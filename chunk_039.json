Yunker, Tim Still, Matthew A. Lohr, A. G. Yodh, \"Suppression of the coffee-ring effect by shape-dependent capillary interactions,\" Nature 476: 308--311, 18 August 2011.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10344\n\nAbstract: \"When a drop of liquid dries on a solid surface, its suspended particulate matter is deposited in ring-like fashion. This phenomenon, known as the coffee-ring effect, is familiar to anyone who has observed a drop of coffee dry. During the drying process, drop edges become pinned to the substrate, and capillary flow outward from the centre of the drop brings suspended particles to the edge as evaporation proceeds. After evaporation, suspended particles are left highly concentrated along the original drop edge. The authors show experimentally that the shape of the suspended particles is important and can be used to eliminate the coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles are deposited uniformly during evaporation. The anisotropic shape of the particles significantly deforms interfaces, producing strong interparticle capillary. Thus, after the ellipsoids are carried to the air--water interface by the same outward flow that causes the coffee-ring effect for spheres, strong long-ranged interparticle attractions between ellipsoids lead to the formation of loosely packed or arrested structures on the air--water interface. These structures prevent the suspended particles from reaching the drop edge and ensure uniform deposition. Interestingly, under appropriate conditions, suspensions of spheres mixed with a small number of ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition. Thus, particle shape provides a convenient parameter to control the deposition of particles, without modification of particle or solvent chemistry.\"\n\nThe first part of the movie shows an evaporating suspension of spheres is shown under bright field microscopy at a higher magnification. Individual spheres are seen as they are transported to the drop contact line, resulting in a ring-like deposit. This drop exhibits the coffee ring effect.\n\nThe second part of the movie shows a an evaporating suspension of ellipsoids is shown under bright field microscopy at a higher magnification. Individual ellipsoids are seen adsorbing to the air-water interface where they form loosely-packed structures. The final deposition is relatively uniform. This drop does not exhibit the coffee ring effect.\n\nThe third part of the movie shows a region near the contact line in an evaporating suspension of ellipsoids is shown under bright field microscopy at a higher magnification. Individual ellipsoids are seen adsorbing to the air-water interface where they form loosely-packed structures. These structures prevent ellipsoids from reaching the contact line. This drop does not exhibit the coffee ring effect.\n\nThe fourth part of the movie shows a region near the contact line in an evaporating suspension of spheres is shown under bright field microscopy. Individual spheres are seen packing closely at the contact line, resulting in a ring-like deposit. This drop exhibits the coffee ring effect.\n\nAnd the fifth part of the movie shows a region near the contact line in an evaporating suspension of ellipsoids with added surfactant is shown under bright field microscopy at a higher magnification. The added surfactant decreases the surface tension. As a result, individual ellipsoids are seen packing closely at the contact line. Unlike suspensions of ellipsoids absent surfactant, this drop exhibits the coffee ring effect.", "title": "coffee-ring effect and its suppression by shape-dependent capillary interactions", "publishedDate": "2011-08-17T22:57:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1P8jFCbhW10", "description": "pa que te  la vasile :D yayayajuuuuuu", "title": "ella es una G 47 Corp", "publishedDate": "2014-02-13T16:21:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "1P9nvCrKImY", "description": "Where did we first get Chlorine?\n\nChemist: Gera Hermann\nDirector: Michael Harrison\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison", "title": "The Chemical Elements: The Discovery of Chlorine", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T06:10:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1PAHnWKHUZw", "description": "Grosseto - Sequestrate 4.400 piante papavero da oppio.

Transition elements!\nSome of them are lightweight, and others really dense\nThings they have in common, they form charges, two or more\nAnd some form colored compounds, which is something we adore!\n\nIf you want an element, just tell me once again\nIf its in Group 17, youve got a halogen!\nNonmetals so corrosive, theyre not found in their pure state\nThey can gain electrons like theyre going out of date!\n\nGot one for you in Group 18, and its known as Noble Gas\nIf youre looking for an element that just sits there on its %&@\nIf you wonder why and havent figured it out yet\nTheir valence configuration is a big stable octet!\n\nSo now it should be obvious that everyone should see\nThat properties of elements vary periodically\nAs atomic number increases, the properties repeat\nIn a soothing rhythmic pattern that can form a funky beat", "title": "Chemistry Music Video 15: Elemental Funkiness", "publishedDate": "2009-08-30T02:24:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1PT90dAA49Q", "description": "\"A Wave of Reason\" is the seventh installment in the Symphony of Science music video series. It is intended to promote scientific reasoning and skepticism in the face of growing amounts of pseudoscientific pursuits, such as Astrology and Homeopathy, and also to promote the scientific worldview as equally enlightening as religion. It features Carl Sagan, Bertrand Russell, Sam Harris, Michael Shermer, Lawrence Krauss, Carolyn Porco, Richard Dawkins, Richard Feynman, Phil Plait, and James Randi. \n\nMore science music videos can be found at http://symphonyofscience.com.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n~John \njohn @ symphonyofscience.com \n\nLyrics:\nRussell:\nWhen you are studying any matter\nOr considering any philosophy\nAsk yourself only: what are the facts,\nAnd what is the truth that the facts bear out\n\nSagan:\nScience is more than a body of knowledge\nIt's a way of thinking\nA way of skeptically interrogating the universe\n\nIf we are not able to ask skeptical questions\nTo be skeptical of those in authority\nThen we're up for grabs\n\nShermer:\nIn all of science we're looking for a balance \nbetween data and theory\n\nHarris:\nYou don't have to delude yourself\nWith Iron age fairy tales\n\nPorco:\nThe same spiritual fulfillment\nThat people find in religion\nCan be found in science\nBy coming to know, if you will, the mind of God\n\nKrauss:\nThe real world, as it actually is,\nIs not evil, it's remarkable\nAnd the way to understand the physical world \nis to use science\n\nDawkins:\nThere is a new wave of reason\nSweeping across America, Britain, Europe, Australia\nSouth America, the Middle East and Africa\nThere is a new wave of reason \nWhere superstition had a firm hold\n\nPlait: \nTeach a man to reason\nAnd he'll think for a lifetime\n\nSagan:\nCosmology brings us face to face with the deepest mysteries\nWith questions that were once treated only \nin religion and myth\n\nThe desire to be connected with the cosmos\nReflects a profound reality\nBut we are connected; not in the trivial ways\nThat Astrology promises, but in the deepest ways\n\nFeynman:\nI can't believe the special stories that have been made up \nAbout our relationship to the universe at large\nLook at what's out there; it isn't in proportion\n\nRussell:\nNever let yourself be diverted \nBy what you wish to believe\nBut look only and surely\nAt what are the facts\n\nRandi:\nEnjoy the fantasy, the fun, the stories\nBut make sure that there's a clear sharp line\nDrawn on the floor\nTo do otherwise is to embrace madness", "title": "Symphony of Science -  A Wave of Reason", "publishedDate": "2010-11-22T19:29:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1PTCH4BpR94", "description": "More information??? \n\nReview:\n\n\u00b7

of the'Crackdown of Counterfeit goods'.\n\nShops in Shenyang and the neighboring areas have closed\nto protest against this robbery behavior.\nThe analysis pointed out that the CCP's economy is\ndifficult to maintain, the way of plundering the property of the people until the end,\nthus, they continuously change\nthe ways of plundering.\n\nOn 6thAugust, messages spread on the Internet:\nIn Shenyang, a variety of shops and markets are closed,\neven bathing halls and pharmacies have closed,\nentire businesses have closed.\nOne cannot even find a place to buy a bottle of soy sauce,\nthe atmosphere is one of terror, people are panicking.\n\nThe mainland media reports that next year's Shenyang\nNational Sports Competition has a funding gap totaling more than a billion.\nLiaoning local authorities issued the financial tasks to\nmunicipalities, cities and apportioned to the industrial and commercial households.\nShenyang industry and commerce, health, environmental\nprotection, tax, fire station and public security, and\nother departments took the opportunity to jointly\n'administer the law enforcement'.\nBut they did their utmost to fine the merchants\nin the name of 'Cracking down in Counterfeit goods'.\n\nShenyang Netizen Xiao Li said in a Tencent Microblog,\n'Shenyang Wuai Market, Nanhu Hardware Market, Huaxiang Hardware Market are checked one by one.\nThe checking will enable the discovery of infringements\nbased on a variety of reasons such as a lack of documents.\nThere is no exception that all merchants are unqualified.\nSelling toothpicks without a deforestation permit,\nfine 5000 Yuan, selling tofu without wearing a mask,\nfine 5000 Yuan.\n\nA shop owner from Wuai Street told 'NTDTV',\nthe authorities' so-called 'Crackdown of Counterfeit goods'\nstarted already in the middle of July, a few days ago, big or\nsmall shops have all closed and do not want to play with the authorities.\n\nShop owner: \"We have all closed, a few days ago, because\nShenyang was completely checked, they said that\nthey do not have money for the 2012 National Sports\nCompetition, they fine us for almost small things,\nfor example, three out of five certificates, health card,\nanyway, if you are caught, you have to pay.\nA bigger place can be fined up to\n50,000 to 100,000, small places 20-30,000.\"\n\nThe Shenyang merchants have closed collectively to protest\nagainst the government robbery behavior.\nCurrently, this 'closing'tide spreads to the surrounding\nmedium and small cities,\nincluding Anshan, Fushun, Dandong and other places,\nregardless of industry, all are closed.\n\nOn the 7th, Liaoning Public Security Bureau posted a notice\ninforming that, the Shenyang 'Crackdown of Counterfeit goods' will pause.\nThe Wuai Street shop owner said, the authority sent\ntroops to broadcast on the streets that:\nsomeone incited rumors, which scared many merchants to\nopen the door, but there are still some did not open.\n\nHead of the 'Rights movement'organization,\nHu Jun, pointed out that,\nthis kind of thing which happened in Shenyang\nseem ridiculous to the outside world, in fact, it is a very common phenomenon in China.\n\nHu Jun:\"We can now see the real estate and land sales, (CCP)'s\nplundering of the property of the people has to go elsewhere,\nthen they think of other ways to plunder merchants.\nThey cannot take the blatant way to plunder;\nthey change the pattern, to take any measures to\nfind an excuse for plundering.\"\n\nHu Jun said that the CCP's autocratic system itself is\na predatory economic system.\n\nHu Jun: \"It (CCP) relies entirely on plunder,\n\nit does not depend on the interaction of providing services\nand the fair exchange between each other.\nIt depends on who has the power, and who can plunder.\n\nIn China everyone knows that as long as you are\nan officer you will have money,\nif you have money you can become an officer,\nthis is contrary to a principle of market transactions, which caused this situation.\"\n\nJun Hu pointed out that, now what we see is that\nthe merchants strike in Shenyang and the neighboring areas.\nMore and more people will go to the streets to strike.\n\nHe analyzed, now the CCP's economy has been\ndifficult to sustain,\nfrom the laws of economic development,\nthe CCP's disintegration is inevitable.

Palmer, Burt Sugarman\nScreenwriter: James Carrington, Hesper Anderson, Mark Medoff\nFilm Description: Children of a Lesser God is a love story about a speech teacher who falls for a beautiful yet distant deaf girl in a small New England school for the deaf, and the obstacles that they face due to their differences. William Hurt plays James Leeds, a renegade teacher with an unconventional approach to education and a resume that includes stints as a bartender and a disk jockey. Upon his arrival, he is warned by school administrator Dr. Franklin (Philip Bosco) not to get creative with his instruction. Naturally, Leeds already has his mind set on his teaching plan and proceeds to play loud rock music in class in order to teach the students to feel the vibrations of the music and get them to try to speak phonetically. But a new element enters his life when he meets the attractive custodian, Sarah (Marlee Matlin). An exceptionally intelligent yet extremely bitter young woman, Sarah is a graduate of the school who has decided to remain there, in the confines of her world of silence; it's safer for her to be with her own \"people\" than to face what she perceives as a cruel and uncaring world. She hardly seems interested in James and will only communicate with him through signing, although she can read lips and even speak a little. James learns from Sarah's mother (Piper Laurie) that Sarah was sexually molested as a teenager; this explains why she is so wary of his attempts to form a relationship with her and why she is so full of fear. Eventually, James does get through to Sarah and the two fall in love, although both have to learn new ways to communicate their feelings. Though it seldom resembles the Mark Medoff play on which it was based, this directing debut from Randa Haines won an Best Actress Oscar for Matlin, for her first screen performance.\n\n\"children of a lesser god\",\"william hurt\",\"william d byrd\",\"frank carter jr\",\"philip holmes\",\"georgia ann cline\",\"allison gompf\",\"john f cleary\",\"randa haines\",\"chair videos\",\"romantic dramas\",tearjerkers,\"patrick j palmer\",\"burt sugarman\",\"candace koethe\",\"determination videos\",\"encouragement videos\",\"improvement videos\",\"classroom videos\",\"school videos\",tony,johnny,danny,cheryl,lydia,glen,\"james leeds\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9273,/m/016khd", "title": "Children of a Lesser God (1/7) Movie CLIP - Picking Up Hearing Girls (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T09:33:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Pb3sekHcjA", "description": "The European Space Agency will attempt to land the Rosetta orbiter onto a comet on Wednesday Nov. 12, 2014.

These nest colonies are usually found on thorny trees or palm fronds and the nests are often built near water or hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily. They are widespread and common within their range but are prone to local, seasonal movements mainly in response to rain and food availability.\n\nMale of race philippinus displaying at nest\nMale of burmanicus race with the bright yellow crown\n\nAmong the population variations, three subspecies are recognized.

It provides 3500 mgs of l-leucine for increased protein synthesis, a total of 7000 mg's for bcaas, and over 4500 mgs of glutamine, citrulline malate and electrolytes. It also doesn't contain any sugars or carbs.

Let's take a look at the active ingredients.\nL-Leucine (3500 mgs)\n- One of the major uses of L-Leucine is for building muscle mass. \n- This amino acid helps to promote strength and energy while working out.\n- Another related benefit of L-leucine is for preventing the damage of muscle tissue in the body. \n- This amino acid helps to keep the body in an anabolic state.\nL-Glutamine (2500 mgs)\n- After excessive physical exercise, the body may suffer from muscle breakdown. \n- In this condition, the glutamine level in the body is reduced which in return induces the catabolic function of the stress hormone cortisol. \n- Glutamine is essential for blocking cortisol and therefore is known to impart anti-catabolic properties.\n- Another major benefit of glutamine is its ability to increase nitrogen retention. \nL-Isoleucine (1750 mgs)\n- This promotes the production of hemoglobin thereby strengthening the blood cells to gain maximum energy to repair tissue damage.\n- This amino acid also helps  with the production of energy.\n- It's also useful for maintaining the required level of nitrogen for the body to remain healthy and fight against certain diseases.\nL-Valine (1750 mgs)\n- It helps with faster recovery from muscle fatigue and, therefore, helps bodybuilders and athletes to improve and maintain their strength.\n- This amino acid also supports the function of various other proteins and amino acids in the body thereby improving the ability of the nervous systems to perform various cognitive functions effectively.\nCitrulline Malate (1000 mgs)\n- Used by the body to increase plasma levels of the amino acid L-Arginine. \n- Recent studies show that the use of Citrulline Malate effectively raises L-Arginine plasma levels more effectively than taking L-Arginine itself.\n- Citrulline Malate may also serve to increase nitrogen production, reduce lactic acid build up, and increase overall atp production.\nFinal Verdict\nXtend has been a long time favorite for many bodybuilders when it comes to BCAA supplements. The user can expect:\n- Increased energy\n- Decreased recovery time\n- Increased lean muscle mass\nHowever, draw backs to consider are:\n- It's a bit pricey\n- Tub doesn't last that long\nIf you'd like to know when xtend goes on special, visit rawmusclegain.com and sign up using our form.

Developed by Gustav Cassel in 1920, it is based on the law of one price: the theory states that, in ideally efficient markets, identical goods should have only one price.\n\nThis purchasing power exchange rate equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies in their home countries for a given basket of goods. Using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards on the whole between nations because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of different countries, rather than just a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) comparison. The best-known and most-used purchasing power parity exchange rate is the Geary-Khamis dollar (the \"international dollar\").\n\nPPP exchange rates (the \"real exchange rate\") fluctuations are mostly due to market exchange rates movements. Aside from this volatility, consistent deviations of the market and PPP exchange rates are observed, for example (market exchange rate) prices of non-traded goods and services are usually lower where incomes are lower. (A U.S. dollar exchanged and spent in India will buy more haircuts than a dollar spent in the United States). PPP takes into account this lower cost of living and adjusts for it as though all income was spent locally. In other words, PPP is the amount of a certain basket of basic goods which can be bought in the given country with the money it produces.\n\nThere can be marked differences between PPP and market exchange rates. [1] For example, the World Bank's World Development Indicators 2005 estimated that in 2003, one United States dollar was equivalent to about 1.8 Chinese yuan by purchasing power parity [2] \u2014 considerably different from the nominal exchange rate that put one dollar equal to 7.6 yuan. This discrepancy has large implications; for instance, GDP per capita in the People's Republic of China is about US$1,800 while on a PPP basis it is about US$7,204. This is frequently used to assert that China is the world's second-largest economy, but such a calculation would only be valid under the PPP theory. At the other extreme, Japan's nominal GDP per capita is around US$37,600, but its PPP figure is only US$30,615.", "title": "PPP - Purchasing Power Parity - MBACalculator.com", "publishedDate": "2009-03-08T08:53:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1QJ1sTfoU9k", "description": "This is the program I followed to reverse chronic kidney disease\nhttp://onesource.tk/kidneybl\n\nHello everybody, this is Mike. \nA lot of you have watched the video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Bt0fXMWqU ) about how I've got off kidney dialysis and are asking about my health condition and my kidney disease. \nFirst of all I want to thanks for the interest.\nMy latest blood work showed another improvement in kidney function and - in my doctor's opinion - this proves that the kidney failure treatment I'm still doing has actually reversed and cured chronic kidney disease. \nI'm feeling better every day. Kidney dialysis is a thing of the past. \nMore info here: http://onesource.tk/kidneybl\nI had to start kidney dialysis in 2011, when I had a renal failure. In 2012 I was on dialysis three days a week and things weren't going to get better. I thought all hope was gone. \nThen I discovered something that changed my life. I've written extensively about this program - feel free to browse my blog: http://00kidney.blogspot.com/p/my-journey-to-get-off-kidney-dialysis.html\nResults were immediate, regained kidney function in just two short months. In six months I was able to quit kidney dialysis.

Here are some extra-effective ways to keep your clothes looking as good as the day you bought them.\n\n\nStep 1: Hand-wash delicate knits\nLaundering cashmere or wool knits in the washing machine, even on the delicate cycle, can cause them to run and unravel. Instead, hand-wash them in the sink or a bowl with liquid detergent. Squeeze suds through the fabric instead of rubbing, and rinse thoroughly. \n\nStep 2: Dry knits\nWringing knits weakens the fabric; instead, gently squeeze the water out. Then, lay the item flat on top of a towel, roll it up inside the towel, and press to remove more water. Unroll it, and spread it on a flat surface to dry.\n\nStep 3: Separate colors from whites\nSeparate color fabrics from all-white clothes before washing. In the colors pile, separate colors by intensity. Wash brights, which are more likely to bleed, pastels, and dark colors in separate loads.\n\nTip\nIf colors run, wash the stained clothes again while they're still wet, and the dye should wash out. \n\nStep 4: Wash darks in cold\nMachine-wash darks in cold water on the shortest cycle, using liquid detergent specially formulated for dark and black clothing. It will keep dyes in dark fabrics from washing out and fading. \n\nTip\nTurn colored clothes inside-out before washing them to preserve their hue.\n\nStep 5: Tackle the whites\nWash all of your whites in hot water, unless the label specifies another water temperature. If you notice your whites becoming dull after a few washes, add color remover to the wash, which you can buy at the supermarket or online. \n\nTip\nYou can also try oxygen bleach. Chlorine bleach can leave a yellow tinge on whites, especially if you wash in hot water.\n\nStep 6: Line-dry\nNo matter what color they are, line-dry clothes whenever possible, avoiding direct sunlight. Fold clothes in half over the line and secure with clothespins. If you use the dryer, choose the lowest temperature setting for the material. High heat shrinks and warps fabrics.\n\nStep 7: Put clothes away the right way\nSome clothes, like those made from linen or cotton, stay wrinkle-free if they're hung up, while knits retain their shape better if you fold them. Fold long dresses, too, since hanging tends to stretch them out. \n\nDid You Know?\nThe Phoenicians developed a process of extracting purple dye from snail glands.

This is Kerry\u2019s recap of the discussions. \n\nThe National Assembly for Wales is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people, makes laws for Wales and holds the Welsh Government to account. One of the ways the National Assembly for Wales holds the Welsh Government to account is through committees, such as the Health and Social Care Committee, who are currently reviewing legal highs in Wales. \n\nMembers of the Health and Social Care Committee met with service providers from across north Wales including service providers from the police, NHS, and local councils to discuss their Inquiry into New Psychoactive Substances. You can find more information about this inquiry here: http://senedd.assemblywales.org/mgConsultationDisplay.aspx?ID=135  \n\nThe north Wales visit was held simultaneously with an event held in south Wales . Here is a link to all of the videos taken during this inquiry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAiwHW5TKfkGo7P-NpsxYme-XAO_ucUQ_\n\nThe Committee will now consider their findings and write a report which will include recommendations to the Welsh Government.

Ma \u00e8 il maestro Ciaramella ad intuire le sue doti di cantante melodica. Dotata di volont\u00e0 e carattere, accett\u00f2 una scrittura in America e nel 1926 debutt\u00f2 a New York con tale successo che il pubblico entusiasta la proclam\u00f2 \"regina degli emigrati\". \nEra partita da Napoli per una tourn\u00e9e di 24 mesi: rest\u00f2 in America 29 anni. Ebbe il suo picco di massimo successo negli Stati Uniti con la canzone \"'A cartulina 'e Napule\". \nFiera della sua origine napoletana, ne faceva, con i suoi spettacoli, una continua esaltazione. \nLo stato di belligeranza che l'11 dicembre 1941 coinvolse gli Stati Uniti nel II conflitto mondiale, trov\u00f2 Gilda Mignonette sul palcoscenico del Teatro Majestic di New York mentre presentava lo spettacolo \"Tunisi italiana\". Si ribell\u00f2 alle autorit\u00e0 che chiedevano la sospensione delle rappresentazioni e trasfer\u00ec lo spettacolo in un teatrino di periferia istituendo, a sue spese, mezzi di trasporto per il pubblico. Osteggiata e bandita da ogni programma radiofonico, si prodig\u00f2 per tutta la durata delle ostilit\u00e0 ad aiutare i prigionieri di guerra italiani.\nDopo una paziente opera persuasiva convinse il marito, Frank Acierno, a tornare in Italia. Era il 1953, aveva 63 anni. Annuci\u00f2 lo spettacolo d'addio per il 22 marzo all'Accademia musicale di Brooklin. Cinquantamila furono le richieste di biglietti. Bloccata da un incidente, il commiato slitt\u00f2 al 17 maggio. Si present\u00f2 su una sedia a rotelle, avvolta in un vestito tricolore, e con il Vesuvio come sfondo: cant\u00f2 le sue pi\u00f9 belle canzoni tra la commozione generale.\nSi imbarc\u00f2 dieci giorni dopo sulla nave \"Homeland\".

He is a furry red monster with a falsetto voice, who hosts the last full fifteen minute segment on Sesame Street, Elmo's World, which is aimed at toddlers. He was most often puppeteered by Kevin Clash, until Clash's resignation in late 2012 and has recently been performed by Ryan Dillon,[2][3] though Peter Linz has also provided his voice in recent performances but denied he would be taking on the character full time.\n\nCookie Monster is a Muppet on the children's television show Sesame Street. He is best known for his voracious appetite and his famous eating phrases: \"Me want cookie!\", \"Me eat cookie!\", and \"Om nom nom nom\" (said through a mouth full of food). He often eats anything and everything, including danishes, donuts, lettuce, apples, bananas, as well as normally inedible objects. However, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind; oatmeal cookies are his second favorite. In a song in 2004, Cookie Monster revealed that, before he ate his first cookie, he believes his name was Sid.[1][2][3] Showing awareness of healthy eating habits for children, since 2006 he has said that cookies are \"a sometime snack\" and that he also likes fruits and eggplant.\nHe is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin, who all share his characteristic blue fur and \"googly eyes\". He also has a father, who appeared in a Monsterpiece Theater sketch promoting energy conservation, water conservation and environmentalism. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his Sesame Street friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.", "title": "Elmo VS Cookie Monster (ThatsSoNathan)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T21:08:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1QnSGCqg438", "description": "El Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN) fue el ej\u00e9rcito que el Che Guevara fund\u00f3 en Bolivia junto a los hermanos Peredo, el a\u00f1o 1967.

All these fish were taken from a point extending into the mainlake.  The water was slightly muddy and ~2-3' deep with a reasonably hard bottom.  Whereas Medlock used his signature jig I went  to a punch skirt setup which made it alot easier to flip to little pockets way back in the grass beds.  When it came to where to put the bait, I simply looked for holes/gaps in grass, junctures of 2 types of grass, and lonely/isolated clumps - basically areas that, if the water was clean, you'd normally see swept off spots.  One of the biggest keys to this deal is slowing down.  These fish are eating it on a reaction strike but they're still bedding fish.  Letting the bait sit after the initial fall for a just a second and then shaking  the bait just briefly seemed to really put them over the edge.", "title": "lake okeechobee, 1-22 6+lbs flipping, .75oz d&m custom baits punch skirt, beaver 001.avi", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T13:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1QwimNyq5cw", "description": "a love song", "title": "Akee _Baby", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T09:51:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Qwpm-aKLMI", "description": "\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432.\n\u041c\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0439\u0440\u0438 -

Seeing the fast interceptor vessel sitting dead in the water, the Yushin Maru No. 2 picked up its speed and began approaching her rapidly at a very high speed of 19 knots.\n\nAnticipating that the whalers might attack a stationary Gojira, the Steve Irwin readied a Delta boat. Upon orders from Captain Paul Watson, the Delta crew set out to turn the approaching whaler away. The Delta crew headed towards the harpooner at full speed getting ready to deploy a prop fouler. This caused the whaling vessel to make an abrupt turn to port. The Delta pursued the fleeing Yushin Maru No. 2 for 11 miles delivering a dozen stink bombs onto the deck of the whaler before returning back to the Steve Irwin.\n\nMeanwhile, pilot Chris Aultman had landed his helicopter on the Bob Barker some 75 miles to the south along the ice edge of the Ross Sea. The Yushin Maru No. 2 made a move to push through the ice to approach the Bob Barker with the objective of turning their water cannon onto the helicopter. Aultman was able to get his helicopter airborne before the harpooner closed in. The Bob Barker then turned to confront the whaler, causing the whaler to turn and flee back through the ice.\n\nIt has been one week since the whaling fleet was discovered. Two of the harpoon vessels have been under constant observation and have not killed any whales. The Nisshin Maru and one other harpoon vessel the Yushin Maru No. 1 have\nfled for over 1,200 miles since the discovery of the fleet on December 31st.

Thompson, Terry Gilliam, Tony Grisoni, Tod Davies, Alex Cox\nFilm Description: Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of \"gonzo journalism.\" Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. \"This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs,\" says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether \"you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it.\" The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox.

Budgerigars are the only species in the Australian genus Melopsittacus, and are found wild throughout the drier parts of Australia where the species has survived harsh inland conditions for the last five million years. Budgerigars are naturally green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings, but have been bred in captivity with colouring in blues, whites, and yellows, greys, and even with small crests. Budgerigars are popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, ability to mimic human speech, and playful nature. The origin of the budgerigar's name is unclear. The species was first recorded in 1805.\nThe budgerigar is closely related to the lories and the fig parrots. They are one of the parakeet species, a non-taxonomical term that refers to any of a number of small parrots with long, flat and tapered tails. In both captivity and the wild, budgerigars breed opportunistically and in pairs.", "title": "Cute Budgie playing with a pin cushion (Funny)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T12:52:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RFfK6ZD_Ho", "description": "The music for The Junkyard and The Pipeline, the first stage of the 1988 Williams arcade game.

This environment can effectively serve as brine, while the other salts in solution cake and adhere to the dead body to complete the petrification.\n\nLocated just north of Natron, Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano is the source of the concentrated salts found in the lake. A unique volcano and a favorite to petrologists, it does not spew the common, red-hot silicate magma. Instead, it emits natrocarbonatite magma, which erupts cool and dark and is rich in sodium and potassium carbonate, along with other minerals. Rainwater sweeps the natrocarbonatite runoff into the lake, hence the name Lake Natron.\n\nCalcified bats, flamingoes, doves, eagles have been turning up on Lake Natron's shores. No one knows for certain how the birds arrived at their fate. Some researchers suspect that they were swept into the lake only after death. Others speculate that they plunged into the deep while traversing the lake. \n\nDespite its deadly waters, Lake Natron's quiet shores are a prime breeding spot for the endangered lesser flamingo, offering safety from predators and food in the form of a blue-green algae that thrives in the warm, alkaline environment.", "title": "Tanzania lake water petrifies fallen animals", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T17:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RI4G4ppHY8", "description": "", "title": "Best quality Ilmenite ore concentrate plant supplier in Pakistan", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T01:03:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RIAGvFzIxI", "description": "Levon on\"THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL\"1980.", "title": "Sissy Spacek & Levon Helm-Coal Miner's Daughter", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T14:53:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RIKWrzXxzo", "description": "Sommarcupen 2010.

Edward Cole (Nicholson) is a corporate billionaire who is currently sharing a hospital room with blue-collar mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman). Though initially the pair seems to have nothing in common, conversation gradually reveals that both men have a long list of goals they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket, and an unrealized desire to discover what kind of men they really are. But one can't accomplish such lofty objectives from the confines of a hospital bed, so now, in order to live their lives to the absolute fullest, Edward and Carter will have to make a break for it. With a checklist that includes playing the poker tables in Monte Carlo, consuming copious amounts of caviar, racing the fastest machines on four wheels, and much more, these two terminally ill men will do their best to fit a lifetime of experience into their last remaining days while forging an unlikely, but truly remarkable, friendship.\n\n\"the bucket list\",\"the bucket list clip\",\"the bucket list part 1\",\"the bucket list full movie\",\"the bucket list soundtrack\",\"morgan freeman\",\"jack nicholson\",\"parachute videos\",comedy,tearjerkers,\"jeffrey stott\",\"rob reiner\",\"alan greisman\",\"frank capra iii\",\"craig zadan\",\"neil meron\",\"travis knox\",\"justin zackham\",\"fear videos\",\"freedom videos\",\"friendship videos\",\"airplane videos\",\"carter chambers\",\"edward cole\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++354039,/m/055c8,/m/09fb5", "title": "The Bucket List (1/4) Movie CLIP - Skydiving (2007) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T03:59:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RIUDjQpAlI", "description": "Turn of the Century Penny Arcade Automatons Attract Rubber Necks and Western Reserve Party Goes in a Magical Moment in 2009.", "title": "Rubber Necker Party Short Film", "publishedDate": "2010-03-23T03:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RIUkLyYPrE", "description": "My English bulldog playing with a door stopper in our new apartment.", "title": "English Bulldog vs Door Stopper", "publishedDate": "2012-03-13T02:48:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RJ5jvhb9TM", "description": "The bodies of Miss Honduras, Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, and her sister were found \n\nWednesday buried in a small mountain village, police officials said.\n\nThe reigning beauty queen and her sister, Sophia Trinidad Hernandez, 23, went \n\nmissing last week only three days before they were to leave for London for the Miss \n\nWorld competition.\n\nThe pair had been attending a birthday party Thursday night in the resort city of \n\nSanta Barbara, about 120 miles northwest off the capital, Tegucigalpa.

There are many applications and tools available which help you to adjust and apply suitable display settings on your LCD screen. In this tutorial we would be using the windows color calibration system.\n\nStep # 1 -- Launch the Color Calibrating Application\nIn the first step, click on the start menu and type \"Calibrating Display Color\" in the search box. Windows will display the color calibrating application in the search result. Click on it to open the application.  \n\nStep # 2 -- Home Screen\nA home screen of the application will appear right in front of you. Click on the \"Next\" button to continue. \n\nStep # 3 -- Display Guides\nIn the next window, a general guide would be displayed, giving you all the details related to the color settings. You can learn a few procedures from this description. However, if you wish to let windows do it automatically, click on the \"Next\" button. \n\nStep # 4 -- How Does Best Gama Look\nIn next step, three boxes with small dots will appear on your screen. These boxes show examples of the Gama range. First box from the left shows too low Gama, middle box shows the perfect Gama and the last one shows a higher range of Gamma. Carefully view the best Gama range box and memorize how it looks. Once done, click on the \"Next\" button.\n\nStep # 5 -- Adjust Gama Properties\nNow on the next screen, try to recall the best Gama range box and adjust the Gama accordingly. There is a slider available on the left side of the window to adjust the Gama range. You can also set the default settings by clicking on the \"Reset\" button. After adjusting it, click on the \"Next\" button.\n\nStep # 6 -- Brightness Guide\nNow a complete guide will be displayed right in front of you showing you how to manually adjust the brightness of your screen. Follow these instructions if you want or click on the \"Next\" button to continue with the calibrating process. \n\nStep # 7 -- Perfect Brightness Example\nThis window will provide you with three examples related to the brightness. The first picture from the left shows a darker image, the middle picture shows the perfect setting and the last one shows an example of a brighter screen. Like the previous step, memorize the best brightness example and click on the \"Next\" button to continue. \n\nStep # 8 -- Adjust the Brightness Level\nUse the keyboard to adjust the brightness of your screen. These settings can also be adjusted from the \"On screen buttons\" available in front of your LCD screen. Adjust the brightness and proceed to the next step by clicking on the \"Next\" button. \n\nStep # 9 -- Perfect Contrast Example\nThree examples of the contrast levels would be displayed next. The first one from the left shows lesser contrast levels; the middle picture shows the perfect contrast level and the last one shows higher contrast levels. Memorize the perfect contrast example and move on to the next step by clicking on the \"Next\" button. \n\nStep # 10 -- Adjust Contrast Level\nIn the next step, adjust the contrast level of your screen by using the \"On screen buttons\" available in front of your LCD screen. Adjust them according to the best contrast example which was displayed in the previous step. After making the proper adjustments, click on the \"Next\" button to continue. \n\nStep # 11 -- Perfect Color Balance Example\nIn the following step, you will see a perfect color balance example. Now click on the \"Next\" button to manually adjust the color balance yourself. \n\nStep # 12 -- Adjustment Of Color Balance\nIn this step, there are three color sliders available. These sliders can adjust Red, Green and Blue colors respectively. Adjust these sliders which best suites your preference and then click on the \"Next\" button to move towards the next step. \n \nStep # 13 -- Compare Previous And Current Calibration\nIn the last step, you can compare your previous color and brightness settings with the current display, after applying the calibration settings. Switch to the view which you like the most. There is also the option of \"Clear Type Tuner\", right at the bottom side of the window. Select this option to open it after completion of the calibrating process and then click on the \"Finish\" button to exit. \n\nStep # 14 -- Turn On the Clear Type Option\nClear Type is the latest option available in windows which allows the screen fonts to appear brighter and clear. Once the Clear Type Tuner window has opened, click on the check box to enable the clear type option and then click on the \"Next\" button.", "title": "How To Do an LCD Monitor Calibration", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T11:33:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RpgsWeE1Kw", "description": "Habituation and Sensitization Learning Psychology Tutorial", "title": "Habituation & sensitization?", "publishedDate": "2013-12-03T21:09:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Rpmfb4s0T0", "description": "\u25d5  \u25d5  Filthy Children Collective \u25d5  \u25d5 \n\u03a6\u03a6 // Sydney, Australia // \u03a6\u03a6\n\nTrack 13 of 20 from Chillection, released for free through Wood and Wire.\n\nhttps://filchil.bandcamp.com/album/chillection-wood-and-wire\nhttp://woodandwire.com.au/project/ww28-filthy-children-chillection-wood-and-wire/", "title": "Canecutter - Orange", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T11:23:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RpuhN2Qcr0", "description": "Poetry (from the Greek poiesis \u2014 \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u2014 with a broad meaning of a \"making\", seen also in such terms as \"hemopoiesis\"; more narrowly, the making of poetry) is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic[1][2][3] qualities of language\u2014such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre\u2014to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\nPoetry has a long history, dating back to the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "To Sleep by William Wordsworth", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:34:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Rq-AegoAEs", "description": "Dire\u00e7\u00e3o: Marcos Rombino\nDire\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Conte\u00fado: Jos\u00e9 Roberto Walker\n\nA Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica Brasileira, sob a reg\u00eancia do maestro Roberto Minczuk, interpretou a obra \"Dan\u00e7a  Brasileira\" do compositor \"Mozart Camargo Guarnieri\" no concerto de abertura da temporada 2014 realizado no dia 17 de mar\u00e7o, na Cidade das Artes no Rio de Janeiro.", "title": "OSB Apresenta - \"Dan\u00e7a Brasileira\" de Mozart Camargo Guarnieri", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T21:25:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Rq0ZZuaMg8", "description": "", "title": "Cascade Platinum \"Stalling\" Commercial", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T15:23:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Rq4INmvNLM", "description": "MD.

The key elements are the plate, the crown, the lid, the design mold, the ladle, and the press.\n\nIn addition to a vast collection of historic bronze design molds, Granada Tile also make new molds constantly so clients can match their tile to their style. \n\nEach area of each tile is handpoured. We have bestsellers that we keep in stock. We also do custom tiles. Clients use our online Echo Collection Catalog to color their tiles. \n\nEach tile is pressed to 3,000 PSI. This fuses the layers and makes the tile very strong. \n\nThe finished tile is 5/8\" of an inch thick and the color layer is 1/8\". Once the tile has cured, it will be packed, shipped, and installed. The result is a floor or wall that will last a life time. \n\nBecause of the handmade process and natural ingredients, these tiles exude an organic beauty.", "title": "Making Hand Made, Eco-Friendly Cement Tiles - short version", "publishedDate": "2011-08-22T04:01:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RsKB3P-z6Y", "description": "Guy coming out of Home Depot spills house paint onto 23rd St. sidewalk.

I felt tingly, like my blood was being cleansed (it was). It was so cool!\nMy bedroom smells like a casserole, but it was totally worth it!\n\n\n***Here is the deal***\nSo last night I wasn't feeling to good. I got up, went to the kitchen and sliced an onion at 1 am. I got some snug socks and put it on the bottom of his feet to boost my  immunity. During the rest of the night, I started feeling good. I mean really good! I felt tingly, like my blood was being cleansed. It was so cool!\n\n\nNote: \n\n1.) Onions are known to absorb toxins. In fact, during the days of the Plague in England, folks would keep chopped onions around to absorb toxins and clean the air. This helped protect them, against getting the plague. You can do this to!\n\nNEVER SAVE AN ONION!! It will absorb all the toxins in the air of your refrigerator. Eat that and you eat the toxins. Instead: Chop your left over onion, put it on a plate and keep it in your kitchen as a natural air purifier. I do this all the time! If someone is ill, place a chopped onion on the night stand, next to the bed. They'll be better in the morning. I placed the remaining onion, next to my bed to cleanse the air.\n\nOnions are toxin absorbers. Thus why they are great internal mops for the body. Eat plenty of onions!\n\n2.) The onion and garlic families are anti-microbial and anti-bacterial. Placing them on the bottom of the foot gives them access to your internal organs through meridians in your body. The onion can be directly delivered. Trans-dermal delivery (on the skin) is one of the best delivery mechanisms, as it will bypass the stomach acids and go directly into the blood. The bottom of the feet and the forearm are great places to put high powered foods and essential oils into the body. Sliced garlic on the bottom of the feet will work nicely too.\n\nGood luck!!", "title": "Remove toxins from your feet with a ONION!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T16:47:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RxHLRlzc3I", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/EnglishVN\n------------------------ \nLanguage Studies International English TOEFL / TOEIC / IELTS Preparation Courses at Cambridge, England, USA, AUS...", "title": "How to Pronounce Endocrine", "publishedDate": "2013-09-07T18:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RxP2mj3Cys", "description": "Very Nice, jument \u00e0 vendre par Zonlicht - 4 ans Qualification - Mai 2013 - Sainte M\u00e8re Eglise : http://www.elevage-flagues.fr/selle-francais/sf-a-vendre/3/very-nice.html", "title": "Very Nice, jument \u00e0 vendre", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T08:32:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RxPk_JsyXE", "description": "Trattasi di fungo ALTAMENTE TOSSICO che d\u00e0 luogo a GRAVI DISTURBI GASTRICI!!Ne video si hanno altre spiegazioni!", "title": "P TRICHOLOMA  TIGRINUM", "publishedDate": "2011-05-12T11:48:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Rx_9NsCWxo", "description": "Eurobeat flash vol.14", "title": "Honey honey / Milk and coffea", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T09:43:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RxgV2LjjGE", "description": "Kari L\u00f6vaas sings \"Margaret`s cradle song\"  \n\"Margaretes vuggevise\", op. 15 No. 1\nby Edvard Grieg (1843-1907)\nBerliner Sinfonieorchester\nEduardo Marturet, conductor", "title": "Kari L\u00f6vaas \"Margaret`s cradle song\"  Grieg", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17T07:09:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Ry7lMl75Vo", "description": "Download this karaoke song (MP3, MP4, WMV or MP3+G formats available)\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/store/store.html?vid=20081002001&cid=4042&keyword=Ring+Of+Fire\n\nSing, record and share this karaoke song online:\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/online/#sid=10705\n\nOr get The KARAOKE Channel Mobile App and take this karaoke song to go!\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/mobile/", "title": "Ring Of Fire in the Style of \"Johnny Cash\" karaoke video with lyrics (no lead vocal)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-02T20:21:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1RyDOHv3Mlk", "description": "I show these fetal pig videos the day before I do my fetal pig dissections with my classes.

Thumbnail: IMG_0890_Web by Eric MARTEEL/ericmarteel/Flickr\n\n\nLike to say a couple words about the backhand clear and the technique of doing an effective backhand clear. It's a very difficult shot for a lot of beginners, as opposed to the typical forehand clear. And, start off with the right backhand grip. Typically you want to hold the grip, place your thumb somewhere between the broad part of the grip, which is this, and the narrow part of the grip. So, it should be right in between there. Somewhere at the apex of the grip. The motion of the backhand swing is a rotation of the elbow, not a wrist flick. So, you want to be doing this. I'll do it a couple times very slow. I'll show you what not to do. You don't want to do this. This is typically, never a shot in badminton. As a matter of fact, if you do this too vigorously you can damage the tendons and the ligaments in the wrist. Now, I'd like to say a couple words about the point of contact when you hit a backhand overhead clear. You want to strike the shuttle when it's, more or less, directly above your head or even a little bit behind your head. So, I'm going to do the full backhand swing. Contact and then you follow through. I'll do it again. Contact, shuttle and then follow through. You notice that it's a full rotation of the elbow and not a wrist flick. So, I'll do it a little bit faster. And, just as a reference point, the forehand is exactly the opposite. Again, it's a elbow rotation, not a wrist flick. Okay. And that's your basic backhand clear.", "title": "2 Backhand Techniques | Badminton Lessons", "publishedDate": "2012-05-23T22:30:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1S1Nkxn7tdY", "description": "Dopamine produces vasodilation in the kidneys.

Albums and singles for leading global labels such as Border Community and Traum Schallplatten have established Fairley as a key player in the world of electronic music, whilst his perpetual travels across land and sea, bringing his live sets to the masses, have bonded him with music lovers on the four corners of the planet. The past few years have seen Fairmont spreading his musical wings, with the his techno killer 'All Dreams Are Nightmares' on Areal and the disco tinged 'Emax/Bercy' on Beachcoma, but it is perhaps with his recent gothic/indie inspired releases on Border Community and Traum that he has given the clearest insight to where his future sound lies.\n\nThat future has seen Jake Fairley join forces with one of Canada's hottest exports of recent times, the ever- excellent My Favorite Robot Records. The Robot crew have been a long time followers of Fairmont's career and when the opportunity came up to sign him for MFRR, they jumped at the chance: one listen to Fairmont's latest LP and it's abundantly clear that this was a very wise move. 'Automaton' is a perfect fit for the Toronto imprint with his dark & melancholic yet heart warming mix of richly produced electronica and vocal led songs.\n\nFrom the up tempo and stirring opener 'Creatures of Night' it's clear that Fairley will be pulling no punches; robustly mixed and taut with atmosphere, his vocals carve a channel through the deeply hypnotic electro influenced backing, whilst the live guitar parts give the record a distinctly 'indie' edge. This indie sound in fact runs throughout the album, from the soaring melodics of 'Waiting' to the quirky shuffle of 'Last Dance' and on to the gothic eighties inflected 'Tiny Diamonds'. 'Automaton' is an album that deftly marries influences from across the decades, fusing 70s and 80s synth sounds with electro elements and themes from modern techno, electronica and indie pop. It is a darkly melodic record that highlights the broad musical talents of Fairmont and his ability to bend genres at will and is a wonderful insight into the world of this ever-evolving artist.\n\nIn line with the release there will be a full album tour showcasing, a new incarnation of the Fairmont live show, highlighting Fairley's unique ability to perform what is simultaneously a rocking stage show and a killer dance-floor set.\nReleased by: My Favorite Robot Records\nRelease/catalogue number: MFR062\nRelease date: Nov 5, 2012", "title": "Fairmont - Slowing Down", "publishedDate": "2012-11-07T10:25:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1S7CkzKILH0", "description": "Launched at Agritechnica 2007, the Holmer Terra Felis sugar beet cleaner/loader made its UK debut near Ickburgh, Norfolk, on February 3, 2009, at a field demonstration organised by the brand's UK importer Standen-Reflex.

You can finish off the braid in any accessory you like (bow, flower clip, etc.)\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHFrenchBraid\n\nEnjoy!", "title": "How to French Braid #2 | Braided Hairstyles | Cute Girls Hairstyles", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T01:59:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1S8aNKOnzcE", "description": "\"\u041d\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043b\u044d\u043b \u0445\u04af\u04af\" \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043b\u0442\nTsetse FB Page: http://www.facebook.com/Tsetse220000\nVanquish FB Page: http://www.facebook.com/VanquishOfficial", "title": "TSETSE feat.

This technology has recently been patented in the United States.\nThe joint research team developed innovative technology which improves PET radiopharmaceutical drug production rates by 40%, and now, it is under review for patent in 30 countries around the world.\nThe production rate refers to the amount of radiopharmaceutical drugs to be produced when raw materials (100) are inputted. If the new technology is applied, the production rate would increase from 1% to 40%. In other words, the innovative technology would make mass production possible.\nProfessor Oh Seung-joon / Department of Nuclear Medicine\nThe newly patented technology is original technology which makes the mass production of radiopharmaceutical drugs possible through a PET test. In particular, this technology has been applied to FPCIT to diagnose Parkinson's disease. AMC has used it in examining and diagnosing patients with Parkinson's disease and checking the effect of medical treatment.\nDr. Ji Dae-yoon / Future Chem\nAMC and Future Chem have played a leading role in the production of radiopharmaceutical drugs in the world. The joint research establishes a bridgehead to spread the technology throughout the world.\nPET scans, which have been widely used to detect cancer, are also useful in detecting neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's at an early stage using diverse radiopharmaceutical drugs.\nHowever, the radiopharmaceutical drugs used in PET scans have been short in terms of radiological duration, which made it difficult to achieve mass production.

Learn More: http://www.ApexNatural.com/curcumin   \n\nTurmeric Curcumin Benefits: Natural Anti-Inflammatory\n\nCurcumin Anti-Inflammatory\n- Anti-inflammatory is a key feature of curcumin\n- Numerous Studies on the Anti-inflammatory properties of Curcumin\n- Studied for helping with Rheumatoid arthritis and Osteoarthritis and for other potential areas like cancer treatments and coronary applications related to inflammation.\n\nCurcumin Anti-Inflammatory Definition:\n\"The anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin is most likely mediated through its ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). COX-2, LOX, and iNOS are important enzymes that mediate inflammatory processes. Improper upregulation of COX-2 and/or iNOS has been associated with the pathophysiology of certain types of human cancer as well as inflammatory disorders.\"\n\nCommon Treatment for inflammation is NSAIDs:\nAlthough NSAIDs are effective, there are known risks. They can inhibit COX-2, but they also can inhibit COX-1. The problem is COX-1 inhibition \"switches off\" functions like the repair and maintenance of stomach lining, which results in varying degrees of gastric health issues... the most significant of which is gastrointestinal bleeding. \n\nRheumatoid Arthritis:\nIn a preliminary double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, Curcumin was compared to a NSAID(phenylbutazone) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Curcumin was given at 1200mg daily and deemed effective improving joint swelling, walking time, and morning stiffness among test patients. Phenylbutazone provided a greater benefit but curcumin did provide beneficial results.\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) Study:\nOne smaller human study identified curcumin as working as well as ibuprofen for OA sufferers: \nResearchers from Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand conducted a study to determine the efficacy and safety of a turmeric extract in reducing pain and improving function in patients with knee OA. Of 190 patients screened for the study who had primary knee OA , 107 were selected for the study and were randomized to receive ibuprofen (800 mg daily) or turmeric curcumin(500 mg curcuminoids 4 times daily) for 6 weeks. \nBoth groups experienced a similar degree of improvement in their symptoms, and the side effects did not differ between the groups. These results suggest that curcuminoid extracts of turmeric might be as effective as ibuprofen in alleviating knee pain and improving knee functions, and advocates suggest curcumin has less adverse side effects on the body over time.\n\nTurmeric Curcumin Anti-Inflammatory Summary:\n- Turmeric curcumin has been used naturally for generations for helping with inflammation.\n- Inflammation in the body can be a root cause of many ailments. \n- Curcumin is the key compound within Turmeric that researchers are focused on.\n- Researchers currently conducting more studies and evaluating higher dose application(new delivery forms of Curcumin).\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Turmeric-Curcumin-ADVANCED-Standardized-Curcuminoids/dp/B00FE7WN68", "title": "Turmeric Curcumin Anti Inflammatory Presentation", "publishedDate": "2014-01-03T17:38:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SK1ocUlAbQ", "description": "disco polo 2014\n1.)

This free video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this bird's nest fern video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nAsplenium nidus is a species of fern in the family of Aspleniaceae. It is a fern medium sized, stocky, shiny leaves. It is native to the rainforests of New South Wales and Queensland in Australia along the Great Dividing Range, parallel to the East Coast of the country. Also you can find it in New Guinea, tropical areas of Southeast Asia and Africa, Tahiti and Hawaii. The larger specimens are given to northern Queensland (where they can achieve the amazing size of 22 dm high and 2 m wingspan), while the lowest would be in the central coast of New South Wales, although there are theories that suggest that the other second species is a different gene. Its common name is Fern \"bird's nest\" because of its shape. This name translates from English \"Bird's Nest Fern,\" although it is also known as \"Crow's Nest Fern\" Fern = \"crow's nest\" for its ditintiva form when given free.\n\nThe bird's nest fern is a perennial herbaceous plant. The fronds of nest fern are kurzstielig, broad, smooth, slightly wavy on the edge and shine in lush greenery. The plant is increasingly tight up to 1 meter tall and with age. The up to 50 cm wide fronds form a funnel crown in which is wafted earth gathers as in a nest from which the young leaves unfurl. Its natural distribution has the bird's nest fern in the rain forests of East Africa, tropical Asia, Australia and Polynesia. There he grows epiphytic on trees. As an indoor plant in pots it is popular.\n\nIt is an epiphyte in its environment. It can be grown in highly aerated media loamy, slightly acidic. It is preferred continuously high humidity, a diffuse light and a temperature of about 20 \u00b0 C. The nest fern is an epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestrial fern with placed in bundles of 50 to 150 cm long, light green undivided leaves with a black center grain and wavy leaf margins. There is no difference between the sterile and fertile blades. The spores boxes are located in transverse rows on the underside of the blade, from the midrib to close to the blade edge. When the spores mature, the leaves roll up and form a huge brown nest among the branches of the trees.\n\nThe nest fern lives mainly epiphytic plant trees where he water and humus collects in the cup formed by its leaves. He prefers warm and vochige place at least partially in the shade. It is found in tropical regions. These spikes are easily recognized because of a large canopy, entalnya can reach a length of 150cm and width 20cm, leaf resembles a banana. Peruratan single pinnate leaves. Color bright green leaves, and yellowing when exposed to direct sunlight. spores located on the underside of strands, the leaf veins, with sori covered in some sort of elongated sacs. Frond-ental which dries to form a kind of \"nest\" that ride on the branches of trees. \"Nest\" is that stores water and other epiphytic plants can be grown.\n\nThese spikes mostly epiphytic, but actually can grow anywhere as long as there is organic matter that provides nutrients. Because the plants under the canopy, he likes shade. In Hong Kong, this type is protected by law. Paronychia can be planted both in supporting the stump, as well as directly in the pot, containing a light blend of land for epiphytes. Do not allow to dry out the root ball. Requires irrigation and fertilization during the growing season (from spring to early autumn). Semidarkness or solar. A temperature of 10 to 30 \u00b0 C.\n\nEpiphytes use photosynthesis and obtain moisture from the air or rain that is deposited on the surface of its host. Epiphytes not parasitize their host, but only grow independently obtaining physical support. The most obvious regarding other herbs restricted to the ground advantage is receiving more light on the shady ecosystems forest and kept away from herbivores. However so tight as to damage the host plant may develop.\n\nThe best known epiphytes include mosses, lichens, orchids, ferns and bromeliads, but can be found in all major groups of the plant kingdom. Accumulations of large epiphytes occur most abundantly in tropical rainforests and temperate rainforests, but both lichens and mosses found in any environment with trees.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!", "title": "Amazing Symbiont Plant of South Asian Jungle", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T22:43:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SXH2VH7Jjo", "description": "for obadia", "title": "for obadia", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T05:40:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SXYFG48b3U", "description": "A short video and quiz on the location, structure and neurotransmitters associated with adrenergic neurons.", "title": "Adrenergic Neurons", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T22:49:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SXZhMuXnkU", "description": "How to fit a  BMW e46 325 ci M3 K&N   Induction Kit Air Filter \n\nany questions about this video please ask me \n\nplease subscibe me", "title": "How to fit a BMW e46 325 ci M3 K&N Induction Kit Air Filter INTAKE SYSTEM  sounds great", "publishedDate": "2013-01-20T12:02:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SZ63qlYVgI", "description": "Die Partyband SHEEPWALK live auf der Black & White Party im TURMBR\u00c4U in Freudenstadt am 6.8.2011", "title": "Black & White Party mit SHEEPWALK im TURMBR\u00c4U Hochzeitsband Partyband", "publishedDate": "2011-08-10T15:02:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SZA_gGI9KQ", "description": "", "title": "Het dode dennenbos  Ecologische armoede 1.wmv", "publishedDate": "2011-07-25T20:20:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1SZBio1B1UA", "description": "Based at UQ's renowned St Lucia campus, the School of Tourism is one of Australia's largest dedicated providers of teaching and research programs in tourism.

This is a genetically inherited disease. He goes to kidney dialysis three times a week. Now his kidneys are failing and need a transplant.

They used this photo for a story about ISIL. With the lightest expression, this is shamelessness, sordidness and ignobleness,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said while addressing the Chamber of Turkish Tradesmen and Craftsmen\u2019s (TESK) general assembly on Sept. 17.\n\nThe New York Times reported that some 100 people have joined the ranks of ISIL from the Hac\u0131 Bayram Veli Mosque in Ankara, indicating that its locals tried to approach Erdo\u011fan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu to raise the issue of ISIL recruitment when the two went to the historic mosque in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe are the country that has paid the heaviest price while fighting terrorism,\u201d he added, referring to Turkey\u2019s 30-year struggle against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been instrumental in stopping ISIL\u2019s advance on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe murders and mass killings were ignored by several countries and others even supported this terrorism. They now understand \u2013 too late \u2013 that one day such terrorism would turn its gun against them,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said.\n\nThe Turkish president then responded to recent criticism on Ankara\u2019s conduct regarding ISIL violence in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cTurkey is against terrorism of all kinds indiscriminately. We have never accepted the concept of \u2018Islamic terrorism.\u2019 Nobody can ascribe terrorism to Islam, which is a religion of peace. We have never accepted concepts like Sunni or Shiite terrorism. We\u2019re members of a religion that rejects sectarianism,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said.\n\nHe also slammed recent media reports that implicated Ankara as being written with a particular \u201cpurpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome international media outlets try to equate Turkey with terrorism. There is no such thing as Turkey offering weapons and medical aid to terrorist groups,\u201d he noted.\n\nErdo\u011fan suggested that an operation of \u201cperception management\u201d has been launched by \"some circles\" and said he would raise the issue during his meetings with world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meetings next week.     \n\nIn a Sept. 17 statement to H\u00fcrriyet, New York Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy stood behind the stories. \"Both stories in question were thoroughly reported and sourced and we feel speak for themselves,\" Murphy said.\n\nAsked whether The Times is concerned about the security of Ceylan Ye\u011finsu, the Times' correspondent in Turkey, due to the smear campaign started by some media outlets in Turkey following Erdo\u011fan's remarks, Murphy said: \"We are of course concerned any time the security of one of our correspondents is at issue. We have confidence that Turkish authorities will ensure the security of a Times correspondent doing her job.\"\n\nThe Times also later posted a correction related to the photo at the end of the story, stating: \u201cA picture with an earlier version of this article, which showed President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu leaving a mosque in August, was published in error. Neither that mosque nor the president\u2019s visit were related to the recruiting of ISIS [ISIL] fighters described in the article.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Erdo\u011fan also criticized the credit rating agencies that have given negative evaluations of the Turkish economy, suggesting that their views were based on \"political motives, rather than economic realities.\"    \n\n\u201cWe pay them money; we pay an annual fee to them. Turkey may cut its ties with two more of them; we didn't develop our economy with their help,\u201d he said.", "title": "Turkish President Erdo\u011fan slams New York Times over ISIL story", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T13:34:05.000Z"}]
