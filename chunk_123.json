So the major muscle group is the tricep. You can do it from a chair or a bench, you can even do it on the floor. So just getting yourself into position to start by rolling your shoulders down. You want to start from good posture. Sometimes we tend to slump forward and then we're gonna potentially cause an extra strain on the shoulder joint. So set yourself up by rolling the shoulders back, opening up the chest. Bringing your hands directly underneath your shoulders onto the bench or onto the ground. And you're gonna take your legs out keeping your knees bent. If you wanted to make it harder you could extend the legs. So start with the easier option, see how you feel first. You're gonna bend the elbows, lowering the hips down, and then exhale to extend the elbows and lift your body up. Inhale down, exhale up. The biggest mistake people make here is when they come down, sinking into the shoulders. You wanna really try to just depress the shoulder blades down your back, so that you keep your neck nice and long. And the other mistake is that people just tend to move their hips up and down. And there's no action going on in the elbow joint itself. The action in the elbow joint needs to be election and extension, because that's gonna engage the tricep muscle. And that's the whole focus of the tricep dip. Elbow flextion, elbow extension start to strengthen the tricep muscle group. Which is that muscle that tends to jiggle on some of us when we wave. So this is a great exercise to tighten it up.", "title": "How to Do a Tricep Dip | Boot Camp Workout", "publishedDate": "2012-05-10T01:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6kAaKjp2OIo", "description": "- OMG *-* , Elle a tout juste 12 ans et elle chante hyper bien ! \u2665 \u2665 \n- A voir absolument !

Eco-businesses employ a total of 3.4 million people across Europe. \n\nThis week, Business Planet takes a trip to Croatia for a closer look at a very specific kind of innovation: noise barriers. \n\nThe noise barriers being built along the motorway near Zagreb are spearheading innovation. They are made up of 40 percent of recycled tyres and are among the most efficient on the market.  \n\nThey are the result of a project launched in 2009 as part of the European Eco-Innovation programme. \n\nOne of the companies involved in their production is an SME which recycles tyres, turning them into a powder used to build the barriers. It's a great opportunity for innovation, says the company's chairman:  \n\n\"If we achieve the goals that were set, we're hoping to hire up to 30 people and double our production capacity,\" says Damir Kiri\u0107, the chairman of Gumiimpex.\n\nThe powder is mixed with cement at another factory, where the noise barriers are moulded. \n\nHere, too, it's hoped the project will help hire an extra 60 people. \n\n\"It's opened up new doors. We're hoping to increase turnover by 25 percent in Croatia, but also in neighbouring countries,\" says the Managing Director of Beton Lu\u010dko, Danica Jeleni\u0107.\n\nIt's a serious investment. Danica Jeleni\u0107 put in 355 000 euros. She is delighted with the result. \n\n\"Taking part in this project has really strengthened our position. We're taken seriously by other players on the market,\" she says.\n\nThe European Eco-Innovation programme gives access to subsidies to launch a project. To this day, it has benefited 200 projects throughout Europe.\n\nThe noise barrier project was born at Zagreb University. It is the brainchild of professor Stjepan Laku\u0161i\u0107. \n\nHalf of the project was funded by the Eco-Innovation programme, which provided half a million euros. \n\nNow, the plan is to sell this innovative technology to neighbouring countries, where there is always a need for fresh ideas on how to recycle tyres. \n\n\"You need 65 tonnes of recycled tyres to produce a kilometre-long barrier that's one metre high. That's 8,000 old tyres,\" says RUCONBAR Project Coordinator Stjepan Laku\u0161i\u0107.  \n\nThis new technology has already attracted a number of potential buyers seduced by the low production cost.  \n\n\"Using recycled products brings down the cost by ten to eighteen percent compared to similar products on the market,\" says Stjepan Laku\u0161i\u0107.\n\nThe chairman of Gumiimpex, Damir Kiri\u0107, describes his recipe for success: \n\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Recycling tyres: road to success - business planet", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T15:09:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6kDAH0mBzuo", "description": "Plea Video from 5'10\" Ivy (20), from Buffalo, NY.", "title": "Ivy's Plea Video for #ANTM #Cycle21", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T20:32:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6kDYdyFP738", "description": "Please Subscribe for more amazing videos http://bit.ly/subSTR\nTweet Steve http://www.twitter.com/STRskillSchool\n\nAmazing Freestyle Footballer Daniel Cutting (DC Freestyle) shows STRskillSchool his Extreme Freestyle skills for STR Freestyle Friday.\nDaniel Cutting\nSUBSCRIBE http://www.youtube.com/danielcutting\nWEBSITE http://www.danielcutting.com\nTweet Daniel http://www.twitter.com/DCfreestyle\n\nSong is called Bullseye by KDrew\nhttp://KDrewMusic.com\nhttp://Soundcloud.com/KDrewMusic\nhttp://Youtube.com/KDrewTV", "title": "Daniel Cutting Freestyle Footballer  - 4 x Guinness world record holder", "publishedDate": "2012-11-23T22:59:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6kDhzoivQHc", "description": "Call 9370669516\nSee more at: \nhttp://penis-enlargement-mumbai.com\nHaving sex longer should be the goal of every guy during intimacy. Did you know the most common complaint women have in regards to sex is the frustration they experience over their partner not being able to last long enough during sex? What happens is that the guy will end up experiencing orgasm, while the woman is left high and dry. And although the guy will orgasm, he will feel extreme embarrassment over ejaculating much too quickly. So, in the end, it's a no win situation for both partners Here's some good news. Females will most often experience orgasm in 10 minutes or less. That means, for men, they only have to learn to last for at least 10 minutes long.

Sometimes making peace with the fact that step parenting is a challenge lowers your expectation to be \"The Perfect Parent\" and can give you the freedom to screw up here and there. Expressing that step parenting is hard doesn't mean you don't love your kids and it doesn't mean its not worth being a part of their lives. Sometimes the hardest roads are the most rewarding.

Adem\u00e1s de ser uno de los dramaturgos m\u00e1s destacados e innovadores del siglo XX, cuyas obras buscan siempre la reflexi\u00f3n del espectador, trat\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n de fomentar el activismo pol\u00edtico con las letras de sus lieder, a los que Kurt Weill puso la m\u00fasica.\n\nComenz\u00f3 en M\u00fanich sus estudios de Literatura y Filosof\u00eda en 1917, a los que a\u00f1adir\u00eda posteriormente los de Medicina. Durante la I Primera Guerra Mundial comenz\u00f3 a escribir y publicar sus obras. Desde 1920 frecuent\u00f3 el mundo art\u00edstico de M\u00fanich y trabaj\u00f3 como dramaturgo y director de escena. En este entorno conoci\u00f3 a F. Wedekind, K. Valentin y L. Feuchtwanger, con quienes mantuvo siempre un estrecho contacto. En 1924 se traslad\u00f3 a Berl\u00edn, donde trabaj\u00f3 como dramaturgo a las \u00f3rdenes de Max Reinhardt en el Deutsches Theater; posteriormente colabor\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n en obras de car\u00e1cter colectivo junto con Elisabeth Hauptmann, Erwin Piscator, Kurt Weill, Hans Eisler y Slatan Dudow, y trab\u00f3 relaciones con el pintor Georg Grosz.\n\n\nBertolt Brecht\n\nEn 1926 comenz\u00f3 su dedicaci\u00f3n intensiva al marxismo y estableci\u00f3 un estrecho contacto con Karl Korsch y Walter Benjamin. Su Dreigroschenoper (Opera de cuatro cuartos, 1928) obtuvo en 1928 el mayor \u00e9xito conocido en la Rep\u00fablica de Weimar. En ese a\u00f1o 1928 se cas\u00f3 con la actriz Helene Weigel.\n\nSer\u00e1 en 1930 cuando comience a tener m\u00e1s que contactos con el Partido Comunista Alem\u00e1n. El 28 de febrero de 1933, un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de la quema del Parlamento alem\u00e1n, Brecht comenz\u00f3 su camino hacia el exilio en Svendborg (Dinamarca). Tras una breve temporada en Austria, Suiza y Francia, march\u00f3 a Dinamarca, donde se estableci\u00f3 con su mujer y dos colaboradoras, Margarethe Steffin y Ruth Berlau. En 1935 viaj\u00f3 a Mosc\u00fa, Nueva York y Par\u00eds, donde intervino en el Congreso de Escritores Antifascistas, suscitando una fuerte pol\u00e9mica.\n\nEn 1939, temiendo la ocupaci\u00f3n alemana, se march\u00f3 a Suecia; en 1940, a Finlandia, pa\u00eds del que tuvo que escapar ante la llegada de los nazis; y en 1941, a trav\u00e9s de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica (v\u00eda Vladivostok), a Santa Monica, en los Estados Unidos, donde permaneci\u00f3 aislado seis a\u00f1os, viviendo de guiones para Hollywood. En 1947 se llev\u00f3 a la pantalla GalileoGalilei, con muy poco \u00e9xito. A ra\u00edz del estreno de esta pel\u00edcula, el Comit\u00e9 de Actividades Antinorteamericanas le consider\u00f3 elemento sospechoso y tuvo que marchar a Berl\u00edn Este (1948), donde organiz\u00f3 primero el Deutsches Theater y, posteriormente, el Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. Antes hab\u00eda pasado por Suiza, donde colabor\u00f3 con M. Frisch y G. Weisenborn.\n\nEn Berl\u00edn, junto con su esposa Helene Weigel, fund\u00f3 en 1949 el conocido Berliner Ensemble, y se dedic\u00f3 exclusivamente al teatro.

IN , FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR , THIS FOLK ART WAS SO POPULAR THAT THERE WERE EIGHT GENEROUSLY PAID PUPPETEERS IN ONE PRINCE'S MANSION. WHEN THE MANCHU RULERS SPREAD THEIR RULE TO VARIOUS PARTS OF CHINA, THEY BROUGHT THE PUPPET SHOW WITH THEM TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT THEY COULD NOT APPRECIATE LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIERS. FROM 1796 TO 1800, THE GOVERNMENT FORBADE THE PUBLIC SHOWING OF PUPPET SHOWS TO PREVENT THE SPREADING OF PEASANT UPRISING AT THE TIME. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1821 THAT SHADOW PUPPET SHOWS GAINED SOME VIGOR.\n\nTODAY, SHADOW PUPPETRY SHOWS FACE EXTINCTION LIKE OTHER TRADITIONAL ART FORMS SUCH AS NUO DRAMA.\n\n FEATURES OF SHADOW PUPPET SHOW\nSHADOW PUPPETRY WINS THE HEART OF AN AUDIENCE BY ITS LINGERING MUSIC, EXQUISITE SCULPTURE, BRISK COLOR AND LIVELY PERFORMANCE.\n\nONE MOUTH TELLS STORIES OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS; A PAIR OF HANDS OPERATES . THIS IS HOW THE SHADOW PUPPETEER WORKS. NICKNAMED THE BUSINESS OF THE FIVE, A SHADOW PUPPET TROUPE IS MADE UP OF FIVE PEOPLE. ONE OPERATES THE PUPPETS, ONE PLAYS A HORN, A SUO-NA HORN, AND A YU-KIN, ONE PLAYS BANHU FIDDLE, ONE IS IN CHARGE OF PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS, AND ONE SINGS. THIS SINGER ASSUMES ALL THE ROLES IN THE PUPPET SHOW, WHICH OF COURSE IS VERY DIFFICULT. THAT IS NOT ALL; THE SINGER ALSO PLAYS SEVERAL OF THE OVER 20 KINDS OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN A PUPPET SHOW. THESE ANCIENT MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ENHANCE THIS ANCIENT FOLK ART.\n\nCHINESE SHADOW PUPPETRY THE STAGE FOR SHADOW PUPPET IS A WHITE CLOTH SCREEN ON WHICH THE SHADOWS OF FLAT PUPPETS ARE PROJECTED. SHADOW PUPPET LOOKS SIMILAR TO PAPER-CUT EXCEPT THAT THEIR JOINTS ARE CONNECTED BY THREAD SO THAT THEY CAN BE OPERATED FREELY. THE SCENE IS SIMPLE AND PRIMITIVE; IT IS THE CONSUMMATE PERFORMANCE THAT ATTRACTS THE AUDIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, A PUPPET CAN SMOKE AND BREATHE OUT A SMOKE RING \u00a8C WITH OPERATOR HELP. IN ONE DRAMA, AS A MAID SITS IN FRONT OF A MIRROR, HER REFLECTION MATCHES HER ACTIONS. THE OPERATOR PLAYS FIVE PUPPETS AT THE SAME TIME, EACH OF WHICH HAS THREE THREADS. TEN FINGERS HANDLE 15 THREADS. NO WONDER THE OPERATOR IS COMPARED TO THE 1000-HAND KWAN-YIN.\n\nTO OVERCOME THE LIMIT IMPOSED WHEN ONLY THE PROFILE OF PUPPETS CAN BE SEEN, SHADOW PUPPETS USE EXAGGERATION AND HEAVY DRAMATIZATION. THE FACES AND THE COSTUMES OF PUPPETS ARE VIVID AND HUMOROUS. THE FLOWERY COLOR, THE ELEGANT SCULPTING AND SMOOTH LINES MAKE SHADOW PUPPETS NOT ONLY PROPS BUT ALSO ARTWORK. A SHADOW PUPPET TAKES AS MANY AS 24 PROCEDURES AND MORE THAN 3000 CUTS.\n\nTHE FIGURES ALL HAVE A LARGE HEAD AND A SMALL BODY, WHICH TAPERS DOWN. A MAN HAS A BIG HEAD AND A SQUARE FACE, BROAD FOREHEAD AND A TALL STRONG BODY WITHOUT BEING TOO MASCULINE. A WOMAN HAS A THIN FACE, A SMALL MOUTH AND SLIM BODY WITHOUT BEING TOO PLUMP. EFFEMINACY AND TENDERNESS ARE THE NORM FOR CHINESE BEAUTY. SCHOLARS WEAR LONG ROBES WITH AN ELEGANT DEMEANOR, WHILE GENERALS IN MARTIAL ATTIRE BRING TO MIND BRAVERY AND PROWESS.\n\nCHINESE SHADOW PUPPETRY THE DESIGN OF THE FIGURES FOLLOWS TRADITIONAL MORAL EVALUATION AND AESTHETICS. THE AUDIENCE CAN TELL A FIGURE'S CHARACTER BY SEEING HIS MASK. LIKE THE MASKS IN BEIJING OPERA , A RED MASK REPRESENTS UPRIGHTNESS, A BLACK MASK, FIDELITY, AND A WHITE ONE, TREACHERY. THE POSITIVE FIGURE HAS LONG NARROW EYES, A SMALL MOUTH AND A STRAIGHT BRIDGE OF NOSE, WHILE THE NEGATIVE ONE HAS SMALL EYES, A PROTRUDING FOREHEAD AND SAGGING MOUTH. THE CLOWN HAS A CIRCLE AROUND HIS EYES, PROJECTING A HUMOROUS AND FRIVOLOUS AIR EVEN BEFORE HE PERFORMS ANY ACT.\n\nLAVISH BACKGROUND PIECES INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE, FURNITURE, VESSELS AND AUSPICIOUS PATTERNS ARE FEATURED IN SHADOW PUPPET SHOWS. EARTHY ART THAT IT IS, SHADOW PUPPET SHOWS IMPRESS AUDIENCES BY THEIR VIVIDNESS AND REFINEMENT. A FRAMED PUPPET CAN BE A NOVEL AND PLEASANT SOUVENIR.\n\n SHADOW PUPPET AS ARTWORK\nBESIDES THE FIGURES NEEDED IN A CERTAIN DRAMA, THE SHADOW PUPPETS INCLUDE HEROES FROM FOLKLORE AND HISTORY, SUCH AS THE FOUR ANCIENT BEAUTIES, XI SHI, WANG ZHAOJUN, DIAO CHAN, AND YANG GUIFEI ; OR THE MONKEY KING, EMPEROR QIN SHI HUANG .\n\nRAJASTHANI RAJASTHAN SONGS SONGYOUTUBE VIDEO  BHAJAN KATHAON COMEDY.COMYOU TUBES MUSICDJ  .COM   HOLIALBUM .COM   DANCE   2013  OF FOR   LIST  OF FOR  MARWARIDANCING MARWARI   OF FOR   OF MARWARIFORNEW TOP 10  TRACKS LATESTHINDI   TOP TEN  TRACKS  OF  HITS MARWARI   HINDI   ALBUM YOU TUBE MARWARI  GEET", "title": "RAJASTHANI YOUTUBE", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T12:22:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6khq-T1a_6Y", "description": "", "title": "Gradius Ultimate Collection 5 -Gradius III SNES- 49 Unpleasant Cell", "publishedDate": "2012-04-05T03:50:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6kiaD5i9-9A", "description": "Jual Beli Batu Chalcedony Keladen Red Baron 1 , Persembahan team MAKRIFAT BUSINESS Sentral Galeri Kerajinan Seni Acecories Souvenir Handicraft Manik Manik Asli Khas Sajian Produk Unggulan Desa TUTUL Balung Jember Jawa Timur,  ini kami jual dengan harga :\nRp.

The plant's Incident Commander requested activation of the EOC to assist in the response to issues that have occurred when the tornado struck.

but also saw some staff \"mock, goad, taunt, roughly handle and ignore\" elderly residents.\n\n\"Some were even left in their own mess for hours,\" she said.\n\nLast November, while Panorama was undercover, the home was inspected by the regulator and passed for the first time in 18 months.\n\nWhen the CQC revisited this February after being told about Panorama's findings, they found too few staff and some residents waiting an \"unacceptably long time\" for call bells to be answered.\n\nAnglia Retirement Homes Ltd, which runs the Old Deanery, said the incidents involved a \"small number of staff\" and were not reflective of the high standards of care it demanded.\n\nA statement said: \"As soon as the new management team was made aware of the allegations we took immediate action.\n\n\"We hired an independent law firm to carry out a full investigation as a matter of urgency.\n\n\"Eight staff were immediately suspended, and have not returned to work, pending a full inquiry.\n\n\"Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our residents and we have more than 200 dedicated members of staff who remain committed to the highest standards of care.\"\n\nIt added: \"The care worker responsible for slapping a resident has been summarily dismissed.\"", "title": "Staff sacking and suspensions over poor elderly care", "publishedDate": "2014-04-30T07:05:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6knCJmn7xms", "description": "B-Reel Commercial Productions\n2011", "title": "Breakstone's Sour Cream Commercial", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T03:26:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6knJhq1oQi4", "description": "\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Geile Bodybuilding Tank Tops: http://algfitness.com\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Meine Supps: http://alongabbay.com/my_supplements\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba BOOM Shirts: http://alongabbay.com/eu/bodybuilding-shirts\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba English Channel: http://alongabbay.com/youtube\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Facebook: http://alongabbay.com/facebook\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Instagram: http://alongabbay.de/instagram\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Twitter: http://alongabbay.com/twitter\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Website: http://alongabbay.com\n\nProdzuiert bei: http://youtube.com/instructionalweekly\n\nKeep working out hard and stay dedicated!

To arrive there, this family has undergone much systematic and taxonomic change. Among those fishes that remain in the Characidae for the time being are the tetras, comprising the very similar genera Hemigrammus  and Hyphessobrycon, as well as a few related forms such as the cave and neon tetras. Fish of this family are important as food and also include popular aquarium  fish species. These fish vary in length, though many are less than 3 centimetres (1 in). The smallest species grows to a maximum length of 13 millimetres (0.5 in). These fish inhabit a wide range and a variety of habitats. They originate in the Americas, ranging from southwestern Texas and Mexico through Central and South America.

Bandipur is known for its wildlife and has many types of biomes, but dry deciduous forest is dominant.\n\nThe park spans an area of 874 square kilometers (337 sq mi), protecting several species of India's endangered wildlife. Together with the adjoining Nagarhole National Park (643 km2 (248 sq mi)), Mudumalai National Park (320 km2 (120 sq mi)) and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (344 km2 (133 sq mi)), it is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve totaling 2,183 km2 (843 sq mi) making it the largest protected area in southern India.\n\nBandipur is located in Gundlupet taluq of Chamarajanagar district. It is about 80 kilometers (50 mi) from the city of Mysore on the route to a major tourist destination of Ooty. As a result, Bandipur sees a lot of tourist traffic and there are a lot of wildlife fatalities caused by speeding vehicles that are reported each year. There is a ban on traffic from the hours of dusk to dawn to help bring down deaths of wildlife.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

This attraction is located in Frontierland beside Splash mountain. It is a lot of fun. It is a fairly mild coaster. A good one for little kids or first timers.\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad (often shortened to Big Thunder Mountain or Thunder Mountain) is an indoor/outdoor mine train roller coaster located in Frontierland at several Disneyland-style Disney Parks worldwide. The ride exists at Disneyland Park (California) and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Park (Paris) as Big Thunder Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is also the name of the fictional rail line the roller coaster depicts.\nAlthough the details of the backstory vary from park to park, all follow the same general story arcs. Some time in the late 1800s, gold was discovered on Big Thunder Mountain in the American Southwest. Overnight, the small mining town of Rainbow Ridge (at Disneyland), Tumbleweed (at the Magic Kingdom), or Thunder Mesa (at Disneyland Paris) became a thriving mining town. Mining was prosperous, and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore. Unknown to the settlers, the Mountain was a sacred spot to local Native Americans and was cursed.[1]\nBefore long, the settlers' desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy, which, depending on the park, is usually depicted to be an earthquake (Disneyland Paris, Disneyland), a tsunami (Tokyo Disneyland), a flash flood (Magic Kingdom), which befell the mines and town, and the town was abandoned. Some time later, the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own, without engineers or a crew. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow tourists to take rides on the possessed trains.\nInspired by real-life Bryce Canyon, the Hoodoos of Big Thunder in Disneyland as seen from the Big Thunder Trail that passes behind the ride.\nIn keeping with the theme, the station buildings on all four versions of the ride are designed to look as though they are the abandoned offices of a mining company from the mid to late 19th century. The mountains themselves are themed to the red rock formations of the American Southwest. The rock work designs on Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad are based on the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah.\nIn the Magic Kingdom version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and in the Tokyo and Paris versions, the rockwork designs are based on the rising buttes that are located in Utah and Arizona's Monument Valley. Special care was taken by the Imagineers to make it appear that the rocks were there originally, and the track was built around the rocks, unlike a number of earlier mine rides, which were built the other way around (by sculpting the rocks around the tracks). The action of the ride takes place completely in the sagging, rotting tunnels of the mountain. In contrast to most steel roller coasters, where the thrills come from the perception of flying through open air, the thrills on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad are meant to come from the perceived instability of the mine and its threats of collapse. Sound effects of a typical locomotive operation are piped into the surrounding scenery to add realism to guests viewing the ride from observation platforms, including the steam whistle sounding, even though there is no whistle displayed on the locomotives.\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad was designed by Imagineer Tony Baxter and ride design engineer Bill Watkins. The concept came from Baxter's work on fellow Imagineer Marc Davis's concept for the Western River Expedition, a western-themed pavilion at the Magic Kingdom, designed to look like an enormous plateau and contain many rides, including a runaway mine train roller coaster. However, because the pavilion as a whole, was deemed too expensive in light of the 1973 construction and opening of Pirates of the Caribbean, Baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction.\nThe Big Thunder Mountain Railroad project was put on hold again in 1974 as resources and personnel were being diverted to work on constructing Space Mountain over in Tomorrowland, but this delay may have ultimately produced a smoother ride as the use of computers in attraction design was just beginning when the project was resumed.

I thought it was a good idea to show what the pain injection looks like, they use the same injection in the shoulder for a torn rotator cuff....  \n\nFor anyone that has been living with knee pain for years.  If you are Fearing a total knee replacement, and you are at the point that it is time to get it looked at and see what your options are then this information is for you....  \n\nAfter an xray of his knee, he has been diagnosed with pretty bad arthritis favoring the back side of his knee as well as a subchondral cyst and a bone spur.  All of these things tend to go hand in hand when arthritis sets in your joints.  Most of the time its due to an injury of the knee but it also happens with the progression of age.  Luckily he had a awesome surgeon that explained his options were steroid shots in the knee and if they worked he would just continue to get the shots as they wear off thru the years and if the steroid shot didn't work there was another shot that filled the knee with a prescription fluid and if that didn't work last resort would be a total knee replacement in which he is definitely a candidate for now.  Since surgery will definitely be the last resort, he went ahead and got the steroid injection in the knee and was told it would take 2-3 days before he would feel relief.. I am proud to announce that the very next day he is feeling much better.  the pain has subsided substantially..\n\nI wanted to post this video so people know you do have options.. If your doctor is quick to schedule you for surgery before trying the less invasive options then you need to find another doctor!  \n\nBelow is some information I found on the google box...\n\nSubchondral cyst formation is characteristic of osteoarthritis and can be routinely found on x-rays. A subchondral cyst is a fluid-filled sac that extrudes from the joint, consisting of thickened joint material (mostly hyaluronic acid, a substance found in normal joint fluid that serves to lubricate the joint).\nSubchondral bone is the layer of bone just below the cartilage. When someone has osteoarthritis, there is increased blood flow and other changes that develop in the subchondral layer -- subchondral sclerosis (increased bone density), subchondral cyst formation and increased pressure within the bone -- all of which may cause osteoarthritis pain.\nThe formation of a subchondral cyst is indicative of an early phase of osteoarthritis. It is often the case that the subchondral cyst improves without medical attention, although the disease itself does not go away. If the subchondral cyst causes discomfort, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide relief, as would avoiding activities that irritate the joint involved.\nThe recommended treatment for a subchondral cyst is to just leave it alone. A subchondral cyst should not be lanced or removed, especially because removal would cause an increased risk of infection or possible problems with wound healing.\n\nKenalog intra-articular/intramuscular injection contains the active ingredient triamcinolone, which is a type of medicine known as a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are hormones that are produced naturally by the adrenal glands. They have many important functions in the body, including control of inflammatory responses. Corticosteroid medicines are man-made derivatives of the natural hormones. They are often simply called steroids, but it should be noted that they are very different from another group of steroids, called anabolic steroids, which have gained notoriety because of their abuse by some athletes and body builders. \nTriamcinolone is a synthetic steroid that has an anti-inflammatory effect. It is used to decrease inflammation in various different diseases and conditions. \n\n\nRead more: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/seniors-health/medicines/kenalog-intra-articular-intramuscular-injection.html#ixzz31Fgh1FU8", "title": "Steroid Injection of the knee for pain!

However, there are some points that are differentiated for neonatal life support. A neonatal patient is 1 month of younger and usually considered a newborn. The main differentiation is that neonatal CPR is primarily airway breathing and circulation focused. Child and infant CPR instead focuses on compressions first. Neonates are so driven from a lack of oxygen that it is the primary concern that they get the oxygen they need. 3 compressions to 1 respiration is recommended for a neonatal patient. Heart rate, blood pressure, movement, and color of the neonate are the primary aspects to look at when providing basic life support.

For an entire year afterward, the man who once routinely hiked 6-7 miles a day in the hills above his Southern California home could not walk a step. \"It scared the heck out of me,\" he recalled. \"I couldn't get up out of bed. I gained 25 pounds, which I still need to lose. I was very depressed. I couldn't work at my job as a machinist at Lockheed Martin or do anything.\" His primary care physician fi rst thought Mark was suffering from peripheral arterial damage caused by his diabetes. But an MRI detected that Mark's inability to walk due to severe pain from his buttocks all the way to his feet was caused by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) in his L3 and L4 vertebrae.\n\nWhat is Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)?\n\nLSS is a narrowing of the spinal canal that impinges on the nerves in the spinal canal or on the nerves exiting to the legs. This can lead to persistent pain in the buttocks, limping, lack of feeling in lower extremities and decreased physical activity. LSS is the largest indication for back surgery in people over 50, who make up the fastest growing demographic population in the world. It is estimated that 1.2 million people in the United States alone suffer from LSS, with over 200,000 diagnosed patients admitted to U.S. hospitals annually. Patients who are diagnosed with LSS initially receive conservative treatment such as bed rest, support devices, physical therapy and pain medications before moving on to surgical remedies. Initially, conservative treatment allowed Mark to walk short distances and return to work. \n\nDiscovering an Option to Major Surgery\n\nAfter three years of conservative treatment, Mark was fed up with his inability to walk more than six minutes without feeling severe pain. He was in constant pain at his job, where he stood most of the time. Mark refused to consider major back surgery such as a laminectomy because he feared at his age he would never heal completely from the procedure where bone is removed. He was losing hope that anything could be done for his pain. Then his general practitioner suggested that he talk to surgeons at the University of California, Los Angeles. There he met orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Arya Nick Shamie and learned of a new, minimally invasive surgical procedure with Kyphon's X-STOP\u00ae Interspinous Process Decompression System.\n\n\"Mark was the perfect candidate for this surgery since his pain went away when he sat down or fl exed forward and came back when he stood up or started walking,\" said Dr. Shamie. \"The X-STOP spacer puts the patient's spine in a seated position even when standing up.\"\n\nMark was impressed with Dr. Shamie's knowledge of the procedure and felt confi dent knowing that he was renowned for his expertise with the X-STOP spacer. Since being trained on the procedure in 2005, Dr. Shamie has performed approximately 80 surgeries.\nOn November 19, 2007, Mark was implanted with an X-STOP spacer, which increased the area of the spinal canal and relieved the pain caused by his LSS. He was under local anesthesia and the entire procedure took about an hour.\n\n\"Dr. Shamie told me that I would probably need to stay in the hospital for one day, but 30 minutes after the surgery I was up and walking with no pain, so I went home that day,\" Mark said. \"My symptoms were reduced instantly. Even now, I have no pain in my lower legs or buttocks. It is perfect. I would have done this sooner if I had known about it.\"\n\nLooking Forward to Pain Free Life\n\nMark is looking forward now to retiring next year and working part-time as an aircraft mechanic. This retirement dream, he said, is something he couldn't have realized without the X-STOP procedure. He is getting back in shape by walking every day with his dog in the hills above his Southern California home. \"My dog really missed that. Before my surgery, I hadn't walked with her in 2\u00bd years,\" Mark said. \n\nLearn more at www.spinecenter.ucla.edu or www.uclahealth.org/NickShamie", "title": "X-Stop Spacer Treatment for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis", "publishedDate": "2010-05-28T21:41:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mK329Xvsr0", "description": "", "title": "Heavy T Bar Rows", "publishedDate": "2013-09-15T23:36:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mK4FLNL5mw", "description": "Georgia's Jasper Sanks \"fumbles\" at the goal line.

They have a degree in engineering or science, they understand patent rules and laws, work with the patent office and even have to pass a difficult exam to be submitted to the patent bar. Now, a patent attorney is all that -- and more! A patent attorney also gives you the bonus of being a lawyer. So if your patent issue has to go to trial, your patent attorney is ready. If your patent application has issues that cause you to go to court, your patent attorney is there and involved. Watch the video to learn more. \n\nFor more information about patent law and my firm, visit our educational website at http://www.beemlaw.com, which includes a rare collection of Presidential patents.

Simit's quick take on Steve Nison:\n\n   -- Candlestick expert who is a clear communicator; Simit says he learned candlesticks mainly from individuals who have learned from Nison, and from watching Nison's DVDs and videos directly. Simit values Nison largely for being such a clear communicator, and for providing many detailed examples traders can learn from. \n\n-- Nison offers numerous products, including DVD sets to a subscription membership community. The DVD sets are what Simit is familiar with and thinks positively of. The membership community contains the option to chat with Steve and other traders, get daily and weekly videos from Steve regarding setups in the market, and access a huge archive of setups to go through. \n\n-- Steve mentions that he uses candlesticks across all markets, and with his personal money, uses candlesticks to manage long-term retirement accounts. He developed a bullish take on equities as the S&P broke out above 1500, citing 2300 as a reasonable target based on candlesticks and price action. \n\nIf you have any questions on Nison, join us in the review thread here: http://www.informedtrades.com/1794313-free-steve-nison-candlestick-course-review.html", "title": "Steve Nison: Review and Free Candlestick Trading Course", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T12:28:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mOe33kvf44", "description": "Band: Ace Hood and Rick Ross\nTitel: My Speakers\nJahr: \n\nAce Hood\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/#!/ACEHOOD\nOfficial: http://acehood.defjam.com/#!news\nWikipedia: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Hood\n\nRick Ross\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/rickross305\nOfficial: http://rickrossdeeperthanrap.com/#!all\nWikipedia: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "title": "Ace Hood Feat.

Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through an agarose matrix. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving. The purpose of the gel might be to look at the DNA, to quantify it or to isolate a particular band. The DNA is visualized in the gel by addition of ethidium bromide. This binds strongly to DNA by intercalating between the bases and is fluorescent, meaning that it absorbs invisible UV light and transmits the energy as visible orange light.", "title": "Agarose Gel Electrophoresis - Amrita University", "publishedDate": "2010-10-14T03:58:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mQGlyZ1VbI", "description": "\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uba38\ub9ac \uc815\uaddc\uc568\ubc94 \ubc1c\ub9e4 \uc804 \uc120\uacf5\uac1c\uace1 '\ub3c5(Feat.

industry. The song starts with how so much time continues to go by and all he wants is to be free, but because of all the restraints, he feels half-gone. He expresses having to hide his real emotions from his friends and family because he wants to get on with his life without them being affected by his pain. Long days and restless nights, all the while he has trouble recognizing who he has become. The song ends with how he knows he needs to slow down and just stop to think about how we've all gotten caught up in the small things and forgotten what's important.", "title": "MV_\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uba38\ub9ac(Primary)_\ub3c5(Feat.E-Sens of \uc288\ud504\ub9bc\ud300)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-24T04:16:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mQMa6vm-nU", "description": "", "title": "Miller and Urey", "publishedDate": "2012-06-06T18:46:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mQMzYosO30", "description": "Truck falls off cliff due to overload", "title": "Live : Truck falls off cliff due to overload", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T15:14:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mQPjjZvcJ0", "description": "Pr\u00e9sentation de l'antenne Lecher standard (celle du livre de D.

These are the paragon of beauty and present a landscape full with scenic and picturesque extravaganza. These islands shimmer like emeralds in the Bay of Bengal. The dense forest which cover these islands and the innumerable exotic flowers and birds create a highly poetic and romantic atmosphere. \"Here the white beaches on the edge of a meandering coastline have palm trees that sway to the rhythm of the Sea. The beat of tribal drums haunt the stillness and technicolour fish steer their way through crystal clear water.\" This addition of strangeness to beauty which is responsible for creating the infinite romantic impact may be described in the following famous lines of Keats. \n\nThe natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest, with mangroves on the coast. The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma. Most of the forests are evergreen, but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, Middle Andaman, Baratang and parts of South Andaman Island. The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of epiphytic vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids.\n\nThe Andaman forests are largely unspoiled, despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on Little Andaman, Narcondam, North Andaman and South Andaman, but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests. Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of Interview Island and North Andaman.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, Andaman & Nicobar website\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In fact, the Society holds all 435 of Audubon's preparatory watercolors for his renowned prints series The Birds of America. Since too much light can destroy their delicate colors, we rotate the displays in this Niche every three months.  From his early twenties, Audubon was obsessed by one idea: to observe, record, and publish images of all of the species of birds in North America. During his life, people recognized Audubon's bird watercolors as both important documents of natural history and dazzling works of art. Audubon was one of Americas greatest watercolorists and he depicted birds in new ways. He was the first to show all the birds life size and interacting with each other. He also showed different sexes, ages, and seasonal plumages of the same species. Today, we also value his images because they include species that became extinct, and today they live only in his watercolors. Audubon and his wife Lucy hoped that his collection of watercolors would stay in the United States after his death in 1851. Both the New-York Historical Society and the British Museum wanted to buy the collection.  But the $4,000 asking price for the collection was a large sum at the time, and too high for the Historical Society. For a while it seemed that the bird paintings might end up in the UK. But after a year of private fundraising, in 1863 the Society acquired the collection of 434 preparatory watercolors for The Birds of America, along with around 50 other works. Later in the 1960s, donors gave the Historical Society the final preparatory watercolor and a rare copy of whats called the double-elephant folio edition of The Birds of America, printed on the largest size of paper available. And those gifts made this national treasure complete.\n\nThe New-York Historical Society is able to produce illuminating exhibitions, public programs, and make a priceless collection accessible to the public through the generosity of donations and membership.

Bagian akhir sistem pencernaan adalah kolon atau usus besar yang bertugas menyerap cairan dan membentuk limbah padat (tinja) dan mengeluarkannya dari tubuh.\nRadang usus besar merupakan kondisi serius dan kronis yang dapat berakibat fatal pada kasus yang sangat parah. Radang usus besar adalah kondisi di mana satu atau beberapa bagian usus mengalami radang. Ukuran usus besar manusia dewasa memiliki panjang sekitar 5 kaki dan letaknya yang berliku-liku yang merupakan organ sebagai media tempat menyimpan dan menyerap sari pati makanan untuk tubuh\n\nJika radang atau luka hanya terjadi pada lapisan permukaan usus besar, disebut colitis. Jika di dubur disebut proctitis. Dan jika terjadi pada usus besar dan dubur, maka Anda disebut menderita colitis ulserative. Radang biasanya dimulai dari dubur dan menyebar ke usus besar, tapi tidak meluas sampai usus halus. Akibat yang Anda rasakan adalah diare.\n\nRadang usus menyebabkan sel-sel yang melapisi dinding usus mengelupas, terjadilah luka terbuka pada dinding usus (tukak) yang kemudian mengeluarkan lendir atau nanah. Pada kasus ini, diare sering disertai lendir, darah dan nanah.\nKetika peradangan menembus dinding usus, maka Anda disebut menderita penyakit Crohn. Penyakit ini selain menyerang usus besar juga menyerang usus halus atau bagian lain dari saluran pencernaan. Risikonya, terkena kanker usus besar (32%) karena penyakit ini menyebabkan sel-sel selaput lendir usus besar menjadi embrio kanker (disebut displasia).\n\nProses Terjadinya Radang Usus Besar\n\nProses radang usus dapat dimulai dimulai ketika terjadi sumbatan di muara saluran usus, misalnya karena tinja atau feses yang terperangkap dan mengeras. Hal ini menimbulkan suatu kondisi usus dapat pecah dan dapat menginfeksi rongga perut bagian dalam dan organnya.\nRadang usus besar sering terjadi karena sembelit (konstipasi), gelisah atau keguguran. Namun, penyebab utama terjadinya colitis adalah kurangnya zat-zat organik di dalam tubuh yang dapat membantu lancarnya fungsi usus besar. Makanan dimasak yang terdiri atas atom-atom mati tidak dapat membangun sel-sel dan jaringan tubuh.\n\nPenyebab timbulnya penyakit Radang Usus Besar\n\nPenyakit radang usus besar umumnya dapat terjadi akibat adanya infeksi yang disebabkan oleh bakteri, konsumsi makanan yang tidak sehat seperti seringnya konsumsi makanan yang pedas, asam, mie instan dan makanan siap saji.\n\nDi samping itu, penyakit radang usus besar dapat terjadi akibat adanya efek samping dari penyakit yang sebelumnya ada seperti terjadinya pembesaran jaringan limfoid, penyakit cacing, adanya benda asing yang terdapat dalam usus dsb. Jika peradangan pada usus besar lama tidak diobati akan semakin memperparah keadaan dan berakibat fatal pada munculnya gejala kanker usus besar.\n\nSolusi Pengobatan Terbaik Untuk Radang Usus Besar\n\nRadang usus besar atau yang dikenal dengan colitis adalah penyakit yang merupakan peradangan pada usus besar. Gejala pada radang usus besar termasuk diare terkadang keluar feses kecil-kecil hingga sembelit, rasa nyeri, demam, bengkak pada jaringan usus besar, berdarah, perdarahan rektal dan luka pada usus besar.\nPenyakit ini disebabkan karena adanya infeksi bakteri, pola makan yang salah dan makanan yang sulit dicena sampai usus besar.\nMengobati radang usus besar dengan tanaman herbal haruslah memilih tanaman yang berefek mengatasi peradangan, memperbaiki organ yang rusak serta meredakan rasa sakit yang menyertainya.\n\nDikutip dari berbagai sumber\n\nTERKAIT:\ncara mengobati penyakit usus besar tanpa operasi\ncara mengobati penyakit usus besar secara alami\ncara mengobati radang usus secara tradisional\nradang borok usus besar ulcerative colitis\nmengobati radang usus besar tanpa operasi\ncara mencegah penyakit radang usus besar\ncara mengobati radang usus secara alami\nobat tradisional radang usus untuk anak\ncara mengobati penyakit usus 12 jari\ncara mengobati penyakit infeksi usus\nobat tradisional radang usus 12 jari\ncara mengobati penyakit radang usus\nradang usus besar diversion colitis\ncara mengobati penyakit usus besar\nradang usus dan cara pengobatannya\nmengobati radang usus secara alami\ncara mencegah penyakit usus besar\nradang usus besar dan gejalanya\nradang usus besar tanpa operasi\ngejala radang usus besar ringan\n\nUNTUK LEBIH LENGKAPNYA, KUNJUNGI  : http://solusisehatcerdas.blogspot.com\nFACEBOOK FANPAGE : https://www.facebook.com/pembuangracuncerdas\nLOKASI  : Jatiasih,Bekasi", "title": "cara mengobati penyakit radang usus", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T08:18:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mhbxlz_wrI", "description": "Super Friends, Wonder Twins short.", "title": "Wonder Twins Gopher moat", "publishedDate": "2006-03-08T17:11:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mhzCBxivXY", "description": "The Institute of Womens Health of North America is a non-profit 503(c)(3) organization committed to improving women's health through clinical care, research, education and community outreach.

The Wayanad ghat road, located between Puthuppady in Kozhikode district and Vythiri in Wayanad district is the most beautiful ghat road in southern India. It was categorized as NH-766 (previously known as NH-212). There are nine hairpin bends in this 14 km long pass.\n\nThamarassery is well connected to its surrounding areas via road transport. Bus services to nearby towns like Kozhikode, Koyilandy, Adivaram, Sulthan Bathery, Mukkam, etc. are available regularly. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has a bus stand and depot at Thamarassery. All private buses operate from the New Bus Stand at Karadi nearby the KSRTC depot. Nearest airport, the Calicut International Airport is 56 km away, while the Kozhikode Railway Station is 30 km away.\n\nHistory behind Thamarassery Churam\n\nSometime, you may feel the history as a funny one. But it has been told by the ancestors. During the time of foreigners' rule, it was difficult to get into the green paradise Wayanad. But most of the foreigners liked Wayanad the most. It's spices and beauty attracted them the most. But there was not a better route to Wayanad. They tried to make many passes. But it didn't reach any where. The head of a tribal community know the best access to Wayanad. He told them the way, the Thamarassery Churam. They constructed the pass and said that it was their idea and plan. Moreover the real founder was hanged to death. Then it is said that his soul made the travel through the pass difficult. He threw away the vehicles into the valley and all. Then he was chained to a tree and the problem is then solved. You can see the tree still standing near the pass with chain bounding.\n\nThe main attractions in Wayanad Churam\n\nMany tourism hot spots are located around the town. Thusharagiri Falls is situated 20 km from the town.\n\nThe view point is another attraction. This is situated above the ninth hairpin bend, at a height of 2000 feet above sea level.. This place provides an excellent view of the green forest beneath. You can see the heavy vehicles moving up, taking long turns in the hairpin bends and the miniature view of small towns beneath. The cunning monkeys will be here too. You can feed them. \nNo problem, but you have to take every responsibility. \n\nChain tree is the place where the real founder of the Pass is chained. There is an interesting feature about this tree. Although this tree is getting taller, the straight chain hanging on the tree has been just touching the ground.\n\nThings to Note\n\n1.There is no need to plan a tour to Thamarassery pass. \n2.When you are visiting Wayanad you can easily enjoy the pass.\n3.There are many tourist destinations near the pass. Pookot, Lakkidi are very close to the pass.\n4.Try to avoid your trip during monsoon. This is the time when there are large traffic blocks in the pass and chances of accidents are more.", "title": "Thamarassery Churam Wayanad Churam History Main Attractions Renovated Hairpin Road", "publishedDate": "2012-09-17T17:39:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6mo26VXjmO4", "description": "report on tax-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

These movable flotation elements may take the form of inflatable bellows, movable or foldable flotation aids, or other forms. Such systems have been bulky, required additional moving parts/components1 and can be prone to failure. As such, an amphibian motorcycle with a hull that does not require additional bellows, provides sufficient buoyancy for the amphibian to float in the water, and yet allows the amphibian to adequately lean/turn while on land would be desirable. \n\nThe amphibian may comprise one or more rear wheel or track stations, and/or one or more rear wheels or tracks. \n\nAccordingly, the high speed amphibian may take the form of a motorcycle, tricycle or other configuration having a single front wheel or track station, and/or single front wheel or track. The amphibian can plane on water, yet has on-road, of f-road and utilitarian capability. Surprisingly, this new amphibian capability has been achieved without using additional movable flotation elements that extend from the hull while the amphibian is in the water. To this end, the applicant has gone against conventional thinking and overcome previous technical prejudices in arriving at the hull configuration according to the present invention.\n\nThe invention is not restricted to the illustrative video.

Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver who hopes to some day open his own limo company; one night behind the wheel begins promisingly when he picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), an attorney working with the federal government who is attractive, friendly, and gives him her business card after paying her fare. Max thinks his luck is getting even better when his next fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise), offers him several hundred dollars in cash if he'll be willing to drop him off, wait, and pick him up at five different spots over the course of the evening. Max agrees, but he soon realizes Vincent isn't just another guy with errands to run -- Vincent is an assassin who has been paid to murder five people who could put the leaders of a powerful drug trafficking ring behind bars in an upcoming trial. As circumstances force Max to do Vincent's bidding, the cabbie has to find a way to prevent Vincent from killing again and save his own skin, a task that becomes especially crucial when he discovers Annie is one of the names on Vincent's hit list.

The cane toad (originally from South America) was brought to Queensland, Australia by government bureaucrats (surprise, surprise) at the urging of the sugar cane industry. Instead of eating the beetles in the sugar cane, the cane toads ate everything else, and anything that ate them (goannas--large lizards, crocodiles, dogs, etc.) died, wiping out much of the large fauna across Australia. But now in an amazing turnaround, the people of Australia are fighting back, using copious amounts of beer and a twisted new sport: \"Cane Toad Muster.\" Led by the outback cowboys of the eastern Kimberley (Kimberley Toad Busters: http://www.canetoads.com.au), the cane toads are on the defensive. Will the cane toads prevail on eating all of Australia? Will the beer-swilling sports-rabid Aussies manage to make it off their sofas to battle back the cane toads? Stay tuned as this reality TV show involving an entire continent and at least 30 breweries unfolds.

Their affinity with people, and particularly children, is second to none and if there is a downside it's their constant eagerness to meet anyone or anything with a pulse.\n\n\"The public perception, perpetrated inaccurately by the media is that the Stafford is the 'Devil Dog'.\n\n\"The media likes nothing more than to link any attack on humans or animals with Staffords however tenuous or distorted that link is.\n\n\"The purpose of the website is to re-educate the media and rectify this misconceived public perception\". \n\n\"I want the Stafford to be portrayed in its true light which, as all Stafford owners will know, is far removed and contrary to the perception portrayed by the media.\" \n\nThe website, which aims to be fully comprehensive, features sections on the breed's history, caring for the Stafford, dogs and the law and other useful links.\n\nA Facebook page -- https://www.facebook.com/InDefenceOfTheStaffy has been designed for the Stafford owners to upload photos and videos of their pets, plus to share their many good new stories, and, in addition, a Twitter page - @staffydefence -- has also been created to promote the campaign. \n\nMr Freeman added: \"It is a truly sad indictment on the plight of this wonderful breed that myself and many others feel it necessary to create this type of website. \n\n\"The dog has attracted negative media attention for many years and is commonly associated with gangland drug-dealing thugs and attacks on people and other animals. \n\n\"I feel that there is so much within this breed that is good that hitherto has been artfully concealed from the public, which in turn, has created a massive problem for this loyal animal\n\n\"With new government legislation currently being mooted in conjunction with speculation that the Stafford should be outlawed as a \"Dangerous Dog\", the time to act is now.\" \n\nMr Freeman said that for far too long Stafford owners have been the silent majority and the time has now come for all Stafford owners to be more vociferous. \n\nThere are high-profile Stafford lovers who are actually embarrassed about their ownership of the Stafford, on the basis that it may be harmful for their professional reputation.\n\nIt is a tragic feature that approximately 80 per cent of all dogs in animal centres such as the Dogs Trust are either Stafford or Stafford crosses. \n\n\"I am a defence lawyer by trade and have been for over 30 years and www.savethestaffy.co.uk has been launched to communicate all that is great and good about the Stafford\n\n\"Until now there has been no real united front in defending them. As government legislation swiftly moves not only in the United Kingdom but also in other EU countries, I feel that it is imperative that the Stafford should be given a fair hearing.\n\n\"For example, the media are not interested in the fact that the Stafford is one of only two breeds that the Kennel Club specifically recommend as being suitable with children.\n\n\"We are not told they were used on a trial basis by the French Police but this was eventually given up because of their reluctance to inflict harm on human beings.\n\n\"We are not told of their heroics during the First World War when they were used to deliver messages and parcels in the trenches, and we are never told any of their amazing qualities which make them such a wonderful and versatile family pet.\n\n\"If we do not do something now and sit back and acquiesce in the demise of this breed, we will only have ourselves to blame for its ultimate extinction.\n\n\"This in turn will push ownership underground which will lead to the breed being used solely and exclusively for illegal purposes which will mark the end of time for the Stafford as we now know it.\"", "title": "Mr Loophole Represents Different Breed of Defendant!", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T11:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nRyYp8TYn0", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Expertvillage\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Expertvillage\n\nIn comedy terminology, a \"drawing room\" is a term that describes a very specific thing.

Finally it is Bottle Monday :-)\n\nThis time we are taking you to the beautiful city of Istanbul, where we just performed at a big festival. The morning after the concert we decided to make a really special video in a big bazaar, because of the great atmosphere. We wanted to play the Turkish song Simarik (which also has been translated to english at some point - here the song was named Kiss Kiss), because of its cool groove and because it allowed us to experiment even more with bending the bottles:-) \n\nWhen we got to the bazaar we asked some of the store owners if we could shoot a really short video next to them, but at first they totally refused, because they thought we were just some drunks with a lot of bottles :-D But when we demonstrated the concept, they definitely lightened up:-) \n\nIt was rather difficult to shoot the video because of all the people walking by us in this narrow place, and because we weren't allowed to use a tripod for the camera, so we had to ask a kind man to help us film it. The guards only allowed us to play it one time, so this definitely is a one shot!:-) \n\nNerd talk: We shot the video with a Canon 600D and recorded the sound using a Zoom H2N recorder standing on some spices to the right. \n\nWe really hope you will enjoy this video and that you will share it with your friends.:-D   \n\n\nLove from Bottle Boys!!\n\nFor more information and booking visit:\nhttp://thebottleboys.com | http://facebook.com/bottlesonly | http://twitter.com/thebottleboys | http://instagram.com/thebottleboys", "title": "Bottle Music in the Bazaar (Simarik)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T14:36:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nXepeuhjwA", "description": "Simon Whitehead gives his tips for raising working ferrets and shares his thoughts on the state of ferret breeding in the UK.", "title": "Shooting Times: Simon Whitehead on breeding ferrets", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T07:53:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nYMT-TWQLI", "description": "Japan - Immensity: Marvin M.

Im Altertum wurde diese Farnpflanze bei Milz- und Leberleiden angewandt. Im Mittelalter wurde der Farn als Mittel gegen offene Wunden sehr gesch\u00e4tzt.\n\nAuch heute noch benutzt man die Hirschzunge in der Naturheilkunde zur Behandlung dieser Erkrankungen. Die Hirschzunge ist, zusammen mit einer Reihe von anderen Wundkr\u00e4utern, im sogenannten Schweizertee enthalten.\n\nJe nach Standort und Alter wird der ausdauernde Hirschzungenfarn 20 bis 50 cm hoch. Die in b\u00fcschelform wachsenden, ungeteilten Bl\u00e4tter sind bogig \u00fcberh\u00e4ngend, lanzettlich und am Grund herzf\u00f6rmig. Der dicke Wurzelstock ist r\u00f6tlich gef\u00e4rbt. Der Geruch des getrockneten Hirschzungenfarns  ist aromatisch.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Hirschzungenfarn\n\nDie Hirschzunge w\u00e4chst fast im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Der Farn bevorzugt k\u00fchle, feuchte Schluchten, Kalkschutthalden, Felsspalten und altes Gem\u00e4uer. Man findet die Hirschzunge bis in H\u00f6henlagen von etwa 1800 m.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Hirschzunge\n\nadstringierend, f\u00f6rdert den Auswurf, entz\u00fcndungshemmend, reizlindernd, schleiml\u00f6send, harntreibend, hemmt die Milchsekretion, wundheilend\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von der Hirschzunge die frischen und getrockneten Bl\u00e4tter. Zur frischen Verwendung k\u00f6nnen die Bl\u00e4tter ganzj\u00e4hrig gesammelt werden. Bl\u00e4tter, die man zur Konservierung trocknen m\u00f6chte, sammelt man im September. Beachten Sie aber, das der Hirschzungenfarn in weiten Teilen Europas unter strengem Naturschutz steht. Hirschzungenfarne sind jedoch auch in Blumengesch\u00e4ften erh\u00e4ltlich. Die Farne sind beliebte Zimmerpflanzen.\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nWichtige Inhaltsstoffe dieser Heilpflanze sind: Schleimstoffe, Tannin, Vitamin C, Cholin, Kohlenhydrate\n\nDie Hirschzunge wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet.

Here, we describe fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ), in which stably cross-linked cDNA amplicons are sequenced within a biological sample. Using 30-base reads from 8742 genes in situ, we examined RNA expression and localization in human primary fibroblasts with a simulated wound-healing assay. FISSEQ is compatible with tissue sections and whole-mount embryos and reduces the limitations of optical resolution and noisy signals on single-molecule detection. Our platform enables massively parallel detection of genetic elements, including gene transcripts and molecular barcodes, and can be used to investigate cellular phenotype, gene regulation, and environment in situ.", "title": "Highly Multiplexed Subcellular RNA Sequencing in Situ", "publishedDate": "2014-03-02T15:08:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ngIv2hDoFQ", "description": "Off of the album \"Council Of The Dead\"\n\niTunes:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/council-of-the-dead/id905641312\nCD:  http://shop.invoguerecords.com\n\nI was a living soul just like the rest of you\nA normal guy working nine to five\nKeeping up with the bills because my mother was ill\nI lost track of time She lost her fucking mind\nEventually she died I was broken and petrified\nSo I drank the medicine tonight\nBottoms up here\u2019s to my shitty life\n\n(Chorus)\nWhere have all my morals gone?\nWashed away with the bottle\nHow did this all go wrong (It all went wrong)\nIt wasn\u2019t my intention but there\u2019s no redemption\nFor those who take away the lives of innocent\nI\u2019m inebriated, I\u2019m dangerous I can\u2019t (I can\u2019t live on)\nSo there\u2019s one in the chamber just waiting for me to end it all\n\nI drank my sorrows down and poisoned my soul to the core\nI drove away that dreadful night, couldn\u2019t take this life not anymore\nBehind the wheel, the tunnel vision, I couldn\u2019t see them\n85 through the intersection My sick transgression, I fucking killed him\nI saw the blood, what had I done?\n\n(Chorus)\n\nIt\u2019s come to this A pen and paper, a loaded gun\nI can\u2019t live on another day with everything that I\u2019ve done\nDark has taken all control\nThe accident had consequence, I took a father from his girl \nAnd god can\u2019t even save my soul\nThis life I live is barely living hollow man I have no feelings\nBurn in fires down below\nIt\u2019s just what I deserve cause I am evil and despicable\nOne shot ready to let go\nI put my finger on the trigger Life I want mine to be over\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThere\u2019s one in the chamber waiting for me just to end it all, end it all\nMy mother is gone, so I guess I\u2019ll just leave this for whoever finds me\nAll I can really say is I\u2019m sorry\nI can\u2019t live with myself for what I\u2019ve done\nI can\u2019t take the guilt, the pain, the emptiness\nIt\u2019s all just too much\nI\u2019m hollow I can\u2019t take life anymore", "title": "Famous Last Words - One In The Chamber", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T19:12:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nh-zhXu7PE", "description": "", "title": "Jamie Bower Campbell & Lily Collins Funny Moments", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T06:38:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nh4KUpg3uU", "description": "http://www.rebootcampretreat.com\nhttp://www.michaelandreula.com\n\nAbout\nCoconut\n\nCoconut palm (Cocos nucifera)\nScientific classification\nKingdom: Plantae\nClass: Monocots[1]\nOrder: Arecales\nSuborder: Commelinids\nFamily: Arecaceae\nSubfamily: Arecoideae\nTribe: Cocoeae\nGenus: Cocos\nSpecies: C. nucifera\nBinomial name\nCocos nucifera\nL.\nThe coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family). It is the only accepted species in the genus Cocos.[2] The term coconut can refer to the entire coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word.[3] The term is derived from 16th century Portuguese and Spanish coco, meaning \"head\" or \"skull\"[4], from the three small holes on the coconut shell that resemble human facial features, giving name to a bugbear.\nFound throughout the tropic and subtropic area, the coconut is known for its great versatility as seen in the many domestic, commercial, and industrial uses of its different parts. Coconuts are part of the daily diet of many people. Coconuts are different from any other fruits because they contain a large quantity of \"water\" and when immature they are known as tender-nuts or jelly-nuts and may be harvested for drinking. When mature they still contain some water and can be used as seednuts or processed to give oil from the kernel, charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk. The endosperm is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water. As development continues, cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the coconut, becoming the edible coconut \"flesh\".[5] When dried, the coconut flesh is called copra. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying; coconut oil is also widely used in soaps and cosmetics. The clear liquid coconut water within is a refreshing drink. The husks and leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating. It also has cultural and religious significance in many societies that use it.\nContents  [hide] \n1 Description\n2 Etymology\n3 Origin and distribution\n4 Natural habitat\n5 Cultivation\n6 Overview of uses\n7 Culinary use\n8 Commercial, industrial, and household use\n9 Role in culture and religion\n10 Medicinal uses\n11 Other uses\n12 Allergies\n13 See also\n14 References\n15 Further reading\n16 External links\n[edit]Description\n\n[edit]Plant\nCocos nucifera is a large palm, growing up to 30 meters (98 ft) tall, with pinnate leaves 4--6 meters (13--20 ft) long, and pinnae 60--90 cm long; old leaves break away cleanly, leaving the trunk smooth. Coconuts are generally classified into two general types: tall and dwarf.[6] On very fertile land, a tall coconut palm tree can yield up to 75 fruits per year, but more often yields less than 30 mainly due to poor cultural practices.[7] In recent years, improvements in cultivation practices and breeding has produced coconut trees that can yield more.[8][9]\n[edit]Fruit\nBotanically, the coconut fruit is a drupe, not a true nut.[10] Like other fruits, it has three layers: the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp. The exocarp and mesocarp make up the \"husk\" of the coconut. Coconuts sold in the shops of nontropical countries often have had the exocarp (outermost layer) removed. The mesocarp is composed of a fiber, called coir, which has many traditional and commercial uses. The shell has three germination pores (stoma) or \"eyes\" that are clearly visible on its outside surface once the husk is removed.\nA full-sized coconut weighs about 1.44 kilograms (3.2 lb). It takes around 6000 full-grown coconuts to produce a tonne of copra.[11]\n[edit]Roots\n This section requires expansion. (May 2012)\nUnlike some other plants, the palm tree has neither a tap root nor root hairs, but has a fibrous root system.[12]\nCoconut-inner edible solid part, raw (fresh kopra)\nNutritional value per 100 g (3.5 oz)\nEnergy 354 kcal (1,480 kJ)\nCarbohydrates 24.23\n- Sugars 6.23\n- Dietary fiber 9\nFat 33.49\nProtein 3.33 g\nWater 47\nThiamine (vit.

The extra bars and Xs seem to have no obvious purpose. Some have suggested that they might be hiding spots, sun shields, bird warnings or insect lures. Now a researcher at the University of Kyoto may have discovered the purpose of these designs. If he is right, evolutionary theory may be the victim of these spiders' webs.\n\nThe Asian spider the researcher studied builds two different types of webs. When it is well fed, this spider adds silk bands along the web spokes. However, when this spider is hungry, it arranges these bands so that they spiral toward the center of the web. After testing the tension in both web types, he discovered that the webs with the spiral bands are much more sensitive to even the smallest insect than the banded webs. \n\nIn other words, the hungry spider is looking for any insect it might eat. Spiders that are not hungry are interested only in larger insects. The question is: How could mindless evolution give these spiders the knowledge of structural engineering needed to create these designs? In addition, according to the evolutionary tree for spiders, this knowledge would have to have evolved at least nine times! A much more logical and straightforward explanation is that the Creator gave spiders this knowledge when He made them.\n\nPrayer: Help me, Lord, to do all things excellently, as You have done.

The past year or should I say 6 years have been like a dream and a movie, The events surrounding the nights of 6/7/13, hmmm 6+7=13 & 6/8/13 was a closing scene. Why do I keep seeing the numerological omens 13, 33,7, 3, 9, 11 12? I know about Pythagorous and master numbers. Why when I came in to jail ,and the guards and I got into a situation resulting in me being assaulted, was I then spoken to by the corporal about why I'm discussing a c.i.a/nsa conspiracy? He first had me stand so he could quietly tell me by my ear that he could kill me right then if he wanted to then sat down and said they're trying to help me. Really? why? because I already have a pending accident lawsuit and you gotta cover up your shit? Who was the crazy killer who looked posessed in medical cell 511. His name was Joseph McAndrews Jr. and he was to the left of me , as I'm in between him and another killer in 513. Why did he call me over to his plexiglass covered cell door saying to me \"New Deal, a trip to Hawaii and a lot of money\", negative homie. Weird my bday is 5/12. so its 511, 5/12, 513. I was released in 5 months and 5 days  on 11/13/13. Weird 511, 513, 5 months 5 days, 11/13, by taking the first number of each cell number and the last numbers of the cell numbers and put them together. The same day I left the county he left for the state psych institute which is also ironic. He then elaborates throughout the day saying \"if your chosen down the line your initiation will be a hard one\" and \"you'll have to lose that if you want to save the world\" as he eyes up my walker. He claimed my son's name on my back, Marcus Moses, is the only reason I'll be kept alive during the apocalypse because I'm not fully caucasion as he nodded towards an Irish man signifying he would be kept alive during the apocalypse. He also He also suggested I was being a bitch about something which I intuitively felt he was talking about the incident that brought me there or other instances in my life where I decided to walk away from certain situations instead of goin all in on some gangsta shit lol I told him it was self preservation. When I returned to the block off medical the dude across from me in bed 33 ones night is sleeping with his hand over his eye like he's looking through a telescope like me in the picture on fb. Why during the fight back at my boys house I ran out of did I feel an electromagnetic sensation enter the back of by neck/skull area and it feel like my body involuntarily hunched over the tub and inverted upside down before i dropped back to the floor? I've heard about mind control, MK ULTRA, and electromagnetic harassment and gangstalking and the m.o. is looking earily similar.  Why me? Is it my revolutionary circle, my media connects and my outspokenness? Why did my boy hide my bag with the rest of my clothes, weapons and personal effects? why was the cd player on the floor open like it was the night before when I was there and in the same place? why did my boy disappear the night before and we found him behind the post office? Why did he tell me he got raped because of me and say he doesn't know who iI pissed of but I'm bringing him heat. I also heard he had sexual relations for years with an undercover cop and that he's a c.i.?  i have so many other deeper questions surrounding these events. 6 months ago I got set up to look like I went crazy off wet on some 'smokie' from Friday shit, swung on a persuing gunman, got chased and beat down at gunpoint, batoned, pistol whipped and stabbed by the gunman and his son. I was arrested and taken to the hospital treated like I was resistant and irrational. I got stitched up, demanded them to unlock the straps on my bed and refused overnight treatment because for the 3rd time they're lieing saying I have no broken bones. I went to the police station thinking I'll take my charges and go home. After reading the affidavit full of lies and ommisions by the plaintiffs, backed by witnesses who refused to provide their info to the police, I was sure that there was some much deeper shit going on. The past 6 years have been a crazy ride. I've opened for hip hop legends and met industry leaders and artists. My college homies work for leaders in corporate media and worked worked with superstars. I'm a regional small business networker and I'm back to centeringwith God, my blueprint, my personal legend, my music and the one who appreciates me the most...M.E.  I was handed jewels this time inside by some new divinely inspired comrades.

By Dr. Christopher Segler, a foot surgeon in San Francisco. The location of the ganglion within your foot has a lot to do with how likely it is that you will have to have surgery to remove the ganglion. The most common location for a ganglion cyst in the foot is actually in the top of the foot as seen here in the midfoot. But ganglion cyst can also happen at the ankle joint as you see here. The big toe joint is another common location for a ganglion. Some patients will even get a ganglion cyst at two locations at once as you can see here at the big toe joint and the little toe joint on the top of the foot. But not all of these ganglion's will need surgery and will talk about which ones need surgery and why.\n\nThere are really three reasons that a ganglion cyst will need surgery. The first reason is that the ganglion is painful. The second reason is that the ganglion cyst is so big that it can make it difficult to wear shoes. And the third reason is that the ganglion cyst is pushing on a nerve and it can actually cause permanent nerve damage.\n\nThis ganglion cyst has been rubbing inside a shoe and the skin is red and irritated. Once a ganglion cyst in the foot becomes painful, it may be necessary to have ganglion surgery to remove it. Burning, tingling and numbness in the foot are all signs that the ganglion cyst is pushing directly on a nerve. The red line shows the course of the proper digital nerve that goes out to the big toe. The ganglion is clearly right in the way, compressing the nerve. When a ganglion compresses one of the nerves in the foot, surgery may be necessary to prevent nerve damage, permanent numbness, or chronic pain. \n\nThis picture was taken just before surgery to remove the ganglion on the top if the foot was pushing on a nerve causing tingling and burning pain when ever she wore shoes. When you look at the foot from the side you can imaging how the shoes push down on then ganglion and pinch the nerve that is between the bump and the shoe.\n\nBut again, not all ganglions need to be removed. This is a large ganglion in the ankle and there is a nerve under there, but the nerve is so deep that the ganglion is not actually pushing on the nerve and the its causing no pain in the foot and no tingling in the foot at all. The other fortunate thing about this ganglion is that is high enough in the ankle that the shoes don't even push against it. So even though you can see it sticking out its not getting irritated at all. \n\nThis patient actually has two ganglion cysts on the top of the foot. But if you look you can see where those ganglions are rubbing against this one particular shoe when she dances. She can still run without pain and she is not having any numbness or tingling. So as long as she can find a pair of shoes to dance in that will no rub on the ganglions and cause discomfort, she should not have to have surgery in order to remove the ganglions.\n\nReasons to consider surgery for a ganglion in the foot is if it is painful, you are having burning or tingling sensations, or if the ganglion is too big to fit into shoes, or if we drain it and the ganglion comes back. If you think you have a ganglion cyst in the foot and you are unsure about whether or not you think it will need surgery, you can call and speak directly to a ganglion expert to determine whether or not ganglion surgery is necessary for you.

Because carotid stenting is minimally invasive, it provides an excellent treatment option to patients who are high-risk candidates for endarterectomy surgery. The procedure requires only a local anesthetic and a tiny puncture into an artery in the groin area, rather than opening the artery in the neck. The blockage is treated with balloon angioplasty and the placement of a stent - a small, self-expanding metal tube or 'scaffold' that keeps the vessel open, thereby preventing a stroke from occurring. A tiny umbrella-like filter is used to catch and remove loose pieces of plaque that develop during the stenting procedure before they travel to the brain and create a stroke.\n\nX-ray studies using special dyes, called carotid angiograms, can show the degree of blockage of the carotid arteries. Other tests such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can visualize blockages in the carotid arteries.\n\nPrior to carotid stenting, blockages in the carotid artery were treated with a surgical procedure called carotid endarterectomy, in which surgeons made an incision in the neck artery to remove the plaque and diseased artery.\n\nCarotid artery stenting is the only FDA approved system currently available for the prevention of stroke for patients who are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy. Patients who receive a carotid stent usually leave the hospital one or two days after the procedure. \n\nCarotid Endarterectomy is an operation during which your vascular surgeon removes the inner lining of your carotid artery if it has become thickened or damaged. This procedure eliminates a substance called plaque from your artery and can restore blood flow.\n\nAs you age, plaque can build up in the walls of your arteries. Cholesterol, calcium, and fibrous tissue make up this plaque. As more plaque builds up, your arteries narrow and stiffen. This process is called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Eventually, enough plaque builds up to reduce blood flow through your carotid arteries, or cause irregularities in the normally smooth inner walls of the arteries.\n\nYour carotid arteries are located on each side of your neck and extend from your aorta in your chest to the base of your skull. These important arteries supply blood to your brain.\n\nCarotid artery disease is a serious issue because clots can form on the plaque. Plaque or clots can also break loose and travel to the brain. If a clot or plaque blocks the blood flow to your brain sufficiently, it can cause an ischemic stroke, which can cause permanent brain damage, or death, if a large enough area of the brain is affected. If a clot or plaque blocks only a tiny artery in the brain, it may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke.  A TIA is often a warning sign that a stroke may occur in the near future, and it should be a signal to seek treatment before a stroke occurs.\n\nTo remove plaque in your carotid arteries and help prevent a stroke, your physician may recommend a carotid endarterectomy. Carotid endarterectomy is one of the most commonly performed vascular operations, and is a safe and long-lasting treatment.", "title": "Carotid Stenting Endarterectomy", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T16:32:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nyWWD1w0bo", "description": "Kristofer F\u00f6rs\u00e4ter shows Leptodactylus fallax at Norden's Ark, Sweden, for frogblogmanchester.", "title": "Leptodactylus fallax at Nordens Ark, Sweden", "publishedDate": "2010-08-25T10:42:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6nyi76_SRYo", "description": "YUG feat SoJay - Doin' [44th & Filth]\nMixes: YUG Remix, Dzeko & Torres What Are We Remix, Dzeko & Torres What Are We Dub, mUSER's Sundown Mix, Original Club Mix, Original Dub Mix \nRelease Date: May 3, 2011 - Exclusive to Beatport, May 31, 2011 - Worldwide.\nhttp://44thandfilth.com/\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n@ Beatport \u00bb http://beatport.com/s/t7Sfuf\n@ iTunes \u00bb http://bit.ly/fff012it\n@ NowTrax \u00bb http://bit.ly/kvS392\n@ Juno \u00bb http://bit.ly/fff012jd\n@ DJ Download \u00bb http://bit.ly/fff012djd\n\nPREVIEW NOW\nhttp://www.44thandfilth.com/music/fff012.php\n\nYUG unleashes more of his vocal dominance, with a hot new find SoJay, in a soulful progressive house joint Doin'.\n\nThe Original Club Mix showcases the effortless, sultry tones over gorgeous chords and a weaving arp, creating a rich, warm atmosphere.
