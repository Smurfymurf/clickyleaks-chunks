Moore, Joseph L. Galloway, Randall Wallace\nFilm Description: Screenwriter Randall Wallace, a specialist in sweeping historical epics, steps behind the camera for this fact-based Vietnam War drama that reunites him with his Braveheart (1995) star Mel Gibson. Gibson is Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the \"The Valley of Death.\" Moore soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall (Greg Kinnear), and Lt. Henry Herrick (Marc Blucas) refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. The film co-stars Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein, Keri Russell, and Sam Elliott. We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (retired) and UPI reporter Joe Galloway (played in the film by Barry Pepper).\n\n\"we were soldiers\",\"we were soldiers clip\",\"we were soldiers soundtrack\",\"we were soldiers part 1\",\"mel gibson\",\"barry pepper\",\"gun videos\",\"machine gun videos\",drama,\"military war dramas\",\"military action adventure\",\"stephen mceveety\",\"jim lemley\",\"eveleen bandy\",\"randall wallace\",\"bruce davey\",\"danielle lemmon zapotoczny\",\"stephen zapotoczny\",\"william hoy\",\"violence videos\",\"war videos\",\"war zone videos\",\"lt col hal moore\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++259501,/m/0c1pj,/m/04m064", "title": "We Were Soldiers (7/9) Movie CLIP - Napalm Air Strike (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-02-25T07:28:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8T79UwSUgAg", "description": "A quick look at the history of how your wardrobe was invented.

Every football player, whether a lineman or defensive back, requires good footwork and that is why we put a huge emphasis on agility ladder drills and mini hurdles.  These training tools increase your ability to develop fast twitch muscles.  \n\nLeg strength can be built over time through weight and sprint training. Cone drills can improve your leg strength and explosion with the load you put into a turn.  By sprinting full speed and having to suddenly stop, you put great force on your legs.  \n\nMini hurdles provide a great deal of leg cycle / turnover training.  You are forced to bring your heal up, around and down to sprint through the hurdles.  This training will increase your stride frequency and improve your foot contact.  \n\nThe OverSpeed bungee / cable adds resistance training to every drill you already do.  As you improve your technique, add the bungee / cable and see your results increase.\n\nSome brief training methodology:\n\nSPEED\nMechanics produce efficiency; efficiency produces speed. There is no answer for speed except more speed. Speed can be taught. It is not just a matter of running excessively or sprinting random distances; it is mechanics and techniques applied to specific training distances and suitable drills. With our high-speed training philosophy, we never train slowly. This is not the same as the Warm Up or letting an athlete slow down to learn a drill, like on the ladder. However, during speed training, all reps should be performed at a high speed. By training fast, you get fast.\n\nCHANGE OF DIRECTION\nChange of direction can be the most valuable tool coaches have at their disposal. Change of direction requires speed, strength and conditioning. It is the most stressful training event on the legs. It involves moving at a high rate of speed, followed by powerful muscle contractions in order to stop and make the change of direction, followed by the explosiveness required to return to a high rate of speed. This sequence over and over again results in the physically demanding nature of change of direction. We utilize it as a key element in conditioning. \n\nCONDITIONING\nConditioning is the product of duration and intensity of training. The more RPMs a heart can sustain for longer periods, the better the conditioning. Conditioning sessions are manipulated much like strength training variables -- a matter of anaerobic versus aerobic. In training, it is beneficial to expose the athlete to conditioning relative to their sport(s). Every sport has its \"shape.\" \"Football shape\" differs from \"soccer shape\" which differs from \"softball shape\" which differs from \"basketball shape.\" However, most athletic events occur over a period of hours and at varying speeds, so all athletes should have an appropriate balance of both anaerobic and aerobic conditioning. In our program, some conditioning days are anaerobic, creating a faster heart rate. Others are aerobic, which allows the body to absorb the training.", "title": "SINGLE LEG SHUFFLE - AGILITY LADDER - FOOTWORK, QUICKNESS & SPEED TRAINING DRILLS", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T19:06:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8TR6tsTDk8E", "description": "Daniel, Anita, Joey, Andrew, Dalin, Nathan, Dominick, Jessica", "title": "Dermatome dance purple class AUSTIN", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T01:24:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8TRG3hM6SWg", "description": "GALPON \"HERMANOS QUIJADA\" PRIMER TOPE DE POLLONES, LINEA AMERICANOS HELICOPTERO.

We play \"for us' without settling of limits in our way of evolving. How does one understand the power of a band pushing a genre that receives little to no credit by the mainstream media? How does one gauge the implication of a band which tour almost never in the past? Since the beginning, the main objective hasn't changed: play fast, play hard without caring besides and never focused on success. Music, it's all that we have... and for this understanding, we have the best fans in the world.\n\nThis year (2010) Forus recruited the talent of Bastien Lamarque (guitar), now entirely integrated beside Michel Garcia (vocals and guitar) and R\u00e9mi Lafargue (drums), the only two originals members.

'Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.' (Rom 10:1-2) It is not my goal to condemn the Jewish people, but to condemn the six-pointed star, a curse symbol. The hexagram star was mentioned and condemned by the God of Israel in Amos 5:26 and it was called by Him, `the star of your god, Moloch' or otherwise called `Chiun'. Reference was also made to the Israelites having it in the wilderness in Acts 7:43 by Stephen. Here it was called the Star of Remphan. All these names refer to the `god' Saturn. Now, the name SATURN in Chaldee is pronounced Satur; but, as every Chaldee scholar knows, consists only of four letters, thus -- Stur [ed. Star?]. This name contains exactly the Apocalyptic number.' (Hislop, p. 269) S = 060 T = 400 U = 006 R = 200: = 666 Now Saturn is also the sixth Planet from the Sun, has six letters and Saturn is associated with Satan which has a very similar spelling.http://www.av1611.org/nkjv.html", "title": "First Pentacle Of Saturn", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T22:43:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8TyEhu85HYw", "description": "BKR10 Becker Crewman No\u017ee N\u016f\u017e Knife Knives", "title": "BKR10 Becker Crewman", "publishedDate": "2013-08-14T17:43:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Typj7HVPAk", "description": "Gri - G\u00fcnah \u015eehri\n\nWebsites\nWebsite \u00b7 www.griyiz.com\nFacebook \u00b7 www.facebook.com/officialgri\nTwitter \u00b7 www.twitter.com/grimusic\nMenajerlik - Ece Filiz Gorgulu \u00b7 05323681148\nGri\n\nSerhat Erman, Berkan Tomay, Ibrahim Kent ve Murat \u015eahin taraf\u0131ndan Mart 2013'de Istanbul'da kuruldu.

The Bennets (Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland) are the parents of five daughters near the close of the 18th century. Comfortable within their means but well short of rich, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are looking for suitable husbands for their girls, and they are encouraged to learn that an eligible young bachelor from a wealthy family, Charles Bingley (Simon Woods), has moved into a nearby estate. Eager to see if a match can be made, the Bennets bring their daughters Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Jane (Rosamund Pike) to a ball thrown by their new neighbor to see if sparks will fly. Jane seems to like Charles, and he appears to feel the same, but Elizabeth takes an immediate dislike to Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), Charles' egocentric best friend. While Elizabeth is infatuated with military man Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend) and finds herself courted by William Collins (Tom Hollander), a well-meaning but drab man of the cloth, fate causes Elizabeth and Darcy to frequently cross paths, and while they don't care for one another, they can't stop thinking about each other, either. Pride & Prejudice also stars Jena Malone, Judi Dench, and Penelope Wilton.\n\n\"pride & prejudice\",\"pride & prejudice clip\",\"pride & prejudice 2005\",\"pride & prejudice 1995\",\"keira knightley\",\"matthew macfadyen\",\"joe wright\",\"letter videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",romance,\"eric fellner\",\"liza chasin\",\"debra hayward\",\"paul webster\",\"jane frazer\",\"accountability videos\",\"choice videos\",\"honor videos\",\"respect videos\",\"truth videos\",\"understanding videos\",\"england videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++309976,/m/03rnz7,/m/01l2fn", "title": "Pride & Prejudice (7/10) Movie CLIP - A Letter to Elizabeth (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T15:36:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8U58TyxqnxE", "description": "http://www.capitolnewsonline.com | http://www.capitolnewsgy.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/wrhmnews\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CapitolNewsGY", "title": "Police Blotter", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T00:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8U5KRVfYUFE", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nBack to the Future Deleted Scene - Peanut Brittle (1985) - Michael J.

In my case I needed to film a six page commercial for the FroKnowsPhoto Guide To DSLR Video and there was no way I could memorize the script. \n\nThe only way I would be able to make sure I hit all the keywords I wanted to was to pick up a teleprompter.  I honestly have never used one before, all of my videos are straight off the top of my head. \n\nBecause this was for a sales video where the wording was extremely important I knew I had to attempt to use the teleprompter or I would never be able to complete the video. \n\nI did a quick search around the internet to see what I should purchase and I ended up with this Telmax Galaxy Series Pro iP Ex iPad Teleprompter for $449.  \n\nPlease Subscribe http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=jaredpolin\nTo connect with FroKnowsPhoto please follow below\nhttp://froknowsphoto.com/flashguide/ Check out the FroKnowsPhoto Flash Guide.\nhttp://froknowsphoto.com/fro-video-gu...

Note - since getting to Cannon Beach, we've decided to start the walk from the coast here.\n\n------\nWhat are you willing to do for freedom?\n\nVote? Protest? Participate in a rally? Walk all the way across the country?\n\nWe are.\n\nThis summer, a group of activists will be walking across America to achieve more freedom and liberty.\n\nOur pioneer forefathers trekked across the continent from the east to the west to find a better life for themselves. This time, we're doing it in reverse.\n \nStarting April 12, I will be walking coast-to-coast across the country, from Oregon to New Hampshire. I will be joined by my immediate family as well. We're on a quest to gain more freedom for ourselves and for our country by spreading the message of freedom and liberty along the way.\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nWe see the gradual chipping away at freedoms in America, and want to do our part to stop it. My wife and I are moving to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project. New Hampshire is already the freest state in the country, which is why we are moving there. But we also want to help bring more freedom to as many other people as possible.\n\nTherefore we are walking across America to get to New Hampshire. We are walking all the way there to bring as much media attention and publicity as possible to two liberty-oriented causes: the Free State Project, which is working to make New Hampshire even more free, and Ron Paul's message of freedom for everyone. To learn more about the Free State Project, visit http://freestateproject.org To learn more about Ron Paul, visit http://ronpaul2008.com\n\nFollow Our Progress\n\nRead my blog at http://willbuchanan.com/blog to learn more about the latest in our preparations for the Walk For Liberty and our progress and adventures during it. You may also subscribe to it at http://willbuchanan.com/blog/feed\n\nHow you can help\n\nPlease visit http://walkforliberty.com/help-out if you'd like to help the Walk For Liberty achieve more freedom for everyone.\n\nDonate\n\nWould you consider donating $3 to help support the Walk For Liberty? Even the price of a cup of coffee will go a long way to helping pay for our mission to promote liberty. No donation is too small!

As the flight land down to the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport.\n\nAssam is a state of India in the north-eastern region. Its capital Dispur, is located within the municipal area of Guwahati city. Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra and the Barak river valleys along with the Karbi Anglong and the North Cachar Hills.  Assam is surrounded by six of the other Seven Sister States: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya. Geographically Assam and these states are connected to the rest of India via a narrow strip of land in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or \"Chicken's Neck\".\n\nAssam shares international borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh; as well as cultures, peoples and climate with South-East Asia -- important elements in India's Look East policy. Assam became a part of the British India after the British occupied the region following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824--1826.\n\nAssam is rich in culture, ethnic groups, languages/dialects spoken and literature. It is known for Assam tea, large and old petroleum resources (the first oil reserves of India were discovered in Assam in the late 19th century), Assam silk and for its rich biodiversity. Assam has successfully conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the tiger and numerous species of birds, and it provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. It is becoming an increasingly popular destination for wildlife tourism, and Kaziranga and Manas are both World Heritage Sites.Assam was also known for its Sal tree forests and forest products, of which much is depleted now. A land of high rainfall, Assam is endowed with lush greenery and the mighty river Brahmaputra.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Lorsqu'elle avait 17 ans Nabilla Benattia a fait un mois de prison pour escroquerie. Aujourd'hui, elle risque entre 5 et 7 ans de prison pour avoir poignard\u00e9 son petit ami Thomas Vergara. Retour sur un casier judiciaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien fourni.\nUne erreur, \u00e7a arrive. Un acc\u00e8s de col\u00e8re aussi. Dans le couple de Nabilla et Thomas, il semble que la violence rythmait leur quotidien. La case prison, Nabilla Benattia connait d\u00e9j\u00e0. La bimbo de All\u00f4 Nabilla a en effet un casier judiciaire fourni. Si nous l'avons connue sur nos \u00e9crans de t\u00e9l\u00e9 en 2011 dans L'Amour est aveugle 2, les services de police, eux, la connaissait depuis 2009. A cette \u00e9poque, Nabilla Benattia a purg\u00e9 un mois de prison ferme, selon nos confr\u00e8res du magazine Le Point pour escroquerie, \u00e0 la prison pour mineurs de La Clairi\u00e8re \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve. Elle n'avait que 17 ans.\n\nUn mois de d\u00e9tention pour escroquerie\n----------------------------------------------------\nElle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inculp\u00e9e avec cinq autre personnes. \"Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue responsable de l'ouverture de comptes bancaires \u00e0 l'aide d'un passeport vol\u00e9\", \u00e9crivent les journalistes du Point. Sur le plateau du Suppl\u00e9ment de Ma\u00eftena Biraben, Nabilla reconna\u00eet ses erreurs mais les minimise. \"J'ai fait de la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Mais c'est pas de la prison, c'est de la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Tout le monde fait des erreurs\".\n\nDans une interview au Point accord\u00e9e le 22 octobre, elle revenait sur cette erreur de jeunesse. \"Mon casier judiciaire est connu, en particulier gr\u00e2ce au Point. Au d\u00e9but, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 dur, mais maintenant je m'en fous. Les gens m'ont tout pardonn\u00e9. Quand on fait des erreurs de jeunesse, on ne peut pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 toute sa vie. M\u00eame si on tue des gens ou que l'on fait des choses gravissimes. On est tous des \u00eatres humains, on a droit \u00e0 l'erreur. Il faut payer sa peine, et une fois que la peine a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, on ne peut pas vous p\u00e9naliser toute une vie.\"\n\nDes chambres d'h\u00f4tel saccag\u00e9es\n---------------------------------------------\nPar la suite, la jeune femme n'est pas repass\u00e9e par la case prison avant cette nuit. Sur les coups de 2h30 du matin, elle aurait poignard\u00e9 son compagnon Thomas Vergara dans une chambre d'h\u00f4tel de l'\u00eele Seguin \u00e0 Boulogne-Billancourt. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e en garde \u00e0 vue et transf\u00e9r\u00e9e au si\u00e8ge de la police judiciaire de Nanterre.\n\nBien que Thomas Vergara ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas porter plainte, la jeune femme risque tr\u00e8s gros. Bien plus que le mois de prison qu'elle a fait dans sa jeunesse. Un avocat au barreau de Paris a indiqu\u00e9 sur son compte Twitter, qu'en \"mati\u00e8re de violences comme pour 99% des d\u00e9lits, la plainte de la victime n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire\". Nabilla risquerait donc une peine allant de 5 ans \u00e0 7 ans de prison, et ce selon la gravit\u00e9 des blessures. Ce n'est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que nous entendons parler de violence dans leur couple.\n\nUn guichetier de la SNCF agress\u00e9\n----------------------------------------------\nEn 2013, les deux amants terribles ont fait parler d'eux en saccageant deux chambres d'h\u00f4tel. La premi\u00e8re bagarre a eu lieu au Blanc-Mesnil. Thomas Vergara a d\u00e9fonc\u00e9 la porte de la salle de bain et bris\u00e9 le lavabo. Quatre mois plus tard, ils remettent \u00e7a dans une chambre d'h\u00f4tel de Marseille. Ecran plasma fractur\u00e9, cigarettes \u00e9cras\u00e9es au sol, le montant des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 1.200 euros. Un an plus tard, le 18 mai 2014, alors qu'elle est attendue au festival de Cannes, Nabilla est interpell\u00e9e par les forces de l'ordre pour avoir crach\u00e9 sur un guichetier de la SNCF.

This disorder is only diagnosed when these behaviors become persistent and very disabling or distressing\n\nPoliticians  with this disorder are generally difficult to get along with and often have problems with close relationships because of their excessive suspiciousness and hostility.  They  will avoid interviews with Fox News . Their combative and suspicious nature may elicit a hostile response in others, which then serves to confirm their original expectations. Individuals with this disorder have a need to have a high degree of control over those around them.  These politicans  known as  (Algorites) will go to the extent of creating movies to attempt to prove there beliefs rather than granting interviews where their beleifs can be questioned and cross examined..

Doctors created a hole in Emily's throat and inserted a tube leading directly to her trachea.\n\nAlthough she has had a few setbacks in recovery, Emily began to breathe on her own Thursday and was taken off a ventilator.\n\nThomas said it's been gut wrenching to see her daughter cry now silent tears.\n\n\"You don't hear it and that really upsets me,\" she said. \"I feel like I can't leave the room.

Because it's a great match for a raised-9 chord. Check the notation to get acquainted with the scale if you don't know it already. It's easier to memorize than most scales because it's built on a steady pattern of 1/2 step, whole step, 1/2 step, whole step. \n\nGet the diminished scale into your \"ears\" before worrying about how to get it under your fingers. One very effective way to do that (with any scale, really) is to take just a few notes at a time. Choose a small subset of the diminished scale and improvise over the raised-9 chord. \n\nThe diminished scale also works beautifully with a blues scale. One way to bring them together is to start a line in the blues scale, and then bring in notes from the diminished. Listen to how those \"diminished\" notes break the boundaries of the blues sound resulting in very interesting lines for the listener.", "title": "Larry Carlton - 335 Improv - The Diminished Scale - Blues Guitar Lessons", "publishedDate": "2009-11-19T22:53:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8V9FQFYgx-A", "description": "Trying out a walk cycle for the footman.

Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Eight genera and 26 species are currently recognized.\nMost members of this family are ambush predators, in that they typically remain motionless in a camouflaged position and then strike suddenly at passing prey. They will generally not attack humans unless startled or provoked, although females protecting their eggs can be aggressive. Reports of attacks on human beings were once more common in South and Southeast Asia, but are now quite rare.\n\nCobra:\nIt seems unfairly menacing that a snake that can literally \"stand up\" and look a full-grown person in the eye would also be among the most venomous on the planet, but that describes the famous king cobra.\n\nKing cobras can reach 18 feet (5.5 meters) in length, making them the longest of all venomous snakes. When confronted, they can raise up to one-third of their bodies straight off the ground and still move forward to attack. They will also flare out their iconic hoods and emit a bone-chilling hiss that sounds almost like a growling dog.\n\nLion vs Hippo - Lion's Jaw is Breaking Off \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExZYbraxYp0,\n\nThe Best Cobra vs Mongoose Fights #HD \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AUu56L5-jQ\n\nJaguar vs Python #HD\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt-QQBss3QA\n\nLion Kill a Baboon #HD\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDtk8AJHqZs\n\nShark vs Python #HD \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovv277glfOI\n\nLeopard Attacks Crocodile - Great Ambush\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBnD0nPZiaE\n\nElephant Kill a Lion #HD\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHLWdHetROI\n\n5 Lions Attack 1 Buffalo | Lion vs Buffalo 2014 \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhBIyX9KsA\n\nTiger Kill a Brother [HD]\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY0j44kXcZY\n\nBoar vs Tiger | Tiger Attack #HD\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrPEkYcYFxY\n\nLion vs Elephant \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DITfX0o31Pw\n\nGiraffe vs Lion | ANIMAL ATTACK \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvcNxnBlBWA\n\n\nGoogle Plus\nhttps://plus.google.com/+Wildattacksvideo\n\nSubscribe\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/wildattacks", "title": "Cobra vs Python - Python Eats Cobra", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T23:17:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8VB9rVA7_RU", "description": "February 13, 2012 - James Mercer of The Shins with \"Young Pilgrams\" in the Bing Lounge at 101.9 KINK.FM.

The United States has made money its God.  Ours is a society whose mass educational system turns out outer-directed automatons.  Our government has become an oligarchy, a government of the few, by the few, for the few.  Our corporate media participates in the dumbing down of our people and generates propaganda that supports the narratives of our Power Elites instead of the information the people would need to make intelligent decisions.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that out of our very sick country who thinks continuous war is normal, who dismisses the death of human beings as collateral damage, a very primitive behavior has emerged - Government Gang Stalking.\n\nUnderstanding What Makes Gang Stalkers Tick\n\nHow can Government Gang Stalkers Be So Cruel, so indifferent to the suffering of their targets?\n\nHow can they Gang Stalk their targets 24/7 for years?\n\nIs the answer that the Government Gang Stalkers have a Narcissistic Personality Disorder?\n\n\n\nThis would explain:\n\"their inflated sense of self-importance\"\ntheir belief \"they are superior to others\"\ntheir lack of regard for the feelings of others\n\"their antisocial behavior\"\ntheir belief they have a right to Gang Stalk because they are better than their targets\nthe power trip they are on\ntheir belief they are special\ntheir lack of acknowledgement of their target's feelings and emotions\ntheir distain for their targets\ntheir jealousy that often starts Gang Stalking\ntheir fragile sense of self-esteem that initially makes them target others in Gang Stalking\nputting themselves on a pedestal high above others/their targets\nwhy they look down on people/belittle targets\ntheir feeling they are entitled to Gang Stalk\ntheir self-image of power and perfection\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/basics/definition/con-20025568\nIs the only way to Stop Government Gang Stalking to give mental treatment to those who do it?\nhttp://www.officer.com/article/10248968/the-malignant-narcissist\nUp to 6.2% of our population has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder\nhttp://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder In Relation To Gang Stalking\nhttp://worldvictimsofstalkingsupportunion.webs.com/apps/blog/show/26008045-narcissistic-personality-disorders-in-relation-to-gang-stalking\n\nYou can see all my videos on you tube:\n\nwww.youtube.com/user/bonnieleec\n\nIt has become clear to me that the Sick Phenomena of Government Gang Stalking is a symptom of a very sick and unconscious society. \n\nVideos showing what a Sane America would look like can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheLeftLibertarian/videos.\n\nYou can visit my website that discusses how to Restore the Rule of Law in California here: http://www.fascisminamerica.com.\nYou can visit my website - A Whole New Paradigm - here:http://www.wholenewparadigm.com.", "title": "6.

We have a heat gun, a heat gun is not the same as a blow dryer. This has a little more horse power. You have to be careful with it. The other way is a chemical stripper. They both have their pro's and con's. \n\nA heat gun is kind of like ironing. You want to be methodical and not hold it in one place too long. The heat, will loosen up the layers of paint and you can scrape it off. The plus point is you don't have to inhale to the chemicals from a chemical stripper. \n\nAlright, so were going to do a section here for you. Show you the heat gun. [background noise] Pretty soon you will see it start to bubble...It is okay to use this on wood, but, be methodical about it and be careful. Were going to see whole layers of paint come off...It is good to do just a section at a time...This is not a fast process...Wow look at that...So plan your weekend accordingly and always use safety measures, long sleeves and gloves...So it may not be fast but this is an efficient way to strip paint if you are very careful.", "title": "How to Strip Paint Using a Heat Gun | House Painting", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T20:32:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8VIZnI9MCqc", "description": "Watch clips from WOLF OF WALL STREET: http://goo.gl/310pPy\n\nSubscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Ultimate Money Trailer (2013) Leonardo DiCaprio Movie HD\n\nThe story of a New York stockbroker, played by DiCaprio, who refuses to cooperate in a large securities fraud case involving corruption on Wall Street, the corporate banking world and mob infiltration.\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

Will post them over next two days. These trees originated in Central America and I have known them locally all my life. I enjoyed their small leave foliage and have grown one in the past (wife not so happy with the thorns). I have not previously recognised them as a source of food for birds. These past two weeks the two trees on the road at the back of our home have been fruiting very well, possibly a result of our intense dry spell. Many birds congregate to feed on the fruit -- not the easiest fruit to get access to. The fruit is encased in hanging coiled pods, the ripe ones may burst open (said to be edible for man). The birds have to hang upside down and peck at it to open the pod. They either are able to get small bites or more often large chunks (see images). \nA Ficus benjamina is also fruiting extensively about 40 meters away but hardly any birds found there this period. All are busy at the Madras Thorn. It is possible a choice based on the \"taste\" of the fruit. The flesh of the Madras Thorn fruit is usually astringent but some varieties are sweet.\n\nBird directly observed to feed on fruit:\n1. Yellow Vented Bulbul Pycnonotus goiavier analis -- more than 8 at a time; may swallow large chunks of fruit; seen taking food away to nesting young.\n2. Asian Glossy Starling Aplonis panayensis strigata -- large numbers, in excess of 30. Mixture of juveniles and adult actively feeding.\n3. Black-naped Oriole Oriolus chinensis maculates -- more than 6 at a time, with a mixture of young and mature adults feeding higher in the canopy. Harder to approach for images.\n4. Lineated Barbet Megalaima lineata hodgsoni -- unsure about numbers, possibly two, seen only once feeding on fruit.\n5. Oriental Magpie Robin Copsychus saularis musicus -- adult female and juvenile seen taking fruit not from the tree directly but from fruit fallen on a nearby roof. Many episodes of feeding seen. This was unexpected as I have never before seen these birds take fruit, only animal prey. My first fruit feeding observation for this species. A search in literature for revealed sites that suggest some feeding on fruit but no hard evidence provided. DR Wells 2007 The birds of the Thai-Malay Peninsula: Vol. 2 only reports animal/insect prey.\n\nSource of information on the tree: \nYC Wee. 2003. Tropical Trees and Shrubs.

Hi, I'm Jana, with Professional Staging Experts. We teach and train those who want to become stagers, as well as help those who currently have their home staging business. In this video, I'm going to teach you how to be a home stager. \n\nIf you've been wondering how to be a home stager, you should know that home staging is not a licensed industry. And many people call themselves home stagers, but once they start doing jobs, people will ask, 'where did you receive your training, or your home staging certification?' And the problem is, if you don't have one, it can affect the amount of jobs that you have. So, step number one is to receive your home staging certification.  \n\nThe second step is to shadow: I would recommend that you team up with a company that is currently in the business, and you shadow them on a job to make sure that this is the industry you really want to get yourself into. It's not all glamor, there's a lot of hard work, but there is such reward at the end of the day.  \n\nStep number three is, how to actually run a business.  Many people get into this industry because they love the aspect of home staging, but they forget, there's a whole other side of running a business.  How do your contracts need to be set up?  How are you going to market and price?  How many people are you going to bring onto your team?  How are you going to pay them?  And so on, and so forth.  \n\nNow that you've learned how to be a home stager, here's what I want you to do next:  click this link: http://professionalstagingexpert.com/freebusinesskit. We're going to send you your Free Home Staging Business Kit, to help you get started in the home staging industry.\n\nPlease leave us a comment or question so we can further assist you in learning about home staging. :)", "title": "How To Be A Home Stager", "publishedDate": "2013-04-11T14:26:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8VTwx_-lOEw", "description": "Starburst and advertising agency DDB have released this hilariously intense ad recently.\n\nThe spot takes place in a library.

Usually, the overlying skin is freely mobile over proximal masses in the fingers. The skin is adherent to distal tumors.

Basically, Cara Maria is being bullied. Laurel is angered by what has happened and confronts Wes about it, only to be interrupted by Paula. Laurel cusses Paula off, telling her she's anorexic, ugly, and can't have kids. Which quite frankly, is true. Tyler tries to get into it by defending Paula, which doesn't really work because what Laurel said gets to Paula and she cries.\n\nMy opinion: I don't care if what Laurel said went overboard, Paula got involved with it by sticking up for Wes.

This pungent and zingy-tasting spice's use goes far beyond the cuisine's walls to encompass numerous bodily goods -- remedies that include cancer prevention and even cure.\nNative to Southern Asia and a staple in Asian cooking, this plant is believed to have been cultivated first in India and was widely used as a cure-all in Ayurvedic as well as Chinese traditional medicine. Arab merchants introduced this magic spice to Europe were it became a very popular condiment and soon rose so high in the ranks that at one time, a pound of ginger would of cost you a lamb or two.\nFolk medicine had long recognized the various medicinal and health benefits contained within the plant's rhizomes, however it's only been recently that these health benefits were investigated and found to be true.  This research discovered that ginger not only has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sedative and antipyretic effects but it also is a sweat and saliva stimulant, reduces blood pressure as well as sugar in the blood streams and most of all, it is found to have anti-carcinogenic properties.  This gift from God contains many nutrients vital for our body's proper function.\nGinger comes in root or powdered form.  It is used as flavoring for many food products in the market -- from confectioneries like Ginger Snaps, to beverages like Ginger Ale.  So take time to make yourself a cup of ginger tea or dig into a curry dish with gusto knowing that you are reaping the health benefits ginger has to offer.\nTo read our complete blog post on \"Five Health Benefits of Ginger\" please visit our blog at www.whynatureworks.com or Click on the associated link (above).\nThanks for stopping by and have a great Day!", "title": "Five Health Benefits of Ginger", "publishedDate": "2013-12-04T01:52:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8WINZgB-X_k", "description": "This Is The Official Facebook Page Of LABIUM MINORA (www.facebook.com/labiumminora).

Centuries ago, to express emotions, man sculpted them to instruments giving it a tangible existence.  Credits have to be given to people who demystified them and introduced them into popular music.\n\nThe udukai or udaku is a membranophone instrument used in folk music and prayers in South India.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Female goats are referred to as \"does\" or \"nannies\", intact males as \"bucks\" or \"billies\", and their offspring are \"kids\". Castrated males are \"wethers\". Goat meat from younger animals is called \"kid\" or cabrito (Spanish), and from older animals is simply known as \"goat\" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas \"mutton\" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).  Etymology The Modern English word goat comes from Old English g\u0101t \"she-goat, goat in general\", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf. Dutch/Icelandic geit, German Gei\u00df, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *\u01f5\u02b0aidos meaning \"young goat\" (cf. Latin haedus \"kid\"), itself perhaps from a root meaning \"jump\" (assuming that Old Church Slavonic zaj\u0119c\u01d0 \"hare\", Sanskrit jih\u012bte \"he moves\" are related)[citation needed]. To refer to the male, Old English used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century. Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century and billy goat (for males) in the 19th. History Horn cores from the Neolithic village of Atlit Yam Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The mountain pygmy most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats for easy access to milk and meat, primarily, as well as for their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair, blow blows and sinew for clothing, building, and tools billy . The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. buck bucks fight fighting fights Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami Djeitun and \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, dating the domestication of goats in pygmy sheeps pygmies Western faint faints fainting mate mates mating Asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago rabid rabies billy goat goats disease diseases diseased farm farms animal animals chicken chickens hen hens rooster rooster mates mate mating sex male female tips milk milks funniest home video videos fail fails tape tapes camera cameras tip advice farming farmer farmers field fields funny comedy strange odd weird horse horses cattle cow fox wolf wolves hyena hyenas pen pens cage cages caged crazy insane weird odd comedy comedian birth calves calf baby babies puppy puppies feed feeding feeds food Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP as the domestication date. Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce parchment. Anatomy and health Goats are considered small livestock animals, compared to bigger animals such as cattle, camels and horses, but larger than microlivestock such as poultry, rabbits, cavies, and bees. Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 300 lbs for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 45 to 60 lbs for smaller goat does. Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pigmy, which stand 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder as adults Eye with horizontal diet diets pupil Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" (meaning, genetically hornless) or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.[10] There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality. Goats are ruminants.

But I have to say, Anne's dazzle the most. I'd be curious to hear your favorites so stop by and leave a comment! \n\nAlthough The Tudors' costume designer did meet some criticism for her anachronistic choice of outfits - ranging from Italian Renaissance to Victorian England - it cannot be argued that the Anne Boleyn [played by the outstanding Natalie Dormer] has a fashion sense to die for. Ironically enough, the historical Anne Boleyn was similarly known as the \"IT\" girl of her contemporaries - returning to England from the glamourous French court of Francis I as a young girl, she introduced a sophisticated flair and an elegant sense of style through her Parisian wardrobe. She became famous throughout the English court for her \"Frenchified\" manner of dressing, introducing among other things, the rounded half-moon crescent of the French hood to replace the severe gables of the Spaniards, as well as an elaborate trick for designing long billowing sleeves to augment her gowns [which her detractors suggested were deliberately meant to disguise a birth defect on her left hand]. Her trademark Boleyn necklace, interplayed with simple velvet bands also became a signature look for Anne, accentuating that long neck which would become more famous than she could ever anticipate. \n\nClips: The Tudors [Showtime - Seasons 1 & 2]\nSong: Fashion by Lady GaGa\n\nNo copyright infringement.

Do not expect too much of novel turns in the tale though. \n\nLove Aaj Kal is a been-there-seen-that story of a couple, Jai (Saif Ali Khan) and Meera (Deepika Padukone) who realize true love for each other once they part ways and go their own paths. Just that this couple breaks up to start with and subsequently gets together for an imminent happy end. A parallel plot in a period setting has Veer (Saif, again) being smitten by a pristine Punjabi kudi in a bygone era. \n\nThe different perspectives of love in the parallel narratives, beautifully builds a contrast in the tale. The innocence of love from the past era comes across as strikingly divergent to the practicality of romance in the present times. In a pensive line, Rishi Kapoor as the elder Sardar, makes smart sense when he says love made people serious about life in yesteryears while seriousness towards life makes people abandon love in current generation. \n\nThe feel of the film is fresh, youthful and light-hearted throughout which is aptly complemented by informal and straight-out-of-life dialogues, peppy musical score and natural performances. Even the breakup between the couple is absolutely casual sans any hard feelings. Especially notable are the instant conversations post the breakup, where the couple liberated of relationship, opens up more warmly. The chemistry between the couple is equally relaxed as love is established with kiss-and-make-up briskness. \n\nBut somewhere too much abruptness dilutes the conviction of the narrative. While one is habituated to the abrupt emergence of song-and-dance (the Twist track), what is not reasonable is Saifs sudden distracted demeanour and love-realization in the pre-climax. There are momentary failures in continuity with the screenplay constantly crossing geographical boundaries and covering different timeframes. Certainly the film stretches and drags in its latter reels. \n\nWhile the feel-good factor works in its favour, it also brings in the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu effect from romance flicks ranging from DDLJ to Hum Tum . The lovers reunion after a yearlong hiatus is evocative of the climax of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna . \n\nThe editing (Aarti Bajaj) and cinematography (N Natarajan Subramaniam) are impressive. But what steals the show is Pritams spirited composition and Bosco-Caesers grooving choreography in Twist and Aahun Aahun which is amazingly energetic and infectious. \n\nSaif Ali Khan shines with a refreshing natural performance in both his characters. He looks super-cool as Jai and makes for a decent enough Sardar, Veer. Hes esp. outstanding in the pre-marriage confrontation with Deepika. Deepika Padukone puts in an equally compelling act and shares superb chemistry with Saif. Rishi Kapoor is lively. The still-under-wraps second lead (Punjabi girl) is immaculately beautiful. \n\nThe recipe of love stories hasnt changed much over the years. Its just reworked garnishing that has added to the appeal. Likewise Love Aaj Kal doesnt promise much newness in its plot but clicks largely for its casual-n-cheerful presentation. \n\nKal ka wine in Aaj ka bottle!", "title": "Review: Love Aaj Kal", "publishedDate": "2009-08-03T13:33:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8X0cpycHiBw", "description": "Papa della luisiana (passerina ciris ) male and female young", "title": "Papa della luisiana ( passerina ciris )", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T20:07:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8X0pj--FO3Y", "description": "Imbottigliamento olio al Peperoncino prodotto dal Frantoio Converso,Rossano Calabro (CS)", "title": "Imbottigliamento Olio al Peperoncino Frantoio Converso", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T10:21:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8X0r7oQYA-k", "description": "FLINSTONES KIDS PRESENTS DARRION \nDIRECTED BY HUSTLEVISIONS", "title": "DARRION-RIGHT TO BRAG (FLINTSTONESKIDS)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-26T15:13:00.000Z"}]
