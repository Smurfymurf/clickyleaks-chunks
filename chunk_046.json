It is one of the most visited destinations in Hyderabad. Zoo hours vary by season, and the zoo is closed on Mondays.\n\nNehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad was established in vide G.O.Ms. No.247, dated 26 October 1959. It was opened to the public on 6 October 1963. The Nehru Zoological Park is run by forest department, Government of Telangana, and is named after the first prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nThe zoo occupies 380 acres (150 ha) and is adjacent to the 600-acre (240 ha) Mir Alam Tank. Nearly 100 species of birds, animals and reptiles are housed at the zoo, including indigenous animals like the Indian rhino, Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, panther, gaur, Indian elephant, slender loris, python, as well as deer, antelopes and birds. The 600-acre (240 ha) Mir Alam Tank with its unique multiple arched bund (embankment), attracts hundreds of migratory birds, providing yet another attraction for the zoo.\n\nThe nocturnal house at the zoo artificially reverses night and day for the animals so that nocturnal animals are active while visitors are at the zoo. This exhibit includes fruit bats, slender loris, slow loris, civets, leopard cats, hedgehogs, barn owls, mottled wood owls, fishing owls, and great horned owls. There is also an aquarium, dino park, butterfly park and tortoise house.\n\nSnakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\n\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses \u2014 exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific. Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. More than 20 families are currently recognized, comprising about 500 genera and about 3,400 species. They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to the Reticulated python of up to 8.7 meters (29 ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 meters (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.\n\nMost species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE to my channel and visit again.", "title": "Snake Python Sleeping At a Corner.", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T17:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rD94Wj-kgs", "description": "www.JPBOUVETMUSIC.com --- @JPBOUVET --- @DREWOFTHEDREW --- @MIKELINDEN1\n\nRecording \"The Adventures of Uncle Pennybags\" from Mike Linden's album, \"Bubble & Squeak.\"\nThe album is available at www.mikelinden.bandcamp.com AND IT IS AWESOME.\n\nMastering by Chris Leon Productions\n\nJP GEAR:\nDrums:\n-DW Performance Series (22 bass drum, 14 snare, 10, 12, 14 toms)\n-PDP 13\" Steel Piccolo Side Snare\n\nHeads:\n-Remo Coated Ambassadors (Snare = Vintage, Toms = Ambassador and Ambassador X)\n-Bass Drum = Remo PowerStroke 3\n\nMeinl Cymbals:\n-22\" Byzance Brilliant Medium Ride\n-16\" Byance Traditional Hats\n-18\" Byzance Brilliant Thin Crash\n-19\" Byzance Brilliant Medium-Thin Crash\n-22\" MB20 Heavy Crash\n\nSticks: Vic Firth 5A Extremes\n\nDREW GEAR:\nMoog MF-101 Lowpass Filter\nLine 6 M9 and M13\n2 Modified Ernie Ball VP Junior expression pedals\nHomemade distortions and overdrives and bass\nDR Neon Orange strings\nDW 5000 Kick Pedal Killswitch\nAshdown AMB 500 Head\nMesa Boogie 2 x 10 cab", "title": "JP Bouvet and Drew Ofthe Drew - Mike Linden's \"The Adventures of Uncle Pennybags\"", "publishedDate": "2012-09-30T17:02:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rE-CtZ4Bv0", "description": "A song sung by the Hmong band, Ordinary Day. \n\nSorry for any slightly wrong translation, this is my first english sub video and it's very time consuming so I did my best!

From its beachfront location Apsaras Beach Resort overlooks the attractive Andaman Sea. This region is also famous for its beautiful rock formations.Have a refreshing swim in the pool lined with palm trees and animal sculptures and gaze out into the beach and sea from the edge. While the children are kept busy in the kids room why not enjoy a quiet moment at the spa or simply laze around the pool.Dine to charming views of the sunset at the elegant beach bar which serves cool drinks and cocktails light snacks and barbecue dishes daily.

Since the formation of the\nAlberta Energy Regulator and the retirement of the ERCB, junior\nproducers have faced unreasonable expectations with regard to the\nregulation of the licensee liability rating program. The ERCB did\nnot enforce these regulations, but now the Energy Regulator is\nslamming the current owners of these wells. In the words of one of\nthe stakeholders I have spoken with: it seems they are trying to\ncover up for the lack of enforcement over the past decades. The\nresult is that hundreds of junior producers will be pushed into\nbankruptcy courtesy of the heavy-handed, ill-thought-out regulations\nand the mismanagement of the PC government.\nNovember 19, 2013 Alberta Hansard 2911\n\nMr. Speaker, you would have hoped that the PCs had learned their lesson from the 2008 royalty disaster, but I guess not. The PC government has so far failed to act to ensure that our junior producers get a fair shake. While the Minister of Energy said that he would look at this matter, action needs to take place now. As you wait, junior producers are being expected to pay millions in penalties. The licensee liability program is spiraling out of control.\n\nThe program looks at assets compared to liabilities. With the low price of gas uneconomical wells are shut in. Once a well is shut in, it's classified as a liability. Companies are given a short period of time in which they have to pay penalties, some over a million dollars. If the company is unable to pay, they become classified as noncompliant and, as such, are unable to raise any capital because wells are shut in. They can't get any money from the banks, and they can't afford to abandon the wells. Mr. Speaker, these companies are not trying to shirk their responsibilities, but it seems unfair to enforce these regulations suddenly without consultation or consideration of the devastating economic impact. The forced abandonment of these wells will significantly reduce municipal tax revenue as well as provincial royalties. The Energy Regulator must come back to the table and work on enforcement actions that are appropriate and will not drive junior producers out of production. The stakes are too high for the minister to sit by and watch our juniors forced out of business.", "title": "Member Statement   Jason Hale   Licensee Liability Rating LLR Program and Licence Transfer Process", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T21:30:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rf-47Bhbs4", "description": "This video is fragment of - Ray Mears' Wild Food (5)", "title": "Ray Mears Demonstrations - Poisonous Mushrooms", "publishedDate": "2013-10-11T23:06:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rf121MG8gQ", "description": "A provisional cast on is used in knitting patterns that require later work down from the cast on.

Instead, he stayed and realized two things about himself. \"I realized that I can sit in a man's seat, but I'm not going to be a real man until I can pick up my phone and have a model to call,\" he says. \"And number two, I just really wanted to acknowledge you because I've been asking God a question for a while now about relationships, and when you spoke, and you and your son spoke, I realized why I have not been able to find my good thing.\"\n\nIyanla says that original exchange and the audience member's aha! moment both boil down to one thing: responsibility. It's a lesson Iyanla says her Lakota heritage taught her long ago. \"There's only one man. His name is all men. There's only one woman. Her name is all women. There's only one child, and its name is all children,\" she says. \"And we are responsible to look out for each other. To take care of each other.

There's really a section for just about anything you can imagine - and I'm sure you'll find some things you'd have never imagined... ever!\n\nIn this video I first get off the BTS skytrain and the market is just a 5 minute walk from there. Just follow the crowds and you'll be lead straight to the gates of the market.\n\nClothes and retro designed trendy fashion are all popular at the market, but one of the most interesting sections is the cat and dog and pets section. If you should happen to want to purchase a pet on you holiday in Bangkok, you can get one at JJ Market!\n\nOne thing can be guaranteed on any visit, it will be hot! So make sure you stay hydrated when you visit. There are plenty of drink stands where you can grab a cold bottle of water or a beverage that I drank called \"nam bai bua bok\" which is pennyworth juice - healthy and refreshing.\n\nIn Bangkok (and all throughout Thailand for that matter), food is never far away. All throughout Chatuchak Market (\u0e15\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e19\u0e31\u0e14\u0e08\u0e15\u0e38\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23) there are infinite stalls selling quick street food snacks and full meal options. You can find sit down air conditioned restaurants serving touristy Thai food, or you can grab a local style bowl of noodles or stir fried pad kra pao. Also located in the maze of the market are bars and coffee shops.\n\nSo I hope you enjoyed this video and thank you so much for watching.\n\nBe sure to stop by the weekend market and do some serious shopping the next time you're in Bangkok!\n\nHow to get to Chatuchak:\n\nThe easiest way to get to the Chatuchak Weekend Market is by either taking the BTS skytrain to Mo Chit (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15) station or by taking the MRT underground to either Chatuchak or Khampeng Phet station (both basically have exits that lead directly to the market).\n\nHours: \n\nSaturday and Sunday are the main days and it's open from 6 am -- 6 pm, Friday the market is open from 6 am -- 6 pm (but only some stall open, mostly wholesale bulk purchasing), Wednesday and Thursday from 6 am -- 6 pm (only for plants - so don't go if you're looking for the full market options). \n\nThe BEST time to visit is either Saturday or Sunday starting at around 10 am.\n\nMusic in this video:\n\nThis video contains royalty free music by Rick Clarke (Rickvanman) from his free royalty free music website: http://music4yourvids.co.uk/\n\nThe track used in this video is called \"Trance 2009.\" \n\nHere is a direct download to the song: http://199.91.154.91/69quwzubufwg/fe2r51xaux4biyc/Trance+2009.MP3\n\nAll license information can be found here: http://music4yourvids.co.uk/licence.html\n\nI used this song royalty free under the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0.

Part 15 of my documentary, \"Mucky Secrets\", about the fascinating marine creatures of the Lembeh Strait in Indonesia. Watch the full 90-minute documentary at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJMZ6reOB0E\n\nOne fish that divers should be wary of in the Lembeh Strait is the demon stinger (Inimicus didactylus) as its sting is extremely painful and can be deadly to humans. They have excellent camouflage and often lie partially buried in the muck. These fish are more closely related to the lethal stonefish than to scorpionfishes, and are known by a multitude of other evocative common names including spiny devilfish, bearded ghoul and sea goblin.\n\nThe lower two rays of the pectoral fins are detached from the fin, and the demon stinger walks on them in a manner similar to some dragonets.\n\nDemon stingers have no known predators. Many fellow bottom dwellers are oblivious to their existence. We see a fireworm (Chloeia parva) a type of bristleworm, crawling right over the top of a well-camouflaged demon stinger.\n\nLike their scorpionfish relatives, waspfishes (family Tetrarogidae) are also armed with venomous spines in their dorsal fin. We see another type of polychaete worm wriggling past a wispy waspfish (Paracentropogon longispinis). The wispy waspfish's coloration is variable.\n\nBandtail waspfishes (Paracentropogon zonatus) are sometimes found too, and the whiteface waspfish (Richardsonichthys leucogaster) is one of the more common types.\n\nWith its spines erect, like its namesake's crest, the cockatoo waspfish (Ablabys taenianotus) sways from side to side, mimicking a dead leaf in surge. They are sometimes found in pairs on the open seabed.\n\nThere are English captions showing either the full narration or the common and scientific names of the marine life, along with the dive site names.\n\nThe full Mucky Secrets nature documentary features a huge diversity of weird and wonderful marine animals including frogfish, nudibranchs, scorpionfish, crabs, shrimps, moray eels, seahorses, octopus, cuttlefish etc..\n\nThanks to Chris Zabriskie of http://chriszabriskie.com for the music track \"Divider\", and to Kevin MacLeod of http://www.incompetech.com for the track, \"Tenebrous Brothers Carnival - Mermaid\".

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to ban assault weapons to racial discrimination. According to Hammer, \"banning people and things because of the way they look went out a long time ago. But here they are again. The color of a gun. The way it looks. It's just bad politics.\"\n\nHammer's comparison came during a discussion on NRA News about Sen. Feinstein's plans to introduce legislation to ban assault weapons during the new Congress. Hammer warned that the United States government could engage in firearm confiscation \"in order to control the masses.\"\n\n\n\n    HAMMER: Well we've tried to tell people that in order to control the masses they have to take your guns. We saw it in Cuba. I mean we have so many Cuban-Americans who understand. But there are just too many people who don't believe it can happen here. And I hope they are right, but in order to keep it from happening here it's going to be a massive, expensive and long fight.\n\n    GINNY SIMONE, HOST: And it sure is. And we'll see what happens as things move along because Feinstein says she is going to move pretty quickly on this. So, as you said, it's all going to unfold pretty quickly.\n\n    HAMMER: Yep, and the bill that she passed in '95 [the 1994 assault weapons ban] pales by comparison to what she is trying to do now.\n\n    SIMONE: Absolutely.\n\n    HAMMER: She is invigorated by the tragedy. She believes that America will swing with her. And it's going to be a big fight, Ginny.\n\n    SIMONE: And they even admit this is about banning the ugliest guns, it's about cosmetics and it has nothing to do about how a firearm works.\n\n    HAMMER: Well, you know, banning people and things because of the way they look went out a long time ago. But here they are again. The color of a gun. The way it looks. It's just bad politics.\n\nHost Ginny Simone's claim that the proposed ban is about \"banning the ugliest guns\" is plainly false. According to Sen. Feinstein, the impetus for the ban is the capability of assault weapons, explaining in a December 17 press release that her legislation would target \"the most dangerous guns\":\n\n    I have been working with my staff for over a year on this legislation,\" Feinstein added. \"It will be carefully focused on the most dangerous guns that have killed so many people over the years while protecting the rights of gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons that fall outside the bill's scope. We must take these dangerous weapons of war off our streets.\"\n\nThe NRA has not shied away from comparing gun regulations to past instances of discrimination. In August, the NRA issued a press release that compared a decision by the University of Colorado to house students who wish to carry guns on campus in their own dormitory to the infamous 1896 Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson, which laid the groundwork for racist \"separate but equal\" laws. NRA News host Cam Edwards struck a similar tone on his show regarding the University of Colorado policy, stating, \"We are back to segregation now.\"\n\nHammer has remained an active member of NRA leadership since serving as president of the organization between 1995 and 1998. In her capacity as the organization's primary lobbyist in Florida, Hammer was reportedly instrumental in the 2005 enactment of the NRA-drafted \"Kill At Will\" law in that state. Testifying before a task force to examine the law after it was connected to the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Hammer stated that the NRA was \"proud to have been a part of the process\" in enacting the law. \n\nSee more at: http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/01/04/new-nra-talking-point-banning-assault-weapons-i/192021", "title": "New NRA Talking Point: Banning Assault Weapons Is Just Like Racial Discrimination", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T18:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rkdNkNXBRk", "description": "GAMP Middle School Choir- Winter 2013", "title": "GAMP Middle School Choir- Winter 2013 Jingle Bells", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T15:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rkxGwz-CsU", "description": "Download, paste link      www.youtube-mp3.org", "title": "Josip Ivancic feat.

Barack Hussein Obama.  At least that's the ruling of Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis, which flies in the face of Florida Supreme Court precedent.\n\nWhere does Judge Lewis get this when Florida Statute clearly states \"the... nomination of any person to office...may be contested in the circuit court...by any elector or any taxpayer...\"?\n\nHere's how the judge defends his position. \"If the plaintiff was challenging the candidate's eligibility for any other office, his analysis would be correct and [the law] would apply.  Political parties determine their [presidential] nominee at a national convention pursuant to rules that the parties draft and approve ....\"\n\nSo, judge, what you're saying is political parties can get away with nominating illegal candidates?  I guess that's better saying Obama must get the nomination because he's the One, right?\n\u2003\nIf that's not bad enough, Judge Lewis made a couple other questionable rulings in the case.  He said that since Barack Obama was a citizen, he was automatically a \"natural born\" citizen.  So the Founding Fathers just threw in that term, \"natural born,\" to make the Constitution a little longer?  Finally, Lewis said it was the plaintiff's burden to prove ineligibility.  Okay, if that's true, why not let the plaintiff subpoena Obama's birth records and related documents?\n\nYour honor, I respectfully ask that you take a refresher course at Tallahassee Community College that can, shall we say, help you hone your legal skills. And three cheers for plaintiff Michael Voeltz, who as a Democrat, wants to see his party do the right thing.  As for Obama, I've said it before and I say it again.

Enjoy them, utilize them, and share them!  I am a current full-time Kindergarten teacher so I know what it's like to be looking around for quality content in my classroom!  You can ALSO purchase the raw video file and/or audio file of those 50+ songs at my website (if you need them for some reason).

THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING!\n\n\nFAQ's:\n\nQ: Who is Mr. Harry?\nA: I am Pete Harry.  First name Pete.  Last name Harry.  I am the founder & content creator for Harry Kindergarten Music, LLC.  Check out ALL of my links at the bottom!   I am a full-time Kindergarten teacher in Bellwood, PA and live w/ my beautiful wife, Jen and 2 young children, Justice (daughter) & Paxton (son).  To clarify, I am NOT Jack Hartmann, but I do love his stuff!  You should check out his website too- www.jackhartmann.com.  I am NOT Mark D. Pencil, but I have partnered w/ him before to make videos for his songs- check out his website too- www.markdpencil.com!\n\nQ: When is my favorite Harry Kindergarten video coming back???????!!!!!!\nA: I am slowly, but surely re-making most of my Harry Kindergarten videos.  If there was a particular video that you loved from several years ago and it's not  back up yet, be patient and it may re-appear in time!   As mentioned earlier, I am a full-time teacher, place a HIGH value on my family & values, and am extremely busy, so it might just take a little bit of time until you see your \"old favorite\" pop back up again.  Changing my kids' diapers and taking them to the playground comes before re-making videos, but if you are reallllllllllllly desperate, email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com or inquire at my Facebook group page and make a request so I have it on my radar screen.  I am NOT remaking old Jack Hartmann videos, but Jack IS and you can find those as HE remakes them and posts them at his YouTube page: www.youtube.com/jackhartmann.  \n\nQ: Do you speak at conferences?\nA: Yes!  My ability to speak at teacher conferences during the school year is \"tight\" because I am currently a classroom teacher and only have a set number of personal days.  However, the SUMMER time is wide-open and I'd love to come to your conference and do a session/seminar!  Some of the topics I've typically spoken to teachers about include music and technology in the classroom, classroom management, running a creative morning meeting, and utilizing YouTube in the early childhood classroom.  Email me at pete@harrykindergartenmusic.com to make a speaking request.  \n\nQ: How do you make your Harry Kindergarten content?\nA: Songs are made on Garageband and videos are made on iMovie (both programs that are free on a Mac computer)", "title": "The Sight Word Song (Version 1)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T14:11:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rmj42AnqKs", "description": "In this eleventh chapter of Thompson/Center's \"World of Muzzleloading\" series, we follow Gregg Ritz (http://greggritz.com/) and Tiffany Lakosky (http://www.thecrush.tv/) as they show proper technique for cleaning the breech plug.\n\nToday it's unusual to have ignition issues with inline muzzleloaders like the Triumph or the Encore.\n\nThe sport of muzzleloading is the fastest growing segment in the shooting sports industry today!\n\nhttp://www.tcarms.com\n\nT/C's World of Muzzleloading Showcase is an indepth look at every aspect of hunting with a muzzleloader.

It looks great, it taste great and it\u2019s really easy to make.\n\nPour one and half measures of vodka (37.5ml) in to the glass. Then get your pineapple juice. Pineapple juice, you will see in a second, gives it a nice kind of frothy texture on the top when you shake it, a really nice feel. Use a double shot of pineapple juice (50ml).\n\nNow a lot of people don\u2019t use fresh raspberries in their French martinis, but it really adds a nice depth to the drink, so put about 2 or 3 fresh raspberries in there, to give it a nice freshness. It really compliments the raspberry liqueur, which we are going to use now. You can use any raspberry liquor, but here we are going to use Chambord raspberry, just under a shot in there.\n\nNow what to do here is a dry shake, before adding the ice, this kind of shake emulsifies the ingredients and gives a nice frothiness. Then add ice to the cocktail shaker, and give it a shake.\n\nThen fine strain into the cocktail glass and to finish off, just place a nice little raspberry on the top and there you go!\n\nThat is your French Martini.\n\nDon't just take my word for it, why not make one today and find out for your self! \nWhy not leave a comment telling me how you useful this recipe was, or what did you learn from this tutorial that you will use in the future?", "title": "How to make a French Martini cocktail", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T21:20:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rqn_otVoNU", "description": "STRAPPING YOUNG LAD - Relentless \nFrom the album \"S.Y.L.\".\nCentury Media 2003\n\nCMDistro - http://www.cmdistro.com/Artist/Strapping_Young_Lad/11313\n\nBest Buy - http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&_dynSessConf=2970986162488294805&id=pcat17071&type=page&st=strapping+young+lad&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=15&sp=&qp=&list=n&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960\n\niTunes - itunes.com/strappingyounglad\n\nAmazon MP3 - http://www.amazon.com/Strapping-Young-Lad/dp/B000QKUDWE/ref=sr_f1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1245690643&sr=101-1\n\nEMP.de - http://www.emp.de/bin/shop.php?Sucheintrag=strapping+young+lad&list_sort=&prog=search&tc=SEARCH&stat=yes\n\nAmazon.de - http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=nb_ss_m?__mk_de_DE=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Dpopular&field-keywords=strapping+young+lad\n\nAmazon.co.uk - http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_m_h_?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&field-keywords=strapping+young+lad\n\nPlay.com - http://www.play.com/Search.aspx?searchtype=musicartist&searchstring=strapping+young+lad&page=search&pa=search\n\nHMV.com - http://hmv.com/hmvweb/simpleSearch.do?searchUID=2386392072899196266&pGroupID=-1&adultFlag=false&primaryID=-1&simpleSearchString=strapping+young+lad", "title": "STRAPPING YOUNG LAD - Relentless (OFFICIAL VIDEO)", "publishedDate": "2009-01-16T21:34:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1rr4tXN2eJM", "description": "Music video by Ocean Colour Scene performing The Day We Caught The Train.

Studies of other structures like Yonaguni in modern day Japan have allowed scientists to determine that the two giant pyramids, apparently made of something like a thick glass, are really impressive - each of them is larger than the pyramid of Cheops in Egypt.\n\n \n\nRecently American and French scientists as well as other countries that are conducting surveys in areas of the seabed of the Bermuda Triangle, claim to have found a pyramid standing upright on the seabed that has never been discovered. The length of the base of this pyramid reached 300 meters, 200 meters height, and distance from base to the tip of the pyramid is about 100 meters above the sea floor. Preliminary results show this structure to be made of glass or a glass-like (crystal?) material, as it is entirely smooth and partially translucent.\n\n\nWhen talking about size, this newly re-discovered pyramid is larger in scale than the pyramids of ancient Egypt. On top of the pyramid there are two very large holes, sea water at high speed move through the second hole, and therefore the raging waves roll by forming a giant vortex that makes the waters around this cause a massive surge waves and mist on the sea surface. This new discovery makes scientists wonder if this is having an affect on passing boats and planes and could be the reason for all the mystery surrounding the area.", "title": "Pyramid of bermuda triangle", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T15:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1s2LPRd3OnE", "description": "", "title": "BCN2013: Sascha Klein (GER) Bronze medallist in Mens 10m Platform", "publishedDate": "2013-07-28T14:53:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1s3Ix43cjXY", "description": "Check out our new music blog for more music!\nhttp://www.itseargasmic.com/\n\nSubscribe to SwagyTracks for more music daily !\nhttp://bit.ly/SubscribeSwagy\n\n.........\n \nDownload this track \u2022\nhttp://eargasmic.me/1iWlfiN\n\n\u2022 Ivan B -\nhttps://twitter.com/IvanBnw\nhttps://www.facebook.com/IvanBnw\nhttp://www.youtube.com/officialBreadnwater\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ivanbnw\n\n\u2022 Tido Vegas -\nhttps://twitter.com/TidoVegas\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tidovegas\n\nPicture credit \u2022 \nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/chwesser/13886943059/\nIf you are the owner of this picture and want it removed,contact me and I will delete the video as soon as possible,no drama!\n\n.........\n\nSecondary music channel \u2022\nhttp://www.youtube.com/itseargasmic\n\nFollow SwagyTracks on\nFacebook \u2022 http://www.facebook.com/SwagyTracks\nTwitter \u2022 https://twitter.com/SwagyTracks\nSoundCloud \u2022 https://soundcloud.com/SwagyTracks\nInstagram \u2022 http://instagram.com/swagytracks\nTumblr \u2022 http://swagytracks.tumblr.com\n\n.........\n\nThere is no copyright infringement intended for the song or picture.

Engine 12 is a 1992 Pierce Lance with a 500 gallon tank and 1250 GPM pumping capabilities.  Tower Ladder 5 is a 2012 Pierce Arrow XT with a 95 foot mid-mount platform tower ladder.

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nMax: http://www.youtube.com/user/gassymexican\nMark: Mark: http://www.youtube.com/user/allshamnowow\nChilled: http://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage", "title": "COOKING WITH SEANANNERS (Video Game Time: TTT Animated)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T16:00:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1s7IXOHGlMI", "description": "Debut single from the upcoming EP, Extended Play.

Junto con Pie Grande y el Yeti, Nessie es quiz\u00e1 el \"misterio\" m\u00e1s difundido de la criptozoolog\u00eda.\n \nLa mayor\u00eda de los cient\u00edficos y otros expertos afirman que las pruebas que apoyan la existencia de Nessie no son convincentes, y consideran dichos informes fraudes o identificaciones err\u00f3neas de criaturas reales.\n\nHistoria de los avistamientos\n\nLos rumores de un presunto gran animal o monstruo que mora en el lago han circulado durante siglos desde hace 1.500 a\u00f1os, aunque la precisi\u00f3n, credibilidad y veracidad de tales historias siempre se ha cuestionado. Muchos habitantes locales argumentan a favor de su existencia, sin embargo algunos esc\u00e9pticos sugieren que estos rumores de Nessie existen en su gran mayor\u00eda para favorecer a la industria del turismo y al folclore local. La historia de los supuestos avistamientos y la creaci\u00f3n del mito del monstruo del lago Ness, ser\u00eda la siguiente:\n\nLa m\u00e1s antigua referencia conocida sobre una misteriosa criatura presente en el r\u00edo y el lago Ness, se encontrar\u00eda en la Vida de san Columba (Vita Columbae, un texto del siglo VII), donde se describe que en el a\u00f1o 565 San Columba (521-597) habr\u00eda salvado a alguien que supuestamente estaba siendo atacado por un animal en el lago. Sin embargo, muchos cr\u00edticos han cuestionado la credibilidad de esta historia, pues existe otra historia con caracter\u00edsticas fant\u00e1sticas, donde se dice que Columba habr\u00eda matado a un hombre salvaje tan s\u00f3lo con el poder de su propia voz. Igualmente algunas personas han asociado como primeras referencias, a antiguas leyendas locales sobre unos m\u00edticos caballos acu\u00e1ticos llamados kelpies; que se dicen habitar\u00edan en las profundidades de este lago.\n\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag) is a cryptid that is reputed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal has varied since it was brought to the world's attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with minimal and much-disputed photographic material and sonar readings.\n \nThe most common speculation among believers is that the creature represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs. The scientific community regards the Loch Ness Monster as a modern-day myth, and explains sightings as a mix of hoaxes and wishful thinking. Despite this, it remains one of the most famous examples of cryptozoology. The legendary monster has been affectionately referred to by the nickname Nessie (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag) since the 1950s.\n\nO monstro do lago Ness, monstro de Loch Ness, ou tamb\u00e9m conhecido simplesmente por Nessie, \u00e9 um cript\u00eddeo aqu\u00e1tico que alegadamente foi visto no Loch Ness (Lago Ness), nas Terras Altas da Esc\u00f3cia.

Mas no dia 29 de Maio de 2003, o governo da Esc\u00f3cia declarou que o monstro n\u00e3o existe e as ideias de que ele existe n\u00e3o passam de fruto da imagina\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n\u041b\u043e\u0445-\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435 (\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b.

Get the details right and you will sound more native, build confidence and earn the respect of native speakers more quickly.\n\nThe little details we want you to focus on are the filler words people use when they want to speak but don't know what to say. In English, these are words like, \"uh,\" \"um,\" and \"you know.\"\n\nHere are some example sentences:\n\n\"Yesterday I was... um... waiting for the bus and got caught in the rain.\"\n\n\"I want... you know... to do something important with my life.\"\n\nMany non-native English speakers use proper English words when speaking, but often forget to use English filler words.\n\nAs an example, a Japanese English learner might say something like, \"I went to, anooo, the bank yesterday.\"\n\nThere are two problems with forgetting to use English filler words:\n\nThe first is that you will not train your brain to think in English.\n\nThe second is that you will sound less like a native English speaker.\n\nTo watch a non-native speaker using English filler words really well, check out this great video of soccer star Hidetoshi Nakata.\n\nHis English isn't perfect, but he uses filler words smoothly.\n\nClick on the link below and listen carefully to his use of filler words when he doesn't know exactly what to say.\n\nWe should note, though, that people sound most competent and professional when they don't use filler words in ANY language. So, if you can, speak slowly and don't worry about having to say something every moment.\n\nNow get out and practice those... uh... filler words today! Really focus on thinking in English and using English filler words, and you'll build confidence and get fluent faster! \n\n\nFor more tips, lessons and videos, and to learn the 7 secrets every student must know to get fluent quickly, visit us at http://www.englishanyone.com/.", "title": "14 - The MOST IMPORTANT English words! - English Filler Words - How To Get Fluent In English Faster", "publishedDate": "2011-08-25T11:57:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1sUXpK36BPI", "description": "This is the fourth in a series of introductory videos by Ben Sullivan BVSc MRCVS, clinical manager and in-house vet for BCF Technology Ltd.

During the 1930s it was widely adopted for plant quarantine purposes because many plants, vegetables and some fruits were found to be tolerant to concentrations effective against the insects concerned. More recently it has been used extensively as an industrial fumigant for stored products, mills, warehouses, ships and railway cars. For this purpose it has now largely replaced hydrogen cyanide. Methyl bromide has also been used as a sterilizing agent, although it has approximately one tenth the activity of ethylene oxide against bacteria and fungi (Bruch, 1961; Richardson and Monro, 1962). Its use for the sterilization of space vehicles in combination with ethylene oxide has been reported by Vashkov and Prishchep (1967). At concentration x time products considerably higher than those needed to kill insects, methyl bromide may also control microorganisms such as Aspernillus spp. and Penicillium spp. in foodstuffs (Majumder, 1954).\n\nMethyl bromide is not as toxic to most insect species as are some other commonly used fumigants, such as HCN, acrylonitrile and ethylene dibromide. Nevertheless, other properties make methyl bromide an effective and versatile fumigant. The most important of these is its ability to penetrate quickly and deeply into sorptive materials at normal atmospheric pressure. Also, at the end of a treatment, the vapours dissipate rapidly and make possible the safe handling of bulk commodities. Another important property is the fact that many living plants are tolerant to this gas in insecticidal treatments. Methyl bromide is nonflammable and nonexplosive under ordinary circumstances and may be used without special precautions against fire.\n\nBecause methyl bromide has a comparatively low boiling point and is not greatly sorbed by many materials, it may be used for low temperature treatments that are not practicable with many other fumigants.\n\n\nAny questions / requests please contact:\n\nLEAF PEST CONTROL & HYGIENE SERVICES\nTel: 016-338 0960\nFAX: 03-9281 3682\n\nWebsite: www.daunpestcontrolhygieneservices.com.my/\n\n(FOR MALAYSIA ONLY)", "title": "Why need Fumigation", "publishedDate": "2013-01-10T04:38:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1sd9OuD2p9g", "description": "Pekoe the poodle attempts to play with a baby bunny.\n\n\nSoftware: iMovie\nDeveloper: Apple Inc\nLicense: http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/ilife09.pdf\n\nSoftware: Photoshop CS3\nDeveloper: Adobe\nLicense: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/eula/photoshopcs3.html\n\nMusic: Happy Boy End Theme\nAuthor: Kevin MacLeod\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/\nLicense: Creative Commons License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "title": "Pekoe the Poodle: Tries to Play with Baby Bunny", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T01:01:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1sd_xPn1Ccw", "description": "origin rules", "title": "Origin - Reciprocal (cover)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T10:13:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1sdpOnV6dFQ", "description": "This is a short demonstration of high temperature brazing for air conditioning and refrigeration piping.\nThis video is part of the heating and cooling series of training videos made to accompany my websites: www.graycoolingman.com and www.grayfurnaceman.com to pass on what I have learned in many years of service and repair.

Optimal control theory had been applied to neural networks, quantum systems (e.g. Klein-Gordon-Schrodinger equation, Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equation, meson exchange effect,n uclear reaction,etc) as well as inverse problems. Especially, the corresponding computational approach is adequately executed together with resultant theoretical conclusions for interpreting each other.

Knowing this information makes it much easier to draw the Lewis structure for HClO4.\n\nFor the HClO4 Lewis structure, calculate the total number of valence electrons for the HClO4 molecule.    After determining how many valence electrons there are in HClO4, place them around the central atom to complete the octets. Be sure to use the number of available valence electrons you found earlier.\n\nThere are a total of 32 valence electrons for the HClO4 Lewis structure.\n\nFor the Lewis structure for HClO4 you should take formal charges into account to find the best Lewis structure for the molecule.  The first structure you come up with might satisfy the octet rule for all the atoms but still not be the most likely Lewis structure for HClO4.\n\nGet more chemistry help at http://www.thegeoexchange.org/chemistry/bonding/", "title": "HClO4 Lewis Structure: How to Draw the Lewis Structure for HClO4", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T23:44:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1smd72A8wec", "description": "Installation of camaro stripe With paper premask", "title": "2010 2011 2012 2013 Camaro stripe Installation at Stripeman.com", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T18:23:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1snrKmL0BlE", "description": "Conhe\u00e7a a hist\u00f3ria de Arlindo, que mesmo depois de anos de muscula\u00e7\u00e3o decidiu apelar para outros m\u00e9todos para conquistar o corpo que hoje ele considera perfeito.", "title": "M\u00fasculos de \u00d3leo Mineral [Jornal da Clube - 25.12.13]", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T16:15:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1snvxUXKlw4", "description": "The worst part about the recent bombings in the Israeli--Palestinian conflict is the children & enculturation.", "title": "Sad Situation", "publishedDate": "2012-11-26T20:59:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1so0I9kDlOM", "description": "Visit http://thecoachingmanual.com/season-plan for 99 more complete session plans.\n\nThis defending session develops understanding of when to press and when to drop off, encouraging tactical awareness, communication and great execution.\n\nIn this conditioned small-sided game players must translate the defending skills from the rest of the session to a realistic match scenario.", "title": "Soccer Coaching Defending Drill: Small-Sided Game", "publishedDate": "2013-09-02T21:58:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1so7D5twHSE", "description": "", "title": "AZT Blocks Reverse Transcriptase", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T20:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1soKUCDh4NQ", "description": "Dakar 2012: Stop and go neutralisation \u00e9tape 11\n\n+ d'infos sur http://www.toys-motors-rallye.fr", "title": "Dakar 2012: Stop and go neutralisation \u00e9tape 11", "publishedDate": "2012-01-12T22:13:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1soOTJKw6rA", "description": "Pot Noodle Advert Moussaka Rap in HD", "title": "Pot Noodle Advert - Moussaka Rap HD", "publishedDate": "2009-06-25T15:11:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1socwnkbN5Y", "description": "El ser humano moderno se hibrid\u00f3 con los neandertales tras salir de \u00c1frica.\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son las caracter\u00edsticas gen\u00e9ticas que definen como especie biol\u00f3gica al Homo sapiens?

Budgerigars are the only species in the Australian genus Melopsittacus, and are found wild throughout the drier parts of Australia where the species has survived harsh inland conditions for the last five million years.[2] Budgerigars are naturally green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings, but have been bred in captivity with colouring in blues, whites, yellows, greys, and even with small crests. Budgerigars are popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, and ability to mimic human speech. The origin of the budgerigar's name is unclear. The species was first recorded in 1805, and today is the third most popular pet in the world, after the domesticated dog and cat.[3]\n\nThe budgerigar is closely related to the lories and the fig parrots.[4][5][6][7] They are one of the parakeet species, a non-taxonomical term that refers to any of a number of small parrots with long, flat and tapered tails. In both captivity and the wild, budgerigars breed opportunistically and in pairs.\n\nWild budgerigars are usually found to be mostly green in colour. Selective breeding, by breeders, over the years has caused changes in colour.

There, she was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (learn more about IIH here: http://bit.ly/1gR91Fq).

I'm doing this with the minimum level allowed each battle, except for a few missions where the exp given during other missions and main storyline, as well as the side quests for important skills like Nimble Dash and Critical Hit, were too great to stop me from leveling.\n\nThere are a few reasons I chose to do iSolo videos in normal mode and with the easiest oath or none at all:\n1. Normal mode gives more HP to the boss, thereby forcing me to keep up whatever strategy I figure out during the making of the video (or prior knowledge of the boss from past playthroughs).\n2. Combat exp is lessened during normal mode, as compared to hard or hero modes, and will help prevent premature leveling.\n3. Normal mode shows the boss HP, whereas hard and hero do not. This allows me to gain the extra BP (battle points) from the mission to make my progression to later missions faster, which enables me to do many missions with just one playthrough, thereby-- again-- helping to prevent premature leveling.\n4. Normal mode helps understand what attacks one should use, in that I am always aware of how much damage a certain type of attack does, whether that attack be from an object, secondary weapon, or a specific attack combination from iSolo, himself.\n\nAlso, please note that I will rarely (if ever) use potions during these videos. I feel that using potions during normal mode is basically infinite HP, being that the damage done is cut by quite a bit. There are moments during these videos that, had they been on hard or obviously hero modes, I would most certainly have been killed. This does NOT give me pause, however. The point, again, is to show the bosses moves and a players ability to run a mission and develop strategy on the fly.\n\nI do not practice these missions. I have played them before with my main character, but many of these bosses feel new to me; its been so long since having to actually worry about dodging. My main character is a Spear Lann, not swords. Add to that, he is a capped exp and AP character with the highest weapon and armor available, both of which are highly upgraded.\n\nThe point I am making with this statement is that I'm not used to these bosses, I'm not used to swords, and I'm definitely not used to \"worrying\" about dying during a run. My main is in an amazing guild called Samsara and we are very highly ranked on the west server with many uniquely active players (not alts). I rarely solo with my main as that is not community-oriented enough for me. Soloing is purely a fascination, not something I strive to be able to accomplish, especially not with perfection. I will get hit. I will die. I am ok with that. Live and learn and help those you care about.\n\nI hope this all makes sense :)", "title": "Vindictus - Hoarfrost Hollow - Culprit Behind the Disturbance - Eflame", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05T04:19:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1t5LCsfHIcg", "description": "Solo section from Floating World by Cacophony", "title": "Cacophony - Floating World (Solo Cover)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T17:55:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "1t5MtBck_k8", "description": "Aria T'Loak rushes in the Afterlife , but runs into a stasis trap.

The resistance of semiconductor materials decreases when the applied voltage is increased. This effect is used in varistors. This is why they are the most effective (and inexpensive) protection from impulse voltages of any kind. A distinctive feature of varistors is their symmetrical, pronounced nonlinear volt-ampere characteristic. Because of this, varistors can easily and effectively protect various devices form impulse voltages.A varistor and the protected device are connected in parallel. When the protected device operates normally the varistor is affected by its operating voltage. At this time the current flowing through the varistor is negligibly small. In such conditions the varistor works as an insulator.When a voltage impulse occurs, the varistor's resistance quickly drops to a fraction of an ohm. The device bridges the load, protecting it and converting the dissipated energy into heat. It happens thanks to the nonlinear volt-ampere characteristic of the varistor. During this short period of time a current of up to several thousands of amperes can be running through the varistor. After a voltage impulse has been dissipated the varistor restores its ultra-high resistance.Taxonomic voltage is a characteristic of a varistor. It is the voltage at a certain current. As a rule, the varistor manufacturers indicate a varistor's voltage at 1 milliampere as its taxonomic voltage.Another important characteristic of a varistor is its assumed dissipation capability. It describes the device's ability to convert dissipated electric energy into heat. The parameter mostly depends on the varistor's geometry and the design of its leads. Massive leads are often used to increase the dissipation capability. They play the role of a radiator. \"Progress\", the plant situated in Ukhta, is the largest mass manufacturer of small-size varistors in Russia. The varistors are made in the shape of disks. Their thickness is up to 10 mm (depending on the taxonomic voltage). They come with either wire or nipple leads. The taxonomic voltage of these varistors equals 1 milliampere. The voltage temperature coefficient is negative, no more than 0.05% per one Celsius degree.", "title": "Operation Principle of Varistors", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T07:45:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1tTtPLGjOJo", "description": "small solar water heater I set up that will heat (and pasteurize) water very quickly. made using 50' 1/4\" black tubing (black poly pipe). total cost $6.00.  water gets to 158F (70C) very quickly.

So I have Rene here again as my demo partner. First basic combinations I like to throw are always, you know, punch combinations. You've got jab, you've got cross, but again you always have to be ready off of that cross to sprawl especially when you come in for a take down. So again, I like to use, or set up with, the hands especially if I'm going to be setting up for kicks. So maybe I'd like to jab, cross and then an inside leg kick. Okay? Obviously you've got the jab, cross and then you have the outside leg kick. Those are basic combinations.\n\nIf I throw a jab, cross and I fire that knee, I have to be ready to sprawl because you're going to be coming in for that take down. Alright? So again, basic combinations. Jab, cross, inside leg kick. Jab, cross, outside leg kick. Or, the jab, cross, follow up with the knee. But remember, be ready to sprawl. It's an MMA fight. He's going to come in for that take down. Alright?\n\nRene: Now, the basic combinations, it depends what you want. If you just want to stay and stand up striking that's great, but some of you want to come in to shoot. So some good combination shoot is double-jab. For a single if you're southpaw, double-jab here, stepping in on your jab. Step in on your jab. And you hit the double. Okay? Another one could be a front hand technique. Switch your feet please. Alright? Could be jab, hook, shoot. So you want to punch off your front hand to cover the distance for your shots.", "title": "How to Do Basic Strike Combinations | MMA Fighting", "publishedDate": "2012-07-23T09:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1tdFtOOxZbE", "description": "Let's take a look back at some of last Friday's NEKTON Neon Night and Coach Fleck's message to the WMU students.", "title": "#NEKTON Neon Night - Remix", "publishedDate": "2013-04-17T17:46:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1tdJOYmWCsM", "description": "To Subscribe Easy Recipes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOrEf90ucqDhcmLBf9Ibgg?sub_confirmation=1 benefits of fruits and vegetables,health benefits of fruits and vegetables,benefits of fruit and vegetables,benefits of eating fruits and vegetables,denefits of fruits and vegetables chart,benefits of vegetables and fruits,the benefits of fruits and vegetables,benefit of fruits and vegetables,health benefits of fruit and vegetables,benefits of eating fruit and vegetables,benefits fruits and vegetables,benefits of juicing fruits and vegetables,fruits and vegetables benefits,health benefits of vegetables,health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables,benefits of fruits and vegetables for kids,\nwhat are the benefits of fruits and vegetables,nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables,benefits from fruits and vegetables,benefits of eating vegetables,health benefits fruits and vegetables,the benefits of fruit and vegetables,the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables,health benefits of vegetables and fruits,what are the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables,fruit and vegetable benefits,the health benefits of fruits and vegetables,vegetables health benefits,health benefit of fruits and vegetables,\nwhat are the benefits of eating fruit and vegetables,health benefits from fruits and vegetables,fruits and vegetables health benefits,list of fruits and vegetables and their benefits,benefits of organic fruits and vegetables,benefits of fruits and vegetables for health,what are the health benefits of eating fruits and, vegetables,health benefits of juicing fruits and vegetables,benefits of red fruits and vegetables,\nthe benefits of eating fruit and vegetables,benefits of all fruits and vegetables,benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables,what are the health benefits of vegetables,the benefits of vegetables,what are the health benefits of fruits and vegetables,what are the benefits of eating vegetables,the benefits of eating vegetables,benefits of fruit and vegetable diet,health benefits of eating fruit and vegetables,health benefits of eating vegetables,health benefits of all fruits and vegetables,fruits and vegetables benefits chart,fruit and vegetables benefits,fruit and vegetable benefits chart,health benefits vegetables,fruits and vegetables and their benefits,benefits of kiwi fruit,benefits of kiwi fruits,health benefits of kiwi fruit,kiwi fruit benefits,kiwi fruit health benefits,benefit of kiwi fruit,health benefit of kiwi fruit,benefits of kiwi fruit in pregnancy,kiwi fruit,kiwi fruit benefits for skin,kiwi fruits benefits,benefits of dragon fruit,health benefits of dragon fruit,dragon fruit benefits,benefit of dragon fruit,dragon fruit health benefits,dragon fruits benefits,health benefit of dragon fruit,dragon fruit benefit,benefits of eating fruits,benefits of eating fruit,health benefits of eating fruit,the benefits of eating fruit,benefits of eating fruit and veg,benefit of eating fruits,health benefits of eating fruits,benefit of eating fruit,benefits of eating fruits daily,what are the benefits of eating fruits,what are the benefits of eating fruit,best fruits to eat,benefits of eating fruit everyday,benefits of eating fruits everyday,benefits of eating fruit for breakfast,the benefits of eating fruits,benefits of eating kiwi fruit,benefits of dry fruits,\nbenefits of dried fruit,dry fruits benefits,health benefits of dried fruit,health benefits of dry fruits,benefits of dried fruits,dried fruit benefits,health benefits of dried fruits,benefits of dry fruits during pregnancy,dried figs health benefits,dry fruit benefits,dried fruit health benefits,dried fruits benefits,health benefits dried fruit,benefits of papaya fruit,health benefits of papaya fruit,papaya fruit benefits,benefit of papaya fruit,papaya health benefits,papaya fruits benefits,benefits of eating papaya fruit,papaya fruit health benefits,healthy foods,healthy food choices,what is healthy food,healthy food for kids,what are healthy foods,healthy food facts,healthy food,heart healthy foods,healthy foods to lose weight,healthy food options,healthy food tips,", "title": "Health Benefits of Custard Apple - Top 10 Benefits - Easy Recipes", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T05:41:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1tdMOufV0pQ", "description": "Le Pouvoir des F\u00e9es est un court-m\u00e9trage blablalandien enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par Toupie, avec sa propre voix et l'\u00e9criture du sc\u00e9nario compris.

Obviously many people know about The Light, they know about [the] out-of-body experience. The thing that really is, I think, important about the near-death experience in regard to the life review phenomena is that it isn't just a life review. It's a reliving of your life... When people describe the full experience, it's every single act that you have done, every single thought that you have thought, every single word that you have spoken \u2014 suddenly all of this is back with you. You are running through it again and you see and you experience the effects of these acts, these thoughts, and these words on other people. Let me just give you one brief example to illustrate this.\n\nI have a friend who when growing up was kind of a roughneck; he had a hot temper; he was always getting into scrapes. One day he was driving in his truck through the suburb in the town where he lived and he almost hit a pedestrian. And he got very aggravated with the pedestrian and he was a very big physical guy \u2014 still is \u2014 and a fight ensued. He punched this guy out and left him unconscious on the pavement, got back into his truck, and roared off.\n\n15 years later this guy has a near-death experience... and during the near-death experience, he has a life review. In his life review, this particular scene of the fight takes place again... And he said that, as many people do, he kind of experienced this from a dual aspect. There was a part of him that was almost as if he were high up in a building looking out a window and seeing the fight below. But at the same time he was observing the fight like a spectator, he found himself in the fight. Except this time he found himself in the role of the other person. And he felt all 32 blows that he had rained on this person originally 15 years ago now being inflicted upon himself. He felt his teeth cracking. He felt the blood in his teeth. He felt everything that this other person must have felt at that particular time. There was a complete role reversal; an empathic life review experience.\n\nAnd this is the sort of thing that many people report. And when they report these kinds of experiences, they realize that in our life, we are the very people that we hurt; we are the very people that we help to feel good. We experience these actions as though done to ourselves in the life review. So that when people start talking about The Golden Rule in the context of the near-death experience, The Golden Rule is not just a precept for moral conduct, it's the way it works. And you experience this during the life review. You learn that lesson in a very forceable way as a result of going through this kind of experience. And that's why when people have NDEs they change as much as they do! If you can even imagine what it must be like to go through your entire life and see everything that you've ever done, without judgment, but from a kind of almost omniscient point of view with regard to the effects of those actions, and see what your actions do to other people, it's a heavy kind of lesson. It's something that stays with you and it informs your conduct for the time after your near-death experience.\n\nSo it does give us a lot to think about and that's why I say in my book \"Lessons from the Light\" the near-death experience isn't given just to those who have the experience, it's given to all of us to learn from because all of us can profit by the lessons that near-death experiencers learn in the course of a life review or other aspects of their experience. We can grow from these lessons. We can apply these lessons into our daily lives.", "title": "NDE Researcher Kenneth Ring: The Golden Rule Dramatically Illustrated", "publishedDate": "2012-06-13T20:38:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1tih_oBCN6w", "description": "Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud - Cirug\u00eda Bucal y Maxilofacial - Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Los \u00c1ngeles de Chimbote 2013 - CD.

Once excreted, the negatives were recovered, cleaned, and studied in detail by an electron microscope; ultimately, they were printed into giant black and white works.\nThe project, titled \"I turn myself inside out\" is an almost uncomfortably intimate and human exploration of the photographic medium. Normally, images are produced and processed by machinery, light, and chemicals, but this provocative series substitutes the artists' own bodies and their fluids for the impersonal metal gears and glass lens of a camera.\nThe images themselves are so strong because of their unexpected three-dimensionality; while most film photographs flatten space, condensing foregrounds and background to create a compelling work of art, Evans and Lake's work does the opposite. Each frame looks like a scientific image taken from a microscope. The digestive process and the resultant breakdown of the film's emulsion afford each image its dimensionality, transcending the medium's traditional reliance on light and shadow to convey space.\nThe most miraculous aspect of the work lies perhaps in the tension that arises between the intimate and vulnerable bodily process and the somewhat impersonal aesthetic of the resultant images. Once printed, the images become abstract explorations of tone and space, their apparently inhuman, unemotional form subverted only by the knowledge of their painfully visceral creation.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Discoid Eczema - Get the Right Facts on Discoid Eczema", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T11:01:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u5DDhGeGjs", "description": "Havens guide to help you choose and buy the right Villeroy & Boch New Wave Cups http://bit.ly/11J0yHO\n\nThe numbered codes are unique web codes for www.havens.co.uk, to help you find the correct product.\n\nHavens have over 100 Years Experience in buying and selling quality crystal drinking glasses from around the world.", "title": "The Tableware Expert - Villeroy & Boch New Wave Cups", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T11:01:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u5xNpgbms8", "description": "", "title": "Rutherford brawl Adrianna vs Stephanie", "publishedDate": "2013-11-28T21:01:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u6-HQy_f1s", "description": "MANGA REVIEWS PLAYLIST: http://bit.ly/AzuriteMangaReviews\nMY WEBCOMIC = http://www.eraoferrors.com\nMANGA I'VE READ = http://myanimelist.net/mangalist/azuritereaction\nMY STREAM = http://www.twitch.tv/azuritereaction", "title": "MANGA REVIEW: Dragon Head", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T19:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u6-fPCfCCc", "description": "Acucrack remix pgr 2 soundtrack", "title": "Acumen Nation Semester of hate", "publishedDate": "2009-06-13T18:06:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u63IqqaD84", "description": "Song Cog lus\nArtist HandsBand \nHandsMusic..presents\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/HandsGroup\nTwitter @handsbandhmong\navailable on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/album/hands/id773657316\n\nSong : Cog lus\ntus sau : Nrees Xyooj\ntus sau Music : Handsband\n\nHands \n- Nrees Xyooj (Lead vocals, Guitar)\n- Faj Yaj (Guitar)\n- Nqee Xyooj (Bass)\n- Ntaus Yaj (Drum)\n\nNo.1 Hmong music contest #1 2012 @ phayao Thailand\nProduced by Nrees Xyooj\nRecorded at Dayone Records Chiangmai Thailand", "title": "Cog lus - Hands[New Single]", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T16:20:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "1u6ISr28UNA", "description": "The one and original Swine Flu!!

Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. The word \"polecat\" (with \"pole\" from either the French poule \"chicken\" or puant \"stinking\"), which in Europe refers to the wild relatives of the ferret, has been attested in the New World to refer to the skunk since the 1680s. The word \"squunck\" is attested in New England in the 1630s, probably borrowed from Abenaki or another Algonquian language, with the Proto-Algonquian form 'to urinate' and meaning 'fox The name of the family and of the most common genus (Mephitidae, Mephitis) means \"stench\", while Spilogale putorius means \"stinking spotted weasel\". Although the most common fur color is black and white, some skunks are brown or grey, and a few are cream-colored. All skunks are striped, even from birth. They may have a single thick stripe across back and tail, two thinner stripes, or a series of white spots and broken stripes (in the case of the spotted skunk). Some also have stripes on their legs. Diet Skunks are omnivorous, eating both plant and animal material and changing their diets as the seasons change. They eat insects and larvae, earthworms, grubs, small rodents, lizards, salamanders, frogs, snakes, birds, moles, and eggs. They also commonly eat berries, roots, leaves, grasses, fungi, and nuts.

Less often, skunks may be found acting as scavengers, eating bird and rodent carcasses left by cats or other animals. Pet owners, particularly those of cats, may experience a skunk finding its way into a garage or basement where pet food is kept. Skunks commonly dig holes in lawns in search of grubs and worms. Skunks are one of the primary predators of the honeybee, relying on their thick pet pets domestic domesticated fur to protect them from stings. The skunk scratches at the front of the beehive and eats the guard bees that come out to investigate. Mother skunks are known to teach this behavior to their young. Behavior Skunks are crepuscular and solitary animals when not breeding, though in the colder parts of their range, they may gather in communal dens for warmth. During the day, they shelter in burrows which they can dig with their powerful front claws. Males and females occupy overlapping home ranges through the greater part of the year, typically  for females and up to 20 km2 for males. Skunks are not true hibernators in the winter, but do den up for extended periods of time. However, they remain generally inactive and feed rarely, going through a dormant stage. Over winter, multiple females huddle together; males often den alone. Often, the same winter den is repeatedly used. Although they have excellent senses of smell and hearing, they have poor vision, being unable to see objects more than about 3 m away, making them vulnerable to death by road traffic. They are short-lived; their lifespan in the wild can reach seven years, with most living only up to a year. In captivity, they may live for up to 10 years. Reproduction A striped skunk kit Skunks mate in early spring and are polygynous, meaning that successful males mate with more than one female. Before giving birth (usually in May), the female excavates a den to house her litter of four to seven kits. They are placental, with a gestation period of about 66 days. When born, skunk kits are blind, deaf, and covered in a soft layer of fur. About three weeks after birth, their eyes open. The kits are weaned about two months after birth, but generally stay with their mother until they are ready to mate, at about one year of age. The mother is protective of her kits, spraying at any sign of danger. The male plays no part in raising the young Anal scent glands Skunks are notorious for their anal scent glands, which they can use as a defensive weapon. They are similar to, though much more developed than, the glands found in species of the Mustelidae family. Skunks have two glands, one on each side of the anus. These glands produce a mixture of sulfur-containing chemicals such as thiols, traditionally called mercaptans, which have a highly offensive smell. The odor of the fluid is strong enough to ward off bears and other potential attackers, and can be difficult to remove from clothing", "title": "Skunks nearly spray man", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T01:39:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uBMII-sccs", "description": "Sat Nam!\n\nIn this video you will learn how to do the Ego Eradicator using the breath of fire to help you turn down the volume of the ego and tune into the higher voice of the soul. \n\nVisit www.kundalliniyogasarah.com for more information\nLIKE on Facebook", "title": "Kundalini Yoga Sarah: Ego Eradicator Mediation", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T00:30:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uBXB98Hw2k", "description": "Funny shit", "title": "Halon", "publishedDate": "2006-08-15T23:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uBaYOE-bhc", "description": "The full audio track and other musical related material belongs solely to Adversity Vines.

This is a simple process and is very useful if you have found a nice font online that you want to use in a document.\n\nStep # 1 -- Downloading a Font\n\nTo install a new font in Windows you don't actually do it on a program by program basis. Instead you install a font to the computer which will be accessible to every program -- including InDesign. You need to find a font that you want to install, here you can see we have our web browser open at the popular free font site \"www.dafont.com\". Here we are just going to click \"Download\" for one of the front page fonts. A zip file will download to the computer.\n\nStep # 2 -- Installing the Font\n\nRight click on the arrow next to the downloaded file and in the menu that appears click \"Show in Folder\". A folder will open and you will see the zipped up font file. Right click on this and extract it using your preferred extraction software. You will see that a \".tff\" file has appeared -- this is our font. Right click on this and click \"Install\", a window will open briefly and the font will be installed to your machine.\n\nStep # 3 -- Adding the Font\n\nNow, to test this out, open InDesign and have a blank document open. Click on the text option and drag a box onto the screen. From the menu at the top, click into the font drop down box and locate and click on the font we just downloaded. Once it has been selected, type something onto the page. As you can see it is working nicely here and you can use this method to install any number of fonts you wish -- you now know how to add fonts to InDesign.", "title": "How to Add Fonts to inDesign", "publishedDate": "2013-09-11T08:47:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uEIoQ7b66Q", "description": "Well- grounded Vision Perseverance Origin\nFor more details: http://www.sk-crusher.com/\nContact us: http://www.sk-crusher.com/contactus.html\n\nShanghai Shunky Machinery Co.,Ltd.\nMay 1997\nAddress\uff1a1000 Jinhai Road, Pudong District, Shanghai,China\nZip\uff1a201206\nTEL\uff1a0086-21-66030377\nFax: 0086-21-66030508\nEmail:marketing@shunky.com \n\nShanghai Shunky Machinery Co.,ltd is a famous manufacturer of crushing and screening equipments in China.

Jay (Jason Mews) and Silent Bob (Smith) are a pair of stoned New Jersey slackers who have long been used as the templates for a pair of popular comic book heroes, Bluntman and Chronic. When they learn that their alter egos are to be turned into a major motion picture without their consent or compensation, the pair sets off for Hollywood to sabotage the production. Along the way, they encounter an ape, a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast of Scooby-Doo, a Charlie's Angels-style band of sexy women who use them as stool pigeons in a diamond heist, and an unhinged wildlife ranger (Will Ferrell). They also meet up with some regulars from the Smith canon, including Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks, Jason Lee as Banky Edwards, Alanis Morissette as God, and actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in dual roles as themselves and two other familiar characters. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back co-stars numerous other recognizable performers in roles of various sizes, including Shannen Doherty, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Shannon Elizabeth, Tracy Morgan, Judd Nelson, Chris Rock, and George Carlin, among others.\n\n\"will ferrell\",\"ben affleck\",\"jason mewes\",\"brian ohalloran\",\"jeff anderson\",\"jon stewart\",\"kevin smith\",\"cell phone videos\",\"television videos\",comedy,\"late night comedies\",\"showbiz comedies\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"laura greenlee\",\"jonathan gordon\",\"scott mosier\",\"communication videos\",\"rebellion videos\",\"convenience store videos\",\"newsroom videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++250563,/m/02q7z2,/m/0gd9k,/m/0151w_,/m/09594c,/m/063r24,/m/018grr,/m/01j7rd", "title": "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (6/12) Movie CLIP - The C.L.I.T.

Nathanson, David L. Wolper\nScreenwriter: James Ellroy, Brian Helgeland, Curtis Hanson\nFilm Description: Based on the best-selling novel by James Ellroy and directed by Curtis Hanson, this award-winning crime drama explores both the dark side of the Los Angeles police force and Southern California's criminal underbelly in the early '50s, when Hollywood was still seen as America's capital of sophistication, glitter, and glamour. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is the head of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye to violence or corruption within his department, as long as it's the \"bad guys\" who are getting hurt. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a police detective whose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of decency and justice. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is a beat cop-turned-detective whose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on other officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of the internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a flashy \"Hollywood\" detective who serves as technical advisor for the TV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito), publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws kickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz figures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn into a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple murder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle) to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. This lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography and call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose women are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well-known movie stars. White's role in the investigation is complicated when he falls for Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), one of Patchett's prostitutes, who is the spitting image of Veronica Lake. L.A. Confidential was nominated for nine Academy Awards and netted two, with Brian Helgeland honored for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Kim Basinger taking home a statuette as Best Supporting Actress.\n\n\"l.a. confidential\",\"l.a. confidential clip\",\"l.a. confidential full movie\",\"l.a. confidential part 1\",\"kevin spacey\",\"james cromwell\",\"gun videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"arnon milchan\",\"michael g nathanson\",\"curtis hanson\",\"dan kolsrud\",\"david l wolper\",\"brian helgeland\",\"evil videos\",\"kitchen videos\",\"dudley smith\",\"jack vincennes\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++154997,/m/024bbl,/m/048lv", "title": "L.A.

As a leader in technology, FDA trial research and surgical fellowships, Texas Back Institute remains dedicated to helping patients get back to life and rid of back problems once and for all.\n\n\"We believe it's time to take a look at how far we've come and what our team has been able to accomplish,\" said Dr. Richard Guyer, also a TBI founding partner. \"It's remarkable.\"\n\nAfter 35 years, Texas Back Institute has grown to include 22 physicians who practice in 14 offices throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Its reputation for spine research and patient care has been enhanced by many one-of-a-kind achievements, including:\n\n\u00b7 TBI physicians were the first to perform lumbar total disc replacement in the U.S.\n\u00b7 TBI physicians were the first to perform two level total disc replacement in the U.S.\n\u00b7 TBI physicians have performed the most lumbar and cervical total disc replacements in the U.S.\n\u00b7 TBI physicians pioneered many minimally invasive spine surgery techniques in the U.S.\n\u00b7 TBI physicians are actively enrolling patients in FDA-regulated studies for surgeries or technologies that  are currently only available outside the United States\n\nAlong the way, Texas Back Institute became the first institution in the United States to prescribe outpatient myelography, and led the first FDA study of the artificial disc. In 1985, the founders created the TBI Research Foundation to improve patient care through research and education. Today, TBI also trains orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons through an accredited Spine Surgery Fellowship Program.\n\nThese achievements, and many others, were celebrated by TBI during the 35th Anniversary reception in October at the DMA, located at 1717 North Harwood, in heart of the downtown Dallas art district.\n\n\"Even though we have made significant accomplishments, there is still more to come,\" said Dr. Ralph Raushbaum, M.D. and founding partner of TBI. \"The next 35 years will be amazing. This industry continues to innovate and we at TBI will continue to be on the leading edge of spine care.\"\n\nTo learn more about how Texas Back Institute can help you with your back problems, visit http://www.texasback.com", "title": "Back Problems | 35 Years of Excellence in Spine Care |Texas Back Institute | Plano Texas", "publishedDate": "2012-11-01T20:51:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ueR2GJsW2Y", "description": "Soundtrack from movie Levity - 2003", "title": "Levity - Soundtrack - Running The Bath", "publishedDate": "2010-06-03T10:51:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uem0iLBMD0", "description": "", "title": "streetbuck @boom na boom", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T06:30:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1uepHyBfvV8", "description": "\u30e9\u30a4\u30c1\uff24\uff25\u5149\u30af\u30e9\u30d6", "title": "Litchi DE Hikari Club - Epis\u00f3dio 06 (Legendado) PT BR", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T12:36:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ugDG62RObc", "description": "FREE DOWNLOAD: http://dipsomaniacrecords.bandcamp.com/album/premeditated\nTaken from the album, \"Premeditated\".

It is often played in the opera on the dizi, a popular Chinese transverse flute with a membrane. Purple Bamboo Melody is also often played as a solo piece or in small ensembles, and slightly different versions exist depending upon which instrument it is played. Todays version is being performed on the xiao and octave mandolin, which imitates the Chinese string instrument the jang. The xiao is a vertical notch flute which has a mellow tone. The modern xiao is a direct descendent of the ancient instrument, one of the earliest flutes in Asia, and from which the popular Japanese shakuhachi was derived from in the 8th Century.\n\u00a0\na film by cineman8\n\nHolly Cook has recently graduated with a Masters degree in performance at Trinity College of Music, where she was awarded a Leverhulme Orchestral Mentorship Award for study. Holly studied flute with Anna Noakes and ethnic flutes with Andy Findon and Tony Hinnigan. Her specialist area of study was ethnic flute music, upon which she wrote a dissertation and made a recording of a contemporary Japanese influenced piece of flute music, gaining a distinction for this. As part of her training, Holly undertook a Mentor Scheme placement with the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Ileana Ruheman. Holly has recently been featured in Muso magazine in an interview as a member of the contemporary flute octet Ayre Flutes.
