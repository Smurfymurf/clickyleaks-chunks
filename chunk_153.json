All 3 have a cavity and are placed in a tray of water. One of the raw potatoes and the cooked one have  salt filled in their cavities. The cavity in the other raw potato is left empty. When the potatoes are observed some time later, the salt in the raw potato is dissolved in water, while the salt in the cooked potato is still in the solid form with no water. The 3rd potato is without water. What happened here is like this. Because of osmosis, the cells of the potato surrounding the salt filled cavity gave out water into the cavity. This water is drawn from the water lying in the tray. The  cooked potato  cells are dead and so do not undergo osmosis. So no water is drawn in and the salt remains dry. In the case of the 3rd potato, as there is no salt, the cells do not develop sufficient osmotic pressure to draw in water..", "title": "Potato experiment | Osmosis | Biology", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T06:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8e080ADJX5g", "description": "Fogg Dam, NT, Australia", "title": "Lotus Lily or Sacred Lotus - Nelumbo nucifera bubbling.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-05-28T06:32:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8e0GUVwNkNY", "description": "This is my 1st time uploaded video.

It was already enough having to par take in this ridiculous debutante ball, but mother wanted to marry me off to some rich fool who hadn't a clue onto treat a lady let alone love her good and proper. Letting a sigh escape my slight pout I turned to Cousin Kevin. \"I'm sorry to be a downer on your plan Cousin but I am in no mood for any sort of surprises; maybe another time.\"\n\nGiving me one of his ridiculous smiles he placed both hands on my shoulders shaking his head slight most likely due to the stubbornness I had inherited from none other than mother herself. \"Selena, I can assure you that this particular surprise will surely bring a smile onto you beautiful face.\"\n\n\"Kevin, after the events that have just taken place I feel as if anything remotely exciting will only get me more agitated with myself.\"\n\n\"Ah, well then come along and prove me wrong. I am not taking no for an answer and that is final.\" Turning me around, he gently pushed me along the halls of the house until we reached our garden. The day after tomorrow would mark the day of the anniversary of its structure. It was absolutely magnificent with the many flowers blooming illuminating colors that not even van Gogh could create. Taking in the many perfumes of the budding flowers I smiled at the many memories this specific location held.\n\n\"Well lo and behold, if it isn't the infamous Selena Laston. In all her glory.\" That voice, the one voice that could brighten any dark day of mine, the voice I became to miss after he had left the house.\n\n\"My, my, my Nicholas, haven't you grown out to be a handsome thing. I bet ever girl is lining up to just get a glance at any chance of a smile.\"\n\n\"Ah, you should know me better than that Miss. Laston, I do not shed a smile on just any occasion.\"  Breaking out into a full out sprint I lunged myself into his warm embrace just relishing in his arms.\n\nAs we stood there in one another's embrace I couldn't help but think back to the last moment I had saw him. He had just been sent off to boarding school in New York; much to his protest. Both mother and his father thought it would be best, you could say he wasn't the most behaved among us. But judging by his appearance it had done him some good both physically and mentally.\n\n\"My god Selena how I have missed you letters just don't cut it anymore.\" I knew exactly how he felt. Two years with him not by my side had grown unbearable but, all was good in the world now that my best friend from childhood was back at home.\n\n\"I missed you too Nicholas, so much.\" Words would begin to fail the amount I truly had missed him. He had consumed much of my life while he was still here, and yet when he was gone he was honestly all I thought about.\n\nPulling out of his warm and sweet embrace I smiled up at him as all seemed right with the world. \"How long are you staying in Vermont for?\"\n\nBrushing a stray hand away from my face he cupped the side of my face gently giving me one of his rare breathtaking smiles. \"I'm hoping for forever. If that's okay with you.\"\n\nNodding slightly, I gave into his soft touch wanting more of his warmth. \"I wouldn't have it any other way Nicholas.\"\n\nGiving me a small peck on my forehead, I pulled him tighter to my body not wanting to let go. \"I was hoping you would say that.\"\n\nI am unbelievably excited for The Vow to come out!

The olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous, especially in immature stages of the life cycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or estuarine habitats. Common prey items include jellyfish, tunicates, sea urchins, bryozoans, bivalves, snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. Sphoeroides) and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding . The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources . Captive studies have indicated some level of cannibalistic behavior in this species.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Today I'm going to show you a cable lower chest raise. Many of you have asked how do we work on the lower part of the pec. I definitely am not a fan of decline bench exercises and decline dumbbells because of the stress they put on your shoulders. But, when we come to a cable, we don't have to worry about that. \n\nWhat we do is pull from below us forward and we're working the under part of our chest. Remember, from back and below us up to about our chest position is the lower part of your chest. If you decide you want to come higher as you're moving you're switching it into upper pec and shoulder again. So, if your focus is just the lower part of the pec you'll stop right at chest height. Let me show you how that works. \n\nI step forward on one leg. This is my dominant leg. This back one is going to be my stabilizer. I'm coming from behind the midline of my body, contracting my chest as we are here, pulling forward, pause. This is the end of our lower chest raise exercise on the cable machine. Let's go through a couple of reps. Slow back, contracting as you're pulling forward, pause. Slow on the way down, slow on the way forward, pause. \n\nOne thing you've got to pay attention to is you never release the tension on your arms. Even when you're coming back to your very back position there's going to be tension here. It's never going to be soft and loose. Always maintain that tension, and you're always working your chest muscles. \n\nSlow on the way up again, pause at chest height. Slow on the way back, and pause.\n\nOne tip I have for you on the cable lower chest raise is it's all dependent on you how much force and how much tension you're going to put into your pec muscle. Obviously, as I'm pulling forward I'm contracting before I even move my arms up. That will give you a much deeper recruitment of muscle fibers in the lower part of your chest. \n\nRemember, you are contracting from the bottom, pausing here, squeezing, squeezing, also keeping that contraction as you let your arms back. More work, better results. \n\nThat is the lower chest raise on the cable machine.

Flowers are papery and will reach up to 6.5 cm across. Flowers come in shades of yellow, orange, reds and whites. They are very showy.  http://www.plantoftheweek.org/week446.shtml \n\nWhen cut young and dried, the open flowers and stalks preserve both colour and shape indefinitely. Harvest when the flowers are only partially open, (when 2 to 3 layers of petals have opened, they continue to open as they dry. Immediately, hang the flowers by the stem upside down in small bunches, in a dry, dark, open, airy place  - the colour tends to fade if they are dried in the light.  http://www.seedaholic.com/helichrysum-bracteatum-king-size-formula-mixed.html \n\nInsects  filmed with Panasonic Lumix DMC- TZ20 camera \n\nSorry, but the video is not always on focus.\n\nHelicrysum bracteatum -  Eil\u00edf\u00f0arbl\u00f3m  - S\u00f3largull \n\nXerochrysum bracteatum -  commonly known as the Golden Everlasting, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Australia. Described by \u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat in 1803, it was known as -  Helichrysum bracteatum  - for many years before being transferred to a new genus Xerochrysum in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre (3 ft) tall with green or grey leafy foliage. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery bracts that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of habitats across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans, butterflies and moths, and adult butterflies, hoverflies, native bees, small beetles and grasshoppers visit the flower heads. The golden everlasting has proven very adaptable to cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars in a host of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerochrysum_bracteatum\n\nUnfortunately handheld, with such a macro and a minuscule depth of field the video is shaky and not always on focus.

Cicadas are in the superfamily Cicadoidea. Their eyes are prominent, though not especially large, and set wide apart on the anterior lateral corners of the frons. The wings are well-developed, with conspicuous veins; in some species the wing membranes are wholly transparent, whereas in many others the proximal parts of the wings are clouded or opaque and some have no significantly clear areas on their wings at all. About 2,500 species of cicada have been described, and many remain to be described. Cicadas live in temperate-to-tropical climates where they are among the most-widely recognized of all insects, mainly due to their large size and unique sound. Cicadas are often colloquially called locusts, although they are unrelated to true locusts, which are various species of swarming grasshopper. Cicadas are related to leafhoppers and spittlebugs.\n\nCicadas are benign to humans under normal circumstances and do not bite or sting in a true sense, but may mistake a person's arm or other part of their body for a tree or plant limb and attempt to feed. Cicadas have a long proboscis, under their head, which they insert into plant stems in order to feed on sap. It can be painful if they attempt to pierce a person's skin with it, but it is unlikely to cause other harm. It is unlikely to be a defensive reaction and is a rare occurrence.

Jesus is a Prophet of Islam, yet a God of Christianity. In Islam God is all Powerful, But in Christianity God was overpowered and crucified on the cross, how can the Almighty God be overpowered, these are just examples for people to think about, we are not forcing you to believe, just ponder and question. The Quran is the final testament, Muhammad is the final Messenger. Islam is the final religion, so no I dont Hate Islam. One God, One God only, He does not beget nor was he begotten, He is the GREATEST. And has no partners. (Holy Quran Ch 112)\nThe following is a video response to bball1989_s video _Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word_. \n_And they say: the Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a Son. Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing, whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall to ruins, that ye ascribe to the Beneficent a son, when it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should chose a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave._ (Qur_an 19:88-93).\nI point out the false reasoning in the poem, and give some good reasons (there are more) to not believe his point.

If you want to defend your views and beliefs please do, but please do it in such a way that will shine a light on your beliefs and not embarrass them. I struggled with whether I should even upload this video or not, but I prayed about it, and you obviously can see the outcome of that. One World, One Love, One God.\n(While I appreciate all the Bible quotes, you must respect my belief to question the absoluteness of quotations that have been translated from their original language and passed down from generation to generation by flawed men. If the Bible is truly God_s word, why are there different versions of the Bible?

Armistice Day has come and gone, but the nation is still reeling from the ravages of the First World War.\n\nIn a sweeping story of social and emotional conflict, female academic Alexandra Milton is ousted from a tranquil university to work in a small, post-war Scottish town. Her task is to archive a unique bequest of seventeenth-century Spanish documents, but she is attacked by a mysterious intruder. A thief, or is the incident linked to the eccentric benefactress and her mysterious past?\n\nMeanwhile, demobbed soldiers pour back from France in their thousands, but there are no jobs. Town and city are fraught with tension and resentment, which Alexandra struggles to ignore. As she researches a rare volume of satirical interludes, censored at the time for provoking political and religious dissent, she finds eerie similarities with the harsh realities of post-war Britain. To aid her research, she seeks help from the local solicitor. She is drawn to him, but he seems plagued by his own demons and keeps his distance.\n\nSoon convinced that the benefactress died in mysterious circumstances, Alexandra puts aside her personal misgivings and conflicting feelings and digs deeper, despite the fact that she suspects she is being watched. Using her wits to solve the strangest of puzzles, she is drawn back to Glasgow, but then the dockworkers vote to strike. Fearing a revolution as bloody as the recent violence in Russia and Germany, the nation holds its breath as battle lines are drawn. Flung out of her safe world into the turbulent city, Alexandra finds herself at the heart of the maelstrom and must rely on old friends and new allies to avert political disaster. \n\nBuy it on Amazon - http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=Dark%20Interlude%20Pamela%20Kelt", "title": "Dark Interlude by Pamela Kelt: book trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T22:53:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8evrHUcYeY8", "description": "Goyangan Nikita Mirzani yang membuat pria kelepek - kelepek", "title": "Nikita Mirzani - Goyangan Seksi", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T13:00:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8evwEHcPnXI", "description": "El director del Centro de la Patolog\u00eda de la mama, Armando Tejerina nos aclara todas las dudas acerca de la protecci\u00f3n frente al c\u00e1ncer de mama de la lactancia materna.\n\nEncuentra toda la informaci\u00f3n sobre el c\u00e1ncer de mama en http://www.guiainfantil.com/tags/cancer-de-mama/\nPuedes ver m\u00e1s videos relacionados con el c\u00e1ncer demama, la edad y la fertilidad en la lista de reproducci\u00f3n http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=3F3F1E64788B2DC4\nGuiainfantil.com en colaboraci\u00f3n con la fundaci\u00f3n Tejerina http://www.cpm-tejerina.com/", "title": "\u00bfPuede la lactancia disminuir las posibilidades de un c\u00e1ncer de mama?", "publishedDate": "2011-04-13T10:38:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ewCHRzlmf4", "description": "Bull is launching a new range of bullion\u2122 servers designed to speed up the implementation of Big Data and private Cloud infrastructures.

Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an Irish tennis player with an impoverished background. Just accomplished enough to make his way onto the professional circuit, but not skilled enough to be a consistent winner, he now works as an instructor at a London tennis club. The wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who is as impressed by Chris's charm and good looks as he is by his game, takes a tennis lesson from the young man. Chris's intelligence and wit also make a strong impression on Tom's pretty sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who soon falls for him. It isn't long before Chris and Chloe are engaged to be married, a match that pleases both Tom and his father, Alec (Brian Cox), a successful businessman who believes Chris has a bright future in his firm. However, Chris also feels an overwhelming attraction to Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sexy blonde from the United States who is dating Tom. Though Nola initially puts up some resistance, Chris gently nudges her in the direction of an affair. Passion soon ignites between the two, and they have a one-time sexual encounter, even as Chris and Chloe plan their wedding.

R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker) is the ruthless head of Travi-Com, a telecommunications firm on the cusp of a major breakthrough in laser communications technology. However, Travis needs diamonds to finish the project, so he sends a group of men to Zaire, where he's told that a large supply of the gems can be easily found. When the men go missing, Travis sends his trusted assistant Karen Ross (Laura Linney), a one-time CIA associate, into the jungle to find both his staff and the jewels. Hoping to keep her mission a secret, Karen travels to Zaire in the company of Peter (Dylan Walsh), a researcher on primate development who is hoping to return Amy, a gorilla who has been taught sign language and can \"speak\" English with the help of a glove-controlled computer device. Also travelling with them is Herkermer (Tim Curry), a Romanian with a secret agenda: he's convinced that Amy can guide him to the Lost City of Zinj, where he believes that King Solomon's Mines are located. Upon arrival, the group is met by Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson), a self-described \"great white hunter who happens to be black,\" and they discover that the jungle holds a menace that they weren't counting on: a tribe of bloodthirsty gray gorillas.

Yeshayahu 66).\n\n4) We can realize that Talmud is dangerous in general (cf. Yirimiyahu 8:8; also, from the Talmud itself, 'Eruvin 21b and Bava Metzi'a 59b), despite what good gems it has (e.g., how Hanukkah has been celebrated is codified in Shabbat 21b. Hanukkah is also mentioned in Yochanahn 10). \n\nLinks:\n\n1) https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+8&version=NKJV;OJB;CJB\n\n2) https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%208&version=NKJV;OJB;CJB (Compare Nechemyah 8 to Vayikra 23. Nechemyah, one of Rabbincal Judaism's forerunner's, definitely added to and took from Tanakh.)\n\n3) http://scheinerman.net/judaism/chanukah/texts.html \n\n4) http://www.reformjudaism.org/how-do-orthodox-and-reform-practices-differ (Rabbi Scheinerman, like my friend re Nehemiah 8:15, sadly equated Tanakh and Talmud just because of Talmud. In other words, e.g., Nechemyah 8:13-15 and Ezra 10 tell us that Nechemyah and Ezra added to Tanakh. That doesn't negate \"Sola Scriptura\"/\"Raq Tanakh\", though.)\n\n5) [The link that I forgot before] https://twitter.com/DavidRomeiPHD/status/516792664113811456", "title": "Why Jews Need To Make Mass Aliyah (Aliyah HaG'dolah)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T22:34:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8fcXt7gH0j0", "description": "", "title": "Prone Shoulder Rotation", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T19:39:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8fctFZBp9xw", "description": "This Poem Is The Original Work And Property Of Cortney Joseph . 2013. \u00a9\n(Originally written & posted in 2012)\nShare, Like, Comment, Subscribe!!\nFollow me : @CortSoPoetic\nFollow me : oh-cortney.tumblr.com", "title": "It's Over (Spoken Word) | @WrittenByCort", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11T04:43:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8fd-LGCCoYI", "description": "Truth where we may find it:\nShort, sleepy rant before heading over to an art festival. \nWhy am I so sleepy? \nIs it the toxic soup we live in?\nAnd, BLOOPER, I said I can't reply to comments on FACEBOOK,  meant YouTube.

Es considerado uno de los padres de la Ciencia de la computaci\u00f3n siendo el precursor de la inform\u00e1tica moderna. Proporcion\u00f3 una influyente formalizaci\u00f3n de los conceptos de algoritmo y computaci\u00f3n: la m\u00e1quina de Turing. Formul\u00f3 su propia versi\u00f3n de la hoy ampliamente aceptada Tesis de Church-Turing, la cual postula que cualquier modelo computacional existente tiene las mismas capacidades algor\u00edtmicas, o un subconjunto, de las que tiene una m\u00e1quina de Turing. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, trabaj\u00f3 en romper los c\u00f3digos nazis, particularmente los de la m\u00e1quina Enigma; durante un tiempo fue el director de la secci\u00f3n Naval Enigma del Bletchley Park. Tras la guerra dise\u00f1\u00f3 uno de los primeros computadores electr\u00f3nicos programables digitales en el Laboratorio Nacional de F\u00edsica del Reino Unido y poco tiempo despu\u00e9s construy\u00f3 otra de las primeras m\u00e1quinas en la Universidad de M\u00e1nchester. Entre otras muchas cosas, tambi\u00e9n contribuy\u00f3 de forma particular e incluso provocativa al enigma de si las m\u00e1quinas pueden pensar, es decir a la Inteligencia Artificial.\n\nLa carrera de Turing termin\u00f3 s\u00fabitamente cuando fue procesado por su condici\u00f3n de homosexual. No se defendi\u00f3 de los cargos y se le dio a escoger entre la castraci\u00f3n qu\u00edmica o ir a la c\u00e1rcel.

He has become increasingly concerned about the impacts of salmon farming.\n\nBelow is what Roddy has written to those in the industry and the letter that triggered the alarm for him that there's more to impacts of salmon farming than meets the eye.\n\n\"Having worked for smaller fish farms in the 80's and having been fishing commercially for 20+ years, I can say this; until 2011 I had personally never had anything to say against fish farming. But that has changed and one reason it changed is because of the following letter from a fisherman over here on the Outer Hebrides, as copied below. If any one wishes direct any comments to about the letter then I'd be more than happy to respond with some of the events which followed the incident in Loch Shell. I hope some fish farmers can also comment, I for one am very open to discussing the current issues with those working in the industry. Here's the letter;\n\nThe Registry\nSEPA\nGraesser House\nFodderty Way\nDingwall\nIV15 9XB\n\nYour Ref: CAR/L/1001802 (Pairc A & B Mid Loch Shell)\n\n18 November 2010\n\nDear Sir/Madam\n\nI wish to OBJECT to the proposal by Marine Harvest Scotland Ltd (MHSL) to modify the site and chemical treatments used at Loch Shell, Isle of Lewis. I am one of a number of fishermen who work in Loch Shell and strongly believe that the operations MHSL are having an adverse effect on the environment and other users of the Loch.\n\nCoinciding with sea lice treatments during the last fish cycle in Loch Shell, Nephrops stocks of all age classes in areas above the fishfarm collapsed. Initially I found dying and dead prawns in the creels close to the fishfarm. A neighbouring fisherman in the area also hauled a fleet with five dead lobsters. Soon it was not only the Nephrops that were disappearing, all other fauna, such as the tiny crabs, that usually come up on creels had also gone over an area stretching from the fish farm towards the head of Loch Shell. The loss of this area has significantly damaged our family income. There was nothing unusual noted in other areas where I fish.\n\nI contacted SEPA and asked them to investigate. During discussion SEPA confirmed that the treatment for sea lice undertaken by Marine Harvest during the last cycle was very high in quantity and frequency. Clearly MHSL had underestimated the sea lice problems they would encounter in the loch.\n\nSEPA tests found Cypermethrin at a level of 1.24 ug/Kg and Emamectin Benzoate at a level of 1.31 ug/Kg in an area outside of the AZE. In addition during a meeting with Stuart Baird I was told that MHSL had not submitted returns to SEPA for Cypermethrin during this period. SEPA also took away some dead and dying prawns from creels outside the lease area, hauled while they were testing.\n\nI have occasionally tried fishing the area again but it has remained 'sterile', only now are animals gradually returning. These are typically mobile species such as crabs and starfish. There are no significant signs of Nephrops returning as yet and it will clearly be some time, before any commercially viable stocks reappear if indeed at all.\n\nI am therefore absolutely opposed to the expansion in tonnage or area of the sites or any increase in the use of chemicals in Loch Shell. I believe it will cause long term damage to the environment and threaten the livelihood of fishermen who are dependent on Loch Shell including myself.\n\nLoch Shell is clearly a poor site for a fish farm if treatment activities within permitted levels result in such a disastrous effect. I am also concerned that by reducing stocking densities the Freedom Food initiative is actually increasing the area of fishfarms and the amount of chemicals required to reduce sealice using bath treatments. This increases the impact of the fish farms on the surrounding environment and crustacean fisheries.\n\nAccordingly I request that planning conditions are set out to bring about an absolute reduction in the bath treatments allowed in Loch Shell from the previous growing cycle. Further I request that planning conditions are also put in place that guarantee long term post authorisation sampling monitoring by SEPA to ensure that treatment authorisations are being observed and to determine if these levels impact on marine life in Loch Shell. This could include using techniques such as biomonitors and sediment analysis. The cumulative impact of the Loch Shell sites and the neighboring site nearer Lemreway should also be considered.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to respond to this application.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nDonald Macleod\n\nc.c.

One symptom that Reese used to experience was excessive, uncontrollable drooling. This excessive saliva increased Reese's chances of getting sick and also of aspiration, or choking. It also impacted his social interactions with his family and friends. After talking with doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Reese's parents decided that he would undergo a minimally invasive salivary gland ablation procedure performed by Dr. Shiels (bio here: http://bit.ly/1c5DObR). The salivary gland ablation procedure is performed by injecting drugs into the major salivary glands (submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands), causing the salivary gland tissue to shrivel up and turn to scar tissue. Reese had a handful of these procedures and has had a great outcome. His drooling has reduced remarkably - in fact, it's basically non-existent - and he continues to live a happy, active life!\n\nLearn more about the procedure (here: http://bit.ly/1c5DLgk) and the recovery process (here: http://bit.ly/1c5DPwl).

Brain cells and their function are greatly influenced by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential components of cell membrane phospholipids in the brain that are crucial to normal function. This study assessed the effect of chronic fish oil (FO) supplementation (rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) on behavior and oxidative stress of Wistar rats subjected to HE due to a liver failure caused by thioacetamide (TAA) intoxication. The FO supplementation started in an early phase of brain development, that is, at the 21st day of life, and extended to the 122th day of life. The results indicated that cognitive function, specifically spatial memory, was markedly affected in the group that received TAA. Most notably, the ill effects caused by TAA administration were counteracted by FO supplementation. In addition to behavioral improvements, FO also promoted reduction in levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and superoxide dismutase activity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In summary, FO protected against spatial memory deficits and oxidative stress caused by HE in rats subjected to liver lesion due to TAA intoxication. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanism underlying FO behaviors in rats subjected to encephalopathy.\n\nFor more information please visit: http://www.benthamscience.com/contents.php?in=107966&m=February&y=2013", "title": "'Fish Oil has Beneficial Effects on Behavior Impairment and Oxidative Stress' by Dr. Anete", "publishedDate": "2013-12-30T09:52:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gcb5eAuJls", "description": "", "title": "Museta XXII  bach", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T16:49:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gcikfNngA0", "description": "Subscribe for new episodes: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=farmraisedchannel\n\nIf you asked Allen which of his chickens produces the most eggs, he would tell you without hesitation: his stunning White Leghorns.

Agent is compensated for videos\n\nThe Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is a milkweed butterfly (subfamily Danainae), in the family Nymphalidae. It is perhaps the best known of all North American butterflies. Since the 19th century, it has been found in New Zealand, and in Australia since 1871 where it is called the Wanderer.[3][4][5] It is resident in the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira, and is found as an occasional migrant in Western Europe and a rare migrant in the United Kingdom where it is called the Milkweed [1]. Its wings feature an easily recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.9--10.2 centimetres (3\u00bd--4 in).[6] (The Viceroy butterfly has a similar size, color, and pattern, but can be distinguished by an extra black stripe across the hind wing.) Female Monarchs have darker veins on their wings, and the males have a spot called the \"androconium\" in the center of each hind wing[7] from which pheromones are released. Males are also slightly larger.\n \nThe Monarch is famous for its southward migration and northward return in summer from Canada to Mexico and Baja California which spans the life of three to four generations of the butterfly.\n\nSearch for historic home for sale or downtown Austin Condo TX at http://www.downtownaustincondosforsale.com\n\nMonarch Butterfly \n\nPrudential Texas Realty REALTOR\u00ae, Austin Real Estate Expert Perry Henderson, MBA http://www.perryhenderson.com 512.791.7462\n\nMonarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus)", "title": "Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-22T21:10:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gftj8m6nJM", "description": "Watch more How to Play Basketball videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/499757-How-to-Dribble-through-Legs-as-You-Run-Basketball\n\nLearn how to do a through the legs layup basketball trick from the Harlem Wizards in this Howcast basketball video.\n\n\n[music]\n\nBroadway, you know I like gettin' fancy out here on 'em.

Each amino acid has both a three-letter symbol and a single-letter symbol. For example, the three-letter and single-letter symbols for alanine are Ala and A. The three-letter symbols (such as Ala) are much more widely used than the single letter ones (such as A).\n\nTherefore, the following list is limited to the three-letter symbols and is further limited to those 20 alpha-amino acids specified by the genetic code: \nAlanine: Ala\nArginine: Arg\nAsparagine: Asn\nAspartic acid: Asp\nCysteine: Cys\nGlutamic acid: Glu\nGlutamine: Gln\nGlycine: Gly\nHistidine: His\nIsoleucine: Ile\nLeucine: Leu\nLysine: Lys\nMethionine: Met\nPhenylalanine: Phe\nProline: Pro\nSerine: Ser\nThreonine: Thr\nTryptophan: Trp\nTyrosine: Tyr\nValine: Val\n\nThese three-letter symbols for amino acids are used not only to refer to an individual amino acid but also to present the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide or a protein. For example, part of the sequence of insulin reads: Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-Ala-Ser-Val. The N-terminal residue of the polypeptide or protein is by convention always on the left and the sequence reads from left-to-right toward the C-terminal residue of the polypeptide or protein. \n\n\n\n\n\nmedical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "What Is The Definition Of Amino acid symbols Medical Dictionary Free Online", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T21:12:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gjSFT6nVrE", "description": "Having some fun slinging arrows, shooting multiple targets, beer cans all at different yardages.

Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.[1] Due to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can only be found within hadrons.[2][3] For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.\n\nThere are six types of quarks, known as flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom.[4] Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas charm, strange, top, and bottom quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators).\n\nQuarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, color charge, spin, and mass. Quarks are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge. For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.\n\nThe quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964.[5] Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC in 1968.[6][7] All six flavors of quark have since been observed in accelerator experiments; the top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered", "title": "Protons and neutrons are made of Quarks", "publishedDate": "2011-07-19T13:34:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gq7pw3Nypk", "description": "While speaking in Las Vegas on Thursday, Hillary Clinton had a shoe thrown at her.", "title": "Watch Hillary Clinton dodge a shoe on stage", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T23:21:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gqH6QMACAk", "description": "Buy now, iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/judaa/id481131721\nClick to subscribe - http://bit.ly/EnVyWw\n\nEnvy Entertainment Proudly Presents \nSong: Yaarian \nSinger: Amrinder Gill \nAlbum: Judaa (Brand New Album) \nMusic: Dr. Zeus \nFeaturing: Shortie \nLabel: Envy Worldwide | http://www.EnvyWorldwide.com \nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/Envyworldwide\n\nFollow & Subscribe us now!\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/EnVySb | Soundcloud: http://bit.ly/EnVySc \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/EnVyTw | Googleplus: http://bit.ly/EnVyGp\n\nAmrinder Gill... is one of the most successful Punjabi vocalists of the this decade, famous for his lush voice, soulful and romantic ballads. \nWorld renowed Punjabi artist Amrinder Gill ,whose smooth, silky voice has given soul to songs about life, love and relationships. \nHis voice quivers in the silence.

It is estimated to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members as of 2012.\n\nThe first Ku Klux Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. Members adopted white costumes: robes, masks, and conical hats, designed to be outlandish and terrifying, and to hide their identities.[14] The second KKK flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, and adopted the same costumes and code words as the first Klan, while introducing cross burnings.[15] The third KKK emerged after World War II and was associated with opposing the Civil Rights Movement and progress among minorities. The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent reference to the USA's \"Anglo-Saxon\" blood, harking back to 19th-century nativism and claiming descent from the original 18th-century British colonial revolutionaries.[16] Though most members of the KKK saw themselves in holding to American values and Christian morality, virtually every Christian denomination officially denounced the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nEPS 24\n\n\nFor Licensing:\n\nGlobal ImageWorks, LLC., \n65 Beacon Street \nHaworth, New Jersey 07641 \n\ninfo@globalimageworks.com \ntelephone: 201-384-7715 \nfax: 201-501-8971", "title": "KKK Cross Burnings", "publishedDate": "2014-05-28T02:35:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gqXQOSVUrs", "description": "This piece of music ( a lullaby ) originates from the island of Mauritius \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIG03HT21V8 has the words of the song.", "title": "Mauritian lullaby : \" Mo passer la Riviere Tanier  \"", "publishedDate": "2012-09-24T03:47:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8gq_2a8lOnA", "description": "Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon try to land a toy plane on an aircraft carrier which results in a lot of toy plane crashes.

The black tidal wave demolished properties in its path and engulfed the Pantglas Junior School in seconds. Of the 144 people who lost their lives that day, 116 were children. The tragedy was totally preventable. The National Coal Board had been warned time and time again of the dangers of dumping slag in such a geologically unstable area above towns. They chose to ignore the warnings claiming it wan't profitble for them to move the slag tips to safer locations. After the disaster, donations from all over the world poured in for the shattered community. However, most of the money never reached Aberfan. Instead the Governmen gave it to the National Coal Boad so that they could move other slag tips overlooking other towns in South Wales.\n\nThe great Welsh writer and broadcaster Gwyn Thomas delivered his own moving tribute to the victims of the tragedy on the BBC the morning of the mass funeral.

What he discovers turns out to be what he least wants to know: the inner workings of his parents' lives. And even then he can't stop searching. Miles Adler-Hart starts eavesdropping to find out what his mother is planning for his life. When he learns instead that his parents are separating, his investigation deepens, and he enlists his best friend, Hector, to help. \n\nBoth boys are in thrall to Miles's unsuspecting mother, Irene, who is \"pretty for a mathematician.\" They rifle through her dresser drawers, bug her telephone lines, and strip-mine her computer, only to find that all clues lead them to her bedroom, and put them on the trail of a mysterious stranger from Washington, D.C. Their amateur detective work starts innocently but quickly takes them to the far reaches of adult privacy as they acquire knowledge that will affect the family's well-being, prosperity, and sanity. \nBurdened with this powerful information, the boys struggle to deal with the existence of evil and concoct modes of revenge on their villains that are both hilarious and na\u00efve. Eventually, haltingly, they learn to offer animal comfort to those harmed and to create an imaginative path to their own salvation. \n\nCasebook brilliantly reveals an American family both coming apart at the seams and, simultaneously, miraculously reconstituting itself to sustain its members through their ultimate trial.

Nelle campagne infuria la pellagra, mentre in citt\u00e0 le luci dei quartieri pi\u00f9 signorili e ricchi stridono per contrasto con la bolgia del Portello, la zona pi\u00f9 popolare e malfamata della citt\u00e0. Ed \u00e8 proprio qui, al Portello, che al termine di una notte nevosa, viene ritrovato il cadavere straziato di una prostituta.\nL'ispettore Roberto Pastrello capisce che le sue forze non basteranno a risolvere il caso e decide di chiedere la collaborazione di due detective d'eccezione. Il giornalista investigativo Giorgio Fanton, massimo esperto del Portello, e il famoso criminologo Alexander Weisz, intuitivo, tormentato, affascinante, con una pelle bianchissima e lunghi capelli neri.\nDa quando, bambino, ha trovato sua madre uccisa da un assassino misterioso, Weisz ha giurato che non avrebbe mai pi\u00f9 permesso che a una donna venisse fatto del male. Ma il trauma dell'infanzia gli ha lasciato anche una pericolosa dipendenza dal laudano... Dopo qualche riluttanza l'irruente Fanton, allegro e conviviale, molto abile nelle risse, e Weisz, geniale e anticonformista, trovano accordo e affiatamento, aiutati non solo dall'ispettore Pastrello, ma anche da Erendira, meravigliosa gitana, cartomante e prostituta, avvolta nel mistero dei suoi occhi blu in cui \u00e8 impossibile non perdersi. L'assassino, per\u00f2, non si ferma, continua a colpire finch\u00e9 Weisz non coglie un primo collegamento negli omicidi: tutte le vittime hanno il nome di un fiore...\n\nDopo il successo dei due romanzi della saga di Mila, Matteo Strukul torna e stupisce i lettori con un thriller storico eccezionale. Il ritmo travolgente di una narrazione modernissima \u00e8 immerso nelle atmosfere inquietanti e gotiche della Padova di fine '800, che portano alla mente quelle, celebri e dark, della Londra vittoriana. Il lettore assiste alla grande lotta tra il male, che si incarna in un terribile serial killer, l'Angelo Sterminatore, e il bene, rappresentato da una coppia di detective insofferenti alle regole che ricordano Holmes e Watson nella recente trasposizione cinematografica di Guy Ritchie. Un romanzo senza eguali in Italia, che pu\u00f2 essere avvicinato alle opere dei grandi autori \"irregolari\" angloamericani, da Joe R. Lansdale a Alan Moore. \n \nUn assassino terribile e spietato.

Calhoun and others who just thought slavery was the best kind of system and should be permanent.\u00a0 But even within the anti-slavery spectrum, you had these abolitionists in one end, and on the other end, you had people who believed who wanted to get rid of slavery but thought it will be a long, long process.\u00a0 Lincoln once said it will take 100 years to get rid of slavery, and they couldn't really conceive blacks being members of American society.\u00a0 They talked of gradual emancipation of paying the owners for their slaves, and very often of colonizing them outside of the country.\u00a0 Lincoln starts out at that end of the spectrum, but during his life, in particular in Civil War, he moves toward the abolitionists' position.\u00a0 By the end of the Civil War, he's obviously presiding over the immediate abolition of slavery with no compensation, no payment to slave owners even though slaves legally a property.\u00a0 And at the very end of his life, he's talking for the first time publicly of giving the right to vote to at least some African-Americans in the South, so that's a whole different picture than sending them out of the country.\u00a0 Now, they're going to be there as part of the political system.\u00a0 So, what's interesting to me about Lincoln is how he moves along that spectrum.\u00a0 Too many people take one moment in Lincoln's career or one letter or one speech and they say, \"There is Lincoln,\" but you can't pin him down at one spot.\u00a0 That's part of his greatness.\u00a0 He grows.\u00a0 He changes.\u00a0 In a period of radical change, he himself is able to, you know, rethink his ideas.\u00a0 And many presidents, including some recent ones, aren't able to rethink even when, you know, events seem to suggest they may be on the wrong track.", "title": "Eric Foner Sets Us Straight on Lincoln and Slavery", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T01:42:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hQiOxZmUhQ", "description": "Geta Burlacu voce music lyrics\nSandu Gorgos aranjament", "title": "Daruiam Dor Geta Burlacu", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T20:27:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hQwP1p8sL8", "description": "BNSF 8412 and CREX 1414 lead an eastbound coal train at Chariton, IA on BNSF's Ottumwa Sub.

Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year, thereby differing from such permanently horned animals as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may be superficially similar. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded to be deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively. Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native species, the red deer, confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that fawn fawns deer like to eat. frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive. Small species of brocket deer and pud\u00fas of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian Muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America's Andes fill an ecological niche of the ibex or wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids. The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn antelope", "title": "Friendly Baby Deer Lost His Mom And Wants Us To Be His Parents", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T12:17:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hWtU68OKcE", "description": "The NYPD is undergoing an internal investigation after a suspect died within an hour of being put in an apparent chokehold.\n\nFollow : http://www.twitter.com/\nSee more at http://www.newsy.com \n\nSources: \nThe Daily News http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-man-dies-puts-choke-hold-article-1.1871486 \nLos Angeles Times http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-nypd-choking-death-20140718-story.html \nThe New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html \nU.S. Department of Justice http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/CivilRights/livoticonvictionpressrelease.pdf \nWABC http://7online.com/news/mayor-hold-press-conference-on-staten-island-mans-death/199186/ \nWCBS http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/18/de-blasio-offers-condolences-for-family-of-si-man-who-died-during-arrest/\n\nImage via: WABC\nhttp://7online.com/news/mayor-hold-press-conference-on-staten-island-mans-death/199186/", "title": "Suspect Dies After Apparent NYPD Chokehold", "publishedDate": "2014-07-19T14:09:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hWyIu1sHqk", "description": "\u041c\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0441\u044c - http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePedoRock\nhttp://dizard.ru/ - \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0439 \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 !\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 Twitch'\u0435 - http://www.twitch.tv/azazin_kreet\n\u042f \u0412\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435 - https://vk.com/id241749468\n\u041c\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a \u0412\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435 - http://vk.com/azazin_kreet\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e - https://vk.com/id241749468?", "title": "\u0412\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043e Valve", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T13:05:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hX-oyDYng0", "description": "A cover of Ring of Fire performed by David Ruddle at the Berwyn Festival 2008, North Wales.", "title": "David Ruddle Ring Of Fire Cover Berwyn Festival 2008", "publishedDate": "2008-06-22T17:47:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hX8PaRSwR0", "description": "Reino: Animalia\n \nFilo: Chordata\n \nClasse: Reptilia\n \nOrdem: Testudinata\n \nFam\u00edlia: Cheloniidae", "title": "TARTARUGA MARINHA", "publishedDate": "2010-12-13T21:49:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hXyFVmmY8A", "description": "Some of the Juniors and Seniors just having a little fun having a sandspur fight lol.", "title": "Sandspur Fight!", "publishedDate": "2011-11-12T06:23:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hYHkYlm-Vk", "description": "Me and Infamous 1v1'd with snipers on missile.

Ver mi video de Los Locos de la Vela en dailymotion http://dai.ly/A8RgOj Visita al Parque Nacional M\u00e9danos de Coro \nPatrimonio Natural Falconiano el pasado 29 de diciembre del 2011 donde tuve la oportunidad de capturar un magico atardecer, el video en su segunda parte presenta las fotograf\u00edas que tuve oportunidad de tomar en la carretera entre Coro y Punto Fijo  y en la entrada ubicada al lado del Monumento a la Madre ubicada en la ciudad de Santa Ana de Coro. El Parque Nacional est\u00e1 ubicado en el estado Falc\u00f3n, en la jurisdicci\u00f3n de los municipios Miranda, Colina y Falc\u00f3n, en el noroeste de Venezuela. Su \u00e1rea m\u00e1s importante est\u00e1 circunscrita alrededor del istmo, en la v\u00eda a la Pen\u00ednsula de Paraguan\u00e1 al costado norte de la ciudad de Santa Ana de Coro. El istmo comprende una faja de 30 km de largo por 5 km de ancho. Posee una altura media de 20 msnm. Sus acumulaciones arenosas se desplazan cambiantes debido a la acci\u00f3n de los vientos alisios que soplan de este a oeste. Los M\u00e9danos de Coro fueron declarados parque nacional el 6 de febrero de 1974 bajo decreto N\u00ba 1.592, abarca una superficie de 91.280 hect\u00e1reas, de las cuales 42.160 son tierras continentales y 49.120 son superficie marina.\nLas arenas suaves y secas de este Parque Nacional son consecuencia de la erosi\u00f3n e\u00f3lica sobre las rocas que con el tiempo son partidas en pedazos muy peque\u00f1os convirti\u00e9ndolas en arenilla y \u00e9sta, al desplazarse por la continua acci\u00f3n del viento, se va acumulando en parvas, convirti\u00e9ndose poco a poco a dunas que continuamente cambian de forma ya que est\u00e1n en continuo movimiento. Por ello tambi\u00e9n los m\u00e9danos han recibido el nombre de arenas n\u00f3madas.\nTambi\u00e9n existen formaciones similares en otras partes del pa\u00eds: en la v\u00eda a Castilletes, en la isla de Zapara (estado Zulia), en el cabo San Rom\u00e1n, en los alrededores de Puerto Cumarebo (estado Falc\u00f3n), y en los llanos venezolanos, en los alrededores del Parque Nacional Cinaruco Capanaparo (estado Apure) y el Parque Nacional Aguaro Guariquito (estado Gu\u00e1rico).\nEn los m\u00e9danos de Toc\u00f3pero y Puerto Cumarebo, fuera de los l\u00edmites del parque pueden observarse 'm\u00e9danos f\u00f3siles', colinas de sustrato arenoso formadas por la compactaci\u00f3n de los m\u00e9danos y cubiertas por vegetaci\u00f3n permanente. \u00c9stas son de diferentes tama\u00f1os y muestran diferentes niveles de desarrollo de la vegetaci\u00f3n, por lo que probablemente representen diferentes etapas de formaci\u00f3n, previas a los actuales M\u00e9danos de Coro.\nEl Parque est\u00e1 constituido en su mayor extensi\u00f3n, por el istmo que une el resto del Estado con la Pen\u00ednsula de Paraguan\u00e1, en el cual aparecen elementos dominantes del paisaje: Los M\u00e9danos (formaci\u00f3n de dunas), las comunidades arbustivas de manglares, las tierras con vegetaci\u00f3n herb\u00e1cea y espinares. El paisaje de este desierto venezolano est\u00e1 compuesto por dunas de 20 metros de alto sobre el nivel del mar aproximadamente, m\u00e9danos y marismas salitrosas.         Como en toda zona \u00e1rida o desierta, la vegetaci\u00f3n es escasa, existiendo no m\u00e1s de 60 especies vegetales, principalmente las tunas, cardones y cactus. Existen arbustivas de manglares en mamalolas costas fangosas. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n presentes en el parque, leguminosas como el cuj\u00ed yaque y peque\u00f1os \u00e1rboles como el dividive, el yabo y el olivo.\nDe la misma forma, la fauna silvestre es un tanto escasa, pudi\u00e9ndose observar reptiles, lagartos, iguanas, murci\u00e9lagos y el oso hormiguero, entre otros. Hay poca abundancia de mam\u00edferos: zorro com\u00fan (Cerdocyon thous), oso melero (Tamandua tetradactyla), conejo sabanero (Sylvilagus floridanus). Entre las aves destaca el cardenal coriano (Cardinalis phoenicea), el halc\u00f3n primito, gavilanes, perdices, la dara, palomas, turpiales, pel\u00edcanos (Pelecanus occidentalis), garzas y playeros.\nEl clima del parque es uno de los m\u00e1s \u00e1ridos de Venezuela, y la temperatura promedio es uniforme a lo largo del a\u00f1o, oscilando entre los 27 \u00b0C y los 30 \u00b0C, con temperaturas extremas de 47 \u00b0C en sombra y m\u00ednimos por debajo de los 16 \u00b0C.6 Las precipitaciones son escasas, de 250 a 500 m.m.\nResalta la presencia de antiguas calzadas de la \u00e9poca precolombina que se encuentran entre las dunas, las calzadas hacia los puertos pesqueros cercanos a la poblaci\u00f3n de Tacuato, la capilla de \"\u00c1nimas de Guasare\" donde se puede detener el transe\u00fante a rezar por estas \u00e1nimas o almas de personas que murieron hacia los a\u00f1os 1600 cuando se trasladaban a pie en busca de agua y el Paseo \"Monse\u00f1or Francisco Jos\u00e9 Iturriza\" mejor conocido como el \"Monumento a La Madre\".\nLas v\u00edas de acceso a Los M\u00e9danos son varias, sin embargo las m\u00e1s comunes son: la entrada desde el Paseo \"Monse\u00f1or Iturriza\", o por la autopista Coro-Punto Fijo.", "title": "Visita al Parque Nacional Medanos de Coro en una Puesta de Sol, Falcon, Venezuela", "publishedDate": "2012-01-04T23:09:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hfCuQryBaM", "description": "OH, MAMA!

(This is, of course, only if you have it installed before.)\n2) Download the Remote Play files. Link above.\n3) Open up File Manager of your choice, Copy/Move the .apk you just downloaded into the '/System/App/ ' Directory on your phone. \n4) Change the Permission of that .apk to RW-R-R\n\n5) Take the .dex and Move/Copy it to the '/Data/Dalvik-Cache ' Directory. Same as above you need to change permissions to RW-R-R.\n\n6) Take the two xml files. Now, move/copy these two files to the '/System/etc/permissions/ ' Directory. Once again, change the permissions to... RW-R-R.\n\n7) Okay, now for the important files. Take the two .jar files; once again, more copy/moving. Copy these two files to the '/System/Framework/ ' Directory. After they have been successfully copied them, change the permissions to RW-R-R.\n\n8) Now, Reboot your phone!\n\n9) Go to the play store and download the PlayStation App. \n\n10) Go back to the location where you putted the Remote Play .apk ('/System/App/ ') and click the .apk to install like normal. Now, the installation should finish. Great. \n\n11) Go back into PS App, and under the 'Connect to PS4' you should now see a Remote Play button to the right.\n\n12) Clicking it should open the Remote Play app, if you get the Error 8800.... whatever, Then you need to uninstall SuperSU or whatever the app is that controls your Root Permissions. I used the option, \"Reinstall - Cleanup for reinstallation from Google Play\" and then just never reinstalled, until I need root again.\n\nHave Fun :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWebsite:\nhttp://profreakzzhd.wordpress.com/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ProFreakZzHD\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ProFreakZzHD\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProFreakZzHD\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/ProFreakZzHD\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSong: Kv9 - Spirit Of The Forces\n------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "How to Remote Play PS4 on all Android phones", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T11:29:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8hkptqZSZxM", "description": "They often fight when it scrambles for favorite food and favorite place.
