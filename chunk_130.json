The film goes behind the scenes to reveal the creative choices and challenges made by Grammy\u00ae winner Billie Joe and Tony\u00ae winning director Michael Mayer (Spring Awakening) to create the thrilling and one-of-a-kind musical experience.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\". Kecuali Wajah dan telapak tangan.", "title": "181 Video Memakai Jilbab Pashmina Ala April Jasminei Terbaru Model 2014 27 03 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T21:24:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7B_m9FMY__o", "description": "http://www.narayana-verlag.de/Scholten-Intensiv-4-DVD-s/Jan-Scholten/b7867\n\nJan Scholten und seine Entdeckungen im Bereich des Periodensystems und der Pflanzenwelt sind aus der heutigen Hom\u00f6opathie nicht mehr wegzudenken und bilden die Basis f\u00fcr eine moderne Denk- und Arbeitsweise. Aufbauend auf den Grundlagen seines Seminars 2008 in Kandern, vertiefte Jan Scholten in seinem Berliner Seminar dieses Wissen und begeisterte das Publikum mit seinen aktuellen Erfahrungen zu den mineralischen und pflanzlichen Mitteln. Er pr\u00e4sentierte die Pflanzensystematik in erweiterter und differenzierter Form mit neuen Pflanzenfamilien, wodurch man langsam ein gro\u00dfes Bild erahnen kann.\n\nErster Tag -- Die Serien und Stadien im Periodensystem\nDas Ziel ist es, herauszufinden wo der Patient steht und welches Lebens\u00adthema zu l\u00f6sen ist (Serie). In welcher Entwicklungsstufe dieses Themas steckt der Mensch fest und wie reagiert er auf das Problem (Stadium)? Die Kombination der beiden ergibt wie in einem Koordinatensystem das richtige Mittel. Jan Scholten demonstriert seine Methodik anhand von Patientenf\u00e4llen aus der Lanthanidserie, mit Mitteln wie Praseodymium fluoricum oder Gadolinium carbonicum.\n\nZweiter Tag - Pflanzensystematik\nAuf der Grundlage des APG- Schemas ordnet Scholten die Pflanzen\u00adfamilien in seinem \u201ebotanischem Baum\" an. Aus geheilten F\u00e4llen und Pr\u00fcfungen k\u00f6nnen auch die pflanzlichen Mittel den entsprechenden Stadien zugeteilt werden. Diese noch recht neue Vorgehensweise zeigt er anschaulich anhand der Familie der Araliaceae (z.B. Efeu). Des weiteren kommen F\u00e4lle aus den Familien der Asteraceae (z.B.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Natural Cure for Eczema - Best Alternative to Cure Eczema", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T10:26:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Bba3Ra3t8A", "description": "Never penetrated so high up along the bank of this stream.

Across from me sat the person I had least expected. Wow. This week couldn't get any crazier. At least I hoped not. I sat unsure of how to feel at that moment, was it coincidence, or was she stalking me? I continued to stare at the girl with the brown spiraled curls, green-brown eyes and pretty smile, the girl who had introduced herself as Gabrielle at the airport the day before. The girl that had frightened me with her confidence. She noticed me staring at her and raised her eyebrows before smiling wide and bright. (Are you stalking me?) I asked loud enough for her to hear and watched as she let out a laugh that sounded like chimes. (Hardly.) She replied still smiling. (I happen to come here every Sunday morning.) She continued. (Really helps to clear minds after a hectic week, ya know?) She asked giving me a strange expression before standing up, nodding goodbye and moving on down the path. I was more than a little confused, she hadn't seemed the least bit surprised to see me there, and I was still scratching my head at the coincidence of running into her. I decided that I was just paranoid and it was just that, a coincidence. I stood up, kicked the snow from the bottom of my boots, then set off in the same direction Gabi had gone. I wasn't stalking her, I was just, curious I guess. I had a feeling by the way she walked that she knew I was behind her but didn't give it any thought. She continued on as though I didn't exist, which confused me further. I decided to turn around then, rather than face further humiliation. \n\n*Joe's POV*\n\nDevon had refused to take a tour of the city while Hannah accompanied me. I shrugged my shoulders in defiance, though I knew she couldn't see it due the fact we were speaking on the phone. I was surprised though that she had actually answered my call, that was a start I guessed.  I couldn't understand why she was acting so irritated, I had already apologized for ignoring her the day before, it was supposed to be forgive and forget right? It's as if she got a kick out of fighting with me. (Look, you need to get over it. It isn't a big deal, she's your cousin for god's sake, your own blood.) I said attempting again to convince her. (I said no.) She said stubbornly, completely unwilling. (Well, then call me back when you find it in yourself to quit acting like a spoiled little baby.) I replied hanging up and tossing my phone onto my dresser. Sometimes, Devon could just be, Irritating! She drove me insane one day, then the next we were the best friends. Her games confused and bothered me to no extent, but I had been playing them since we'd meet all those years ago, some things are forever. I knew behind the intractability and stubbornness, she was an incredible person. ( She said no.) Hannah asked from my doorway. She said this as a statement not a question, as if she had known it the entire time. (Yep.) I replied draining my head of the anger that had presented itself earlier. (Well, I guess another day then.) She replied before flashing me a smile and continuing down the hall. (Wait, I still want to go. I'm not about to have Devon ruin the day.) I called after her before standing up. She walked back and stood in my doorway once again. (Alright then, I'll just get dressed then.) She replied before turning on her heal and heading back. I closed my door and changed into some jeans, a tee shirt and my coat before slipping on some boots and a scarf. I walked downstairs, kind of surprised not to find Nick, I figured he had gone down to central park. I knew Kevin and Danielle had already left their townhouse, which was a few down from ours, probably hours before, for church.  Nick on the other hand usually had plans with his now ex-girlfriend Kylie. I knew he was doing well, but I also knew he wouldn't want to talk about it for a while, so I had let him be since the split.\n\nI ate some cereal then hurried to clean up around our home before Hannah appeared down the stairs. \n\nPlease Comment and sub if you haven't!

For more detail and indications about keeping the measure manually, please consult http://doremitutor.com/theory/time/measure-keeping.php\n\nAbout the whole note and the whole rest:\nThe rhythm value of the whole note or rest is equivalent to four times the value of a quarter, hence their duration extends four metronome ticks. \n\nAbout the half note and the half rest:\nThe rhythm value of the half note or rest is equivalent to twice the value of a quarter, hence their duration extends two metronome ticks. \n\nBasic theory:\nhttp://doremitutor.com/theory\nSpanish Version/Versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol: http://youtube.com/doremitutorparatodos", "title": "How to read music | Whole, half, and quarter notes (5)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T23:38:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7BtEN_9tA3Y", "description": "Created on June 21, 2010 using FlipShare.", "title": "Barnaby's Back!

It\u2019s important to go back to important scientific principles, making sure you apply products that act deeper in the skin - so typically, anti-ageing products, which are targeting the dermis, and water-based products are applied first and heavier creams are applied last.\n\nYour Night-time Regime\n\nYou need to cleanse first, for obvious reason. The most important thing to realise is that when you\u2019re taking off your makeup, the daily grime and excess oil, what you\u2019re actually doing is clearing away for absorption of the next step, which is really important.\n\nIf you\u2019re targeting particular problems in the skin, it\u2019s likely that your next step is going to be a water-based serum, which is usually a pricey investment containing key ingredients like vitamin C, retinol and peptides. So, you want to apply this next to allow maximum absorption.\n\nThe next step is a moisturiser that you want to apply while your skin is still damp from cleansing. This way, you\u2019ll maximise the amount of water that you lock in. It\u2019s important to apply this after the serum otherwise your pricey investment will be in vain because it won\u2019t get through.\n\nYour Daytime Regime\n\nYour daytime routine will be a little bit more complicated because there are more layers involved and we tend to wear makeup during the day. The same principles apply \u2013 cleanse to create the base for applying a serum. An antioxidant serum is a great addition for daytime to neutralise any free radicals that escape your sunscreen.\n\nThen you moisturise where you need it and apply a sunscreen. Dr Bunting is evangelical about using a sunscreen all year round because it is such a key anti-ageing ingredient. The key is to find one that you\u2019re comfortable with using every single day. This means finding one that has an elegant formulation, and when you do this, you\u2019ll find that it can behave like a primer, creating a lovely base for makeup.\n\nThe key to layering is to give products time to dry so that you build a nice base for makeup and you\u2019re not rushing. A worthwhile investment of your time to get the maximum out of your skincare.", "title": "How to layer your skincare products with Dr Sam Bunting", "publishedDate": "2013-09-02T08:44:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7BxwKNgv6lo", "description": "Ten filmik jest po\u015bwi\u0119cony dzieciom Pani Anny Przybylskiej.

A member of the Cracticidae, it is closely related to the butcherbirds. At one stage, the Australian Magpie was considered to be three separate species, although zones of hybridisation between forms reinforced the idea of a single species with several subspecies, nine of which are now recognised. The adult Australian Magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37 to 43 cm (14.5--17 in) in length, with distinctive black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. With its long legs, the Australian Magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground. This adaptation has led to many authorities maintaining it in its own genus Gymnorhina, however a genetic study published in 2013 has shown it to be most closely related to the Black Butcherbird (C. quoyi) rather than an early offshoot from the other butcherbirds.\nDescribed as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian Magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand in the 1860s but have subsequently been accused of displacing native birds and are now treated as a pest species.[2] Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Fiji, where the birds are not considered an invasive species. Spring in Australia is magpie season, when a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) around the country become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests, especially bike riders.\n\nIf you find an injured or sick native animal please contact your local wildlife rescue group.

It was manufactured between 1942 and 1947, from the six and junior eight, to the Super-8, where it cost more than and outperformed corresponding Cadillacs.[citation needed] The Clipper name alone was reintroduced in 1953 for the Company's bottom line through 1956, in which final year it was considered a standalone make, and not a model of Packard.\n\n For 1955, Packard became a marque in the newly formed Studebaker-Packard Corporation. The 1955 Clipper Custom offered torsion-bar suspension something not offered on other models, which only offered coil and leaf spring suspension. It also had a power steering option. Drivers enjoyed the comfortable ride but complained of door rattles and poor workmanship.\n\nMaybe more interesting is the animation work of John and Faith Hubley.  John created Mr. Magoo and with his wife created numerous independent films.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packard_Clipper\n\nS127", "title": "1956 Packard Clipper Torsion Suspension", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T15:33:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C1sw6kU2Hc", "description": "Source:\nhttp://www.20minutes.fr/article/346827/Politique-Quand-l-UMP-cafouille-pour-justifier-les-propos-de-Brice-Hortefeux.php\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/09/10/2009-09-10_caster_semenya_.html\nhttp://www.arretsurimages.net/vite.php?id=5387", "title": "Cafouillage pour justifier les propos de Hortefeux Rewind 11 septembre", "publishedDate": "2012-12-16T21:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C1vGHvhLI8", "description": "", "title": "reticulation seingue", "publishedDate": "2012-10-09T13:29:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C1zfSaqFdU", "description": "", "title": "SINGLE PHASE FULL WAVE THYRISTOR CONVERTORS", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T03:59:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C2-QWnsrk8", "description": "Firing the Italian Bodeo Revolver Model 1889 Enlisted", "title": "Firing of the Italian Bodeo Model 1889 Enlisted Model", "publishedDate": "2011-09-24T01:35:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C24HDPLVYU", "description": "Technology for Biobased Products\n\nLearn the basics of process design for biobased products.

It is made much more useful by alloying it with other materials.\n\n Cathodic protection is a well-accepted and proven technology that has been used on all types of steel structures for the past century. In fact the US Federal Highway Administration has officially stated; \"The only rehabilitation technique that has been proven to stop corrosion in salt-contaminated bridge decks, regardless of the chloride content of the concrete, is cathodic protection.\"\n\n A blast furnace is a huge steel container many metres high and lined with heat-resistant material. In the furnace the solid raw materials, i.e. iron ore, carbon (in the form of 'coke', a type of coal) and a flux (e.g. limestone) are fed into the top of the furnace and a blast of heated air is forced into the furnace from the bottom. Temperatures in a blast furnace can reach  \u2103. A simple diagram of a blast furnace is shown in Figure 1. The equations for the reactions that take place are shown in the flow diagram below.\n\n Tags are descriptors added by lens makers to help label content, attaching a vocabulary that is meaningful in the context of the lens.\n\n If you don't have permission to edit the content, you can still use \"Reuse\u00a0/\u00a0Edit\" to adapt the content by creating a derived copy of it and then editing and publishing the copy.\n\n We all know that steel will corrode naturally. Why? This goes back to the fundamental law of nature that all matter has a tendency to exist in the lowest energy state. When iron ore is mined out of the ground, the ore is in its lowest energy state, as it has existed for thousands of years in the ground. We process the ore and turn it into iron and steel so we can make useful structures such as steel bridges, buildings, reinforced concrete, etc.\n\n Nickel is often found in association with iron and sometimes forms thepound Ni3Fe, called awaruite in its mineral form. Nickel-iron meteorites are fairlymon.\n\n Iron joins magnesium in the carbonate pyroaurite. Iron pyrite, Fe2S, contains the iron, but it is difficult to isolate from the sulfur. This ore is used as a source for sulfur. A variation on pyrite is called pyrrhotite and theposition is written Fe1-xS. Iron also forms the sulfide marcasite, FeS2. Copper joins iron to form chalcopyrite, CuFeS2. Iron also joins with arsenic to form arsenopyrite, FeAsS. Iron with arsenic forms the mineral loellingite, FeAs2. Iron forms some phosphates like vivianite. Titanium and iron together form the oxide ilmenite, FeTiO3. Chromium and iron together form the oxide chromite, FeCr2O4. Iron forms an oxide mineral with titanium, lead and manganese called senaite. Iron joins in a sulfide with copper and antimony called tetrahedrite. A sulfide with antimony forms the mineral berthierite. Sulfides with copper include bornite, Cu5FeS4, and cubanite, CuFe2S3. A sulfide formed with tin, lead and antimony is called cylindrite. Iron is found in the mineral nagyagite, a sulfide, along with gold, lead, antimony, and tellurium. Tennantite is a sulfide which contains iron, arsenic, copper and antimony. Germanite is a sulfide which contains copper, germanium and iron. Lead, copper and iron join in the sulfide betekhtinite. Cobalt joins with iron and arsenic in the sulfide glaucodot, (Co,Fe)AsS.

Indeed, this herb has been long valued as a demulcent to soothe and coat inflamed tissues of the mouth, throat, and digestive and urinary tracts. \n\nIn addition to its important uses as a demulcent, the herb acts as an expectorant, which has also been long valued. Glycyrrhizin, which is the main active ingredient in licorice root acts as an expectorant by loosing and thinning mucus and phlegm from the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. Glycyrrhizin also harbors anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n\nToday, alternative health care professionals continue to use the benefits of licorice root to relieve respiratory ailments such as bronchitis, colds, coughs, congestion, sore throat, and allergies. In addition, it is used for stomach problems (including heartburn from reflux), inflammatory disorders, skin conditions (including eczema and psoriasis), minor skin infections, and liver problems. \n\n\nBut wait, there's more info about the health benefits of licorice root .. \n\n\nRecent animal studies have shown that licorice root enhances immunity by boosting levels of interferon. Interferon is one of nature's most powerful antiviral agents -- it helps to keep viruses from reproducing as well as it simulates the activity of other beneficial immune cells. Not surprising, other studies have shown that licorice fights the herpes simplex virus, which is the troublemaker that causes genital herpes and cold sores. \n\n\n\nEuropean physicians treasure the health benefits of licorice root, meaning they highly regard it as one of the top herbal medicines for combating viral hepatitis. They use the intravenous form for the treatment of Hepatitis B and C. However, people who want to take advantage of licorice's possible healing action for hepatitis should discuss the herb with a knowledgeable health care provider. \n\n\n\nRecent studies indicate that licorice root also contains substances that kill certain bacteria and the fungus responsible for vaginal yeast infections. \n\n\nOne of the most popular uses for this healing herb is for ulcers of the digestive tract. The benefits of licorice root are quite multifaceted in this area! According to the well-renowned tome \"The Natural Physicians Healing Therapies\" by Mark Stengler, N.D. the author states:\n\n\"It stimulates cell growth of the stomach and intestinal linings, increases the natural mucous lining of the stomach, increases blood flow to the damaged tissues, and decreases muscle spasms.\" The recommended form of use is DGL (glycyrrhetinic acid). (Page 311.) \n\n\n\nLicorice root also seems to support the adrenal glands -- making these adrenal hormones such as cortisol (the body's primary stress-fighting adrenal hormone) more available to the body. As such, licorice may help lessen symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia by enhancing cortisol activity. \n\n\n\nLicorice root contains phytoestrogens that appear to have mild estrogen-like effects. As such, it is commonly included in formulas to help combat PMS and menopausal complaints. \n\n\nLicorice root also contains various flavonoids, which are potent antioxidants. \n\n\nSome experts point out that one -- among the arsenal of benefits of licorice root is that it's an excellent liver tonic. \n\n\nLastly, licorice is considered a \"harmonizing\" herb, which means when used in a formula licorice can enhance other herbs to work more effectively to reduce their toxicity. In addition, it has the ability to tame the bitter taste of many other medicinal herbs. \n\nOther Licorice Health Benefits \n\nLicorice may also help to: \n\n\n\n\u2022Protect against cancer due to its antioxidant properties \n\n\u2022Control canker sores by accelerating its healing \n\nWWW.FRANKTORTORICI.COM", "title": "The REAL RED BULL...Licorice Root Extract [ Eclectic Institute]- www.franktortorici.com", "publishedDate": "2011-05-18T16:22:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C6OxpuL1VA", "description": "This video shows the period of Italian Unification.", "title": "Risorgimento Italiano (Italian Unification)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-03T15:12:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C6YvSUmHME", "description": "Ultimate COck Block  Male Cow Tries To Get It In But Man Accidentally Hits Female Cow Crossin\n\nSubscribe for more from World Star Hip Hop !.", "title": "Ultimate COck Block  Male Cow Tries To Get It In But Man Accidentally Hits Female Cow Crossin", "publishedDate": "2013-07-03T01:14:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C7C6lK1gLs", "description": "", "title": "OHKitchen EP5: Pak Nam - Laotian Salad", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T04:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C7SaIaAzms", "description": "Benzene Chemical Structure description.", "title": "Benzene Molecule", "publishedDate": "2010-04-02T21:02:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7C7kkrK48Ws", "description": "As a geek and a former divinity student i can't believe how low the green goblin has sunk in his quest to spoil everything!", "title": "The Green Goblin spoils The Pentateuch!

It has been recorded as a vagrant from the Australian territory of Christmas Island. This crake nests in a dry location on the ground in marsh vegetation, laying 6-9 eggs. It is mainly a permanent resident throughout its range, but some northern populations migrate further south in winter.\nThe Ruddy-breasted Crake is about 22--23 cm long. The body is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the reeds or undergrowth. It has long toes and a short tail. Coloring includes a pale brown back and chestnut head and underparts, with white barring on the flanks and undertail. The bill is yellowish, and the eyes, legs, and feet are red.\nThe sexes are similar, but juveniles are dark brown with some white spotting.\nThese birds probe in mud or shallow water and also pick up food by sight.

We demonstrate using synchrotron-based x-ray tomographic microscopy that the fossils have features incompatible with multicellular metazoan embryos. The developmental pattern is comparable with nonmetazoan holozoans, including germination stages that preclude postcleavage embryology characteristic of metazoans. We conclude that these fossils are neither animals nor embryos. They belong outside crown-group Metazoa, within total-group Holozoa (the sister clade to Fungi that includes Metazoa, Choanoflagellata, and Mesomycetozoea) or perhaps on even more distant branches in the eukaryote tree. They represent an evolutionary grade in which palintomic cleavage served the function of producing propagules for dispersion. \n\nSupporting Online Material Video\n\nMovie S1\nMicrotomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4405.\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/22/334.6063.1696.DC1/1209537s1.mov\n\nMovie S2\nMicrotomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4405, plane perpendicular to that of Movie S1.\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/22/334.6063.1696.DC1/1209537s2.mov\n\nMovie S3\nMicrotomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4403.\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/22/334.6063.1696.DC1/1209537s3.mov\n\nMovie S4\nMicrotomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4404.\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/22/334.6063.1696.DC1/1209537s4.mov\n\nMovie S5\nMicrotomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4407.\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/12/22/334.6063.1696.DC1/1209537s5.mov", "title": "Microtomographic orthoslice series through specimen SMNH X 4405 (s1 - s5)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-27T00:09:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7CDyjMouQyc", "description": "The history behind the technology of the Motion Picture", "title": "History of the Motion Picture", "publishedDate": "2007-12-09T01:29:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7CESSnFgUjY", "description": "", "title": "polinizador de  Epipactis  kleinii", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T12:39:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7CFHZqm-qmY", "description": "3 year old Jaxon explains to Mommy the difference between Mom & Dads voices.", "title": "Dads the Disciplinarian", "publishedDate": "2012-03-20T00:09:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7CGXAX2yH7A", "description": "Die ruhige, stimmungsvolle Novemberlandschaft Mecklenburgs.

We then walked into star bucks and got in line there were only 3 people in star bucks NOT including the workers. We ordered our drinks. \"I'll go find some where to sit!!\" I said. \"okay\" Taylor said. I then sat in a booth and got out my macbook (laptop) and just started to browse through the internet. \"here is your frappicinno\" I heard taylor say. She then set down my drink next to my computer. \"Thanks!!\" I said. \"look at this picture of Justin bieber isn't it so cute!!\" I said. \"Omg he looks so hot in that picture!!\" Taylor said. \"I forgot to get a cake pop!!

People who have this condition struggle with the sensation in a very real sense.\n\n\"One of the things that can cause it commonly is a fall, a head injury. It can also occur due to an infection in the inner ear. It also occurs from degenerative changes as we age,\" says Dawn Root, physical therapist with Lee Memorial Health System. \n\nSimple enough to grasp, but what's actually going on in your head is the disruption of a delicate balance.\n\n\"We have semi circular canals in the inner ear, there's three of them in the right ear and three of them in the left ear, there's also a central area here called the utricle. In the utricle there are a lot of calcium crystals that are contained within. Sometimes some of those calcium crystals can become dislodged from the utricle and then fall into the semi circular canals. Then once they're in those canals, when the patient moves their head in certain positions the crystals will move inside the canal and then create the symptoms of vertigo,\" says Root. \n\nThe definition of vertigo is the illusion of motion. People may feel like they're spinning when they're not. It can cause dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, and light-headedness. If the condition doesn't resolve on its own- there is a specialized therapy to alleviate positional vertigo.\n\n\"The goal of therapy is to move the patient in certain positions,\" says Root. \n\nIt generally takes between one and three sessions to help your body put things in proper order. \n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n \nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

You and a friend are out in a restaurant and all of a sudden, they start choking.  I'm going to have my friend Hannah come over here.  We're out, we're having a good time, we're eating and all of the sudden, she seems like she's choking. First, you ask, \"Are you OK\"?  Oftentimes, the international sign for choking is this. I can't breathe.  Something's going on.  If you're around other people, you want to get them to help you.  If you're in a restaurant or place of business, have someone call out for help and have the people help you out.  Tell them what you're doing.  Don't just attack them because that will just heighten their anxiety and their panic.  What you're going to do is, you're going to stand behind them and you're going to wrap your arms all away around.  You find their belly button with your pinky.  Make a fist.  \n\nPut the pinky on the bellybutton, then roll it up so the knuckle of your thumb is right there and then you thrust.  You pull it in and up, but I'm not going to do it as hard.  In and up.  In and up until they can dislodge whatever is in there and they can breathe again.  Don't go crazy like in the movies and start slapping their back and wrestling.  Sometimes people get carried away and they want to slap your back.  They just end up hurting you.  If the person is pregnant or a larger person and you can't get your arms all away around to where their belly button is, you want to go higher, up to where their breastbone is.  So, say Hannah is pregnant - Congratulations! \n\nYou wrap around.  You find their breastbone.  You do the same thing. In and up.  In and up until they dislodge whatever is in their throat and they can breathe again.  If the person is so big, if you're a small person, and you have a big strapping person with you who's choking and you just can't even do that.  You can assist them in doing a self Heimlich maneuver on a chair or surface that will get to their diaphragm.  You just lean them over.  Talk them through it.  \n\nStay calm. The more panicky you get, the more panicky they're going to get. They're already in a state of anxiety because they can't breathe, which is normal.  If they lose consciousness and they fall to the floor, you're going to lay them down.  You're going to roll them over and then you're going to do the same thing.  You're going to find the bellybutton, roll up, and you're going to thrust while they're on the floor until that comes out or until help arrives.  Continue trying to do the thrusts and trying to get them to get that out of their throat so they can breathe again.

Low and big feed opening make the production line easy to arrange and increase the size of feeding material.\n\n Dolomitization of calcite also occurs at certain depths of coral atolls where water is undersaturated in calcium carbonate but saturated in dolomite. Convection created by tides and sea currents enhance this change. Hydrothermal currents created by volcanoes under the atoll may also play an important role.\n\n Use limestone, dolomite or marble for hard water environments and high pH conditions where buffering is required.\n\n Marble and dolomite are related to limestone and are discussed as a metamorphic rocks. Metamorphic Rocks form from the alteration of igneous and sedimentary rocks through pressure and heat . Examples include hornfels, quartzite, marble, dolomite, slate, phyllite, schist and gneiss. All of these rocks are suitable for use in the aquarium, depending upon the biotype maintained. Marble is the mostmonly used metamorphic rock. This rock forms when limestones are intruded by magma or covered with lavas, where heat and pressure changes in the original limestone to a hard rock. Marbles are generally pale coloured rocks of medium to course grain size. The main mineral in marble is calcite.\u00a0 Marble can be used only in aquaria where a high pH is maintained or as a substrate in hard-water aquaria.

In addition, the sounds are put randomly in the stereo field. \n\nThis is done as follows:\n-sequencers to quantizer to CV in of VCO\n- triangle/saw ouput of VCO to multiple to two separate VCAs\n- each VCA controlled by one output of the noisering\n- outputs of the VCA to two channels of the mixing desk: one panned hard right, the other panned hard left\n- clock of noisering out to clock in of Doepfer A-149 random voltage to random voltage to CV-in shape of VCO.", "title": "Modular Sounds 4", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T21:32:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7CmAxqcFk68", "description": "On 26th of December 2012, we went to Singapore!

Lo m\u00e1s corriente es que se produzca tras una muerte del embri\u00f3n que no va acompa\u00f1ada del no desarrollo de trofoblasto. Para su diagn\u00f3stico, el tama\u00f1o ha de ser suficiente para poder valorarse con ecograf\u00eda. Una gestaci\u00f3n es anembrionada si la ecograf\u00eda puede descubrir un saco vac\u00edo de 13 mm o un di\u00e1metro de saco gestacional de 18 mm sin embri\u00f3n.\nEl huevo huero es una de las causas de aborto espont\u00e1neo.\nSe denomina gestaci\u00f3n anembrionada o huevo huero a aquella en la que no es posible reconocer estructuras embrionarias dentro de la bolsa corial.\n\nEl diagn\u00f3stico es ecogr\u00e1fico y se basa en la detecci\u00f3n de un saco gestacional vac\u00edo cuando, por su edad gestacional, deber\u00eda verse estructuras embrionarias.\n\nAnte la duda de que se trate de una gestaci\u00f3n evolutiva muy precoz, se recomienda repetir la ecograf\u00eda unos d\u00edas o una semana despu\u00e9s. Se produce por el detenimiento en el desarrollo de una parte de las c\u00e9lulas del disco embrionario que dar\u00e1n lugar al embri\u00f3n, produci\u00e9ndose la reabsorci\u00f3n completa de \u00e9ste.\n\nNo obstante, aunque esto ocurra, otras c\u00e9lulas, las que dar\u00e1n origen a la placenta y la bolsa amni\u00f3tica crecen durante un tiempo y son capaces de producir hormonas como la HCG, por lo que aun en ausencia de embri\u00f3n, el test de embarazo seguir\u00e1 siendo positivo. La gestaci\u00f3n suele finalizar en un aborto espontaneo o bien, la evacuaci\u00f3n uterina se realizar\u00e1 mediante un legrado uterino. \n\nAn anembryonic gestation (aka blighted ovum) is a pregnancy in which the very early pregnancy appears normal on an ultrasound scan, but as the pregnancy progresses a visible embryo never develops. In a normal pregnancy, an embryo would be visible on an ultrasound by six weeks after the woman's last menstrual period.\nAn anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal-appearing gestational sac, but the absence of an embryo. It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast. When small, the sac cannot be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy, as there may be a yolk sac, though a fetal pole is not seen. For diagnosis, the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established. A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) greater than 13 mm and no yolk sac, or an MGD more than 18 mm with no embryo.\nMany centers offer mothers a follow-up ultrasound 10 days later to verify diagnosis.\nAnembryonic gestation is one of the causes of miscarriage of a pregnancy. Several management options exist for anembryonic pregnancies which have not miscarried on their own.", "title": "Vaginal Sonogram: Anembryonic Gestation -Ecograf\u00eda Vaginal: Gestaci\u00f3n anembrionada o Huevo Huero", "publishedDate": "2009-08-20T02:40:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Cyz1yIUbPI", "description": "Tampa DUI Lawyer\nhttp://www.MuscaLaw.com\n813-362-5623\n1 800 Musca Law\n800 687-2252\n330 South Falkenburg Road\nTampa, Florida 33619\nPhone: 813-362-5623\n\n\n\n\nTampa, Florida 33619\n\n\n\n\nIf perhaps you were arrested for driving under the influence, a Tampa DUI lawyer is certainly one expert you absolutely need.

In fact, it's almost a relief. But as time passes, Kat begins to come to grips with how deeply Eve's disappearance has affected her. Returning home on a break from college, she finds herself confronted with the truth about her mother's departure, and her own denial about the events surrounding it...\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

The women are Chabad Lubavitch, a sect of Orthodox Hasidim, one of the more conservative branches of Judaism today.\n\nWith unprecedented access, Shekinah explores the perspectives of these young women from school age through courtship and marriage. Their relationships with men are based on the Kabbalah, the mystical aspect of Judaism. They see God as both masculine and feminine, and marriage as pre-ordained in heaven. The laws of Torah affect almost everything they do, and still their lives are filled with great passion. They explain why \"kosher\" sex, with all its complex divine commandments, is as intense and blissful as Eastern Tantric practices, and why they see themselves as more liberated than most women today. Their revelations break many long-standing stereotypes and unveil the secrets of this mysterious women's world.\n\nShekinah also explores the evolving relationships of these young women with the greater Jewish and French-Qu\u00e9becois communities -- from both perspectives. We see how tolerance develops and misconceptions dissolve, as both sides learn about each other and come to open their hearts and minds.\n\n--------------------\n\nShekinah, la vie intime des femmes hassidiques nous fait p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le monde inconnu de jeunes femmes hassidiques qui semblent avoir un mode de vie du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle dans le Qu\u00e9bec du XXIe si\u00e8cle.

Among other distinguishing features, forest elephants are smaller than savanna elephants; their ears are more oval-shaped, their tusks are straighter and point downward (the tusks of savanna elephants curve outwards).\n Limited to the Congo Basin countries, forest elephants are being poached at ever accelerating rates.\n John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General, recently stated that \"Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rates continue. The situation is particularly acute in Central Africa\u2014where the estimated poaching rate is twice the continental average.\" \n\nThis camera trap footage was a result of a joint 1 year project by the Panafrican Research and Monitoring Program at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, The US Fish and Wildlife Service, and The Lukuru Foundation, with additional funding provided by The Lucie Burgers Foundation for Comparative Behavior Research, Arnhem, The Netherlands, The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Amsterdam, and The African Wildlife Foundation.

Ahmed was jailed for 15 months, during which time he was given a further conviction for targeting gay people during a pride procession in Derby.\nAfter serving his sentence, Ahmed abandoned his wife Nashira Arif, 28, and their three children 16 months ago to join Islamic group Jund al-Sham in Syria before switching his allegiance to IS.\nIt was also well known before he left the country that Ahmed had links to Anjem Choudary and the banned British terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun.In one interview available online, the jihadi said he was \u2018craving martyrdom\u2019. \u2018This is more important that my family. I would sacrifice my children 100 times for the sake of Allah,' he said. Yesterday, Ahmed\u2019s family told the Mail that authorities in the UK could have stopped him murdering innocents by arresting him at the airport as he left for Syria 16 months ago. \nInsurance Loans  Mortgage  Attorney Credit  Lawyer  Donate  \n\nisis footage war  isis footage shows bosnian children in syria  isis footage kobani   isis footage kobane  isis footage airstrike  isis footage fighting  isis footage attack isis footage combat syria war syria airstrikes syria airstrike isis syria airstrike footage  syria bombing syria bombing footage us isis us attack isis  iraq war  iraq vs america war  news  today airstrikes on isis  airstrikes in syria airstrikes on isis footage cbn news\nDegree  Hosting Claim  Conference Call Trading  Software Recovery  Transfer  Gas/Electricity  Classes  Rehab Treatment .

Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. May his 62 years of living, well, so livingly console the many of us who will miss him dearly\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"", "title": "Hitchens '10: \"...sexist, but charming...\"", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T03:41:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DNiSVVCqH4", "description": "Aamir Khan birthday special: The actor's experiments with style By http://www.bollywoodlife.com\n\nHe had a tiny soul patch in Dil Chahta Hai, a bristly moustache in Talaash; he wore his hair long in Fanaa and very short in Ghajini.

Named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle. Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.[11][12] While only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.[13][14][15]\n\nSaturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron, nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds), surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer.[16] The planet exhibits a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's magnetic field but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of the Earth due to Saturn's larger body radius. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter's.[17] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), faster than on Jupiter, but not as fast as those on Neptune.[18]\n\nSaturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two[19] known moons orbit the planet; fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of \"moonlets\" comprising the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest and the Solar System's second largest moon, is larger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to retain a substantial atmosphere.[20]", "title": "Saturn With Stacked Image", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T14:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DP3d_jre4k", "description": "English Grammar - created using PowToon -  http://www.powtoon.com/", "title": "Conjunction in English Grammar", "publishedDate": "2013-02-10T07:05:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DP5ilmk6z8", "description": "Ashridge Nurseries shows you how to prune a 1 year old maiden fruit tree in order to develop a bush-shaped adult tree.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Shri, the Tansen Award, the Bharat Ratna and many more. His debut  was at the age of 14, after which there was no looking back.\nBorn in a house fully immersed in the tunes and rhythm of music, young Bismillah started even playing marbles to the tunes of shehnai. Though born in a family of traditional shehnai players, his relatives were astonished to witness the innate musical talent in young Bismillah.\nBismillah, with his penchant for perfection, often practiced in his room for 4-6 hours, at a stretch. Oblivious to the changes taking place outside the four walls he experimented and discovered new heights and depths of musical scales and melodies. Bismillah was so overtaken by the thirst to perfect his own music that he often missed the other pleasures in a young boy's life.\nUstad Bismillah Khan  toured the world extensively and  brought soulful tunes of the shehnai to the hearts of millions. Edinburgh Festival, in UK in (1966), Montreal World Exposition in 1967, Cannes Art Festival, France (1969), Osaka World Exposition in 1970, are but some of the international performances which Khan Sahib adorned. Wherever he went, he received thundering applause from his inspired and touched audiences.\nFirst musician to play for Independent India at Red Fort on 15th August, 1947, he played the opening tunes at the Red Fort, New Delhi on the 50th year of Indian Independence in 1997. The President Shri K.R Narayanan conferred the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna Award upon Ustad Bismillah Khan on May 4, 2001.", "title": "The Shehnai Maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T09:06:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7D__k5PFN8Q", "description": "Subscribe To Our Channel: http://ta.gd/lutv\n\nGet Our APP: iOS: http://ta.gd/linkup - Android: http://ta.gd/androi\nFACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/vDzP6 -- TWITTER: http://goo.gl/ZvbkK\n\nVisit our website for the latest news & videos: http://goo.gl/pt8cpU\nOur SoundCloud: http://goo.gl/ALheCh\nBrowse Our Online Shop: http://goo.gl/GCnl6f\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nFor enquiries visit our website or see email list below:\n\nAdvertising Enquiries - advertising@linkuptv.co.uk\nMixtape Promotion - mixtapes@linkuptv.co.uk\nVideo Production - production@linkuptv.co.uk\nUpload your video to our YouTube Channel - http://goo.gl/qKU60M\nAppear On Freestyle Show - freestyle@linkuptv.co.uk\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nIf you believe this video breaches your copyright, please direct your DMCA related emails to enea@linkuptv.co.uk", "title": "Rhino & Baby R - Tryna Get It (Music Video) @RhinoUkOfficial @BabyOTH", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T15:02:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7D_yDKg691A", "description": "Un des plus grand maelstrom du monde pr\u00e8s des iles lofoten norv\u00e8ge", "title": "maelstrom saltstraumen norvege norway", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T10:37:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DaQVxbB-2U", "description": "Dave Whitton, John Crook and Yes Dunblane flashmob sing Dougie MacLean's Caledonia in support of Scottish independence outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. \n\nVOTE YES!!", "title": "Caledonia by Yes Dunblane's flashmob in Glasgow", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T14:52:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Da_HolVErQ", "description": "Kellys best moments with Joan brings her to tears", "title": "Kelly Osbourne Crying Over Joan Rivers on Fashion Police", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T11:59:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Db3Gld38lo", "description": "Overview of this huge annual festival held in early May in Fukuoka City.

The new Forester picks up where the old one left off, but offers more interior space, sharper handling and smart looks.\n\nAs you can see the boot is a decent size, larger than a Nissan Qashqai with a flat load lip and with the seats folded as easily as pulling this lever standard on all but the cheapest you can transport larger items. \n\nThanks to a lowered floor there is also more room for passengers, headroom and legroom is plentiful and these big wide opening doors make it easy to get in and out. \n\nIn fact the whole cabin is larger because the front pillars have been moved forwards and for items that you don't put in the boot, there is a large cubby hole here. The new Forester definitely lives up to practical reputation built by previous models as there is more storage here and here. There is enough adjustment in the seat to find a comfortable driving position, and on that note...\n\nThe first place I wanted to drive was off road, the 4x4 system adapts to whatever conditions you are driving in (perfect for the rough British winter), and features hill hold and downhill aid functions as standard. Plus the suspension settings are well judged keeping things comfortable on rough ground.\n\nMinimising body roll in the corners on tarmac. Combine that with the good throttle response, lower centre of gravity and more rigid body and the Forester has an improved drive over the 3rd generation it replaces. If it's towing that you will be doing then this car can tow 2 tonnes and is fitted with a stabilisation system to keep things under control when your trailer or caravan is attached. \n\nNow though it is time to talk about its negative points. I will start with the steering. Although light it offers very little feedback. The the CVT automatic gearbox is not smooth and is a bit whiny. But the real whining will come from your purse because despite fuel consumption and performance coming on leaps and bounds in recent years, sadly the Forester's figures do not fare well against the competition. You will be lucky to get 28 miles to the gallon out of the 2.0 litre petrol, so you could go for the diesel which returns a more acceptable 49 miles to the gallon, but that's still some way behind the Mazda CX-5 and Ford Kuga.\n\nInside, there are some cheap looking buttons and switches, however let's not forget what type of vehicle this is, it's a rugged, fit for purpose, hard wearing Subaru with a loyal following by those that love its workmanlike charm. And for that reason, it's sure to win the heart of those wanting a dependable, reliable and practical SUV.", "title": "Subaru Forester SUV 2013 review - CarBuyer", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T10:42:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Dxo0Yjno3I", "description": "Watch 10 of our unreleased videos! http://eepurl.com/lqSmf\nPre-order our book here: http://bit.ly/stuffbook\nWant to sponsor our next video? http://bit.ly/1exkRia\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel here: http://bit.ly/19gTRke\n\nUse this video at your next meeting or event: http://bit.ly/P9hLLH\n\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/17RLEco Facebook: http://on.fb.me/HRYSKu\n......\n\nWords and phrases that Christians love to use instead of the already perfectly adequate words provided by the English language.", "title": "Shoot Christians Say", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T20:14:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Dxwa2TIGuQ", "description": "The Northrop Grumman-built MQ-8B Fire Scout conducts first test flights from the U.S. Navy's littoral combat ship, USS Freedom (LCS 1) in November 2010.", "title": "Fire Scout Littoral Combat Ship Testing", "publishedDate": "2011-05-16T19:24:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Dy2Khtv27w", "description": "", "title": "MUSLIM 7wal Nass", "publishedDate": "2009-08-30T13:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DyEV60cal8", "description": "", "title": "Alejandro Marque", "publishedDate": "2012-07-06T16:39:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DyG2Nt-MaY", "description": "In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which cellular ribosomes create proteins. It is part of the process of gene expression. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription is decoded by a ribosome complex to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide, that will later fold into an active protein. In bacteria, translation occurs in the cell's cytoplasm, where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located, and bind to the mRNA. In eukaryotes, translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis. The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNA. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is \"read\" by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker", "title": "Translation of mRNA", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T13:49:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7DyVzDBtqLc", "description": "\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud0c8 \uc774\ud2b9\uc774 \uc9c0\uc83c\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b", "title": "SM\ub304\uc2a4\ubc30\ud2c0", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12T07:09:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Dz-kyKNZRE", "description": "MONISM (The Netherlands), active since 2009.

It is a common medium used in modern fine art/art\nAcrylic resin, any of a group of related polymers formed from a mixture of monomers selected from the C1 to C8 acrylate esters, methyl methacrylate and, often, styrene[1].\nAcrylic glass, a generic term for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) hard clear plastic, commonly known by the brand names Plexiglas, Lucite, or Perspex.\nAcrylate polymers, a group of polymers (plastics), noted for transparency and elasticity\n\nPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a transparent thermoplastic, often used as a light or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. It is sometimes called acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in various laboratories, and was first brought to market in 1933 by Rohm and Haas Company, under the trademark Plexiglas.[4] It has since been sold under many different names including Lucite and Perspex.\nThe often-seen spelling poly(methyl 2-methylpropanoate) with -an- is an error for poly(methyl 2-methylpropenoate), based on propenoic acid.\nPMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not necessary. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost, but behaves in a brittle manner when loaded, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching compared to conventional inorganic glass.\n\nPolystyrene:\nIUPAC poly(1-phenylethene-1,2-diyl)) also known as Thermocole, abbreviated following ISO Standard PS, is an aromatic polymer made from the monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is manufactured from petroleum by the chemical industry. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale being several billion kilograms per year.\nPolystyrene is a thermoplastic substance, which is in solid (glassy) state at room temperature, but flows if heated above its glass transition temperature of about 100 \u00b0C (for molding or extrusion), and becomes solid again when cooled. Pure solid polystyrene is a colorless, hard plastic with limited flexibility. It can be cast into molds with fine detail. Polystyrene can be transparent or can be made to take on various colors.\nSolid polystyrene is used, for example, in disposable cutlery, plastic models, CD and DVD cases, and smoke detector housings. Products made from foamed polystyrene are nearly ubiquitous, for example packing materials, insulation, and foam drink cups.\nPolystyrene can be recycled, and has the number \"6\" as its recycling symbol. The increasing oil prices have increased the value of polystyrene for recycling. No known microorganism has yet been shown to biodegrade polystyrene, and it is often abundant as a form of pollution in the outdoor environment, particularly along shores and waterways especially in its low density cellular form.\n\nhttp://www.babikenshop.com/acrylic-glass-cufflinks-pmma-cufflinks-ps-cufflinks-c1201-p-786.html \n\nhttp://www.babikenshop.com/cufflinks-c-133.html", "title": "Acrylic Cufflinks, Acrylic Glass Cufflinks, PMMA Cufflinks, PS Cufflinks Babiken C1201", "publishedDate": "2012-01-04T14:32:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7E2_jNcRa-E", "description": "Goodline has started a series of creative advertisements to reach our audience, laced with humour and insight.

Sin embargo, cada vez hay m\u00e1s evidencias de que no s\u00f3lo son abundantes, sino que adem\u00e1s ejercen papeles que a menudo no han sido valorados en su justa medida. En definitiva, se ha subestimado la importancia de las arqueas en los ecosistemas del planeta.\nEn la actualidad, se considera que las arqueas figuran entre las m\u00e1s abundantes formas de vida en la Tierra, y que intervienen de manera decisiva en procesos vitales para los ecosistemas, incluyendo su intervenci\u00f3n en el ciclo del nitr\u00f3geno. Se sabe tambi\u00e9n que las arqueas son el principal mecanismo que mantiene al metano marino fuera de la atm\u00f3sfera.\n\nLas arqueas son consideras como uno de los tres dominios de la vida en la Tierra, junto con las bacterias y los eucariotas (que incluyen a vegetales y animales).\nHasta ahora, se desconoc\u00eda que alg\u00fan miembro del dominio de las arqueas fuese parte de una red alimentaria. Por eso, la comunidad cient\u00edfica ignoraba si esta clase de forma de vida podr\u00eda ser apta como alimento para alg\u00fan animal.\nEl equipo de Andrew Thurber, de la Universidad Estatal de Oreg\u00f3n, inicialmente estaba observando las formas de vida en un surtidor del fondo marino frente al litoral de Costa Rica, cuando abri\u00f3 una roca y encontr\u00f3 gusanos viviendo dentro de las grietas. Los investigadores constataron que los gusanos hab\u00edan estado aliment\u00e1ndose de arqueas, las cuales, a su vez, consum\u00edan metano. Esto se demostr\u00f3 gracias a que se pudo rastrear una forma isot\u00f3pica del metano desde las arqueas hasta los gusanos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, los investigadores efectuaron experimentos en el laboratorio. Alimentaron a los gusanos con dos tipos de arqueas, y tambi\u00e9n con bacterias, espinacas o arroz. Los gusanos prosperaron con todas las fuentes de alimentaci\u00f3n, creciendo al mismo ritmo. Esto indica que las arqueas son, al menos para esos gusanos, una fuente de alimento tan v\u00e1lida como otras m\u00e1s convencionales.\n\nEl hallazgo de que las arqueas son devoradas por animales, a\u00f1ade una vuelta de tuerca al ya complejo ciclo del metano, un potente gas de efecto invernadero, y tambi\u00e9n abre una nueva v\u00eda de investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn el estudio tambi\u00e9n han trabajado Lisa Levin del Instituto Scripps de Oceanograf\u00eda de la Universidad de California en San Diego, y Victoria Orphan y Jeffrey Marlow, del Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de California.", "title": "Verifican que hay animales que se alimentan de arqueas", "publishedDate": "2012-04-19T12:16:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7E8X1xGohUM", "description": "Subscribe and visit http://www.thedrainclaw.com.\nAn all natural drain cleaner, safe for septic systems is the Roebic Drain and Trap Cleaner.

An MS configuration that detects signals on metal plates from electrical currents produced by ion oscillations. The hallmark of FT-MS is its high resolution; 1-2 ppm mass accuracy or lower can be achieved. A drawback is the long cycle time required for acquisition of MS and particularly MS/MS spectra. Fourier transform analysis consists of determining the ion cyclotron resonances (which refers to the number of orbits completed/sec), not by scanning slowly through the spectrum as a function of frequency, but by recording the oscillating charge induced in a detector plate by orbiting ions as they approach and recede from that plate. FT of that time-domain data then yields ALL of the cyclotron frequencies at once, for a time saving by a factor of ~10,000. The FTICR-MS consists of an ion source, some ion optics to transfer the ions into the magnetic field, and the Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) cell or Penning trap. After ion's are trapped in the ICR cell, they are excited by a resonant excitation pulse into a coherent orbit. The excitation amplifier is then turned off and the ions continue to orbit at their final radius. Ions moving near electrodes cause an image charge to form on these electrodes to balance the ions' electric field. In the case of a circular orbit, this image charge will oscillate at the ion's resonant frequency, and can be detected by a sensitive preamplifier circuit, digitized, and stored in computer memory. http://www.cprmap.com/proteomic_technologies/mass_spectrometry/1271.html", "title": "Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry", "publishedDate": "2008-02-19T07:17:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7EIM16AvkGk", "description": "http://www.vacuum-direct.com/dyson-dc39-animal-vacuum.aspx\n\nThe newest Dyson canister is one of a kind, featuring the famous root cyclone technology and ball technology in an uber maneuverable canister vacuum.

They include the two classic genres of the sea geese ( Branta ) and field geese ( Anser ).\n\nThe total of fifteen species varying in color from black and gray or brown. Males and females are very similar in color. They have a relatively long neck and long legs can through the medium, the centrally located beneath the body, running relatively quickly.\nAll fifteen species live in the northern hemisphere.\n\nAll real geese show a ritualized mating behavior before actual copulation. The expulsion of a rival bird pair is often demonstrated by a triumphant demonstration outside. The bond between male and female is usually life-long. Only the female is, however, the nesting involved.\n\nMost species Europe, of Asia and 's North America are migratory wild. Different species of geese are mainly vegetarian, some species may even harm to farmers grazing their fields. Small are called goslings. The term gander applies only to male domestic geese. Several species of geese were domesticated. The Greylag Goose ( Anser anser ) is the origin of the European races, but in Asia the Swan Goose ( Anser cygnoides ) has an equally long history. Breeds of domestic geese are therefore from these two species irrespective or their hybrids are not sterile.\n\nThe Geese of Meidum, Egypt, is one of the oldest representations of geese. Aphrodite has repeatedly been shown in a chariot drawn by white geese or swans, but the ancient Greeks goose or swan carry the same symbolic. In Gauls is Belisama which is shown riding a goose. In Romans, the goose is associated with the cult of Minerva.\n\nEating a goose on St. Martin is a tradition in the north of Europe is to eat a goose on the day of St. Martin, namely November 11, at a time when the geese are fatter. Legend has it that Saint Martin of Tours, to avoid being named bishop was hiding among the geese, but he had been betrayed by their cackling. This tradition originated in Austria. For poor people, often expensive goose is replaced by another bird.\n\nPlace market geese in Sarlat-la-Caneda is a venue for fairs until xix th century. There are less than 30 years, was sold on this site these animals backyard.

The south-western tip of the lake belongs to the Swiss Canton of Geneva, the North Shore to the Swiss Canton of Vaud and the south bank largely to the French department of Haute-Savoie. Besides having the canton of Valais a small part of the eastern south shore. The lake is in Haut Lac, Grand Lac and Petit Lac divided.\n\nTwo major Swiss cities are located on the shores of Lake Geneva: On the southwest tip is the capital of the canton of Geneva, on the north shore of Lausanne, the capital of the canton Waadt / Vaud (VD). Other internationally famous cities are Montreux and Vevey on the northeastern shore. Largest French city on Lake Geneva is Thonon-les-Bains, the most famous Evian-les-Bains.\n\nCompared with many ducks geese have a low to absolutely no gender dimorphism. They are usually larger and long-necked as ducks. The food of geese is mostly vegetable. Swans feed on usually by searching the river bottom for water plants while real geese feed on grasses and seeds in the country. The boys of the true geese, however, are insectivores.\n\nGeese are life-long monogamous. When swans and chickens also goose the male is responsible for nesting, this task as the breeding takes over at the real geese alone as the female. The Black Swan is the only goose, in which the male participates in the business of breeding and even a brood patch has.\n\nAmong the eye-catching behaviors on the catch and wintering grounds include a pronounced diurnal rhythm.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!", "title": "Wild Geese Birds and Ducks at Lake Geneva of Switzerland", "publishedDate": "2014-01-19T13:20:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7EKokItq7QY", "description": "My Facebook Page - http://tinyurl.com/6385qw2 Blog - http://dtrockstar1.blogspot.com/\n\nChris Ashworth records the angry sound of a Corvette ZR1, an amazing exhaust sound.

In this episode Ruben Alonso is visiting Turku archipelago and he decides to know the authentic Finnish saunas where men and women enter naked. \n\nNo puedes irte de Finlandia sin practicar su deporte nacional: La Sauna. En este episodio Rub\u00e9n Alonso est\u00e1 visitando en archipi\u00e9lago de Turku y aprovecha para conocer las aut\u00e9nticas saunas finlandesas donde hombres y mujeres entran desnudos.\n\nLa sauna finlandesa es uno de los grandes atractivos de este pa\u00eds n\u00f3rdico. Cualquiera que visite este pa\u00eds has de participar en una de estas saunas si quiere decir que ha estado en Finlandia y que conoce la cultura finlandesa.\n\nLa sauna es una pr\u00e1ctica muy extendida en los pa\u00edses que rodean el Mar B\u00e1ltico, pero son las saunas finlandesas las que han adquirido mayos fama y reconocimiento.\n\nFinlandia es uno de los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s desarrollados de mundo en temas de tecnolog\u00eda, sin embargo las mejores saunas se encuentran en medio de los bosques en las riveras de los lagos o junto al mar b\u00e1ltico y carecen de todo tipo de adelantos, incluso carecen de electricidad o agua corriente. Es la manera que los finlandeses tienen de escapar de la rutina y el agobio de la ciudad; volviendo al ser m\u00e1s primitivo.\n\nLas saunas tradicionales se calientan a base le le\u00f1a y el vapor sale al echar agua en las piedras incandescentes. Las saunas se calientan hasta los ochenta o cien grados y se permanece en ellas unos diez o quince minutos. Pasado ese tiempo hay que sumergirse en agua fr\u00eda.\n\nEste proceso se repite tantas veces como el cuerpo lo aguante y en el proceso es imprescindible hidratarse permanentemente ya que en la sauna se pierde mucho l\u00edquido por el proceso de sudoraci\u00f3n.\n\nEn el episodio de hoy Ruben Alonso visita la ciudad universitaria de Turku, quinta ciudad en poblaci\u00f3n de Finlandia y en cuyo archipi\u00e9lago formado por docenas de peque\u00f1as islas que se rompen en el mar B\u00e1ltico, se encuentran algunas de las saunas m\u00e1s tradicionales del pa\u00eds.", "title": "Finnish Sauna - Sauna en Finlandia", "publishedDate": "2013-10-12T02:38:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ELLOUUMzQA", "description": "*****PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS VIDEO WAS MADE ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO.

This is a friendly musical conversation typical of what the tiels do a few times a day. Their \"music\" here consists basically of wolf whistles with some extensions. It is a \"language\" that combines features of each bird's whistling, which they've developed over three years as housemates. Sometimes one bird will respond to the other in imitation, sometimes they trade phrases, sometimes one will complete the other's phrase. \n\nOut of the wolf whistling, you can hear a much more rhythmic and regular song start to emerge. This is a specific song (or poem) of their own invention, which they both know. Chulo seems sleepy and mellow and less interested in following Bucky's youthful enthusiasm, although Chulo was the original author, and Bucky is whistling more-or-less in Chulo's key of B-flat (each bird has his preferred whistling key). \n\nAt one point you can hear Bucky feeding Chulo his line. The chirps at around 0:30 mark a break, after which Bucky starts a new \"verse.\" Bucky says the first line and waits for Chulo to respond; when he doesn't, Bucky prompts him by whistling the expected phrase at 0:38, and then Chulo finally comes in at 0:41. A third \"verse\" starts at 0:53.\n\nI had thought this was a courtship song, but now I'm thinking it may be a more generic friendship or flock solidarity song. There may be a gradation between the two in cockatiel culture as there is in our own.

Let's take a look at some of my fall favorites. Today I'm at Dogwood Ridge Farms in Poplarville where Barbara and Mike Levy are growing a variety of great cool season landscape plants. A favorite bedding plant that is related to the pansy is the viola. Violas are good choices for both landscape and containers. The Penny Citrus mix is a prolific flower producer. The flowers are displayed above the compact foliage in a way that says \"Hey, look at me.\" Flower colors include cream, orange, primrose, yellow and yellow frost. I really like the Penny Azure, which is a gorgeous white and bright blue flower with purple streaks. Since moving to south Mississippi, Telstar dianthus has become one of my very favorite cool season plants. There are varieties of colors that include carmine rose, pink, and purple picotee. Picotee describes a flower having a lighter or darker edge. Telstar dianthus will be 8 to 10 inches tall and wide and will tolerate cooler temperatures. The Telstar dianthus is a great partner with either pansy or viola. These pairings can maintain interest from fall through the following spring. For foliage interest in the cool season, consider Pink Chablis spotted dead nettle. Known botanically as Lamium maculatum, Pink Chablis is a low maintenance landscape plant. The leaves are a frothy confection of silver and green with cotton candy pink flowers that bloom into the cool season. This is also a great spiller plant for combination containers. You can't go wrong with these fall favorites to add color and interest to your cool-season landscape.

Label sizes range from 2.0\" wide and 1.0\" long to 4.0\" wide and 6.0\" long. Each system can produce variable-sized text, bar codes and graphic images at speeds programmable up to 16 ips.\n\nAfter a label is printed, it is automatically peeled from its liner and retained by vacuum on a non-contact, tamp-blow applicator pad. The tamp pad is mounted on a 90-degree rotary swing arm that reaches across a conveyor and blows the label to the front panel of the moving carton. Upon its return, a second label is printed and a separate straight-line stroke applies that label to the side of the carton to complete the cycle. Depending on label size, the system can maintain up to 40 cycles per minute at a placement accuracy of \u00b10.03\".\n\nThe system also can be configured to label side and rear panels, or single panels.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Porsche Carrera GT Lovely Acceleration & Little REV in Hamburg", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:04:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7EuZhqrYs68", "description": "Bhajan: Bhang Ragad De Thodi Gora\nAlbum: Gora Bolan Ka Ke Legi\nSinger: Surender Romio, Sushila Nagar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Bhakti channel is a bouquet (bunch) of bhajan, kirtan (devotional content) of different regional languages of India.
