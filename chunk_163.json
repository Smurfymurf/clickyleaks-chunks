The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "NC State vs Syracuse | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T23:49:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GtuOMNqpHo", "description": "All credit to Mrs. Holmes. \n\nAvailable directly here: http://tinyurl.com/eric-aic (To download, visit http://tinyurl.com/charactersummaries-aic, right click the one you want, and select \"Save link/target as...\")\nAll podcasts available here: http://tinyurl.com/englishpodcasts\n\n//MF", "title": "An Inspector Calls English Podcast: Characters - Eric Birling", "publishedDate": "2010-04-24T07:16:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Gtx0of4_BQ", "description": "Ariana's New Cover:' Baby it's cold outiside ' featuring Larry Lovestein.\nenjoy \u2665", "title": "Baby It's Cold Outside - Ariana Grande & Larry Lovestein (Mac Miller) - Lyrics HD", "publishedDate": "2012-12-25T16:30:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GuD7cGwOwM", "description": "http://tripwow.tripadvisor.com/tripwow/ta-00a1-2dc4-e8a0?ytv2=1 - Created at TripWow by TravelPod Attractions (a TripAdvisor\u2122 company)\n\nMorning Market Vientiane\nRead more at: http://www.travelpod.com/ad/Morning_Market-Vientiane\n\nTravel blogs from Morning Market:\n- \"... similar, but has more buddhist ornamental things added to it (guess you can picture if perfectly from that description) Went to the morning market (which is open all day), the very same market the Foreign office is nervous of, due to some bombings a ...\"\n- \"...

The client required a landscaped low maintenance garden with a miminalist planting style. Garden lighting was a must with plenty of lawn for the dog.\nOur landscapers started by removing the mature Grissellinia hedge that surrounded the garden and took up a lot of space. The low walls behind were then plastered and painted to give a clean effect. We then increasaed the wall height. Our landscapers achieved this by connecting posts to the wall and then covering the posts with horizontal 2x1 latts with one inch gaps between. The wall extension was then painted with Sadolins wood preservative. Wire was then placed through the posts at 6 inch intervals and tightened to create a climbing frame for Trachleospernum climbers. Entertainment areas were then created. The first patio was installed outside the double doors of the house using Cota brown limeston paving. Two circular patios were then created to the back garden connected byaa Ballylusk gravel circle. Our landscapers then created two paths either side of the garden using brown chinese cobbles for edging and Ballylusk gravel between. The gravel gave a nice sound when walked on and added to the ambiance of the garden. A lawn was then created between the two paths using instant roll out turf. Roll out turf is better than seeding cause it gives instant effect and is relatively weed free if bought from a good supplier, cost is more expensive but this is out weighed by the advantages. The edging of the paths and the patios provided the mowing edge which will reduce maintainence as the edge will always be intact and allows easier mowing. The beds were then planted with a minimal number of differant plant species. The beds on either side of the garden were planted with box hedging and privet lollipops at intervals. This looked very well and will be very easy to maintain. To the back of the garden we planted tree ferns underplanted with phormiums creating an architectural look. Bark chippings were laid in all beds to reduce weeding and to hold moisture in the soli by reducing evaporation. The house was then framed by tall terracotta planters planted with box balls, this looked very well adding a touch of class. Garden lighting was then installed using Hunza fittings which are the best on the market. The lights were placed under each of the lollipop privets and under the tree ferns at the back of the garden. Lighting is so important as it adds whole other dimension to the garden and makes the garden look so differant at night. The shed and dog kennel were then painted with sandtex old english green which looked very well and was worth the effort. The client was very happy with the results and wrote the following testimonial -", "title": "Wilfield Rd., Sandymount.

But, to our knowledge, some are yet to say that that he breaks into the headquarters of leading F1 teams overnight on daring smash'n'grab raids.\n \nUntil now. Shocking footage has reached Top Gear HQ of our tame racing driver at the home of the Lotus F1 team, first having his wicked way with a mini F1 car, and then redirecting one of the V8-engined 2013 cars that Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean drove with such distinction to... South Africa.\n \nIt may well a coincidence that Stig is due to appear at one of the biggest Top Gear Festivals ever in Durban, South Africa on 21-22 June.

The group ranks 100 U.S. cities by pollen load, allergy medicine use, and allergy doctors. See if your town is one of the Top 10 worst \"spring allergy capitals\" for 2013.\n\nNo. 10: Baton Rouge, La.\nThe capital of Louisiana is now an official spring allergy capital, too. Baton Rouge moves up to the top 10 this year. Some of the blame can go to the moist, humid air in this semitropical climate. Mold grows when humidity is high, setting off mold allergy symptoms.\n\nNo. 9: Oklahoma City, Okla.\nThe Sooner state has plenty of sunshine to spur plant growth -- as well as plenty of irritating spring pollen. Pollen levels tend to be worse in Sunbelt states and on warm, windy days. You can find the count for your area at local news web sites or the non-profit National Allergy Bureau web site. After being outdoors on a high pollen day, take a shower, wash your hair, and change your clothes.\n\nNo. 8: Memphis, Tenn.\nSpring allergy season has people singing the blues in Memphis. The city of Elvis also prides itself on its mighty oak trees -- each of which gives off thousands of pollen particles. Tree pollen can travel miles on a breeze. With a moist climate that also makes mold more likely to grow, Memphis is a place of sneezing and wheezing.\u00a0\n\nNo. 7: Dayton, Ohio\nDayton's rank moved up from No. 10 last year. This hometown to Orville and Wilbur Wright is sometimes called the \"Birthplace of Aviation.\" Pollen takes flight in the early morning and peaks between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The best time to be outdoors is in the late afternoon or on cool, wet days when pollen counts are low.\n\nNo. 6: Wichita, Kan.\nThis city on the prairie has strong spring winds that blow the pollen across the plains. Whether your town is far inland or close to water, pollen can drift in and cause allergies.\n\nNo. 5: Louisville, Ky.\nThis port city on the Ohio River -- home of the Louisville Slugger and the Kentucky Derby -- often ranks among the top allergy capitals. Louisville is in the bluegrass region of the state, but grasses are just one source of pollen. Trees put out their pollen in late winter and spring, while grasses do so in late spring and summer.\n\nNo. 4: McAllen, Texas\nThink the American Southwest has a dry climate that will help your allergies? McAllen, Texas, proves that pollen can spread anywhere. Located at the southern tip of the state, McAllen is often hot and humid in the springtime. Weather and humidity affect pollen, so check the day's pollen counts before you head outdoors.\n\nNo. 3: Chattanooga, Tenn.\nChattanooga moves up four notches to No. 3. The city is perhaps most famous for being in the valley below Lookout Mountain, and for the steam-powered \"choo-choo\" that once went through town. Lower the amount of pollen that gets inside your home by:\n- Keeping windows and doors shut\n- Setting the air conditioning to recirculate\n\nNo. 2: Knoxville, Tenn.\nAfter a few years at the top of the spring allergy list, Knoxville drops down a spot. This eastern Tennessee city has plenty of charm and scenic mountain beauty, but it has plenty of pollen, too. Allergy relief can come from reducing your pollen contact and from many different medicines. Your health care provider is a good place to get advice.\n\nNo. 1: Jackson, Miss.\nJackson moves up three spots to top the allergy list. It's crisscrossed by the Pearl River and the Natchez Trace Parkway, a leafy, scenic drive that was created by Native Americans and early settlers. With its diverse forests, prairies, and croplands, it is also a hot spot for allergy action. Did you know that 40 million Americans have indoor/outdoor allergies? The most common outdoor triggers include pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds.\n\nCan You Escape Allergies?\nStaying indoors may give you some relief from spring pollen. But be aware of indoor allergy triggers, too, such as dust mites, mold, pet dander, and cockroaches. Keep surfaces clean. Bare floors are better than carpet. Air conditioning can lower moisture in the air to help prevent mold growth and curb dust mites. Tempted to move away? In a few years, you're likely to develop allergies to plants in your new city.\n\nGardening With Allergies\nBelieve it or not, you can still enjoy gardening even if you have allergies. Choose plants whose pollen is spread by insects, such as azaleas, roses, daffodils, dogwoods, and pear trees. Pollen from these sources tends to be heavier and less likely to become airborne. Wear gloves and a face mask. Wash your hands and rinse your eyes when you come indoors.\n\nSource: http://www.webmd.com", "title": "10 Worst Cities for Spring Allergies", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15T08:41:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HSSDsHpU_0", "description": "Music video by Kasia Kowalska performing Bede Jak.

Rupinder Singh scored from a penalty corner securing India's win in the last minute of the match. The Olympic champions, who had lost their quarter final 3-2 to the Netherlands, opened the scoring thanks to team-captain Oliver Korn (4') picking up a rebound in the Indian circle and hammering it into the goal. Thilo Stralkowski (6') doubled the German lead a couple of minutes later when scoring from a penalty corner. His fourth goal in this competition made the 26-year-old new top scorer for his team.\n\nMandeep Singh (18') made the home crowd cheer when finishing a promising Indian counter-attack by a successful shot from the top of the circle. However, Benjamin Wess (27') added another one for Germany, securing a 3-1 lead at halftime. \"Getting structure is the key to development in this side. We need to find a way to combine Indian style and flair with technical structure\" said Roelant Oltmans, India's director of performance, at halftime.\n\nIndia got the better start in the second half and shocked the European champions with a double-strike from Rupinder Singh (39') and Mandeep Singh (41') to level the score to 3-3. The host nation came close to taking the lead when a deflected ball hit the German goal post. Mandeep Singh (53') added his third goal of the day when putting India ahead 4-3. This goal seemed to be a wake-up call for Germany who equalised through a penalty corner goal from Martin H\u00e4ner (55'). \n\nARGENTINA\n\n1 VIVALDI Juan (GK), 2 PEILLAT Gonzalo, 3 BERGNER Ignacio, 4 GILARDI Juan Ignacio, 5 IBARRA Pedro, 7 CALLIONI Facundo, 8 REY Lucas (C), 10 PAREDES Matias, 12 VILA Lucas,\n16 ORTIZ Ignacio, 17 LOPEZ Juan Martin, 18 BARREIROS Guido, 19 AGULLEIRO Juan, \n21 CAMACHO PANDO Santiago, 22 REY Matias, 26 MAZZILLI Agustin, 27 ROSSI Lucas &\n30 BERTHOLD Joaquin (GK).\n\nINDIA\n\n3 SINGH Rupinder,  5 KHADANGBAM Kothajit, 7 SINGH Manpreet, 8 SINGH Sardar (C), 9 WALMIKI Yuvraj, 10 SINGH Dharamvir, 11 SINGH Mandeep, 12 VOKKALIGA RAMACHANDRA Raghunath, 15 SANNUVANDA KUSHALAPPA Uthappa, 16 PARATTU RAVEENDRAN Sreejesh (GK), 24 SOWMARPET VITALACHARYA Sunil, 25 MUKKATIRA BIDAPPA Aiyappa, 26 LAKRA Birendra, 28 SINGH Harjot (GK), 29 KANGUJAM Chinglensana, 30 ROHIDAS Amit, 31 AFFAN Yousuf AND 32 THIMMAIAH Chandanda. \n\nWelcome to the FIH YouTube Channel where you can watch all the amazing skills, fearless keepers and incredible goals.\n\nFor the Power, Precision and Beauty of World Hockey subscribe here - http://bit.ly/12FcKAW \n\nWith master class videos and behind the scenes access you can get to know the star players from around the globe as they compete in the Hockey World League, World Cup and Champions Trophy.\n\nVisit FIH on:\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/fihockey  \nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/fih_hockey\"", "title": "Germany vs India - Men's Hero Hockey World League Final India 5th/8th Place [17/1/2014]", "publishedDate": "2014-01-17T12:58:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HUuezZiFkM", "description": "Lycopene isn't just one of the most popular members of the carotenoid family; it's also one of the most beneficial.

The tentacles may be contracted to very short (especially when the animal is actively swimming) or extended to twice the bell length (especially when the animal is drifting).  As with many hydromedusae, it has a clearly developed velum.   Nematocysts on the tentacles are not grouped into rings.  Ocelli around the bell margin, at the base of the tentacles, are ringed with red which can be clearly seen.  It has 4 unbranched radial canals which have many (15-25 pairs of) lateral diverticula.  The ring canal may or may not have several short centripetal diverticula.  The fingerlike or sausagelike gonads hang down from the subumbrellar surface, under the radial canals near the juncture of the stomach with the radial canals, in 4 groups.  Usually there are less than 15 gonads.  The bell is transparent with white parts but the gonads and some other internal organs may be yellow, yellow-brown, reddish-brown, or purple.  The manubrium, which is long and has 4 short frilly lips, hangs from a rounded \"gastric peduncle\".  Average size is 2-3 cm, and up to 5 (10) cm tall.  Older individuals may have green algae growing on the exumbrella.\n\nHow to Distinguish from Similar Species: Ptychogena lactea and Staurophora mertensi are similar except that their bells are much wider than high and their gonads do not hang down into the subumbrellar space.  Polyorchis haplus does not have lateral diverticula on the radial canals.\n\nGeographical Range:  Aleutian Islands, Alaska to Sea of Cortez, Mexico\n\nDepth Range:\n\nHabitat:  A coastal species (nearshore), especially in bays.\n\nBiology/Natural History:  This is a common hydromedusa along the west coast.  It can often be seen in midwater but more often swims near the bottom, especially around eelgrass.  The jelly eats caprellid amphipods and other small crustaceans which are common on eelgrass, as well as worms and crustaceans from the bottom and small plankton.  Sexes are separate.  The polyp stage of this species is either very small or unknown, and the medusa may develop directly from a planula larva.  This species is large for a hydromedusa, and some of the largest hydromedusae are in this genus.  The medusa is common in some years and nearly absent in others.", "title": "Jellyfish Family - Escondido Beach Scuba Diving", "publishedDate": "2012-05-13T05:04:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HZ8O9zW3b0", "description": "Grateful Dead classic", "title": "Brown Eyed Women and Red Grenadine sung by Brad Sondahl", "publishedDate": "2013-05-17T00:22:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HZHFtMbXv8", "description": "So until Kimlinh \"Hnilmik\" Tran introduced the concept of Elision Eloquence to me, I thought this was actually a BAD habit in narration that had to be broken, rather than encouraged.

So they started growing flowers and began to prosper. Let's see how they go about it.\n STORY:\nThere's an increasing demand for flowers around the world and these villagers are set to cash in. \nThey have adapted the latest techniques in floriculture that have been made available to them by the government of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n The high altitude of the region, cold winds and moist soil that are most suitable for floriculture have acted as a catalyst with low temperatures preferred for the buds to bloom.\n\n [Pyare Lal Verma, Floriculturist]:\n\"The revolution in the flower business came in 91-92. Initially we were growing vegetables but we opted for floriculture seeking benefits in it. It's been 10 to 15 years now.\"\n\n Om Prakash is one of the pioneer floriculturists of Mahog who attributes his success to devotion and hard work.\n\n [Om Prakash, Floriculturist]:\n\"One who works hard earns more dividends. Our economic condition has improved. We are providing better education to our children, owning vehicles and are accessing the Internet. We are handing over this profession to the future generations.\"\n\n Floriculture is a totally skill-based farming. From sowing the seeds to packaging, everything is done by the farmers themselves and it has helped them bring down their production costs.\n\n [Narendra Bragta, Horticulture Minister, Himachal Pradesh]:\n\"The flowers like Geraniums, Carnation, Marigold and Lily are in huge demand in the five star hotels. At the field level, we are technically carrying an awareness campaign in the region through regular interaction.\" \n\n The farmers also produce exquisite commercial varieties of flowers that are much sought after in domestic as well as in European markets.\n\n Apart from Mahog, over 2500 farmers in other villages of Himachal Pradesh have taken up floriculture and are operating through 48 cooperative societies.", "title": "Floriculture Thrives in India", "publishedDate": "2008-07-27T21:48:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HtbGZGBaJs", "description": "Sports jingoism..

But some Swedes feel it's being taken to extremes. It has the highest proportion of working women in the world and some two-thirds of university degrees are earned by women. New mothers and fathers both get generous parental leave. \n\nGender role neutrality initiatives, however, some feel are being exaggerated.\n\nThere's a politician who proposed that men should be required by law to urinate in a sitting position - partly because it leaves toilets cleaner and promotes prostate health, partly as an appeal for reason. \n\nThat politician, Viggo Hansen, told us: \"When my son was in kindergarten, they tried to force him to pee standing up, when we had taught him to pee sitting down. When the school let him sit down to pee, there was no problem. I had read about a school in Norway that officially banned boys' stand-up peeing. Lots of people's reaction was that was taking away boys' right to be boys.\"\n\nAnn Helena Rudberg joined the feminist movement in the 1970s, to fight for women's rights because she saw her mother suffer violence at home. Today she argues women have equal rights and that feminist political parties are taking things too far.\n\nRudberg said: \"It's a power struggle between men and women. And the effect of that is that on one side we have women and on the other side men. And this is not good for the children or for anyone.\"\n\nAt a school in Stockholm named 'Egalia', teaching gender equality is a priority. Boys and girls are encouraged not to be limited by stereotypical roles or games. And since last year, there is a new word in the Swedish dictionary: \"hen\", which is a neutral pronoun for \"he\" or \"she\". Not everyone agrees about that.\n \nSchool director Lotta Rajalin said: \"They think we are going to change girls to boys and boys to girls and that's of course not what we are doing. We like to give every human being the same rights, the same possibilities, the same responsibilities. And that is a question of democracy.\"\n\nSome critics say Sweden's government is taking a feminist agenda to an almost radical level. Others who also take International Women's Day seriously say the fight for gender equality is far from over.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Has Swedish feminism gone too far?", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T18:59:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9HwjbTNH3ss", "description": "This Tune is from the Aether Mod for the Indie Game Minecraft which was made by Markus Persson aka Notch\n\nAll the Credit goes to Emile van Krieken for the Music and the Aether Team for the Image\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLinks:\n\nAether Mod:\n\nhttp://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/893629-100-aether-v104-01-launch-bug-fixed-bug-fixes-crystal-trees-enchanted-grass-white-apples/\n\nor\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AetherMod\n\nMinecraft:\n\nhttp://www.minecraft.net/\n\nDownload Soundtrack:\n\nhttp://emilevankrieken.bandcamp.com/album/the-aether-soundtrack", "title": "Minecraft [ Aether Mod ] Music | Aether 3 (by Emile van Krieken)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-14T20:33:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Hx2Sa3WzqU", "description": "Learn more: http://www.policonomics.com/utility-maximisation/\n\nThis video explains how utility maximisation works, both from the analytical and graphical points of view.

The condition is especially rife in feminine Huskies though males will dig still.

SiC is especially important to the nuclear industry because of its relatively inert matrix, high temperature capabilities, ideal topological arrangement and corrosion resistance. The nuclear industry uses SiC to make nuclear fuel pellets, such as tristructural-isotropic fuel, and to build reactor containment walls because of its heat transfer properties; and to store inert gas fission products released during fission because of its pore structure. \n\nScientists at University of Washington, Seattle, prepared the porous samples by foaming a polycarbosilane polymer followed by conversion to SiC. The pore morphology is controlled through modifications of the polymer, which has a tendency to go from elliptical to spherical pores or vice versa depending on the polymer modification. The thermal diffusivity of the porous SiC is being studied as an effect of pore morphology and increasing crystallinity, the degree of structural order. Part of the research effort included imaging with EMSL's X-ray computed tomography, or XCT, to create 3-D images of the porous sample. \n\nThe project is supported by the Nuclear Energy University Program. The research team involved in the imaging portion of the study included scientists Chuck Henager and Weilin Jiang from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; UW Professor Rajendra Bordia and student Shelly Arreguin; and Tamas Varga, EMSL. \n\nRead more about XCT: http://1.usa.gov/10wRJjE and EMSL capabilities: http://1.usa.gov/13ZsgEr. \n\nCredits: Tamas Varga, EMSL scientist, imaged the core sample using XCT; high school research intern Niraj Suresh with help from former intern Lexor Adams created the animation; and Cortland Johnson, PNNL Branding & Creative Services, produced the final video.

Kidney function and drug levels in the blood may be monitored with blood tests during treatment.

Thimerosal is a chemical that contains a small amount of mercury and is used in some vaccines and other medicines to keep them from spoiling.  It prevents bacteria and fungi from growing in vaccines that come in multi-dose vials so they remain effective until the last dose is used. Source: http://www.toronto.ca/health/immune_thimerosal.htm\n\nTwo-thirds of the vaccines made for the 200809 flu season, 100 million of them, contain full-dose thimerosal, an organomercury compound, which is 49% mercury by weight. (An unidentified number of the other 50 million vaccines contain either \"no\" or \"trace\" amounts of thimerosal.) It is used to disinfect the vaccine. Each one of these 100 million flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury, a mercury content that is 50,000 part per billion, 250 times more than the Environmental Protection Agencys safety limit. Mercury is a neurotoxin, which has a toxicity level 1,000 times that of lead. \n\nMercury is the second most toxic non- radioactive element to man, perhaps the best visual example of what low-levels of mercury can do to the brain is seen in a videotaped experiment by scientists at the University of Calgary. \"Over the next thirty minutes, the neurite membrane underwent rapid degeneration, leaving behind the denuded neurofibrils seen here,\" the narration on the tape said. \"In contrast, other heavy metals added to this concentration - such as aluminum, lead, cadmium and manganese - did not produce this effect.\" See: Mercury In Vaccines Causes Brain Cell Damage -  University of Calgary experiment Source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fcgq584Rss", "title": "TorontoChange Presents - The Flu Shot: Exposed", "publishedDate": "2008-11-19T08:29:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9IjcQXZHF7Q", "description": "Mary's Danish - Killjoy.  *Audio*\n\nFirst track (#1) on the 1992 album \"American Standard\".\n\nKILLJOY\nWords and music by Mary's Danish\n\nYou're a killjoy\nCandy red lips speaking in tongues\nYou're a killjoy\nSuffocate the rising sun\nJoy--you always take it back\nto the place where pride and vice are one\n\nYou're a killjoy\nGet your ugly sorrow off my back\nYou're a killjoy\nSpoiler always paints it black\nRide your misery to town\nThe dirt flies high from the wheels\nof your Cadillac\n\nLoad your dirty magazine\nIsolate yourself from life\nTake all the color from your dreams\nYour world is pins and strife", "title": "Killjoy - Mary's Danish (from 1992's 'American Standard')  *Audio + Lyrics*", "publishedDate": "2010-01-27T21:36:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9IjheKo-Z_g", "description": "A short fun video showing a children's train pulling giant fruit freight.

During an interview with VH1, Lee said, \"I wrote the chorus on the guitar when I was about 16. I always thought it was a cool chorus, but I never used it for anything. I started playing it on the piano and the verses came out. I have a pile of pieces stowed away in my mind that maybe I'll use some day. In a way it's an old song, but not really. It grew up.\"\n\nIn another interview with MTV Italy, Lee said, \"It's not literal, it's not literal about the drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about numbness and happiness and sort of like, it's me looking at happiness in a negative way because I've always been, you know, kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's like this fight within the song of like 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because at the end of the song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.\"\n\nThe drug itself, lithium carbonate, is typically used as a mood stabilizer to prevent acute manic behavior patients with bipolar disorder suffer.\n\nLyrics:\n\nLithium - don't want to lock me up inside \nLithium - don't want to forget how it feels without \nLithium - I want to stay in love with my sorrow \nOh but God I want to let it go \n\nCome to bed, don't make me sleep alone \nCouldn't hide the emptiness - you let it show \nNever wanted it to be so cold \nJust didn't drink enough to say you love me \n\nI can't hold on to me \nWonder what's wrong with me \n\nLithium - don't want to lock me up inside \nLithium - don't want to forget how it feels without \nLithium - I want to stay in love with my sorrow \n\nDon't want to let it lay me down this time \nDrown my will to fly \nHere in the darkness I know myself \nCan't break free until I let it go \nLet me go \n\nDarling, I forgive you after all \nAnything is better than to be alone \nAnd in the end I guess I had to fall \nAlways find my place among the ashes \n\nI can't hold on to me \nWonder what's wrong with me \n\nLithium - don't want to lock me up inside \nLithium - don't want to forget how it feels without \nLithium - I want to stay in love with my sorrow \nOh but God I want to let it go\n\nEnjoy!", "title": "Evanescence - Lithium (Live on David Letterman's Show) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-09-13T02:54:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9IkzVbUM0EU", "description": "The Chase Family featuring Dashiell Chase sing their arrangement of Do You Hear What I Hear at Broadway Presbyterian Church, Christmas Eve 2013 \nDavid Chase, Paula Leggett Chase, Kyler Chase, Dashiell Chase", "title": "DASHIELL CHASE with The Chase Family \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\"", "publishedDate": "2013-12-27T19:47:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9IlAPZjDz_k", "description": "WWII T17E1 Staghounds used by Canadian reconnaissance regiments in WWII 1943-1965\nSee Plylist: http://www.youtube.com/user/TilTuli#grid/user/C302AF405EC8D0E4\nCanadian War Museum, Ottawa http://www.warmuseum.ca\n\nTilTul http://tiltul.com LinksYouWantToRemember\nCIMG1015.AVI", "title": "WWII T17E1 Staghounds used by Canadian reconnaissance regiments in WWII (1943-1965)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T00:00:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9IlL7TXturA", "description": "I matched my personal best mangrove snapper with a nice 18 incher caught on the bridge leading to no name key.

Most frightening of all, stated ACT UP dissidents, was Hernandez's threat to implement Direct Observational Therapy (DOT) to ensure proper dosing of the AIDS community with these drugs that, activists note, have been on the market for less than a year. It is alleges that virulent strains of HIV can form in patients who fail to consistently take these powerful agents on schedule.\n\nIn such a scenario D.O.T. would mandate by law that all HIV-positive San Franciscans show up at a designated health clinic to consume state-prescribed AIDS drugs in the presence of a public health official. If a patient misses a scheduled dosing or refuses to take the pills, he or she would be jailed and forced to comply. Hernandez admitted in the article that in order for DOT to work \"you would have to track everybody and [the patient's HIV status] would have to be reportable as tuberculosis is.\" \n\nAs Tuesday's Health Commission meeting got underway, stealth activists strategically dispersed throughout the audience, leapt to their feet in unison, blew whistles, scattered fake death certificates that accused Hernandez of \"mass murder\" and chanted \"D.O.T's A Bitter Pill To Force-Feed Toxic Drugs That Kill!\"\n\nSimultaneously, three members of the ACT UP San Francisco affinity group SPITT (Stop Promoting Immunosuppressive Toxic Treatments) stormed the Health Commission panel, jumped on the conference table and unfurled a banner emblazoned with skull and crossbones that read \"Poisons Don't Prevent AIDS.\" Activists presented Hernandez with a statement that demands as others spat in the faces of representatives from the city's AIDS office for remaining silent in the face of what they term a \"sinister scheme.\" Activists escaped before the arrival of authorities; there were no arrests. The Health Commission meeting was delayed approximately 20 minutes. \n\n\"As a Latino gay man I am outraged that Dr. Hernandez would propose forcing anyone to take dangerous compounds that cause severe side effects, that harm the immune system and that can kill if mixed with everyday drugs like Seldane,\" stated HIV-positive activist Ronnie Burk. \"We know that these drug pushers don't have a scientific leg to stand on when promoting fascist schemes like D.O.T.

This species breeds in much of Europe and Asia and parts of north Africa. It is resident in the mildest parts of its range, but otherwise migrates to Africa. It has a toehold in Alaska as a scarce breeder. In the British Isles the darker sub-species the Pied Wagtail (M. a. yarrellii) predominates.\n\nThe White Wagtail is an insectivorous bird of open country, often near habitation and water. It prefers bare areas for feeding, where it can see and pursue its prey. In urban areas it has adapted to foraging on paved areas such as car parks. It nests in crevices in stone walls and similar natural and man-made structures.\n\nThe White Wagtail is the national bird of Latvia.\n\nWhite Wagtail was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original name of Motacilla alba. The Latin genus name originally meant \"little mover\", but certain medieval writers thought it meant \"wag-tail\", giving rise to a new Latin word cilla for \"tail\". The specific epithet alba is Latin for \"white\".\n\nWithin the wagtail genus Motacilla, the White Wagtail's closest relatives appear to be other black-and-white wagtails such as the Japanese Wagtail, Motacilla grandis, and the White-browed Wagtail, Motacilla madaraspatensis (and possibly the Mekong Wagtail, Motacilla samveasnae, the phylogenetic position of which is mysterious), with which it appears to form a superspecies. However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data suggests that the White Wagtail is itself polyphyletic or paraphyletic (i.e. the species is not itself a single coherent grouping). Other phylogenetic studies using mtDNA still suggest that there is considerable gene flow within the races and the resulting closeness makes Motacilla alba a single species. Some studies have suggested the existence of only two groups : the alboides group, with M. a. alboides, M. a. leucopsis and M. a. personata; and the alba group, with M. a. alba, M. a. yarrellii, M. a. baicalensis, M. a. ocularis, M. a. lugens, and M. a. subpersonata.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It is most noticeable on the buttocks and thighs, and usually occurs after puberty.\n\n\nCellulite is also known as adiposis edematosa, dermopanniculosis deformans, status protrusus cutis, and gynoid lipodystrophy in the medical field and as orange peel syndrome, cottage cheese skin, hail damage, and the mattress phenomenon in colloquial language. \n\nCellulite is often classified using three grades:\nGrade 1 cellulite sees no clinical symptoms, but a microscopic examination of cells from the area detects underlying anatomical changes.\nGrade 2 cellulite requires the skin to show pallor (pastiness), be lower temperature, and have decreased elasticity, in addition to anatomical changes noted by microscopic examinations.\nGrade 3 cellulite has visible roughness of the skin (like an orange peel) along with all grade 2 signs.\nAlthough cellulite can affect both sexes, it is much more common in females, mainly because they are more likely to have particular types of fat and connective tissue. \nWhat causes cellulite? \nThe causes of cellulite are not well understood, but there are several theories that have been put forth as explanations. Among these are: \nHormonal factors - hormones likely play an important role in cellulite development. Many believe estrogen, insulin, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones, and prolactin are part of the cellulite production process. \nGenetics - certain genes are required for cellulite development. Genes may predispose an individual to particular characteristics associated with cellulite, such as gender, race, slow metabolism, distribution of fat just underneath the skin, and circulatory insufficiency. \nDiet - people who eat too much fat, carbohydrates, or salt and too little fiber are likely to have greater amounts of cellulite. \nLifestyle factors - cellulite may be more prevalent in smokers, those who do not exercise, and those who sit or stand in one position for long periods of time. \nClothing - underwear with tight elastic across the buttocks (limiting blood flow) may contribute to the formation of cellulite.\nHow can cellulite be removed? \nThere are several therapies that have been suggested to remove cellulite, but none have been supported in the scientific or medical literature. \n\nTherapeutic methods that are physical or mechanical include: pneumatic massages, massages that stimulate lymphatic flow, heat therapy, ultrasound, radio frequency therapy, magnetic therapy, radial waves therapy, endermologie, electrical stimulation\n\nUnfortunately, none of these methods have been scientifically proven to work.\n\nA second class of cellulite removal strategies consists of drugs that are supposed to act on fatty tissues. There is a wide range of pharmacological agents which are used for getting rid of cellulite, including: methylxanthines (caffeine and theobromine), pentoxifylline, beta-agonists and adrenaline, alpha-antagonists, amino acids, ginkgo biloba, rutin, Indian chestnut\n\nPeople with cellulite have tried to apply these agents topically, orally, or by injection, but none have been proved effective. \n\nSome people with cellulite wear special clothing called compression garments to reduce the appearance of cellulite. These garments try to compress arteries and increase blood and lymph flow to reduce visual cellulite. \n\nHow can cellulite be prevented? \nEating healthy, low fat foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fiber can help one to avoid cellulite. Similarly exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing stress are recommended to prevent cellulite. In addition wearing thongs, boyshorts, or looser fitting undergarments can prevent cellulite that might form due to tight elastic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JEBtN1Jqe0\n\nSearch Terms:\ncarbonation causes cellulite\ncause of cellulite\ncauses cellulite\ncauses de la cellulite\ncauses for cellulite\ncauses of cellulite\ncauses of cellulites\ncellulite cause\ncellulite causes and cures\ncellulite causes and treatment\ncellulite causes and treatments\ndairy causes cellulite\ndoes birth control cause cellulite\ndoes coffee cause cellulite\nles causes de la cellulite\nmain causes of cellulite\nrunning causes cellulite\nsugar causes cellulite\nwhat cause cellulite\nwhat causes cellulite\nwhat causes cellulite in pregnancy\nwhat causes cellulite in women\nwhat causes cellulite on buttocks\nwhat causes cellulite on stomach\nwhat causes cellulite on thighs\nwhat is cellulite and what causes it\nwhat is cellulite caused by\nwhat is the cause of cellulite\nbelly cellulite causes\nbirth control cause cellulite\ncause de la cellulite\ncause of cellulite in women\ncause of cellulite on thighs\ncellulite causes\ncellulite on stomach cause\ndoes caffeine cause cellulite\nmain cause of cellulite\ncellulite solutions\ncellulite solution\nsolution cellulite", "title": "What Causes Cellulite - Cellulite Solutions", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T12:58:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JEwid6UoOs", "description": "University of Illinois Nutrition and Wellness Educator, Mary Liz Wright, demonstrates how to properly wash leafy greens.", "title": "How to Wash Leafy Greens", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T20:46:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JFUhxJw5hY", "description": "Copyright ZICO Company\nPublished 1996", "title": "Bujar Qamili - Mi dhe flake mallit tim (audio version)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T17:41:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JFZ-2zEFks", "description": "", "title": "chris loeb", "publishedDate": "2010-11-11T04:07:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JFgC3Ub10E", "description": "From the DVD \"An Intimate Lesson With Tony Rice\" (Source VHS)\n\n\"Church Street Blues\" is written by Norman Blake\n\nhttp://www.tonyrice.com/", "title": "Tony Rice - Church Street Blues", "publishedDate": "2007-04-19T21:06:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JFscjLBDLo", "description": "Fantastic new track from artist called Logix featuring BrainFR33ZE.

The bright, flashing sparks are most likely (?) the iron being consumed.  \nThis run made a 2 1/2 pound ingot. \nTo see a sketch of the furnace design, go here; http://www.knifemakerforums.com/showthread.php?t=66", "title": "Making a tungsten alloy with thermite/boiling iron", "publishedDate": "2009-03-28T20:03:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JbUCf-0mj4", "description": "Pakai Hijab Modern : http://tinyurl.com/mx2rqhe\n\nAssalamualaikum, mulia la seorang perempuan yg slalu Pakai Hijab..Berikut Nak KAmi BAgikan Tutorial Terkini Pakai Hijab...Thanks :)\n\ntutorial tudung al humaira   de zahra tudung   tutorial tudung bawal youtube   tudung bidang 50   tudung bawal labuh   al humaira tudung   blog jual tudung   fashion untuk hijab   hijab clothing online shopping   a hijab   hijab hijab hijab   tudung bidang 60   tudung manik   how to sew tudung   hijab fashion online   hijabs online malaysia   hijib hijib   fashionable hijabs online   shopping online hijab   fashion hijab indonesia   malaysian hijabs   tudung humaira   tudung al humaira   tudung bawal bidang 50   tudung bawal shawl   tudung bawal baru   shawl al humaira   hijab a   youtube tutorial tudung bawal   tudung tribal   tutorial tudung bawal terkini   tutorial tudung labuh   tutorial pakai tudung shawl   shawl tutorial al humaira   al humaira hijab tutorial   tutorial shawl al humaira   tudung shawl labuh   hijab tutorial tudung bawal   youtube tudung bawal   tutorial memakai tudung bawal   tudung bawal tribal   al humaira tutorial   tudung online singapore   hijabiste fashion   hijap fashion   youtube tudung   tudung ustazah siti nor bahyah   al humaira shawl tutorial   shawl tutorial by al-humaira   tudung sifon   tutorial al humaira   tudung youtube   tudung bidang   how to wear tudung bawal   the tudung bawal   square tudung   tudung unik   bawal tudung tutorial   tudung labuh bidang 50   bawal tudung   shawl tudung bawal   tribal tudung   tudung bawal labuh bidang 50   model tudung al humaira   tudung 50 bidang   al shawl   tutorial bawal tribal   tudung hijab styles   cara buat tudung ariani   klip tudung   tudung labuh tutorial   gaya terbaru tudung bawal   tribal tudung bawal   latest tudung bawal   tudung bawal collection   shawl latest   tudung tribal bawal   tudung 3   tutorial square hijab   hijab tudung bawal   tudung tribal shawl   hijab square   latest shawl tutorial   tudung hijab labuh   scarf sweethoney hijab tutorial   tudung baik   latest hijab tutorial   youtube how to wear hijab   square tudung tutorial   hijab tutorial al humaira   hijabtutorial.com   tutorial hijab tribal   tutorial hijab baru   wear head scarf   tutorial hijab al humaira   new head scarf styles   youtube how to wear a hijab   youtube.com hijab tutorial   head scarf tutorials   tutor hijab sifon   hijab youtube tutorial   this is hijab", "title": "cara pakai Tudung paling mudah - Tudung Ruffle Style", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T01:40:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JbWInqfKLk", "description": "Demo CD: http://www.PeopleStreme.com\n\nThird generation online Employee Engagement survey systems improve employee engagement and retention.", "title": "Employee Engagement", "publishedDate": "2009-04-24T02:16:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JbdGZwKF58", "description": "Betula utilis jacquemontii Doorenbos or Betula jacquemontii the Himalayan Birch tree. http://www.ornamental-trees.co.uk/ornamental-trees-c18/betula-utilis-jacquemontii-doorenbos-p45", "title": "Betula utilis jacquemontii Doorenbos", "publishedDate": "2011-02-08T14:38:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JcFgL2qO9Y", "description": "Cursive - The Recluse\nfrom The Ugly Organ\nDirected by Mike Malone", "title": "Cursive - The Recluse", "publishedDate": "2006-09-06T21:40:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JcMPW5kEgA", "description": "This is the preview video of a track called Psychopathia sexualis, with the same name of Krafft-Ebing's book.

Besides Mercury, can you guess another detrimental chemical in HFCS?\n\n\nWelcome to this edition of Medical Myth buster  I am Dr. Ryan Bentley, and today we are going to be discussing part two of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). In the Last episode we discussed that the majority of HFCS is made with Mercury and that it is bad for Brain development as mercury is toxic to the body. I had a lot of correspondences from doctors and the general public who said, \"I had know idea that there is mercury in HFCS, I just thought it made you fat because of the sugar. They are correct that excess sugar, specifically in the from of HFCS can add on extra pounds, But there is more to the story than just excess sugar, that results in excess calories that is causing the extra weight gain. Can you guess what the other detrimental chemical is that makes HFCS so unhealthy? It is Atrazine.  Atrazine is the main fertilizer used in the production of corn. Since production of HFCS uses cornstarch, can you guess where the Atrazine is going to show up? In the HFCS. The epidemic of Obesity in American has been well documented, and it correlates very well with the increase consumption of sugar as you see in this graph, I would like to remind you the majority sugar in take in the US is in the for of HFCS. However, what is not well documented is the health effects of Atrazine exposure from HFCS, and I would like to shed some light on this subject for you. Atrazine has been shown to decreased basal metabolic rate, increased body weight,  increase intra-abdominal fat and increase insulin resistance (which leads to type II diabetes) without changing food intake or physical activity level. Just look at the trends of Atrazine exposure and the trends of obesity.  Can you see the correlation? Atrazine has also caused frogs to become hermaphrodites, with both male (testes) and female (ovaries) sex organs. Additionally it causes frogs to have other birth defect such as extra or missing limbs. The Environmental protection agency says that 3 ppb of atrazine is safe in our drinking water. But I would like you to note that it only takes 0.1 ppb to cause a frog to become a hermaphrodite. Atrazine has also been show to affect our immune system. Notice that this research shows a decrease in the immune system at 6.5 ppb, which is not much high that what is deemed safe in our drinking water, and when you add the HFCS consumption to that 3 ppb, all of a sudden we decrease our ability to fight viral infections. Chew on that as you eat your holiday sweets during flu season. Lastly, Atrazine affects our hormones. We can see that as the dosage goes up, the spikes in luteinizing hormone decreases. Which significantly impacts our hormone system. This journal article says, \"We present the evidence that endocrine disruptors (like Atrazine) have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology. Results from animal models, human clinical observations, and epidemiological studies converge to implicate endocrine-disrupting chemicals EDCs as a significant concern to public health. With the information I have presented to you I hope you realize that \"HFCS is not just Corn sugar, and the body can not tell the difference. HFCS effects go beyond just being a sugar as it has devastating effects on our body.\n\nUntil next time, Merry Christmas and God Bless\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JdD_qeEFKE", "title": "Dr. Ryan Bentley MedicalMyth Buster regarding High Frutose Corn Syrup and Atrazine", "publishedDate": "2011-12-21T18:27:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JdMQewuVkE", "description": "The EA will trade from 2 seperate MT4 brokers.

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people.\n\n\"forrest gump\",\"forrest gump clip\",\"forrest gump soundtrack\",\"forrest gump part 1\",\"tom hanks\",\"gary sinise\",\"robert zemeckis\",\"boat videos\",\"wheelchair videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",blockbusters,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",tearjerkers,\"steve starkey\",\"charles newirth\",\"steve tisch\",\"wendy finerman\",\"abandonment videos\",\"commitment videos\",\"friendship videos\",\"loyalty videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++131221,/m/0bxtg,/m/02ldv0", "title": "Forrest Gump (5/9) Movie CLIP - First Mate (1994) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-07T02:00:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JtRBAXhX1Q", "description": "The Botany Tonic - Pincer Botanical Vodka & Tonic with freshly picked Borage leaves and flowers by Ross Adamson at Ian Brown Food and Drink, Giffnock, Scotland.", "title": "Botany Tonic - Botanical Vodka & Tonic with Borage", "publishedDate": "2011-09-23T16:16:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JttMTP7gPU", "description": "Please visit www.halalgelatine2u.com for a real halal gelatine certified by JAKIM (The Department of Malaysian Islamic Development) which is being recognized by all muslim countries.", "title": "Halal Gelatine", "publishedDate": "2014-03-08T05:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JuO1e99fh0", "description": "", "title": "Arida Vortex - Welcome to Belorussian fans", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T16:44:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JuS_c8n0Io", "description": "", "title": "Pediculosis en Paraguay - Bicho nde juk\u00e1va", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T18:32:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JuTXmgVVhY", "description": "Stock Dyno with corsa pro series exhaust it made 338AWH 332TQ to the wheels.94degress outside.", "title": "2014 Jeep SRT stock!!!!AWD Mustang Dynamometer Dyno", "publishedDate": "2014-10-02T22:33:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9JuVoGfOomQ", "description": "Female Mimics, V.1, No.2, pictures professional female impersonators as they perform on stage in night clubs and prepare to do so.

The reappearance of\nSpiritual Consciousness is Within as\nDivine Feminine Christ Energy.\n\nHumankind has evolved through thousands of years of the material world\nunder a patriarchal structure.  For the Evolution of the Soul and the\nElevation of Unity Consciousness our Creativity, Intuition,\nEmotions and Heart-Centeredness are key to integrating\nwholeness.  In these times the feminine energies are\nbeing empowered and the masculine is being\nhealed to be in Harmony. Allow these\nwords to touch the shell of fear to\nheal the unhealed shame and\nblindness of power.\n\nThe Doorway is Open for you to enter and know this\nconsciousness as your own.  In the moment of\nsurrender is the Love of the Beloved I AM.\n\nThe Second Coming\nof Christ is\nWithin  \n\nThe doorway is open for you to discover the true potential of your powerful spirit. Through the voice of compassion, nurturance and harmony, transformation  takes place ushering peace, acceptance,love and cooperation.  Prepare to embrace your feminine essence and intuitive wisdom as the Divine Feminine Christ Consciousness opens your heart and imbibes your soul with a deep connection to your inner unity and mastery.\n\n\n\nThe Beloved I Am is a divinely connected co-creation where the artists, author, teachers and an international collective synchronistically unified  to compose and breathe life into the Divine Feminine Christ Consciousness. Through its unique style of artwork and wisdom the heart and mind are engaged in deep love and compassion. These compilations surround you in a radiant vibration calling you to embrace your inner truth and spiritual perfection in the timeless eternity of the heart center.\n\n\n \nThe intimacy and Sacred Love of the Divine Feminine Christ Consciousness (elevated Heart and Source connection) strikes a chord within facilitating the integration of Wholeness as you enter a state of flourishing Unconditional Love.\n\nA Collective Co-Creation of the Gold Ring\nof Enlightenment and Abundance\n\n\n\nThrough destiny, fate, luck or design synchronistic visions brought together an international cooperative of inspired people. Many coincidences and magical events surfaced during this wonderful collaboration, as the Divine Feminine Spirit behind this work expressed a will of her own and great determination to be brought forward to humanity.\n\nCompiled in the early nineties from inner communications, the Beloved I Am, Christ Within was revealed through the simple understanding of equality.  This was a time when the world was not quite ready for these activations.  And so, it sat for two decades, until a few pages were read over the internet radio. Upon hearing these words, numerous listeners felt an activation of spiritual purpose. These people came together and set out to ensure these writings were published.  Four of those working on the book witnessed a vision of a Heavenly Lady dressed in an opalescent gown, carrying an ankh surrounded by roses with honey bees in attendance.\n\nOn another timeline and pathway across the globe in Australia Lily Moses began to paint images of Spiritual Masters, Saints and Angels who appeared in her presence. Of these paintings came a message that it was being prepared for a book and the name, The Beloved I Am was given.\n\nMay each reader find the power within this material as\ntransformative and healing as we did.", "title": "The Second Coming of Christ is Within the Beloved I Am  2012", "publishedDate": "2011-12-02T20:11:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9K3I3R9j1j4", "description": "", "title": "comment tester le fusible", "publishedDate": "2012-10-15T19:24:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9K3MoxlCaJ4", "description": "Donna The Deer Lady - The Rest of the Story\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB1yEcdomt0", "title": "Deer Crossing Lady - Radio", "publishedDate": "2012-12-01T14:38:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9K3NxGxjbMY", "description": "The Caribbean is recognised as the birthplace of rum and Barbados is home to several of the leading Authentic Caribbean Rum distilleries. \n\nThe Managing Director of the West Indies Rum Distillery, Andrew Hassell, takes us on a tour through the Cockspur Distillery.

The medicine that you put into the machine comes as a liquid, which then turns into a vapor and is easy to breathe in.\n\nA mask is used for children under 6 years old. A mouthpiece is used for children 6 years and older.  \n\nKids using a nebulizer should be sitting upright to help them breathe in and out. It might help kids sit still if you can give them something to do while they receive their medicine, such as reading a book.\n\nMake sure your child keeps the mask on for the entire treatment, which can take up to 15 minutes. The nebulizer will start to sputter near the end of the treatment. Turn off the nebulizer when the chamber is empty.\n\nClean your nebulizer chamber every day. Unscrew the plastic chamber and soak in warm soapy water for 15 minutes. Run water through it, shake off water, and set out to dry.\n\nRemember if you have questions, call your doctor's office, asthma care team or pharmacy.

The heron looks for ducklings who stray from the protection of their mothers side. The heron will try to create panic among the ducklings and mallards to achieve this. To do this the heron makes repeated attacks at a safe distance from the mother. In this case the mother retreated to safety with the rest of her clutch losing one here to the heron, the mother had 9 ducklings in this years clutch and in the end managed to raise 5 of them to maturity the heron was among many that preyed on her young family. If you look closely at the point when the heron catches the duckling you will notice the other duckling diving under the water just behind the heron, it managed to escape, this time.  It will catch all kinds of Fish and Rodents including Rats but will actively hunt and attack young Birds. It will when it catches the young bird ( in this scene it is a Mallard Duckling) swallow the bird in its whole form. The Heron attacks like any other Bird of prey. The Heron can be seen attacking animals and eating birds regularly. What does the Grey Heron eat? Learn more about the Grey Heron here. The heron is one of the world's deadliest birds and the most dangerous of all predators. The Heron eats ducklings as part of its daily seasonal diet. There are thousands of ducklings born during the breeding season but most are killed and eaten by predators.

Biologist Harry Lumsden began a provincial reintroduction program in the early 1980's to re-establish the Trumpeter swan in its former habitat and range.\n\nWith prime wetland habitat, and archaeological evidence confirming the historical presence of Trumpeters in the Wye Valley, Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre became a co-operator in the restoration of this magnificent species in 1989. The original captive breeding pair of Trumpeters at Wye Marsh were \"Big Guy\" and \"Lady Girl\". Big Guy and Lady successfully raised the first cygnet in 1990, and she became known as \"Pig Pen\". In 1993, Pig Pen and her mate became the first wild nesting pair of Trumpeters in Wye Marsh in over 200 years.\n\n\n\nWhen is the best time to view Trumpeter Swans at Wye Marsh?\n\nTrumpeter swans can be found at Wye Marsh all year long, although the best time to view them in great numbers is mid-winter.\u00a0\n\nIn order to understand when to best\u00a0view the Trumpeter Swans at the Wye Marsh we must first tell you a little bit about their behaviour.\u00a0In the summer most swans are together in pairs building a nest and hatching cygnets.\u00a0Swans which\u00a0are not at breeding age are feeding and enjoying the 'single life'.\u00a0Once the the fall rolls around the swans are teaching their cygnets to fly and 'single' swans\u00a0are stocking up\u00a0on resources for a flight in a southernly direction.\u00a0Needless to say the summer and fall are not optimal times to see swans at Wye Marsh\u00a0as the families are out in the more protected areas of the marsh raising their cygnets.\u00a0There are some single swans hanging around, but things start to pick up in\u00a0the winter!.\u00a0In the winter single swans that are ready to mate pair up with perspective partners and exisiting families show off their bonds by head bobbing and honking together.\u00a0All around, winter is a social time for swans and as a result Wye Marsh can have anywhere from 6 to 60 swans enjoying the their social afternoon at the swan treatment centre.\u00a0We keep an area of water open for the swans and supplement their diet with and corn and duck pellets, essentially providing them the human equivalent of a rest stop on the highway, allowing them to stop in and fuel up, socialize and then carry on\u00a0their way.\u00a0Spring is when the pairs head off to start the cycle all over again and the 'new kids' on the block spend some time alone or in small groups discussing the woes/benefits of the 'single' life.", "title": "Trumpeter Swans greeting Swan Monitoring Volunteers at Wye Marsh", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T16:13:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KIH2FhPRs4", "description": "una breve rese\u00f1a de lo que es la logistica junto con el comercio exterior.....contactanos.", "title": "Logistica y comercio exterior", "publishedDate": "2011-07-28T16:14:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KIcJtOrHog", "description": "www.texasgunblog.com", "title": "Springfield 1911 A1 45ACP Semi Auto Milspec Pistol Review - Texas Gun Blog", "publishedDate": "2014-01-08T17:45:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KIg825b5xY", "description": "Hapa Kule News Episode 9, Power Puff Girls.

The most difficult aspect of the play is to coordinate with the rest of the aspects such as the music, the chorus, and live instruments such as the cello and ballet. \n\nThats why it took two years for the author to write the script. The result is a mixture of quotes from the Bible and from the Apostle himself with made up words, projected images, dance and music that evoke the thoughts and dramatic life of the apostle. \n\nDavid Haughton  \nIts a religious subject but it wasnt just about religion or this particular religion. Its about the human souls, what its being a person.\n\nThe eight exciting acts begin with the martyrdom of Saint Stephen; Saint Pauls conversion on the road to Damascus; preaching and miracles; the banquet of the Roman governor; the shipwreck before reaching Malta, and life in Rome.\n \nAlvise Battain\nHe travelled a lot and suffered much humiliation from those that were opposed to Christianity. They stoned him several times and miraculously survived. He had a very difficult life.\n\nDavid Haughton\nDirector \nIs hopefully to transmit these strange mixture of something very real.

Our reporter finds out how this dish is being modified.\nKerak Telor is a traditional Indonesian food that is only available in the city of Jakarta. The name is literally translated as egg crust. The dish dates back to the beginning of the 17th century when the Dutch colonized Indonesia. Kerak Telor was considered a gourmet dish because of its delicious flavor and was only available at that time to the upper classes.\n\nJakartas Kerak Telor Go International program began earlier this month. One of Indonesias best known chefs, Rudy Choirudin, demonstrates how to make the modified Kerak Telor  with a new curry-date flavor. As the name suggests, the curry-date flavor is targeted at the Middle-Eastern palate.\n\nThe method for making this new Kerak Telor is not that different from the traditional Kerak Telor. It still has the same ingredients: rice, chicken or duck eggs, dried shrimp, grated coconut and spices. The only difference is that curry seasoning is added to the Kerak Telor dough, and date pieces are spread on the dough half-way through cooking. \n\n[Fauzi Bowo, Governor of Jakarta]: \nWeve just seen a demonstration of Kerak Telor being made. Kerak Telor, which is a traditional dish from Jakarta, is now being combined with curry seasonings and pieces of dates  the taste is delicious. Some chefs will shortly be demonstrating how Kerak Telor can be made with many kinds of topping. These are new innovations and I think this project shows how Indonesian culinary culture can be developed.\n\nKerak Telor dough it is very easy to combine with different toppings, just like pizza dough. During the launch of the Kerak Telor Go International program, chefs combined the traditional dish with Western toppings such as cheese, paprika and pasta. These new flavors of Kerak Telor are demonstrated by Indonesias well known chefs, such as the chairman of Indonesia Culinary Professionals Association, Chef Vindex Tengker, Chef Tatang, and Chef Rudy.\n\nChef Rudy is proud of his countrys wealth of traditional recipes.\n\n[Rudy Choirudin, Indonesian Chef]:\nI guarantee that even if Indonesia had 100 Rudy Choirudins, our recipes will never be used up! In the last 15 years, Indonesia has had 100 cooking hosts on television. This shows that Indonesian recipes are unlimited. Our ancestors inherited many different cultures in cooking across the country.\n\nThis new type of Kerak Telor, with its wide range of toppings, will be perfected by Indonesian chefs and the flavors will be standardized before it is launched internationally.\n\nNTD News, Jakarta, Indonesia.", "title": "Kerak Telor Goes International", "publishedDate": "2009-07-29T19:21:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KPOQvXvPw4", "description": "", "title": "Bashir houres skardu", "publishedDate": "2012-02-14T10:47:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KPVryGMDu4", "description": "This is Miss Lilly, the Gould's Wattled Bat, in permanent care.

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\n\n\nSchool science & people science\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "convection of gas as smoke eater box", "publishedDate": "2011-05-06T12:57:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KYLHQTB5H4", "description": "Den nye parodisangen v\u00e5r - VENN", "title": "Guttetinget - Venn", "publishedDate": "2009-11-22T21:41:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KYMQdfarXY", "description": "Mr. G performing a psych assessment on potential star in his upcoming arena spectacular", "title": "Mr G - Psych Assessment Summer Heights High deleted scene", "publishedDate": "2009-05-12T20:10:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KYP4P3hY8I", "description": "", "title": "Torcida", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T00:44:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KYukk0Oy_8", "description": "", "title": "Flagellate", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T00:41:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KZ0Pum_eIg", "description": "79' \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u041c.\u0421.\n81' \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430 \u0413.\n\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u041c. 61' \n\u0421\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0438: \u0412\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u041c\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447, \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u0414\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\n24 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 2014 21:30 | 5-\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043d \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f-2", "title": "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432-\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f 2:1 Jevons", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T17:08:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9KZ20cdxLpM", "description": "The epilogue.\n\nMade in Flash Pro CC, a rubbish piece of software by a rubbish company.

He seems to be eating OK when I hand-feed him.\n\u00a9 vid by: http://www.youtube.com/user/mrsbirdlady\n\nLike mrsbirdlady on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mrsbirdlady/207145946089293?sk=insights\n\nThe Australian Magpie is a medium-sized black and white passerine bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea. A member of the Cracticidae, it is closely related to the butcherbirds. At one stage, the Australian Magpie was considered to be three separate species, although zones of hybridisation between forms reinforced the idea of a single species with several subspecies, nine of which are now recognised. The adult Australian Magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37 to 43 cm (14.5--17 in) in length, with distinctive black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. With its long legs, the Australian Magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground. This adaptation has led to many authorities maintaining it in its own genus Gymnorhina, however a genetic study published in 2013 has shown it to be most closely related to the Black Butcherbird rather than an early offshoot from the other butcherbirds.\nDescribed as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian Magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea.\n\nIf you find an injured or sick native animal please contact your local wildlife rescue group. These volunteers are trained to care for native species.\nAnybody can become a wildlife carer.
