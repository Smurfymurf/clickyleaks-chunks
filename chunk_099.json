It controls everything our body does, from coordinating our movements and our speech, to keeping our heart beating, to storing our memories. Despite all this there is still a lot we don't know and much of the brain's inner workings are still a mystery.\n\nThe average human brain weighs around 1.5 kg. \n\nIt is fed by a network of blood vessels that provide the brain cells with oxygen and nutrients.\n\nThe brain can be divided into four main sections - the cerebral cortex, which is split into two symmetrical cerebral hemispheres, the limbic system, the cerebellum and the brain stem. \n\nThe bulk of the brain is the symmetrical cerebral cortex. Each cerebral hemisphere is separated into four main lobes, which have different functions. The frontal lobe is responsible for decision-making, problem solving and planning. The parietal lobe receives and processes all the sensory information from the body. The temporal lobe is responsible for memory, emotion, hearing and language. The occipital lobe controls vision.\n\nAt the centre of the brain is the limbic system. This area controls a number of functions, but importantly controls learning and memory, particularly in the hippocampus.\n\nThe cerebellum or little brain, controls movement, posture and balance.\n\nThe brain stem, which is thought to be the oldest part of the brain, controls basic life functions like heart beat, breathing and blood pressure.\"\n\n\nPlease watch our other videos to see how brain cells function, hear what dementia is, and to hear more about Alzheimer's disease, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia and other rarer causes of dementia. \n\nAlzheimer's Society is dedicated to defeating dementia through research.

It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's Sea Cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century. It is also the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of at least 37 countries throughout the Indo-Pacific,[3] though the majority of dugongs live in the northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay.[4] The dugong is the only strictly-marine herbivorous mammal, as all species of manatee utilize fresh water to some degree.[3]\nLike all modern sirenians, the dugong has a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hindlimbs, instead possessing paddle-like forelimbs used to maneuver itself. It is easily distinguished from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail, but also possesses a unique skull and teeth.[5] The dugong is heavily dependent on seagrasses for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats where they grow, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas such as bays, mangrove channels and the lee sides of large inshore islands.[3] Its snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for grazing and uprooting benthic seagrasses.\n\nInfo Taken from Wikipedia.com\nCredits to wikipedia.com\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong", "title": "Dugong in Thailand by Asiatravel.com", "publishedDate": "2009-07-21T09:55:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Dw95aipT_4", "description": "Busted with BIG ass Joint at a 420 Celebration.\nCNN News Clip.", "title": "4 Foot 2 Pound Joint 0 people got to Smoke it", "publishedDate": "2013-04-24T17:33:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5DwUWpNRHrc", "description": "Dopo lo stupore dell'inaspettata pesca (pensavo che era un bel rombo chiodato di 5 kg...)\u00e8 arrivato il momento di issare la pastinaca a bordo e slamarla.", "title": "Pescata pastinaca o brucco con la coffa.", "publishedDate": "2013-09-28T07:32:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Dwf2PQxSyI", "description": "MicroCT scan of a marine isopod (Crustacean).

The teenager faints frequently due to bizarre illness called Postural Tachycardia Syndrome, or PoTS. \n\nBartram has suffered from Postural Tachycardia Syndrome for five years but was only properly diagnosed last November at the age of 16. The illness causes her nervous system to respond abnormally when she stands up. She faints if she stands up for more than 30 minutes.\n\nBartram has had some serious accidents in the past. She was once left lying on the street for about half an hour in winter because passers-by assumed she was drunk. Another time she fainted and fell all the way down a flight of stairs and fractured her neck.\n\nShe has now learned to manage her condition. Sometimes she will sit down for a few minutes if she thinks she's going to faint. \n\nPostural Tachycardia Syndrome causes dizziness and fainting.

I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it,\" he added, Snowden compares the clandestine surveillance techniques revealed in National Security Agency (NSA) documents he leaked six months ago to Orwell's signature book.\nThe novel, first published in 1949, portrays a dystopian future in which an authoritarian regime keeps track of the population through the omniscient Big Brother character.\n\"Great Britain's George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information,\" Snowden said. \"The types of collection in the book -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today.\n\"We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person.\"A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves an unrecorded, unanalysed thought.

Ben Skinner has cut through the superficial gloss to reveal an alternative photographic vision from deep within his northern-suburbs abode. His sense of composition borders on psychotic, yet it also conveys a kinship with the subjects he portrays.\n \nSkinner's work exemplifies a reaction to prevailing trends and ideas. From images of single figures in austere environments through to large casts in elaborate settings, he has a multifarious archive that leaves a marked impression. His acute awareness of theatricality elevates the ordinary person \nto a level of perfection rarely seen in South African photography today.\n \nRhetorical Self offers no anaesthetic to dull the viewer's sensibility. The operation awaits -- surgery undertaken by women who normally frequent the local bistros. His fascination with the human form finds expression through capturing real people with compelling features, emphasising their raw nature rather than representing a predictable aesthetic. His ability to create habitats that expose these traits is his greatest asset.  \n \nSkinner has developed a style that is provocative and disturbing, mercurial and curious, often darkly humorous and utterly distinctive.

Australian gamers have already demonstrated a keenness to help promote and change the popular media discourse on games and play away from media effects of violence and addiction and towards positive social contributions. The rapid change to Australian content regulation laws to include the R18 classification for games in Australia between 2009 and 2012 was, in part, due to the success of Australian gamers' broad community support and appeal. \n\nThanks to the most recent research we know that Australian gamers spend more than $AU2.5 billion on games annually and that women are rapidly catching up to men as avid gamers, but we don't yet have an understanding of what play ultimately means to us and what it is that we produce when we play. This project proposes to identify what Australian do when they play, what it is they build and share, how they express themselves creatively through play and whether such cultural products are of significant economic, social and historical value. The research will address claims of the unproductiveness of play, and its purpose is to consider what is actually being produced during play and the motivations behind it.", "title": "Products of Play: Caching in on Australian Gamers", "publishedDate": "2013-05-07T01:11:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EVTER5pZRc", "description": "AJ K", "title": "A Bushel and a Peck, With Lyrics, sung by toddlers", "publishedDate": "2012-02-17T04:57:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EVpkSQnO4Y", "description": "People's Voice...Mrs.Tanvi Parikh from Charniroad working in the field of Trading, sharing her personal experience as a Parent about DMIT (Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test) done through Brainseed Education Pvt Ltd Counselling done by Mr. Shashidhar G Iyer, Mumbai,\nwww.brainseed.in\n09029111374\n09222212061\n09819911374", "title": "DMIT-BRAINSEED-People's Voice", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T14:12:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EWivbJsh6g", "description": "416-962-2623 / 1-866-760-2623\nhttp://www.immigroup.com/ \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/backgrounders/2012/2012-06-20b.asp\n\n\nQ: How will the FRFC Act effect inadmissibility due to misrepresentation?\n\nA: Under the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act, the inadmissibility period imposed on individuals who were misrepresenting themselves will be changed from two years to five, and an additional ban on applying for permanent residency will also be imposed. \n\nRe Quality and Feedback email info@immigroup.com (Please reference Research and Development)\n\nDid you catch a mistake? \nAre you looking for answers we don't have?

He said Pakistani fire was to provide cover for Pakistan-based militants to cross into Indian-held territory.\n\nThe head of the Pakistani forces patrolling the frontier, Maj-Gen Khan Javed Khan, told the BBC that the Indian attacks were the most intense in decades.\n\n\"I just want to know the reason from the other side. We are not finding the answer,\" he said. \"But if they continue to fire, they will continue to see a major response from us.\"\n\nThe latest round of hostilities comes just months after India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration.\n\nBut relations have deteriorated since then.\n\nIn August, India cancelled talks with Pakistan after accusing it of interfering in its internal affairs.\n\nAnd last month, Mr Modi, in his first speech at the UN, said he wanted peace talks with Pakistan but insisted it must create an \"appropriate atmosphere\".\n\n\nExtra Tag-\nnewsbuzz news \"daily news\" \"todays news\" \"celebrity news\" \"latest news\" \"viral news\" \"best news\" \"breaking news\",ccna,viral news,war,india - pakistan war,kashmir war,ind vs pak,pak vs ind,india war,pakistan war", "title": "Kashmir: India and Pakistan warn each other over attacks", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T14:04:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EdgkQPKLIU", "description": "This set contains:\n(16) Eyeshadows:\n-Underland (Flash)\n-Alice (Painkiller)\n-Oraculum (Baked)\n-Queen (Last Call)\n-Chessur (Chopper)\n-White Rabbit (Polyester Bride)\n-Wonderland (Maui Wowie)\n-Curiouser (Grifter)\n-Muchness (X)\n-Mushroom (Mushroom)\n-Midnight Tea Party (Midnight Cowboy Rides Again)\n-Vorpal (S&M)\n-Absolem (Homegrown)\n-Drink Me Eat Me (Sin)\n-Mad Hatter (Twice Baked)\n-Jabberwocky (Oil Slick)\n-Travel-size 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in Zero and Flipside\n-Eyeshadow Primer Potion", "title": "Urban Decay Alice in Wonderland Eyeshadow Palette", "publishedDate": "2010-02-02T01:57:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EdlLjARg1g", "description": "Chad McCallon performing Defying Gravity from the Broadway Musical Wicked. \n\nHey guys...

Published in Nature 505, 382\u2013385 (16 January 2014) doi:10.1038/nature12806. \n\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7483/full/nature12806.html\n\nAbstract: Adhesives are made of polymers1 because, unlike other materials, polymers ensure good contact between surfaces by covering asperities, and retard the fracture of adhesive joints by dissipating energy under stress2, 3. But using polymers to \u2018glue\u2019 together polymer gels is difficult, requiring chemical reactions, heating, pH changes, ultraviolet irradiation or an electric field4, 5, 6, 7. Here we show that strong, rapid adhesion between two hydrogels can be achieved at room temperature by spreading a droplet of a nanoparticle solution on one gel\u2019s surface and then bringing the other gel into contact with it. The method relies on the nanoparticles\u2019 ability to adsorb onto polymer gels and to act as connectors between polymer chains, and on the ability of polymer chains to reorganize and dissipate energy under stress when adsorbed onto nanoparticles. We demonstrate this approach by pressing together pieces of hydrogels, for approximately 30 seconds, that have the same or different chemical properties or rigidities, using various solutions of silica nanoparticles, to achieve a strong bond. Furthermore, we show that carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals that do not bond hydrogels together become adhesive when their surface chemistry is modified. To illustrate the promise of the method for biological tissues, we also glued together two cut pieces of calf\u2019s liver using a solution of silica nanoparticles. As a rapid, simple and efficient way to assemble gels or tissues, this method is desirable for many emerging technological and medical applications such as microfluidics, actuation, tissue engineering and surgery.", "title": "Nanoparticle solutions as adhesives for gels and biological tissues", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T07:43:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5EoCFd-Dv_c", "description": "A new recommendation from experts suggests women need fewer pap smears.

A fair consumption of this bitters on a weekly basis will help to prevent colds, flu, headaches, jaundice, and bellyaches, used medicinally, and as a vegetable. Cerasee made of the vine is used for diabetes, hypertension, worms, dysentery and as a general tonic and blood purifier and is thought to relieve constipation and colds and fevers in children. In the southern parts of Mozambique the cerasee leaves are taken as an anti-inflammatory remedy and particular sought for urinary tract inflammations. The cerasee form is used for diabetes, digestive disorders, fevers and ulcers. Cerasee is especially sought after as a detoxifier.\n\nCerasee is rich in vitamins A & C, carotene, calcium, iron, phosphorous and alkaloids.  Cerasee is taken to cleanse the body of harmful toxins and patients have reported increasing energy, vitality and stamina. Because cerasee is natural, the vitamins and minerals contained are easily absorbed by the digestive system thereby allowing for greater absorption and efficacy.\nCerasee is recommended as a natural tonic for suffers of ulcers (stomach and duodenum), bile and digestive disorders. Momordica passed three out of five pathogen tests and is considered as a natural antibiotic. Consumers also show an increase in the strength of their nails and hair.\n\nGINGER\nHealth Benefits:\nHistorically, ginger has a long tradition of patient reporting in alleviating symptoms of gastrointestinal distress. In herbal medicine, ginger is regarded as an excellent carminative (a substance which promotes the elimination of intestinal gas) and intestinal spasmolytic (a substance which relaxes and soothes the intestinal tract). Modern scientific research has revealed that ginger possesses numerous therapeutic properties including antioxidant effects, an ability to inhibit the formation of inflammatory compounds, and direct anti-inflammatory effects.", "title": "Cerasee & Ginger Drink", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T22:10:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ErS0QZTOLc", "description": "This is a cheap hand grip I made for my small HD camera.

The race had been predicted to be a three-way battle between Murray Halbert, the defending 5000m champion, the defending 10,000m champion Pyotr Bolotnikov, and the world record holder Ron Clarke. It did not go according to plan.\n\nBy the halfway mark, though, only Clarke was anywhere near the front, accompanied by Tunisian Mohamed Gammoudi and the American Billy Mills.\n\nMills was so unheralded that, in the run-up to the Games, not one reporter had asked him a single question. They should have done, for his story was memorable.\n\nHe had been born in South Dakota as a member of a Native American family, and was raised on a reservation reserved for the Oglala Sioux people. He had 11 brothers and sisters, but was orphaned at the age of 12, and so was raised by his grandmother.\n\nHe took up boxing and used to run as a way of staying fit, but discovered he was a better runner than boxer, and so won a place at the University of Kansas on an athletic scholarship.\nHe excelled at cross-country while at university but, by the time of the Olympic Games, he had left Kansas to join the US Marine Corps. It was while serving in the armed forces that he qualified for the Games.\n\nHis qualifying time was not notable, but he had spent years planning for the final and had belief that, on the day, he would match the standard of those around him.\n\nThe race was more about endurance, tactics and even fortune than out-and-out pace. The last lap was a confusing affair, with slower runners being lapped as Clarke, Gammoudi and Mills charged along, elbowing and shoving each other as they jockeyed for position. Clarke led, then Gammoudi and then, to the astonishment of both the frontrunners, Mills sprinted past to win by almost three metres, beating his own personal best time by 47 seconds.\n\n\"I'm flabbergasted,\" said Mills in victory. Famously, a Japanese reporter asked simply \"who are you?\"\n\nVictory changed his life. He was acclaimed by his tribe as a warrior and given the name Makoce Teh'la, which translates as \"loves his country\". He has devoted much of his life to working with Native American communities and remains the first and, so far, only American to win Olympic 10,000m gold.\n\nFind more about the Tokyo 1964 Olympic Games: http://www.olympic.org/tokyo-1964-summer-olympics", "title": "Incredible Moment As Underdog Billy Mills Wins 10,000m Gold - Tokyo 1964 Olympics", "publishedDate": "2013-06-11T15:08:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5F61EnMiDD8", "description": "", "title": "SOLO DOYRA NTNEL GAVRELOV", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T23:43:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5F6kqZ4zSEM", "description": "Hi helped my friend painting his MPX TwinStar 2.

DMC Champs | Craze & Klever  | DJ Play Off | Traktor Scratch | A 5th & Ocean Production | DJ Craze was born in Managua, Nicaragua. At the age of 3, in 1980, he fled the country with his family during the war which lasted throughout the 1980s. Craze and his family moved to San Francisco, California, where they lived for a short while, before moving to Miami, Florida, where he currently resides.\n\nThe style of his music carries many of his past musical influences. Initially influenced by the Miami Bass movement when he was younger, Craze has gone on to incorporate elements of hip-hop, drum n bass, and breaks in his turntable routines. Recently, Craze has shifted his emphasis to DJ'ing and producing drum n bass with his own record label \"Cartel\". Craze released his first album in 1999, Crazee Musick, and a second in 2002, Scratch nerds. He also released an album called D-Day in 2002 with his turntable crew, The Allies.\n\nCraze has released two of the most popular battle records ever, \"Bully Breaks\" and \"Bully Breaks 2\". Craze was Kanye West's DJ for his Glow in the Dark tour in 2008 while A-Trak worked on his Fool's Gold record label and tour. Craze was featured on the Native-Instruments website demonstrating the Traktor X1 Controller.\n\nRecently, Craze created his own record label with fellow DJ & friend Kill The Noise, Slow Roast Records. Slow Roast is distributed by Fool's Gold, the record label shared by A-Trak and Nick Catchdubs. Other than Craze and Kill The Noise, Klever and Senor Stereo also release material under the Slow Roast label.\n\nIn February 2011 DJ Craze and DJ Shiftee worked together, spinning on-stage with controllerist and Traktor S4 consultant Ean Golden at Club EVE in downtown Miami for the Midi Fight Club event. Between the two of them, DJ Craze and DJ Shiftee had 7 DMC world championships behind them. The event highlighted the use of Native Instruments controllers, such as the X1, S4 and Maschine.\n\nIn September 2011, DJ Craze became Yelawolf's DJ, and signed a deal to his label Slumerican Records. He was featured on Yelawolf \"Hard White Tour\", along with Rittz.\nWhen it comes to matching the latest technology with world-class turntablism skills to produce next-level routines, Miami's DJ Craze is the ultimate choice.\n\nIn this video, the 5x DMC World Champion showcases the power of the new Traktor Scratch generation by creating a live dubstep remix, controlled by his golden Technics turntables and two controllers.\n\nKontrol X1 is used to play a live beat using one-shot drum samples in Traktor's new Sample Decks, while Craze also triggers various other samples and cue points with his custom white Maschine controller. A beat juggling section in the middle leads to the finale where Craze combines fast cue-point juggles and vocal samples with the integrated Traktor effects.\n\nAll things combined, this latest Turntable Tricknology routine effectively highlights the vastly expanded creative potential of the new Traktor generation.

Iata de ce tehnologia UHD Dimming de la Samsung a fost dezvoltata, pentru procesarea tonurilor de negru si alb cu cel mai inalt grad de optimizare posibil, producand culori cu mult mai vii. \u00a0 De 4 ori mai mare decat rezolutia Full HD Vizionarea Ultra HD inseamna ca puteti vedea chiar si cele mai mici detalii de pe ecran mai clar ca niciodata. Televizorul dvs. Samsung UHD ofera o rezolutie de patru ori mai mare decat Full HD, cu culori exacte si realiste. Bucurati-va de o imagine optimizata pentru o claritate si mai mare si detalii deosebite. \u00a0 Clear Motion Rate minimizeaza neclaritatea cauzata de miscare Datorita tehnologiei avansate Clear Motion Rate (CMR) de la Samsung, pana si scenele cu miscare rapida sunt transmise cu claritate. O rata CMR mai ridicata inseamna o imagine mai exacta, cu mai putine neclaritati cauzate de miscare, pentru ca dvs. sa va puteti bucura cat mai mult de filme de actiune, emisiuni de sport si alte genuri de divertisment. Aceasta tehnologie este posibila datorita ratei de reimprospatare imbunatatite a panoului, vitezei procesorului de imagine si tehnologiei de iluminare de fundal. Ceea ce insemna o vizionare cu mult superioara. \u00a0 Future Ready Tehnologia televizoarelor evolueaza in permanenta, iar televizoarele Samsung UHD sunt in pas cu progresul. Cu kitul UHD Evolution*, televizorul dvs. Samsung UHD poate fi actualizat pentru a fi compatibil cu viitoarele standarde UHD, fara a necesita achizitionarea unui nou televizor. Fiti pregatit pentru viitoarele standarde UHD cu tehnologia Future Ready*. * Kitul UHD Evolution se vinde separat. * Aceasta functie este bazata pe conectivitatea UHD, standardele de difuzare si initiativele de standardizare Blu-ray. \u00a0 O imagine captivanta care pare sa pluteasca in aer Datorita designului Aero Design de la Samsung, va puteti bucura de o vizualizare mai captivanta si mai placuta ca niciodata. Suportul Aero inalta imaginea, facand-o parca sa pluteasca si aducand divertismentul in centrul atentiei. Materialele naturale si detaliile premium contribuie la aspectul elegant cu care va veti mandri, iar difuzorul incorporat, discret, ofera un sunet excelent direct de la televizor. \u00a0 Multitasking remarcabil cu Multi-Link Screen (Dual) Functia Multi-Link Screen de la Samsung duce experienta divertismentului la un nou nivel, oferind vizualizarea mai multor ecrane.

We throw everything in the garbage. Landfills are reaching maximum capacity yet we continue to generate more waste. In the early 1970's archaeologist Dr. William Rathje examined landfill content to determine what Americans were throwing away and found paper was the most abundant component of modern landfills. Forty years later more plastic than paper is entering landfills. A recent study in California estimated that over 1 billion plastic bottles end up in landfills each year -- that's more than 3 million bottles per day. Managing plastic waste is a global problem. Thus as we are depleting our natural resources and stuffing landfills to capacity we are creating an environmental, ecological, and economic dilemma that can only be solved through engineering.\n\nThe SOLUTION:  If these plastic bottles were recycled they could be converted into more than 74 million square ft of carpet, 74 million extra large T-shirts, or 16 million sweatshirts just to name a few. These are just a few sustainable solutions to this issue. Through Garbology and materials science engineering students explored the role and recycle potential of polymers in reaching a goal of zero landfill.

This is the wood at the center of a tree trunk or branch that is older, darker, and harder than the wood surrounding it. Because of a naturally occurring chemical transformation, this wood has become more resistant to decay. The term heartwood derives solely from its position at the center of a tree.  \n\nJust as Chelsea is a culinary, cultural, and artistic center of Manhattan, so Heartwood is a center of Chelsea.  Heartwood seeks to become a premier go-to Chelsea destination for its signature wood-roasted meats and fish, wood-fired pizza, and what's sure to be an award-winning specialty cocktail list.  The Bar at Heartwood will be the epicenter of Chelsea's nightlife scene, catering to Chelsea's ethically, culturally, and socially diverse population.  Heartwood promises to become everyone's favorite meeting place, the new heart of the neighborhood.\nExecutive Chef Bradford Thompson and his team offer a tantalizing selection of wood-roasted meats and fish, as well as his signature wood-fired pizzas.  Chef Thompson cooks from the heart with a memorable blend of bold flavors and elegant refinement.  The cooking is intensely seasonal, with vegetable and light stocks playing starring roles.  Heartwood's menu changes frequently to maximize utilization of in-season produce grown by local farmers.  The restaurant actively uses the Union Square Greenmarket as a product source throughout the year.\nHeartwood's beverage program is designed to offer the best selection of drinks in town.  Our coffee, beer, wine and spirits selection must be considered the best chosen, most innovatively presented and most outstanding value available in New York.  We aim to offer \"hand-crafted\" products that are not available on every cookie-cutter list, and that will encourage our guests to return to Heartwood for more.

Known as \"Human Modernism\", Alvar Aalto's dialogue with nature, architecture, design, and the human being has become a living legacy.\n\nThe exhibition features many rare and important pieces, such as chairs from the Rautatalo Caf\u00e9 in Helsinki produced in the 1950\u00b4s, and an early example of the \"Paimio Chair\" - which shares the same name of the Sanatorium that was completed in 1932.\n\nAlso featured in the exhibition are several original Savoy Vases, which were named after the Savoy Restaurant in Helsinki, for which Aalto and his wife Aino Aalto designed the entire furnishings and light fixtures.  The Savoy Vase design won the 1936 competition organized by Finland's glass manufactures - Karhula and Iittala - and was also featured at the Paris World's Fair a year later in 1937.

The liver secrets enzymes critical in the breakdown of alcohol.\n\nOne of these enzymes is Aldehyde Dehydrogenase. Persons with alcohol intolerance either don't secret enough of these enzymes or these Asian Flush enzymes secreted by the liver are largely inactive. If these critical enzymes are not present in quantities and/or qualities necessary the end result is higher than acceptable alcohol related toxins in the body of the alcohol consumer.\n\nIt is these toxins that produce all of the symptoms of allergy to alcohol as well as the elevated Asian Glow cancer risks.\n\nFortunately alcohol intolerance is treatable using an Asian Flush treatment of some sort. An Asian Flush treatment will assist the liver in the production of these enzymes. Higher levels of these enzymes will successfully neutralize the toxins. Less toxins means no more Asian Flush symptoms and Asian Flush esophageal cancer risks minimized.\n\nAlcohol intolerance in no way is an indication the health of the drinkers liver has been compromised as Asian Flush is normally a genetic defect. The only exception to this are persons who experience sudden alcohol intolerance.\n\nSudden alcohol intolerance does most likely mean the livers health has been compromised either through chronic alcohol abuse or perhaps illness or virus of some sort.\n\nIf you have always suffered allergic reactions to alcohol then your condition is genetic and not sudden alcohol intolerance.", "title": "Alcohol Intolance Liver alcohol intolerance and your liver", "publishedDate": "2012-09-03T06:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5GP9BZlU_h8", "description": "", "title": "bursztynowy blask -

tried to establish what their precise impact on cardiovascular fitness.\nThe people involved in the study consumed on average 67 grams of nuts a day for a period of three to eight weeks.\nBesides improving levels of cholesterol, nuts reduced the amount of triglycerides, another type of blood fat that has also been linked to heart disease.\nHowever, scientists say, the impact was less pronounced among overweight participants.\nSterols\nScientists do not know why nuts have this effect, but believe it could be because they contain phytosterols, compounds that are thought-block-cholesterol absorption in the intestine.\nAs stated by Professor Joan Sabat\u00e9, who led the study, \"the effects of nut consumption are related to the dose ingested, and the different types of nuts have similar effects.\"\nBut the scientist adds that these effects were \"significantly modified by LDL cholesterol (the so-called\" bad cholesterol \") and present, body mass index and type of diet.\"\nIn other words, the researcher explains the effect of nut consumption on cholesterol levels was greater among individuals with high levels of \"bad cholesterol\", with a low body mass index and among those eating Western-type diets .\n\"Nuts are a whole food has been consumed by humans throughout history,\" says the scientist.\n\"And it can be expected that increasing nut consumption as part of a prudent diet favorably affects lipid levels in the blood and has the potential to reduce heart disease risk,\" he adds.\nOther experts warn, however, caution should be used with the consumption of sugar-coated nuts and salt.", "title": "Nut consumption and reducing triglycerides colecterol", "publishedDate": "2012-06-30T12:22:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5GPisCwzJos", "description": "THC : https://www.facebook.com/THC420Simou\nDomas : https://www.facebook.com/domas.mogmuzika\nFB : https://www.facebook.com/LietuvishkasRepas\n\nTu, tu, tu dar ne\u012fkerti\nKas mane privert\u0117 kv\u0117puoti \u012fvykiais\nTik\u0117ti cinikais, o k\u0105 pasi\u016blytum man?\nNebent tik pasigydyti\nDavai parodyk, kur pabaiga \u0161ito koridoriaus\nTik u\u017esimerk, ten pat atsiduriu\nKuriu lyg triler\u012f, kai pakei\u010dia milimetrai\nKai mylios tirpstai tyliai, tyliai\nA, vienam akligatvyje\nAklai gali pasiekti, \u010di\u016bju nu bent jau vidur\u012f\nPaklausk ar a\u0161 \u010dia buv\u0119s, blet, nu lyg ir\nPalygink norus, galimyb\u0119s, choru r\u0117ksim\nJei pavyko gal a\u0161 psychas\nBet kei\u010dia laikas, o ne pychas\nKei\u010dia sm\u016bgiai \u012f padycha, gabalai netap\u0119 hitais\nKei\u010dia skai\u010diai, tad po mano parto tycha\nNor\u0117\u010diau visko u\u017e dyk\u0105, ir am\u017einai b\u016bti gyvu\nNor\u0117\u010diau jog surastum mane, net jei b\u016bsiu numir\u0119s\nIr dar nor\u0117\u010diau, jog nesibaigt\u0173 man natos\nIr jeigu visk\u0105 nachui, kad bent virp\u0117t\u0173 grudakas.\n\nIr niekur nieko pana\u0161aus \u012f \u0161\u012f pasaul\u012f\nIr tebunie man skirta, apeit basam j\u012f\nAkim pas\u0105monei, per sprindi geresniu nei vakar\n\u017dinai kai bus sunku, k\u0105, gali paskambint.

Statistics reveal that 26,000 cars pass over the bridge each day.  The Longfellow Bridge connects Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood to Cambridge's Kendall Square.\n\nIn addition to the automobile traffic, 90,000 commuters ride the Red Line over the Longfellow Bridge on a daily basis.\n\nLongfellow Bridge is now undergoing a renovation.  I captured some of the construction activity when I walked over the bridge.  As of this filming, half of the bridge is closed to pedestrian traffic.  \n\nAlthough there is some rust, peeling paint, and crumbling concrete, it's clear that the Longfellow Bridge has solid bones.

Songs can light fires.  Songs can give hope.  Songs tell a story. The story we\u2019ve been telling with our songs starts with Over and Underneath.  Christ is Over and Underneath us, Higher than the heights of our purity, lower than the depths of our depravity. He is above us He went below us bringing down the proud, lifting up the broken and when you get that in you it doesn\u2019t make you a good person first, it makes you an honest person.\n \nThe Light Meets the Dark and the masks come off the \u201cHealing Begins\u201d we\u2019re more than the sum of our mistakes  we\u2019re the sum of the Father\u2019s love for us we don\u2019t have to save ourselves He was \u201cStrong Enough to Save\u201d us. Then we\u2019re freed up to be honest about our struggles.\n \nWe can admit that forgiveness feels like \u201cLosing,\u201d we feel \u201cWorn,\u201d we need redemption, but hallelujah we\u2019re not struggling to be free. Hallelujah we don\u2019t have to struggle alone. Philippians 1:30 says we are in this struggle together.\n \nJohn Dunn said it this way, \u201cNo Man is an Island.\u201d  None of us are meant to carry our burdens alone. So as our song story continues we\u2019re hoping to remind you that you can get off your islands of isolation. Our prayer is that this next group of songs might help lift the shame that\u2019s led you there, that it might break the chains that kept you there, and that you\u2019re able to get in the boat of community and sail by the Stars of God\u2019s promises until you reach the shore for we are His Cathedrals.", "title": "Tenth Avenue North - We Are Cathedrals", "publishedDate": "2014-09-10T09:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5GfG8SiEsJg", "description": "\u25baInfo & Cheap Booking! : http://www.hotelz.tv/info/italy/bergamo/eFHHCbfIeF/bombyx-inn.html\n\u25baBest Hotels in Bergamo : http://www.hotelz.tv/search/Italy/bergamo/1.html\n\nBombyx Inn is set in Bergamos trade fair area only 3 km from both Bergamo Train Station and Orio al Serio Airport.

Medical miracles are a common occurrence when using oil derived from this specific medicinal plant\"\n\n    Rick Simpson marks 8 years of his miraculous discovery, disclosure and spread of information concerning the miraculous cure in the form of oil that is obtained from hemp plant \u2014 oil that cures almost all serious diseases like cancer, lymphoma, sarcoma, leukemia, Crohn's disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, ulcers , burns, psoriasis, AIDS, diabetes, depression, hemorrhoids, blood and eye pressure, regulation of body weight, chronic pain, migraine, mutated cells (polyps, warts, tumors), insomnia, scars ...\n\n    Having cured himself of metastatic skin cancer 8 years ago, and subsequently many others from all over the spectrum of various serious and incurable illnesses, Rick has devoted his time to further research the oil, expanding public awareness and seeking the truth ...\n\n    He wanted to share his invention with the rest of the world, however, was met with incredible resistance and lack of understanding by the authorities responsible for advocating for the welfare of people. These are various organs such as the pharmaceutical companies, government agencies for health, and UN offices.\n\n    Since then, Rick tries to reach as many people around the world via the Internet, various radio and television interviews and newspaper articles, so that people know their options and find out what is really happening \u2014 why is that medicine not available to everyone?\n\n    Also, Rick has held well-attended events throughout Europe, that is, in his words: \"The best mean of informing the public, the place where I can directly reach the people.\" Rick continues his beneficial mission of informing the public and so ...\n\n    ... For the first time in Croatia Rick Simpson is presenting in a three-hour event (seminar and discussion) information and knowledge gained from his 8 years of research and experience, under the organizer \u2014 the Spirit association from Rijeka.\n\n    After the Rick Simpson speech, the perception of health care and treatments that it offers, will be forever changed, and for the greatest skeptics, at least a bit, just to start looking the other side. In addition, you'll be able to hear and find out direct from the cureall inventor, everything about the cure and its miraculous effects without any sideffects \u2014 a cure that cures almost all serious illness within 3 months. You'll find out why is this cure not available in circulation around pharmacies, you'll find out about cure history and treatments, how is it used today and what can be done. Also, you'll find out about the use of hemp in a variety of industrial purposes, and many other important information ... information that is fascinating in every respect. What is most important, for about an hour you will have the opportunity to personally ask what interests you about the information that you will hear on the speech!\n\n    This event takes the motto: \"Knowledge for all people\" and the aim is to broaden horizons and awaken attitudes, to encourage more people to think carefully about the drugs they are using daily, drug effects and health care in general. Based on the extremely important information that you will find out on the event, and your future personal research on the topic, you will maybe stop blindly accept what we call \"law \" of health care institutions, and then we can work together to change it...\n\nhttp://www.phoenixtears.ca\nhttp://phoenixtears.ca/hemp-oil/video-library/", "title": "1800 GALLONS of Ethanol PER ACRE", "publishedDate": "2011-07-05T15:08:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5GyhFsJoiYc", "description": "I was a baby river otter's mom for a few months this past year at a wildlife rehabilitation center.

They're nice and firm and ready to be filled. I'm going to go on ahead and with a piping bag. You can choose any filling you like, whether it's store-bought or caramel.\n\nI'm using Nutella. You can make your own ganache and fill it up. I'm going to take my piping bag and fill up my molds until they are three-quarters of the way full. So as I am filling the mold, you can see I'm holding my piping bag really firm. And at the end, I don't want to lift up and have a big Hershey kiss shape to it.\n\nSo I'm giving my wrist a little bit of a twist and that almost acts like a little palette knife. I'm keeping my piping bag from creating that Hershey kiss shape as best as I can. The reason we don't want to overfill these molds is because we'll be topping them off with another layer of dark chocolate. So this way it's fully encased.\n\nIf I were to try and overfill, I would have kind of big domes of chocolate. You don't want to under fill, either, because that way you would have a really thick, crunchy layer of chocolate on the bottom of your truffle. So, just about three-quarters of the way.\n\nWe're ready to go. So I'm going to give it a little bit of a tap on the table. This will help smooth out any extra little nipply things kind of sticking up. Just a little bit more of my tempered dark chocolate right over the top.\n\nSo, I've drizzled in my dark chocolate. I'm going to hit it a little bit and with my offset spatula, just smooth it over the tops. That is going to cover up my filling. Make sure you fill them all the way. If you need to add any extra chocolate, this is a good time to do it.\n\nOK. Now, with a bench scraper, kind of scrape off any excess. So, that is it. All I have left are my little heart shapes. I'm going to pop this back into the fridge for about 10 minutes, let it firm up, and pop these chocolates out of the mold.\n\nSo, my chocolate truffles have been in the fridge for about five or 10 minutes until, you can see, they are nice and firm. All I'm going to do is kind of move back and forth on the mold and loosen things up a little bit. Then we pray.\n\nAnd then we flip them over and hope they all come out, which they did. These are beautiful. You can see how kind of shiny and glossy they are.\n\nIf any don't come out, just give it a little extra hit. Or, if you really have trouble, pop it back into the fridge for another couple of minutes and they should release on their own. There we go.\n\nThey are all out. That's it! You can see, how many we made just by using one mold. You can like, have enough for an entire dinner party. So, if you want to, you can put them in these really cute candy cups or you can serve them just as they are. Give them as gifts, put them in a box. They are really delicious, really cute.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Carjam   New BMW M5 Official Promo F10 First glimpse 2011 2012", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:13:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HSLyfjZ3gE", "description": "A quick demo on how the optimized hot-desk feature of the Sun Ray technology can increase productivity and ease of use.", "title": "Oracle Sun Ray Technology", "publishedDate": "2010-10-28T15:30:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HSUx7CRsDI", "description": "stills from Lepakkomies gig, music unfortunately is not.", "title": "Hexdrive: Charnel House", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T19:38:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HSbMX6XTAo", "description": "A look into the origins of the National Audubon Society, from its inception in 1886 to its work today as well as Rachel Carson's work to ban the use of DDT, a harmful pesticide.", "title": "A Short History of the National Audubon Society", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T14:46:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HSgTO8WXn0", "description": "Teej Dance & Song - in Kobang Mustang 2011\nDhaulagiri Club -Lete Jomsom Tukche Taglung Ghasa", "title": "Teej Dance & Song - in Kobang Mustang Dhaulagiri Club Nepal", "publishedDate": "2012-04-12T20:49:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5HSxfy8iqEI", "description": "El escenario en esta ocasi\u00f3n se encuentra en Rusia, m\u00e1s concretamente en la pen\u00ednsula de Kamchatka, tierras todav\u00eda casi v\u00edrgenes y salvajes, donde el mejor alojamiento es en una humilde yurta.

Scavelli, Adam Siegel, Ronaldo Vasconcellos, Edgar Wright\nScreenwriter: Michael Bacall, Edgar Wright, Bryan Lee O'Malley\nFilm Description: Based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's Oni Press comic book of the same name, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World follows the eponymous slacker rocker on his colorful quest to defeat his dream girl's seven evil ex-boyfriends. Twenty-two-year-old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) may not have a job, but rocking the bass for his band, Sex Bob-omb, is a tough job unto itself. When Scott locks eyes with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he knows she's the girl he wants to grow old with. But Ramona has some serious baggage; her supercharged exes rue the thought of her being with another man, and they'll crush any guy who gives her a second glance. Now, in order to win Ramona's heart, Scott will do battle with everyone from vegan-powered rock gods to sinister skateboarders, never losing sight of his gorgeous goal as he pummels his way to victory.

The fragrance of Labdanum is very complex. This waxy resin produces a balsamlike, woody, earthy, marshy, smoky, ambergrislike, leathery, flowery, honeylike, mintlike fragrance with hints of plum or oakmoss after a rain.\n\nLabdanum has fascinated people for many centuries. It is said to reach deep into our subconscious and bring back memories, pictures, feelings and moods.\n\nLabdanum originates from the rockrose bush, which emits a resinous dark brown mass from its leaves and twigs. To this day it is still gathered by driving goats into the thick forests overgrown with labdanum bushes. The goats eat their fill from the branches and the sticky resin gets stuck on their beards. When they return, their owners carefully comb the resin our of their beards. Also used is a rakelike instrument with long strips of leather attached to it, which they drag across the bushes to collect the resin.\n\nLabdanum strengthens the body and provides warmth and sensuality. It is very grounding.\n\nThe Japanese use Labdanum in their Neriko mixtures, which are used during tea ceremony. Egyptians used it in their Kyphi mixtures and the Hebrews burned it in their temples. Today the perfume industry uses labdanum to add a note of moss and leather to its products.\n\nLabdanum is an excellent medium for making fragrant incense pellets.
