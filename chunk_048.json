Truly Black Seed is one of nature's greatest gifts, and that is probably why it is referred to as the \"seed of blessing.\" The ancient Egyptians and Assyrians recognized the power of this healing herb as early as 3000 years ago. Found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, \"King Tut\", Black Seed was thought to help the Pharaohs in the afterlife. Physicians as far back as the 1st century used Black Seed to treat a variety of ailments and sicknesses.\n\nBlack Seed grows wild in the Mediterranean but has been cultivated in the Arabian Peninsula, Asia and Africa. It's oil, which has a rich composition of more than 100 compounds including essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nBlack Seed is remarkable in that it is one of the few natural, herbal remedies that has been studied by the scientific community and found to have tremendous potential benefit. Today, more and more medical scientists and professionals are recognizing the power of this amazing little seed. It was recently recommended as an herbal remedy by the World Health Organization. Research continues to show the positive results of Black Seed, and it continues to generate excitement throughout the medical industry.\n\nBlack Seed it not commonly found in liquid nutrition products. NuVerus is the first company we know of to focus on this remarkable SuperFood. The Oil of the Black Seed has a strong pepper flavor, which explains why all the other products on the market have excluded it. NuVerus has used advanced manufacturing techniques to combine the Black Seed Oil in a delicious and comprehensive formula with SuperFoods from around the world.\n\n* The statements on this website have not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA).

This is a short-lived perennial, and because it is borderline hardy, plants may be damaged by winter frosts. This may be avoided by leaving the dead stalks until spring, when new growth is evident, before cutting them back. A protective mulch should be added around them in the autumn with leaf mould or compost. They do, however, self-seed liberally and resulting seedlings are stronger and more drought-tolerant than those that are transplanted. This is a superb butterfly plant, rivalling even buddleja. The Royal Horticultural Society have given it the Award of Garden Merit. : http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/961.shtml \n\nThis species grows best in a well-drained soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and needs regular moisture. It has a reputation of rarely being attacked by insect pests, but may be susceptible to powdery mildew. V. bonariensis is commonly grown from seed which germinates readily without pre-treatment, but can also be propagated from herbaceous stem cuttings. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

A chiller with this size is often quite big and bulky, as well as pricey (typically beginning at a couple thousand bucks), to ensure that they are continued sides of structures as well as on roof tops. They tend to be used when business buildings desire to change from city water as they're growing fast enough to warrant it.They're occasionally utilized in place of evaporative cooling towers, against the argument that evaporative cooling towers permit refrigerant substances to come in to direct contact with cooled water, whereas in chillers the refrigerant substances are best kept in a closed-circuit.\n\nhttp://industrialsurplusworld.com\nCall Us ~ 1-800-759-6048\n\nChiller Buyers | Used Chiller Disposal\nchiller buyers, used chiller disposal, chiller disposal, buyer chillers, buyers chiller\n\nCompressors in water chillers usually use one of four distinct compression methods - reciprocating compression, scroll compression, screw-pushed compression, and centrifugal compaction. All these distinct compression procedures has its advantages and pitfalls, like scroll compression being little in proportion as well as cost effective and centrifugal compaction being power efficient. The compressor is a major facet of each water cooling apparatus, and picking out the right sort of compressor is essential for best operation.\n\nA chiller may be found in production conditions where water needs to be at a reasonably accurate temperature to ensure finicky gear or merchandise may be created and suitably used, as one blunder in temperature could lead to a substantial decline.

Because of their less usage of electricity they have been typically chosen by these seeking ideal efficacy of electricity consumption.\n\nOperationing of Chillers\n\nThe working rule of a lab chiller is rather straightforward. The reservoir is full of a fluid, usually water or an ethylene glycol/water combination, to be re-circulated. The reservoir is linked to the gear needed and electricity is given to the chiller. Chiller's capabilities are modulated by the control. consumers can establish the parameters based on their conditions like circulation and strain.

For the same reason, his work explores exchanges between dimensions and means of reproduction rather than an explicit theme. Accordingly, gestures of resurrection, acts of appropriation, translation between media and explorations of exorcism are frequent within his work. His sources are quite varied too: images taken from eBay, old books, major pieces from the history of art, youtube, his own personal collection of ghosts images, among others. As explained by Francesco Manacorda, art critic and curator of the Barbican Centre in London, the photos of the invisible, non-dimensional ghosts are in fact arranged as if to suggest a paradoxical possibility: the mechanical capture of invisible forces by an obsolete medium appears to have something to do with contemporary arts distrust for unquestioned representations of reality, that ambivalent attitude that mixes suspiciousness towards and flirtation with the double meaning of sophistication. \n\nWasted is a selection of recent works produced in Holland and England, where the artist has lived and worked: drawings, paintings, video-animations and photographs that portray real and mediated situations, all anchored in operations of appropriation and simulacra. The works of the show are constructed upon low-resolution images; according to the artist, this low-resolution of the initial source generates an unstable space that is eager to be manipulated. For the same reason, the final pieces suggest sensations of temporal displacement (like in the video Frozen Marks), sound, and movement (like in Drum set). Due to the ways in which they are produced and exhibited, the apparent lack of continuity between each individual piece is precisely a commentary about the constant translation and simultaneity of media, and of the way in which they affect each other creating meaning based on the fictions constructed by their own means. \n\nSome of the pieces of this show were funded by CIFO, a prestigious art foundation based in Miami, as part of its program of commissions. Alongside this award, Francisco Vald\u00e9s  who completed his MA at Goldsmiths College in 1999 - has obtained a number of other grants, like the one given by the Andes Foundation in Latin America and that of the Jan van Eyck Akademie in Maastricht.", "title": "FRANCISCO VALDES \"WASTED\" @ ELAINE LEVY PROJECT", "publishedDate": "2008-12-18T15:25:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zuzWVn23js", "description": "Recorded on January 10, 2012 using a Flip Video camera.", "title": "Theresa on Tuberous Begonias", "publishedDate": "2012-01-10T16:49:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zv3wc45XMM", "description": "This year's Ladies Inter Services Championship cricket is underway in Aldershot.\n\nYesterday's opening match of the tournament saw the Army beat the RAF by five wickets\n\nMeanwhile defending champions the Royal Navy were on course for victory in their clash with the Air Force today (Wednesday).", "title": "Ladies Inter Services Cricket Action 17.07.13", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T13:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zv6AYGDmP0", "description": "Hydrangea paniculata 'Limelight' is een stevige pluimhortensia of boerenhortensia die vaak wordt gebruikt als vervanger voor de populaire maar slappe Hydrangea arborescens 'Annabelle'.\n\nHydrangea paniculata 'Limelight' verkleurt in het najaar naar roze en Hydrangea arborescens 'Annabelle' naar bruin.", "title": "Hydrangea paniculata Limelight", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T11:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zvNkzE8_zM", "description": "Clancy Eccles (9 December 1940, Dean Pen, St. Mary, Jamaica -- 30 June 2005, Spanish Town, Jamaica) was a Jamaican ska and reggae singer, songwriter,", "title": "clancy eccles -  dont brag dont boast", "publishedDate": "2011-08-22T18:14:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zw5h5IYlic", "description": "I thought this fountain was amazing.", "title": "An awesome fountain in Chicago", "publishedDate": "2014-09-13T18:11:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1zwEZuI3VAw", "description": "For a dreamy, soothing soak in the tub this Halloween, try Northern Lights Bath Bomb.

A lot of people who are afflicted with cancer victims think that there is no longer any point in giving up cigarettes since they are already sick. The cigarettes' carcinogens may greatly decrease your body's chance of their body recovering from cancer.\n\nBe mindful that fruits and vegetables that you purchase at the market can sometimes be contaminated. Pesticides are used on these crops to guard against diseases and other issues from causing destruction to the crops.\n\nIf you have a loved one who has recently received a diagnosis of cancer, listen to what they have to say. It may be challenging for you, but they need someone to listen while they express their feelings.\n\nIf you want to catch cancer early, know what symptoms to look for. Losing weight, dark feces and cramping are just a few of the symptoms of colon cancer.You should consult with a medical professional if these symptoms.\n\nYou can dramatically lower your chances of getting colon cancer by about 40% if you engage in regular physical activity.\n\nAcidophilus pills can help a lot in keeping colon cancer at bay.  Probiotics will help excrete toxins, thereby keeping the gut clean.  Colon cancer is a malignancy caused by excessive presence of toxins in the gut.  Probiotics sweep away harmful toxins, thereby maintaining the gut clean.\n\nIf you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with cancer, be sure to read up on the subject.\n\nDrinking soda and other unhealthy beverages may increase your chances of getting cancer. The excessive sugar and calorie content of these drinks can contribute to weight gain, which can further spread the cancer in the body.\n\nDon't be scared to take cancer lying down.This is not the time to back down and roll over, so there's nothing to lose by giving every last bit of effort to survive.\n\nYou cannot allow cancer to win the battle.

They play a vital role in urinary system and it maintains homeostatic functions in our body. Kidneys regulate the electrolytes, maintenance of acid-base balance and regulation of blood pressure (i.e. salt \u2013water balance) . They serve the body as a natural filter of the food and remove wastes which are diverted in to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium. The kidneys also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose & amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitrol, rennin & erythropoietin.\n\nWHAT IS CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE:\nOur kidneys carry out the complex system of filtration in our bodies \u2013 excess waste and fluid material are removed from the blood and excreted from the body. Our kidneys get their blood and oxygen supply from the renal arteries, which are branches of the abdominal aorta (another artery). When it enters the kidneys, blood goes through smaller and smaller blood vessels \u2013 the smallest ones being the glomeruli (tiny capillary blood vessels which are arranged in tufts).\n\n As kidney failure advances, dangerous levels of waste and fluid can rapidly build up in the body. If chronic kidney failure ends in end \u2013stage kidney disease, the patient will not survive without dialysis (artificial filtering) or a kidney transplant.\n\nSYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: \n        Anemia\n Blood in urine\n Dark urine\n Decrease mental alertness \n Decreased urine out put\n Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n Insommia\n Itchy skin\n constipation\n Loss of appetite\n More frequent urination(especially at night)\n Pain on the side (or) mid to lower back\n Protein in urine\n Sudden change in weight\n Unexplained headaches and body pains\n \nWHY SHOULD WE GO TO NADIPATHY?\nMany of the treatments are available to cure kidney disease. But they are giving unnecessary medicines to internal body, that given temporary relief to problem.  It will need much time as months (or) years.  Sometimes they are doing harmful surgeries to kidneys. This will cause side effects to kidney.\nNadipathy treated many of chronic kidney patients without using any medicines.  In our research we find that due to lack of energy to kidneys, it does not work properly to function.  So we are giving sufficient energy to kidneys through certain Nadi\u2019s present in our body. \n\nWE DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM THROUGH:\nNADI DIAGNOSE: \nOur body is making up with 72,000 Nadi\u2019s, all the Nadi\u2019s are inter-linked to every organ function. If there is any blockage to such Nadi, it does not work properly. So those organs get lack of energy to function normally. Before to the treatment, Nadipathy treats on the root cause of particular Nadi blockage through Nadi diagnosis.\n\n TREATMENT METHOD: \nBy using Acupuncture, Acupressure, Marma therapy, Vedic therapy, Magnet therapy, Seed therapy, Massage therapy, Cupping therapy, Detoxifation therapy, Naturopathy, Beach sand therapy, and some other natural therapies to remove the waste materials & excess heat present inside the body. We treat the kidney function as normal with 0% side effects. The duration of the treatment was 1 month.\n Nadipathy treatment will tell you what the healthy lifestyles are for kidney disease patients and what kind of life habits should be avoided. Which kind of patients should do some mild exercises and under what circumstances should patients have good rest and totally avoid exercises.\nNadipathy treatment can not only be used to treat kidney disease, it can also be used by those that are at high risk of developing kidney problems and healthy people to help prevent renal disease and help strengthen the patient\u2019s physical fitness and make them live more healthier life.\nIf Nadipathy treatment is received early, it can help prevent the patient\u2019s kidney functions so as to help avoid entering in to complete kidney failure and avoid dialysis.\n\nFor more information please log on to:\nwww.nadipathy.in\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmHQDL0ILS1Xy3Dj4wy1qNO2\n\nNADIPATHY  KIDNEY  TREATMENT CENTERS\n\n1: KAKINADA\nContact No: 0884-6459111\n2: HYDERABAD\nContact No: 040-65459111", "title": "Kidney Functioning Improvement", "publishedDate": "2013-09-27T12:54:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2-6W2LeGI0E", "description": "Ring-necked Parakeets:\nMale feeding female at, and around nest hole.

It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland, to the west by the Baltic Sea, to the south by Latvia (343 km), and to the east by the Lake Peipsi and the Russian Federation (338.6 km). Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north. The territory of Estonia covers 45,227 km2 (17,462 sq mi), and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. The Estonians are a Finnic people, and the official language, Estonian, is closely related to Finnish.\nPost-independence\nThe US, UK, France, Italy and the majority of other Western democracies considered the annexation of Estonia by the USSR illegal. They retained diplomatic relations with the representatives of the independent Republic of Estonia, never de jure recognized the existence of the Estonian SSR, and never recognized Estonia as a legal constituent part of the Soviet Union. Estonia's return to independence became possible as the Soviet Union faced internal regime challenges, loosening its hold on the outer empire. As the 1980s progressed, a movement for Estonian autonomy started. In the initial period of 1987--1989, this was partially for more economic independence, but as the Soviet Union weakened and it became increasingly obvious that nothing short of full independence would do, the country began a course towards self-determination.\nEstonia joined the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.\nIn 1989, during the \"Singing Revolution\", in a landmark demonstration for more independence, called The Baltic Way, a human chain of more than two million people was formed, stretching through Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. All three nations had similar experiences of occupation and similar aspirations for regaining independence. The Estonian Sovereignty Declaration was issued on 16 November 1988 and formal independence declared on 20 August 1991, reconstituting the pre-1940 state, during the Soviet military coup attempt in Moscow. The Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia on 6 September 1991. The first country to diplomatically recognize Estonia's reclaimed independence was Iceland. The last Russian troops left on 31 August 1994.\nThe 2004 enlargement of the European Union was the largest single expansion of the European Union (EU), both in terms of territory and population, however not in terms of gross domestic product (wealth). Estonia was amongst a group of ten countries which were incorporated into the EU on 1 May 2004.

Where did you learn to do that?\n\nAnnie: Well when we were younger me, Megan, and Lexie all loved to dance but not the same kind of dance. Megan took ballet. Lexie took Irish Step. I took ballroom. Megan was really good, professional level. But she started getting caught up with school and had to stop. I wasnt too bad. I won a few competitions. But I kept hurting myself in class. In one competition though, I had a nasty fall and hurt my back. I decided that it was time to stop. In the end we all couldnt continue.\n\nJoe: Im so sorry. You guys all didnt want to stop yet you had to.\n\nAnnie: Oh me and Megan were okay. We both had gotten as far as we could go and frankly we were getting kind of bored. Lexies the one you should be sorry for.\n\nJoe: What happened with Lexie?\n\nAnnie: Well you might not know that Lexie lives with her dad. Her mom died just 3 years ago. Her dad barely talks to her because he works all the time. In the end he couldnt get anyone to take her and didnt want to pay for lessons anymore. This happened only a year ago. She was champion level. She was really good, incredible. She still practices hoping shell be able to start again.\n\nJoe: Oh my gosh. Poor Lexie.\n\nAnnie: Yeah. But lets not talk about Lexie anymore. I dont think she would want us to.\n\nJoe: Yeah probably.\n\nAnnie: So whats for dessert.\n\nJoe: This. *Waiters bring in chocolate mousse cake with whipped cream.\n\nAnnie: *takes a bite* Mmmmm.

How do you know which one works? You must pay attention to the experts and the experts support green coffee bean extract for weight loss.\n\nWhat is Green Coffee Bean Extract?\n\nGreen coffee beans are basically the coffee beans that have not yet gone through the process of roasting. Roasting reduces chlorogenic acid content which pure green coffee bean has in large amounts. \n\nThis content contains all the benefits of the beans. It is basically responsible for the weight loss benefits of this coffee bean as well as in the prevention of diabetes and heart diseases.\n\nWhat do experts say about pure green coffee bean for weight loss?\n\nThe idea of using green coffee bean extract has not been paid much attention until its debut on television. One of the experts who talked about the weight loss effects of these coffee beans is Lindsay Duncan, the renowned conventional internet doctor. He usually refuses to endorse weight loss supplements but he is backing up this one. Why? \n\nIn a study conducted on January 2012 with 16 human subjects resulted to six subjects considered to be preobese downsizing to their normal weight range. According to Duncan, the participants actually lost 17 percent of body fat in total.\n\nDr Mehmet Oz also expressed support. He actually conducted his own study involving 100 overweight individuals. 50 were given placebos and the other 50 took green coffee bean extract. They were all instructed not to change anything on their diet or exercise routines. After two weeks, the group that took the extract lost an average of 3 pounds. Because of this, Dr Oz concluded that the coffee bean actually doubles your chances of weight loss.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhat makes the green coffee bean work as a weight loss supplement is the chlorogenic acid it contains. According to studies, it changes how the body manages metabolism and blood sugar. With increased metabolic rate and regulated blood sugar level, your body can burn fat more efficiently while giving you more energy to engage in exercise which only further boosts your weight loss results.\n\nThe body does not only burn fat, it is also prompted to burn sugar and prevents it from being stored as fat. The extract also has the ability to bind fat compounds that are found in the digestive system. Such a process prevents the absorption of calories. At the same time, the extract, slows down the release of glucose. As a result, your body utilizes stored fat for energy.\n\nWhy choose Green Coffee Bean Extract Max?\n\nThere are countless green coffee bean extract reviews that prove the effectiveness of this product. But out of all the supplements that carry the name, why exactly would you choose this brand.

It is the primary raw material for such essential neurotransmitters as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Each of these neurotransmitters are vital to healthy brain function. Dopamine carries the \"feel good\" signal that you feel when when you do something good for your body or mind. It is your body's way of incentivizing you to continue doing a specific act. For example, your brain releases a high amount of dopamine during exercise and stretching. Tyrosine can be extracted from many different plant-based sources. \n\n\n00:00:05 Alpha GPC\n00:00:10 Green Tea Extract\n00:00:15 Blueberry Extract\n00:00:20 Acai Extract\n00:00:25 Chia Seed Extract\n00:00:30 Acetyl-Carnitine\n00:00:35 Acetyl-L-Tyrosine\n00:00:40 B5 (Pantothenic Acid)\n00:00:45 B6 (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate)\n00:00:50 C (Ascorbic Acid)\n\nFor more Brain Supplement ingredient info Visit:\nhttp://www.naturalbrainjuice.com/The-Science-s/1833.htm", "title": "Acetyl-L-Tyrosine - Brain Supplements", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T03:15:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2-m1mMUg_kQ", "description": "playground pups dog center, with, daycare, boarding, grooming, training, and a cool dog boutique", "title": "Moose & Harangue.3gp", "publishedDate": "2011-07-09T14:48:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2-mNUcpKOag", "description": "In which secret sister Rosianna (http://youtube.com/rosianna) breaks down her role as John Green's assistant and gives a tour of the London office.

Watch the brand new trailer for Disney\u2019s Cinderella, starring Cate Blanchett, Lily James, Richard Madden, and Helena Bonham Carter. See the film in theatres March 13, 2015.\n\nThe story of \"Cinderella\" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to \"have courage and be kind.\" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.\n\n\nWebsite: http://www.disney.com/Cinderella\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Cinderella\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/disneystudios\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyPictures", "title": "Disney's Cinderella Official US Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "20DG8rtfjhk", "description": "Bayerisches Wei\u00dfbier erfreut sich h\u00f6chster Beliebtheit in aller Welt.

As the third year of the event, thanks to the cooperation of parties related to this event, the public road was closed during the hill climb performance, and that made the racing machine performances possible, which can generally be seen only at circuits.\n\nFrom Honda, the RC213V for FIM Road Racing World Championship Moto GP class joined this event, and performed an exhibition ride. The rider on the machine was Takumi Takahashi, who is now on the top of the ranking for the All Japan Road Race Championship this season.\n\nA test riding with the CBR1000RR was scheduled on Friday, June 13, the day before the event, but, due to the bad weather with hail, Takahashi had no choice but to rehearse with an automobile. He first rode the bike on the course just on the day of the event.\n\nOn Saturday, June 14, the exhibition ride for the event was held twice.

He said: 'It outweighs Dalai'l al-Khayrat by a thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand times.' He said \"a thousand\" twenty times.

Understand the secret of his saying: \"in every glance and every breath, as many times as all the things contained within the Knowledge of Allah, the Great.\"\n\nAnd shaykh Ahmad ibn Idris wrote in a letter to shaykh Muhammad al-Majdhub: \"We mentioned to you that you should send into the khalwa (special retreat of the Sufis under the instruction and guidance of a Teacher) those in whom you see zeal and determination.

Unfortunately, aging is not the only sources of enlarged prostate and also prostate cancer. In this article, we will certainly go over other reasons of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.\n\nI. Reasons of enlarged prostate and prostate cancer cells.\n\n1. Genetic makeup\nGenetic makeup may likewise play a function in bigger prostate given that study shows that prostate cancer as well as bigger prostates can be inherited from generation to generation.\n\n2. Bodily hormone imbalance\nThe exterior look of a regular middle-aged person programs raised abdominal body fat and also shrinking of muscle mass, which is the major aspect triggering bodily hormone discrepancy. Hormone imbalance is likewise induced by sadness, stress, and anxiety that are the most typical emotional problems of bodily hormone discrepancy.\n\n3. Cell-growth element\nFor whatever reason, some folks have implicated in bigger prostate that is a development aspect.\n\n4. Mineral insufficiency\nOur prostate consists of high amounts of zinc to work typically. Zinc insufficiency creates the prostate to enlarge. This could be because of aging or unrestrained diet plan with extreme alcoholic beverages consuming.\n\n5. Obesity\nStudy reveals that uncontrolled diet regimen that is higher in saturated and trans fats are the main source of bodily hormone imbalance that leads to prostate augmentation. Scientist propose that excess calorie intake can somehow directly stimulate prostate enhancement due to the fact that the excess physical body fat that gathers causes an imbalance of hormone degrees.\n\n6. Testosterone\nTestosterone insufficiency might be caused by high amounts of the by-product prolactin of testosterone of men in the body that stimulates even higher productions of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase resulting in a higher quantity of the conversion of testosterone to gihydro-testosterones DHT thus activating prostate enhancement. Excess estrogen seems to be the wrongdoer in prostate enhancement that leads to the pathology and prefers the condo development of prostate cancer.\n\nIII. Signs and symptoms\n\n1. Nocturia.\nNocturia is specified as being stired up during the night several times in order to pass urine. It becomes more common as the person becomes older. This typical pattern perceived among folks with this disorder is a higher variety of times of getting up every evening to urinate for the remainder of their life.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video about prostatitis, please share it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20sAQBVxeEQ", "title": "Prostatitis-Learn What It Is And How To Heal An Enlarged Prostate With Prostate Massage For Men", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T17:31:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "20sFdx6Bc5g", "description": "Ju&Ku - Dresdens latenighteste Show der Welt. findet aller 2 Monate in der Dresdner Groovestation (www.groovestation.de) statt mit Thomas Jurisch und Michael Kuhn. www.ju-und-ku.de", "title": "Pater Theodosius - Sch\u00f6ner Morden mit der Bibel - Ju&Ku", "publishedDate": "2008-04-04T18:20:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "20sTJgmVb-4", "description": "Greater Kudu Female, face and ears Ithala", "title": "Southern Africa Mammals: Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) Female, face and ears", "publishedDate": "2012-05-06T23:11:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "20sVuRWQARc", "description": "Von Mises Stress in an FEA model of a bilateral molar bite in Phyllostomus elongatus\n\nVideo created using VCollab - http://www.vcollab.com/", "title": "FEA Model of Phyllostomus elongatus (Axial Slicing)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-01T16:13:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "20sezypYFoI", "description": "Sue Hale PT describes her experiences using the Microlight ML830\u00ae Laser for Smoking Cessation.

I am not going to listed preaching of moral from such people. What I managed to do in Akahlkalaki completely wiped any support to such separatists in the region. I built the railway, motorways, so you can visit Tbilisi and resorts. There was provided agricultural equipment, gas, electricity and Russian military base was removed. Such separatists like yourself working for Russian intelligence are not entitled to preach  me moral! You were sentenced to prison as per 6 articles and the person who released you really embarrassed himself.

Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek) is a student at Camden College, a well-respected private school on the East Coast. Sean is attracted to Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon), a high minded and seemingly unapproachable coed, while Lauren is infatuated with Victor (Kip Pardue), a handsome but self-centered ladies' man. Lauren's empty-headed roommate, Lara (Jessica Biel), is also attracted to Victor, while he has no qualms about being involved with both. Lauren used to date affected snob Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder), but Paul, a bisexual, currently lusts after Sean. Meanwhile, friendly campus drug dealer Rupert (Clifton Collins Jr.) finds a ready market for cocaine among his classmates; Sean, a steady customer, finds himself financially embarrassed and begins dealing drugs to help pay off his debts, while leading Paul on for his ready supply of marijuana. The Rules Of Attraction also features Eric Stoltz as Mr. Lance Lawson, Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz as semi-concerned parents, and Fred Savage as one of Sean's customers.\n\n\"the rules of attraction\",\"the rules of attraction clip\",\"the rules of attraction full\",\"faye dunaway\",\"swoosie kurtz\",\"ian somerhalder\",\"russell sams\",\"cigarette videos\",\"drink videos\",\"sunglasses videos\",\"wine glass videos\",\"independent comedies\",\"independent dramas\",comedy,\"dark humor black comedies\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"gay lesbian\",\"gay lesbian comedies\",independent,indie,\"michael paseornek\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++266882,/m/0gf9y_3,/m/044mvs,/m/0hwbd,/m/05typm", "title": "The Rules of Attraction (3/10) Movie CLIP - Dick (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T20:52:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "20tx4ntCbV4", "description": "Esse \u00e9 o 22\u00ba epis\u00f3dio da 2\u00aa temporada da s\u00e9rie M\u00f4nica Toy.

Al\u00e9m de flavonoides, vitaminas A, B1 e B6 ela tamb\u00e9m apresenta minerais como f\u00f3sforo, ferro, pot\u00e1ssio, magn\u00e9sio e c\u00e1lcio.\n\nOutro famoso componente da acerola \u00e9 o carotenoide, subst\u00e2ncia respons\u00e1vel pela cor vermelha da fruta, e mais, considerada antioxidante, o que indica que auxilia na preven\u00e7\u00e3o do envelhecimento precoce das c\u00e9lulas.\n\nMas seus componentes ben\u00e9ficos n\u00e3o param por a\u00ed. A acerola \u00e9 a fruta que apresenta o maior teor de vitamina C.\n\nAlgumas variedades desta fruta alcan\u00e7am at\u00e9 5.000 ml de vitamina C por 100 g de polpa. Ainda dentro das estat\u00edsticas, a acerola possui 100 vezes mais vitamina C do que o lim\u00e3o, 20 vezes mais do que a goiaba e 10 vezes mais do que o caju ou a amora.\n\nEm outras palavras, consumir 3 a 4 frutinhas destas pode suprir a necessidade di\u00e1ria de vitamina C de um adulto.\n\nVale ressaltar que quanto mais verde for a fruta, mais vitamina C oferecer\u00e1, logo uma fruta verde escura apresentar\u00e1 90% mais de vitamina C e 50% menos de a\u00e7\u00facares.\n\nAinda, se compararmos a acerola e a laranja, descobriremos algo interessante. A acerola possui mais vitamina A do que a laranja.\n\nEsta vitamina \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por prevenir doen\u00e7as como a cegueira noturna. A quantidade di\u00e1ria recomendada de vitamina A \u00e9 de 900 microgramas para homens e 700 para mulheres.\n\nNeste sentido, enquanto a laranja nos oferece 20 microgramas dessa vitamina a acerola surge como a campe\u00e3 em teores, apresentando 76 microgramas.\n\nMas como tudo isso influencia nas propriedades da fruta? Vejamos.\n\n \n\nPROPRIEDADES DA ACEROLA\n \n\n- Por ser a fruta com maior teor em vitamina C, a acerola apresenta propriedades antioxidantes al\u00e9m de estimular a s\u00edntese de col\u00e1geno, componente fundamental para manter a sa\u00fade dos ossos e tecidos conectivos.\n\n- Tamb\u00e9m combate \u00e0 fadiga, esgotamento nervoso e estresse, al\u00e9m de contar com propriedades anti-infecciosas, que ajudam a estimular as defesas do organismo.\n\n- Devido a sua riqueza em minerais a acerola \u00e9 um bom remineralizante, sua alta concentra\u00e7\u00e3o em flavonoides e antocianinas lhe conferem propriedades antioxidantes, tornando-a eficaz na preven\u00e7\u00e3o de doen\u00e7as como o c\u00e2ncer e card\u00edacas.\n\n- Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 indicada para auxiliar em casos de afec\u00e7\u00f5es pulmonares, tratamento de disenterias, cicatriza\u00e7\u00e3o de feridas, gripes, hemorragias nasais e gengivais, dores musculares, reumatismo, anemia, doen\u00e7as do f\u00edgado e dietas para pessoas em recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de desgastes f\u00edsicos ou desnutridas, dentre outras.\n\n \nTags:Os incr\u00edveis benef\u00edcios da acerola ,Sucos Para Emagrecer, Dicas pr\u00e1ticas para acelerar o metabolismo ,Dieta Masculina para Perder Barriga!,como perder gordura abdominal,como perder barriga r\u00e1pido,dieta f\u00e1cil,dieta para perder peso r\u00e1pido,o que fazer para emagrecer,emagrecimento r\u00e1pido.\n\nLink do v\u00eddeo:  http://youtu.be/214cqVKtyto", "title": "Os incr\u00edveis benef\u00edcios da acerola:", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T14:33:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "214xG5aYqOo", "description": "", "title": "Comadreja  (Mustela nivalis)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T20:56:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "21561vHyDlE", "description": "One of Australia's most successful eel farms, uses the GROBEST SE diet to grow and fatten their eels.

The diet limits foods which cause blood sugar spikes so that you can maintain energy levels high enough to reverse insulin sensitivity issues with exercise and weight loss. The insulin diet also aids in weight loss because it replaces empty calories for nutritious calories. Instead of filling up on snacks and refined sugars you fill up instead on healthy foods.\n\nPoor insulin sensitivity is the precursor to more serious conditions such as Diabetes and it is one of the main elements of Syndrome X, which is a basket of conditions that all increase your risk for developing diabetes, stroke, or heart disease. This condition on its own is also cause for concern because it feeds itself. When you are resistant to insulin or insensitive to insulin your body requires more of it to metabolize blood sugar and moderate your blood glucose levels.\n\nThis condition feeds itself because these high blood glucose levels make you feel sluggish and make you less likely to exercise or even stay active throughout the day. Unfortunately you need to stay active and exercise regularly to begin reversing insulin resistance.\n\nThe insulin resistance diet is basically a tool that people with insulin resistance can use to help aid the reversal of the condition. It is well known that the best treatment for this condition is breaking the cycle of decline by exercising and losing weight however your diet helps feed the lethargy that makes exercise difficult. If you can successfully switch your diet to an insulin friendly diet you will improve your chances at fighting the underlying condition.\n\nThe insulin resistance diet is not even solely reserved for those trying to reverse the stages of resistance. If you are looking to drop weight and blood pressure or simply want more energy for exercise this diet is for you. It will help you find the results you are looking for and will set you up for a longer healthier life.\n\nBri writes on many related health topics.

Rather called as a universal religion...it is the final part/revelation after the Bible revealed on Jesus & the Torah revealed on Moses......unlike the previous revelations from GOD Almighty This holy revelation will remain authentic till day of judgement even till eternity and it is for the whole MANKIND not only for a particular group of people but for the whole humanity (whole mankind)......MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT ABRAHAM WAS THE PROPHET OF THE GOD , YONAH(YUNUS) WAS THE PROPHET OF THE GOD, JESUS(ISA`a) WAS THE PROPHET OF THE GOD ....SAME WITH ADAM.....Abraham\n(Ibrahim), Aaron(Harun) , Joseph(Yusuf), Noah(Nuh/Nooh), Jacob(Yakoob), AARON(HARUN) , David(Dawood), Solomon (Sulaimaan) etc.....BUT THE LAST & THE FINAL MESSANGER IS PROPHET MUHAMMED (PEACE BE UPON HIM). The revelation known as Quran(Koran) is the last and final revelation revealed on prophet Muhammed by Allah (The Almighty GOD) through Arch angel Gabriel (Jibreel)\nThe four line definition of GOD from the holy qura`an chapter number 112 verses 1 to 4 which states that : -\nSay that he is (GOD)Allah the one & only, Allah(GOD) the absolute & the eternal, he begets not nor he is begotten & there is nothing like him\nHow great will be the regret of those who waste the opportunity!\n\"There are two blessings which many people lose: good health and free time.\" [al-Bukhari]\nSPREAD PEACE !!

They all brought the same message: worship only God, and stop worshiping human beings and their ideas.\nBecome a Muslim Now: If you believe there is only One God who should be worshiped, and no one/nothing else has that right but Him, and you believe Muhammad, peace be upon him, was a messenger who brought the same message as all the prophets before him, then you are basically a Muslim.\n\nThe Holy Quran is the last and the final revelation from Almighty GOD which is still in its authentic form since 1400 years, and the Holy Quran is the last and the final revelation on the last and the final messanger Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) as authentic as it was revealed i.e. unchanged till date and will remain authentic forever.....\n\nVerily all praise belongs to All\u00e2h, we praise Him, seek His Aid and His Forgiveness. Whomsoever All\u00e2h guides there is none to misguide and whomsoever All\u00e2h misguides there is none to guide. I testify that there is none deserving of worship except All\u00e2h alone without any partners and I testify that Muhammad sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam is His servant and His Messenger.\n\nIndeed all the praises are due to Allah, we praise Him and we seek His assistance and forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allah from the evil of ourselves and our bad deeds, whoever Allah guides there is none that can misguide him and whoever is lead astray there is none that can guide him, and I bear witness there is no God other than Allah, He has no partners, and I bear witness that Muhammad (pbuh) is His servant and messenger.\n\n\nThese are my few blogs :-\n\n\nwww.quranmagic.blogspot.com\n\nwww.truthmiracles.blogspot.com\n\nwww.muhammedsunnah.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamthegreatestreligion.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamauthenticreligion.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamvshinduism.blogspot.com\n\nwww.hinduismisislam.blogspot.com\n\n www.atheismvsislam.blogspot.com\n\n www.sikhismandislam.blogspot.com\n\n www.islamtruereligiontv.blogspot.com\n\n www.buddhismislam.blogspot.com\n\n www.islamparsi.blogspot.com \n\nwww.islamjudaism.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamjesus.blogspot.com\n\nwww.truepathz.blogspot.com\n\nwww.hadithz.blogspot.com\n\nwww.themysticalmeadows.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamintroduction.blogspot.com\n\nwww.allahsdhikr.blogspot.com\n\nwww.quranrevelation.blogspot.com\n\nwww.jennahparadise.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamandbible.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islambible.blogspot.com\n\nwww.thousandduruds.blogspot.com\n\nwww.thousandsalaams.blogspot.com\n\nwww.islamrealreligion.blogspot.com", "title": "Question - Mouthwash Containing Alcohol ? - Halal Or Haram", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T10:09:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "21ILsK0FizQ", "description": "Rick Burke sings Roy Payne's \"I Wouldn't Take A Million Dollars For A Single Maple Leaf\".\nTo contact Rick, call (709) 754-0052", "title": "I Wouldn't Take A Million Dollars For A Single Maple Leaf", "publishedDate": "2010-12-22T16:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "21IQJXz6CMI", "description": "", "title": "ava 2011 10 14 18 55 23 017", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T09:12:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "21IUVtpcrEs", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez les conseils de David G\u00e9linas, pharmacien propri\u00e9taire affili\u00e9 Brunet pour cesser de fumer", "title": "La cessation tabagique avec David Ge\u0301linas", "publishedDate": "2013-09-27T13:14:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "21IcpkxgBVY", "description": "An improved method to make \"Hot Ice\" sodium acetate from vinegar and baking soda.\n\nBoiling down the sodium acetate solution to exactly the right level is key to making sodium acetate work. Since most of you don't have precise glassware like I do, you can follow this new method of boiling to get the concentration just right.\n\nSimply make a raw sodium acetate solution like in our previous video at this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpEZWdPIg9o\n\nBut instead of boiling down 90%, just watch the surface of the boiling liquid.\n\nAs you pass the key concentration for making hot ice, a crust of sodium acetate will start to form on the surface. As soon as you see this crust take it off heating. While it is still hot, stir the mixture and add a small amount of water, usually just a spoonful or so, to redissolve the crust.\n\nIt should still smell like vinegar, if it does not, there was not enough vinegar in the original mixture. So you'll need to add another quarter-cup to half-cup of vinegar and boil it back down while looking for the crust. Once again stir it and add water.\n\nKeep repeating the vinegar addition and boiling until the boiled liquid has a faint smell of vinegar.\n\nOnce you have the clear, hot, vinegar smelling liquid, place a covering it and then cool it in the fridge until it becomes cold to the touch.\n\nNow you're at exactly the right concentration to do hot ice.\n\nTo initiate the crystallization or \"freezing\" process, just drop in a solid piece of sodium acetate. You can get this by scraping off some of the crust earlier and then saving it separately.\n\nTouching is not a reliable way to initiate crystallization, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.\n\nPlease subscribe, rate and comment!\n\nSpecial Notes: \n\nIf you have bad sodium acetate from previous experiments, you can \"fix\" it by heating it  and adding water until it completely dissolves. Then follow the boiling instructions in this video (including the vinegar addition if needed) to fix bad sodium acetate. \n\nBut if you have dirty sodium acetate then it won't be fixable by this method.\n\nI don't think i'm emphasizing how important the following two points are: IT MUST SMELL LIKE VINEGAR AND BE TOTALLY CRUST-FREE before you can put it into the fridge. Otherwise, it WILL freeze automatically or turn to a mush.\n\nIf you want to know the temperature of hot ice as it freezes, click here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAwxhAP9mnc\n\nIf you want to reuse/remelt your sodium acetate after it has solidified, put it into the microwave and heat it until it *just* starts to boil. Then take it out and stir it until it completely dissolves. If it does not completely dissolve even when its really hot then add in water until it dissolves. Once it's completely dissolved cover it and put it in the fridge.\n\nFAQ: The yellow thing in the bottom when I'm adding the baking soda and boiling is a magnetic stir bar that stirs the ingredients.", "title": "Make Sodium Acetate \"Hot Ice\" with vinegar and baking soda (Pt2)", "publishedDate": "2009-01-31T02:11:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "21JLIKdkI_8", "description": "The Jazz of Entrepreneurship\nHet werk van de leider van een organisatie wordt vaak vergeleken met dat van een dirigent van een klassiek orkest : v\u00f3\u00f3r de groep staan, richting kiezen, medewerkers motiveren... Tijdens deze workshop laten we zien dat de activiteiten van een ondernemer veel meer lijken op die van een jazz musicus. Het belang van creativiteit, het gebruik \"het onverwachte\" als bron van innovatie, het optimaal inzetten van beschikbare middelen zijn allemaal elementen die makkelijker kunnen teruggevonden worden in de muziek van een jazz band dan in die van een klassiek orkest. \nIn de workshop gebruiken we live jazz muziek om duidelijk te maken hoe een jazz band werkt. Analogie\u00ebn met de activiteiten van ondernemers worden uitgewerkt en ge\u00efllustreerd via de muziek. Aan de basis van de workshop liggen de inzichten uit Effectuation van Prof. Saras Sarasvathi. Er worden lessen getrokken en inzichten geformuleerd over wat managers kunnen leren van ondernemers \u00e9n van jazz musici bij het aansturen van hun organisatie.  \nInnovatief, swingend, verrassend en veel ruimte voor creativiteit.

To find them you have to learn their ticking calls, know where to look and be able to approach without alarming them. As finches go, this is a real monster, almost as big as Redwing, and with a huge bill capable of cracking cherry stones. They are basically orangey-brown in plumage with one massive white wing bar and a white tip to the tail. The bill is grey-black in summer, horn-coloured in winter and has a distinctive black surround.\n\nHabitat\n\nBreeds in broad-leaved woodlands and parks. Winters in woodlands, particularly those with hornbeam, plum, cherry or yew.\n\nBehaviour\n\nFinch bills vary in both size and 'pointedness' so that each species is able to feed on different types of seed and therefore avoid competing with others. In Hawfiches this has been taken to the extreme, creating a huge bill capable of cracking seeds as large as cherry stones which other finches couldn't cope with. The large head is testament to the size of the muscles needed to operate such a bill.\n\nMigration\n\nHawfinches are sedentary although those from Scandinavia and eastern Europe will migrate south and west and some of these occasionally reach Britain. Usually though, they concentrate around the Mediterranean where flocks of several hundred have been noted in Porrtugal, Gibraltar and the Nile Delta.", "title": "Hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes) in my garden", "publishedDate": "2012-07-29T22:13:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "21OpciE7IvA", "description": "Adventures with heavy: Heavy eat at Mcdonalds", "title": "Heavy eats at McDonalds", "publishedDate": "2010-09-18T01:21:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "21P-n30XkUA", "description": "Directed by Herschel Godfrey", "title": "Fervency", "publishedDate": "2011-12-29T14:44:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "21POpmKlD60", "description": "Here is the link to the written instructions for this recipe :\nhttp://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art173158.asp", "title": "Hoisin Grilled Chicken Recipe", "publishedDate": "2011-10-12T15:34:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "21PUpMp0vnk", "description": "3.4 mmr", "title": "Dota2 quelling blade run : Im just a support,btm lane tree chop run/juke", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T06:14:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "21QVczp8s5M", "description": "", "title": "3rd Annual Hurdy Gurdy Festival Youlgrave: Nyckelharpa Duo", "publishedDate": "2009-05-19T22:49:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "21R77Zkyk1E", "description": "Learn essential skills, marketing, social media, mobile apps for notaries and more with the Marketing for Notary Professionals eBook.

In the prologue Duchamp appears on a reddish cosmos background, in a double-reflection version, male and female (let us recall Duchamps female identity, Rose S\u00e9lavy created in New York in 1920, with which the artist signed various works). But death comes to kidnap the superior part of our double hero, and lets the other one drop down towards the earth. Just like in the Platonic myth, the Convito, the unity of the androgynous is broken and the fallen Marcel (or Rose) will have to complete ten different tasks inside a museum before he/she will be able to reunite with his/her other half and renew the universe in a cosmic conflagration. Inside the museum, the paintings and the sculpture (there is only one  Michelangelos David) our hero/heroine meets on his way come to life and threaten him/her.\nWhat if the destiny, not only of art, but of all of Western culture, had been decided between 726 and 787 A.D., i.e., between the destruction of sacred images ordered by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III Isaurico and the following council of Nicea, which, on the contrary, declared the lawfulness of their cult?\nImages continue to have a central role  even after the decline of the Christian religion as a crucial means of social cohesion  in the secularised and disenchanted society which has formed in the course of modernity. The victory of iconolatry between the VIII and IX Century of the vulgar era, in other words, could have marked the West in an irreversible way.\nThe only way to really come to terms with the art of our past is by freeing it from the ideological and habitual incrustations, which have transformed some masterpieces into common places of a diffuse and banal culture.\nConcept and Design: Lorenzo

All conditions if properly diagnosed can be effectively and successfully treated. But the most important thing is that a child showing early signs of the disorder shall be dealt with the soonest possible. The following are the common conditions affecting alopecia children.\n1.Tinea capitis or ringworm of the scalp is a result of a fungal infection affecting the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, In some cases, the hair shafts and follicles are being attacked. This disease is believed to be a form of superficial mycosis or dermatophytosis. It is an irregular condition that appears as small bald lesions. In other instances though, broken-off hair may be visible. The diagnosis can be as simple as evaluating the appearance of the affected area to determine the signs of fungal infection, if any. The incidence of this condition id continuously rising. I not given proper attention and treatment, it is possibly contagious.\n2.Alopecia areata of loss of hair in patches. Other alopecia cases are developed over time or it may occur at birth but this condition is exceptional because it can develop overnight and in other instances, in over a few days.Around one in every 1, 000 children get alopecia areata. Onother effect of this disorder is the possible distortion of the nails wherein the nails may appear brittle and in worst cases, totally damaged. Special attention should be given to children with this condition as it is more likely to develop more severe alopecia cases such as alopecia universalis which is total body hair loss.\n3.Trauma to the hair shaft which is commonly causes by wearing tight braids and ponytails, friction and chemical burns. Hair loss in this condition appears as lesions. There is no total loss of hair. Broken-off hair in different lengths may appear at the surface of the scalp. The good news is that re-growth is very possible given that the hair trauma is not severe.\n\nAnother cause of hair loss in children is cancer. In all cases though, the sudden changes can be traumatic. Hence, making the transition as smooth as possible for the childs sake can provide a lot of comfort.", "title": "Is the PKS2 ok for sleepovers?", "publishedDate": "2010-05-11T16:58:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "21Y3E-b60qk", "description": "Pomba apaixonada e solit\u00e1ria, Can\u00e7\u00e3o de amor, A vida como ela \u00e9, Tramas da natureza, Dove passionate and lonely, Love Song, Life as it is, Wefts of nature, Dove passionn\u00e9e et solitaire, Cadres de la nature, de la vie telle qu'elle est, Dove apasionada y solitaria, Marcos de la naturaleza, la vida como es, Dove leidenschaftlich und einsam, Life Love Song, Frames der Natur, wie sie ist, Cornici della Natura, la vita cos\u00ec com'\u00e8,", "title": "Pomba apaixonada e solit\u00e1ria, Can\u00e7\u00e3o de amor, A vida como ela \u00e9, Tramas da natureza,", "publishedDate": "2012-11-29T19:55:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "21Y6lLHezfw", "description": "Head Coach Mike Smith's message for the team after Sunday's hard fought 19-17 division win over the Carolina Panthers reiterated what the team has been focused on for the past few weeks: being 1-0 and starting over.", "title": "Postgame Speech: 1-0 Mentality", "publishedDate": "2014-11-16T23:22:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "21YuGC7Qdfo", "description": "Here's a dual cover with my good friend Matt Perrin.

On this evening, officers responded to a complaint of two young performers soliciting for money on the train. Two male passengers, and friends of Bowe, were approached by officers at the Lake Merritt station, with a witness who identified the two young men as the guilty suspects. The men were instructed by the officers to get off the train for questioning. Some of the train's passengers stood up for the youth, telling the officers that young people they were looking for had already gotten off the train at the West Oakland station and that these three riders had not been engaged in the solicitation of passengers.\n\nBowe, a 19-year-old African American female and full-time student of a local security-training program, repeatedly iterated the group's innocence, telling the officers that they were in violation of the young men's rights. This \"challenge\", as well as mounting vocal pressure from other BART riders, agitated the officers who forcibly removed Bowe from the train. One officer threw the 5'0\" tall, 105 pound teen into the platform and repeatedly \"roughed her up\" according to one passenger. \"They kept slamming her around..her mouth was full of blood\" as she was ushered by her attackers to the Lake Merritt station holding cell in preparation for transport to Santa Rita County Jail on one felony and three misdemeanor charges.\n\nBowe's first experience with the law quickly intensified at Santa Rita where she was taunted, battered, and denied serious medical care, as well as the usage of phone privileges by deputies at the County Jail; a jail whose condition is reported to be torturous in-and-of itself. \"Three male guards and one female guard came in my cell and beat me up. They hit me then said that I assaulted one of them..they chained my wrists to my ankles and tipped me over onto the urine-soaked ground so I couldn't get up. I could tell they were trying to break my spirit\" says Bowe about the four-night stay that resulted in two additional arrest charges being tacked to her quickly growing rap sheet.\n\nNubia is not yet out of the woods. As a result of the felony arrest, she was kicked out of her training program at the Treasure Island Job Corp where she was only 2 months away from graduation; she is facing criminal charges that can potentially impact the rest of her life, and she will forever have to deal with the trauma of her experiences.", "title": "Defend Nubia (#1)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T16:36:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "21d5kcjJGy8", "description": "How To Change Oakley Flak Jacket Lens by Specs Eyewear\n\nwww.specsrx.com", "title": "How To Change Oakley Flak Jacket Lens by Specs Eyewear", "publishedDate": "2014-01-05T03:31:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "21dLm8FzqNg", "description": "Learn how to lay carpet on stairs, beginning with nailing down tack stripping or tackless, cutting and stapling the underpad onto each step, trimming and stapling the carpet to the top nosing, stapling it into the top of the riser, using a tapping wedge and hammer to hook the carpet and get a tight corner, stapling into the bottom riser, continuing on by stapling into the top of the next riser, using a tapping wedge and hammer again, and stapling into the bottom of the riser; note that you use about three times more staples in the top of the riser, compared with the bottom, since the carpet is also hooked on the tack stripping on the tread.", "title": "Installing Carpet: Laying Carpet on Stairs", "publishedDate": "2013-01-03T17:04:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "21e7gF0PtNs", "description": "I own nothing.", "title": "Naya Rivera, Cory Monteith & John Stamos auction off \"Sweet lady kisses\" at the Glaad Awards.", "publishedDate": "2012-03-30T13:18:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "21e8a0pi4-U", "description": "", "title": "Chrysanthemum Digital Book Talk", "publishedDate": "2011-02-03T04:09:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "21eF0u_h4Io", "description": "Vielen Dank f\u00fcr die Nominierung der TMK St. Martin!\n\nWir nominieren die Bauernmusikkapelle St. Johann, Eschenauer Tanzlmusi & Musikkapelle G\u00fcssing ;)", "title": "Cold Water Challenge 2014 - B\u00fcrgermusikkapelle St. Johann im Pongau", "publishedDate": "2014-08-01T20:35:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "21etlGI4AwM", "description": "", "title": "LIANGMAI (UBC-Women society) - Aliu tinggen wang tang de sai", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T06:03:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "21f1QxiGQ2A", "description": "In computer programming, SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers for the \"first five principles\" named by Robert C.

WHY!   \nSubstantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services, slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather. Air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely. Populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow, such as skis, snowshoes, and sleds pulled by horses, dogs, or other animals and later, snowmobiles. Basic utilities such as electricity, telephone lines, and gas supply can also fail. In addition, snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck.   Snowfall can have a small negative effect on yearly yield from solar photovoltaic systems.\nThe combined effects can lead to a \"snow day\" on which gatherings such as school or work are officially canceled. In areas that normally have very little or no snow, a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall, since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow. In some areas, such as some states in the United States, schools are given a yearly quota of snow days (or \"calamity days\"). Once the quota is exceeded, the snow days must be made up.   In other states, all snow days must be made up.  For example, schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon, shorten spring break, or delay the start of summer vacation.\nAccumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer, and to decrease the long-term impact of a heavy snowfall. This process utilizes shovels, snowplows and snow blowers and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based chemicals, which reduce the melting temperature of snow.  In some areas with abundant snowfall, such as Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses. This allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning, which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods.\nFresh snow reflects 90% or more of ultraviolet radiation,  which causes snow blindness, also reducing absorption of sunlight by the ground. Snow blindness (also known as ultraviolet keratitis, photokeratitis or niphablepsia) is a painful eye condition, caused by exposure of unprotected eyes to the ultraviolet (UV) rays in bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice.  This condition is a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes,  as with every 300 meters (980 ft) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of UV rays increases by 4%. Snow's large reflection of light makes night skies much brighter, since reflected light is directed back up into the sky.   However, when there is also cloud cover, light is then reflected back to the ground. This greatly amplifies light emitted from city lights, causing the 'bright night' effect. A similar brightening effect occurs when no snow is falling and there is a full moon and a large amount of snow.", "title": "I Don't Want A White Christmas!  I Hate SNOW!  WTF?  WHY?

The x runs horizontally, and the y runs vertically. They meet at the origin, whose coordinates are 0, 0. The first coordinate is where the point lies on the x axis and the second coordinate is where the point lies on the y axis. Up and to the right are the positive directions and down and to the left are negative directions for both axes.\n\nSee the example of (3, 4) above.\u00a0Since three is the x coordinate, you must count three spaces to the right. From there, count four spaces up because four is the y coordinate.\n\nBased on the signs of your coordinates, you can tell where a given point will lie on the coordinate plane. The plane is divided into four quadrants and labeled I through IV starting in the upper right and rotating counter-clockwise, as shown above.\n\nPoints found in quadrant I have coordinates that are both positive. Points found in quadrant II have a negative x coordinate and a positive y coordinate. Points found in quadrant III have coordinates that are both negative. And points found in quadrant IV have a positive x coordinate and a negative y coordinate.\n\nUse these guidelines to determine what quadrant your point will be in before you actually graph it so you can check your work afterwards.\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-graph-on-a-coordinate-plane/", "title": "How to Graph on a Coordinate Plane", "publishedDate": "2011-04-29T20:42:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "221XYczkq3c", "description": "To Subscribe Quickhealth4u Channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj18UWdCmx48viHaiQ8Xu3A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe Thedivine4u\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy83QmbvZ3t0Dst0l73wFrA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe utubefoods\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV68yoHRFXdTpmTkXKPyjVg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe Easy Recipes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOrEf90ucqDhcmLBf9Ibgg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nTo Subscribe Bhakthi Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQlh660XHM2YKhtFHrw6I4A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe My3 Audio Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtM045hVJF4nm2fQ9CYnsZQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe 70mmcinema Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHIO6iT39FDxqL3WduOi6Zg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe MY3 Health Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuueSzVUIlEScfU_SFHlgZw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTo Subscribe utubetip\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF-CaCXs7-hrR-IqZ6Ishlg?sub_confirmation=1.\n\nFor more Information on\nwww.my3music.com\nwww.shanthiinfo.com List of Our Recipes,\n\nchicken recipes,\nmeatloaf recipe,\nbanana bread recipe,\nchili recipe,\npancake recipe,\ncrock pot recipes,\nlasagna recipe,\nfrench toast recipe,\ndinner ideas,\nhealthy recipes,\nchicken breast recipes,\ndiabetic recipes\n\n\nsalmon recipes,\napple pie recipe,\npork chop recipes,\nshrimp recipes,\nchicken salad recipe,\ncheesecake recipe,\n\nslow cooker recipes,\n\n\nsmoothie recipes,\nvegan recipes,\neggplant recipes,\n\n\n\nbiscuit recipe,\nkale recipes,\ncupcake recipes,\npumpkin pie recipe,\ncookie recipes,\ncrockpot recipes,\nRecipe,\ndessert recipes,\nvegetarian recipes,\nsoup recipes,\nfried rice recipe,\neasy dinner recipes,\nground turkey recipes,\npecan pie recipe,\nspaghetti squash recipes,\napple crisp recipe,\n\nsweet potato recipes,\npasta recipes,\nhamburger recipes,\ncarrot cake recipe,\nbaked chicken recipes,\nchicken soup recipe,\njam recipe,\nbanana pudding recipe,\ngumbo recipe,\ncrab cake recipe,\nzucchini recipes,\npotato salad recipe,\npotato soup recipe,\nbutternut squash recipes,\nlow carb recipes,\neasy recipes,\ncake recipes\nsalad recipes\n\n\nhealthy dinner recipes\ndinner recipes\ndesserts\nthanksgiving recipes\nasparagus recipes\npasta salad recipe\ncabbage recipes\nappetizer recipes\nbreakfast recipes\n\n\n\nchicken thigh recipes\ntofu recipes\nDinner\neasy chicken recipes\npad thai recipe", "title": "Classic Tossed Salad - Top Recipes - Best Recipes", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T17:34:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "221aSy9tLlI", "description": "Mando Diao with Black Saturday @ Lowlands 2014", "title": "Mando Diao - Black Saturday - Lowlands 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-15T18:46:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "221aodFXomw", "description": "This video was created for a Poverty in Canada class.

It is also Northrop Grumman's first trans-Atlantic cooperation with Germany and EADS Defence & Security.\n\nBased on the Block 20 configuration, Euro Hawk\u00ae will be equipped with a new signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission system developed by EADS Defence & Security, providing standoff capability to detect electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) emitters.\n\nA ground station consisting of a mission control and launch and recovery elements will be provided by Northrop Grumman. EADS Defence & Security will provide a SIGINT ground station, which will receive and analyze the data from Euro Hawk\u00ae as part of an integrated system solution.\n\nWith a wingspan larger than a commercial airliner, endurance of more than 30 hours and a maximum altitude of more than 60,000 feet, Euro Hawk\u00ae is an interoperable, modular and cost-effective replacement to the aging fleet of manned Breguet Atlantic aircraft, which have been in service since 1972 and will be retired in 2010.\n\nNorthrop Grumman and EADS Defence & Security initiated the trans-Atlantic Euro Hawk\u00ae program in 2000 with the goal of developing an unmanned, wide-area, surveillance and reconnaissance system that would bring together the companies' respective expertise in UAS and sensor technology. A bilateral agreement between the U.S. Air Force and the German Ministry of Defence signed in October 2001 included the operation of the HALE UAS concept, sensor integration and the Nordholz flight demonstration program in the Euro Hawk\u00ae development.\n\nIn October 2003, a U.S. Air Force Global Hawk equipped with an EADS ELINT sensor prototype successfully completed a series of demonstration flights from the German Navy's Nordholz Air Base over the North Sea. The flights marked the first HALE UAS flights to take place in German airspace.\n\nThe German Ministry of Defence awarded a contract in January 2007 to EuroHawk GmbH for the development, test and support of the Euro Hawk\u00ae SIGINT system. Formed as a 50-50 joint venture company by Northrop Grumman and EADS Defence & Security, EuroHawk GmbH acts as the national prime contractor for the German Ministry of Defence throughout the lifecycle of the Euro Hawk\u00ae system.\n\nIn June 2010, the Euro Hawk\u00ae successfully completed its first flight from Northrop Grumman's Palmdale, Calif., facility to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Its ferry flight to Germany is anticipated in early 2011, with subsequent systems expected for delivery between 2016 and 2017 following successful testing and introduction in German operational service.", "title": "Northrop Grumman - Euro Hawk 1st Flight", "publishedDate": "2010-07-15T02:01:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "227SDRWN_IA", "description": "", "title": "STX-R 1200 \u300015F\u4ed5\u69d8\u3000\uff33\uff2f\uff32\uff25\uff38\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u4ed8\u304d\uff08\u66f8\u985e\u306a\u3057\uff09", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T17:50:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "227wZw8jcM8", "description": "Remove Deck Boards - Duckbill Deck Wrecker - Review", "title": "Remove Deck Boards - Duckbill Deck Wrecker - Review", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T05:16:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "228Rr-Do7aA", "description": "Se inici\u00f3 el procedimiento en la regi\u00f3n abdominal por v\u00eda laparosc\u00f3pica, se colocan 4 puertos de 5mm, el primero bajo visi\u00f3n directa en la cicatriz umbilical utilizando \u00f3ptica de 5mm con c\u00e1mara de 30\u00b0 los otros 3 puertos en FID, hipocondrio derecho e hipocondrio izquierdo; se inicia neumoperitoneo con un flujo de 2l/min, con presi\u00f3n de 12mmHg.
