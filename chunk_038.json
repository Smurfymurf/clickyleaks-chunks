It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type\n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\nGlobally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES:\n\nThis type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nThe several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nDipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more details - \n\n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n     Nadipathy Centres \n\n1.

These spices scream out flavor and a bit of heat used in the right amounts.  I'll show how to sear off the chicken to make sure it's flavorful, tender and juicy.

As I now have an interest in 'Lamp work' (bead making) I thought I'd modify the kiln door to make it more suitable for bead annealing.\n\nWhile I was making this video I opened the door too many times and upset the PID controller which, in normal use, is a very stable control device and that is why the element was a bit hotter that it would normally be for annealing glass. (operator error) \n\nI give a technical specification at the end of the video but here it is below if you want to copy it.\n\nTechnical specification. \nThe modified door is sometimes called a 'guillotine door' because of the up/down action but the principal feature of the door is that it keeps the hot face of the door away from the operator so it's sometimes referred to as a cold face opening door.\n\n Case dimensions excluding handle and terminal box at the back:-\nWidth 320 mm   Height 200 mm   Length (back to front) 400 mm \nThe case is all aluminium..\n\nCavity:-  Width 220 mm  Height 100 mm  Length 300 mm  \n\nInsulation:- 50 mm Kaowool ceramic blanket on all six sides (two layers of 25 mm)\n\nPower 1.29 kW        Voltage 220 AC\n\nNormal maximum working temperature 850 \u00b0C    (1,560\u00b0F)\n     \nThe working temperature is only limited by the element. \nThe element is formed from a one metre long sheathed element I just happened to have I think it's a regular stainless steel element.\n\nCharacteristics:-\n\nTime to heat form 17 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C at full power around 6 minutes (with nothing in the kiln.)\n\n\nTemperature is controlled via a Stafford Instrument's ST222 plug in PID programmable controller with up to 9 programs each with up to 9 segments.\n \nFull details at www.staffordinstruments.co.uk \n\nNote at the beginning of the video you'll see the element is at the bottom of the kiln but when I changed the door I also moved the element to the top of the kiln. \n\nThanks for watching.\n\nKind Regards ...

This dance is performed to purify the ground and to chase away evil influences and is performed during the Tibetan religious ceremony.\n\nThe Black Hat dancers assume the appearance of yogis who have the power of killing and recreating life. In order to lead to the field of Buddha beings who cannot be led by peaceful means, they subdue these enemies of the Doctrine through their external compassionate anger but internally they have an accomplished peaceful mind. They have the appearance of Tantrists who are good to beings through terrifying but really accomplished acts such as killing and expelling bad spirits. By the wisdom of their knowledge, the five poisonous sins disappeared in the sphere of emptiness.\n\nThis dance can also be referred to as 'Gar' dance. It is derived from the different traditions of the Tantras (texts of Northern buddhism). They say that with the help of gods who have meditated deeply upon the mantras (sacred formulas), the 'Gar' which are the gestures of the dancers' hands are transformed into mudras (sacred mystic gestures) and their feet which pound the earth are forming a mandala (mystic geometric figure).\n\nThe Black Hat Dancers who perform the ritual for the earth firstly build a tantric mandala and then cut the demons into pieces. Thus, they take possession of the earth in order to further protect it and they dance the thunderbolt step to impress their power on it (The thunderbolt step is a particular step in the religious dances).\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Hab\u00eda llovido, y el polvillo del volc\u00e1n se convirti\u00f3 en una especie de cemento blando en el que se marcaron las huellas de varios animales, incluidos esos tres hom\u00ednidos. 'Un individuo grande, probablemente macho, se dirig\u00eda lentamente hacia el norte. Tras \u00e9l parti\u00f3 un individuo menor que, por alguna raz\u00f3n, anduvo sobre las pisadas del primer individuo. Otro m\u00e1s joven saltaba a su lado, y en un punto se volvi\u00f3 para mirar a su izquierda. El sol coci\u00f3 muy pronto las huellas y las convirti\u00f3 en impresiones en roca dura.\"  As\u00ed reconstruye aquel instante de la larga historia de los ancestros del hombre Richard Leakey, el hijo de Mary Leakey, la mujer que en 1976 descubri\u00f3 el rastro de Laetoli.\nEl rastro conservado tiene medio centenar de metros, y los numerosos estudios que se han hecho de esas pisadas han dado mucha informaci\u00f3n (incluso hay cient\u00edficos que opinan que s\u00f3lo caminaron dos seres). Un individuo, el grande, medir\u00eda unos 140 cent\u00edmetros; el peque\u00f1o, 120. Lo m\u00e1s importante es que aquellos hom\u00ednidos ya caminaban como nosotros (y ning\u00fan otro primate actual lo hace). No es el cerebro, como muchos prefer\u00edan, ni siquiera la utilizaci\u00f3n diestra de las manos lo que marca la diferencia entre humanos y monos. Es el caminar erguido sobre las extremidades inferiores el principal rasgo distintivo que los paleont\u00f3logos actuales buscan en los f\u00f3siles para incluir a un primate en la familia de los hom\u00ednidos o dejarlo fuera, en el grupo de los monos. Y el rastro en las cenizas del volc\u00e1n Sadim\u00e1n fue y sigue siendo un hito.

As many as 60 men at a time were held in small space, separated from their families.\n \nUgandan-born curator Julian Kiganda cannot imagine what it was like for them, to know they might never see their loved ones again.\n\n\"Seeing that African-Americans had experienced on a regular basis, the separation of family. That for me was just so heartbreaking.\" \n\nMost of the slaves had worked on local plantations picking tobacco. When the soil was exhausted, they were sold to plantations further south to pick cotton, says Audrey Davis, head of Alexandria's Black History Museum.  \n\n\"They were coming from a variety of places, and then being held in the slave pens until they were shipped out, or until someone was buying them directly from the pen, and then they would be brought out for inspection.\" \n\nThe slave pen took up an entire block, and was one of the most lucrative in the country. There was a kitchen, infirmary, dining area and an outdoor courtyard for exercise. The traders knew that healthier looking slaves would command higher prices, and even gave them new clothes.\n\n\"The tailor shop would create the clothes that the slaves would wear at the market so they would look expensive. The slaves, they would actually try to get rid of these clothes as soon as they could because they did not want to be reminded of being sold at market like property.\"\n\nThe slaves were sold for up to four times what the traders had paid for them.\n\n\"People would pay $1,200 for a slave, back in those days, which is the equivalent of almost $30,000 in today's money.\" \n\nThe metal door in the museum is a copy. But the bars on the windows and brick walls are original.\n\nJacquelyn Nordorf, visiting from California, says it is chilling to imagine slaves crowded against these walls.\n\n\"It saddens me but it is our history. It was scary to be in a place where the slaves were actually kept and these people were sold for their lives.\"\n\nWhen they were transported, the slaves were shackled together to prevent escape and put on ships, or forced to walk long distances to plantations in the south.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitors are encouraged to touch these slave chains.\n\n\"We felt it was important for people to have the ability to actually feel these things and feel the reality of what happened here.\" \n\nSome people feel the presence of spirits here. The house now belongs to the Northern Virginia chapter of the Urban League -- an organization that empowers African-Americans.  Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Dinkins and her staff say they have heard and seen things they can't explain.\n\n\"I felt something brush against me, but I didn't feel threatened at all. And they are like Oh no! Yes, yes, we've experienced things like that, doors opening and closing, footsteps.\"\n\nThe slave pen was closed during the American civil war, fought between the northern Union and southern Confederacy, where slavery supported the economy. After Southern-backed Alexandria surrendered to Union soldiers in 1861, the pen was turned into a prison. It was used to jail unruly Union soldiers, and ironically, Confederate soldiers, who found themselves captured and held as the slaves had been.", "title": "1210) The Museum of Slavery in Virginia", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T19:21:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1LwPssnNqnU", "description": "Richland Township Supervisor Bob Heffelfinger urges for Prevailing Wage reform in Pennsylvania.", "title": "Current Prevailing Wage Greatly Affects Municipalities", "publishedDate": "2013-09-17T15:13:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1LxH7MtqMOQ", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton discusses Republicans' argument against President Barack Obama in 2012 National Democratic Convention speech.\n\n\"In Tampa, the Republican argument against the President's re-election was actually pretty simple, pretty snappy.

For example, to write 82% as a decimal, think of 82% as 82/100, and remember that dividing by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the left, to get 0.82. So 82% can be written as the decimal 0.82. Since a percent can be written as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left, a decimal can be written as a percent by moving the decimal point two places to the right. For example, to write 0.4 as a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right to get 40.

Meanwhile, his royal advisor, embodying the form of many Disney villains before him, frees Diablo from his rusty, weakened fail-box and allows possession of the lard king.\n\nThe lard king, suffering from clogged arteries and demon infection, executes a bunch of people, while his son is swallowed away to also be possessed by the lord of terror. Other general madness ensues... the advisor has an extreme lapse in judgment and leads the entire town to their death in the catacombs.\n\nThe pillow king is defeated by the captain of his army only to return as the Skeleton King because.. why not? And now you, gentle tortured soul wishing to avenge your family, hit the scene and have so much excitement and enjoyment before you that you can barely contain yourself. \n\nHave fun.\n\n---\n\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\nWant more from Polaris?\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4", "title": "LORE - Diablo Lore in a Minute!", "publishedDate": "2011-08-08T18:06:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M908L-cZwg", "description": "ERNESTINE ROMERO - DESESPERADA\nTEJANO ELITE RADIO\n\n\n\nwww.tejanoeliteradio.com", "title": "ERNESTINE ROMERO - DESESPERADA  [[[TEJANO ELITE]]]", "publishedDate": "2009-11-08T14:50:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M98ZXfHA9E", "description": "OzonoCrew", "title": "Lonas - Change the level", "publishedDate": "2012-09-10T19:41:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M9KIWXicN0", "description": "Music video by Christophe Willem;Christophe Willem En Duo Avec Zaho performing Ind\u00e9l\u00e9bile (audio). 2013 SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINEMENT", "title": "Christophe Willem en Duo Avec Zaho - Ind\u00e9l\u00e9bile (audio)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T04:32:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M9NZ2q-MtI", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "SUPping with Dolphins & Avalon Stand Up Paddle", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T20:57:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M9fLbqjHpo", "description": "Travis James and Cayden Ross enjoy a little down time at the Randy Blue Studios", "title": "Cayden & Travis goofing around", "publishedDate": "2011-03-11T21:03:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M9hf0Gh4zE", "description": "", "title": "new magic trick with four card!!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T13:44:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1M9oK1a9wBI", "description": "pestovv cover metallica enter sandman", "title": "pestovv cover metallica enter sandman", "publishedDate": "2007-09-20T16:58:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MA135a5ToM", "description": "Comores : beramu hymne national comorien archipel mayotte anjouan moheli grande comore", "title": "COMORES HYMNE NATIONAL / COMOROS ANTHEM / JIMBO LA TAIFA", "publishedDate": "2011-04-16T12:55:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MAngjlaVnM", "description": "For better sound please watch in 240 p. quality.

What is it? Let's try to understand.       A gyroscope was invented already in the early 19th century by Johann Bohnenberger, and a well-known philosopher and scientist Foucault first used it as an instrument showing change of the direction of the Earth. And it was he who introduced the term.       However, the gyroscopic effect in itself is not something invented. It exists objectively as a law of physics. An example of its action is the usual children's top, which rotates around its axis and does not fall, maintaining an upright position.       At the floor bearing point of the top there is a force, under the action of which the axis of its rotation deviates from the vertical. The centrifugal force of the rotating mass prevents changing the plane of the rotation and forces the top to maintain the given orientation in space during the motion.       Now the gyroscope is a device that allows maintaining directional stability of the body in space during its motion. In modern industry gyroscopes are used in instruments of navigation to maintain the heading. It is also used during the design of real helicopters, planes, rockets, and submarines.       When it is used in radio controlled helicopters, the gyroscope provides substantial advantage. For example, during the flight the helicopter's tail may be swung to some side. The gyroscope detects this deviation and gives signals to the propeller motors to resist this deviation. Therefore, the helicopter doesn't spin around its axis, and maintains the heading.       The new radio controlled helicopters use small piezoelectric sensors, 5 times smaller than a penny coin. Thanks to them, the flight of the model is easy to control, it becomes balanced. Fans of radio controlled models know how difficult it is to fly small helicopters. Compared to the real helicopters hovering freely in the sky, the models are swung and turned, and soft landing is only a dream in the beginning.       Helicopters with a gyroscope, due to the stability of the flight, allow learning to pilot them without hassle and fear to break the toy. You have full control over the process; your model is most obedient. In addition, the case and nylon blades of GYRO helicopters are very firm.", "title": "Why a helicopter needs a gyroscope", "publishedDate": "2012-06-15T23:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MHiPoej-ms", "description": "The reflection of the sun and sky on this Floridian stream reminds me of the transporter room on Star Trek when characters were \"beamed up\" or \"down to the surface\"", "title": "The Star Trek Effect In Florida Near A Stream By The Forest", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T22:14:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MHiVHhZWcE", "description": "Emil Stabil - Det G\u00e5r Ned", "title": "Emil Stabil - Det G\u00e5r Ned", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T18:03:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MHq0O7kaDI", "description": "FOLLOW US:  https://twitter.com/OUTTA_FOCUS\n\nFAN US:  http://www.facebook.com/LowRentEntertainment\n\nYOU LAZY NEGROES NEED TO GET OFF WELFARE is a video explaining that all you shiftless negroes need to get off the welfare gravy train.

He was pronounced dead at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena at 3:24 a.m. Wednesday.\n   The murder charge against Martinez includes a special circumstance allegation of murder of a police officer. The criminal complaint also includes gun and gang allegations.\n   Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Diamond was helping to open the outer door of a home in the 100 block of San Marino Avenue as part of a multi-agency operation targeting the Mongols gang when an interior door of the home was opened and a single shotgun blast rang out.\n   Police did not return fire.\n   ``The officers at this point didn't have a clear shot at the suspect,'' said sheriff's Lt. Eddie Hernandez. ``The suspect, we're being told, laid on the ground and put the firearm to his side. Also the (suspect's) father was in the way, and at that point it became a rescue operation to get the officer some medical attention. The suspect was taken into custody without incident.''\n   Sheriff's officials said Martinez has a criminal history that includes assault with a deadly weapon and domestic violence.\n   Diamond had 16 years of experience in law enforcement. He worked with the Los Angeles Police Department from 1995-2002, then with the Montebello Police Department from 2002-03. He joined the Pomona Police Department in 2006 and its SWAT team two years later.\n   Diamond is survived by his wife, a son, daughter, mother, father, sister and brother.\n   A prayer vigil will be held in Diamond's memory at 6:30 p.m. at Mission Boulevard and Park Avenue in Pomona.\n   Martinez was jailed under ``risk precaution'' procedures requiring him to be checked every 15 minutes, said Nicole Nishida, a sheriff's spokeswoman. He was not on suicide watch, she said.\n   Martinez claimed in court that he was jailed without clothing or food.

The military agenda, the traditional security agenda, dropped down in salience very greatly and various other sorts of things emerged and got more prominence. There were a lot of talk about societal security, identity, nationalism, religion and all of those kinds of things. There were more talks about economic and environmental security. So during the 90s, there was a considerable broadening out of the agenda - which had been visible before - a move away from security as being principally about military things, and a move towards accepting a wider range of things as being part of what the security discourse was about.\n\nThere are, of course, some people who think that security is just military and that the two things define each other. Im not a fan of that position because it seems to me that the military isnt intrinsically about security issues. My sense of a security issue is that it goes along with a certain kind of formula, that there has to be an existential threat, a big threat to something - a referent object which is highly valued by a group of people - and that that combination of things leads to call for extreme measures, or emergency measures of some sort. That to me is the kind of formula for identifying whats a security issue and whats not. In other words, its an attempt to take things out of the realm of normal politics and attach to them an emergency type of priority, saying we have to do something about this, and we have to do it now and quickly because if we dont, something we value, maybe us, is going to disappear or be seriously damaged in some way. That to me is what differentiates security politics from normal politics. And it could be military stuff, but it could not.\n\nIf you think of security in that way, then aspects of military stuff arent security. The fact that the Danes sent peacekeepers to Bosnia, or wherever, isnt a security issue for Denmark. Its normal politics. Its part of their foreign policy. I think its important to break the link between the military and the security agenda, and to look at it instead in terms of this formula that Ive set out. My colleague Ole Waever calls it panic politics.

How much butane do you use? A. I utilize 1 can of high quality butane per oz of high quality trim/flower. \nQ. What tubes do you use? A. Extraction Experts XL Tubes. Good tubes, company always ships super slow though. I'll be moving to new tubes soon.\nQ. What kind of filters? I use 100 micron metal screens in conjunction with 25 micron pressing screens, as well as unbleached coffee filters at times although I much prefer pressing screens as they hold up better for longer.\nQ. How long do you vacuum purge for? A. Till I've reached the desired honeycomb texture I want, or till I have a clean shatter that will not move under pressure at 110f. \nQ. Do I really need a vacuum pump and chamber for making good oil? A. It is not 100% necessary, but I HIGHLY recommend it for top shelf oil. It will make your job a lot faster and easier, and help to ensure you a safer product. \nQ. What kind of pump do you use? A. Robinair 2 Stage 3 CFM Pumps.\nQ. What kind of butane do you use?  A. I mostly use Power 5x, but also like Vector and Colibri (twice the price).\nQ. What kind of vacuum chamber do you use, and where can I buy one?  A. Vac-It Pro and you can only purchse them on eBay.  They are around $120.\nQ. Do you constantly run the vacuum pump?  A.

Womens lip plugs typically range between 2cm - 3cm to more than 8cm, usually depending on the age of the wearer (the older the wearer, the larger the lip plugs).  Lips are pierced in early childhood (5 to 8 years old).  The openings are stretched over time with the introduction of larger and larger plugs.  Lip plugs are worn at all times, even while eating, drinking and sleeping.  Many Mousgoum women also pierce and stretch both ear lobes as well as one nostril.  On rare occasions Mousgoum women may wear as many as six lip plugs: two large central plugs a long with four smaller plugs inserted on the top and bottom of the sides of the mouth.  Some women also employ extensive facial and body scarification to complete their ensemble.  Many prefer to only wear plugs and G-strings, in lieu of clothing.

On August 30, 1954, he was tonsured as a monk, and took the name Peter. On September 4 and 5, 1954, he was ordained hierodeacon and hieromonk by Archbishop Boris, Exarch of the Russian Patriarchate in Europe. In 1960, Peter was elevated to the rank of archimandrite.\nOn September 12, 1968, Archimandrite Peter was consecrated Bishop of Chersonese (Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe). In 1979, Bishop Peter was invited to serve in the Orthodox Church in America by Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor). Bishop Peter accepted, and was installed as Bishop of Brooklyn that year. Two years later, he succeeded Metropolitan Theodosius as Bishop of New York and New Jersey. In 1990, Bishop Peter was elevated to the rank of archbishop.\nThe author of several books, Archbishop Peter's final volume spurred some disagreements in Orthodox circles. Published by St. Vladimir's Press, it urged the Orthodox Churches to adopt the Western Christian calculation of Easter, aka Paschalion. This has been a controversial topic for some time in Eastern Orthodox discourse. Some critics of the book emphasized that only the Eastern Paschalion holds to the Nicene Council's 4th century prohibition on celebrating the Resurrection before the Jewish Passover. Some argued that abandonment of that stipulation could even imply a subtle subtext of antisemitism, since it would further decouple the connection between Christianity and Judaism. This criticism is made on both historical and contemporary grounds, the latter because Western Christianity annually ignores contemporary Jews' calculation of Passover.\nSubsequent to Abp. Peter's retirement from the episcopate in 2005, the Diocese of New York and New Jersey was combined with the Diocese of Washington (D.C.) to create the Diocese of Washington and New York.\nBoth during his episcopate and subsequent to his retirement, Abp. Peter taught canon law at Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary.\nThe Archbishop died in Bronxville, New York on November 19, 2007. He was buried at St. Tikhon's Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania.", "title": "Memorial service for Archbishop Peter of New York", "publishedDate": "2012-11-18T18:37:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1MuWOGoQJuI", "description": "Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo (Maria Vittoria Carlotta Enrichetta; 9 August 1847 -- 8 November 1876) was an Italian noblewoman and was the Princess della Cisterna in her own right.

Chances are they used a logical fallacy. http://infactvideo.com\n\nIn this first of three videos, we're going to look at some common fallacious arguments; ways that people make their points sounds convincing even when they're not true. A common one is:\n\nThe Ad Hominem\n\nArguing against the person rather than against the argument. Let's say some guy is trying to convince you that Einstein's theory of relativity is wrong:\n\nEinstein? That guy married his cousin. How can you trust his calculations?\n\nFlip it around and you have:\n\nThe Bandwagon Fallacy\n\nWhich tries to claim that something must be true because so many people believe it:\n\n50 million people have read The Secret. That many people can't be wrong.\n\nOh yes they can. How about the people whose religious or political beliefs are different from yours? That's a lot more than 50 million right there.\n\nYou can also use:\n\nThe Argument from Antiquity\n\nTo prove that something must be true because people have believed it for a long time.\n\nChinese medicine's been around for 5,000 years. It wouldn't have lasted that long if it didn't work.\n\nBeing ancient only proves that an idea comes from prescientific times. Maybe it works, like the wheel; maybe it doesn't, like burning witches (some more great ancient wisdom).\n\nA related tactic is to pull out\n\nThe All-Natural Fallacy\n\nThis is a way to sell a product by raising the specter of concern about competing products that might be... \"tarnished\" by modern knowledge.\n\nYou should sprinkle some of this Haitian zombie powder in your wound. Ground human bones, hemlock, stinging nettle, pufferfish neurotoxin... it's all natural.\n\nThe Argument from Authority\n\nIgnores the need to have good information and instead relies on an authority figure.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your research shows; my information came from a scientist. So it can't be wrong!\n\nBut if all else fails, fall back on:\n\nThe Appeal to Quantum Physics\n\nThis is why people think Deepak Chopra knows anything; he throws around terms like this to make whatever he says sound scientific and advanced.\n\nQuantum physics links our metaphysical beings through quantum entanglement.\n\nHey it sounded over my head; he must know what he's talking about.\n\nNext time we'll look at some ways that language itself can be misused to accomplish the same thing.", "title": "inFact: Logical Fallacies 1", "publishedDate": "2011-06-30T19:59:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1N3YZUiYkhA", "description": "Wesley Safad\u00e3o e Garota Safada 2014 - Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Vai Conhecer Algu\u00e9m Melhor Que Ela", "title": "Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Vai Conhecer Algu\u00e9m Melhor Que Ela - Wesley Safad\u00e3o e Garota Safada", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T22:49:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1N4oUAwR_Og", "description": "More info about travel to Vienna: http://www.ricksteves.com/europe/austria/vienna In this video, we'll tour the Hofburg Palace\u2019s \u201cTreasure Room,\u201d which contains the best jewels on the Continent.

Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter).\n\nRed-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown.

A REIA is a real estate investment association. A group formed for the continuing education and networking benefit of its Club members.\n\nReal Estate Investment Associations meet regularly all over the country. They hold there meetings usually on monthly basis in the evening. Guests can usually come free to a first meeting or pay thereafter a meeting by meeting charge. Membership is encouraged as these organizations are primarily funded through membership. Whether you are a new or seasoned investor, membership in your local association is a priority. There is old saying it's never too late to learn something new. These meetings are full of valuable real estate investing information. Learn from those who have been in the \"investor land mine fields\". Having a place and a setting for putting your dream team together through the networking, which is priceless? How many times have you heard, \"It's not who you are, but who you know that makes you successful?\" The people you meet at these meeting will move you to a whole new level of results by cutting through the red tape of investing. You can not believe what you get in value from the membership investment. It's like having Mark Twain as your personal coach for one year of training on writing a success book and all you pay him is $150 to $200 dollars.\n\nIndividual members benefit from meeting both new and seasoned investors. What great places where newer investors go to learn and work for seasoned investors, finding them deals and getting paid while learning. That's right, they make money, learn the business without risking their own dollars or credit. Being Wholesaler of real estate is sometimes call being bird dog for the seasoned investors. Growing up I always heard the term \"that dog don't hunt\". This holds does not hold true in the real estate investing club business. Here the meaning is \"this does dog hunt\". The new investor will learn as they earn free from risk and pressure. They have the experienced investor along as your coach and mentor.\n\nThere are resources tables at the investor meetings where every one brings their fliers and business cards. What great way for group to get to know each other and promote different recourses like Investor Real Estate Agents, Investor's Mortgage Loan Officers, Real Estate Attorneys, And Real Estate Minded CPAs, Accountants, Property Managers, Contractors, Title Companies, and Wholesalers? Real Estate Business Suppliers with products or services for the real estate investor seeking repeat business can network at their local REIA to meet potential customers. Like minded people working together can move mountains.\n\nThese REIAs and Landlord Clubs invite national and local speakers and experts to teach their members new and innovative techniques that when applied, will bring success. A lot of National Speakers have investing courses, boot camps and home study courses for sale to the attendees. The club leaders work on reviewing these course and reputations before inviting speakers to the events. Some of the REIAs provide forms disk for their members. It is always advised that members check with their own attorneys before using.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Successful Real Estate Investor Association (REIA) or Landlord Associations:\n\u2022 Owners or board members invest in real estate in the market that club is located. Many of the most successful REIAs have expert real estate board members or owners.\n\u2022 They provide a good mix of local and national expert speakers\n\u2022 They have an online presence -- they provide resources and information their members can access -- like forms, seminars, and up coming event calendar, list of real estate terms and what they mean\n\u2022 Meetings are held regularly (at least monthly). Many of most successful groups have more than one meeting a month\n\u2022 Speakers give great value -- they give more than promised\n\u2022 Membership includes benefits -- forms disk, access to recordings of local speakers\n\u2022 Opportunities to network with like minded people\n\u2022 Local REIA to be member National Associations for investor club to gain advise and coaching.\n\nHow to find a Real estate investors association in your area may be done by going to National Real Estate Network LLC web site http://www.MegaEveningEvent.com on the home page look in the lower left hand side for a list of real estate clubs through the country or you can also visit www.NationalREIA.com", "title": "Michigan Landlords   248-762-0800", "publishedDate": "2013-02-03T22:50:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NIV4ynbD5c", "description": "", "title": "Comment inverser Effet M\u00e9moire Batteries au nickel-cadmium", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T19:01:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NIxWfjw4OE", "description": "", "title": "BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN-BRAHMAN", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T16:48:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NJ1YKOgR34", "description": "Gul Panra New Album Songs 2014 -

In beating a brave Red Cadeaux and Who Shot Thebarman, Protectionist delivered the first Melbourne Cup win for Germany. He becomes the fifth northern hemisphere-trained horse to win the race since Vintage Crop scored in 1993. Protectionist is trained by Andreas Wohler and was ridden by Ryan Moore, the English jockey who won the Cox Plate on Irish galloper Adelaide. \"He's won very easy, that's a very good horse,\" Moore said. \"Obviously it's very special.\" Starting with Japanese stayer Admire Rakti's win in the Caulfield Cup, the Melbourne spring carnival has belonged to the internationals. But Protectionist's win has ensured there is cause for Australian celebration after the nation's greatest horse race. The five-year-old is part-owned by Australian Bloodstock, the syndicator which raced the 2011 Melbourne Cup placegetter Lucas Cranach. Red Cadeaux, lining up in his fourth Melbourne Cup, became the first horse to run second three times after also finishing runner-up in 2011 and 2013. \n\nTAGS\n\nProtectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, Protectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, Protectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, Protectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, Protectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news, us news and world report magazine, Protectionist,wins,Melbourne Cup,completing,international clean sweep,Australia's richest spring races,beating,brave Red Cadeaux,Thebarman,Who Shot Thebarman,Germany,Andreas Wohler,Ryan Moore,Irish galloper Adelaide,English jockey,Caulfield Cup,placegetter Lucas Cranach,Signoff,Australian-trained horse,abc breaking news,bbc,bbc football,bbc iplayer,bbc news,bbc news america,bbc persian,bbc sport,bbc weather,bbc world news,breaking election news,breaking late news,breaking local news,breaking music news,breaking news", "title": "Protectionist wins the Melbourne Cup", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T10:29:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NN3o5oVvGk", "description": "Dans la nuit de mardi 21 \u00e0 mercredi 22 juin, la Parlement grec a renouvell\u00e9 par un vote sa confiance au gouvernement de Georges Papandr\u00e9ou.

The science behind skunk smell is very interesting; from the striped skunk's natural history to the chemical make-up of this foul-smelling defense mechanism. \n\nWe are all very familiar with the smell left behind after a skunk has sprayed its odiferous scent.  The science behind skunk smell is very interesting; from the striped skunk's natural history to the chemical make-up of this foul-smelling defense mechanism. \n\nThe striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) is distinctive because of the bold markings that run down the length of its body.  This type of colouration is a great example of aposematism; a warning signal for potential predators.  For most predators, this signal is warning enough.  For others who perhaps have not encountered a skunk in the past, may continue to bother the striped mammal.  When mortally threatened, they bend into a U-shape with both their head and rump facing the enemy.  They then emit two streams of fluid from scent glands located just inside the anus, which turn into a fine spray that can travel up to 2 or 3 metres.  The spray often burns the eyes and nasal cavities and can cause nausea.  It is because of their offensive odour that skunks are rarely preyed upon by other mammals, but instead are eaten by large predatory birds like owls and hawks. \n\nContained within that stinky scent is a combination of chemicals, mostly sulfur-containing compounds called thiols and thioacetates.  Not surprisingly, thiols are also found in other smelly materials, like rotting flesh and feces.  The skunk spray itself is in the form of oil which will cling to most surfaces that it contacts.  If that surface happens to be an unfortunate pet, the thiols will bind strongly and rapidly to skin proteins.  This scent will stick around until the thiols break down naturally, which could take several weeks.  And if the animal becomes wet, the smell is even more pungent because the thioacetate is readily converted to the smellier thiol when mixed with water. \n\nIn order to neutralize the odour both the chemical structure of the volatile compounds and the oil need to be broken down.  Unfortunately, tomato juice just does not work to do this; it just makes a big mess!  A simple home remedy is to mix hydrogen peroxide (3%) with baking soda and add a little dish detergent.  Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda act as oxidizing agents, changing the chemical structure of the thiols into odourless sulfonic acid compounds.  The dish detergent helps to cut the oil so that the by-products of the initial chemical reaction can be washed away.  The most common combination of these ingredients is 3-4 parts hydrogen peroxide, 1 part baking soda and a teaspoon of dish detergent.  To be most effective, this solution must be used immediately after mixing while it is still bubbling and should be applied directly to the affected areas.\n\nIn the video, I use a more concentrated hydrogen peroxide (30%) to show how reactive it is.  This chemical reaction is often referred to as \"elephant's toothpaste\" because the resulting foam looks like toothpaste big enough for an elephant!  I mix hydrogen peroxide with dish soap and then add sodium iodide, a catalyst that drives the reaction.  You can try this reaction at home with some household ingredients.  The reaction won't happen as quickly as the one in the video but it will still be impressive.  Measure out 100 mL of hydrogen peroxide (3%), add \u00bd teaspoon of dish soap and then add 1 teaspoon of bread yeast.  Try varying the amounts of materials to see if the reaction changes!\n\nFor More Information Visit http://sciencenorth.ca/thunderbay", "title": "Cool Science De-Stinking Skunks Mar25", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T20:40:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NSP3RjAsy4", "description": "", "title": "Lomariopsidaceae Pt1", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T22:16:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NScOKbPLdo", "description": "Suburban Men - http://suburbanmen.com\n\nIn this video from Black Gold on Tru TV, a huge guy is talking to a smaller guy then sucker punches him with a left hook.

Now you can create spider webbing that will make all the spiders in your neighborhood really really jealous, (which may not be a good thing if you sleep with a window open).\n\nThe Webcaster Gun comes with 5 Webcaster Sticks. You'll need to supply an air compressor that generates at least 90psi. Worried about running out of webbing? Don't be, you can use common ordinary hot glue sticks with the Webcaster Gun! Tell us that ain't cool. Go on, we dare you.\n\nNot intended for children, not a toy. Please use this product judiciously as webbing may leave a stain on certain materials -- test on a small area before you coat the walls, ok? \n\nCreate super realistic spider webs! Connect to any air compressor and insert the Webcaster Sticks. In minutes you'll have an amazing scene! 4 CFM recommeded, but less pressure allows for more intricate detailing.\n\nFind us on E-Bay, Facebook, and on our website LordGrimley.com\nhttp://stores.ebay.com/Lord-Grimleys-Manor\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LordGrimleysManor\nhttp://www.lordgrimley.com/", "title": "Professional Webcaster Gun : Instant Cobweb Creation for Halloween Haunts", "publishedDate": "2013-09-17T21:33:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NXLZsKdhwA", "description": "8 year old John John Florence featured on a vintage episode of Bpard Stories.", "title": "BSTV V4#03 John John Florence Grom segment", "publishedDate": "2013-09-05T03:16:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NXYJSuZu7w", "description": "\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05ea \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4,\u05d4\u05e7\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4,\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d3\u05d0\u05d5,\u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\n\u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0\n\u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8 2009\n\u05de\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc, \u05de\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05da \u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc", "title": "Simchat Torah - \u05de\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc, \u05de\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05da \u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc", "publishedDate": "2009-10-11T16:55:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NXgxMWjzfA", "description": "Lezione di Chirurgia Plastica eseguite dalla dr.ssa Caldarella nell'ambito del percorso formativo della scuola di specializzazione in Chirurgia Plastica, Ricostruttiva ed Estetica, sotto la direzione del Prof. Mario Dini", "title": "Ricostruzione palpebra inferiore Prof Dini", "publishedDate": "2012-08-02T21:06:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NXmuBLFLCA", "description": "", "title": "Loyalist Songs - UDA All the Way", "publishedDate": "2011-09-15T21:10:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NYbdS30baQ", "description": "Fiddler's Green with The More The Merrier @ Lowlands 2014", "title": "Fiddler's Green - The More The Merrier - Lowlands 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T13:12:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NYmZh-WFWw", "description": "NBA 2K15 Face Scan: The worst NBA 2K15 face scan ever?

Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as the Moon.\nThe world's first artificial satellite, the Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Since then, thousands of satellites have been launched into orbit around the Earth. Some satellites, notably space stations, have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Artificial satellites originate from more than 50 countries and have used the satellite launching capabilities of ten nations. A few hundred satellites are currently operational, whereas thousands of unused satellites and satellite fragments orbit the Earth as space debris. A few space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun.\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.\nSatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.", "title": "Journey of a Satellite into Space", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T19:08:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NfuWQZTTmo", "description": "Video footage taken from a lecture by Dr. Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri explaining the permissibility of waseela and tawassul.\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PearlsOfMadina\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PearlsofMadina\n\nYOUR FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT TO US!\nfeedback@pearlsofmadina.com\n\nSEND YOUR VIDEOS TO US!\nshare@pearlsofmadina.com\n\nLook out for more videos soon...", "title": "Permissibility of Waseela and Tawassul | Dr. Tahir ul-Qadri |", "publishedDate": "2012-09-26T21:53:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NgDlMztnqU", "description": "The process of giving your flies insect-like characteristics and making it irresistible to fish is known as Hackling the flies.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\nGoats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and cardboard boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsing animals, not grazers like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans)\nAnother possibility is goats are curious about the unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes.\n\nFemale goats are referred to as \"does\" or \"nannies\", intact males as \"bucks\" or \"billies\", and their offspring are \"kids\". Castrated males are \"wethers\". Goat meat from younger animals is called \"kid\" or cabrito (Spanish), and from older animals is simply known as \"goat\" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas \"mutton\" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).\nAside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant. However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic. They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation. This is one reason goat-rearing is most often free ranging, since stall-fed goat-rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.\n\nGoats prefer to browse on vines, such as kudzu, on shrubbery and on weeds, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses. Nightshade is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats. Silage (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after opening - goats are particularly sensitive to Listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds. Alfalfa, a high-protein plant, is widely fed as hay; fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay. Mold in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it. Goats should not be fed grass showing any signs of mold.\n\nThe digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal. Milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.\nSources :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "title": "The domestic goat", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T17:42:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NtPDfVHlaI", "description": "iTunes Link: Coming Soon!\n\nOur iTunes page http://bit.ly/126qwFA\nFacebook page http://on.fb.me/19GEEim\nTwitter @JTMachinima\nWebsite http://www.jtmachinima.com\n\nGoogle Play http://bit.ly/1m7KvD1\nXbox Music http://bit.ly/1mPGCmt\nAmazon MP3 http://amzn.to/QS0706", "title": "Sunset Overdrive Rap by JT Machinima \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m in Overdrive\u201d", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T03:20:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NtWAbXxp6s", "description": "rock in rio - metallica (welcome home sanatarium 2) 2008", "title": "rock in rio - metallica (welcome home sanatarium 2) 2008", "publishedDate": "2008-06-07T10:26:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Ntg5hz-Zcw", "description": "ERNESTO CORTAZAR  - Autumn Rose\n Amazing piano music\nhttp://www.ernestocortazar.net\nVideo edited by Andreea Petcu(oceanflower1)\nhttp://www.yotube.com/Newoceanflower2008", "title": "\u2665ERNESTO CORTAZAR  - Autumn Rose\u2665", "publishedDate": "2008-11-15T18:59:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1NtgIk3AFNo", "description": "", "title": "playbox", "publishedDate": "2012-10-16T16:17:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Nu12cr3GoU", "description": "Norman & Hugo - Avoir du tact .

That's because the law is easy to break, and sadly dog \"cheats\" do.\n\nYou can't spot a service dog by vest or identification tag. Neither is required by law.\n\nIn fact, anyone can buy one online for a fee and no proof of certification is required.\n\nSo how can you tell the difference between a service dog and a fake?\n\nIt's the dog that becomes \"invisible\" when inside a business, restaurant or other establishment. They follow the commands of their owner, then lie quietly beneath a wheelchair or chair when not at work.\n\nWe were shown a video of two guide dogs in training inside a store that doesn't allow pets but by law welcomes service dogs.\n\nAt one point the two dogs are approached by a third larger dog on a retractable leash. The larger dog's unruly behavior makes it clear he is not a service dog, even though his owner has passed him off as one in order to enter the store. So what is the harm?\n\nThere is plenty, according to people with disabilities who fear for the safety of their highly trained helpers, and worry about potential backlash.\n\nBusiness owners are worried too about health violations and damage caused by imposters.\n\n\"You denigrate the entire opportunity for people who truly need service animals,\" says Wendy Crann, executive director of WAGS for Kids.\n\nWAGS stands for Working Animals Giving Service, and it's the only Ohio organization that exclusively places service dogs with children up to the age of 18.\n\n\"People don't take into consideration how long and how hard the fight was to have access for appropriately trained service animals. It wasn't an overnight thing,\" says Wendy.\n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act Requirements: Service Animals\n\nCrann is aware of websites selling vests, identification tags and so-called proof of training to anyone.\n\nTo this she says, \"Coats and IDs don't make service dogs. Training to a certainty of behavior -- that makes a service dog.\"\n\nWhat she does find troubling are sites that offer \"disability assessment tests.\"\n\nChannel 3's Monica Robins took the website's test to see if she would qualify for a service dog.\n\nAfter three easy questions the test determined Monica did indeed qualify for a service dog, based on a previous leg injury that has long since healed. She is not pursuing the suggestion.\n\nDisability Rights Ohio Fact Sheet on Service Animals\n\n\"It's a confirmation of a question of a disability that is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" says Crann. \"At WAGS for Kids we don't place dogs with kids that don't have a doctor's confirmation of a disability. That's step one. The second thing is training. Service animals are trained to what we call a certainty of behavior that they will do what you tell them to do when you tell them to do it. This is not about a well behaved dog that will lie at your feet. This is a feature of service work that is trained to a certainty of behavior.\"\n\nTraining can take up to two years, and costs can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nCommunity fundraising and donations are often used to help people afford the cost.\n\nThe law does allow for individuals to train their own dogs to be service dogs, but trainers say in order for that to work, they must also be matched with the appropriate dog.\n\nIt is a federal crime to use a \"fake\" service dog, but as we found enforcement is tough because of privacy laws built in to protect persons with disabilities.\n\nUnder the Americans With Disabilities Amendment Act of 2008, a business cannot require a person with a service animal to dislose what disability they have, provide proof of certification for the service dog or give a demonstration of the dog's ability.\n\nA business owner can ask two questions:\n\nIs this your service dog?\nWhat work or task has the animal been trained to perform?\nHowever, if the dog misbehaves, barks, jumps or soils the premises, the owner can ask for the dog to be removed. They must welcome the handler to return to the store but without the dog.", "title": "Fake Service Dogs Create Real Problems", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T21:38:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1O-CjGQA3uI", "description": "Provides links to videos on the topic of system frequency response", "title": "Frequency Response  - Index of Videos", "publishedDate": "2012-01-06T07:15:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "1O-KrIKqDu8", "description": "Did you notice the lack of spinning tetrahedra in the world?

And what's really important about this is that it helps you grow your money a lot faster, because you have the power of compounding working in your favor. So let me give you an example. You know, if I invest $100 and the first year I'm investing I earn 10% that means I earned $10 and now I have $110. But that next year I can earn interest on the original $100 and the $10 as well, and that's really what compounding means. And compounding really helps you accelerate the growth of your money; particularly you're investing for longer periods of time. When it comes to compounding you need to invest as early as possible because the number one thing that's on your side when it comes to compounding is time. The longer the time you have the further you can grow your money. Compounding also works in the other direction. If I owe money and I have a lot of debt and I'm paying interest, interest is accumulating and I may owe interest on that interest. So compounding can work in a negative fashion as well when I' dealing with consumer debt for example. So what do you want to do? Start saving and investing as soon as you possibly can. The earlier that you can start saving for a goal like retirement the better, uh, pay down debt sooner rather than later for the same reason. A lot of times people think that small differences, really won't add up and I hear this all the time. You know \"I can't really save for my future today but next year I'll get around to it.\" And the next thing you know 7 or 8 years go by and the person haven't started saving for retirement and they're missing out on that that power of compounding. And it really becomes harder to catch up. If there is one thing I want you to walk away from this section on compounding with, start today whatever it is, as it relates to your financial situation that you are trying to do, weather its saving for retirement or trying to pay down debt, doing it today allows compounding to work for you and make sure that time is on your side.", "title": "What Is Compounding? | Financial Terms", "publishedDate": "2011-09-20T16:38:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OBUIwKZFGo", "description": "Videographer Award\n\nDesigning and executing a sharp, clean graphic design style, JCIP brings the Salient story to life in this quick and lively animation treatment.\n\nAn animation video from JCIP augments and enhances a company's marketing and branding efforts by educating its audience on various product offerings and/or the company as a whole.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Octopus boiled to death in Sannakji Soup", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T19:54:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OGoNFzuEYg", "description": "This is the recipe I used and it was based on the recipe on this blog:\nhttp://www.runningwithspatulas.com/2012/03/chocolate-swiss-meringue-buttercream-cupcakes.html\n\nMy half recipe was enough to frost about 10 cupcakes.\n(this is a half recipe, whole recipe is on the blog in the link above)\n2 extra large eggs\n1/2 cup plus one tablespoon granulated white sugar\n1/2 tsp vanilla\n1 cup cool butter cut into 1 tbsp cubes (cold enough so that you can cut it into cubes, but not frozen solid cold)\n1/2 cup and 1/8 cup (just over half a cup) of chocolate chips, melted and cooled.\n\nFill a saucepan with water and heat on the stove on medium heat until the water starts to simmer, turn heat down to medium -low.\nPlace bowl on top of pot making sure the bottom of the bowl isn't touching the water.\nAdd the sugar and the egg white and start whisking immediately and constantly over the hot water on the stove.  Whisk until you no longer can feel any sugar between your fingers in the egg whites, this happens fairly quickly.  The egg white will be safe when they reach 140F (pretty much the same time the sugar will be dissolved).\n\n** I will get the question, \"what if I don't have a thermometer? \"  You basically need to heat the egg whites until they are hot. How hot?  Hot enough so that you still can put your fingers in it to test for the dissolved sugar, but can't leave them in there for long without feeling pain from the heat.  \n\nOnce the egg whites are hot enough and the sugar is dissolved take the bowl off the pot and continue beating with an electric mixer (stand or hand).  Beat the egg whites until they are thick and glossy with soft peaks.\nThe temperature of the bowl must not feel hot at all.  Generally by the time your egg whites get thick and glossy enough their temperature will have come down to room temp.  If you egg whites are still warm, they will melt the butter when you add it.\nThis process can take about 10 to 15 minutes.  This is not a fast frosting.\n\nNow add the butter one cube at a time, beating after each addition. Continue to beat until you get something smooth and satiny and looking like frosting. \nIf your mixture look curdled keep beating!  This part may take a while.  If it looks soupy and runny, put the bowl in the fridge for a few minutes and then try beating again. \n\nOnce you get frosting, slowly add the melted and COOLED chocolate. Hot melted chocolate will melt the butter in the frosting = runny frosting.  If you do this, chill it a bit and try again with the beating.\n\nYou should end up with some smooth, satiny, fluffy, creamy, wonderfully chocolaty frosting that pipes like a dream.\n\nFor some excellent troubleshooting tips and tricks, please go to this blog:\nhttp://sweetapolita.com/2011/04/swiss-meringue-buttercream-demystified/\nThey even tell you how to freeze and/or refrigerate it.", "title": "Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream Frosting (on pudding filled chocolate cupcakes)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-10T20:40:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OH1JidEUpY", "description": "Nd\u00ebrkoh\u00eb, gjat\u00eb or\u00ebve t\u00eb mbr\u00ebmjes policia e Kuk\u00ebsit ka shoq\u00ebruar n\u00eb ambjentet e saj dy zyrtar\u00eb t\u00eb bashkis\u00eb s\u00eb qytetit n\u00eb lidhje me incidentin e verifikuar n\u00eb stadium.", "title": "Ndalohen kryepolici i bashkis\u00eb dhe nj\u00eb jurist p\u00ebr dhun\u00ebn - Top Channel Albania - News - Lajme", "publishedDate": "2013-12-07T21:03:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OH7Xklu7OM", "description": "by request! i'm not familiar with the old hxh anime (i'm a relatively new fan)\n\nthis is a lovely song, i'm sad to hear the singer passed away :(  rest in peace Minako Honda", "title": "Hunter x Hunter (1999) - Kaze No Uta (piano cover)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-28T21:49:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OHZzoRaEvQ", "description": "Already sold on the idea of promoting your business through video channels, such as YouTube or a vlog (video blog)?

This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).\n\nclerks.,\"clerks. clip\",\"clerks. movie\",\"clerks.ii trailer\",\"brian ohalloran\",\"marilyn ghigliotti\",\"mitch cohen\",\"cash videos\",\"cat videos\",\"money videos\",\"independent comedies\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",\"indie classics\",\"late night comedies\",\"scott mosier\",\"kevin smith\",\"dating videos\",\"frustration videos\",\"jealousy videos\",\"loyalty videos\",\"convenience store videos\",\"dante hicks\",veronica,\"angry crowd at door\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++134586,/m/063r24,/m/0b8x1m,/m/0k6qpm", "title": "37 Cocks - Clerks.

This is not an attack upon Christians, so please don_t take this as offensive, it_s just a means of education and let people know what Jesus was truly sent with. Jesus is a Prophet of Islam, yet a God of Christianity. In Islam God is all Powerful, But in Christianity God was overpowered and crucified on the cross, how can the Almighty God be overpowered, these are just examples for people to think about, we are not forcing you to believe, just ponder and question. The Quran is the final testament, Muhammad is the final Messenger. Islam is the final religion, so no I dont Hate Islam. One God, One God only, He does not beget nor was he begotten, He is the GREATEST. And has no partners. (Holy Quran Ch 112)\nThe following is a video response to bball1989_s video _Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word_. \n_And they say: the Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a Son. Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing, whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall to ruins, that ye ascribe to the Beneficent a son, when it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should chose a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave._ (Qur_an 19:88-93).\nI point out the false reasoning in the poem, and give some good reasons (there are more) to not believe his point. This is just me discussing the video, and what is wrong about the argument, and worst statements of the poem. Be sure to share this video, and thank you very much for your time! Have a beautiful day!\nThe following content is protected by fair use under critique.\nI wrote this to try and promote a healthy discussion. These are my views and opinions, but that does not mean that you must agree. If you want to defend your views and beliefs please do, but please do it in such a way that will shine a light on your beliefs and not embarrass them. I struggled with whether I should even upload this video or not, but I prayed about it, and you obviously can see the outcome of that. One World, One Love, One God.\n(While I appreciate all the Bible quotes, you must respect my belief to question the absoluteness of quotations that have been translated from their original language and passed down from generation to generation by flawed men. If the Bible is truly God_s word, why are there different versions of the Bible? The original video claims we should be weary of religion because it has been corrupted by man, I am certainly not disagreeing with that aspect of it, just talking that idea even further to encourage reflection. )\nResponse to AmazingAtheist\nAnd Response to\n\nWhy I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word This video Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word was deep.\n\nWhy I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word\nThis is a confusing subject, but I think he is saying things are easier than what we make of it.\n\n\n\nThanks so much, and don_t forget to check me out on the links below!", "title": "Zakat ul Fitr Sheikh Assim al Hakeem.webm", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T20:31:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OYQ4Fm7UoU", "description": "Princess Peach gets captured when Mario tries to visit her.", "title": "Peach's Disappearance, Episode 1", "publishedDate": "2011-03-13T03:22:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OYifOfLPNM", "description": "The proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) or long-nosed monkey, is endemic to the south-east Asian island of Borneo. The locals calls it monyet belanda (\"Dutch monkey\"), or evenorang belanda (\"Dutchman\"), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and big noses.\nProboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart. Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 9--19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. One-male groups typically consist of three to 12 individuals, but can contain more. Serious aggression is uncommon among monkeys but minor aggression does commonly occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation their social status.\nProboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called \"female calls\" when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.\n\nFemales become sexually mature at five years old. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by sub-adults. Proboscis monkey may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting. Gestation usually last 166--200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant.

Fewer than one in 10 Americans believe the President is doing a great job on the economy, polling data from Ipsos shows, and about two-thirds of the population believes the economy is heading the wrong way. \n\nMany candidates from his own party have been wary of appearing with him during their election races because of his sagging popularity. \n\nIf the Democrats lose the Senate, it will likely see Mr Obama reduced to a lame duck President unable to push forward his own agenda. \n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "How Barack Obama's unpopularity is affecting the midterm election in 60 seconds", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T10:52:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1OwkmH4zAAs", "description": "Members of the real IRA/Oglaigh na hEireann staged a checkpoint on the outskirts of meigh in Co. armagh up to seven men in combat gear armed with AK47 assault rifles and a rocket launcher distributed leaflets calling on locals not to co-operate with the PSNI, gardai, MI5 or sinn fein they also sent out a warning to drug dealers and other anti-social elements that their actions will not be tolerated and that they will be eliminated from society by their local IRA brigades.", "title": "Real IRA Stage Checkpoint In South Armagh", "publishedDate": "2012-10-30T21:00:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Owu1WU7DTY", "description": "One of the many moving stories is Joan Winch's childhood recollection of having to win a running race twice because she was a First Australian.\n\nJoan Winch': You see this?

I'd won!' and as I looked around behind me I could see them lining up again. I said, 'Hang on, they're lining up again.' So I rushed back and got in the line again and won the race!

When no female gorillas could be found in the area to step into the motherly role,  the Cincinnati Zoo  took over. \n\nThe zoo plans on utilizing human parents to train, nurture and socialize the baby gorilla so it will eventually be able to adapt to an animal family. A team of 7-10 surrogates will be with the gorilla 24/7, working in 8-hour shifts for the next few months. \n\nThe human team is expected to mimic gorilla sounds and wear fuzzy black vests while holding the infant. They will also teach it typical ape behavior. After 4 or 5 months, the baby will be introduced to a real gorilla surrogate. \n\nLast year, a 48-year-old woman, Jenny Webb adopted a baby boy elephant, named Moses. He was only a few weeks old when he was discovered at a wildlife reserve close to death.\n\nMoses lived with Webb in her home, sleeping on a mattress, but sadly he passed away in his human mother's arms.", "title": "Human Surrogate Moms for Baby Gorilla", "publishedDate": "2013-03-01T14:02:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1P4jINe1Ngc", "description": "Follow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Paul-Victor/674734895934018?skip_nax_wizard=true&ref_type=logout_gear\n\nGarage to Silent Partner\n\nYoutube music.\n\nAll rights reserved for Youtube.", "title": "AUDIO YOUTUBE - Garage to Silent Partner", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T08:20:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1P4otUq474k", "description": "\ud654\ub048\ud558\uac8c \ub7a9 '\ub9de\uc7a5'\ub300\uacb0 \ud3bc\ucce4\ub2e4!
