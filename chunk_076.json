Women from across the country visit our practice in St. Louis, Missouri to get the results they need utilizing noninvasive vaginal surgery as well as the most minimally invasive surgical procedures.  Our reputation speaks for itself -- over 500 surgeries each year, many of which are women who have come to us to repair the work from previous surgery.   We prefer to educate women and be their first choice for the best solution.\n\nLabiaplasty\nThe labiaplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is normally treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery can be performed in two ways, either by reducing the excess tissue along the edges of the labia by simply trimming along the inner folds until the labia no longer protrude, or by cutting out a 'V' shaped wedge of tissue from the underneath of the labia, the edges of which are then sewn back together. This method leaves the front of the labia unchanged, making the evidence of surgery less noticeable.\nSurgeons nowadays tend to use dissolvable stitches in this area to aid healing and reduce pain and discomfort. Some surgeons also use a laser rather than a scalpel for cutting to reduce bleeding in the area, as the laser cauterises blood vessels as it cuts.\nVaginoplasty\nThe vaginoplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery is designed to tighten the vagina and is done by joining together the stretched muscle at the back of the vagina and therefore shortening it, using dissolvable stitches, and then removing excess vaginal lining (vaginal mucosa) and tightening the surrounding soft tissues. This procedure may also be done using a laser. The resulting decrease in the size of the vaginal cavity creates more friction during sexual intercourse, often described as giving a woman back the vagina she had before she had children. The G-spot is not affected by this procedure.\nHymenoplasty\nThe hymen is a membrane that partially obstructs the vaginal opening, and is believed by most scientists to have no known anatomical function whatsoever, but is simply a remnant from the development of the foetus into a girl in the womb. There are arguments that it serves as an infection barrier to the vagina in infancy but this is simply a hypothesis", "title": "Disgusting Bodies human life female urogenital system season 1 episode 10", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T11:34:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kL4gg92Qw8", "description": "Ma Page : https://www.facebook.com/Dj.Sif.LMeryoul.Batna.Offishall\n\nMon fb : https://www.facebook.com/dj.sif.l.meryoul", "title": "Cheb Amine 2013- C'est pas la peine Exlusive Mix By Dj Sif 05", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T13:25:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kLyOIxuG-4", "description": "Peter Gago, Penfolds Chief Winemaker and George Taylor, Penfolds Viticulturist give a brief overview of the 2011 Bin 138 Grenache Shiraz Mataro as part of the Penfolds 2013 Bin Series Release.\n\nBuy online at http://danmurphys.com.au/product/DM_88067\n\nFor more info on the 2013 release visit http://danmurphys.com.au/guides/penfolds-new-bin-release-content", "title": "Penfolds Bin 138 Grenache Shiraz Mataro 2011 - 2013 Bin Series Release", "publishedDate": "2013-03-06T20:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kM6Pi14agw", "description": "----------- http://americanpoleandtimber.com ----------- \nWe kiln dry wood before it is treated to remove the free moisture from the cells so that we can adequately penetrate those cells with chemical.", "title": "Why do you kiln dry wood before it is treated?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T03:03:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kMDqVuMtZU", "description": "Hope you enjoy this collab!

Si adem\u00e1s le a\u00f1adimos el hecho de que es uno de los m\u00e1s simples y que cuenta con un n\u00famero de adeptos casi tan grande como el del Blackjack, el resultado es un cl\u00e1sico de los juegos de casino. Tan cl\u00e1sico y famoso que en la pel\u00edcula original de James Bond Casino Royale, el conocido esp\u00eda no jugaba Texas Hold\u00b4em como en el remake de 2006 si no Baccarat. Si nunca has probado este juego, tanto online como en los casinos tradicionales, y quieres aprender c\u00f3mo se juega, este v\u00eddeo te ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda.\n\nReglas B\u00e1sicas de Baccarat o Punto y Banca\n\nBaccarat es una de las mejores opciones si quieres jugar en un casino ya que no requiere ning\u00fan tipo de habilidad, conocimientos o estrategia, si no que depende por completo en el azar. Para ganar debes adivinar y apostar a que: el jugador ser\u00e1 el ganador, la banca ser\u00e1 ganadora o empate entre ambos. El ganador es aqu\u00e9l que tenga una mano lo m\u00e1s pr\u00f3xima posible a 9. Lo primero que debes conocer para jugar al Baccarat es que los valores de las cartas son diferentes de los de cualquier otro juego. As\u00ed, las cartas entre 2 y 9 mantienen su valor original, pero las figuras como Rey, Reina y Jota m\u00e1s el 10 tendr\u00e1n un valor de 0. El As suma 1. En el Baccarat o Punto y Banca, es imposible sumar 10 o m\u00e1s debido a que solamente las unidades son la cifra que se cuenta. Por ejemplo, en casino de recibir dos cincos, en valor es 0 y no 10. En cambio, si se reciben dos seis, el valor de la mano es 2. \n\nJugar al Baccarat o Punto y Banca\n\nPara comenzar, debes apostar por la banca, el jugador o un empate.  Tras esto, la banca repartir\u00e1 dos cartas: primero para el jugador y despu\u00e9s para s\u00ed mismo. Seg\u00fan el valor de las mismas, se repartir\u00e1 una tercera o no. Si la mano del jugador suma un total de entre 6 y 9, el jugador se quedar\u00e1 con esas cartas. En case de sumar 8 o 9, tendr\u00e1 un \"natural\" y ganar\u00e1 la mano autom\u00e1ticamente a no ser que la banca iguale o mejore la mano. En caso de conseguir el mismo valor, se producir\u00e1 un empate. Si la mano del jugador suma 5 o menos, recibir\u00e1 una \u00fanica nueva carta. Por su lado, la banca coger\u00e1 otra carta en caso de sumar 0, 1 o 2 y siempre se quedar\u00e1 con 7, 8 o 9.", "title": "C\u00f3mo Jugar al Baccarat o Punto y Banca", "publishedDate": "2014-07-21T11:14:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kY3tjMjQvA", "description": "\u0b89\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95 \u0bb5\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bbe ??\n\u0b85\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1  \u0bae\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd", "title": "Chennai (moulivakkam) Building Collapse | Ananda Vikatan", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T12:17:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kYCW6OvrAc", "description": "at Dr. Cain's comics in SLO", "title": "Well, I guess this is happening", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21T21:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kYuV2v8vWA", "description": "Char Chir Sasimi on the way to Dusanbe", "title": "Tajikistan 211", "publishedDate": "2012-07-17T03:00:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kZ3rH_QAWM", "description": "A blastback to the Cooper Street Prolosers", "title": "Cozz and The Maschine", "publishedDate": "2011-05-21T03:46:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kZGosrmauI", "description": "The Frill Necked Lizard - Frilled Dragon - Chlamydosaurus kingii - Reptile - Lizards - Reptiles\n\nThe frill-necked lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii), also known as the frilled lizard or frilled dragon, is found mainly in northern Australia and southern New Guinea. This species is the only member of the genus Chlamydosaurus. Its name comes from the large frill around its neck, which usually stays folded against the lizard's body. It is largely arboreal, spending the majority of the time in the trees. The lizard's diet consists mainly of insects and small vertebrates. The frill-necked lizard is a relatively large lizard, averaging 85 cm in length.\n\nThe frill-necked lizard is so called because of the large ruff of skin which usually lies folded back against its head and neck. The neck frill is supported by long spines of cartilage which are connected to the jaw bones. When the lizard is frightened, it produces a startling deimatic display: it gapes its mouth, exposing a bright pink or yellow lining; it spreads out its frill, displaying bright orange and red scales; raises its body; and sometimes holds its tail above its body. This reaction is used for territorial displays, to discourage predators, and during courtship.\nThe lizard is a relatively large member of the agamid family, growing up to 85 centimetres (2.79 ft). It is capable of bipedal locomotion. The frill-necked lizard does not have a standard colour; however, it is characterised by a body that is darker than its frill.\n\nThe frill-necked lizard is found mainly in the northern regions of Australia and southern New Guinea. The lizard inhabits humid climates such as those in the tropical savannah woodlands. The frill-necked lizard is an arboreal lizard, meaning it spends a majority of its time in the trees.The lizard ventures to the floor only in search of food, or to engage in territorial conflicts.[citation needed] The arboreal habitat may be a product of the lizard's diet, which consists mainly of small arthropods and vertebrates (usually smaller lizards).[citation needed] However, the trees are most importantly used for camouflage. There is not one standard colour: rather, colouration varies according to the lizard's environment. For example, a lizard found in a dryer, clay filled environment will most likely have a collage of oranges, reds, and browns; whereas a lizard found in a damper, more tropical region will tend to show darker browns and greys. This suggests that the lizards use their habitats for protection in the form of camouflage.\n\nLike many lizards, frill-necked lizards are insectivorous, feeding on cicadas, beetles, and termites. They especially favour butterflies and moths, their larvae even more so. Though insects are their primary source of food, they also consume spiders, other lizards, and small mammals. Like most members of the agamids (dragons), frill-necked lizards employ an ambush method of hunting, lying in wait for their prey. When the lizards eat, they eat in abundance; these binge periods usually occur during the wet season, when the lizards will ingest hundreds to thousands of alates (ants or termites).\n\nThe frill-necked lizard is ectothermic and maintains its homeostatic body temperature by basking for up to 30 minutes.[citation needed] This achieves an average of 2--3 degrees Celsius above the surrounding temperature. Weather conditions, including sunlight, are the main factors regulating the lizards' temperature.This basking period usually occurs in the morning to early afternoon. During the basking period the lizard will be found near the bottom of a tree and out from under the forest canopy. This ensures maximum exposure to sunlight. However, the lizard's final internal temperature depends mainly on the ambiance of the surrounding environment. It is thought that the lizard's frill aids in thermoregulation.", "title": "The Frill Necked Lizard - Frilled Dragon - Chlamydosaurus kingii - Reptile - Lizards - Reptiles", "publishedDate": "2013-06-30T23:47:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kZYcpRH1og", "description": "My first all grain batch is going nuts.

The generator converts electrical energy into high-frequency energy which is then converted to mechanical energy by the converter and transferred to the clamping ring. The sound waves cause the test sieve frame to oscillate at high-frequencies. These oscillations are transferred to the test sieve cloth where they are evenly distributed. \n\nThe oscillations of the test sieve cloth reduce the frictional resistance between the grains and the screen.

His art is currently being marketed world-wide and forms part of several overseas collections in various countries including UK, Belgium, France, Australia, and Canada.\n\nHe has worked under the following names: Hein v. d. Merwe, Lorek Smith, Robert Slide and J. Morake. His style of art is diverse, as are his topics. He likes to work wet-into-wet and has a tendency towards impasto. He is mainly a self-taught artist and has also studied clear-line art (open segment) especially Herge (Tintin), Uderzo and Goscinny (Asterix), etc. Impressionism has had an influence on his work and his favourite impressionists are: Cezanne, Monet, Manet, Bazille, Boccioni, Bonington, Bonnard, Soutine, Braque, Caillebotte, Cassat, Renoir, Turner, Constable, Corinth, Corot, Degas, Gauguin, Dufy, Jongkind, Seurat, Fritz von Uhde, Matisse, Morisot, Picasso, Pissarro, Sargent, Sisley, Signac, Vuillard, Lautrec, Slevogt, Van Gogh, etc. He has great admiration for the Fauves and the Cubists but admits to be leaning (currently) towards Expressionism. Amongst his favourite Expressionists are: Kandinsky, Erich Heckel, Beckmann, Campendonk, Otto Dix, Feininger, Delaunay, Andre Derain, Ensor, Kokoschka, Schmidt-Rottluff, Grosz, Jawlensky, Kirchner, Paul Klee, Klimt, Max Klinger, Macke, Marc, Otto Mueller, Munch, Wols, Werefkin, Emil Nolde, Pechstein, Rohlfs, Schiele, Modersohn-Becker, Leistikow, Hoelzel, etc. His list of favourite artists goes on to include Modigliani, Piet Mondrian, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Miro, Salvador-Dali, etc.\n\nSouth African artists whose work he was exposed to (and touched) from an early age includes: Maggie Laubser, Irma Stern, Maudsummer, Pranas Domsaitis, JH Pierneef, Alexis Preller, Jan Volschenck, Pierre Volschenk, George Crosland Robinson, Frans Oerder, Hugo Naude, Edith King, Gwelo Goodman, Allerley Glossop, Bertha Everard, Jean Welz, Pieter Wenning, Charles Peers, Edward Roworth, Florence Zerffi, Ruth Prowse, Dorothy Kay, Adolf Jentsch, Moses Kottler, William Timlin, Neville Lewis, Clement Seneque, Alfred Krenz, WH Coetzer, Cecil Higgs, Freida Lock, Wolf Kibel, Ruth Everard-Haden, Walter Battiss, Maurice van Essche, Stefan Ampenberger, Gregoire Boonzaier, Terence McCaw, Gerard Sekoto, Bettie Cilliers-Barnard, Eleanor Esmond-White, Sidney Goldblatt, Carl Buchner, Paul du Toit, Gordon Vorster, Majorie Wallace, Cecil Skotnes, Erik Laubscher, Anna Vorster, Bill Ainslie -- the list of artists he has studied and admired is seemingly endless...\n\nHe has also studied pottery and wood carving where his main stimulus was derived from African art and Folk art. In 1998, he completed a graphic novel, \"The Amazing Adventures of Tom Strak in: The Humming Key\", which was intended for the Asterix and Tin Tin market. His posters are available for pdf download online under the name Lorek Smith. He hopes to one day complete a painting from start to finish without interruption.\n\nFurther aspirations and leanings include to do more abstract paintings, abstract expressionism, Art Brut, colour-field painting, fauvism, hard-edge painting, illusionism, mixed media, Op Art, pointillism, pop art, post-impressionism, more primitivist work, surrealism, stylisation, symbolism, tachisme as well as abstract woodcarving and scupltures and is always on the lookout for strange objects with the intention of creating some found object masterpiece.", "title": "ATTENTION ART LOVERS: Hein van der Merwe Artist - Selection B", "publishedDate": "2011-07-01T12:30:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kxK8KCKlQc", "description": "shit guyanese people say...mostly parents..make sure to leave a message down below rate and subscribe thank you", "title": "sh*t guyanese parents say PT.2", "publishedDate": "2012-06-30T00:13:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kxNYkr_4xg", "description": "September 24th, 2011 in Trumbull, Connecticut.", "title": "Black Team Jumps into Trumbull, Connecticut's Tribute to Fallen Heroes", "publishedDate": "2011-09-24T21:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kxc-7LQR-Q", "description": "From '' Ciphers In The Snow ''\nLabel: Whittier Records -- Whit 6120\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1987\n\nTracklist\nA1 Wifebeater\nA2 Cat's Tale\nA3 Half Alive\nA4 Carpet Man\nA5 S.O.S.\nA6 Asleep/Prisoner\nB1 Dead Guy\nB2 Fallen Idol\nB3 Adam + Evil\nB4 Mankiller\nB5 Hava Nagila\nB6 Logjam\n\n------------------------\n\n\"SOS\", originally titled \"Turn Me On\", was the 3rd single from Swedish pop group ABBA's self-titled 1975 album, their 3rd for Polar Music and their second for Epic and Atlantic.\nIt was released with \"Man in the Middle\" as the B-side.\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog, who sang lead, recorded the song in Swedish on her 1975 solo album Elva kvinnor i ett hus.\n\"SOS\" was ABBA's first major worldwide hit since \"Waterloo\" and, to date, is the only Hot 100 single (or #1 single in Australia) in which both the title and the credited act are palindromes.\n\nOther cover versions\n\nDance covers of the song have been recorded by:\nAbbacadabra,\nE-Rotic,\nThe Element on the Lay All Your Love On ABBA compilation,\nAngeleyes on their album ABBAdance,\nEuphorica on their 2003 album ABBA Dance,\nLes Blue Belles,\nKyria\nand DJ Ensamble on the 2006 album Trancing Queen.\n\nRadha Kali on the compilation The Electronic Tribute To ABBA.\nThe Rasmus\nPamela McNeill covers it on her album Tribute To ABBA.\nThe Black Sweden\nTh' Faith Healers\nHarem Scarem\nBrad Sucks and The Hip Cola\nIn 1975, Lena Andersson\nIn 1975, Marie\nIn 1976, Jana Giergielov\u00e1\n\"Stars on 45 Medley 2\"\nIn 1988, Kees Zaaijer\nIn 1989, Men Without Hats\nIn 1990, Celebrity Skin\nIn 1991, Israelvis\nIn 1992, Stonecake.\nIn 1992, Erasure\nIn 1995, Trizna\nIn 1995, Peter Cetera\nThe 1995 New Zealand compilation Abbasalutely includes a cover by the Able Tasmans.\nIn 1996, Hazell Dean\nIn 1998, The Fire Apes\nIn 1999, A*Teens.\nIn 2000, Mad Caddies\nIn 2000, At Vance\nIn 2001, 2 dance covers of the song by Donna Burke were included on the Japanese import ABBA Ibiza Caliente Mix compilation.\nIn 2001, the tribute album ABBAMetal (also released as A Tribute to ABBA) included a heavy metal version by German band Paradox.\nIn 2001, KBO!\nIn 2002, the Meat Purveyors\nIn 2003, Lionel's Dad (a.k.a.

The tracer was continuously injected into the coastal waters over some weeks; its subsequent spreading and dilution in the Pacific Ocean was then simulated for 10 years. The simulations do not include any data assimilation, and thus, do not account for the actual state of the local ocean currents during the release of highly contaminated water from the damaged plants in March--April 2011. An ensemble differing in initial current distributions illustrates their importance for the tracer patterns evolving during the first months, but suggests a minor relevance for the large-scale tracer distributions after 2--3 years. By then the tracer cloud has penetrated to depths of more than 400 m, spanning the western and central North Pacific between 25\u00b0N and 55\u00b0N, leading to a rapid dilution of concentrations. The rate of dilution declines in the following years, while the main tracer patch propagates eastward across the Pacific Ocean, reaching the coastal waters of North America after about 5--6 years. Tentatively assuming a value of 10 PBq for the net 137Cs input during the first weeks after the Fukushima incident, the simulation suggests a rapid dilution of peak radioactivity values to about 10 Bq m\u22123 during the first two years, followed by a gradual decline to 1--2 Bq m\u22123 over the next 4--7 years. The total peak radioactivity levels would then still be about twice the pre-Fukushima values.\n\nLINKS:\nhttp://oceanrep.geomar.de/14788/\nhttp://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/50176\nhttp://enenews.com/about", "title": "Radiation Of The Pacific Ocean In The Next 10 Years - Japan Nuclear Disaster", "publishedDate": "2013-02-09T01:15:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3l8vf_jmlHM", "description": "WJ Grand Cherokee with 6.5\" long arm lift on km2 on bronco buster Aug 31, 2012", "title": "WJ on Bronco Buster @ Hidden Falls Adventure Park", "publishedDate": "2012-09-03T02:20:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3l8xFCLB1m8", "description": "This video shows the correct Japanese pronunciation of popular Japanese car brands including Nissan, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, Toyota, Mazda, Daihatsu, Honda and Lexus.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods", "title": "Japanese pronunciation of Car Brands", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T23:58:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3l8xHRLgRIA", "description": "A traditional \"cut roof\" with hips, common rafters, ceiling joists.

He belonged to the Antigonid dynasty and was its first member to rule Macedonia.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus. He was defeated at the Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in the neighbourhood of Myus. In the spring of 310, he was soundly defeated when he tried to expel Seleucus I Nicator from Babylon; his father was defeated in the autumn. As a result of this Babylonian War, Antigonus lost almost two thirds of his empire: all eastern satrapies fell to Seleucus.\n\nAfter several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelled the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worshipped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under the title of Soter (\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1) (\"Preserver\").

Every bishop must hold his miter carefully in his arms. He must not sell it for money nor give it up to others for the sake of worldly friendship nor lose it through negligence and lukewarmness. The bishop's miter signifies nothing other than the bishop's rank and power to ordain priests, to prepare the chrism, to correct those who go astray, and to encourage the negligent by his example. To hold his miter carefully in his arms means that he should reflect carefully on how and why he received his episcopal power, how he wields it, and what its effects and purpose are.\n\nIf the bishop would examine how he received his power, he should first examine whether he desired the episcopate for his own sake or for God's. If it was for his own sake, then his desire was no doubt carnal; if it was for God's sake, that is, in order to give glory to God, then his desire was meritorious and spiritual.\nIf the bishop would consider for what purpose he has received the episcopate, then surely it was in order that he might become a father to the poor and a consoler and intercessor for souls, because the bishop's goods are intended for the good of souls. If his means are consumed inefficaciously and wasted in a prodigal manner, then those souls will cry out for revenge on the unjust steward. I will tell you the reward that will come from having held the rank of bishop. It will be a double reward, as Paul says, both corporal and spiritual.\n\nIt will be corporal, because he is God's vicar on earth and is therefore accorded divine honor by men as away of honoring God. In heaven it will be corporal and spiritual because of the glorification of body and soul, because the servant will be there with his Lord, due both to the way he lived as a bishop on earth and to his humble example by which he incited others to the glory of heaven along with himself.

This description is an excerpt of an article I wrote and there is no need to read it. The real meat is in the small business ideas video. To see how I broke free in three months with my home based business click the link above.\n\n\nThe whole idea of creating a home business ideas is a great idea, but a lot of people think it's a hard thing to successfully establish. Home businesses are only hard to establish if you don't know what you're doing. The more knowledge you have about the subject, then the more successful you can become. The tips you learn in this article can help you greatly and start generating some small business ideas.\n\nTake the time to network and advertise. Just because you are working at home doesn't mean you don't need small business ideas contacts. Schedule meetings outside of your home to get away, and meet others in your field. Using networking and marketing events is a great way to build up your network.\n\nMake sure you groom and dress for work, no matter where you are working. Developing this habit will help get you into a productive frame of mind at the start of each work session. It also means, you will be ready to conduct home business outside the house at a moment's notice.\n\nMake sure that any small business ideas you choose can be profitable. Research the demands and trends. Is there a market? Who are the competitors? If the market is crowded, can you fill a niche? Startup costs? Economies of scale? How much income fluctuation? What's the revenue required to cover expenses? It may not easy but doing your homework now may reduce heartbreak later.\n\nWhen starting a home small business ideas , remember to file for a DBA license. A DBA license stands for \"Doing Business As,\" letting the state know the name you are operating under. You'll be able to stay within the letter of the law, and register your business legitimately on various web services as the owner.\n\nDon't give up. There may be a time that you aren't making much money from your small business ideas but keep trying. If you give up, you don't give yourself an opportunity to succeed and do well. Most people that start their own home business go through a time when they don't make any money.\n\nIf you start making a lot of money while running your home small business ideas , it is most likely time for you start looking for someone that you can hire as your financial accountant. Once your small business ideas started picking up, you just can't seem to find enough time to get to the paperwork, right? Do yourself a favor and hire someone to do it for you.\n\nNever spam your home small business ideas out to the world! Don't send unsolicited emails, don't post advertisements on forums (unless they permit it), and don't send your link out ad nauseum on your social media accounts. Be respectful of your audience and entice them to come to your website because of it's content.\n\nThanks for watching this small business ideas video.

Its very important so i can better take care of them. Thanks alot !\n\nA cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or cactus[1]) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, within the order Caryophyllales. The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (kaktos), a name originally used for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north\u2014except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.\nMost cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multi-petaled.\nIn the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Cactus stems also store water, and are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily. Cacti come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft),[2] and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity.[3] The smaller cacti usually have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume with the lowest possible surface area. Many cacti have a short growing season and a long dormancy and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 US gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm.[4]\nLike other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called \"Crassulacean acid metabolism\" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.\nA few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genus Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs that grow around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance they too have many adaptations for water conservation. Pereskia is considered close to the ancestral species that all cacti evolved from. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, like the well known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera).\nCacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, others for food (particularly their fruit).

The most well-known species are probably those in the reef-dwelling genus Platax, the batfishes, which are kept as aquarium fish. \n\nThey are spade-shaped and laterally compressed, and have very symmetrical, triangular dorsal and anal fins. They are shiny silver with areas of yellow and vertical brown or black banding. The eyes are often located in one of the vertical bands as a method of camouflage. \n\nScuba divers sometimes mistake them for angelfish, which are similar in shape, but not closely related. Other genera in the family are characterized by long, trailing, pointed dorsal and anal fins. Most species feed primarily on algae and small invertebrates.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Mowgli Productions Pvt Ltd. \n\nWrite to us for licensing this footage on a broadcast format, for use in your production etc Email Us at : themowgliproductions@gmail.com", "title": "Bat Fish The Ephippidae Family", "publishedDate": "2014-09-22T04:01:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3li5nSoU1F4", "description": "Chanson africaine chant\u00e9 par des jeunes namibiens a Sesfontain en Namibie.\nhttp://www.arroukatchee.fr\nPlus de videos !\nhttp://www.arroukatchee.fr/videoaf_aus.htm", "title": "Chant Africain en Namibie / African singing in Namibia", "publishedDate": "2007-10-19T21:11:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3liCbRZPrZA", "description": "A visual demonstration of the kernel trick in SVM.\n\nThis short video demonstrates how vectors of two classes that cannot be linearly separated in 2-D space, \ncan become linearly separated by a transformation function into a higher\ndimensional space.\n\nThe transformation used is:\nf([x y]) = [x y (x^2+y^2)]\n\nIf you would like a stand-alone file with a high-res version of this movie for academic purposes please contact me.\n\nVisit my homepage http://www.zutopedia.com/udia.html, or read about my latest book \"Zuto: The Adventures of a Computer Virus\", http://www.zutopedia.com", "title": "SVM with polynomial kernel visualization", "publishedDate": "2007-02-05T14:44:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3liSdybwDIo", "description": "My teams were overprepared(may be I should have tested it out before recording) \nIn Viktor battle some characters didn't even have their turn up.

Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.\n\n 2Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,\n\n 3And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?\n\n 4Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.\n\n 5And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.\n\n 6And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\n\n 7Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;\n\n 8And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.\n\n 9Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.\n\n 10When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\n\n 11So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\n\n 12And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.\n\n 13And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.\n\n 14Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.\n\n 15Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.\n\n 16And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\n\n 17Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.\n\n 18Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.

Osborne\nScreenwriter: Don Mancini, John Lafia, Tom Holland\nFilm Description: Child's Play seems to have been concocted by a parent who went berserk after standing in line for hours on end to purchase a Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980s. The film opens with serial killer Brad Dourif taking refuge in a doll factory. Dourif is killed by the cops, but not before he has invoked a voodoo curse which transfers his soul into one of the dolls. That particular doll, nicknamed Chuckie, is unwittingly purchased by Catherine Hicks for her son Alex Vincent. Several murders occur shortly thereafter; all evidence points to Alex, who insists that his cherub-faced doll is responsible. Detective Chris Sarandon, the man responsible for Dourif's death, doesn't swallow Alex's story, but he agrees to investigate because he's sweet on Alex's mom. The slasher-flick ending of Child's Play would seem to have settled Chuckie's hash for good and all, but guess again--the film spawned numerous sequels.\n\n\"child's play\",\"child's play clip\",\"child's play full movie\",\"child's play 3\",\"child's play trailer\",\"child's play 2 full movie\",\"child's play 3 full movie\",\"child's play 2 trailer\",\"child's play remake\",\"laura moskowitz\",\"apartment videos\",horror,\"tom holland\",\"david kirschner\",\"elliot geisinger\",\"evil videos\",\"barrie m osborne\",\"karen barclay\",\"catherine hicks\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"elevator videos\",\"cult horror\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9230,/m/04lb3k", "title": "Child's Play (4/12) Movie CLIP - Chucky Escapes (1988) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T00:40:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "3lzElA_uxog", "description": "Xavier defeated Marquette, 86-79, on the strength of 28 points from Semaj Christon to improve to 3-0 in the BIG EAST.", "title": "Xavier Men's Basketball Highlights - Marquette", "publishedDate": "2014-01-10T05:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3lzIo_FChE0", "description": "This lady was daring to go around the city with her breasts out (legally in NYC).

She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[10][11] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[10] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[12] although her only known Native American ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649.[10]\nAfter her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[13] As a child, Jolie often watched movies with her mother and explained this had inspired her interest in acting; she stated that she was not influenced by her father's career.[14] When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[15] they returned to Los Angeles five years later. She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.\nAt the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director.[16] She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London. During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.[14] Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.[13] She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heart\u2014and always will be\u2014just a punk kid with tattoos.\nWilliam Bradley \"Brad\" Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. Pitt has received four Academy Award nominations and five Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one Golden Globe. He has been described as one of the world's most attractive men, a label for which he has received substantial media attention.[1][2]\nPitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the road movie Thelma & Louise (1991). His first leading roles in big-budget productions came with A River Runs Through It (1992), Interview with the Vampire (1994), and Legends of the Fall (1994). In 1995, he gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film 12 Monkeys, the latter earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination. Four years later, Pitt starred in the cult hit Fight Club. He then starred in the major international hit Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). His greatest commercial successes have been Troy (2004) and Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Pitt received his second and third Academy Award nominations for his leading performances in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In addition, Pitt owns a production company, Plan B Entertainment, whose productions include The Departed (2006), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Moneyball, which garnered a Best Picture nomination.\nFollowing a high-profile relationship with actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Pitt was married to actress Jennifer Aniston for five years. Pitt lives with actress Angelina Jolie in a relationship that has attracted wide publicity.[3] He and Jolie have six children\u2014Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. Since beginning his relationship with Jolie, he has become increasingly involved in social issues both in the United States and internationally.", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt cute couple interview", "publishedDate": "2013-07-03T06:55:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3m3eAYXbOnw", "description": "Cool song! :D\n\nBand: Adora\nAlbum: Safeguard The Helpless\nSong: The Era Of Destruction\ngenre: Hardcore\n\nSupport the owners!

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Sexy Asian babe eats octopus while still alive!!!

The film, a docu-drama and SYR's major project in 2010, was funded by the Big Lottery and supported by Diverse FM, Ashuk Ahmed MBE and many others.\n\nThe premiere was chaired by Lord Ahmed.  In addition to the attendance of many distinguished guests and volunteers, SYR was particularly honored to have in attendance Lord Hussain, Lord Dubs, Dr. Nazia Khanum OBE, Mushtaq Lasharie, DCI Nigel Stone (Bedfordshire Police), Chaz Akoshile (incoming Joint Head of the Government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU)), and Deborah Aitken (Consular Officer of the Canadian High Commission).  \n\nLord Ahmed recalled how, as the one of the first people in the Asian community to raise the issue of forced marriage publicly, he had received threats from his community.  Lord Hussain highlighted the importance of educating parents about the problem and reiterated that forced marriage was against all mainstream religions.  Lord Dubs encouraged everyone present to take the anti-forced marriage message to their communities and pledged to highlight the issue in the political arena.  While Dr Khanum OBE, who chaired the SYR research and ethics committee, spoke out against any criminalisation of forced marriage on the ground that victims were reluctant to imprison their parents.  Chaz Akoshile noted the importance of inter-agency work and co-operation.  Deborah Aitken said that she was now coming across a number of cases of forced marriage involving Canadian citizens.\n\nAt the event, SYR also launched a research paper, 'The Legal Framework on Forced Marriages in the United Kingdom and some Recommendations.'  The paper, compiled by a specially commissioned research and ethics team, \nexamines the development of the law on forced marriage and considers developments in the wake of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007.  Samir Pasha, the team leader, outlined recommendations for future developments in the area.\n\nLynne Townley (SYR Secretary), Mamunul Islam MBA (SYR Projects Director) and Ranjula Takodra MBE (SYR President) gave votes of thanks to all those who had assisted with the doc-drama and the research report.  Lynne further highlighted how the charity functioned solely on the goodwill of its volunteers and outlined how SYR planned to campaign on an international level in future through creative use of its available resources, in particular, the internet. \n\nForced marriage is an abuse of human rights and a fundamental wrong.  It is not lawful in the UK.  However, many young people living in this country are forced into marriages against their will every year. In 2010, the FMU dealt with 1,735 cases.  The creation of the FMU and the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 are important measures to stop this abuse from occurring. \n\nUnfortunately, for many of those threatened by forced marriage, legal remedies are often remote and difficult to access. Victims can be vulnerable and may also be at risk from honour-based violence.  Many are under intense pressure from their families and communities to be complicit to the marriage. Some may also fear that taking legal action will not assist them.  Furthermore, if any legal interventions are to be effective, they must be supported not only by active community engagement, but also by changes in society. \n\nDownloads and Notes to the editors:\nDownload film trailer: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=EW2TZJSG \nDownload event photos: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=LGRXY4GE \n\nSave Your Rights (SYR) is a registered human rights charity (No - 1130378).

I was very excited to have the opportunity to test one of the hottest toys this holiday season - Hot Wheels RC Street Hawk Remote Controlled Flying Car as a BzzAgent! Well... actually I had my 10 year old boy / girl twins and 11 year old son test it for me. Like most kids that get a new \"amazingly\" fun toy, each begged to play with it over and over again. It was amazing how you could remotely control it driving on the ground and then the next minute send it flying into the air. It was a little more difficult to control it when it was in the air, but it still was a blast! All three gave it two thumbs up!\n\nNow for my point of view. This toy is a great toy for any boy, and even a girl! The age on the box stated that the toy was for people 8 yrs old and older. I actually think this toy is more geared for 10 years and older. I don't think my boys would have been careful enough with this toy at the age of 8 years old and the would have broken it within a few minutes. \n\nThis toy is made of a foam like material and thin plastic parts. It's delicate in many ways. My boys thought it was pretty tough because they crashed it a few times. I'm not sure how many crashes this street hawk will be able to take. My gut says not many more. My last recommendation is that you also shouldn't fly it when it is windy. It is too hard to control and it will crash!\n\nOverall this toy will keep your kids entertained (both boy and girl). I highly recommend it for this holiday season!\n\n5 stars for fun and entertainment! \n3 stars for durability!\n\n*As a Bzzagent, I was given this toy to review by Mattel for my honest review.", "title": "Hot Wheels RC Street Hawk Remote Controlled Flying Car Review by Melissa Perry Moraja and Kids", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T23:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3mJETfQXm_k", "description": "Dive into the mysteries and fan theories of all things animation with your host Emily, as she takes a critical look at how the theories hold up. \n\nThis week, we're looking at the \"Spongebob and Nuclear Bomb Theory\" which claims that Spongbob Squarepants and the rest of Bikini Bottom is the result of nuclear radiation.\n\nSubscribe to Channel Frederator for more Cartoon Conspiracies:\nhttp://frdr.us/14vBVDM\n\nChannel Frederator:\nTumblr:\nhttp://channelfrederator.tumblr.com/\nFacebook:\nhttp://frdr.us/11UPUO2\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/channelfred\nBlog:\nhttp://frederator.com/\nBuy T-Shirts:\nhttp://frdr.us/NoyLLk\nFollow on Instagram:\nhttp://instagram.com/cartoonhangover\nGoogle+:\nhttp://plus.ly/toonhangover\nBehance:\nhttp://be.net/cartoonhangover\n\nStarring: Emily from EmilyTheBrave\nDirected by: Emily Lynne Carson\nWritten by: Emily Lynne Carson and David Byrne\nExecutive Producer: Fred Seibert\nProducer: Carrie Miller, Matt Gielen, Chris Troise\nEdited by: Emily Lynne Carson, Nicholas Fung\nBackground Art by: Matt Bolinger\nGraphics by: Ben Kling\n\nEmily's Links:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/emilythebravee\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/emilythebravee\nTumblr\nhttp://emilythebravee.tumblr.com/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/emilythebravee\nInstagram\nhttp://instagram.com/emilythebravee\n\nMusic provided by:\nKevin MacLeod\nhttp://incompetech.com/\n\nChannel Frederator is cartoon central on the Internet. \nRemember: Frederator loves you.\n\nImages used:\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121116031105/spongebob/images/e/eb/PaintythePirate.jpg\nhttp://blogs.isb.bj.edu.cn/16alexanderc/files/2013/04/radiation1.jpg\nhttp://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/220444181/Cosmetic_Facial_Sponge.jpg\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81tRAs6KW00/T9spHKJStuI/AAAAAAAACP0/q5-fc5dqVU4/s1600/Pineapple.jpg\nhttp://blogs.independent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Taiara-Atoll-French-Polynesia.jpg\nhttp://dceg.cancer.gov/PublishedContent/Images/images/content/marshall_islands_lg.jpg\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Bikini_2244493428_13643c6505_o.jpg\nhttp://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120725001642/spongebob/images/2/2e/Mr._Krabs_%26_The_Krusty_Krab_Picture.jpg\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130128000721/spongebob/images/9/98/DSCN0608.JPG\nhttp://w8themes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Funny-Spongebob-Wallpaper.jpg\nhttp://xjselman.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/spongebob-this-cant-be.jpg\nhttp://wallpines.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/spongebob-squarepants-wallpaper-desktoplist.jpg\nhttp://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140206175730/mobrosstudios/images/thumb/9/9e/Bikini_Bottom.jpg/1280px-Bikini_Bottom.jpg\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/Help_Wanted_(SpongeBoy_Ahoy!).jpg\nhttp://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nuclear-bomb-explosion.jpg", "title": "A Nuclear Bomb Creates Spongebob?

I'm drug-free so why should I listen to you?\"\n\nFair question.\n\nFor the record: I think EVERYONE SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE A DRUG- FREE ATHLETE.\n\nNo matter what you're taking, you BETTER make sure your body is working optimally on the INSIDE and your training is MAXIMIZED on the outside.\n\nYou can take as many \"extra-curricular supplements\" as you want, and if your body isn't treated as a whole organism; maximizing recovery, controlling inflammation and balancing hormones - its going to BREAK DOWN very, very quickly. Your gains will be limited and not long-term.\n\nThere are TONS of juice monkeys in every gym taking stuff and NOT growing. They have the \"eat more protein, lift more weight approach\".\n\nSorry folks, the days of the dumb meathead are LONG GONE along with parachute pants and bandanas.\n\nNinety percent of my clients are 100% drug-free so I know my methods are equally effective for drug-free & drug-assisted individuals. I approach ANY athlete by looking at the body as a whole. If there is ONE ingredient missing from the pie, you won't be responding in the best way possible.\n\nWhat someone chooses to do above and beyond PERFECT training concepts and optimal nutrition is their own choice. Anabolic \"assistance\" or not, why wouldn't anyone want to minimize their time in the gym and maximize results? Sounds like pretty simple meathead math to me.\n\n\"I grew up training natural and eating clean. There was no cutting corners for me. My mediocre genetics would NEVER allow it!\"\n\nIn fact, I have always preferred working with drug-free trainees because it's more of a challenge and requires a more thoughtful & intelligent approach. We must carefully analyze every aspect if we want them to beat their non drug-free counterparts! They often tend to be much more receptive to an intelligent \"whole body\" approach.\n\nDrugs or no-drugs, professional bodybuilders are just like you. We obviously have different caloric requirements, different training load, but at the end of the day, we're all trying to get 100% out of our bodies. We push our limits, minimize injuries, recover as fast as possible and do it all over again!\n\nThe smarter bodybuilders, like myself, focus on how to optimize recovery: short term and long term. This is the limiting factor to muscle growth! The faster you can recover, the more time you spend being anabolic (growing). Improve your capacity to recover faster and you can train again sooner to stimulate more new growth.\n\nMy personal motto has always been: \n\n\"The more you know, the more you grow!\"", "title": "How to Build Muscle Mass Fast with N.O.S. - Neurological Overload Set", "publishedDate": "2011-12-01T14:06:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3mKOsPYfpVg", "description": "On Nov. 18, 2012, the Israel Air Force targeted an underground rocket launching site near a mosque in Gaza.

The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera.[1]\nHamsters are crepuscular animals which burrow underground in the daylight to avoid being caught by predators. Their diets include a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables. In the wild, they feed primarily on seeds, fruits and greens, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects.[2] They have an elongated pouch on each side of their heads that extends to their shoulders, which they stuff full of food to be stored, brought back to the colony or to be eaten later.\nHamster behavior varies depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people. Because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals. Hamsters have also become established as popular small house pets,[3] and are sometimes accepted even in areas where other rodents are disliked, and their typically solitary nature can reduce the risk of excessive litters developing in households.\nAlthough the Syrian hamster or golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) was first described scientifically in 1839, researchers were not able to successfully breed and domesticate hamsters until 1939.[3] The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters appear to be descendants of a single brother-sister pairing. These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo [Syria] by Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of Jerusalem.[4] In Jerusalem, the hamsters bred very successfully. Years later, animals of this original breeding colony were exported to the USA, where Syrian hamsters became one of the most popular pets and laboratory animals. Comparative studies of domestic and wild Syrian hamsters have shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain.

First and foremost, the Blueberry has been designed to provide the commanding, intimate presence associated with the world's best (and most expensive) vintage vocal microphones. With its shimmering, detailed highs, smooth midrange, and minimized proximity effect (a bass boost inherent in all unidirectional mics), the Blueberry excels at delivering a vocal right to the front of the mix where it belongs. When processed with limiting and/or compression, as is standard practice for most pop vocals, tracks recorded with the Blueberry will be free of pumping, low frequency thumps. Acoustic guitar, hand percussion, drums, and other critical high end sources also shine in front of the Blueberry, gaining an extra measure of presence that enables the most delicate sounds to cut through a mix, even at very low levels. Designed to fill the needs of the home musician and the professional alike, the Blueberry includes the Series Two Shockmount and comes handsomely packaged in its own cherrywood box. Whatever your music, add a Blueberry to the mix and let your ears feast on the sound.

See the quartet grassroots rules dealt with this divide and you cannot die. Blanching, scary, packaging and rectify cooking. Vegetables cannot be cold raw. They staleness be livid freshman, whilst freshwater and tenderize. Blanching vegetables helps to honour in the variety, form and nutritive appreciatefreezing vegetables. Raw vegetables stored in a freezer give regress property easily.\n\nVisite Us For More Info : http://lchflowcarb.blogspot.com\n\n1.Blanching\n\nThis is quite casual. Put about 1 lb. of overbold moral vegetables into a blanching goal session in a larger quantity of rapidly cookery wet freezing vegetables. Do no add flavoring. Base a choky trial lid in perspective and move until the nutrient returns to the temperature before starting the blanching experience. Blanching nowadays variegate depending on the size of the being pieces of vegetal. 1\u00bd proceedings is abundant blanching term.freezing vegetables Monition 1 advance pieces of river beans would verify 2 proceedings, unit beans or diminutive lank carrots would demand 3 minutes. Callus on the cob, beingness large relieve would direct 5-8 proceedings depending on the situation.\n\nConsequently judging the blanching instant required becomes rich formerly the situation factor is remembered. For warning a cauliflower unexhausted healthy, would necessity blanching for 6-9 minutes. Still, if the cauliflower is ground 2-3 proceedings would be good. Potatoes, kumara and squash should be half stewed before cooling freezing vegetables. Blanching is meagre for this write of stalklike. Symptom apace then solidify on trays for 2 hours before packaging and returning to the freezer. Vegetable stabilize can be successfully nonmoving by half cookery without peeling. Dread apace, then pol and cut or cut before packaging in repast size quantities. No encourage cooking is required, as the abyssal solidify tra freezing vegetables\n{serve as wanted. Mushrooms also block shaft freezing vegetables. Fry lightly in butter and scatter out to precooled on passionless plates. Low withhold unloving mushrooms by the vapid feature method.\n\nAs an choice method, simmer mushrooms in river until weak. Change with playwright flour for superior results, lead to chilly completely before packaging in meal-size quantities. To suffice mushrooms only reheat whilst console frozen and use in your favorite instruction. Cold roast mushrooms will fastness in goodish premise for up to 4 months freezing vegetables freezing vegetables.\n\n2.Scarey\n\nWhen blanching moment is all freezing vegetables, amend blanching goal from boiling thing and gently someone from preparation wet and gently acquisition vegetables into a colander session in ice inhuman h2o. A impede of ice placed in a engraft engorged of refrigerating irrigate instrument swiftness up the scarey transform than they do to colour, if you use ice in the shivery facility.

For person ending pat dry with a cleansed tea towel freezing vegetables .I praise the disengage course method of packaging or the unstimulating feature.\n\n4.Cooking\n\nSo some frostbitten vegetables are injury by overcooking. Refer, they have been already been tender twice. Erst when livid, and again whilst stored below adjust in your freezer freezing vegetables. Hence, very emotional cookery is required. Do not flux it only driblet unthawed vegetables into stewing preserved h2o. When thing returns to the moil freezing vegetables, lower the temperature then simmer for one base or less of the cookery dimension commonly assumption to overbold vegetables. Although all unchangeable vegetables should be braised from the cold suggest I conceptualize whiskey on the cob the elision to the eternal clip to deice in the move. I advise weather cereal cobs for at minimal 2 hours before cookery in boiling preserved h2o for 5-6 transactions freezing vegetables.

In the terms of graphic tablets, the leader in the industry is the Wacom tablet, also pronounced many other different ways. They have different products, such as pen displays which are tablets that can range from this size, maybe 12 inches to about maybe 17, 22 inches, and you see the display on the actual tablet, which is really helpful if you're an illustrator or if you are a digital painter, or anything that really requires a lot of close up work, and that you want to work entirely on screen with.\n\nThose are of course, the more expensive ones. Then there are the pen tablets. Those are the ones that you usually see off to the side, that a lot of designers use as well. I use them, not being an extreme illustrator, but it definitely helps with precision and with making sure that you're able to do edits where needed. It works best in Photoshop, any of the Adobe products, and then it also you can use it as a mouse too, as a natural mouse.\n\nAnother new thing that they've done, they've also created stuff for the mobile device. So they have an application for the iPad which is actually called Bamboo Paper. You can use it to also sketch down different ideas and notes.\n\nAs with any touchscreen device, you need a special tool to use the application, and this one that I have is the Boxwave Pen, which is a really good stylus.

When combined with other Indian film industries (Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada), it is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced, and maybe also the number of tickets sold. The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood (the famous center of the United States film industry).\nBollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission. Such movies are called masala movies, after the spice mixture masala. Like masala, these movies have everything.

And I quote: 'No Members of Congress should be surprised at the havoc brought by the sequester. After all, they caused it, and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood repeatedly warned them about its consequences.'  \n\n\"But flight delays are just the tip of the iceberg, visible above the waterline for most Americans, and as time goes on, without a big balanced deficit solution to replace the sequester, more of that iceberg will surface, more Americans will be negatively affected. \n\n\"While I want to end these delays for passengers in Maryland and across the country, I will oppose this bill because it fails to address the whole impact of sequester. Let me share just a handful of examples of how the sequester will affect Americans. \n\n\"Education: Head Start, 70,000 children will be kicked out of Head Start. Nothing in this bill deals with them. Furloughs to cause delays in processing retirement for disability claims -- nothing in this bill deals with them. Four million fewer Meals on Wheels for seniors. 600,000 people dropped off WIC -- nothing in here for them. Housing: 125,000 less HUD rental assistant vouchers -- nothing in here for them. Emergency unemployment insurance cut 11% for two million out-of-work Americans -- nothing in here for them. FDA: 2,100 fewer food safety inspectors, an 18% cut -- nothing in here for them. Longer waits to approve new drugs -- nothing in here for them. Defense and homeland security: furloughs equivalent to 1,000 fewer federal agents, FBI, border, etc., on the job; one third of combat air units are grounded -- nothing in here for them. 89,000 agency-wide furloughs in IRS, up to seven days, including taxpayer assistance centers -- nothing in here for them. They serve 89,000 taxpayers trying to find help. [Note: Rep. Hoyer misspoke -- the figure is 97 million taxpayers.]\n\n\"We ought not to be mitigating the sequester's effect on just one segment when children, the sick, our military and many other groups who will be impacted by this irresponsible policy are left unhelped. Instead of dressing this serious wound with a small band-aid, let's get to work on a real solution, let's go to conference, let's get a big deal, let's deal with all the adverse consequences of sequester, not just those that affect the powerful air travelers of America.

Nouakchott has about a million people, roughly one third of Mauritania's sparse population and is said to be the largest city truly in the Sahara Desert. It's a sprawling lowrise place with a few taller government ministries and hotels but little else to suggest it's a capital city. It's laid out in a grid pattern with wide streets named after famous people (John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, General DeGaulle), but with paved streets mostly covered in a thick layer of sand, the city and desert meld together rather well; although only a few miles from the Atlantic, Nouakchott is much more of a desert than a coastal city. Perhaps it's just especially visible because of the lack of vegetation, but Nouakchott must also be the most rubbish-strewn place I've ever seen. \n\nThe markets in Nouakchott are thoroughly African with women all lined up and sitting beside their bags of identical produce and other wares, but there's actually rather little variety in Mauritania since almost all produce must be imported and is very expensive. \n\nWe stayed both times at the Auberge Menata where room upgrades or setting our tents up on the roof were options, but we all chose to sleep on mattresses on the open under mosquito nets the staff set up for us. The need for mosquito nets wasn't clear to me here since we weren't yet in an area where malaria was supposed to be present and there was no evidence of any insects other than a few sand flies. It must have been a particularly enchanted spot, since both nights I had some of the most amazing Lariam dreams of my trip (detailed in my parallel \"Lariam Dreams\" blog). \n\nOn our second pass through Nouakchott we had most of an afternoon to kill in town. After I checked my e-mail at an Internet cafe, Ben and I decided to catch a taxi to the Port de Peche, Nouakchott's colorful, lively seaside fishing port and market and supposedly its most interesting spot. The coast near Nouakchott seems devoid of natural harbors and the city itself is not oriented towards the sea its proximity to the Atlantic. These combine to create a large village atmosphere at the fishing port and forces the fishermen to head right through the breakers to land on the sandy beach with their catches. The lack of a sheltered harbor also means mooring their crafts on dry land on the beach and thus limits the size of their boats. \n\nBen and I seemed to be the only tourists at the port and were generally ignored by the hard-working people, mostly Black Africans from the Wolof and tribes in contrast to the lighter-skinned Maures who constitute most of Mauritania's population. The difference in peoples' physical stature was at least as notable as that of their skin color, with the Black fishermen seeming much taller, broader, and more muscularly built than the peoples we had been among for the last several weeks through Morocco and Mauritania. The fishermen were friendly and genuine, tolerant of photos and open to conversation, and not a single person asked us for a cadeau. \n\nThe Port de Peche was one of those places with a \"Real Africa\" feel about it, a hive of activity with many hundreds of colorful small fishing boats grounded on the beach and dozens more in sight out to see in the coastal fog. Every few minutes one would come in rapidly towards the beach with the men jumping out to push it on shore. Soon a donkey pulled cart would rush out onto the beach with boxes of fish quickly unloaded onto the cart to be taken up the beach to the market. The market had one of the most impressive and beautiful varieties of fish and seafood I've seen anywhere - Saint Pierre, John Dory, Sole, Mackerel, Snapper, and plenty of others I didn't recognize. \n\nWhile the fish catch in Nouakchott appeared impressive to my layman's eye, the reality is that West African fisheries are overexploited and far from healthy.

This video is in continuation with my earlier video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yZgSZRoC3o. As all of us know that there is no medicines for dengue & no specific treatment. Treatment are given only after observing the patient. In most of the dengue patient it is seen that the platelet used to fall fast to as low as 40,000. So in order to maintain the minimum platelet level papaya leaf juice used to come very handy in maintaining the platelet while normal medical treatment for dengue is in progress. I have uploaded this video after interviewing many patients who have consumed papaya leaf juice & recovered very fast than the other dengue patients who did not consume dengue leaves. The two child shown in this video consuming papaya leaves juice are also dengue patient but they recovered very soon within 3 days & their platelet at present is above 2,00,000. Try to drink the papaya leaf juice in raw condition without mixing honey/water for better result. It is better to give a try then to loose somebody very precious to you. DANGUE IS DANGEROUS! CARE IS THE BEST CURE. \nNote: Another plant can increase your blood platelets you can view the same at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxwaKgiHRn4\nAedes mosquito (Dengue) lay their eggs in clear, clean water & they fly only a few meters usually in our house itself such as Water coolers/collection pans in Fridge/Air Conditioners. Stagnant rain water, neglected fish ponds, water in tyres etc. are the major place for breeding of dengue mosquitoes in cities.\n\nWarning: The viewer/reader of this video/documentation should exercise all precautionary measures while following instructions on the home remedies from this video.

(I kick myself, now, for not knowing about it sooner, as I could've been growing my own healthful and delicious watercress leaves, at home, for years and years!)\n\nSome weeks ago I set up some watercress to grow, in a large basin of water--half flat spring water, and half tap water. It's done very well, and is now growing up and over the sides of the basin.\n\nIt should now be possible for me to do this on a larger scale. In theory, I can now produce fresh watercress in my bathtub, as there is quite enough light in the bathroom. Since flat springwater is so expensive,  I could add a teaspoon or two of garden lime to the water in the bathtub. That should keep it nice and alkaline, as watercress, in nature, flourishes in \"chalk streams\"--the water run-off from limestone quarries. The aquarium pump and airstone I have, at present, would be of quite sufficient size to keep the water in a bathtub fresh, aerated and non-stagnant.\n\nMaybe I'll get an old bathtub and put it on the verandah? The fibreglass ones they make, nowadays, are light and easy to carry. Elsewise I could set up a heavy old enamelled metal bathtub in the garden somewhere. A solar-powered pump would mean no electricity co$t$ whatsoever!!!!\n\nRemember:\n\nWatercress requires sufficient light. \n\nIt prefers alkaline conditions. So use non-carbonated spring water available from your supermarket. (I have used 100% springwater successfully, but even 50% springwater would probably be okay--making up the other 50% with tapwater.) Or experiment with small amounts of garden lime added to the water.\n\nWatercress enjoys circulating water. So use an aquarium pump and air stone to circulate the water and keep it fresh and aerated. Solar-electric pump means free electricity!\n\nPlant the rooted pieces of watercress--available from your supermarket--in pots of coarse sand or gravel. You can also put some large pebbles under the pots to increase water circulation underneath a little. (BTW, some Asian shops sell true watercress seeds in their gardening seeds section.)\n\nSubmerge pots in the spring water. The plants will be anchored by their roots in the pots; but will be happily growing ABOVE the water. Just as they do in streams.\n\nDo NOT allow watersnails into your watercress pond, as they can carry liverfluke, which are harmful to humans. So no grabbing watersnails from your aquarium and adding them to the watercress tub! (I found a live SLUG in the bunch of watercress I bought from Woolworths, last week! And slugs, snails and watersnails can carry fluke which are harmful to humans if ingested!)\n\nIt's fun to try this, anyway. So get the kids to have a go! (And remember, watercress contains more  vitamin C than oranges; more calcium than milk; and more iron than spinach!)\n\n(\u2022\u203f\u2022)\n\n\u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665 \u2665", "title": "\u2704 Harvesting Watercress \u2701 \u2702  \u2703", "publishedDate": "2012-08-23T07:58:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nW_6UFEG9c", "description": "Need to take the Saiga apart to clean?

Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance.

We customize each individual scar and stretch mark removal treatment for every patient. Scars and stretch marks are typically treated with three different lasers in each session.\n\nFirst, every scar or stretch mark is individually targeted. Next, we do an overall color blending of the scar area (painting), causing the turn-over of your base-line melanin (old melanin is replaced with new) which evens out your coloration. Thirdly, to fill in the scar from the inside out, we will stimulate the production of collagen with an intense collagen treatment. This targets old deteriorated collagen deep in the dermis in order to accelerate its removal by your bodys own natural processes. We will also target fibroblast cells throughout your dermis, stimulating them to produce amplified quantities of new young collagen.\n\nThe last portion of the scar and stretch mark removal treatment will smooth out the surface of your scar with an epidermal resurfacing (laser peel). This phase removes a few microns (30-50%) of the epidermis (the dead cells on the top layer of your skin), along with its imperfections, discolorations, fine wrinkles and roughness.\n\nScar and stretch mark removal usually will take approximately 4-6 treatments in 3-4 week intervals.", "title": "Laser Scar Removal Treatment from American Medical Aesthetics", "publishedDate": "2008-09-12T20:22:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nshTqinVNs", "description": "Um dos piores lugares que eu fiquei hospedado em 75 dias de viagem pela Am\u00e9rica de moto foi esse ai!!! kkkk", "title": "Sem passaporte na Bolivia - S\u00e9rgio Mahoe", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T08:39:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nsnu8icaLQ", "description": "\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03a6\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf [Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) Wint.] \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2", "title": "\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03a6\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf [Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) Wint.] \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T08:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nsqrh6gC5c", "description": "The Sam Feldt remix of 'Guitar Track' by Sander van Doorn & Firebeatz.\nFree download https://www.facebook.com/officialsamfeldt/app_208195102528120\nPurchase the original http://btprt.dj/1dGjxKr\n\nSam Feldt\nhttp://www.facebook.com/officialsamfeldt\nhttps://soundcloud.com/samfeldt\nhttp://www.twitter.com/samfeldtmusic\n\nSander van Doorn\nhttp://www.facebook.com/sandervandoorn\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sandervandoorn\nhttp://www.twitter.com/sandervandoorn\n\nFirebeatz\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Firebeatz/194275327250541\nhttps://soundcloud.com/firebeatz\nhttp://www.twitter.com/firebeatz\n\nEDM Broadcast\nhttp://www.facebook.com/EDMBroadcast\nhttp://twitter.com/edm_broadcast\n\nDownload the image set \nhttp://on.fb.me/1jYmj0y\n\nWant to submit a track?

To make matters worse, a leading religous faction have managed to create a mobile atomic bomb and appear dedicated to the complete domination of the planet. \n\nThe Galactic Police Federation have no choice but to send the intrepid Jim Long and crew disguised as they try and find these religious leaders. With the lives of over ten million city dwellers at stake, Jim must stop the fanatics from releasing the backpack atomic bomb. To complicate matters further is the discovery of a 3000 year old spaceship, giving rise to more questions than answers. \n\nDivine Fanaticism is an easy, enjoyable book to read. Told in an uncomplicated style that should engage both young and old, the pace is fast and the humour very prevalent. There are a great deal of ideas explored in the book, with of course the main theme of religious fanaticism running throughout. The principle protagonist Jim Long is a very interesting and larger than life character and along with others keep the novel from becoming too serious. Although this is the fourth novel in the Jim Long series, it's not necessary to have read any of the previous novels and the book works very well as a stand alone story. \n\nOverall Divine Fanaticism is fun and refreshing, the story easygoing and the heavy religious subject matters are very much tongue in cheek, the story has a very strong sense of the classic pulp science fiction novels of the mid 20th century. A pleasant book to read and one that should appeal to all ages....Ant....SFbook.com\n\n'... a very clever idea -- it works very successfully as a sci-fi action novel, a terrorist suspense thriller, an implicit critique on religious fundamentalism and also as a psychological/ metaphysical detective story.\n The interrogation of Jel Hal Kinima by Jim Long, is of course one of the highlights of the novel - a masterly piece of dramatic exposition, in my opinion, in which Jim slowly, surgically, psychologically breaks down Kinima's illusions - comparisons with the parable of the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov even sprung to mind!' \n-- AESOP Editorial", "title": "JL- Trailer- Divine Fanaticism 3", "publishedDate": "2011-12-03T14:10:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nw68WY-hSY", "description": "(Vrum-27/12/09)Novo Palio Economy chega ainda mais econ\u00f4mico, como mostra Emilio Camanzi", "title": "Vrum testa o Fiat Palio Economy", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T18:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3nwDiSqT3_E", "description": "Lassa Tyres Drift Team at Posty meet (The Old Post Office Pub) in Barnsley on 6th May 2012.

In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing.\n\n\"iron man\",\"iron man clip\",\"iron man 3\",\"iron man black sabbath\",\"iron man 2\",\"robert downey jr\",\"machine gun videos\",\"missile videos\",\"tanks videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"comic books and superheroes\",\"stan lee\",\"avi arad\",\"kevin feige\",\"louis desposito\",\"david maisel\",\"jon favreau\",\"eric heffron\",\"peter billingsley\",\"jeremy latcham\",\"ari arad\",\"war videos\",\"village videos\",\"tony stark\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++353425,/m/016z2j", "title": "Iron Man to the Rescue - Iron Man (8/9) Movie CLIP (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T15:54:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3o2wg6blhJA", "description": "MicrobiologyBytes Video Library: http://microbiologybytes.com/video", "title": "Tetrahymena pyriformis", "publishedDate": "2011-02-21T12:21:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3o3HNQ_qTkg", "description": "Neverland Manila 2014 Apster and D-Wayne", "title": "Neverland Manila 2014 Apster and D-Wayne", "publishedDate": "2014-10-04T08:11:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3o3jJXm4bZ0", "description": "Trailer for WRT 205", "title": "Victimization and Oppression of Black Women Trailer", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T00:22:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3o3wcnb4RGc", "description": "Video of case with ankylosing spondylitis pain starting from hip joint,  it progressed towards back and then neck is affected.

If you want them to taste like Hardee's biscuits then I recommend using White Lily flour, it's made of soft winter wheat and makes for a light, tender biscuit.  If you don't have that flour, it would probably work well with cake flour.\n\nCinnamon Raisin Biscuits\n\nDough:\n\n2 cups White Lily all-purpose flour\n4 tsp. baking powder\n1/2 tsp. salt\n1/3 cup sugar\n1/2 tsp. cinnamon\n4 tbsp. shortening\n3/4 cup buttermilk\n\nFilling:\n\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon\n2 tbsp. vanilla instant pudding mix\n1 or 2 tsp. water\n\nFrosting:\n\n1 cup confectioners sugar\n1/2 tsp. vanilla\n1 or 2 tbsp. milk\n\nMix together the filling and set aside.  For the dough, in a large bowl add the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon.  Mix together thoroughly.  Add the shortening and cut in until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Add the raisins and buttermilk and mix until it forms a workable dough.  You may need to add more flour or more buttermilk to get it to work out right.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface, knead a few times until it is pulled together well, roll out the dough about 1/4\" thick.

Sleep great outdoors, or indoors where it will slide fully assembled under your bed. The Lounger delivers bedroom comfort but packs down to a tiny bundle 26\" long by 3\" diameter. Fits easily on your motorcycle or in a backpack or luggage. No airport delays bacause there are no metal parts to show up on the X-ray machine. \n\nThe polymer legs are super tough and will not crack in extreme cold or bend in the hot sun. The 12 legs distribute the weight to half the pressure of six-legged army cots. Or just slide the Lounger under your tent - it will slide under any tent even when staked down tight. Comfort is exceptional because the six patented suspension bows independently tension the breathable mesh fabric from head to foot. 26\" wide by 77\" long. Supports a 325lb sleeper. \n\nTakes only two minutes to setup and the side poles have hidden polymer hinges so you can instantly flip your Lounger into a camp table or lounge chair. No carry bag to add weight or get lost... all the parts roll up inside the fabric. No metal pieces anywhere; nothing to rust or corrode even in salt water at the bottom of your canoe. 10 Year Warranty.\n\nLuxuryLite Lounger Cuulz Bed / Cot\nhttp://www.luxurylite.com/cuulzindex.html\nEquip 2 Endure\nFree Membership @ http://www.Equip2Endure.com\nE2E Store @ http://equip2endure.mybigcommerce.com\nTwitter: @Equip2Endure\nFacebook @ http://www.facebook.com/Equip2Endure", "title": "LuxuryLite Lounger Cuulz Bed, Gear Test", "publishedDate": "2012-08-30T18:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oASfgQW9nE", "description": "", "title": "Vita De Vie - Praf De Stele (Florin Costea Cover)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T06:54:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3oAWMLgeLjo", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/user/midesarrollopersonal\nPERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND GOALS SETTING STRATEGIES - self discipline and time management - 10 keys to self development\n\nThis trailer introduces Personal Development Youtube channel.\nThis channel shows you how to set and achieve your goals and your dreams.\n\n\nATTRIBUTIONS\n\nauthor, title , Link, licence\n         \nRodrigo Soldon,  Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, https://www.flickr.com/photos/yaketyyakyak/8087260050, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/legalcode\n\nbluefieldphotos bp,  Graduation from college, https://www.flickr.com/photos/mckln/3503402285 , https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode\n         \nScott Cresswell, Just a face in the crowd, Https://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonupshaw/143316435/, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \nAxion23, Cars and Coffee Lineup, https://www.flickr.com/photos/wollombi/4018332326,  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \ndamien_farrell, 101_0811, https://www.flickr.com/photos/mossimoinc/16953691, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \nTambako The Jaguar, Venice from above, https://www.flickr.com/photos/seier/2982890199, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/legalcode\n         \nJohn_DL, Lamsing Beach, https://www.flickr.com/photos/gimpbully/2157129929, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/legalcode\n         \nBenson Kua, Lost.... , https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/6061818689/, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode\n         \n EladeManu ,  should i?  , https://www.flickr.com/photos/39388734@N00/11817910403,  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Amy Wilbanks  , 68/365: Bad Mommy, Morning   https://www.flickr.com/photos/sparkys/10253801046/in, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Scott McLeod ,  Question Mark Cookies 1  , https://www.flickr.com/photos/dendroica/7323421914,  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Robert Couse-Baker,   woman, thinking  , https://www.flickr.com/photos/vblibrary/5190554053, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode      \n madhan r  , No stone is too big ,  https://www.flickr.com/photos/katia_romanova/7756641062,  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Steve Jurvetson,   Magic Carpet Ride,   https://www.flickr.com/photos/dei3nascar8/59736915,   https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Robin Zebrowski ,  DREAM HOUSE,   https://www.flickr.com/photos/victorancheta/3634008191, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode\n         \n Roger Wollstadt ,  St. Thomas - Yachts in Harbor ,  https://www.flickr.com/photos/yachtfan/3575225549, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode\n\nThis video was created using the Imovie software.", "title": "PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND GOALS SETTING STRATEGIES - 10 keys to self development", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T18:24:52.000Z"}]
