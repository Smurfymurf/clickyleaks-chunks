What is it? What is the A/P process, and why is it important? http://www.bookkeeping-basics.net/accounts-payable.html\n\nTRANSCRIBED: Hello, I'm Stephanie Horne from Bookkeeping Basics and today I will be discussing Accounts Payable.\n\nSo first of all, what is accounts payable? The accounts payable is the account that is used to record the bills of a business that are outstanding and is also reffered to as A/P for short. \n\nThis is an account that should be added to your chart of accounts by the first time you enter a bill in order to properly track the money that your business owes to others. When when you enter a new bill, or you pay off your outstanding bills, you should enter the transaction in the register for your A/P account.\n\nThis process may or may not start with the generation of a purchase order when you purchase something from a vendor. After making the purchase you would then receive a bill from your vendor that you would enter into accounts payable so that you will be able to generate a report showing how much you owe, to who and when it's due. Then, you would eventually pay the bill so that it would not show up in accounts payable anymore.\n\nIt is important to use the Accounts Payable account properly in order to generate correct reports and be able to stay on top of cash flow. Quickbooks software makes paying and tracking bills using the accounts payable account nice and easy. Please come back next week and I will go over exactly how to do accounts payable in quickbooks.

Every now and then, as the universe offers its constant signs that we are beautiful beings, and I am reveling amongst the energy that we are so deeply encompassed WITHIN, I see my affirmations of the vision God has blessed every living being with. The ability to create. The gift of manifestation. The offering of a kingdom. But we must work to be rulers of our mind, it is our canvas in which the imagination is in it's truest form and your unique spirit holds the paintbrush that strokes your world into existence. Well, this is my kingdom, your kingdom, OUR kingdom. Let's live a life of revolutionary love, and create whatever we think of. May the things you think, manifest in the most magnificent form that it truly is. You're unique, embrace that shit & CELEBRATE YOUR MIND.\n\nA darker, more in-depth lyrical track with a spiritual ambience and thought-provoking imagery, 'AURA' was written to give a minor taste of the revolutionary wave that my soul currently vibrates on...and I hope you feel it.  \n\n\nMixed by @Mozenraff\nRecorded & mastered at @MHQStudios\n\n\n\n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI came up in a different light\nOoh babygirl, I can see your aura\nI know you wanted a reason to go pour up\nBut i got something' for the people more important\nTo LOCK OUT EVIL, the KEY, is to STAY OPEN\nSo I'm rolling something potent to keep you Focused\nOn what you can afford, cuz you got everything you need right in front of you\nSo look what's INSIDE of you and what that blunt'll do\nYou get it?

He received his higher education in Rouen where he worked as editor and freelance photographer in a local daily newspaper to pay for his studies. He worked briefly at the Viva agency and later joined the French Gamma in 1973 at the request of Raymond Depardon. During this same period, he married Michelle and their daughter Marie was born in 1975.\n\nIn 1975 he undertook two long works on subjects never before broached in France: the first \"L'Hopital\" was published in 1976; the second, \"Les Incarceres\", on French prisons was made in 1976 and published in 1983 with extracts from his personal journal written in the first person.\n\nIn 1977 he joined Magnum after he was noticed at the photography festival, Rencontres d'Arles, in 1976 by Marc Riboud and Bruno Barbey.\n\nIn 1984 he made his first film \"La Boucane\", which was nominated for a Caesar in 1986 for best documentary.\n\nOther often award-winning films followed, all broadcast by French and European television.\n\nThis same year, he started a cycle of winter voyages aboard so-called \"classic\" trawlers which continued until 1998 and led to the publication in 2001 of Pleine Mer.\n\nHis first trip to Iran was during the war with Iraq in 1986. He undertook ongoing trips there until 1997.\n\nIn 1987, he made the film \"Jean-Jacques\", spending two years chronicling the town of Octeville-sur-Mer, where he lived, through the eyes of Jean-Jacques who was mistakenly considered the \"village idiot\".\n\nIn 1994 he made his third film \"Marcel, pretre\" shot in Raulhac, Cantal and Auvergne over a period of several years.\n\nHe received the Prix Nadar in 2001.\n\nSince 2005 he has undertaken location scouting and shoots for the film \"Sous Marin\" spending four months underwater aboard a nuclear attack submarine.\n\nHe was officially named Peintre de la Marine in 2008.\n\nHis numerous works on human confinement have been coupled with a more contemplative photographic approach in recent years. In 2008, after his film aboard a nuclear submarine, he started photographic reconnaissance work that has already taken him from the arctic seas to the contaminated lands of Chernobyl and Fukushima. Concurrently, for the same project, he started a series of mountain landscapes and, in 2010, he received the prix Nadar (for the second time) rewarding the book \"D'apres Nature\" published with these pictures. The same year he was aboard the last and most modern submarine dedicated to nuclear deterrence.\nIn early 2012, he was in Fukushima and then again in the Arctic lands.\n\nHe has been living in Fecamp, Haute Normandie (Upper Normandy, France) since 1995.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/A1mE8WDO5nc", "title": "Great Photographer - Jean Gaumy", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T09:31:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1mIIlJo95s", "description": "Test Voil\u00e0 Voil\u00e0 \u00e0 Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne...", "title": "Chalon sur Saone", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T15:30:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1mT1v1g04Q", "description": "Bulbo africain(c\u00f4te au nord de l'equateur).Label mobile: une strategie de pollinisation!", "title": "Bulbophyllum saltatorium var saltatorium", "publishedDate": "2007-07-30T10:49:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1mbgDXag7c", "description": "We figure out how you can determine the structure of a crystal with diffraction!", "title": "Doc Physics - Intro to X-Ray Diffraction of Crystals", "publishedDate": "2013-03-26T14:08:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1mcJ8cCWJ0", "description": "Hello I will make a new video soon about why I have not been on.", "title": "My ag computer", "publishedDate": "2013-08-24T18:39:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1mgXJDaIMQ", "description": "Spunky is blind and has Cushing's disease.He was very ill,pot bellied  and weak.

Landlords do not need a reason to evict month-to-month tenants, and they can choose not to renew a tenant's lease without giving a reason. \n\nStep 3: Don't evict on your own\nDon't attempt to evict your tenant by force, or try to get them to leave by cutting off their heat or water, changing their locks, or tossing their possessions. These methods are all illegal. \n\nStep 4: Have a paper trail\nHave your documentation in order, including a copy of the lease, written notices you have sent to the tenant concerning any problems, and any other proof of your claim, like bounced rent checks or photos of property damage. \n\nStep 5: Give them fair notice\nLet the tenant know in writing that you are planning to evict them if they don't pay their rent or correct a violation by a certain date. How much time you must give them varies from state to state. \n\nTip\nIf you are evicting a month-to-month tenant without cause, make sure you are giving the advance notice required by your state, which can be anywhere from 20 to 90 days. \n\nStep 6: Go to court\nIf the tenant hasn't addressed the problem within the time frame cited, file an eviction notice with the local court. If the tenant doesn't respond within the time defined by the court, you win by default. If the tenant challenges the eviction, the case may go to a hearing. \n\nStep 7: Post a notice\nIf you win the case, a representative of the court \u2013 like a sheriff, marshal, or constable \u2013 will post a notice on the tenant's door giving them a move-out date, at which time the tenant and their possessions will be forcibly removed from the premises by the court representative if they haven't vacated on their own. \n\nStep 8: Cover their cost\nIf the tenant wins, you will have to let them stay and pay their costs of fighting the eviction, in most cases. So be sure to follow the letter of the law before starting proceedings! \n\nDid You Know?\nThe number of cases landlords filed in New York City for back rent rose 19 percent in the first two months of 2009.", "title": "How to Evict a Tenant", "publishedDate": "2010-03-11T13:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "A1nm_5OlSmE", "description": "Download the mixtape on Datpiff.com 9/7 - http://bit.ly/1cHWPCh\nPre-order the non DJ version here - http://bit.ly/HwDvOb\n\nA follow up to his highly successful 2012 mixtape debut Church Clothes, CC2 is hosted by Don Cannon (Drake, Lil' Wayne, J.Cole, Meek Mill, Wiz Khalifa, Wale etc.) features B.o.B., Paul Wall, Novel, Kevin Ross, Crystal Nicole, label mates Derek Minor and Tedashii, as well as production from Grammy Award winning producers David Banner, Street Symphony, Dirty Rice, Tyshane & Tha Inna Circle.\n\nProduced by Dirty Rice", "title": "Lecrae - Was It Worth It Ft.

http://bit.ly/1bmWO8h\nAuthorities in Washington state have confirmed that at least 14 people have been killed and more than a hundred have been reported missing after a massive mudslide in Oso. The cascading mud, possibly produced by recent heavy rain, slid across part of State Route 530 on Saturday morning. More than 100 properties in all were hit by the slide, 49 of which had a house, cabin or mobile home on them. At least 25 of those homes were believed to have been occupied year round, and 10 others were part-time or holiday homes. As crews continue to comb the rubble of Saturday's mudslide in Washington State, researchers are already looking into what specifically happened to cause the disaster. The slide in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains piled mud, boulders and rubble up to 5 metres in some places. It blocked the flow of the river, backing up water behind a natural dam left in the stream's channel that caused flooding of seven homes upstream of the slide. There are now worries that the volume and pressure of water behind the dam could build and lead to further flooding and mud flows. Rescuers are continuing to look for bodies but authorities say they are hoping that many of those reported missing would turn out to be survivors who were either double-counted or slow in alerting loved ones and local officials as to their whereabouts.

The cars solid panels were straightened and sanded until everything lined up just right and then covered in original Chrysler code GF3 Light Green Metallic and a gloss white Swinger stripe. Up front, a showroom fresh grille spans the entire width of the car and houses correct headlights and marker lights that function perfectly. On top of the hood, a Duster scoop, complete with chrome \"360\" emblems, sits on the cars central body line and provides an aggressive look that goes great with new for 1973 front end styling. The profile of the car combines the modern look of late 60s and early 70s design with fender lines that kick up right behind the doors to provide the classic 'coke bottle shape' introduced in the 50s. At the back of the car, ridged fenders flow into another broad show worthy chrome bumper which houses four great looking silver trimmed tail lights. This is one slick car that someone spent a lot of time perfecting. \n\nOpen the light green hood and check out the cars stout Mopar Performance 360 crate motor that has been completely disassembled and enlarged to 408 cubic inches. On top of the motor, a Holley 750 double pumper grabs air through a chrome air filter with a reusable filter element and sucks fuel from stainless fuel lines that are complete with a Summit fuel pressure gauge. That air-fuel mixture goes through a Mopar M1 single plane intake into Magnum R/T high flow aluminum heads that have been street ported, street polished and rebuilt with Manley stainless valves. The fuel is sparked by an MSD Blaster coil and Chrysler Electronic ignition system, which was new for 1973, and sends fire through Accel racing wires. Sportsman Racing Products pistons, rings and connecting rods combine with an Eagle crank and Clevite bearings to provide an 11.8:1 compression ratio. Exhaust gases then exit through coated TTI long tube headers into a 3 inch exhaust system equipped with Magnaflow mufflers. The engine bay is spotless and has been coated in body matching code GF3 Light Green Metallic which carries the same gloss as the cars exterior body panels. \n\nUnder the car a 904 3-speed automatic features a Coan Racing 3800 stall converter, a full reverse manual valve body and an auxiliary cooler mounted in front of the cars radiator. That tough transmission twists a custom driveshaft that is connected to an 8 \u00be limited slip rear end that houses Moser axles and Richmond Sure Grip 3.91 gears. Holding this awesome driveline into place is a factory torsion bar front suspension and a factory rear suspension with Mopar Super Stock leaf springs and adjustable air shocks. At the corners, a full set of Weld Pro Star wheels wearing 215/60 front and 235/60 rear BF Goodrich radials give the car a ton of attitude.\u2014\n\nThe restored to original Chrysler code D2F6 green vinyl bench interior is in great shape and shows little to no wear. There's a very informative Auto Meter Sport Comp tachometer on the column and a matching trio of Autometer gauges under the dash, but those are the only signs of progress from the driver's seat. The original dash shows no signs of weathering and houses correct gauges that are wrapped in correct wood applique. To the right of the gauges, an old school Sparkomatic deck sends sound to a pair of Panasonic 6x9's in the rear package tray. The dark green door panels are in excellent shape and feature only chrome door handles and chrome window cranks for ornamentation. The original steering wheel and original column are color matched to the dash and feature a chrome shifter for the 904 transmission and a correct green horn button. \n\nThis 1973 Dart is a solid build with a tight motor that is beautifully finished and would certainly cost two or three times our asking price if you wanted to build it yourself.

Police, Firemen, EMS, Ambulance Drivers, Security Guards all Gang Stalk in Bush/Obama's STASI GOVERNMENT GANG STALKING AMERICA.  They especially Gang Stalk at entries and exits.\n\nBush/Obama Turned First Responders and Neighborhood Watch Groups Into A Gang Stalking American Stasi\nhttp://youtu.be/y2vkyHBft_w\n\nThe FBI Refuses To Reveal The New Tactic (Government Gang Stalking) They Are Using in Illegal Surveillance  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryuBtW2I_EY\n\nPolice Admit Gang Stalking Exists But Not That They Do It\nhttp://youtu.be/MUGozZDfLSg\n\n\n11/24/2013 What It Is Like To Be Gang Stalked By Neighborhood Watch Groups & First Responders\n\n1. Pattern: The Gang Stalking starts the minute I leave my house.  I am Gang Stalked on my street with a Tactic Called Same Time Exit/Entry and/or at the End of My Street and/or as I exit my development via Buena Hills and/or at the Vista Way/Buena Hills intersections EVERY DAY FOR YEARS.\nhttp://youtu.be/p8DpUagGxOQ\n\n2. Daily Patterns: They use RED cars, RED trucks, Wear or Carry RED in Government Gang Stalking.  You are tracked with GPS.  They typically have a RED car pass in front of me as I exit my development.  One will come out of a side street on the next block.  One will be in front, in back or beside my car at the intersection of El Camino Real and Vista Way.  A Gang Stalker/RED car or person in RED will be at the intersection of Via Esmarca and Vista Way, another at the corner of Jefferson and Vista, another at the next intersection.  They'll have people in RED along the streets - often there are no other people or very few walking on the streets etc.\nhttp://youtu.be/WuZfyIaBzQ8\n\n3. Pattern: Here just before the Intersection of Vista Way and Via Esmarca you see a person in RED.  The important thing in Government Gang Stalking is ANCHORING.  People wearing RED are at the target's exits and entries - all along her route.  These are our Neighborhood Watch Group members who Bush/Obama have turned into an American Stasi.\nhttp://youtu.be/AunwGEf3rOY\n\n4. Gang Stalking behavior differs from ordinary behavior because of its repetition and duration.  Like clockwork - I will see a RED car in the exact same place you see this one every day as I come to this intersection.\nhttp://youtu.be/_414Z3rk3Mo\n\n5. Where do Government Gang Stalkers Gang Stalk?  On your entries and exits, at intersections, when you are walking on the street - they walk toward you, in back of you, on the other side of the street in RED, surrounding neighbors are enlisted in Gang Stalking the target to socially isolate her\nhttp://youtu.be/cWKqnZRdtLc\n\n6. This is the first time of 3 Carlsbad, CA police Gang Stalking me as I get out of my car for my walk with my handicapped brother today.  Police, Firemen, EMS, Ambulance Drivers, Security Guards all Gang Stalk in Bush/Obama's STASI GOVERNMENT GANG STALKING AMERICA.  They especially Gang Stalk at entries and exits.\nhttp://youtu.be/A29O6Xmzp6w\n\n7. This is typically what happens in Government Gang Stalking.  First a Carlsbad Police Gang Stalks me as I get out of my car for my walk.  Then a biker in RED comes by.  There is one after another of Gang Stalking in succession throughout my day, every day - going on seven years now.\nhttp://youtu.be/Ymhu_-TZMQk\n\n8. As I get out of my car to go for our walk on 11/24, 2013 one after another of Carlsbad, CA's GANG STALKING POLICE goes by/stalks.  The ACLU tells us illegal police surveillance is going on in over 30 states.  You can thank Dianne Feinstein and Mike Rogers who are responsible for oversight of our intelligence-industrial complex for what is going on.\nhttp://youtu.be/yrFTP4RkbTA\n\n9. Here we are going home and there is a RED car first in line at the intersection, but this is a pattern I saw all along our walk today and that I see everyday.\nhttp://youtu.be/HHZ3vsuZTWc\n\n10. As we walked along Carlsbad Village Drive on our walk today a GANG STALKING CARLSBAD Fire Engine passed in front of us as we were about to cross the street and here as we are on our way home, they GANG STALK again.  When I lived in New York I was daily Gang Stalked by Fire Chiefs in the Fire Chief SUV's from all surrounding districts and by Firemen from all surrounding districts in their Fire Engines.  Here in California I am Gang Stalked by Firemen in their Fire Engines and by EMS.\nhttp://youtu.be/HHZ3vsuZTWc\n\nI would like to stress I never say individuals in my videos are Gang Stalkers.  I am not a mind reader.  I do not know people's intentions.  I just show patterns I have seen every day for the last seven years of my Gang Stalking by our Sick, Corrupt, COINTELPRO-loving Government.", "title": "11/24/2013 What It Is Like To Be Gang Stalked By Neighborhood Watch Groups & First Responders 6/10", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T04:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "A29ahkPA9xY", "description": "Should you contribute to your daughter's engagement ring if you think her boyfriend is too frugal? \n\nFind out Wendy's advice in Ask Wendy!", "title": "Does Ring Size Matter?", "publishedDate": "2014-11-14T16:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "A29dXXca5uQ", "description": "", "title": "corixa y sus bellos recuerdos", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T06:01:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "A29sPHhnHcw", "description": "Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Music Gets The Best Of Me", "title": "Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Music Gets The Best Of Me", "publishedDate": "2009-06-10T15:30:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2AClY9sFyY", "description": "Plus sur http://wizdeo.com/s/telelyonmetropole . \n L'enqu\u00eate concernant le braquage du Bureau de Change de la rue de la R\u00e9publique, Global Cash, survenu vendredi dernier, est en progression.

In between installments of the Elder Scrolls Lore Series we'll be reading actual in-game books from around Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim; trying our best to bring them to life.  Today's Book is called \"The Amulet of Kings\", and it speaks of an ancient pact that leads to the events of the Oblivion Crisis.\n\n\"In the first years of the First Era, a powerful race of Elves called the Ayleids, or the Heartland High Elves, ruled central Tamriel with an iron hand. The high and haughty Ayleids relied on the patrons, the treacherous Daedra Lords, to provide armies of Daedra with dead spirits; with these fearless magical armies, the Ayleids preyed without mercy upon the young races of men, slaughtering or enslaving them at their whim.\n\nOn behalf of the suffering human races, St. Alessia, the first in the line of Cyrodiils, sought the aid of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, and the ruler of the noble Aedra. Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion, and to deny the armies of Daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\n\nIn token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal Dragonfires of the Imperial City. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic Amulet of Kings. The gem is the Red Diamond in the middles of the Amulet. This is the Symbol of the Empire and later taken as the symbol of the Septim line, It is surrounded by eight other gems. one for each of the divines.\n\nSo long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh and his divine kin maintain a strong barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, so that mortal man need never again fear the devastating summoned hosts of the Daedra Lords. But if the Empire should slacken in its dedication to the Nine Divines, or if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then shall the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedra realms fall, and Daedra-worshippers might summon lesser Daedra and undead spirits to trouble the races of men.\"\n\n- Wenengrus Monhona\n\nBook | http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amulet_of_Kings\nOur Elder Scrolls Blog | http://www.shoddycast.com/\nFacebook | http://Facebook.com/ShoddyCast\nTwitter | http://twitter.com/ShoddyCast", "title": "Elder Scrolls Lore Book: The Amulet of Kings (Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-09T21:03:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2FU9EMVzAk", "description": "www.samanthamadonik.com", "title": "Homogenization", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T04:26:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2FnUuhIEyY", "description": "All Copyright for the beat goes to Eminem \nBeginning Skit is from the TV show The Boondocks\n1st verse- Me (Reggie)\nChorus- I-Pot\n2nd Verse- I-Pot", "title": "Reggie Feat I-Pot- Counter Blow (Diss)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T20:48:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2FsORra0-A", "description": "Rising fighter Jeremy Carper knocking out Anthony Ford with a spinning backfist at VFL 32 Fight Night in the Valley, on March 26, 2011.

In spite of considerable investments by the federal government, non-profits and industry, the exact cause of MS remains unknown, there are no diagnostic laboratory tests available and there is no cure.  \n\nI hope you will take a few minutes this month, as you get together with friends and family, to talk about myelin repair and the hope it offers so many with MS for whom immunosuppressant therapies alone have failed to hold the disease at bay.\n\nAs recently as 7 or 8 years ago the prospect of myelin repair was pretty much science fiction. Over the last 4\u00bd years, our team of collaborative scientists has demonstrated in animal models of MS that myelin repair is a viable therapeutic strategy for multiple sclerosis. And with your support, we are investing in validating those discoveries for commercial development and creating a new level of interest among biotech and pharmaceutical companies in myelin repair.  \n\nIn 2004, we set out, within five years, to partner with a biotech or pharmaceutical company to develop a myelin repair treatment based on the discoveries made by our collaborative scientific team. Today, as the worlds largest medical research organization with a singular focus on myelin repair, we are on a direct course toward meeting this ambitious goal. In large measure this has been made possible by all of you.\n\nWe are grateful for your continued interest and support and ask you once again to share the MRFs story with your friends and family.

This was Carlin's \"first real book\" and contains much of Carlin's stand-up comedy material. According to the cover, the book contains \"jokes, notions, doubts, opinions, questions, thoughts, beliefs, assertions, assumptions, and disturbing references\" and \"comedy, nonsense, satire, mockery, merriment, sarcasm, ridicule, silliness, bluster, and toxic alienation\". For longtime Carlin fans, the book also contains complete versions of two of his most famous monologues, \"A Place for My Stuff\" and \"Baseball and Football\".\n\nThe hardcover edition was on the New York Times Bestseller List for 18 straight weeks. The following year, the paperback edition was published. It stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 20 weeks. Both editions were published by Hyperion.\n\nAs of January 2001, the book had sold over 750,000 total copies.\n\nWriter and television commentator Mike Barnicle supposedly lifted material from the book, without accreditation, and presented it as his own. He denied having read the book, but footage of Barnicle praising the book and saying \"There's a yuk on every page\" turned up. Barnicle was suspended for the action.\n\nIn August 1998, Hyperion published a 1999 calendar containing quips and quotes from the book.\n\nIn May 2000, the book was published as an audiobook by HighBridge, in both CD and cassette tape formats. The audiobook received a Grammy award, Carlin's third, in February 2001.\n\nSince there was a 3-year gap between the printed book and the audiobook, a few things were changed due to changes in both Carlin's personal life and in the world in general.\nHis wife, Brenda, died shortly after the book was published, so in the audiobook he said \"I've had a great marriage...\" instead of \"I have...\"\nHe mentions being happy the Yankees annihilated the Braves in the World Series in the book, but mentions it happened twice in the audiobook as the two teams played again in 1999.\nIn mentioning teams who could never quite win the big title after so many years, he mentions the Vikings, the Broncos, the Bills, the Cubs, and the Red Sox in the book. In the audiobook, he omits the Broncos when they win two Super Bowls.\nAt the end of his discussion of when super celebrities die, in the book he says he can't even fathom Frank Sinatra's or Ronald Reagan's death. He omitted Sinatra in the audiobook after he died in 1998.\nIn a non-chronological change, in his \"Baseball and Football\" segment, he adds the weird fact that baseball is the only one of the four major American sports that is sensably unwatchable in a mirror.", "title": "12 George Carlin - Brain Droppings cd1 - Mental Brain Thoughts", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T05:34:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2NyM2De8e4", "description": "UFC bantamweight champion T.J.

Our primary treatment for tennis elbow (and golfer's elbow, or medial epicondylitis) is the \"Tyler Twist\" method -- an eccentric (or \"negative\") exercise for the muscles and tendons of the forearm.\n\nWe instruct patients to perform 3 sets of 15 reps, with each rep lasting 4-6 seconds, daily for 6 weeks.\n\nThis eccentric-focused program helps in two ways -- 1) builds strength and joint support faster than a faster concentric rep, and 2) actually \"bulking up\" tendons, giving them greater tensile strength and therefore greater capacity to handle the loads that had been causing them to fail.\n\n-Daniel Bockmann, DC\n\nRead research on this treatment technique here: http://www.thera-bandacademy.com/elements/clients/docs/Tyler%20et%20al%20JSES%202010__201009DD_123442.pdf\n\nTo purchase a Flexbar (green works for most people), they can easily be found with a simple Google search for \"flexbar\".\n\nWas this video helpful?  \"LIKE\" it to increase awareness!", "title": "Tennis Elbow: Step-By-Step Instructions For Treating Elbow Pain Using A Flexbar (Tyler Twist)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T17:58:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2RJE5rdDDg", "description": "", "title": "Morristown Headquater Cinema Guy", "publishedDate": "2009-12-27T14:21:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2RemuUxB-E", "description": "Judge for yourself.

According to the Woese system, introduced in 1990, the tree of life consists of three domains: Archaea (a term which Woese created), Bacteria, and Eukarya. The first two are all prokaryotic microorganisms, or single-celled organisms whose cells have no nucleus.

Similar to Jawbone Jambox. Retails $49-$79. Available at NewEgg and other online retailers.\n\nArguably the best built and sounding bluetooth speaker in this price range. I listened to several at Best Buy and though could not make a direct comparison to this unit. I am confident if you were waffling between the Jambox and UE Mini Boom you will actually find this unit spot on. \n\nThis video is a short sample of the sound as captured  by a Nikon AW110 at close range. The camera though not perfect gives a reasonable sample of the frequencies output by this little speaker. I spin the speaker so you can hear the bass response from the back of the unit. The unit at a listening distance of three to five feet is quite smooth and clear. It is also not tiring as some small speakers are.  When listening it does benefit to have the unit against an object to project the bass forward. In an open room the unit does provide some bass response if you haven't destroyed your low end hearing with a giant kicker in your car trunk.\n\nListening and moderate volume is quite pleasant with this unit. I shudder at ice pick in the ear phone audio and am very prickly about balanced sound. The frequencies on this unit are well balanced not scoopy like the Jambox. \n\nIndie, and folk rock work well, Pop your can hear the parts clearly, Hip Hop is well defined but obviously lacks the low end of a larger speaker system. For personal listening when you don't want ear buds of headphones. This little speaker is inexpensive, well made and worth the $50. A big plus is this thing's giant battery will charge your phone too.\n\nI did not notice any bluetooth hiss or artifacts other than the typical bluetooth audio issues most are familiar with. It does come with a charger, bag, USB and 1/8 audio ribbon cord. And a STICKER! very cool.

It is the most powerful gland in the entire human body.  It has been nicknamed the third eye because it actually has rods and cones like the eyes, and can detect light and \"see\" deeper dimensions of reality.  Once opened, you will feel a buzzing or pressure sensation in the head.  Also, depending on how awakened it becomes, the more you can see down the \"rabbit hole\" of existence.  Soon you will see auras, energy waves in the air, and develop psychic abilities if you want.  Most importantly, the third eye MUST be awakened for you to experience the deeper spiritual truths.  You may believe that \"all is one\" or that \"the only moment is the present\" or what not, but until you've silenced the mind and/with the awakening of the pineal gland can you truly experience these truths and KNOW them.\n\nExercise is easy: sit in the sun.  Use the knuckle to rub a circle on the forehead slightly above and between the eyes. Do this for 2 minutes to activate the nerves in the brain.  Then close your eyes and look at the sun.  Direct all your consciousness to the center of the forehead and imagine using the third eye (center of forehead) to look at the sun.  You will soon see that the third eye can detect the sunlight and your mind's eye will be pure light.  Do this in silence or listen to nice music.  15-20 minutes a day and soon you will have an awakened pineal gland.  If you can awaken your pineal gland, it will change your life and how you see yourself and reality.  I guarantee it.\n\nAlso, for an advanced version.  Make it into a meditation.  During the meditation, intently listen to the sounds of nature. Just listen. Then focus on your breathing and control the breathing.  Whenever your mind wanders go back to listening and/or breathing.  With practice, you will be able to have all your conscious attention on listening while still being able to watch/control the breath.  It is kind of like the old exercise of patting your head while rubbing the belly.  The rational mind cannot focus on 2 activities at once, but by making two normally unconscious activities (listening and breathing) conscious you force yourself into a higher dimension of awareness.  Watch and see what happens.  \n\nPeace, \n\nmatt", "title": "How to awaken pineal gland.

It was a very racist time in the lives of Chamorros, as they had been handed from one colonizer to another, and while the rhetoric of one was better than the other, the treatment was still racist and paternalistic. Guam was ruled by a Naval Government which was not elected and Chamorros had no say or power in how their island and their lives were run. During this period, the Navy mandated their own morality in numerous absurd ways in order to mold Chamorros into proper subjects of the American empire.\n\nThe written history of this period notes, in the words of Marianas historian Don Farrell, that the Chamorros were good students when it came to these lessons in Americanization. This period is one in which the US is trying their best to lift Chamorros out of their squalor and Chamorro resist in some ways, but ultimately accept that America is needed in their lives to improve themselves. \n\nIn truth, Chamorros did not so easily accept the United States, especially not during the prewar colonial period. Chamorros saw the US as a colonizer, and as something which looked down on them and was constantly trying to control their lives. However, their resistance and their critiques were rarely written down or published. Much of their resistance was enacted or took form through songs. \n\nIn my Guam History class at UOG, I have my students divide into groups and each create a different \"resistance song,\" which hopefully takes from the lessons and readings and attempts to articulate what Chamorros would have felt at that time.", "title": "White Guys - Chamorro Resistance Songs", "publishedDate": "2010-12-23T04:24:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "A2rV0lQObek", "description": "Tracey takes a short winter holiday to Switzerland.

The Witness of John. John's Disciples Pointed to Christ. The Lord Calls His First Disciples. An Israelite Indeed.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the beginning was the Word, etc. The first fourteen verses are introductory. In order to set at rest all controversy the Divine nature of Jesus, John glances, in the first three verses, back to the beginning, recorded in Genesis, and affirms: (1) That he who was afterwards manifest as the Christ existed before creation began; (2) that he was present with God; (3) that he was divine; (4) that he was the Word; (5) that by or through him were all things made that were made (Joh 1:3). The first chapter of Genesis helps us to understand its meaning. God said, Let there be light (Ge 1:3), Let there be a firmament (Ge 1:6), Let the earth bring forth (Ge 1:11), etc. and it was done. God exhibits his creative power through the Word, and manifests his will through the Word. There are mysteries belonging to the divine nature and to the relation between the Son and the Father that we have to wait for eternity to solve. They are too deep for human solution, but this is clear: that God creates and speaks to man through the Word. As we clothe our thoughts in words, so God reveals his will by the Word, and when the Word is clothed in flesh, as the Teacher of men, we recognize it as Jesus Christ.\n\nWES: 1:1 In the beginning - (Referring to Gen 1:1, and Prov 8:23.) When all things began to be made by the Word: in the beginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings, the Word existed, without any beginning. He was when all things began to be, whatsoever had a beginning. The Word - So termed Psa 33:6, and frequently by the seventy, and in the Chaldee paraphrase. So that St. John did not borrow this expression from Philo, or any heathen writer. He was not yet named Jesus, or Christ. He is the Word whom the Father begat or spoke from eternity; by whom the Father speaking, maketh all things; who speaketh the Father to us. We have, in John 1:18, both a real description of the Word, and the reason why he is so called. He is the only begotten Son of the Father, who is in the bosom of the Father, and hath declared him. And the Word was with God - Therefore distinct from God the Father. The word rendered with, denotes a perpetual tendency as it were of the Son to the Father, in unity of essence. He was with God alone; because nothing beside God had then any being. And the Word was God - Supreme, eternal, independent. There was no creature, in respect of which he could be styled God in a relative sense. Therefore he is styled so in the absolute sense. The Godhead of the Messiah being clearly revealed in the Old Testament, (Jer 23:7; Hos 1:6; Psa 23:1,) the other evangelists aim at this, to prove that Jesus, a true man, was the Messiah. But when, at length, some from hence began to doubt of his Godhead, then St. John expressly asserted it, and wrote in this book as it were a supplement to the Gospels, as in the Revelation to the prophets.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMHC: 1:1-5 The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of God sent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, His existence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument. Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highest angel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.", "title": "Former Sceptic...

The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Crazy woman holds and handles a wild badger that may have diseases", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T16:50:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "A30QhjR093Q", "description": "A pregnant woman - in Britain on a business trip - was given a caesarean section against her will, and had her baby forcibly removed by social services.Sign up for Snowmail, your daily preview of what is on Channel 4 News, sent straight to your inbox, here: http://mailing.channel4.com/public/snowmail/remotebox.jsp\n\nMissed Channel 4 News?

They've entrusted you with their brand, and they're counting on you to reach a specific audience by sponsoring the right content. All you need to do is make sure your media buy lines up with their objectives. But in the free-for-all of online video, that's no small task. Because when you buy print or TV, you get specific metrics and data and targeting info so you and your client both know where those ad dollars go. But unless you're buying online video at one of the major networks, you have no way of knowing if that spend matches up with your objectives, or where it runs. \n\nSo maybe you try buying from a network. But the problem is, you can only see the publishers you're buying from, not their content. And THAT can get you in some hot water. If you were just spending a little money on a few videos, you'd just take the time to preview what you're sponsoring, but since you're buying at scale, that doesn't make sense. \n\nEpipheo Studios shows you how Affine gives you a clear picture of exactly what videos you're buying into so you know your spend lines up with your client's objectives. \n\nTo learn more, visit http://www.affine.tv/. -\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR FUTURE EPIPEHO VIDEOS\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=epipheostudios\n\nCHECK OUT SOME OF OUR OWN, ORIGINAL VIDEOS\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/epipheo\n\nLET'S BE SOCIAL TOGETHER, SHALL WE?\nhttp://www.facebook.com/epipheo\nhttp://twitter.com/epipheo\nhttp://gplus.to/epipheo\n\nEpiphanies Change Lives\nhttp://www.epipheo.tv\n\nTruth, Story, Love.\nhttp://www.epipheo.com", "title": "Affine Epipheo", "publishedDate": "2011-11-08T16:17:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "A36Mg9TaWYE", "description": "St. Louis Cardinals Chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. on death of Oscar Taveras:Cardinals family.

Nassif, of \"Dr. 90210\" and Spalding Drive Plastic Surgery in Beverly Hills, performs a Westernization (Ethnic) Rhinoplasty procedure with Weir incisions.\n\nMany different ethnic groups often have certain characteristics to their noses. Cookie cutter\" approaches to rhinoplasty rarely work well, and this is especially the case with non-caucasian nose surgery.For this reason, it is best to address the noses of various ethnic groups such as African Americans and Hispanics and Asians individually.\n\nThere are many examples of how this individualized approach offers the best outcome in ethnic rhinoplasty. For instance, many people of Asian and African and Latino descent have noses with wide bases and broad tips. They often also have thick skin at the tip of the nose. This can give the tip a rounded or \"bulbous\" appearance. Non-caucasian noses often also have a bump at the bridge, along with a wide and flat bridge.\n\nSome rhinoplasty and plastic surgery techniques are commonly used for African American, Hispanic, and Asian noses. The flatter noses common in many ethnic people can be addressed by grafting cartilage from elsewhere in the body to shape the skin of the nose's tip more finely, and provide it with a refined appearance. In some cases, the nostrils are noticeably wide and benefit from direct steps to narrow them during surgery.\n\nhttp://www.spaldingplasticsurgery.com", "title": "Westernization Ethnic Rhinoplasty for African American, Hispanic, and Asian Noses", "publishedDate": "2009-04-16T03:47:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3G5u229FlQ", "description": "Homeland Real Estate presents 9593 Charlotte Drive.

With the win, Florida State is the ACC Atlantic Division champion and secure a spot in December's ACC Championship game. \n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Florida State vs Miami | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-16T05:48:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3GRSMlIKyc", "description": "ALBUM: CUBAN SOUL (1976) POLYDOR", "title": "SAIA DESSA FOSSA - CASSIANO", "publishedDate": "2010-10-05T23:33:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3G_xPGN7CU", "description": "PAAAAAARTEEEY (again: fuck the rain)", "title": "Dismantle live @ Dockside, Outlook 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-09-08T18:10:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3GyUsrjpFA", "description": "Gosh... you'd think a pit bull with lipstick would be a bit tougher.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Ford GT spinning tires New  Car Donation", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:01:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3IexmOtOck", "description": "", "title": "Mitos y verdades sobre la pediculosis", "publishedDate": "2011-06-17T03:01:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3JC24p0YsA", "description": "\"A sleepy kitten wants a cuddle\"\n\n\nDon't forget to SUBSCRIBE!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=simonscat\n\n\nThe official Simon's Cat website and shop:\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.simonscat.com\nOfficial webshop: http://www.simonscat.com/Shop\n\n\nStay connected with Simon's Cat on your favourite websites:\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/simonscat\nGoogle+: http://plus.google.com/+SimonsCat\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/SimonsCat\nTumblr: http://simonscat.tumblr.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/simonscat\n\nThe Simon's Cat Extra Youtube channel for behind the scenes and tutorials: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/simonscatextra\n\nWhat software do you use?\nSimon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash.\n\nIf you want to email us:\ncontact@simonscat.com\n\nThank you for watching :)", "title": "Catnap - Simon's Cat", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T17:23:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3JPPIMW0Bk", "description": "The White-breasted Waterhen is a shy bird that would run for cover the moment it detects the presence of people nearby.

It has been tested in human studies with large dosages with no adverse reactions.\n\nThere has been some discussion about potential problems for:\n - people suffering from gallbladder disease as turmeric might increase gallbladder contractions.\n - or potentially those with diabetes on medication as turmeric can lower blood sugar. \n - or people on blood pressure medicine(turmeric might lower blood pressure). \n\nThese potential issues are not fact but it is best to talk with your medical professional before taking curcumin if you take medications for any of those health problems.\n\nLearn more about Apex Natural Curcumin 95, visit:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdiXIPZWebA", "title": "What Is Curcumin ?

The gastrocnemius is the larger muscle that is visible on the back of the leg, and the soleus is the smaller muscle that is lower down on the back of the leg and mostly underneath the gastrocnemius. Both muscles end up attaching to the heel via the achilles tendon and serve to point the toes down (plantarflexion). These muscles are vital in walking, running, and propelling the body. \nStrains in the calf come in varying degrees:\nGrade 1\n\u2022 Slight pain in the back of the leg\n\u2022 Zero to very slight restricted motion or activity\n\u2022 Tightness, aching, and slight pain for up to 5 days\nGrade 2\n\u2022 Pronounced, sharp, and restrictive pain\n\u2022 Swelling and bruising\n\u2022 Tightness and aching for up to 10 days\nGrade 3\n\u2022 Severe pain that is fully restrictive\n\u2022 Moderate to complete inability to restrict the muscles\n\u2022 Significant bruising and swelling\n\u2022 In the most severe cases (ruptures) the muscle is bunched up towards the top of the calf\nCalf strains occur due to injury during acceleration, change of direction, or repeated flexion under duress. The muscles may initially begin to spasm, cramp, or swell. Bruising may also become apparent at some time after the initial injury. \nTreatment of a grade I calf strain involves rest most importantly. Ice, elevation, and compression can reduce pain and inflammation, but should not be relied upon to continue strenuous activity. KT Tape provides excellent support for these muscles during unavoidable activity, reducing aching and tightness in the calf. This application also provides inhibition of the muscles to promote relaxation and healing.", "title": "KT Tape: Calf Strain I", "publishedDate": "2010-07-12T22:19:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "A3oEbLibo1k", "description": "http://www.organicseedsdirect.com/SeedsDirects-Provider-Bean-Seeds-Pack/dp/B007OCGBLY\n\nProvider Beans are easy and fast growing plants!\n\nPlant Info:\n\nProvider can be planted earlier than other beans because it germinates well in cool soils. Compact plants are easy to grow and adaptable to diverse soil and climate conditions. Produces 5 1/2\" fleshy round pod green beans. Purple seeds. Organically grown.\n\nGrowing Info:\n\nCULTURE: Choose well-drained soil with a pH above 6.0. After last frost date sow seeds about 2\" apart, 1\" deep, rows 20-36\" apart. Optimum soil temperature for germination is 70-90\u00b0F (21-32\u00b0C). Plant untreated seed when daytime soil temperatures average at least 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C), or risk poor germination. Inoculants can increase yields. For a continuous supply make successive sowings every 2-3 weeks through mid-summer. Dark-colored seeds germinate better in cool soil than white seeds.\n\nDISEASES: Plow under or remove and compost bean straw in the fall to hasten destruction of most disease organisms.

Set in Baltimore in 1954 at the birth of rock & roll, the film features Johnny Depp as Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker. Depp is pure charisma as a juvenile delinquent with a permanent tear slithering down his cheek, a reminder of his state-executed parents. In the depths of his despair appears goody-goody girl Allison (Amy Locane), who has a sexual crush on Cry-Baby. But Allison's Pat Boone-like boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen E. Miller), the leader of the squares, is dead set against Cry-Baby and the rest of the juvenile delinquents and leads a revolt against them. In the resultant riot, the juvenile delinquents are blamed for the chaos, and Cry-Baby finds himself dispatched to reform school.\n\ncry-baby,\"cry-baby clip\",\"cry-baby trailer\",\"cry-baby part 1\",\"johnny depp\",\"iggy pop\",\"susan tyrrell\",\"traci lords\",\"ricki lake\",\"kim mcguire\",\"darren e burrows\",\"jonathan benya\",\"scout raskin\",\"robert tyree\",\"john waters\",\"bucket videos\",\"dart videos\",\"muffler videos\",\"toy videos\",comedy,\"contemporary movie musicals\",\"cult comedies\",\"late night comedies\",musicals,\"spoofs and satire\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++11681,/m/0838fc,/m/0jfx1,/m/01whg97,/m/01l793,/m/018fyy,/m/02hmn8", "title": "Cry-Baby (2/10) Movie CLIP - Turkey Point is Open for Business (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:20:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4Dk_YlqHB0", "description": "Die im Kern auf eine gotische Anlage von 1401, m\u00f6glicherweise sogar auf einen Vorg\u00e4ngerbau zur\u00fcckgehende Kirche bildete das Zentrum des alten Bauerndorfes Feldafing. Sie wurde in den folgenden Jahrhunderten mehrfach erneuert, erhielt aber ihre heutige Gestalt erst durch die neugotische Umgestaltung 1896-98 von Prof. Schmid. Das Innere \u00fcberrascht mit einer in diesem Umfang im Landkreis Starnberg einzigartigen einheitlichen Ausstattung im Stil der Neuromanik. Der Raum wird von einem weiten Tonnengew\u00f6lbe \u00fcberspannt. Er wird durch marmorierte Pilaster gegliedert und stark von einer Dekoration in dunklen, kr\u00e4ftigen Farben bestimmt, die aus breiten B\u00e4ndern, aus textilen und floralen Mustern in den Zwickeln und Stichkappen sowie bildlichen Darstellungen in den Gew\u00f6lbefl\u00e4chen besteht. Der Hochaltar und die Seitenalt\u00e4re sind in Form eines romanisch-byzantinischen Kuppelhaus und in Form von Reliquienschreinen ausgebildet. Das Chorgest\u00fchl und das seitliche Oratorium entsprechen stilistisch. Die Kirchenb\u00e4nke stammen noch aus dem fr\u00fchen 18. Jh. Im Chor haben sich, in die Mauern eingelassen, noch acht Epitaphe der Garatshausener Hofmarksherrschaft erhalten. Von der ehemaligen Ausstattung mit Glasfenstern konnten noch zwei auf der Nordseite gerettet werden.

Generally it is suggested that the toilet be replaced entirely with a new model, but prior to doing that, there are a couple of things that should be checked before the old toilet is written off entirely.  \n\nFirst, check to see if the tank is filling with enough water to flush the toilet.  Sometimes the fill valve, or ball-cock supply valve, are adjusted too low, so the tank does not fill up with enough water.  If this is the case, generally the respective valve can easily be adjusted to fix the two-flush problem.\n\nWith the fill valve, simply slide the adjustment clip up until the correct amount of water is filled into the tank.  For the ball-cock supply valve, simply turn the adjustment screw counter clockwise allowing more water to enter into the tank.\n\nNext, check to see if there is adequate water supply to the toilet.  To do this, first check the water pressure in the house, which should be around 50 to 65 lbs per square inch.  Check the outlet on the angle stop to see if it is a 1/2-inch iron pipe connection. A toilet flush requires the additional water that enters the tank once the flush begins.  When the water supply lines are too small they restrict new water from entering the tank fast enough to aid in the flush.\n\nFinally, sometimes the toilet starts to flush but during the process is stopped suddenly by the flapper valve re-sealing onto the flush valve seat.  If this happens usually the flapper valve is not buoyant long enough during the flushing process.  Replacing the flapper valve should fix the problem.\n\nIf the tank is being filled with enough water, the water supply valve assembly is bringing the adequate amount of water volume into the tank, and the flapper valve functions properly, then usually the only other option is to upgrade the toilet to a newer, more efficient model.", "title": "How to Fix a Toilet - Diagnostics - Not Enough Flush", "publishedDate": "2011-01-04T18:39:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4JM-yPkFck", "description": "''NIQUE-LE'' DEUXIEME EXTRAIT DE L'ALBUM ''JE TROUVE PAS LE SOMMEIL ''\n\nSORTIE LE 08/12/14\n\nhttp://musique.fnac.com/a7277086/Jul-Lacrizeomic-CD-album\n\nSuivez l'actualit\u00e9 de JUL :\n\nSur Facebook : JulSaintJeanLaPuenta \n\nSur Twitter : @Jul_levrai\n\nSur Instagram : @Jul_levrai\n \nLA SEULE PAGE OFFICIELLE :\n-https://www.facebook.com/pages/JUL-saint-Jean-La-Puenta/300493316719391?fref=ts\nTOUS LE RESTE SONT DES FAKES LEQUIPE", "title": "JUL ( LIGA ONE INDUSTRY ) // NIQUE-LE // 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T19:32:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4JVz_jVDbE", "description": "SUSCR\u00cdBETE a este canal:\u00a0http://bit.ly/10nAF2t\nDescubre recetas nuevas:\u00a0http://cocinaycomparte.com/\nS\u00edguenos en Facebook:\u00a0http://www.facebook.com/CocinaAlNatural\nS\u00edguenos en Twitter:\u00a0http://twitter.com/cocinaalnatural\n\u00danete a Google+:\u00a0http://plus.google.com/117464414297243244897/posts\nS\u00edguenos en Pinterest:\u00a0http://pinterest.com/cocinaycomparte/\n\nEsta receta le invent\u00e9 porque me dol\u00eda tirar el bagazo de la pi\u00f1a cuando hac\u00eda mi jugo en la ma\u00f1ana.

In the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski was influential in the Cattle Dog's early development, and wrote the first standard for the breed.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog. It has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of this colouring and its practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \"Queensland Heelers\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.\n\nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog has a high level of energy, a quick intelligence, and an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years. Australian Cattle Dogs now participate in a range of activities beyond the herding they were bred for, including competing with their owners in sporting events and working as assistance dogs.\n\n\n\ngoogle+:https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/106818816560256164710/106818816560256164710/posts\naustralian cattle dog at work \naustralian cattle dog agility\n\nMusica gratis da strumenti di creazione youtube titolo brano :\n The Creek\ncute puppies cuccioli", "title": "Australian Cattle Dog Italia Allevamento Cuccioli", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T20:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4YvzpTe7iI", "description": "AHAHAHAHAHAHAH\nhttps://www.facebook.com/rebbekahlawesmusic?fref=ts", "title": "My Dad Doing The De-Articulator Challenge - Rebbekah Lawes", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T13:56:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4YyeBALE4Q", "description": "", "title": "reuni\u00e3o de condom\u00ednio - Minha M\u00e3e \u00e9 uma pe\u00e7a", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T16:34:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4Z7PUExhEg", "description": "Solo on \"Jesus Children of America,\" a Stevie Wonder tune. 11/3/07", "title": "Saxifrage - Jesus Children of America drum solo", "publishedDate": "2007-12-31T21:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4ZFW5_nEAo", "description": "I do not own the copyrights to this vid.", "title": "Everybody Hates Chris - Back Talk", "publishedDate": "2012-10-17T23:05:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4ZNUUCeXuc", "description": "I recently had 2 K wires removed from my hand.

For a view of these same clouds re-projected to a different perspective, see PIA12811 which adds a fifth frame with labels for Titan's lakes and seas.\n\nMethane clouds in the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, appear white here and can be seen moving east over several of Titan's large northern lakes. The darkest areas are lakes and seas of liquid methane, identifiable because they have a low albedo, meaning they do not reflect much light. (The difference in brightness and darkness on the surface here indicates a difference in composition.) The clouds seen near lakes and seas suggest that Titan (5,150 kilometers or 3,200 miles across) may have \"lake-effect\" clouds created by weather systems over large bodies of liquid. However, without earlier observations to show the clouds did not originate west of the large sea Kraken Mare, scientists can't determine conclusively if these clouds are \"lake-effect\" clouds.\n\nNear the beginning of the animation, a particularly large cloud can be seen directly over and east of Titan's huge sea, Kraken Mare, near the center top of the frame. If full, Kraken Mare, at 400,000 square kilometers (154,000 square miles), would be almost five times the size of North America's Lake Superior.\n\nEven if these clouds are not directly connected to the lakes and seas, scientists think that frequent detections of clouds at high northern latitudes since 2007 are related to the abundant availability of methane at the surface in this region.\n\nThe four images used in this animation were taken over a period of about 24 hours from Sept. 22 to 23, 2009.\n\nThese images were re-projected, and the view is centered on terrain at 49 degrees north latitude, 179 degrees west longitude. The north pole is near the upper right. The clouds are visible above terrain at about 60 to 82 degrees north latitude, 220 to 260 degrees west longitude. Scientists calculate wind speeds from about 0.5 to 10 meters per second (1 to 22 miles per hour), based on tracking of individual cloud features in these images.\n\nOther Cassini observations of clouds in Titan's southern latitudes provide evidence of a seasonal shift of Titan's weather systems to low latitudes from higher, south polar latitudes following the August 2009 equinox in the Saturnian system.\n\ncredit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute\n\nsource: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12812", "title": "Titan's Northern Clouds in Motion", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17T18:35:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "A4zY1Bwdhic", "description": "Dogs Parachute Solo [HD].

The film takes place in ancient times, when a mighty swordsman, Memnon (Steven Brand, making his film debut) ruled over nearly all the known world. Memnon, a brutal tyrant, defeats his enemies in battle with the help of a beautiful sorceress, Cassandra (Kelly Hu), who can predict the future. The last of the \"free tribes\" form a fragile alliance to fight Memnon, and hire a trio of Akkadian assassins, led by Mathayus (pro wrestler The Rock, who made his big-screen debut as this character in The Mummy Returns), to kill the sorceress and thus remove Memnon's advantage. Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan of The Green Mile), the powerful leader of the Nubians, objects to hiring mercenaries, but the plan goes forward. The assassins are betrayed by Takmet (Peter Facinelli), the son of one of the tribal leaders, and Mathayus finds himself unable to kill Cassandra. Thanks to the unlikely machinations of Cassandra, and the aid of a horse thief, Arpid (Grant Heslov of True Lies), Mathayus escapes to the desert. He eventually abducts Cassandra, who explains that Memnon was holding her against her will. Mathayus thwarts Memnon's efforts to re-capture Cassandra, then uses his newfound sense of justice to convince the surviving tribal leaders to join forces again to defeat Memnon. The Scorpion King was directed by Chuck Russell. Jonathan Hales (Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones) was credited with the story, and WWF owner Vince McMahon has an executive producer credit. The film, which was shot in the U.S. (very unusual for a big action film), reportedly underwent extensive re-shoots when the first cut came in with a running time of 70 minutes.\n\n\"the scorpion king\",\"the scorpion king clip\",\"the scorpion king 3\",\"the scorpion king 3 trailer\",\"dwayne johnson\",\"grant heslov\",\"kelly hu\",\"chuck russell\",\"bandage videos\",\"necklace videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",adventure,fantasy,\"josh mclaglen\",\"kevin misher\",\"stephen sommers\",\"richard luke rothschild\",\"vince mcmahon\",\"michael tronick\",\"caring videos\",\"compassion videos\",\"helping videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++260902,/m/0bsb4j,/m/014g_s,/m/03l7xc", "title": "The Scorpion King (6/9) Movie CLIP - Scorpion Venom (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:02:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A59UICbgPCQ", "description": "Removing Chip 40x50 mm on Table Type Horizontal Boring Mill (WFT 13 CNC).\nFor more information please visit us at below mentioned link\nhttp://www.fermatmachinery.com/wft-13-cnc", "title": "FERMAT Table Type Horizontal Boring Machine WFT 13 CNC - Removing Chip", "publishedDate": "2011-08-22T08:46:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "A59hb0SdIHc", "description": "NEW VIDEO for the 1.1.3 update HERE:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_i7tZiKEvo\n\nDemonstration video for the Radia LED Clock, on sale now in the Mac App Store.\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radia-led-clock/id411526265?mt=12&ls=1\n\nThe Radia LED Clock reinterprets the traditional analog clock for the digital age.

If your on a rowboat, speed boat, show boat, or a pontoon these tips should be useful.\n\n1. Always check your local weather service before you go out on the water. If for some odd reason your weather provider's prediction is wrong, look for darkening clouds, a temperature drop, or changing winds. Be safe and get off the water if a sudden weather change occurs.\n\n2. Make a check list before going out. We all forget stuff when we are rushing ourselves. Make a check list before you head out, it will ensure you don't forget anything important.\nSome marine safety supplies that might be helpful are a flashlight (click here to see video of  Safety Strobe Megaphone with flashlight), first aid kit, additional life jackets, visual distress signal, and an audio distress signal. All these supplies can be helpful in an emergency situation and can save your life.\n\nTo extend your voice even more look into a Portable PA System or a megaphone. These items would help you communicate to other boaters and safety professionals during emergencies or disaster situations.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the boating regulations, the layout of the lake, and the layout of your vessel. Knowledge of all theses things is beneficial. It will provide extra safety on the water for you, and your passengers.\n\n4. Put passengers to work. If you need help navigating or watching for other boats you could as your passengers to help you out.\n\n5. Get onto land or back into the boat as soon as possible if you fall in freezing water. Being in cold water steals your body heat 32 times faster then cold air. Find the nearest spot to get out of the water and swim there immediately. Treading water trying to make a decision can shorten survival time by 50%.\n\n6. Know how to swim. As crazy as it sounds, there have been incidences of people falling off their boat and not being able to swim. It would make sense to take a swimming class if your going to be around the water all day.\n\n7. Get a free vessel safety check. These are offered by the United States Coast Guard for free. You can find a local vessel safety check using this website http://www.safetyseal.net/GetVSC/. They check safety equipment and the overall condition of your boat.\n\n8. Watch out for the prop. A prop can spin 160 times per second so it's best to not board your boat via the drive unit. Get a ladder and board the safe way.\n\n9. Install a carbon monoxide device in your boats cabin.
