[{"_id": "AzCDKC06WLw", "description": "Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. It is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually involves the jaw and neck and then becomes generalized.\n\nClostridium tetani is a slender, gram-positive, anaerobic rod that may develop a terminal spore. The organism is sensitive to heat and cannot survive in the presence of oxygen.  The spores; however, are very resistant to heat and the usual antiseptics.", "title": "Tetanus: Clostridium tetani", "publishedDate": "2012-03-08T20:50:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzCJkBvV6JU", "description": "Instructions on where to find & DL this song below:\n\nPost a comment if the following info has helped you! \nThis video has been posted all over Youtube and everyone's looking for the song, so I thought I'd make it easier for you.\n\nTwo years ago I saw the same vid and here's what I found:\nSong is called Kutsat by a french band named FSB from their only album K\u00e8skispass (a play on the french phrase \"qu'est-ce qui ce passe?\" aka \"what's going on?\"). (Do not confuse them with the weird Bulgarian tecno-rock band called FSB).\n\nI have uploaded the song for free DL here:\nhttp://cid-fd5f35883d1b5313.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/kutsat.mp3\n\nYou can listen to their whole album and buy individual tracks here (although I'm unsure whether the band actually gets any royalties from this)\nhttp://mp3shopcart.com/Album/2003536/FSB/Keskispass/mp3/\n\nor from rapidshare for free here: http://www.riquedoreggae.com/2007/12/fsb-keskispass-2002.html\n\nDL the album cover here: http://cid-fd5f35883d1b5313.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/fsb^_keskispass^_album^_slip.JPG\n\nClearly, they're a bunch of surfers/boarders, apparently from Hossegor, France. They are disbanded now. One of their members, Tom Frager sings in the group gwayav'  http://www.myspace.com/gwayav\n\nAs for lyrics, I've created a page at LyricWiki http://lyrics.wikia.com/FSB%3AKutsat  Feel free to improve it.

Cause once youve put on this cd, you wont hear any electronic beats. No synths, no riffs and no rough edged melody either. No, this release is something completely different.

This Finnish pianist and church organist studied in Lahti, and was forced to take his first piano lesson at the age of five. The good thing was, he had to be forced to leave again after that one time he just didn't want to move away from that lovely black, grand piano. Petri: \"I just wanted to stay there, to learn, to play\". After continuing his study in the P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4meen Conservatorium in Lahti, he gave his heart to electronic music in the early eighties. After graduating in 1989 he continued studying at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where theoretic physics and musicology on one side, and house, acid and techno on the other side got his interest. He used every dime to buy synthesizers, sequencers and effect processors to learn about the music. With this Classical Trancelations project, Petri has abandoned his trustworthy, old collection of gear and has now reworked his favorite trance classics, like Energy 52 Caf\u00e9 del Mar and Armin van Buuren Communication into breathtaking orchestral compositions which all have their special touch . Whether you like your music emotional, joyful or sensitive, with Classical Trancelations youll have guaranteed listening pleasure. Just be sure youre prepared for a big dose of shivers.\n\nClassical Trancelations already received tremendous support by some of the biggest djs around.

The constant use of 'glissando' signals to the decaying of pitch centered materials, bridging or stretching clearly defined pitch/harmonic elements to their 'complementary' noise objects. Thus, the constant glissandi - seen in the first place as a mere functional attachment linking different musical objects- ends up as the main 'thematic' element of the piece, conferring to it a kind of \"sliding stability.\" These bridges or \"intervals\" dancing between diverse textural states, or musical objects, can also be linked to the idea of transposition - as in traditional harmony, when the mind tries to 'translate' different aspects of similar sound objects (they somehow \"repeat,\"  through contour throughout the piece) in a multitude of states or frequencies. As with my other pieces for acoustic instruments I was also attempting to make sense of the motoric/ergonomic apparatus of the viola, generating two parallel discourses or 'voices' : the first more attuned to the surface materials, their sequence and logical/illogical combination; the second - thought also as a generator of 'secondary thematic' elements - more concerned with purely motoric considerations (i.e. gestures, fingers' suitability, extended techniques, etc.) Thus, this piece is a superimposition of complex rhythmic materials and motoric patterns that friction between themselves 'sparkling' the compositional design.

Watch the whole video to see the amazing slow motion footage of this incredible fish! Filmed on a Canon EOS 60d in 720p with 50fps.\n\nThis was a temporary aquarium for the fish which was for sale and has now been re-homed.\n\nInformation about the Arowana (wiki)\n arawana are freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae, sometimes known as \"bony tongues.\" In this family of fishes, the head is bony and the elongate body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and the anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name 'bony tongues' is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the 'tongue', equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The fish can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into the swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue. The arapaima is an \"obligatory air breather\"\nThe family contains two subfamilies, Heterotidinae and Osteoglossinae, with all but two of the ten extant species being members of the latter. Species are given with one or more prominent common names. * Subfamily Heterotidinae o Genus Arapaima + Arapaima or pirarucu, Arapaima gigas (Cuvier, 1829) o Genus Heterotis + African arowana, Heterotis niloticus (Cuvier, 1829) * Subfamily Osteoglossinae o Genus Osteoglossum (Cuvier, 1829) + Silver arowana, Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (Cuvier, 1829) + Black arowana, Osteoglossum ferreirai Kanazawa, 1966 o Genus Scleropages + Red-tailed golden arowana Scleropages aureus \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003) + Green arowana or gold crossback arowana, Scleropages formosus \u2020 (Schlegel & M\u00fcller, 1844) + Gulf saratoga, red saratoga or northern spotted barramundi, Scleropages jardinii \u2021 (Saville-Kent, 1892) + Red arowana, super red arowana, or chili red arowana, Scleropages legendrei \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003) + Saratoga, silver saratoga or spotted barramundi, Scleropages leichardti \u2021 G\u00fcnther, 1864 + Silver Asian arowana, Scleropages macrocephalus \u2020 (Pouyad, Sudarto & Teugels, 2003)\n\u2020This species is one of several known also as the Asian arowana or Asian bonytongue.\n\u2021This species is one of two sometimes called the Australian arowana or Australian bonytongue.\nArowanas tend to merge in groups of 5 to 8; any fewer may show an excess of dominance and aggression. Keep this fish in a minimum of about 750 litres (240 gallons)for a single fish with good filtration, add another 100 for every other fish kept. This fish should not be purchased by an amateur fish hobbyist. Some compatible fish to partner with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, plecostomus, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gar and any other semi-aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana's mouth.\nAustralian species should be kept singly in aquaria\nOsteoglossids are carnivorous, often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; it has been reported that Osteoglossum species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (almost 2 metres) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname \"water monkeys\". Arowanas have been rumored to capture prey as large as low flying bats and small birds. All species are large, and the arapaima is a contender for the world's largest freshwater fish title. Arowana typically grow around 3 to 4 feet, but this is only accountable in captivity.\nSeveral species of osteoglossid exhibit extensive parental care. They build nests and protect the young after they hatch. Some species are mouth brooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth crazy to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.fish eating mice awesome intense monster arowana arowana arowana arowana aruanas, \narawanas, aruana, oscar arowana\n\nsee another arowana here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gQiRdh9Sac", "title": "Silver Arowana Aquarium Feeding Time", "publishedDate": "2011-04-02T17:47:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzcP_PagpyY", "description": "Vivaldi x TCN Partout KWPN approved stallion", "title": "Kirsten Brouwer with Eye Catcher - stallion - Prinsenstad 2013 show", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T19:16:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "Azccz2ZIf0Q", "description": "this is a new song and i love it, even though i come off pretty self-centred, but that's not entirely the idea. but i just have to accept the fact that people will use these songs whatever way they want to. so be it. \n\nthat and i'm a narcissistic aries.\n\nLYRICS\n\nthat i could be so cool\nthat you could be jealous\nit warms the heart\nyou wanna hate me but you cannot\n\nthat you could be so cool\nthat i could be jealous\nit warms the heart\ni wanna love you but i cannot\n\nbicycles\nlollipops\nsugar plums\nwhat's a sugar plum?\n\nunicorns that can mind read\nbooks and television shows about me\nit's all about me\n\nit's\nall\nabout me\n\ncause it's all about me\nthat's warped\nsentimentality\n\nsentimentality....\nthat's my mentality...\nsetimentality....\ncentral mentality... yadda yadda yadda.", "title": "Warped Sentimentality", "publishedDate": "2006-10-22T16:59:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzcqpLAto4Q", "description": "The Only Way Is Archway!!\nCustom made perfection by the boys  at ARCHWAY.", "title": "Archway Barbecue Skewer System", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T22:15:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzdVJ37NaSw", "description": "", "title": "Un cal a muscat o fetita de cap", "publishedDate": "2012-12-25T03:04:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "Azde-kROwDc", "description": "Die Minnes\u00e4nger Max und Mirjam de Vime singen Musik aus dem Mittelalter.\nFriedrich von Hausen war ein am Oberrhein beheimateter Ministeriale Kaiser Friedrichs I.

The woolly mammoth was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. M. primigenius diverged from the steppe mammoth, M. trogontherii, about 200,000 years ago in eastern Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant.\nThe appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal due to the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The animal was only identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.\nThe woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4 m (9 and 11 ft) and weighed up to 6 tonnes (6.6 tons). Females averaged 2.6--2.9 metres (8.5--9.5 ft) in height. A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges. Specimens could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through a combination of climate change, consequent disappearance of its habitat, and hunting by humans, though the significance of these factors is disputed. Isolated populations survived on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago, and on St. Paul Island until 6,400 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, and this tradition continues today. It has been proposed the species could be recreated through cloning, but this method is as yet infeasible due to the degraded state of the remaining genetic material. The ethics of such an operation have also been questioned.\n\nThere have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not extinct, and that small isolated herds might survive in the vast and sparsely inhabited tundra of the Northern Hemisphere. In the 19th century, several reports of \"large shaggy beasts\" were passed on to the Russian authorities by Siberian tribesmen, but no scientific proof ever surfaced. A French charg\u00e9 d'affaires working in Vladivostok, M. Gallon, said in 1946 that in 1920 he had met a Russian fur-trapper who claimed to have seen living giant, furry \"elephants\" deep into the taiga. Gallon added that the fur-trapper had not heard of mammoths before.[109] Due to the large area of Siberia, it cannot be completely ruled out that woolly mammoths survived into more recent times, but all evidence indicates that they went extinct thousands of years ago. It is likely that these natives had gained their knowledge of woolly mammoths from carcasses they encountered, and that this is the source for their legends of the animal.[110]\nLegends from several Native American tribes have also been interpreted by some as indicating folk memory of extinct elephants.[111][112][113] In the late 19th century, there were persistent rumours about surviving mammoths in Alaska.[109] In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his killing of a mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The museum denied the existence of any mammoth corpse; the story was a hoax.[114] Bengt Sj\u00f6gren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there still were living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.[109]", "title": "FOSSILIZED WOOLLY MAMMOTH", "publishedDate": "2013-06-29T00:27:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzhdzZRTrDs", "description": "Sorry I wanted to have this video out last week but I got busy trying to finish my prop for Fan Expo.

A prime example is the case of the root *k-, \"to like, desire.\" From it was derived a stem *kro-, from which came the prehistoric Common Germanic word *hraz with the underlying meaning \"one who desires\" and the effective meaning \"adulterer.\" The feminine of this, *hrn-, became hre in Old English, the ancestor of Modern English whore. In another branch of the Indo-European family, the same stem *kro- produced the Latin word crus, \"dear.\" This word has several derivatives borrowed into English, including caress, cherish, and charity, in Christian doctrine the highest form of love and the greatest of the theological virtues. \u00b7 Another derivative of the root *k- in Indo-European was *kmo-, a descendant of which is the Sanskrit word for \"love,\" kma, appearing in the name of the most famous treatise on love and lovemaking, the Kamasutra.\nThe American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright \u00a92000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.

Although it wasn't our first music clip (we'd previously made one for Mad Turks from Istanbul's \"Holding My Breath\") this one was tightly storyboarded, to the second, for the song recording. I still have the storyboards in a box somewhere. I recall that the mimed sessions were recorded using a betacam camera at an empty warehouse, with graffiti boards painted up by a bunch of young graffers as the backdrop of the set. I made all the animation on the amiga 1000s at UniSA using DPaint3, and these appear as overlays, and on the monitors on the set. Darren directed the performance and shoot. We used Loressa Clisby's home made dolly and crane for the jib shots, and I did the offline edit at Underdale (we had VHS dumps made with the timecode burned in). I still fondly remember the days of 5 and 10 second preroll at 2am in the morning - it was a moment of pause before the machines rolled into sync and \"dropped in\" the video track. The online edit was done at U-Tel. Looking back it was a pretty serious endeavour by everyone on a tiny budget, and considering the tape has been in a box for 20 years, its in not too bad condition.

But it is most famous as a source of light in different gas-discharge tubes. In daylight lamps the radiation of the glow discharge is absorbed by a layer of special substances applied to the outer surface of the tube, which, affected by absorbed radiation, start to glow. One can actually generate radiation similar to daylight by selecting such right substances (phosphors). If compared to conventional incandescent lamps, such bulbs consume a lot less power.   Gas-discharge tubes are also used for various advertising and decorative purposes, where they are shaped as different figures or letters. By filling tubes with various gases, one can get them to light up with different colors (neon would make them red, argon - bluish-green).  Gas-discharge tubes can be made to work off of low firing voltage, because the potential drop at the cathode depends on the material the latter is made of. For instance, in a neon bulb, electrodes are made of two iron leaves covered with a layer of barium. That's why, since the work function of the barium electrons is low, the potential drop at the cathode constitutes only about 70 volts. This makes the bulb light up already when connected to a regular lighting network. This kind of bulbs is used for alarm purposes in various kinds of equipment (indicator lights).  In the industry and laboratory practices the glow discharge is used in cathode metal sputtering, because the substance of the cathode bombarded by positively charged ions gradually converts to a gaseous state and settles as a metallic coat on tube's walls. Thus, one can achieve an even and hard metallic coat by placing various items in front of the cathode in glow discharge. This method is specifically used to manufacture high-quality metal mirrors. The method of cathode sputtering is also applied in atomic emission spectroscopy in order to conduct a layer-by-layer analysis of different materials.   However, the most important application of the glow discharge is found in relatively recently created quantum light sources - gas lasers.", "title": "Glow Discharge Applications", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T14:19:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AzuCEyZ7gOQ", "description": "Captain John with 25+ years of experience shows you the no-nonsense cruising skills you need for safer sailing worldwide.

He's nine years old and lives in Republic of Macedonia. He's also Microsoft Certified four times over and working on his fifth certificate. (And he prefers Bing.)\n\nThis is the type of story that warms your heart but also makes you feel a little bad about yourself. Why? Because still in his single digits, Marko is more computer literate than many of us will ever be. Here he describes his first memories of using a computer:\n\nBut my first memory is from when I was approximately 3 years old when I was making simple actions like personalizing Windows, then installing Windows, making remote desktop connections with workstations and servers on remote locations, and so on.\nAs someone who still struggles to get remote desktop working, that hurts. But still, good for the little guy, who has earned four certificates\u2014MCP, MCDST, MCSA and MCSE\u2014and is going for his fifth to become a Microsoft Certified Trainer. When asked about his plans for the next ten years, Calasan said he hoped to write Windows 7 instructional books for users of all levels. He also said that Bing is his preferred search engine.\n\nWhen asked if he preferred Windows or OSX, Calasan held back from indulging his literal inner fanboy, explaining, \"For everyone, the choice is different, so for me I use Windows because I am satisfied with its security, stability, scalability, productivity and many other good advantages of the Microsoft Windows operating system.\"\n\nThat diplomatic reponse to the enduring operating system debate might be an even more impressive display of precociousness than his certificates. [Network World]\n\nAccording to a report in the Times last week, Microsoft presented Marko with games and DVDs after he'd passed the exams, and although he considered it a nice gesture, he said he wasn't \"really interested in those things.\"\n\nMarko, who has a bent for mathematics and physics, was reading and writing by the time he was two years old, and by four he was speaking in English. In a video posted on YouTube (Macedonian), Marko explains that computing is a simple matter of mathematics and following instructions.\n\nThis simple understanding has made him into something of a local celebrity who has since been offered his own IT lab by the Macedonian Prime Minister, Nikola Gruevski.\n\nMarko's parents plan to publish a book for small children about computing based on Marko's experience and success.", "title": "Marco the child genius -  on CNN", "publishedDate": "2010-05-13T23:23:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-7pm4XBtwg", "description": "http://weightloss.freedownload101.com Lose thirty pounds successful thirty days using the Easy Drop Diet.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The parabolic microphone can capture distant sounds and voices that would otherwise not be heard.  It's the most versatile long-distance listening device around!\n\n With a parabolic sound-collecting dish encircling a patented mini-microphone, not to mention a built-in digital recorder, 10x-magnifying telescopic monocular and professional headphones, the parabolic microphone extends both your hearing and vision when you really need to know what's going on.\n\n You'll pick up sounds you wouldn't otherwise hear, anywhere from nature to your neighbors. The parabolic microphone can pick up sounds from 100 meters away or more.  Hear what the coach is telling the players from your bleacher seat or listen to a concert from the back row just as clearly as if you are sitting in the front row. Go on a nature walk to hear and see birds perched on distant tree branches. You can even eavesdrop on what your coworkers are saying about you in the parking lot.  There are literally hundreds of uses for the parabolic microphone!\n\n The headphones aren't cheap earbuds but rather the padded, ear-enclosing type of head phones that really isolate the sound you're trying to hear. Adjust the frequency controller dial to reduce unwanted background noise from traffic or crowds. A built-in digital recorder captures 15 seconds of sound at a time, which you can play back through the headphones and even transfer to an external digital recorder.\n\n You can also see the subjects you are listening to with the 10x prism optical system, so you're able to see the people you are viewing as well as listen to them.  These powerful viewing optics make subjects appear 8 times closer.  These features make the parabolic microphone the most versatile surveillance device!\n\n The dimensions of this unit are 11\" x 7\" and it weighs 1.9 lbs.  It requires one 9V battery to run.  The package includes 1 dish, 1 pair of headphones, 1 cotton cloth, and 1 English instruction manual.\n\n For more information please contact us at 1-800-282-1351.", "title": "Asianwolf's Sound and View Enhancing Parabolic Microphone  from asianwolf.com", "publishedDate": "2008-07-03T18:29:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-SnwdJU9eA", "description": "", "title": "Sweet Bay Leaf", "publishedDate": "2009-10-18T18:47:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-Sxv0vyPhg", "description": "simple method of emasculation and pollination in tomato to recombine traits (hybridization)", "title": "tomato hybridization", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T13:19:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-TF0xRMczY", "description": "Der Brasilianer Neymar vom FC Santos gilt als eines der gr\u00f6\u00dften Fu\u00dfballtalente seines Landes.

Much like the miners during the Gold Rush, dogs are territorial animals. They \"stake a claim\" to a particular space, area, or object by marking it, using a variety of methods at different levels of intensity.\n\nA more dominant male comes into the territory of a female who wags her tail and shows submissiveness to the dominant male in her neighbourhood. The other dogs pee to mark their territory. And what's with the backward kicking / scratching of the legs, eh?\n\nFor example, a dog may bark to drive away what he perceives to be intruders in his territory. Some dogs may go to the extreme of urinating or defecating on something to say \"mine!\"\n\nDogs don't urinate or defecate out of spite or jealousy. If your dog urinates on your baby's diaper bag, it's not because he is jealous of, or dislikes, your baby. The unfamiliar scents and sounds of a new baby in the home are stressing him out a bit and he feels the need to reaffirm his claim on his territory.\n\nLikewise, if your dog urinates on your new boyfriend's backpack, it doesn't reflect his opinion of your taste in men. Instead, he has perceived the presence of an \"intruder,\" and is letting the intruder know this territory belongs to him.\n\nSource: humanesociety.org\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Numerical simulations of the dynamo mechanism, such as this one, exhibit polarity reversals, whereby the north pole moves by 180 degrees; this mimics the behaviour documented many times within the geological record. Our simulation solves the equations of momentum transfer, heat transfer and electrodynamics in an electrically conducting and rapidly-rotating fluid at each point in time. High temperatures in the central part of the core drive thermal convection. The total simulation is equivalent to approximately 40,000 years on Earth. Our movie shows the magnetic field lines that enter and exit the core. High magnetic field strength is shown by red and yellow colours, and lower strengths by blue. On each field line we place a small compass needle with red and white ends, which orient itself in the direction of the field.\n\nAuthors: Jean M.

Undecisive, but when she makes up her mind, get out of the way or you're gonna die. \nReason: She believes that Soul Edge/Blade would get rid of her \"curse\", and coupled with her hard headedness, and grudge.. If soul edge doesn't kill her, or free her of her curse, she'll end the world. Simple as that. \nBackground: Arina used to have parents, but somehow, someway she forgot them over time. Arina was born with CIPA, a genetic disease, that takes away your ability to feel pain, heat, and cold. Because of that, she has multiple self-infflicted scars, that she caused without knowing. Since people didn't know about genetics at that time, they called her a demon, and banished her away. Even though Arina was strongly religous, she found comfort in the Occult, since she thought God had forsaken her.The eye bandana she wears is to hide her scar. She's not blind. She lived at a church, (ironic!), the priests felt pity for her, and gave her a job of ringing the bells.[Like the hunchback of Notre Dame! :D]One day, she overheard that Soul Edge had unearthed again, and went off to seek it. The priests tried to stop her, but in a struggle she accidentally killed them all. For two days, she mourned, and buried them, but still she went off to seek the sword, killing&&destroying whoever&whatever stands in her way, even if she never got used to murdering and slaughtering. Because of that, she's an emotional wreck inside, but she acts like its nothing. \nLOL it's long ;D SRY! :) im a perfectionist..\nBS Code:\n78da45cbb10e01411006e05dc725e788c8155a8f30b36b399542220a9d271867e52eb8625da3f4a67a8fa03106b1bbc97cfbcf8c524a27231d0f818f01b022830e5064d1396021a081492e3206a628b29c591187f95ce4107227ca0de047335e99bc6539b333951425052a1a1fd460f9e37843571f12ad93beee2c9e8fc75d29d5e6fbffdcd6fcbaa9ce4aaac2b6a4bd8f465457676afc8a0adf1a1e4ed4acb917a59786c3b8cfa5de637a0874f6710483ef742b93fe7b294e77a7aa3e663222414fbf00185a43ed", "title": "Soul Blade Entry: Arina", "publishedDate": "2009-02-07T01:00:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-bqvinIiyg", "description": "DIANA JONES @ CC DE BREUGHEL, BREE - 14/03/14 T10", "title": "DIANA JONES @ CC DE BREUGHEL, BREE - 14/03/14 T10", "publishedDate": "2014-03-15T12:50:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-cJCO0HYnM", "description": "Kevin Vandam shows Extreme Angler TV viewers how and why he uses the \"new\" Strike King Baby Burner spinnerbait to blast more bass on the tournament trail.", "title": "Spinnerbait Savy with KVD", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T03:55:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-cL3HCSYPE", "description": "This is for promotional use only, all rights reserved to the dialectic, I do not own this music", "title": "THE DIALECTIC - No God", "publishedDate": "2012-09-01T01:13:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-d3q2juVqU", "description": "Shafi ur Rehman Laughing", "title": "Khowar Funny", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T10:36:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-d8Cdiwlg0", "description": "After 9\" of rain in less than a day, the spadefoot toads came out to take advantage.

Why would she believe those lies? Why would she accuse me? \"\n\n** Justin's still sick while Aly's gotten better; a rumor about Jalyson had spread through the school  **\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlyson's POV:\n\nThe day has been rough on me. Even teachers gave me certain looks and hesitant eyes. I wanted this to be over. I wanted to crawl underneath my bed covers and lay down forever. After some explaining, Nicole understands the truth and thinks the rumors are, \"A load of crap,\" she had said. Now we sat in the cafeteria table having lunch, but I was too lost in thoughts to care about food. \"Hey girlies,\" Rosa, a cheerleader, settled her plate on our table and scooted next to Brittany. Nicole was sitting on my right whereas Sophia sat on my left. \"Hello,\" I said weakly. The last thing I wanted to do was talk to anyone.\n\n\"Hey, Aly.. Umm... Is Justin good in bed?\" she winked. My eyes shot wide and solemness overtook my anger. I bet I just sat there, frozen like a statue. Her comment just completely threw me off the edge, even though I've been receiving stuff like this ever since this morning. \"Shut up, Rosa,\" Nicole scowled, making me snap out of my thoughts. \"Will you girls.. Excuse m-me for a second?\" I gulped, standing up from my seat. I could feel the tears building up in my eyes, but I had to hold them back. I stormed past everyone, who had their eyes on me, until I reached the girl's bathroom. After locking myself into the end stall, I let the tears flow out as if they've been aching to see the world.\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this?\nSpecifically what have I done wrong?\n\nI could hear the faint sound of girls giggling outside - in the hallway. It was a bit muffled, but only an idiot wouldn't be able to figure out they were, indeed, talking about me. My whimpers suddenly turned into small sobs as I seriously pondered getting out of here.\n\n\nJustin's POV:\n\nI glanced at the clock again. It was 4:31pm and I was just eager to see Aly already. She was supposed to come back right after school and I'm getting a bit worried. Suddenly, there was a bang at my door, making me jump. \"Come in,\" I coughed. The figure of Alyson appearing into my room made me smile. But it didn't last. My smile instantly dropped when I realized the expression she wore. It looked as if she had been crying.\n\nWhat happened?\nWhat's making my Aly cry?\n\nShe walked over to me and laid down next to me on the bed, cuddling herself in my arms and resting her head on my chest. I brushed the lock of hair that crossed her face and planted a kiss on her cheek. \"Tell Justin what's wrong,\" I urged soothingly, caressing her cheek and constantly placing kisses on it. She was whimpering slightly, letting out slow sobs. When she opened her mouth to explain, it was almost unbearable. She told me everything - everything that's being said about us. The false rumor that's making her shake uncontrollably. She even handed me a note some guys had given her - all having their numbers written to call for 'blow-jobs.' It made me absolutely furious.\n\nAlyson's a sweet girl, she isn't used to this kind of hate. Hell, she doesn't DESERVE this kind of hate. If whoever started the rumor hates ME, they should stay focused on ME, not Aly. And I bet you I know who started all this. It must be Ryan.. It only makes sense. But I'll have to deal with him later. I'll have to confront him when I'm back on my feet. But as of right now, I have a crying Alyson I should worry about.\n\n\"I can't take it,\" she cried out. \"Alyson,\" I murmured. I leaned so close to her that our lips were centimeters away. \"I'm here for you, I'll protect you. Trust me, I can fix this,\" I whispered in her ear. Another thing I've learned, thanks to my mom, is that if a girl - or even a little child - is scared, the best thing you can do is stay calm. Or at least ACT like it. And right now, with Alyson, it seems to be working. My calm, soothing voice is making her settle in my arms. Gently, I place another kiss on her cheek and rest my head in hers.\n\nRyan Butler, I swear, I will personally strangle you with my own hands, you low-lifed douchebag.\n*********************************************************\nNext is 129!\n\n1) Do you think Ryan started the rumor?\n\n2) N'aww, doesn't Justin handle situations so well?\n\n:)", "title": "Lost Love - A Justin Bieber Love Story - Episode 128 (Seaso", "publishedDate": "2012-05-27T22:10:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-dg0JxbIaQ", "description": "", "title": "\u3052\u3063\u3061\u3085\u5c4b\u7248Lump of Sugar\u904b\u547d\u7dda\u4e0a\u306e\u03c6unmei senj\u014d no phi OP", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T15:36:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-dlc8W-V_w", "description": "Zene: Ullmann Ott\u00f3:\nSz\u00f6veg\u00edr\u00f3: G.

Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.

Pink noise (noise with equal energy in every octave) was played through the control room speakers.  The output was monitored with a real time analyzer, and a graphic equalizer was adjusted so that the frequency response for the room was flat.  This process had some drawbacks in that the room response was dependent on the playback volume.  Also, having more or fewer people in the room, changed the frequency response as well.\n\nLEDE is an acronym for live end dead end room design.  It doesn't use the equalizer to tweak the room response.  Instead, it presumes that any frequency response anomalies are actually produced by standing wave patterns.  So the LEDE control rooms attempt to eliminate these standing waves.  To do this, the end of the room with the monitor speakers has all soft panels and carpet, making it the \"dead end\".  The other half of the room has bare floors and hard walls, making it the \"live end\".  \n\nSound travels from the speakers to the mixer's position and then reflects off the back wall and travels past the mix position again and is absorbed in the soft surfaces of the dead end.  The key to the LEDE design is to time-delay or diffuse the returning wave, so that no standing wave patterns are created.  Doing this successfully means that the recording engineer hears what's actually being recorded.", "title": "LEDE Room", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T11:43:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-xfBmjoTzo", "description": "homecoming queen with cerebral palsy", "title": "homecoming queen- bellflower high 2010", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T02:49:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-yGjdbU2mQ", "description": "Reportage Media Plus", "title": "DELIBERATION SECOND TOUR BAC.flv", "publishedDate": "2011-07-26T15:04:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-yOtAlwpE0", "description": "", "title": "YRLLOW BUSH PENSTEMON", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T20:29:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-yRjEKy69o", "description": "The Whitest Boy Alive @ Ancienne Belgique - Bruxelles, le 14 avril 2009", "title": "Promise Less or Do More", "publishedDate": "2009-04-27T22:37:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "B-yeUbP3fIw", "description": "Nasreddin was a Seljuq satirical Sufi, believed to have lived and died during the 13th century in Ak\u015fehir, near Konya, a capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, in today's Turkey.

Once more, ritual killings of children and others are being used by politicians who hope to increase their luck before elections. There is someone found dead and mutilated somewhere in Gabon every 1 to 2 days. The killing of young Catherine, 4 years old, in late October 2013 reminded us of the brutality of ritual crimes against children.The phenomenon has increased dramatically since President Ali Bongo's fraudulent elections in 2009.\n\nPeople of Gabon have asked corrupt President Ali Bongo, for too long, to do something about ritual crimes. He made promises to end them during a mock propaganda march with his wife in May 2013, in response to Anonymous pressure. Nothing has happened.\n\nRitual killings are fueled by elections and greed. People are killed and mutilated for elections that will be full of fraud anyway. In local elections taking place in Gabon, we see once again the refusal to create a transparent election. Many multiple listings were found in the electoral register. Gabonese challenged the presence of many foreigners as candidates in local elections. Many candidates are members of the Bongo family, including Ali Bongo's mother. The Bongo family has been ruling Gabon for more than 46 years and their fraudulent elections are accepted by the international community.\n\nGabon is an oil rich country with one of the highest GDP's in Africa, but over 80% of the 1.5 million Gabonese live below the poverty line. The majority make less than US $2 per day. According to Yahoo Finance, Ali Bongo and his associates pocketed 25% of Gabon's GDP in the last 3 years with the help of his international supporters. In the meantime, Ali Bongo authorizes force with tear gas to be used against children of young as 10 years old, protesting for better schools and the return of teachers to class.\n\nInternational oil, banking and infrastructure firms are supporting this terrible regime in Gabon: Total, Shell, Perenco, Tullow Oil, Sinopec, Vaalco, Citigroup, Bank of America, BGFI, Axa Insurance, Bollor\u00e9, Bouygues, Petrolin, Bechtel, New York Forum Africa, just to name a few. Some of the banks (Citi, HSBC, BOA) have been implicated in fraud and money laundering with the Bongo family and their friends. Accountants and lawyers in developed countries are helping as well.\n\nAll the big money and corruption is fueling ritual killings because those ordering the killings expect them to bring money and power. The United Nations, including UNICEF, is doing nothing to help children being slaughtered in Gabon. Gabon is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The UN is not doing enough to denounce ritual crimes publicly.\n\nThe people of Gabon are fed up. They are tired of being tortured and eaten by the very politicians who are stealing their livelihood. They are tired of the international community praising the Bongo regime for the benefits his greed brings to their corporations.\n\nAnonymous has lost patience with the Bongo regime and his enablers.\n\n#OpGabon is Re-Engaged\n\nWe Are Anonymous.\nWe Are Everywhere.\nWe Are the voice of the Voiceless.\nWe Are Legion.\nTyrants of the World,\nExpect Us!\n\nFOLLOW: https://twitter.com/OpGabon\nVideo Creator: https://twitter.com/TheAnonReporter\n\nAnonymous is for Freedom\nhttp://www.facebook.com/OffiziellAnonymousPage\nhttps://twitter.com/AnonymousPage1\nWe are Anonymous,\nWe are Legion.\nWe do not forgive.\nWe do not forget.\nExpect us.", "title": "Anonymous - Operation Gabon [URGENT PR]", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T19:12:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0-wrng6Ru8", "description": "Footage from external operations conducted in Zambia and Mozambique during the Rhodesian bush war with music by Nic Pickard.

The wage cap at Chicago Lake remains $10.50 despite high profitability & unsafe conditions - workers asked for cap up to $13/hr, then some got fired. National Labor Relations Board complaint filed.\n\nFirst picket 4.6.2013: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37N73QAcQr8\nBoth picket videos shot & edited by Steve Onderick - Video courtesy Snow Arch Films - http://snowarchfilms.com Thanks!!\n\nAlso notice it is April 13th & there is new snow - yes it snowed 4.12 & 4.13 but does that stop the Wobs? HELL NO\n\nVIA IWW.org: http://www.iww.org/en/content/iww-liquor-store-workers-fired-union-activity\n\nAlthough workers had been discussing forming a union and acting for better conditions in their workplace for almost a year, the event will mark the first time any of them publicly declare their IWW affiliation. This declaration and action comes on the heels of the firing of five union employees--Hallie Wallace, Arella Vargas, Max Specktor, Davis Ritsema, and Joe Giwoyna--shortly after they presented a petition signed by the majority of the shop's workforce asking for a dollar raise and elevating its $10.50 pay cap to $13 an hour. In January, the workers also turned in a petition asking for holiday pay.\n\n\"If there's anywhere that needs a union, it's a store like Chi-Lake,\" said Wallace, \"Despite the immense amount of money that we bring in, our wages are incredibly low. We have no paid sick days or holiday pay, scheduling is inconsistent, and we put up with unsafe working conditions and sexual harassment on a daily basis. We've come together to demand respect and dignity on the job for everyone working at Chi-Lake, and they've responded with nothing more than aggressive union-busting.\"\n\nAt the picket, the workers and supporters will make clear their demands, which are to rehire those fired illegally, provide raises to all employees as initially asked, and that management stop union-busting.\n\nIn addition to the picket action on Saturday, the five fired workers also filed Unfair Labor Practices with the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nLINX\nhttp://twincities.iww.org/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/twincities.iww\nhttps://twitter.com/TwinCitiesIWW\nGeneral Defense Committee https://www.facebook.com/TC.GDC?fref=ts\nhttp://tcorganizer.com/\nhttp://tcorganizer.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/brokenbottle.jpg", "title": "Chicago-Lake Liquor IWW Picket Round 2 4.13.2012", "publishedDate": "2013-04-14T06:19:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "B04aLLWLJnA", "description": "", "title": "Responsibilities Of A Paraprofessional Classroom", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T03:36:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "B053WHFUAh8", "description": "Treating Tetracycline", "title": "Purple Grass Male Guppy (Treating Tetracycline 1st Day)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T04:34:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "B05Y45NWFCA", "description": "Independent TriVita Affiliate Member Corie Wallace #13067395 visit http://www.nopalea-superfruit.com Nopalea and Trivita present the 10 Essentials for Healthy Living, Wellness, Peace and Joy.

We all want to be happy. Nobody gets up one day and says, 'let me take the formula of depression. I've spent countless years happy, I need a change.'\n\nNobody says that. Everybody wants happiness. And if we look at those who spoke about happiness, we find that some of them said that happiness was in the attainment of financial standing or material wellbeing. Some of them said happiness was in the attainment of many children for example. Some of them said happiness was in having a handsome or pretty spouse. \n\nBut if we really research those who got what they wanted and thought was happiness, we find that they never really attained the formula of happiness. They might have attained a portion of what gains happiness, but in terms of attaining happiness and its formula, in its totality, then they did not most definitely attain it. And they would testify to this themselves. Allah in his book given that Islam is the complete way of life and has taught us everything good and warned us against everything bad, has indeed taught us the formula of happiness. Allah says...\n\nLaa ilaaha Illallah\n\nListen to this, Allah says, 'for the one who does good deeds from both the males and the females and they are believers...then for them  Allah will give a resilient life, a happy life, a fulfilling life. And the price of living a life full of good deeds is not restricted to happiness in this world, rather it follows on into that which is known as 'the perpetual life'. May Allah makes us one from amongst those happy both in this world as well as the Akhira. Ameen!\n\nSo this here, O servants of Allah is the formula of happiness.", "title": "The Formula Of Happiness \u1d34\u1d30 \u2507 Islamic Reminder \u2507 by Sheikh Sajid Umar \u2507 TDR Production \u2507", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05T18:32:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0G_YnNVJzU", "description": "Record released on October 14, 1967.

Help us identify this particular species. Is it a Trollius acaulis (stems are too long/tall for that!) or another buttercup family member such as an Anemone?\n\nAmarnath cave is a famous shrine in Hinduism located in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is dedicated to Shiva. The cave is situated at an altitude of 3,888 m (12,756 ft), about 141 km (88 mi) from Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir and reached through Pahalgam town. The shrine forms an important part of Hinduism, and is considered to be one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism. The cave is surrounded by snowy mountains. The cave itself is covered with snow most time of the year except for a short period of time in summer when it is open for pilgrims. An annual pilgrimage is made to the Amarnath cave by lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of Hindu devotees on challenging mountainous terrain to see an ice stalagmite formed inside the cave. The Amarnath cave has been a place of worship since times immemorial. There are references to one Aryaraja (32BCE-17CE) who used to worship a lingam formed of ice in Kashmir. The book Rajatarangini refers to Amareshwara or Amarnath. It is believed that Queen Suryamathi in the 11th century AD gifted trishuls, banalingas and other sacred emblems to this temple. Rajavalipataka, begun by Prjayabhatta has detailed references to the pilgrimage to Amarnath Cave. Other than this, there are further references to this pilgrimage in many other ancient texts.\n\nThe temple is a popular yatra destination for some Hindus. In 2011 it received about 634,000 persons, the highest recorded number for the site. The number was 622,000 in 2012. Pilgrims visit the holy site during the 45-day season around the festival of Shravani Mela in July--August, coinciding with the Hindu holy month of Shraavana. The Amarnath Yatra is organised every year by the J &K Govt. during the month of sharavan (July and August); the dates however, vary every year looking at the weather conditions and according to Purnima (Raksha Bandhan) in the month of Sharavan (Vikrama Samwat). Yatra to Baba Amarnath Holy Cave for which one has to trek a height of  about 14,500 ft  is full of thrill and joy .The  feeling  of divine which is always beneath  ones' heart ,  burst out and one realises 'Moksha'  as one attends  the Cave   and   perform the  prayer  before the  Shivlinga . Surrounded by beautiful valleys, mountains , one  will  always  feel  His presence on the paradise of the earth, the memory of which hardly vanishes with time a  journey  which  will  rediscover the nature and its love  which  is always  inside but one has never felt. \n\nDevotees travel on foot, either from Srinagar or from Pahalgam. The latter journey takes approximately 5 days. The State Road Transport Corporation and Private Transport Operators provide the regular services from Jammu to Pahalgam and Baltal. Also privately hired taxis are available from Jammu. The shorter northern route is just about 16 km long, but has a very steep gradient and is quite difficult to climb. It starts from Baltal and passes through Domial, Barari, and Sangam to reach the cave. The northern route is along the Amarnath valley and all along the route one can see the river Amaravathy (It is more like a tributary of Chenab) which originates from Amarnath Glacier. En route to the cave, various non-profit organizations set up food supply and resting tents called pandals which are available for free to the pilgrims. Near the shrine, hundreds of tents which are erected by locals can be hired for a night's stay. Helicopter services from base camp to Panjtarni (6 km from the cave) are also available from various private operators.\n\nSource: Wikipedia & www.amarnathyatra.org\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

So let's recap.  We previously told you that Marvel had laid claim to May 6th, 2016 and May 5th, 2017 for two yet announced movies and now we've learned that they have also set July 8th, 2016 for another mystery movie.  So which movies have the most potential of hitting the big screen?  We'll probably get confirmation at this year's Comic-Con, but that doesn't mean we can't do a little speculating in the meantime. Phase 2 started off strong with the release of Iron Man 3 in May.  That film went on to join the billion dollar club and is currently the fifth highest grossing film of all time.  Next up will be Thor: The Dark World on November 8th, followed by Captain America: The Winter Soldier on April 4th, 2014, the one new entry Guardians of the Galaxy on August 1st, 2014 with the final Phase 2 film being The Avengers 2 arriving on May 1st, 2015.  Phase 3 will begin with Ant-Man on November 6th, 2015. So what other movies will join Ant-Man in Phase 3?  We're guessing May 6th, 2016 will bring the long discussed addition of Doctor Strange to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Of course, after the release of Ant-Man, Marvel may not want to gamble on another origin story and may hold Doctor Strange for the July 8th spot and save May 6th for a sequel.  We know that Robert Downey, Jr. has signed on for The Avengers 2 and 3, but is most likely not planning to do another solo Iron Man film, so the next logical candidate would be Thor 3 or possibly another solo Hulk film.  A third Captain America movie is possible, but less likely since part 2 will be out in 2014. For the May 5th, 2017 release, there are several possibilities.  The studio could be saving another Thor, Hulk, or Captain America movie for then or attempt to introduce a new character with Black Panther being the most likely candidate. Other options could be reintroducing characters they recently reacquired the rights to like Ghost Rider, Daredevil, Punisher or even Blade.  Another big possibility could be that May 5th, 2017 will bring us the release of The Avengers 3.  This would leave them only two years between Avengers 2 and 3 and would mean Phase 3 would consist of only 4 films instead of the 6 and 5 that Phase 1 and 2 had, but it would make it easier for the studio to lock in the cast. So now that you know our theories, what movies do YOU think will comprise Marvel's Phase 3 and do you think we could see The Avengers 3 hit theaters in 2017?

Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and on most smaller land masses \u2014 exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific. More than 20 families are currently recognized, comprising about 500 genera and about 3,400 species. They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to the Reticulated python of up to 8.7 meters (29 ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 meters (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.\nWorld's Biggest Snake NEW 2013 world's biggest snake found alive not Dead NEW Video Giant Huge EVER, the world's biggest snake found alive!!!

Snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica, in the sea, and as high as 16,000 feet (4,900 m) in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia.\nThe two infraorders of Serpentes are: Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia.This separation is based on morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity. Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of \"colubroid\" snakes (colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and attractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia. While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi. safdeejay1, World, snake, the biggest, huge, the World's Biggest Snake! world's biggest snake found alive not Dead NEW 2013 Video, world's biggest snake found alive, youtube, world's biggest snake ever caught, world's longest snake on record, world's biggest snake prank, red sea, world's biggest snake, species, world's biggest snake in history, world's biggest snake caught, world's biggest snake in iran, huge snake, malaki ahas, New, Found, Record, big snake, attack , 2013, 2013, python, World's Biggest Snake NEW 2013 world's biggest snake found alive not Dead NEW Video Giant Huge EVER \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0lKkH5vCls", "title": "TOP World's Biggest Snake NEW 2014 world's biggest snake found alive not Dead Video Giant big snake", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T10:39:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0lqgu3wvFE", "description": "http://www.pearlypenilepapulesnyc.org/   (212)-644-9494\nPearly Penile Papules\n\n\nA 19-year-old man was referred for treatment of multiple papular lesions that had appeared 8 years earlier on the glans of his circumcised penis and had been diagnosed as condyloma accuminatum. The lesions did not respond to treatment with various topical wart preparations. The patient reported no history of sexually transmitted infections and was anxious and embarrassed by the lesions. A genital examination revealed multiple tiny, smooth, skin-colored papules (arrow), distributed circumferentially along the coronal sulcus of the glans penis. Pearly penile papules are asymptomatic acral angiofibromas, typically distributed circumferentially on the corona and sulcus of the glans penis. They are more frequently found in men after puberty, with a reported incidence rate as high as 35 percent. This normal variant is seen more commonly in black and circumcised men. Familiarity with such anatomical variants, which may resemble various dermatoses, helps to relieve anxiety in patients and prevent unnecessary treatments.

We show that these are indeed massive sesamoids that employ a patchy mode of ossification of a massive cartilaginous precursor and that the predigits act functionally like digits. Further, we reveal clear osteological correlates of predigit joint articulation with the carpals/tarsals that are visible in fossils. Our survey shows that basal proboscideans were relatively \"flat-footed\" (plantigrade), whereas early elephantiforms evolved the more derived \"tip-toed\" (subunguligrade) morphology, including the predigits and fat pad, of extant elephants. Thus, elephants co-opted sesamoid bones into a role as false digits and used them for support as they changed their foot posture. \n\nSupporting Online Material Video\n\n- Movie S1\nFoot anatomy of an extant elephant (Elephas maximus; specimen #4 in table S1).

In case you are not familiar with the term, this is someone who can assist you during the transaction by providing much-needed advice, document preparation and working out all of the settlements. There are several things you should know when dealing with conveyancers, and they are highlighted below.\n\nSolicitors Are A Great Choice\n\nIt is not necessary for the person who you hire to be a solicitor, but that would be a great choice. Since a solicitor will know all of the ins and outs involved with conducting real estate transactions, you can avoid any trouble. You may end up hiring someone else to do the work, but you should consider several solicitors before you do that.\n\nBe Perfectly Honest\n\nThis is not a time when it would be in your best interest to hold back. If there are any particular things you would like to have done, or you have some time constraints that would require a speedier process, you should be open about this from the beginning. If you hold back and the transaction does not end up how you expected it to, you will be the only one to blame.\n\nOrganization Membership\n\nOne thing that is true of people in all industries is the fact that qualified professionals like to stay current. Part of this process is remaining an active many of industry organizations. When you are on the hunt for a conveyancer, make sure that you ask about membership in the Australian Institute of Conveyancers. If you are told that they were never a member or they are no longer, this is a sure sign that you should probably select someone else.\n\nFees\n\nAs with any other real estate transaction, there are fees involved with hiring a conveyancer. You cannot expect anyone to work for free, yet you would not be very smart if you settled for paying more than necessary. The best way to get a fair deal is to contact several providers and ask about the fees that they charge. Weed out the ones that are far too expensive and the ones that are far too low. Choose one of the candidates that offered moderate rates.\n\nCommunication\n\nSince this person is conducting a deal on your behalf, it is important that they stay in touch with you. There is no reason why you should hire someone then struggle to reach them by phone and/or email. During the initial meeting, you should ask about the frequency of communication. Anyone that cannot offer you an estimated frequency of contact needs to be crossed off of your list.\n\nEducating yourself before you go out to hire help is an important part of the process.

Forced into action, Billy vows to change his drunken ways. He enrolls in kindergarten, makes new friends, pelts pint-sized kids with playground balls and develops a love interest in a pretty teacher (Bridgitte Wilson). The action culminates in an academic showdown between Billy and the purportedly Harvard-educated underling for the future of the family enterprise -- no small feat for a man fresh out of the first grade. There's gross, moronic, off-color low humor galore in Billy Madison, particularly in one subplot involving a romantically forward elementary school principal (Josh Mostel, son of theater great Zero Mostel) and his secret former life as a professional wrestler; another scene includes the hypertense school bus driver (Chris Farley, in a typical over-the-top cameo) lying in the meadow with a hallucinatory penguin. As one might suspect, Billy Madison is not for every taste; Sandler fans will laugh from start to finish; others beware.\n\n\"billy madison\",\"billy madison clip\",\"billy madison back to school\",\"billy madison part 1\",\"adam sandler\",\"norm macdonald\",\"darren mcgavin\",\"bradley whitford\",\"bridgette wilson\",\"larry hankin\",\"mark beltzman\",\"robert smigel\",\"jared cook\",\"theresa merritt\",\"james downey\",\"shane farberman\",\"michael ayoub\",\"tamra davis\",\"boot videos\",\"pie videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++134372,/m/0gcxdqk,/m/08hrqs,/m/0h0_6m,/m/01x0kg7,/m/03r6xv,/m/0pz91,/m/02lk1s,/m/0335fp,/m/0817fc,/m/05p5m7", "title": "Billy Madison (8/9) Movie CLIP - The Academic Decathlon (1995) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T20:25:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0vY69FdrP8", "description": "Classic slab bouldering problem at the climbing area of Bas Cuvier in Fontainebleau, France.\nClimber - Lance Finlay", "title": "La Nescafe 6A Bas Cuvier - Fontainebleau", "publishedDate": "2013-01-12T15:20:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0ve-hGC2VU", "description": "Zene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piLI_60uru0\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/M4RKDINOKING", "title": "Slender Brothers", "publishedDate": "2014-01-19T20:17:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0vlQQLPV0o", "description": "Genre: Brutal Death Metal/Grindcore", "title": "Blister Germinal - The Sculpture", "publishedDate": "2011-05-23T18:34:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0vvmQYRsHY", "description": "", "title": "tek pnek kon peal kmeng slot \u1797\u17b6\u1782\u200b3", "publishedDate": "2014-01-03T08:51:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "B0vyF821rC0", "description": "Excellent condition.

Is that so wrong?\n\nFrom original designer Al Lowe (designer of all of Larry's classic adventures) and writer Josh Mandel, Replay Games is remaking the landmark first game for a new generation. Expanded and enhanced in every detail and ready to rock your PCs. Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is being reborn for those of you who might've seen your parents (or grandparents!) playing Larry behind closed doors.", "title": "Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T10:22:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "B187mux_Rbo", "description": "dermovate cream for sale URL:\nhttp://bit.ly/Ho3PJJ\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n Kseroderma pigmental is innate chronic skinning disease: pigmentation, shelushenye, cracks, yz'yazvlenyya, warty 20 gm  excrescences, \n On the second stage we conduct the massed antybakteryal'nuyu, anti-virus and betamethasone valerate ointment  protyvogrybkovuyu therapy against the exposed \n us that at psoriasis great number of dermovate crema  reasons.\n In this case, additional to kryosaune, laser \n Mykrosporyya (clipping lichen) is betnovate rd cream  dermatomykoz of man.\n Such analysis we do by all patient, rather than just 20gm  that, whom psoriasis of head is exposed at.\n steady \u00abspots\u00bb are not (psoriasis 20 gm  of head, for example) give up, we use the special kryofen, to which betamethasone valerate ointment  already aiming we \u00abshoot\u00bb tailings of illness.\n\n more frequent on the back surface dermovate crema  of neck, back, person; sometimes develops because of confluence of a few furuncles.\n\n betnovate rd cream  A similar eczema often is investigation of allergic dermatitis, when at combing \n 20gm  After 15-20 minutes wash off by cool water, after smear \n of group 20 gm  In and etc Symptoms of atopycheskogo dermatitis\n 3 soupspoons of seed of fresh betamethasone valerate ointment  cucumber inundate by a 1 glass of vodka and leave on 12 hours.\n dermovate crema  For treatment of diseases of skin, and also plenty of kosmetologycheskoy \n Stafylokokk betnovate rd cream  at the loosened immunity, broken exchange of matters causes a furuncle.\n\n itch and 20gm  knot pouring out.\n\n Removes the edema, hyperemia, itch in the place of causing.\n 20 gm  (eczema) is inflammation of superficial layers of skin of nervously-allergic nature.\n\n An effect betamethasone valerate ointment  will not compel itself long to wait.\n\n Unburdened pyodermyty is this follykulyt and dermovate crema  osteofollykulyt.\n Often seboreynyy dermatitis arises up at the loosened people on a background betnovate rd cream  the sharp decline of immune defence.", "title": "betamethasone valerate ointment and dermovate crema.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T12:51:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "B18IaaSkoNk", "description": "SITE - LOJA\nhttp://www.atallaescapes.com.br/\nRUA SOUZA LIMA 209-BARRA FUNDA-SP\nFAN PAGE - KLEBER ATALLA ESCAPES\nwww.facebook.com/kleberatallaoficial\nKLEBER ATALLA.\nCAIXA POSTAL 62572 CEP 01214-970", "title": "KLE621 FULL HORNET RED METALIC ESCAPAMENTO ATALLA QUEBRANDO TUDO NO SERRA AZUL.N\u00c3O TEM PRA NINGUEM.", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T20:25:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "B18Wh9VmGt0", "description": "Chica de FaceBook- Gigo\n\nEdici\u00f3n: Natalia Plazas\nCamara: Camilo Plazas", "title": "Chica de FaceBook- Gigo", "publishedDate": "2013-03-03T16:42:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "B18XGed2L4c", "description": "Saija-Maria Saari, Lapuan Virki\u00e4.", "title": "It\u00e4-L\u00e4nsi 2013: Saari oli kent\u00e4n paras - \"L\u00e4nnell\u00e4 pitk\u00e4t perinteet\"", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T17:43:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "B18bZSzydaQ", "description": "Mr.Fraud is an Upcoming Heist Movie Starring The Complete Actor Mohanlal in the Lead, Written & Directed by Unnikrikrishnan B, Produced by AV Anoop...\nMusic Composer - Gopi Sundar", "title": "Mr fraud malayalam movie Theme song", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T11:25:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "B18wNVKCwiM", "description": "Dan Gable delivered one of the most memorable Olympic performances ever in 1972 but it almost didn't happen...\n\nWatch the PREMIERE of \"The Voice Versus: Dan Gable\" July 11th on AXS TV!", "title": "The Voice Versus: Dan Gable - 3 Seconds Almost Changed History", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T23:58:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "B1999H7v8nE", "description": "DL This Song! http://georiot.co/2F7r\nTweet this Battle! http://clicktotweet.com/cbUYe\nSeason 2 Voting: http://bit.ly/1acgkPz\nSign Up 4 Gamefly Free! http://www.gamefly.co.uk/ad/track/cmju510?redirectURL=\n\nRap Battle Episode 30:  RYU VS SCORPION\n\nIt's Street Fighter vs Mortal Kombat in the deadliest Rap Battle yet- Ryu vs Scorpion!

With Reid Mihalko from http://www.ReidAboutSex.com and Cathy Vartuli from http://www.TheIntimacyDojo.com.\n\nCathy: What is the difference between disappointment and rejection? Knowing that difference can make your life a lot easier, and we'll be going into that in just a minute. This is Reid Mihalko\u2026\n\nReid: From http://ReidAboutSex.com, and this is Cathy Vartuli\u2026\n\nCathy: From http://TheIntimacyDojo.com. Reid, what is the difference between rejection and disappointment?\n\nReid: I don't know. Why do you always ask me the hard questions? I'm supposed to know these things? It's crazy.\n\nCathy: Well if you don't know them, then people might reject you.\n\nReid: That would be disappointing. Oh, we're good! The difference between ... well I mean for me, rejection is somebody says no to you, and you attach a whole feeling to it. You make it mean something about you, you've been rejected, not like being rejected in basketball, like something about you wasn't, didn't meet up the standards and you die. It feels like you're dying.\n\nCathy: It triggers the primitive brain which wants to belong, and feel part of and worthy.\n\nReid: And disappointment is people, when people say no, or you don't get to have something that you want, you're just disappointed. Like \"Oh, I don't get to have that.\"\n\nCathy: Right.\n\nReid: It means nothing to your well-being or who you are as a human being, or you're not going to die because of it.\n\nCathy: Yes. It doesn't affect your self-worth on a fundamental level.\n\nReid: Mm-hmm (affirmative) and the self-worth is coming from you. You're the one who's making it mean something that it probably doesn't mean. We as adults, like we say in Cuddle Party, you know, the little kid who's on the tricycle who's going around the playground inviting everybody to ride in the back of the tricycle, everyone says no to that kid, but the kid just keeps running around and inviting people, because the kid's having a blast. They're not making it mean something about themselves to an extent that they're not really even disappointed.\n\nCathy: That is possible about many things, but rejection can hit very hard. If you feel that hurt on that deeper level, get some support and learn to detangle your self-worth from other people saying yes to you. That will give you a lot more freedom and ease as you move forward.\n\nReid: Reject rejection. That's what you need to do.\n\nCathy: If you come back, we'll be doing a video on how to handle disappointment a little bit more. In the meantime, leave a comment below and tell us about your definition, how you define the difference between rejection and disappointment, and like our channel, subscribe.

I bring these containers in the house before a frost comes. Since I do not use chemicals & I don't want to bring bugs into the house, I treat these plants with a watering & spraying of soapy water.  I do this thoroughly, letting the water run through the bottom of the pot. I then let the plant set in my garage for a week. Giving it less sun light and water. After a week I give it another dose of the soapy water routine.  Then it gets placed in the house in my south facing windows. When it starts looking 'ratty' I take it down stairs by a small window that gets light but no sun.  I let them go dormant for while. Watering them barely, maybe monthly. March it comes back up into my south windows, pruning it back very hard. Back outside in May/June. These two plants are 5 years old. Next year I will take cuttings & start some new plants.  Just in case these die, I don't want to be without it.

Burning the midnight oil in order to meet the submission deadline.\n\u201cMany thanks indeed for all your hard work on the film \u2013 we think it\u2019s great and showcases The Higgins Bedford superbly\u201d  said Jo Roberts, Head of Learning and Access, The Higgins Bedford\nLet\u2019s hope that our small contribution helps the Higgins onto the short list and maybe even further!!  We would urge anyone to visit the Higgins, it really is superb.\n\nThe Cecil Higgins Museum, as it was formerly known, opened its doors to the public on 25th July 1949, housed in the former Higgins family home. The Museum was founded by the philanthropic brewer, Cecil Higgins (1856-1941) to house his collection of ceramics, glass and objets d\u2019art for the benefit, interest and education of the inhabitants of, and visitors to, Bedford. Cecil Higgins left a complex will to protect his collection which stipulated how the museum was to be organised. He also left a trust fund, to be used for museum purposes, but principally for acquiring works of art.\n\nOver the years collecting policies shifted focus, moving from decorative arts to watercolours, furniture and prints. The period between 1952 and 1964, under the curatorship of Margaret Greenshields, were the most productive in terms of collecting watercolours. Over 500 were acquired in twelve years. In 1971, following the appointment of Helina Graham as curator, the collecting policy switched back to the decorative arts, with the purchase of over 200 pieces from the Handley-Read Collection including the William Burges furniture.\nFrom 1988, the focus returned to collecting prints, this time concentrating on the 20th century. The print collection now numbers over 400 pieces, including works by some of the finest British artists as well as internationally renowned figures such as Picasso, Lichtenstein and D\u00fcrer. The collection charts styles as well as print processes, from Whistler\u2019s delicate etchings to Edward Bawden\u2019s magnificent linocuts. The last major addition to the print collection was a generous donation in 2004 from the Scottish artist Alan Davie (1920 \u2013 present) of over 70 prints, as well as five works in gouache.\n\nIn the 1970s the former Higgins & Sons Castle Brewery buildings became available. John Turner was appointed Curator in 1974 and he led the transformation of the brewery buildings into the new town museum, which opened its doors to the public in 1981. The museum was merged with the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery in 2005, but both buildings remained essentially separate until the museum closed for redevelopment in October 2010 and then The Higgins Bedford reopened on June 21st 2013.", "title": "The Higgins - Art Fund film", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T14:51:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "B1yCBBvrcTY", "description": "HNNNGGG\n\nNisemonogatari, episode 3", "title": "Blushing Senjougahara", "publishedDate": "2012-01-25T00:00:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "B1yVnKHrbgU", "description": "\"Anthropophagus\" is the shocking tale about a cannibal on a small island.\nIt became the most famous movie from Joe D'Amato and it's one of the sickest and goriest movies ever made.\nA disgusting classic in it's own right!\n\nFor listening purpose only, like the other soundtracks I am uploading...", "title": "Anthropophagus Soundtrack 01 - Main Theme Padre Snaturato", "publishedDate": "2009-04-12T11:12:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "B1yh5CtVebY", "description": "", "title": "Breaking kneecap", "publishedDate": "2009-09-06T17:18:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "B1yxRy1J0JY", "description": "You need a license to drive a car.

Thank you for joining us. Today let's talk about part three in our series of why a Real Estate Transaction fails to close. \n \nToday let's talk about how the Realtor or Property can cause the deal to fall out.\n\nThe Realtor(s):\n\n1. Have no client control over buyers or sellers.\n\n2. Delays access to property for inspection and appraisals.\n\n3. Unfamiliar with their client's financial position -- do they have enough equity to sell, etc.\n\n4. Does not get completed paperwork to the lender in time.\n\n5. Inexperienced in this type of property transaction.\n\n6. Takes unexpected time off during transaction and can't be reached.\n\n7. Jerks around other parties to the transaction -- has huge ego.\n\n8. Does not do sufficient homework on their clients or the property and wastes everyone's time.\n\nThe Property:\n\n9. County will not approve septic system or well.\n\n10. Termite report reveals substantial damage and seller is not willing to fix or repair.\n\n11. Home was misrepresented as to size and condition.\n\n12. Home is destroyed prior to closing.\n\n13. Home not structurally sound.\n\n14. Home is uninsurable for homeowners insurance.\n\n15. Property incorrectly zoned.\n\n16. Portion of home sits on neighbor's property.\n\n17. Unique home and comparable properties for appraisal difficult to find.\n And yet we're still not finished. \n\nIn our fourth and final edition we will talk about the Escrow Company, Appraiser and Inspector.\n\nWhat's my Elk Grove Home Worth?

One of two preserved to this day. \n\nIn this film 6100 is seen climbing up the summit to Crowcombe Heathfield at Norvis Bridge. After a brief stop at Washford 6100 makes its way down the bank en route to Blue Anchor. The final scene concludes with 6100 doubleheading with 45231 'The Sherwood Forester' at Kentsford between Watchet and Washford.\n\n6100 is famously known for her visit to North America in 1933, when built as a parallel boilered loco. She took part in the Century of Progress Exposition held in Chigago, she toured 11,194 miles through Canada and the United States. She wears special commemorative plates on her front driving wheel splashers, in commemoration for her North American tour.", "title": "6100 Royal Scot on the West Somerset Railway, March 2009", "publishedDate": "2009-03-30T13:31:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "B264iVw_3P0", "description": "(\u00b4-`).\uff61oO(\u306a\u3042\u306a\u3042\u677e\u7530\u3055\u3093)\n\uff08\u00b4-`\uff09.\uff61oO(\u306a\u306b\u3088\u6075\u97f3\u3055\u3093)\n(\u00b4-`).\uff61oO(\u30a6\u30c1\u3089\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3044\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u3058\u3083\u306d\uff1f)\n\uff08\u00b4-`\uff09.\uff61oO(\u305b\u3084\u306a...)\u3000\u203b\u97f3\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\n\n\u25a0\u3069\u3046\u3082\u308f\u304a\u3093P\u3053\u3068\u59c9\u97f3\u3067\u3059\uff01\u52d5\u753b\u3082\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u25a0\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u30ab\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9\u306e\u4eba\u3055\u3093\u306e\u300cAPATITE\u300d\u3092\u6075\u97f3\u3055\u3093\u3068\u307d\u3044\u3088\u304f\u3093\u3067\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\n\n\u25a0Vocal\uff1a\u30e6\u30d5\u3055\u3093\u2192\u6075\u97f3\u3055\u3093 \u30b7\u30f3\u304f\u3093\u2192\u307d\u3044\u3088\u304f\u3093(A)\n\u25a0MIX/\u8abf\u58f0/\u52d5\u753b\uff1a\u59c9\u97f3(\u308f\u304a\u3093P)\n\u25a0UST\uff1aUtauReizo\u3055\u3093\n\n\u25a0mp3\u2192http://tmbox.net/pl/300309", "title": "\u3010\u6075\u97f3\u30e1\u30b0\u00d7\u677e\u7530\u3063\u307d\u3044\u3088\u3011APATITE\u3010UTAU\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3011", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T13:34:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "B266Tbg417U", "description": "Reportaje de Telemundo acerca de la iniciativa de Lanugo, \"Soy Americano y Latino de Coraz\u00f3n\".\n\nDebido a los comentarios negativos que han estado rode\u00e1ndonos \u00faltimamente acerca de los Hispanos Americanos cantando el himno \"Star Spangled Banner\" y \"God Bless America\" en importantes eventos deportivos, Lanugo ha iniciado un movimiento, llamado \"Soy Americano y Latino de Coraz\u00f3n\" para alzar nuestras voces y demostrarles a nuestros ni\u00f1os Hispanos Americanos que si pueden y deben de cantar su himno nacional con orgullo. \n\nEl movimiento ha tenido una respuesta tan positiva por parte de la comunidad que Los Marlins de Miami nos han invitado a cantar \"God Bless America\" durante su juego del 8 de Septiembre.", "title": "Reportaje Telemundo: Soy Americano y Latino de Coraz\u00f3n", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T18:01:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B26RedKNhx8", "description": "See the new Boss Girls for the Mob Talker mod!
