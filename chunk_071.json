The system creates an herbicide foam that sticks extremely well to plant surfaces.  As shown in the video, it works great with the cut stump method of treatment commonly used on woody brush and trees.  The system is now available for purchase at http://greenshootsonline.com/GreenShoots/Home.aspx.\n\nWhy is it necessary to use an herbicide after cutting down most invasive shrubs or trees such as the buckthorn shown in this video?  It is essential because otherwise the roots will survive, and sprouts will soon grow out of the stump.  Now you have multiple stems growing out of the stem instead of the single one you started with.  With most herbicide products that homeowners use, it is best to apply the herbicide immediately after cutting the stem of the woody weed.\n\nWhy use the precision foam herbicide system from Green Shoots to control woody invasive weeds like buckthorn?  Use of the Green Shoots foam herbicide system can help do the following: protect non-target, desirable plants from off-target spray and herbicide drift; save you money by cutting back on the amount of herbicide used; and help reduce the amount of herbicide introduced into the environment.\n\nBackground on the Herbicide Glyphosate\nIf you use any herbicide, you must read and follow the label provided with it.  The herbicide used in this video contains the active ingredient glyphosate.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency, which registers herbicide products, has commented on glyphosate's \"low acute toxicity\" and the absence of other toxicological concerns (i.e., carcinogenicity).\"  It also determined in it's last reregistration decision for glyphosate that \"the effects of glyphosate on birds, mammals, fish and invertebrates are minimal.\"  See EPA, Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED): Glyphosate, February 16, 1994.  www.epa.gov/espp/litstatus/effects/glyphosate-red.pdf \n\nBackground on Common Buckthorn\nCommon buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is an invasive shrub/tree in North America and is identified as a noxious weed in many states.  It is an exotic or non-native species brought to the U.S. from Europe in the 1800s primarily for us in hedges ( to mark property lines for example). Since that time, common buckthorn has invaded woodlands all over the United States, especially in the Northeast and Midwest.  It out-competes desirable, native species like native trees, shrubs, grasses, wildflowers, etc.  In this way, buckthorn degrades wildlife habitat and reduces ecological diversity.\n\nBuckthorn out-competes native plants primarily in three ways.  First, it grows well in the shade.  That is why buckthorn has successfully invaded so many forests.  As it grows taller, buckthorn brush forms a dense understory canopy.  This denies sunlight to desirable native seedlings and seedlings cannot thrive.  If you have ever tried to walk or hike through a buckthorn thicket or monoculture, you know what I mean.  Not only is it dense, but the long thorns also scratch you and tear at your clothing.  \n\nEven in urbanized areas you may have common buckthorn growing amongst mature ornamental trees or shrubs.  It often appear in planting beds in yards, gardens, and lawn.  It also grows near foundations of homes, garages, and other buildings.  \n\nGlossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus) is related to common buckthorn.  However, it mostly grows in wetter areas such as near wetlands.  To learn more about common and glossy buckthorn, visit websites such as this one from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/terrestrialplants/woody/buckthorn/index.html", "title": "Invasive Weed Trees - Killing Them with a New Foam Herbicide Dispenser from Green Shoots", "publishedDate": "2011-01-14T15:38:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RAVBoYX5S0", "description": "WVO dual tank system on my other channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZw2VQD4nBs\n\nI ran a jeep on pure hydrogen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6mokIZ8Dr0\n\nMy personal channel http://youtube.com/luker4877\n\nShows how to build a propane injection kit to use on a diesel for less than 150 bucks! I used parts from ebay, a local rv store and Ace Hardware.\n\nThe system has been set up for a power increase, so when you hit the switch, it really sets you back. Some friends of mine have the factory built systems and have them set a little lower. \n\nThey claim the mileage increase is the best single thing they have done for their trucks and that it far outweighs the cost of the propane.\n\nAs I said before, this propane injection system is set up closer to the max you would want to add, and it increases the horsepower by probably about 100 I'm guessing. \n\nThe Superchips Max Microtuner that is installed in the truck is supposed to add about 50-70 horses depending on which setting you use. Flipping the propane switch adds a lot more than that by feel. I rarely ever use the thing, but almost every year, I go down to Bandimere Speedway for truck fest and have some fun. \n\nThe best times I've got with this old truck, fuel tank, tool box and all was in the high 15's.

The Heating is about as warm as a hot tub. Research has shown that heat can damage or kill cancer cells in some tumors while also making radiation and chemotherapy more effective.\n\nWhile it has been known for hundreds of years that fevers can kill cancer, only recently has technology been developed that can control and focus heat specifically on tumors.\n\nLocal hyperthermia treatment (heat applied to a very small area, such as a tumor) is a well-established cancer treatment. Primary malignant tumors have a bad blood circulation, which make them more sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\n\n\"Our own clinical experience and the results of numerous published studies are highly encouraging in that increased use of hyperthermia will improve the quality of life for cancer patients and improve control of cancer recurrences.\"\n\nDr. Gerald Sokol, New Hope Cancer Center, Hudson, FL.\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia is offering our patients new hope. We are often seeing faster responses, better cancer control, and fewer side effects.\"\n\nDr. Leland Rogers, GammaWest, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia gives us a method to treat people when there are few other alternatives. It's an additional form of treatment that can be done in difficult cases, usually without serious side effects or complications.\"\n\nDr. Steven Stroup, Centennial Hospital, Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n\"When the tumor is of larger size, it is unresectable surgically. Also, radiation has less effect on the center part of the tumor, which is deprived of the oxygen blood supply and the nutrients. By increasing the temperature of the tissues from 42-44 degrees centigrade, (hyperthermia) increases the circulation, increases the oxygenation, so that the radiation is more effective.\"\n\nNasir Syed, Long Beach Memorial Center, Long Beach, CA", "title": "News Feature: Hyperthermia Treatment Recurrent Breast Cancer", "publishedDate": "2008-06-25T04:01:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RBgqSXdJ-I", "description": "Join Me: On Thursday at 2pm, I will be announcing my candidacy for New York City Comptroller on the steps of  City Hall. \n\nDate: June 27th \nTime: 2pm\nWhere: Steps of New York City Hall\n\n\"My parents relied heavily on their pensions, especially later in their lives when they were challenged with heart disease and cancer.

Since about Sept 2009, they have progressed rapidly. She is now having clusters of episodes several times a day. They can last anywhere between 5 sec to 5 min.\n\nShe usually does not do this when she is standing/walking, only when sitting/lying down/at rest. Only twice have I noticed her doing this while standing, and that was only just recently. She also usually doesn't talk through her episodes, but again, she just recently did this as well. As far as walking is concerned I do not see any funny gaits. She is pigeon-toed, and flat-footed and will more often than not, walk on her tiptoes. \n\nShe doesn't have these episodes when hyper, excited or stressed. Though I do wonder if the episodes arent triggered by her hyperactivity. She doesn't do it if \"startled\". Lately she has also been crying a lot in her sleep and talking too. I do not sleep in the same room with her, so it is hard to say if she is doing this in her sleep. When she falls asleep she does twitch a lot, but I just dont know to what extent she is doing this during the night, and if that is contributing to her waking up and crying.\n\nShe isn't overly sociable with strangers; she usually just clams up and doesn't say a single word or makes a single sound (selective muteness). She rarely speaks when around her therapists as well, and she has been seeing most of them for over 2 years now. \n\nSpeech, even though slightly delayed at first, is pretty good; says many words, uses 2-3 word sentences. \n\nShe has had a 4 hr and a 48 hr EEG, which show no seizure disorder. All blood tests and urine tests appear normal. She has had 2 clean MRI's. Yet, she continues to have these episodes and they are progressing. She has also had an abdominal ultrasound to rule out neuroblastoma. And a strep antibodies test to rule out PANDAS. Everything is negative thus far. She is scheduled for a genetic test on 3/29/10.\n\nShe is being followed by:\n\nShriner's Hospital for Cerebral Palsy, Tibial torsion, Pigeon-toe, Clonus, etc. \nEndocrinologist for Premature Thelarche / Precocious Puberty. \nGastroenterologist for GI / constipation issues; they say she has a slow digestive system, and they have had her on Miralax for about a year. I took her off of it in Feb 2010, just in case the Miralax could be contributing to her episodes. She is now on Ranitidine for Reflux.\nENT - Her first year, she used to get frequent ear infections and was on antibiotics a LOT. During this time, I rarely saw her disorder. But then she had tubes put in her ears 7/22/09. She stopped being on so many antibiotics then about Sept 2009 these episodes started progressing. I dont know if that has ANYTHING to do with it or not. \nAllergist for her eczema/rashes.\nPediatric Neurologist for this movement disorder.\nNutritionist for Failure to Thrive.\nPhysical Therapy, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy for all delays.  (Her speech therapist is currently working on her oral aversion / texture feeding issues, as well as her immature suck and getting her to talk more.)\n\nShe was a 28 week old / 2.8 oz preemie and had pretty much all the delays that come from being premature. She did need to be resuscitated at birth (10/07). She did not get a blood transfusion while in the NICU.  She was on a ventilator when she was first born. And she also had an IVH1 bleed on the right side of her brain. She did not leave the NICU until 12/07. She was on breast milk fortified by Neosure, then just on Neosure, and is currently on Pediasure.\n\nI have uploaded several videos on youtube because it is so hard to get all her movements in just one of her episodes. \n\nShe does have staring spells while doing this. I used to be able to talk her out of it, but sometimes that does not work. She will look right through me and won't answer when I speak to her. Sometimes touching her helps, but again, other times she doesnt respond to that either.\n\nI can see her episodes coming on because she will have this wide-eyed look in her eyes. I don't know if she is in pain or not; or if she is getting a warning or premonitory sensation, as she is too young to describe what she is experiencing. If she is sitting on me, I can feel them coming on because sometimes it starts with her back slowly arching and twisting. Sometimes I can tell by her eye blinking or her tongue movements.\n\nSpeaking of which, she is doing a lot more weird things with her mouth. She does this tongue-in-cheek thing. It's almost like her mouth is always full of something and she is chewing away at it. Her tongue is usually hanging out of her mouth a little. She has been drooling an awful lot lately. I haven't caught that on video very well yet, but I'm working on it.\n\nAs I mentioned before, she has started doing a lot of blinking just before her episodes. FINALLY got it on video!

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors.

Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots. It has also been established that low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue. Aspirin may be effective at preventing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\n150px-Aspirin-skeletal.svg.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin", "title": "All About - Aspirin", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T13:54:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RhiUGfTy3A", "description": "Showing vanadium, a transition element at the middle of periodic table with multiple oxydation states.", "title": "Vanadium", "publishedDate": "2008-01-10T12:53:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rhn6xJTfS8", "description": "\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 (Pac-World) OP\nPAC THIS WORLD!!! by \u30d2\u30e3\u30c0\u30a4\u30f3 (Hyadain)\n\nPac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Japanese Opening", "title": "\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 OP - PAC THIS WORLD!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05T10:48:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Ri6IVywUnU", "description": "From the album, \"She Got Game (Deluxe Edition)\".

Der Hamburger Oberrealsch\u00fcler brachte es beim Jungvolk der Hitler-Jugend bis zum Bannf\u00fchrer. Von 1937 bis 1939 ging er wieder nach S\u00e3o Paulo, wo er eine Lehre im Hotelfach absolvierte und in den v\u00e4terlichen Gastronomiebetrieben arbeitete. Hier bet\u00e4tigte er sich in seiner Freizeit erstmals als Laiendarsteller .\nAb 1939 nahm er am Zweiten Weltkrieg teil und wurde mehrmals schwer verwundet. 1946 gab er sein Deb\u00fct als Schauspieler an der Niedersachsenb\u00fchne in Goslar. Von 1947 bis 1949 nahm er Schauspielunterricht bei Walter Falk und Helmuth Gmelin in Hamburg. 1947 trat er in Hamburg an der B\u00fchne \u201eDie Rampe\" auf, dann am Theater im Zimmer, und geh\u00f6rte ab 1949 zum Ensemble des Deutschen Schauspielhaus.\n1951 gr\u00fcndete Sch\u00fctter zusammen mit dem Schauspieler Wolfgang Borchert (nicht identisch mit dem 1947 verstorbenen Schriftsteller) das Junge Theater in Hamburg. Ziel der beiden Gr\u00fcnder war es vor allem, ein Forum f\u00fcr zeitgen\u00f6ssische Dramatik wie auch eine B\u00fchne f\u00fcr die Nachwuchsf\u00f6rderung zu schaffen. Erste Spielst\u00e4tte war die historische Br\u00fccke in den Gro\u00dfen Bleichen. Von dort ging es 1952 in die Neue Rabenstra\u00dfe, 1956 in die Marschnerstra\u00dfe (heute: Theater an der Marschnerstra\u00dfe) und schlie\u00dflich 1964 an die Mundsburg.\nAm 22. M\u00e4rz 1973, dem vierten Todestag von Ernst Deutsch, wurde das Junge Theater als Reminiszenz an dessen vorangegangene, herausragende Darstellung von Lessings Nathan der Weise in Ernst-Deutsch-Theater umbenannt. Bis zu seinem Tod 1995 war Friedrich Sch\u00fctter Direktor dieses Theaters.\nSeit den sp\u00e4ten 1950er Jahren machte sich Sch\u00fctter einen Namen als Schauspieler. Er trat in vielen Kinofilmen und unz\u00e4hligen Fernsehserien auf, so in Stahlnetz, Cliff Dexter, Percy Stuart, Hafenpolizei, Tatort, Schwarz Rot Gold oder Der Landarzt. 1967 sah man ihn als Grigori Jewsejewitsch Sinowjew als einer der Hauptdarsteller in dem f\u00fcnfteiligen dokumentarischen Fernsehfilm B\u00fcrgerkrieg in Ru\u00dfland, mit Nikolaj Rytkov, Friedrich G. Beckhaus, Hubert Suschka und Albert Venohr in weiteren Hauptrollen. Wolfgang Schleif f\u00fchrte Regie in dieser ZDF-Produktion. 1986 stand er unter der Regie von Edwin Marian in dem Politthriller \"Cortuga\" gemeinsam mit Ang\u00e9lique Duvier, Heiner Lauterbach und Sissi H\u00f6fferer vor der Kamera\nEine seiner bekanntesten Rollen war die des Chauffeurs Kr\u00f6ger in Das Erbe der Guldenburgs. Kurz vor seinem Tod spielte er die Titelrolle in dem Fernsehfilm Molls Reisen, eine seiner wenigen Hauptrollen. Von 1979 bis 1987 war Sch\u00fctter mit der Schauspielerin Ang\u00e9lique Duvier verheiratet, mit der er auf der B\u00fchne in vielen gro\u00dfen Rollen zu sehen war, so in Antigone, Der Kaukasische Kreidekreis, Eurydike oder Mutter Courage. 1987 trennte sich das Paar nach elf gemeinsamen Jahren.\nAls Synchronsprecher war Sch\u00fctter untrennbar mit dem kanadischen Schauspieler Lorne Greene verbunden, den er als Ben Cartwright in Bonanza und auch in Kampfstern Galactica sprach. Unvergesslich ist seine sonore Stimme auch durch die Sprechgesangfassung der Desiderata (Segensw\u00fcnsche) auf seiner Langspielplatte Ein Mensch (1971).\n1995 erlag Friedrich Sch\u00fctter einem Krebsleiden. Er wurde auf dem Friedhof Bergedorf im Hamburger Stadtteil Bergedorf beigesetzt.\nDas Ernst-Deutsch-Theater, das mit zeitweiliger Unterbrechung von seiner letzten und auch kulturpolitisch engagierten Ehefrau Isabella V\u00e9rtes-Sch\u00fctter (* 1962) als Intendantin weitergef\u00fchrt wird, ist weit \u00fcber Hamburg hinaus f\u00fcr seine lebendige Auseinandersetzung mit Geschichte und Gegenwart bekannt.\n\nEhrungen:\n\n1971 erhielt Friedrich Sch\u00fctter den Ehrenpreis Silberne Maske der Hamburger Volksb\u00fchne. 1984 bekam er die die Auszeichnung als Ehren-Schleusenw\u00e4rter, der Platz vor dem Ernst-Deutsch-Theater wurde 2002 nach dem Mitbegr\u00fcnder in Friedrich-Sch\u00fctter-Platz benannt.", "title": "Friedrich Sch\u00fctter - Diese Eine Strasse  (1973)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-20T16:07:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rl0CaFDhN8", "description": "Enderby Youth Band playing an extract from Peter Meechans test piece Sentinel in Part 4 of their program from the 2012 Action Medical Research Youth Entertainment Championships of Great Britain held in the Winter Gardens in Blackpool.", "title": "Sentinel.

Even with my right foot buried, I see nothing but taillights until they disappear into the desert.\n\nIn these few brief seconds, the 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 is clearly defined by its soft edges and quiet exhaust. Manufacturers don't let us feel cars raw and unfiltered anymore. Hammering down a desert road with a thin-rimmed steering wheel and pistol-grip shifter \u2014 that's raw. Four hundred and forty cubic inches and a four-speed \u2014 that's raw. Powerslides unhampered by electronic intervention \u2014 that's raw.\n\nIn 1970, when Kowalski drove this very road \u2014 U.S. Highway 50 through Nevada \u2014 he felt it. And it was raw.", "title": "Challenger New vs. Old:  Vanishing Point Revisited", "publishedDate": "2008-05-13T00:59:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rq6iUHdeUo", "description": "Practice the mouth positions of [\u025b] vs. [\u00e6], so that you can distinguish numerous pairs of words (in American English). \n\nORIGINAL LESSON TEXT: \nhttp://www.elementalenglish.com/e-vs-ae-english-vowel-pronunciation/\n\nJoin us on Facebook!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/elementalenglish\n\nGet the free iTunes podcast:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/english-pronunciation-language/id465174263\n\nTwitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/elementlenglish", "title": "[\u025b] vs. [\u00e6] | English Vowel Pronunciation", "publishedDate": "2014-10-15T16:56:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rq7UjYCoTI", "description": "", "title": "Gera MXM / tic tac toc (PREVIO 2014) ,Soul mind produce.", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T20:09:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rq8s9s0AL4", "description": "Four men cut a hole in a roof to get their friend to Jesus to be healed.", "title": "Jesus Heals the Paralytic", "publishedDate": "2008-04-17T02:40:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RqJFza3sbE", "description": "A Grizzly Bear takes on an American Badger and gets more than he ever bargained for.

La protecci\u00f3n contra el sol es fundamental y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la piel tambi\u00e9n debe afectar a los ojos. En este sentido los ni\u00f1os son los m\u00e1s vulnerables, en pocas ocasiones utilizan gafas de sol, solo el 2% lo hace.\n\nEspa\u00f1a es un pa\u00eds con una alta incidencia de radici\u00f3n ultravioleta y en esta \u00e9poca de verano se triplica. Por ello es fundamental utilizar protecci\u00f3n para los ojos, en especial en los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os. Aunque son ni\u00f1os, su pupila es m\u00e1s grande que la de los adultos y permite que entre una mayor cantidad de luz.\n\nEl cristalino hasta los 12 a\u00f1os es casi trasparente, son ojos m\u00e1s indefensos, por eso, el empleo de gafas de sol deber\u00eda ser habitual, hasta el punto de que pueden aparecer quemaduras a nivel de la c\u00f3rnea.\n\nLa radiaci\u00f3n solar es acumulativa. Los ojos, como la piel, tienen memoria y los ni\u00f1os son 20 veces m\u00e1s sensibles a los efectos nocivos del sol.\n\nNos damos una vuelta por la playa y comprobamos que los que llevan gafas de sol no son espa\u00f1oles y no solo porque les queden bien como nos aseguran. Aqu\u00ed lo de las gafas y los ni\u00f1os sigue siendo asignatura pendiente.\n\nLa poblaci\u00f3n mundial est\u00e1 dejando de dar importancia a la salud ocular, a pesar de que un 80% de los casos de deterioro visual se podr\u00edan prevenir con un diagn\u00f3stico precoz. As\u00ed lo asegura una encuestra realizada por Bausch+Lomb\n\nEl n\u00famero de personas que se somete a revisiones regulares de la vista es a\u00fan insuficiente y los motivos para hacerlo var\u00edan dr\u00e1sticamente. \"Para muchas personas, los ojos son el espejo del alma. Sin embargo, para los profesionales sanitarios, los ojos son el reflejo del estado de salud general\", asegura el jefe m\u00e9dico de Bausch+Lomb, Cal Roberts. \n\nUno de los principales motivos por los que no se realizan suficientes revisiones tiene que ver con el desconocimiento de la relaci\u00f3n existente entre la salud ocular y el estado general de salud. Este hecho se debe a que los ojos son \u00f3rganos en los que se puede observar el estado de las venas y arterias de cada persona, lo que permite a los profesionales de la oftalmolog\u00eda detectar m\u00e1s de 150 signos de enfermedades tales como la diabetes, el colesterol alto o la hipertensi\u00f3n incluso a\u00f1os antes de que el paciente manifieste otros s\u00edntomas.", "title": "Solo el 2% de los ni\u00f1os utiliza gafas de sol", "publishedDate": "2012-07-28T19:12:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rqsv9vkfes", "description": "Maybe its you is reality of life God says hush little children don't you cry no more", "title": "fosterchild  maybe its you", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T20:05:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Rr1ezJrRAw", "description": "Like a pig in shit.", "title": "Highbrow Drug Abuse", "publishedDate": "2006-08-27T16:15:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RrDR8xbWnM", "description": "DAPHNIAS o Pulgas de Agua, son unos peque\u00f1os crust\u00e1ceos de agua dulce.\nEn el presente video est\u00e1n capturadas las im\u00e1genes con un peque\u00f1o microscopio digital en el agua de una charca.\n\nDominio: Eukaryota\nReino:            Animalia\nFilo:            Arthropoda\nSubfilo: Crustacea\nClase:            Branchiopoda\nOrden: Cladocera\nFamilia: Daphniidae\nG\u00e9nero: Daphnia M\u00fcller, 1785", "title": "DAPHNIAS, CRUST\u00c1CEOS PLANCT\u00d3NICOS", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T14:52:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RrOjw1m7Iw", "description": "Representantes de Afutu a nivel nacional estuvieron en Cerro Largo tratando una serie de irregularidades ocurridas en utu Acegu\u00e1.\nLa desaparici\u00f3n de un torno perteneciente a utu Melo y un caso de Acoso Laboral fueron tratados.\nConsultamos a R\u00faben Figueroa y Juan P\u00e9rez.", "title": "Representantes de afutu denuncian irregularidades en utu Acegu\u00e1.", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T15:04:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RraWcdAInQ", "description": "Soul Calibur 3\n\nCPU vs CPU (extremely hard difficulty)", "title": "SoulCalibur III [PS2] | Sophitia Vs Abelia", "publishedDate": "2010-08-08T18:01:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3RrlTAD5PQY", "description": "------------------------------------\u2665 Open Me For More Info! \u2665--------------------------------------\n\nMusic by Landon Austin\nhttp://www.youtube.com/LandonAustin\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/landon-austin/id272739505?uo=4\n\n-----------------------------------------------\u2665MY LINKS\u2665----------------------------------------------\n\nFollow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/makeupdiva17\n\n\"Like\" me on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/makeupdiva17\n\nInstagram: http://followgram.me/makeupdiva17\n\nSnapchat me! @makeupdiva17\n\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/makeupdiva17\n\nTumblr: http://makeupdiva17.tumblr.com\n\nFashion/Inspiration Tumblr: http://wakemewhenitscouture.tumblr.com\n\n-----------------------------------------------Disclaimer--------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always, all opinions are my own!!

"According to chronicles from the Byzantine Empire, the Ak Koyunlu were present in eastern Anatolia from at least 1340, and most of their leaders, including the dynasty's founder, Uzun Hassan,[3] married Byzantine princesses.[4]\n\nThe Ak Koyunlu Turkomans first acquired land in 1402, when Timur granted them all of Diyar Bakr in present-day Turkey. For a long time, the Ak Koyunlu were unable to expand their territory, as the rival Kara Koyunlu or \"Black Sheep Turkomans\" kept them at bay. However, this changed with the rule of Uzun Hassan, who defeated the Black Sheep Turkoman leader Jah\u0101n Sh\u0101h in 1467.\n\nAfter the defeat of an Timurid leader, Abu Sa'id, Uzun Hassan was able to take Baghdad along with territories around the Persian Gulf. He expanded into Iran as far east as Khorasan. However, around this time, the Ottoman Empire sought to expand eastwards, a serious threat that forced the Ak Koyunlu into an alliance with the Karamanids of central Anatolia.\n\nAs early as 1464, Uzun Hassan had requested military aid from one of the Ottoman Empire's strongest enemies, Venice, however, despite Venetian promises, this aid never arrived, and as a result, Uzun Hassan was defeated by the Ottomans at the Battle of Otlukbeli in 1473, though this did not destroy the Ak Koyunlu.\n\nWhen Uzun Hassan died early in 1478, he was succeeded by his son Khalil Mirza (Sultan Khalil), but the latter was defeated by a confederation under his younger brother Ya'qub at the Battle of Khoy in July\nThe Kara Koyunlu Turkomans at one point established their capital in Herat in eastern Persia,[6] and were vassals of the Jalayirid dynasty in Baghdad and Tabriz from about 1375, when the leader of their leading tribe, ruled over Mosul. However, they rebelled against the Jalayirids, and secured their independence from the dynasty with the conquest of Tabriz by Qara Yusuf. In 1400, the armies of Tamerlane defeated the Kara Koyunlu, and Qara Yusuf fled to Egypt seeking refuge with the Mamluks. He gathered an army and by 1406 had taken back Tabriz. In 1410, the Kara Koyunlu captured Baghdad. The installation of a subsidiary Black Sheep Turkomans line there hastened the downfall of the Jalayirids whom they had once served. Despite internal fighting amongst Kara Yusuf's descendants after his death in 1420, and the increasing threat of the Timurids, the Black Sheep Turkomans maintained a strong grip over the areas they controlled.", "title": "White Sheep Aq Koyunlu Turcoman vs Black Sheep Turcoman karakoyunluafter the demise of Timurids", "publishedDate": "2014-05-04T22:22:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SCGLsbogeA", "description": "This video shows you how to say or pronounce Refulgence.\n\nHow would you say Refulgence?", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Refulgence", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T16:29:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SCMlP-iDbA", "description": "camera surveillance\nVol PC Acer Mini", "title": "camera surveillance : vol fes hay tarik", "publishedDate": "2013-03-20T00:58:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SCPGkQBVNQ", "description": "", "title": "PAMIR TV - 24 \u041b\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0430  \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043a\u0430 !!", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T17:40:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SCQtuLVCGE", "description": "Extended video of the NCS Div III game vs Terra Linda, May 31.\nFirst ever Sectional title for the Red Tailed Hawks, Final, 3-2.

Tyler Carter - Official Lyric Video\n \nArtist city, country: Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.\n \nArtist Biography: Accompanied by an array of strobe lights and synth, I Capture Castle is much more than an addiction of bone-shivering breakdowns, electrifying keys, and mesmerizing melodies. They have truly developed a reputation of being one of the most divergent and explosive electronic hardcore bands to take the stage. Ever since their debut appearance as an opener for The Artery Foundation Across The Nation Tour in 2009, I Capture Castle has taken the West Coast by storm, featuring on many nationally recognized tours including Scream The Prayer, Rock Yourself To Sleep, Warped Tour, and Uproar Festival.\n\nIn 2010, I Capture Castle released their debut EP entitled 'Throw Me The Rope', recorded by highly acclaimed engineer Matt Winegar (Coheed and Cambria, Primus, Royal Bliss). The album's combining elements strayed from the anticipated cliches, simply redefining the standard, and averting any limitation to their already diverse sound. An artistic blend of shreadified metal and contemporary dance-driven pop, accented by a layer of laser-ready electronica and chug-induced hardcore. Two acoustic tracks were included in the release, giving the album an even greater dramatic contrast.\n\nIn 2011, I Capture Castle returned from the studio with their latest EP 'Overture'. The album surpassed expectation, reaching such great heights as guest vocalist Joel Piper (of Confide and Avery Pkwy) was featured on its opening track 'Namaste'. The record also included their hardcore rendition of Kesha's hit single 'Take It Off', demonstrating the band's innovation and ability to expand into various genres. Overflowing with immaculate highs and death defying lows, this 3-song EP is an unexpected roller coaster of emotion, filled with translucent yet profound lyrics. Soon after the release of 'Overture', I Capture Castle became product of hype, launching their debut music video 'Dude Man I Dunno Bro', and listeners worldwide became familiar with their newly-cemented brand of electronic hardcore. The video soon captured the attention of music journalist Bryan Stars, as he deemed I Capture Castle one of the 'hottest upcoming bands'. Following the release of their video, the band left on their first headlining tour 'The Epilepsy On The Dance Floor Tour', receiving recognition from mainstream media including SmartPunk, BlankTV, Sugar Entertainment, and radio play throughout the West Coast. The band then closed out the year with the release of their second music video 'Take It Off'.\n\nSurrounded by an impending trend of followers, and lead by a determination and drive that can't be touched, it is safe to say that we haven't heard the last from I Capture Castle. As they continue to progress and transcend expectation, the culmination of this group is still to come. With plans of an upcoming mid-west tour, a highly anticipated album, and much more, I Capture Castle is aggressively setting the pace for 2014, their biggest year yet.\n \nDirector Name: Ty Jensen\nDirector Link: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tyjens-Media-LLC/102474039853674\nProducer Name: Ty Jensen\nProducer Link: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tyjens-Media-LLC/102474039853674\n \nAbout The Video: This song was written about the award winning t.v. series Dexter.\n \nArtist Website: http://icapturecastle.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ICaptureCastleSLC\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/icapturecastleslc/music/songs\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ICaptureCastle\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ICaptureCastle\nReverbNation: https://www.facebook.com/ICaptureCastleSLC/app_2405167945\n \n \n \n***\n \nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/BlankTV", "title": "I Capture Castle - \"Slice of Life\" feat.

Or videos here http://www.youtube.com/user/headgardener2u/ \n\n  The major problem gardeners have with shade - besides the lack of sunlight - is a lack of water.  When trees are providing the garden shade, they are very greedy with water and will starve and out-compete most plants.  Tree roots are very efficient so it is necessary to give the trees their 1.5 inches of water and the perennials their 1.5 inches.  Instead of watering then to 1-2 inches of water, you're going to have to provide 2-3 inches of water to keep both plants happy.\n\nThe other thing that shade gardeners sometimes moan about is the lack of flowers on many shade plants.  Let me simply say that perennial flowers for the shade make up with smaller flowers by having much more colorful leaves.  These leaves provide a season-long show in our gardens rather than a burst-and-gone display.   Another issue that's sometimes brought up is the lack of perennials for the shade.  This isn't true although many garden centers pretend it is by not stocking great shade plants.  I've written about a few of them on my  perennial website above and review new perennial flowers at http://www.douggreensgarden.com\n\nYou can find me at G+ here  https://plus.google.com/u/0/107836847806083557330/posts \nFacebook is here  https://www.facebook.com/DougGreensGardening\nTwitter is here https://twitter.com/douggreen", "title": "Perennial Garden: Shade perennials", "publishedDate": "2007-12-18T22:48:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SL7XlEaD6Q", "description": "http://www.lisakwinkler.com/ A fascinating Black History memoir tells the little-known six-month adventure of an African-American cowboy who rode horseback from Manhattan to California.\n\nThat gripping journey by Miles Dean, filled with stops to recognize sites that were milestones in African-American culture, is shared in detail by author Lisa K.

The coffee industry has overworked, underpaid, and taken advantage of these farmers for decades. While coffee represents billions of dollars of world commerce, only a fraction of that money makes it back to the farmers, many of whom lack access to clean water, health-care, education, and a secure home.\n\nBorn out of a struggle for basic human rights in impoverished farming communities around the world, the fair trade movement was launched for the sake of social and economic justice. It empowers small family farmers and their communities through long-term trading relationships, fair prices, and safe and sustainable working conditions. Farmers, activists, and dedicated companies have built true fair trade painstakingly, from the ground up. \n\nToday, bigger corporations are co-opting fair trade as a marketing concept instead of a social movement.  This threatens to dilute fair trade standards and the growing array of certifications and labels have become confusing to the average coffee drinker.\n\nThis January, Join the founders of two socially conscious US coffee roasteries as they travel deep into Central America, examining fair trade's impact on farmers they've worked with over the past decade. The relationships between these buyers and producers will be a springboard for an examination of the basic principles, history, and current controversies surrounding fair trade. This exclusive web series will share the dramatic stories of co-ops and farmers along their route through Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. \n\nHow fair is fair trade? Come along and see how small-scale producers and roasters are working together to reclaim the movement.\n\nPART 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbjOdCQ_-Y\nPART 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MF10N4z8J4&feature=youtu.be", "title": "Fair Trade Chronicles: Intro", "publishedDate": "2012-12-31T02:57:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3SQhEjWL0Zk", "description": "Larva Season 1 Episode (85-86-87-88) 4 in 1\nLarva Season 1 Episode (85-86-87-88) 4 in 1\n\n[Season 2] Larva 2013 || Ep 21 (Ephemera 1 & 2) [Full HD] - YouTube SEASION 2] Larva 2013 [Full HD] || Part 2 (Ep 20 - 34) END - YouTube [Season 2] Larva 2013 || Ep 28 (Larvacar & Yellow Diet) [Full HD ...

This is Olso's Second oldest Church dating from 1697 and contains elaborate stained glass from Emanual Vigeland ( the famous Gustav's brother). The cathedral has been consecrated in 1697. You can see there the Emanuel Vigeland's stained glass window and the nice altar showing The Last Supper. The altar shovel of the Domkirke was made by Michael Rasch in the 1748. It rappresents the Last Dinner and the Crucifixion. In the years ago it was moved into different Norwegian's churches but in 1950 it comes back to Oslo. The nice organ was made in the 17th century.\n\nAugustine was born in 354 to a pagan father named Patricius and a Christian mother named Monica in the municipium of Thagaste (now Souk Ahras, Algeria) in Roman Africa. It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of Berber origin, on the basis of her name, but as his family were honestiores, Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin. At age 17, through the generosity of fellow citizen Romanianus,[20] Augustine went to Carthage to continue his education in rhetoric. Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the Manichaean religion, much to the despair of his mother, Monica.\n\nAt a young age, he began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. She was his lover for over thirteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, Symmachus, who had been asked to provide a professor of rhetoric for the imperial court at Milan. The bishop of Milan, Ambrose baptized Augustine, along with his son, Adeodatus, on Easter Vigil in 387 in Milan, and a year later they returned to Africa. In 391 he was ordained a priest in Hippo Regius (now Annaba, in Algeria). In 395 he was made coadjutor Bishop of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter.\n\nShortly before Augustine's death, Roman Africa was invaded by the Vandals, a Germanic tribe that had converted to Arianism. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential Psalms of David be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. Shortly after his death the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.\n\n1327 Pope John XXII issued the papal bull Veneranda Santorum Patrum, in which he appointed the Augustinians guardians of the tomb of Augustine, which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-treliefs of scenes from Augustine's life. The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in Milan with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled Arca, which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair and was a military magazine during the Napoleonic occupation of the city. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo\n\nPsalm 19 is the 19th psalm in the Book of Psalms (the 18th in the Septuagint numbering). It is ascribed to David. The psalm consider the glory of God in Creation\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_19\n\nThe Holy Lance (also known as the Spear of Destiny, Holy Spear, Lance of Longinus, Spear of Longinus or Spear of Christ) is the name given to the lance that pierced Jesus' side as he hung on the cross in John's account of the Crucifixion.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance\n\nSt. Maurice's Abbey (French: Abbaye de Saint-Maurice d'Agaune or Saint-Maurice-en-Valais) is a historical building in Saint-Maurice, Canton of Valais, Switzerland.

Typically this involves unlock codes which are a series of numbers which can be entered into your mobile phone via the phones key pad to remove the network restriction and allow the use of other SIM cards.\n\u2022\nWhat are the advantages of unlocking my phone?\nThe biggest advantage of getting your phone unlocked is choice. With your phone unlocked you can swap SIM cards at different times to get the best value of the different tariffs from the providers, you can choose which network and which tariff you want at various times.\n\nMobile phones which are unlocked tend to have a greater second hand value, the value of your handset could be increased. Many people will unlock their mobiles so they can use a local prepaid SIM card when in a different country instead of using the costly 'roaming' feature provided by their current network provider.\n\u2022\nWhy would I want to unlock my phone?\nThere are hundreds of network operators around the globe that lock their phones onto their networks. So we un-lock the SIM locks from the phone so that you can use any network you please.\n\nUnlocking your phone will give you freedom to purchase or use a SIM card from another network in your own country or even worldwide. Unlocking your phone will give you the opportunity to change the SIM card to a local provider when abroad, allowing much cheaper calls. It will also increase the value of your phone if you sell it.\n\u2022\nHow will I know if my phone is locked?\nTo find out if your phone is locked, simply place a different SIM card in the phone and turn the phone on. Ensure you use a different SIM and not the SIM that the phone was supplied with. If the phone does not allow you to make calls and displays an error message such as 'SIM not valid', 'Phone Restricted', 'SIM not accepted' or it's asking you to enter an unlock code then your phone is most likely to be locked.\n\u2022\nHow do you unlock my phone?\nYou provide us with easy to find details of your phone e.g. the type, the IMEI number, country and the network that supplied the phone. This information is then used to provide an unlock code to unlock your phone. You simply follow the instructions we provide, and the phone will be unlocked - easy!\n\u2022\nDo I need the original SIM card to unlock my phone?\nThe unlock codes we supply for most handsets will be entered without any SIM card inserted. However, certain handsets do require either an alternative SIM card, or the original SIM card to be inserted in order for the unlock codes to work.\n\u2022\nDo I require technical knowledge?\nNone at all, we provide complete and easy instructions for unlocking your phone. Often it can be as simple as entering an unlock code using the phone's keypad. If there is a problem unlocking your phone using the codes we provide then we will endeavor to solve the problem to the best of our ability.\n\u2022\nWhat do I do with the unlock codes?\nOnce you receive the codes, follow our detailed instructions and enter the codes into your phone by using the phone keypad. It is simple and straight forward and will immediately unlock your phone.\n\u2022\nWill my phone still work?\nYes, unlocking simply removes the network lock and SIM lock that are entered into the phones software when sold to you by the network.\n\u2022\nWill the unlock codes damage my phone?\nRemoving the network restriction on your mobile phone with unlock codes is the safest form of unlocking available. You simply enter the necessary codes directly into your phone via the keypad to remove the network restriction.", "title": "How To Unlock Alcatel One Touch Scribe Easy 8000 (OT-8000, OT-8000X, OT-8000D and OT-8000A)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-13T12:05:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Sgr-Ys35WE", "description": "\u0398\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf positive \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf; \u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5 Like!

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) primarily are a result of atherosclerosis and are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence over the past decade suggests that severe periodontal disease is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Several possible mechanisms may operate independently or in concert to explain this association. The mechanisms resulting in pathology from both periodontitis and CVD are similar i.e., both diseases have complex causation that includes genetic and gender predispositions, age, diabetes, smoking, social status, and stress. Periodontal infections may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thromboembolicevents by providing repeated systemic challenges with LPS and inflammatory cytokines. The oral cavity of individuals with periodontitis represents a potentially large reservoir of Gram-negative pathogenic organisms that can penetrate gingival tissues, enter the circulation and contribute to atherosclerosis progression.\n The possible relationship between infectious diseases and the genesis of atherosclerosis remains hypothetical. It is important todistinguish between the potential role of infectious diseases in atherogenesis and the possibility that infection may enhance a smoldering inflammatory process that is already present in atheromatous plaques.", "title": "Periodontal disease and Systemic Health Issues.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-02-16T13:15:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Sx6kcJC5gA", "description": "GranMusik - \u6182\u9b31\u306a\u5348\u5f8c", "title": "GranMusik - \u6182\u9b31\u306a\u5348\u5f8c", "publishedDate": "2010-03-13T14:52:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Sx85Q2i93g", "description": "Kachari is a generic term applied to a number of ethnic groups predominantly in Assam speaking Tibeto-Burman languages or claiming a common ancestry. The Dimasa people (or Dima-basa, and also called Dimasa-Kachari) are a group of people in Assam, in northeastern India. Dimasa mythology says they are the children of Bangla Raja and the great divine bird Arikhidima. Bangla Raja's six sons\u2014Sibrai, Doo Raja, Naikhu Raja, Waa Raja, Gunyung Brai Yung, and Hamyadao\u2014and Arikhidima are their ancestors, and in Dimasa belief, are ancestral Gods. They are called Madai in Dimasa. Evil spirits born of the seven eggs of Arikhidima are responsible for disease, suffering and natural calamities.\n\nAncient Dimasa tradition maintains that sixty thousand moons (Lunar months) ago, they left their ancestral land when it suffered a severe drought. After a long wandering, they settled at Di-laobra Sangibra, the confluence of the Brahmaputra and Sangi or Di-tsang. There they held a great assembly. The place is the present West Bengal area where the River Ganges and the Brahmaputra join, and where the Kacharis established their first Seat. Over time, their kingdom over large territories.\n\nThe Dimasa are part of the greater Kachari group\u2014one of the ancient Kachari tribes. They live mostly in the northern half of the Dima Hasao District, an administrative district of the Indian state of Assam that includes the ravines of the Jatinga valley and adjoining land. The name 'Dimasa' most probably stands for \"children of the big river,\" referring to earstwhile on the seashore or on the bank of big river. Kacharis appear to be one of the earliest indigenous ethnic groups of north eastern India. Most independent tribal communities in this region are of Kachari origin. The Boro, Rabha, Sonowal, Thengal, Dimasa, Garo, Hajong, Deori, Sutiya, Tiwa or Lalung, Hojai, Barman of Kachar, Trippra, Mech, Rukkini Barman of Hailakandi and Karimganj etc. are all of Kachari origin.\n\nDimasa Kachari are mainly found in the present-day Dima Hasao District (Old name \"North Cachar Hills\") of Assam. They also have a sizable population in Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Nowgong and Karimganj Districts of the Assam State and also Dimapur region of Nagaland state. In Cachar,following the formal conversion of their king Krishna Chandra Hasnusa to Hinduism general Dimasa have largely adopted Hinduism. These new converts to Hinduism are called Barman of Cachar. On the other hand in Nowgong District the Dimasa have come under the influence of Assamese Vishnavism,and there they are called Hojai Kachari (Hojai is also a name of a Dimasa male clan. This term is also stands for the priest). In Dima Hasao district, a section of the Dimasa called Semsas is confined within the historical village named Semkhor,they eventually developed a distinct dialect. Similar minor distinction exists within the Dimasa based on the region they inhabit like Hawarsa, Dembrasa, Hamrisa, Dijuwasa and Hasaosa and Walgongsa.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "8/30/14: Peavy flirts with no-hitter in 3-1 win", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T08:08:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3T1pN3eJfZ8", "description": "Bakshish Mand  \nSales Representative\nOffice: 416-747-9777 | Fax: 416-747-7135\nEmail: b.mand@yahoo.com | www.homelifemiracle.com  \nHomeLife/Miracle Realty Ltd., Brokerage\n470 Chrysler Dr.# 20, Brampton, Ontario", "title": "5 Banda Square Toronto Bakshish Mand", "publishedDate": "2012-12-07T01:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3T27hsEPaSA", "description": "", "title": "Jument 5 ans Calvaro X Darco", "publishedDate": "2013-02-04T08:28:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3T2EafDXlHg", "description": "\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c Fredzislaw100 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c.\n\n00:06 I shown already this version in the past video.\n00:10 It is enough to look to understand: these circuits cannot be realised with DC.\n00:15 I have not put the AC generator into the battery connector.\n00:20 My purpose is to not surprise the people, but to show the principium.\n00:23 So there is a lot of AC in the power line.\n00:28 I only made the circuits more accurate, and have hide the transformer which was so terrible for the people.\n00:35 My video doesn't contains any fakes or hidden parts, you see just which is really.\n00:42 So, the first circuit.\n00:44 Let's try.\n00:53 As you see it works.\n01:00 Now let's make some trick...\n01:03 Let's take the solderer...\n01:09 O-ops...\n01:16 Do you think it will not work now?\n01:18 No, it will.\n00:20 The LEDs in back current works like the Zenner diodes.\n01:29 Now let's change the parallel diodes to serials.\n01:25 Now we can modify the circuit.\n01:48 It works too.\n01:52 And another circuit.\n02:01 As you see it works.\n02:04 Let's change the initially disconnected  switch to initially connected, then will modify the circuit.\n02:10 It will be some short connect.\n02:13 Let's see, nothing lights.\n02:16 But let's disconnect any switch - his LED will light.\n02:36 Let's connect the LED's serially.\n02:41 And again let's disconnect any switch - his LED will light. \n02:46 So all circuits use the identical ideas: to control each LED with one direction of AC.\n02:54 And the parallel diodes are unessential.\n02:58 The flashes of tne LEDs are because the frequence of AC is 50 Hz and video rate is 30 fps.", "title": "\u0410 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044e", "publishedDate": "2012-01-01T15:56:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3T2OsNxFY_w", "description": "C\u00e2y Hoa S\u1eefa Gi\u1ed1ng (Cao 1m \u2013 Ms: 08177): http://caycanhilg.com/cay-hoa-sua/\nXem t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 C\u00e2y Hoa S\u1eefa Gi\u1ed1ng (Cao 1m \u2013 Ms: 08177) t\u1ea1i: http://caycanhilg.com/category/tat-ca-cay-canh-2/cay-hoa-sua/\nHOTLINE: 0938 616 077 -- 0933 482 472\n\nC\u00e2y Hoa S\u1eefa Gi\u1ed1ng (Cao 1m \u2013 Ms: 08177)\n\nC\u00e2y hoa s\u1eefa hay c\u00e2y m\u00f2 cua, c\u00e2y m\u00f9 cua, c\u00f3 t\u00ean khoa h\u1ecdc: Alstonia scholaris L.

I make high level gameplays. I was in August 2013 THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD WITH STIER. Now i play many top accounts. As you know I'm from Quantum's Web so i get many top attacks too. I make base reviews and also I have Town Hall Defense Guides for Town Hall  TH6, TH7, TH8, TH9, and TH10. Be sure to check those strategies out to get a head start on your enemies! Also, I do a daily Let's Play series in full 1080p HD. I'll also replay attacks on my village, including PEKKA, Dragon, Archer, Goblin, Giant, Balloon, Wall Breaker, Barbarian, Wizard, Healer, Barbarian King and Archer Queen attacks. Most importantly, I have numerous attack strategies to go along with my defense strategies for the ultimate Clash of Clans experience. You will find me destroying bad bases, but also full maxed out bases (I have destroyed the top #1 Clasher for example !), you will find me get huge ressources during raids, but you will also see some fail attacks :) I will destroy everything, the townhall, the defenses (Archer towers, canons, teslas, x-bows, wizard towers, air defenses,...)of any levels, the gold mines and elixir pumps, the elixir barracks and the dark ones, and even the builder's hut, to make a full 100% damage raid ! I will also upload some special content and bonuses only for you ! So SUBSCRIBE !\nAlso i will give you tips how you can reach champion without any problems. I'm doing interviews with the best players in the world AND  with great farmers too.\nSo stay tuned and Subscribe please!\n \nThanks to all my subscribers! They deserve all the credit, and they'll be quick to tell you how much they love exclusive iTunes gift card giveaways. I am to quick to post any updates that come out, as well as any glitches and hacks that may appear in the game. I am committed to bringing you guys the best content on YouTube!

Department of Conservation and Recreation\"\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION:\nBuffalo Mountain is one of the most significant natural areas in Virginia. It boasts an amazing 13 rare plant occurences, 3 rare animal occurences, and 6 significant natural communities. The combination of high-elevation (3,971 feet), wind-exposed openings at the summit, and magnesium rich soils make it unlike any place else in the Commonwealth.\n\nOn the treeless summit, strong winds and boreal climate support subalpine vegetation including three-toothed cinquefoil and Rocky Mountain woodsia. The south face of the mountain contains grassy, prairie-like openings composed of wildflowers and native warm-season grasses more typical to the Midwest than to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Wet, magnesium-rich seeps along the base of the mountain support globally rare grasses and wildflowers such as bog bluegrass and large-leaved grass-of-parnassus.\n\nBuffalo Mountain is also the only known location in the world for a mealybug called Puto kosztarabi.\n\nVISITATION:\nPublic access facilities include a small parking area and a steep 1 mile hiking trail to the summit.\n\nPart or all of the preserve may be periodically closed for resource protection or prescribed burning activities.\n\nA preserve guide factsheet and map are available to assist in planning your visit. You will need the Adobe Acrobat reader to view and or print this factsheet.\n\nThe Buffalo Mountain Volunteer Stewardship Committee (BMVSC) is a group of local citizens that assists DCR with stewardship activities at Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve. The BMVSC maintains an informative website with additional site information, photographs, and news of current events.

At night, the sunflower eases back towards the east in preparation for daybreak. Yet these flowers are not responding simply to light, but also to an internal clock, researchers have found. Plant biologists Hagop Atamian and Stacey Harmer of the University of California in Davis grew sunflowers in a field and then transferred them to growth chambers with a fixed overhead light that was always on. The plants continued their daily journey from east to west and back for several days after the transfer, suggesting that they were not responding only to the direction of the light, but their own timekeeper. \"It brings into question whether there's some sort of memory that's found within the plant that allows this regulation,\" says Mark Belmonte, a plant biologist at the University of Mannitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who was not involved with the study. \"This could be a very fine-tuned process.\"\n\nAtamian, who presented the results this week at the annual meeting of the American Society of Plant Biologists in Portland, Oregon, also showed that the sunflowers bend when one side of the stem grows faster than the other (\"Sunflower heliotropism: New insights into a classic phenomenon\" - Hagop Atamian, Harmer lab, Plant Biology Noon, June 24, 1022 Life Sciences). Faster growth on the west side of the stem, for example, causes the plant to bend towards the east. The researchers went on to study gene expression on each side of the plant. Atamian hopes to use this data to learn more about how a sunflower's internal clock can alter growth on one side of the stem but not the other. \"Somehow the same clock in the same organ is having opposite effects on opposite sides of the stem,\" he says. \"It's a big open question.\" Other plants perform a similar diurnal dance, including agriculturally important crops such as soybeans, cotton and alfalfa. Such solar tracking has been shown to boost plant yield. But sunflowers eventually weary of the waltz.

Since I was a kid I ate a lot. I' wasn't fat but my stomach  swelled a lot.  I felt uncomfortable to dress pants or skirts because  all make me look bad and restless.  It wasn't easy because I was addicted to bread and sweets. Food  anxiety make me eat in excess each time I started  a diet.\n\nAfter  week taking  CRAVECUT,  tI was amazed to notice I wasn't hungry.. Something was weird, but my body wasn't asking for sweets or pastries. My hunger loss get me away from cookies and candies and give me energy to start a Low Carb Diet  get to my correct weight and be free of inflammation.\nThis liquid is great for weight loss and eliminate anxiety eating. Get it! Make an attempt for two weeks. This natural product has a kind of magic.\nCrave cut is a natural product. The use of apetite supressant drugs have resulted in Epidemics of fatal pulmonary hypertension and heart valve damage associated with pharmaceutical anorectic agents have led to the withdrawal of products from the market. This was the case with aminorex in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s with fenfluramine (see: Fen-phen). Likewise, association of the related appetite suppressant phenylpropanolamine with hemorrhagic stroke led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request its withdrawal from the market in the United States in 2000, and similar concerns regarding ephedrine resulted in an FDA ban on its inclusion in dietary supplements, in 2004 (a Federal judge later overturned this ban in 2005 during a challenge by supplement maker Nutraceuticals). It is also debatable as to whether the ephedrine ban had more to do with its use as a precursor in methamphetamine manufacture rather than legitimate health concerns.\nThe German and Finnish militaries issued amphetamines to soldiers commonly to enhance warfare during the Second World War. Following the war, amphetamines were redirected for use on the civilian market. Indeed, amphetamine itself was sold commercially as an appetite suppressant until it was outlawed in most parts of the world in the late 1950s due to safety issues. Many amphetamines produce side effects, including addiction, tachycardia and hypertension, making prolonged unsupervised use dangerous.\n\n\nSome appetite suppressants with less drug amount are also available over-the-counter.\nMost common natural appetite suppressants are based on hoodia, a genus of 13 species in the flowering plant family Apocynaceae, under the subfamily Asclepiadoideae. Several appetite suppressants are based on a mix of natural ingredients, mostly using green tea as its basis, in combination with other plant extracts such as fucoxanthin, found naturally in seaweed. Drugs of this class are frequently stimulants of the phenethylamine family, related to amphetamine (informally known as speed).\nCravecut is not made of any of  those ingredientes only with spices.\nCravecut is a totally natural spice\u00a0 that works with only simple and no risk at all spices like an special propietary blend of mustard vinegar, specially prepared garlic, myrtle pepper, turmeric, cloves, barberry, myrtle pepper or allspice, contains the agent known as eugenol, which is what provides resistance not only to fungi but to bacteria and viruses as well.\n\nTurmeric : Curcumin\u00a0 gives turmeric its anti-parasitic properties. \nCloves\u00a0are extremely effective as an anti-fungal spice because also contain eugenol. \nBarberry -\u00a0is a spice that\u00a0 contains berberine, which provides potent anti-fungal properties specially for the treatment of Candida albicans.\nOther spices that also are fungi combatant are : Essential oil of cassia, coriander, thyme, basil, anise, curry leaf, and asafetida that also inhibit fungi.\nCalendula: calendic acid. extracts have anti-viral, anti-genotoxic and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nCravecut doesn't play the game of killing Parasites (for example candidas) it work only scaring and nauseating them.

Even its bridges were packed with faithful.\n\nThe overwhelming majority in the crowd were Poles who had travelled from their home country and immigrant communities as far afield as Chicago and Sydney to watch their most famous native son, John Paul, become a saint.\n\nHundreds of red and white Polish flags filled the square and the streets surrounding the Vatican, which were strewn with sleeping bags, backpacks and folding chairs. It was one of the biggest crowds since John Paul's beatification in 2011.\n\nJohn XXIII, who reigned from 1958 to 1963 and called the modernising Second Vatican Council, and John Paul II, the Pole who reigned for nearly 27 years, played leading roles on the world stage.\n\nFrancis's own huge popularity has added extra appeal to the unprecedented ceremony to raise two former leaders of the church to sainthood on the same day.\n\nBut while both were widely revered, there has also been criticism that John Paul II, who only died nine years ago, has been canonised too quickly.", "title": "Sainthood for John Paul II, John XXIII - Historic Papal Canonisation 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T09:42:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TPy7SmMIGg", "description": "SHAMELESS JOURNALISM in UTTRAKHAND , Has Journalism in INDIA gone to such low ? watch it to witness the shamelessness of a Journalist ...just to get the TRP's ?

Per crederci, basti pensare che al 30\u2032 del primo tempo avevamo in tabellino una sola azione, quella che all'11\u2032 aveva portato lo Spallanzani in vantaggio, grazie a un intervento poco felice del portiere Amato sul tiro del numero 9, Piacentini. A 10 minuti dalla fine della prima frazione di gioco, per\u00f2, finalmente abbiamo visto la gara animarsi: prima, la formazione biancorossa trova il raddoppio con Maschietti che, da solo sulla sinistra, supera tre avversari, si presenta davanti all'estremo difensore dell'Anco Marzio e firma il 2-0. Poi, arriva la reazione degli studenti in maglia rosa: al 33\u2032 pt Mancini tutto spostato sulla destra sorprende Tomei sul palo pi\u00f9 lontano ed \u00e8 2-1. Lo Spallanzani non ci sta e, dopo 5 minuti, allunga di nuovo con Di Lorenzo, ottimamente lanciato a rete da Falcioni. L'Anco Marzio, mai domo, non solo pesca il 3-2 un secondo prima che l'arbitro Funari fischi la fine del primo tempo con un tiro di Di Mario da cineteca, ma riesce anche a pareggiare all'inizio della ripresa con Fabiani, bravo ad approfittare di un liscio clamoroso della difesa biancorossa. Al 13\u2032 st si fa male il portiere Amato, al suo posto coraggiosamente, prende i guantoni Galassi che, pochi minuti pi\u00f9 tardi, viene chiamato in causa da Di Lorenzo.

In my research over the last five years, I have interviewed nearly 200 scientists and physicians, as well as countless patients, a few lawyers and a handful of government officials. I have amassed a roomful of books on pain and hundreds upon hundreds of scientific papers.\n\nI have found that there is an appalling mismatch between what people in pain need and what doctors know. Out of 238 million adult Americans, 100 million live in chronic pain. Yet most doctors know almost nothing about it, much less how to treat it. Doctors get only 9 hours of pain education throughout four years of medical school. Even veterinarians get more.\n\nThe government, specifically the National Institutes of Health, isn't much better. It spends only about one percent of its vast -- $358 million -- yearly budget on pain research, despite the fact that chronic pain is a bigger problem than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. Indeed, federal spending on chronic pain is actually going down.\n\nCulture wars over prescription painkillers play into all this, too. I discovered that opioids (narcotics) are like airplane food -- not great, but hard to get enough of if you are a legitimate pain patient. And all too easy to get if you are a street abuser. Tragically, politics still means the government -- and the press -- focus more on punishing abusers than helping patients. Yes, there are roughly 16,000 opioid-related deaths a year, but the press rarely notes that only 29 percent of these involve opioids alone, without alcohol or benzodiazepines. Amid all the prescription painkiller hysteria, the press also pays little attention to the 7,000 to 10,000 deaths a year from NSAIDS, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.\n\nI got into all this the hard way, with excruciating neck pain that came on, seemingly out of the blue, a few years ago. I am better now. I did what you'll read about in the second half of this book -- opioids, NSAIDS, physical therapy, exercise (lots), meditation, acupuncture, massage, steroid injections, Botox . I learned that nothing really cures pain, but that lots of things can help a little, and that adding them all together can decrease it a bit more.\n\nI have come to believe that the failure to better manage pain borders on \"torture by omission.\" Many people -- whose stories are in the book -- can't get rid of their pain altogether, yet still manage to live extremely fulfilling lives.\n\nWhatever your pain now -- or the pain of someone you love -- I hope you read this book to better understand your pain and fight for the care you need.", "title": "Judy Foreman \"A Nation In Pain\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T05:01:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TV4xFGleEE", "description": "The check sheet is a tool for gathering information on the root cause of the defects.

The gig is a pronged and barbed spearhead forged out of steel. It is attached to the end of a long pole and used to spear fish. Gig fishing at night is an old tradition in Shannon County, and a good gig, such as the one Ray Hicks is making, is a prized possession. Like many hunting and fishing traditions, gig fishing grew out of the necessity to eat and feed one's family. After working all day in the timber or at farming, men would go out on the rivers at night and fish. Night gigging is done from special flat-bottomed boats rigged with gaslights. The boat has to be able to navigate shallow waters, yet be heavy and stable enough not to move from under the gigger when the gig is thrown. The gig itself must be shaped and tempered just right. The gig has to pass through a fish without tearing the fish apart and the barbs must hold the fish tightly enough to pull it out of the water, yet cleanly release the fish into the boat when the pole is given a quick jerk. The gig also has to be flexible enough not to break when it hits rocks, but hard enough to hold its point. It takes many hours, a lot of hard work, and considerable skill to make a gig. The metal must be heated to different temperatures depending on the task. Welding, which fuses the metal, requires the highest temperatures; simple bending requires the lowest. Hicks can work on the gig only a minute or two at a time before having to reheat it in the forge. This series of camera rolls shows all of the steps involved in making a gig form beginning to end. The rolls are numbered in the order they were shot. Footage shot on June 7, 1979, in Shannon County, Missouri. \n\nPart of the raw footage recorded 1978-1979 for the 1981 documentary motion pictures \"Shannon County: Home\" and \"Shannon County: Hearts of the Children.\" Located in Special Collections, Meyer Library, Missouri State University.\n\nFor more information on the Shannon County Film Digitization Project: http://purl.missouristate.edu/library/archives/shannon/scfindingaid", "title": "Camera Roll 367 - Shannon County Film Digitization Project", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T23:38:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Te9cD2FrIc", "description": "Carrousel 2012 Ablon", "title": "Carrousel Ablon 2012 tonneau carambolage", "publishedDate": "2012-10-12T19:23:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TeCGw7hKVM", "description": "Fishing in Greece with kabura pagrus ehrenberg", "title": "Fishing in Greece with kabura pagrus ehrenberg", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T05:07:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TeXM2k6q_c", "description": "Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MariahRaw\n\nMariah Carey & John Legend - With You I'm Born Again", "title": "Mariah Carey & John Legend - With You I'm Born Again", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T00:04:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TeXYdQk8K0", "description": "Get more of the hottest, funniest and outright crazy vids! \nSubscribe  ? http://bit.ly/ZOOtube_subscribe\n\nJordan Carver BUSTS her shirt open, HD\n\nGet more ZOO:\nwww.zooweekly.com.au\nwww.facebook.com/ZOOWeeklyOz\nhttps://twitter.com/ZooWeeklyAus\nhttp://instagram.com/zooweeklydigital\n\nSee more Jordan Carver:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JCMwebTV/videos\nhttp://www.modeljordancarver.com\nhttp://instagram.com/jordancarverofficial\nhttps://twitter.com/jordancarver\n\nDownload ZOO magazine\nApple ? http://bit.ly/zoomag_itunes\nAndroid ? http://bit.ly/zoo_mag_google\n\nGet more of the hottest, funniest and outright crazy vids! \nSubscribe  ? http://bit.ly/ZOOtube_subscribe\n\nLIKE / SHARE / COMMENT", "title": "Jordan Carver BUSTS her shirt open, HD", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T23:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3TemGWRq0QA", "description": "Three Songs, for voice and piano(arranged from Fa\u00e7ade)\nEdith Sitwell\n\nII.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Clemson's Stoudt Completes Pass Without An O-Line | ACC Must See Moment", "publishedDate": "2014-11-22T23:37:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Tf50O65N3Q", "description": "Cortes de pelo cara redonda \nhttp://firstsaletoday.com/go/hairstyle-books", "title": "Cortes de pelo cara redonda", "publishedDate": "2013-11-19T22:43:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Tflt2q78Ts", "description": "Learner Driving Centres (LDC): This short video from Learner Driving Centres explains what you should expect on your DVSA Hazard Perception Test. \nhttp://www.learnerdriving.com/\n\nOver 600 hazard clips are available for you to test yourself in realistic examination conditions on LDC's software products for PCs.

This approach only fosters dependency, doubt and blind obedience, such that once the test is passed they do all the things they were told not to do. The LDC approach is designed to foster self-reliance, confidence and responsibility resulting in safer drivers who learn to drive far more quickly.\n\nUnlike traditional instruction LDC heavily promotes student centred learning. This involves the student being encouraged to take more responsibility for their own development by using the LD System materials before and after each lesson and by using discovery learning with self determination and reflection rather than being told what to do by the instructor. In particular talk through instruction, prompted practice and long winded explanations are avoided, if at all possible - instead encouraging the student to work it out for themselves.

How can an anonymous tunnel be turned into a space full of meaning? By transporting the visitors, mentally at least, to a different place. The tunnel on the Tugelaweg - a long, rectangular tube with no columns - is ideal for this kind of temporary experience that completely immerses you. Like huge screens, you can view the two, forty-metre-long walls as windows: as man-sized windows that will give you a glimpse of another world that you can become part of. And it is here that we will be telling stories from the animal world.\n\nFrom top to bottom and front to back, both of these tunnel walls are to be fully equipped with LED strips comprising 12,000 dazzling, white lights. In front of these lights, we will place a screen of (vandal-proof) frosted, tempered glass with a natural, reed-like pattern on the visible side. In principle, all the LEDs will be fully illuminated for 24 hours a day. But within this profusion of light, a series of contours will be seen shifting across areas where the LEDs have been turned off. These will look like the contours of animals that are moving right behind the ripples in the glass. Here, a story is being told with light, or rather with the absence of light: through shadows. \n\nThe animal world that will be seen here comes from the Transvaal in South Africa. It comprises \"the big five\": the elephant, the rhino, the lion, the buffalo and the leopard. And just as on safari, we - the people - are mere visitors. If you're lucky, you may see a grazing buffalo, a leopard that has just woken up or an elephant lifting its head. If you're unlucky, you will see nothing at all: just light. What we experience here is the slowness and capriciousness of the daily lives of animals. This will not be some spectacular, television format animal documentary but a life-size copy of animal life that can continue to intrigue over a prolonged period of time. It will be a layered image that is sometimes evocative of the shadow plays of Indonesian wayang puppets, yet also reminds us of the primitiveness of prehistoric cave paintings or a lucid dream, a dream without colour. This will be a place where we can all read our own animal stories.", "title": "INTO THE SHADOW - 3rd movie", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T09:47:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3UCs9errHDY", "description": "Pre-Order the DVD here: http://store.veggietales.com\n\nGet a sneak peek at the new Silly Song with Larry.

The main goal of this project is to prove that simplicity truly is the highest form of sophistication. The project features production from ILL tal, Cito on the beat, with Hot Mop Films and Kristopher Rey-Talley providing the visuals for the songs. This project is unique in many ways. Firstly, every song will be released by the release date of August 17th by way of video without the download option. Then on the date of release every song and video will be digitally packaged and made available for download via TheILLZ.com and online blogs/sites. Secondly, almost every song in this project consists of one verse with no chorus, with the exception of the first release &quot;Dreams of Life &amp; Beth&quot;. Lastly, the videos were met with the same approach. Minimal editing and shots. It was the collective effort and goal of The ILLZ, Kristopher Rey-Talley, and Hot Mop Films to create moving visuals for the songs on this project that embodied the same minimalist approach.

For Calcium this light is red but, as Debbie says, her sample of CaCl2 may have had some traces of NaCl in it.  Na  gives off yellow/orange light (you can see it in some street lamps) and Na is more volatile than Ca so even a little in her sample could nearly swamp the colour of the calcium in the flame.\n\nSee our 24 reactions playlist as it unfolds at: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6E4F35510525FFF7\n\nBerzelius Day explained: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDXUDq2KLM4\n\nMore chemistry at http://www.periodicvideos.com/\nFollow us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/periodicvideos\nAnd on Twitter at http://twitter.com/periodicvideos\nFrom the School of Chemistry at The University of Nottingham: http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/chemistry/index.aspx\n\nPeriodic Videos films are by video journalist Brady Haran\nhttp://www.bradyharan.com/", "title": "Calcium Chloride in Bunsen Flame (reaction only)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T21:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "3U_kuMfyV3E", "description": "BOOK NOW! \"http://www.GTAstrings.ca  647 707 0348\nToronto String Quartet, Trio, Duo.

The list goes on and on.\n\nThey require a very dedicated human and a very compliant dog to put them on.\n\nMost dogs when it is time to put on their harness are so excited that they are going somewhere, that standing still and letting you snap three or so clips around them is just a pain in the butt.\n\nWhile In Europe I Found The Best Dog Harness I Ever Saw\n\nWhile on vacation in Denmark I came across a dog harness that only required a simple click to get on your dog. The brand is Hurtta. The trouble was I had to go to a vet to get it as that was the only place one could purchase it at the time.\n\nAs you can see here, I used the hell out of them. And since I could not easily buy them again, I had to do repairs.\n\nWell as you can see here, it was time to replace them, I think these were like seven years old.\n\nYou Can Now Get A Hurtta Dog Harness Here In The USA\n\nWe had heard that now in Europe you could just get them at a regular pet store as Hurtta had expanded their sales outlets. \n\nI looked into them on line and I am happy to say you can get them through Amazon now!\nThis was great! I ordered a new dog harness for each of my dogs. \n\nThe nice thing about these with their new design is that they have very powerful reflectors built into the materials of the harness. The padding is nice and thick for your doggies comfort. This dog harness is my favorite that I have ever come across.\n\nI hope you and your dogs enjoy your dog harness on many occasions.\n\nThanks for listening\n\nJohn Radin\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UdozaWBF20&feature=youtu.be\n\nYou can find a review of this product on my site at:\n\nhttp://norse.empowernetwork.com/blog/best-dog-harness-in-the-world", "title": "Best Dog Harness In The World", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T15:39:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Ue_utx_YDc", "description": "Kheymet lalla le royaume des caftans sur commande......\nKheymet lalla the leader in high fashion Moroccan...\nAdresse: coop\u00e9ratif immobilier en bande Bordj elbahri-Alger Alg\u00e9rie.\nMobile:+213 771 76 57 58\nRejoignez nous sur facebook et twitter / kheymetlalla.\nkheymetlalla@hotmail.fr\nkheymetlalla@gmail.com", "title": "La ceinture du caftan.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-05-07T21:52:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Ueg7Q7hO7U", "description": "http://gags.justforlaughs.com | Subscribe:  http://goo.gl/wJxjG\n\nThe postal delivery men has been replaced by the postal delivery dog.
