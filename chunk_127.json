And so when the latest round of fighting in the city began last week, they fled to the airport, hoping the soldiers would offer them protection. We landed at M'Poko five days later.\n\nThe sectarian fighting that has led CAR, one of the poorest countries in the world, to the brink of collapse began last March when Michel Djotodia and his loose rebel alliance (known as the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka) stormed Bangui and ousted President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9. Djotodia appointed himself president and tried to integrate the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka into the armed forces, but it didn't work. Even Djotodia admitted that he didn't have control over most of the rebels, many of whom are said to be mercenaries from neighboring Chad and Sudan.\n\nBands of mostly Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels are now terrorizing the majority Christian country, raping and murdering civilians as they roam. Civilians have formed their own \"anti-balaka\" militias \u2014 balaka means machete or sword \u2014 to fight back. Meanwhile, many of those who aren't fighting have sought refuge in the only places they consider safe: houses of worship. And the Muslim civilian minority fears reprisals by the anti-balaka forces after nine months of S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rule.\n\nIt's important to note that many people with firsthand knowledge of the war have told us that the religious aspect of the conflict \u2014 Muslim rebels vs. Christian civilians \u2014 is overblown. They say this is not an ideological war, but rather a war of identity that goes back generations. Regardless of the root causes, the United Nations and other prominent NGOs speculate that the situation could become far worse.\n\nRead the full article on VICE.com here: http://www.vice.com/read/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic\n\nSubscribe to VICE News now: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nhttp://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/", "title": "Crisis in the Central African Republic: Dispatch One", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T16:07:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-9FsAfEsHA", "description": "Hanging out with the Peterson siblings in South Africa....", "title": "Human Pack horse", "publishedDate": "2010-07-30T04:10:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-9M235wti8", "description": "", "title": "How-To Tie Garbage Bundles For Pick-Up By Sanitation", "publishedDate": "2014-05-29T15:53:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-9R2h_lkEs", "description": "G\u0435t a gr\u0435at d\u0435al \u043en \u0430maz\u043en.\u0441\u043em http://bit.ly/1e1oz3e  \n\nDigital Voice Recorder\nEdic-Mini Tiny16 U49 600hr 4Gb - New unique development that combines the best recording quality and powerful energy saving technology.

The seat has higher padded blocks, front & back, that will feel snug around the seat and legs. The stirrups can be raised high enough to fit you, so your legs do not just dangle. This will also enable you to start learning to balance yourself, instead of someone having to constantly hold your arm or leg to keep you from drifting off to the side as the horse walked. This will definitely change your courage!  You will also wear riding helmets, boots and jeans - proper attire. Hoods are great to keep those little feet from slipping through the stirrups, which are correct size, too. You MUST secure both sides (two straps each side) properly! One thing is that securing the upper strap through the saddle ring (where the latigo attaches) & the lower strap through the girth ring prevented side-to-side drift.\nHerm Sprenger System 4 Stirrups, 122-55 4 3/4 [Misc.]-Product Features\nStrong Dees for hanging saddle bags and water bottles\nFleece lined bottom offers great comfort\nChoose from available colour options\nHerm Sprenger System 4 Stirrups, 122-55 4 3/4 [Misc.]-Product Pros\nThe seat is comfy\nYou ride close to your horse\nThe front and back bevel will keep you from sliding forward or back on rough terrain and hills.\nHerm Sprenger System 4 Stirrups, 122-55 4 3/4 [Misc.]-Product Cons\nSecuring the upper strap through the saddle ring (where the latigo attaches) & the lower strap through the girth ring prevented side-to-side drift.\nHerm Sprenger System 4 Stirrups, 122-55 4 3/4 [Misc.] Customers Reviews\nOne of the recent customers of Herm Sprenger System 4 Stirrups, 122-55 4 3/4 [Misc.] said, \"I love these stirrups!

Ukraine is making fresh allegations of yet another military intrusion across its eastern border? \nThat\u2032s right. And it\u2032s fading what little glimmer of hope was gained in those talks... to end the five months\u2032 long war raging between Kiev\u2032s forces and pro-Russian separatists.\nOur Yoo Li-an reports. \nThe House of Culture in the eastern Ukraine rebel stronghold of Donetsk, consumed in fire.\nWhile some fled, some stayed to examine the damage.\nLocals there say the fire killed one and left a few others wounded.\nThis comes as Ukraine accused Russia of new military incursions on Wednesday,... the latest development in five months of fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-separatists rebels. \nRussia has constantly denied accusations it is supplying weapons and sending soldiers to help the rebel forces.\nNo reaction yet from Moscow on the alleged incursion. \nThis latest escalation comes only a day after hours of talks between the two countries\u2032 presidents seemed to mark a turning point in a five-month old crisis.\nUkrainian President Petro Proshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin along with EU representatives met on Tuesday in Minsk. \n\"Yesterday\u2032s talks in Minsk were very effective. At the talks, I clearly stressed that there will be no bargaining over sovereignty, territorial integrity, the independence of our country, the sovereign choice of the Ukrainian people.\"\nFollowing the talks, Putin also said Moscow will contribute to create a situation of trust.\nBut hopes the war that\u2032s killed over 22-hundred had hit a turning point,... are quickly fading from Wednesday\u2032s attack.\nAlso less that 24 hours since the Minsk meeting, Ukraine warned Europe that Russia plans to halt gas transit to Europe by the end of the year. \nRussia denied the claims saying it is making maximum efforts to fulfill its contracts with Europe.\nYoo Li-an, Arirang News.", "title": "Ukraine accuses Russia of new military incursion , dampening hopes of breakthrou", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T04:37:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-JMGLTwhA0", "description": "A Russian Fatalistic tale about robots.\n\nRoyalty Free Song can be found at:\n http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/339553/eraplee-noisewall-orchestra", "title": "Robot Fatalism", "publishedDate": "2012-08-14T20:38:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-JtS8IauzU", "description": "Staff Sergeant Michael Devaughn talks about his experiences as a MP in the Army Reserve.

Americans do it as well as pretty much anybody, but the Canadians are well known for it to. Rye is a very hardy crop that grows better in cold climates. While it's difficult to distill because there are proteins in the mash that will make it stick together and turn what will be delicious liquor into oatmeal. \n\nIt's a little harder to work with, but it's a very delicious grain. It's light, spicy. You have producers that will do very high proof, very oily and very aggressive. You have producers that will do lighter and softer rye whiskeys almost drinks more like a bourbon. So there is a wide variety in your styles of rye. You can even have your white whiskey say this is an un-aged whiskey directly from the still. It smells a little bit like gasoline, it smells a lot like gasoline, but corn will do that in your mash bill. Rye whiskeys are 51% rye in the mash bill at the least to be called straight rye whiskey. \n\nThey'll add other grains barley, wheat, corn to make it softer or sweeter or a little more rounded, but it means it's at least 51% rye. Those are some facts about rye whiskey.", "title": "What Is Rye Whiskey? | Whiskey Guide", "publishedDate": "2014-03-11T11:04:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-NhlzIjdss", "description": "", "title": "Taylor swift - style Lyrics", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T15:24:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-O0CNZHcTg", "description": "The last few years have shown no paucity of scandal for Mr Tiwari.

Of paramount importance is trusting the instructor. I've realized over the years from feedback from parents that the instructor definitely has an influence over the child and the way he behaves. So feeling comfortable with that is really important for parents. \n\nWhat the kids will get from karate is probably quite something different from any other activity they'll do. Because doing karate they enter a different world, different  disciplines, different rituals, and also a hierarchy that perhaps doesn't exist outside of the karate world so much these days. Through this hierarchy knowing that they've got seniors in the class, knowing that they have to respect those seniors, and listen to perhaps any advice that they might get given is really key, I think, for the kids going up through the ranks. \n\nI start my kids at six. Some places have them younger. I find that under six, you know, knowing their left from their right, being able to do the technical things is lacking some times. Although occasionally I'll take an exceptional child. Over six they can start to grasp the technical aspects. \n\nI always teach proper karate. You know, it's not a games class. And I think making karate very user friendly by making it into games is perhaps not the impression that the kids should have. They need to know that this is not play time, and it's quite serious. I'm pretty serious with my kids. I joke with them as well, but when I'm serious they know it and they behave themselves. When they're good I praise them. \n\nSo I think having this balance and having this somewhat stern environment can be good for the kids. When they take their gradings, this is not for six months that they might take a test or go up the ranks. So they learn a sort of delayed gratification, and when they pass a test they really know they've earned it. Instead of doing something little and they get a reward, they have to wait a very long time in some cases. So there's a sense of self worth when they pass their test because they know that it was an achievement. I think that's a very good thing that traditional karate classes bring.", "title": "How to Pick Karate Lessons for Kids | Karate Lessons", "publishedDate": "2012-04-04T16:47:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-OzlqQEbO0", "description": "ANARCHO PUNK", "title": "DETESTATION the inhuman condition", "publishedDate": "2009-07-28T00:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-P9n6ORL_I", "description": "Visit the official site: http://itv.com/xfactor\n\n17-year-old Lauren's song is the hauntingly fantastic Dark Horse, originally by Katy Perry.

Representative Lee Seok-ki of the Unified Progressive Party (the UPP), along with six other individuals, were convicted last May of criminal acts related to a speech given by Representative Lee in which he warned of US aggression on the peninsula and considered what would happen in the outbreak of war, which he argued the US wanted. Based solely on his speech, Representative Lee was found guilty by a South Korean trial court on February 17, 2014 of three different charges, all stemming from the contents of his speech.  On August 11, 2014, the Court of Appeal dismissed a charge that alleged that Representative Lee had formed a \u201crevolutionary organization,\u201d but maintained the guilty verdicts for attempting to incite violence through his speech, as well as violations of the National Security Act charges.

You are supposed to use it to stun certain people and enslave them via a slave collar that Grouse gives you. However, there are a few other things the Mesmetron can do, often for comedic effect and sometimes even to help you complete a quest (obviously other than \"Strictly Business\").\n\nEDIT: You get no karma loss for stealing stuff as far as I know. Very strange as stealing so much as bent tins from owners shelves or bins nets you a karma loss. However, fitting them with a slave collar means a large karma loss, no matter how nice you are to them afterwards. You get no karma loss if people attack and kill a berserk person but if the head exploding effect takes place, that will count as killing them, and any karma gain/loss will take effect depending on who you kill. Simply mezzing someone will not cause a drop in karma.\n\nEDIT: The green stick is the Repellant Stick that Moria gives you to complete a part of the wasteland survival guide. She didn't take it off me, but if she steals yours, use cheats if you desperately want it.\n\nEDIT: Choose the second option with a slave collar in your inventory when you speak to a mezzed victim in order to fit them with one.\n\nEDIT: The mesmetron should have an effect on your target. Make sure it hits for starters (the shot hits the target directly and doesn't skim it), save before you mezz and patch your game if still nothing happens.  It makes no difference which part of the body you hit, just as long as you hit your target.\n\nEDIT: An NPC stands for Non Playable Character and is self explanatory.\n\nEDIT: You can get the Mesmetron by killing Grouse but you cannot complete the \"Strictly Business\" quest if you do so. The quest reward is only to gain entry into Paradise Falls, and so if you kill Grouse, you cannot get slave collars from him. If you lose or sell the mesmetron, you cannot find it at a second location. You must either find the one you lost, or get it again by a console command. It is the following within the brackets. (player.additem 00004339 1)\n\nEDIT. Ok, let me make this clear. Maybe the people going berserk isn't a glitch, but the fact that you get away with murder is! \n\nEDIT: You can get more ammo from Grouse, although at an expensive price. You can also find it lying around, but these are few and far between.\n\nEDIT: The berserk effect is open to discussion. I personally think it is a glitch, as there is a lot of evidence to support this. The manual states that \"Assault: Attacking someone without provocation results in a major crime\" which is when everyone becomes hostile to you. If the berserk effect occurs, nobody becomes hostile except the victim, who if killed, everyone else returns to their duties rather than punish you for causing it. However, the berserk thing does not occur all the time, as I have used it a few times and everyone turned hostile towards me without any other effects. Also, it could be that the programmers did not program it properly, saw this effect and thought it was so funny they decided to keep it in the game. Or it could be they actually programmed it to do this, going against their vision of a lifelike Fallout universe and the statements in the manual being a lie. So morons that enjoy disagreeing with me can eat this and maybe think about their argument in a bit more depth, as they aren't the game designers either.\n\nEDIT: Save before you mezz someone and do not holster your weapon when you go up to speak to your victim.  Each effect of the mesmetron has a percentage chance of happening. There is a list of NPC that can never be mezzed, and instead have an increased chance of going berserk. Mezz them from behind, definitely not when they're attacking you and don't use VATS for best results. That's all the advice I can offer about successful stuns with the mesmetron.\n\nEDIT: Try mezzing unnamed characters. They are most likely to be mezzed and/or enslaved. Try using it while hidden and while the target is unarmed. Some named characters can be mezzed though. Even hostile characters such as raiders and talon mercs can be mezzed, although you will need to sneak up on them.\n\nI know there are other videos on Youtube about this weapon but they don't include a minigun wielding villager wearing a skimpy night dress, do they?

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

It is aesthetically pleasing, heat reflective and durable. Its thickness and non slip texture means that swimming pool areas, paving and patios are all areas where sandstone creates an interesting decorating environment. Indian sandstone is extremely versatile. It can be sawn, honed, polished, sandblasted, and brushed for use in flooring and walling. Sandstone is available in many shapes and colors and is easily available in large quantities. The most commonly used shade are rippon, golden brown, raj green, autumn brown, fossil mint and modak.

I'm Jeff. This is my boy Jared right here. We're going to show you how to do a hinge kick. It's going to look pretty tough, but once we break it down, it's going to be pretty easy. So you want to try it? All right. This is what you're going to do. You're going to come down to the floor. You're sitting in this position. You notice my heels are up, and I'm going to just throw my hands back. I'm going to break it down really slow for you, so I'm going to start with the hands first.\n\nI'm going to throw my hand back behind my body like this. Now, my hands have to be pretty far away from my body, not too close. You got it? Let's do it. You're going to throw your hands back like this, pretty far away from your body. Now there's one more important thing with throwing the arms back. When I throw my arms back, I bend my elbows so that it doesn't hurt. This is going to probably hurt your first time. Not probably, it's going to hurt. So back to the front. We're going to throw our hands back like this. Ready? Look. Boom, and I bend my elbow. That's the cushion. That cushion is going to help me push back in, so this is how I come back in later. Watch. Push. Got it? You need your elbows, so don't forget that.\n\nNow, we're going to throw our arms back, and then we're going to do the feet. We're going to do it on one, two, so it looks like this. Six, seven, eight, hands one, feet two. Got it? So let's try the arms and the legs at the same time. Come back in. So again, I'm up on my heels. Heels up off the floor. I'm going to do the arms and the legs at the same time, it looks like this. Got it? Simple enough.\n\nAll right, so let's try this. So we're going to do hands, legs, same time. Five, six, seven, eight. Now in a hitch kick, one of your legs is going to be in the air. We're going to try the right. Ready, Jared? Let's just throw up the right so you see what it looks like in the air. It's like this, and your arms are bent. This is what you want to get. We're going to start from the beginning and get to this, and then we'll show you how to get up from this. Bring it in. Big kick up, ready? Looks like this. Five, six, seven, eight, kick up. So you kicked, and your leg is in the air. Now, to get in from this, that's why you have your arms here. So you're going to push. You ready, Jared?\n\nWe're going to push just from here, so you go in on one, six, seven, eight, that's how you come back in. When you put it all together, it looks like this.

Our stove is made by CFM home products, and was purchased from Lowes. A Epa certified air tight, with secondary air inlets in the top of the fire box, allowing the high efficiency after burn. This technology allows a more complete burn, and less wasted energy going up the flue. Steel construction with a cast iron door, fire brick lined fire box, and a window for awesome fire viewing. A 6 inch flue connected to a 8x8 masonary chimney. The blower set-up I did uses a Dayton blower with a thermostat mounted to the heat shield,  and a rheostat mounted on the wall to control the speed of the fan. When designing and constructing the hearth area I built a woodbox that is refillable from in the garage to cut down on the mess of bringing the wood thru the house. The stove has allowed us to save hundreds of dollars in heating costs.  We enjoy burning wood, and I grew up with my parents having one. The work at the wood pile is worth it, when you can enjoy a nice fire! Thanks for watching, and enjoy in HD if you can. Please add me to your friends list and subscribe.

Infant colic is often defined by the Wessel's criteria of crying or fussing for three hours or more a day for three days or more per week for three weeks in infants aged less than 3 months. Although infant colic spontaneously resolves after the first three to four months after birth, it is associated with maternal depression, early breastfeeding cessation, and shaken baby syndrome. Infant distress is one of the most common presenting problems to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare sectors, costing the UK healthcare system millions of pounds annually.\n\nThe cause of infant colic remains elusive despite decades of research. Psychosocial hypotheses include poor maternal-infant interactions, maternal anxiety and depression, and difficult infant temperament. Gastrointestinal theories include increased intra-abdominal gas, hyperperistalsis, and visceral pain. One study has suggested that infants with colic may have increased faecal calprotectin levels, suggesting a possible role for gut inflammation; however, another study suggested no differences in faecal calprotectin levels between infants with and infants without colic.\n\nNo single effective treatment for colic exists, and most clinical guidelines recommend support and reassurance as the mainstay of management. The use of hypoallergenic formulas or elimination of cow's milk protein from the diet of mothers who are breast feeding may possibly be effective, yet not all irritable infants respond. Anticholinergic drugs, for example, dicycloverine, are effective but have potentially dangerous side effects, including breathing difficulties and coma. An effective, practical, and acceptable intervention for infant colic would represent a major advance in clinical and public health.\n\nRecently, research into the use of probiotics for colic has been rapidly gaining momentum. Infants with colic are reported to have increased concentrations of gas forming organisms and proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli in their gut. Colonisation with certain intestinal micro-organisms, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, along with increased intestinal microbial diversity, may protect against infant distress. Probiotics enhance the mucosal barrier and promote microbial diversity in the gut. They may reduce concentrations of proteobacteria and gas forming coliform and reduce intestinal inflammation. A recent meta-analysis of three small, randomised controlled trials of breastfed infants with colic reported that Lactobacillus reuteri noticeably reduced crying time at 21 days post supplementation. However, one trial was unblinded, two included only infants with mothers on dairy-free diets, and none used validated measures of infant distress. No trials have included formula fed infants, which is relevant because colic is associated with early breastfeeding cessation. Despite these major limitations, the use of probiotics for colic has been rapidly taken up internationally. An urgent need exists for a larger, more rigorous trial that includes infants unselected for feeding method to clarify whether L reuteri is effective for infant colic in the general population.\n\nWe determined whether the probiotic L reuteri DSM 17938 benefited infants aged less than 3 months with colic, irrespective of feeding mode. We also examined its effect on gut microbiota, faecal calprotectin levels, and E coli colonisation, all implicated in the mechanism of disease. \n\nRead the results of the trial:\nTreating infant colic with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri: double blind, placebo controlled randomised trial http://goo.gl/peM4aD", "title": "Treating infant colic with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T11:25:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "70MYB9b2Vj8", "description": "http://www.kayumanis.com/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/kayumanisresorts\nhttp://twitter.com/KayumanisResort\n\nFamous for its stretches of long white sandy beaches and upscale resort facilities, Nusa Dua is also home to the exclusive world of Kayumanis.

This region has seen the fastest and most intense development in the last ten years, mostly high-rise residential towers.\n\nRapid and un-checked development has also resulted in massive destruction of forest cover, mangroves and conversion of fertile agricultural land to build-able land. You can clearly see the drastic change between the years 2009 and 2011, when the residential development market peaked before the slowdown.\n\nThis stretch of highway between Mumbai and Nasik is undergoing massive urbanization with well-known developers on the scene now.

This will build self discipline and commitment to getting these small tasks done. \n\nOnce you develop one habit you should celebrate your success so you feel good about achieving your goal.\n\nNext focus on adding another goal to discipline yourself to achieve. Slowly you will start building the discipline to tackle each goal that you set.\n\nSoon you will have the discipline to go after any goal you set your mind to. By focusing on small wins that work towards a big win you will keep going and will avoid giving up to early.\n\nThis is exactly how I disciplined myself in business, going to the gym and getting things done in day to day life.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70eAVbIlN9g", "title": "Discipline- Learn To Develop Discipline To Get More Done", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T13:48:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "70eHXG9C288", "description": "Started as a visitor to Malaysia, now there are many of such birds in the vast open country", "title": "Egret, Cattle in breeding plumage -Bubulcus ibis.flv", "publishedDate": "2010-03-31T05:49:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "70eU840lc38", "description": "Clay Davis is arguably the most compelling character from HBO's the wire.

(If you just let it sit in the toilet bowel until you have a bowel movement, then the urine can start to smell up your bathroom, and your garden or compost would be missing out on a great source of liquid nitrogen.)\n\nTry it.... it is much easier, cleaner, and normal than you might think.", "title": "Urine Composting: Compost your Pee", "publishedDate": "2009-09-19T20:49:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "70gVLFNDIUM", "description": "Holy Spirit+ You Are So Good To Me at the end Check Out Our iTunes Link http://itunes.apple.com/album/id909146159", "title": "Holy Spirit (Jesus Culture, Bryan and Katie Torwalt) Worship Cover Cedar Valley", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T01:11:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "70gZqMzHsmY", "description": "Please visit us at  http://www.TreasureMountainMining.com to see this and over 2,000 more fine mineral specimens", "title": "3.6\" Super Saturated Blue Streak Gem HALITE Crystal Section Carlsbad NM for sale", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T13:03:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "70gdLTzpWIA", "description": "From Discipleship to Apostleship Book Trailer\nBook by Tim Ranyak", "title": "From Discipleship to Apostleship (Book Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-20T06:06:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "70hGrE8G1e4", "description": "Brand new luxury construction in Teton Pines!

Little information exists on dosages. An essential oil can be prepared from red cedar. This oil is meant to be used topically. It is toxic if taken internally, and has the ability to produce convulsions or even death if taken in even small quantities. A 1999 study done in Switzerland noted an increase in poisoning deaths from plant products, including Thuja, due possibly to an increase in people practicing herbal healing and aromatherapy.\n\nPrecautions:As noted above, the oil of all species of thuja can cause convulsions. Decoctions of the bark of red cedar can also cause miscarriage. Therefore, pregnant women should not use red cedar.\n\nSide Effects:Many people develop asthma and bronchial spasms from exposure to red cedar or red cedar dust. This is due to an allergic reaction to plicatic acid present in the wood.

Brands may vary in dosage and strength. Always check with a physician before starting an herbal regimen.\n\nStep 1: Identify DGL\nIdentify the licorice product as DGL. DGL is processed licorice from which the natural glycyrrhizic acid has been removed. High doses of glycyrrhizic acid have been shown to cause high blood pressure, fluid retention, and low potassium levels.\n\nTip\nMost licorice food products sold in the United States are actually flavored with anise. Anise has not been shown to have the same health benefits as licorice.\n\nStep 2: Take chwable DGL\nTake chewable DGL to treat peptic ulcers. Take one 380 milligram tablet three times a day, about 20 to 30 minutes before a meal.\n\nTip\nDGL products are available for purchase online or in natural food stores.\n\nStep 3: Use DGL mouthwash\nUse a DGL mouthwash to treat canker sores. Mix 200 milligrans of DGL powder with 200 milliliters of warm water; swish it in your mouth for two to three minutes, spit it out, and repeat three or four times per day.\n\nStep 4: Treat ulcers with tincture\nTreat ulcers with a licorice root tincture. Take 1 teaspoon of DGL liquid root tincture three times a day; take the tincture by itself or combine it with a cup of warm water.\n\nStep 5: Apply DGL cream\nApply a thin layer of DGL cream or gel to areas of atopic dermatitis.

The name frog derives from Old English frogga, (compare Old Norse frauki, German Frosch, older Dutch spelling kikvorsch), cognate with Sanskrit plava (frog), probably deriving from Proto-Indo-European praw = \"to jump\".[1]\n\nMost frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes and the absence of a tail. Most frogs have a semi-aquatic lifestyle, but move easily on land by jumping or climbing. They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes, and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and develop in water. Adult frogs follow a carnivorous diet, mostly of arthropods, annelids and gastropods. Frogs are most noticeable by their call, which can be widely heard during the night or day, mainly in their mating season.\n\nThe distribution of frogs ranges from tropic to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species described, they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. However, populations of certain frog species are declining significantly.\n\nA distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance, caused by the convergent adaptation among so-called toads to dry environments; however, this distinction has no taxonomic basis. The only family exclusively given the common name \"toad\" is Bufonidae, but many species from other families are also called \"toads,\" and the species within the toad genus Atelopus are referred to as \"harlequin frogs\".", "title": "Frogs", "publishedDate": "2009-03-18T11:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "70ovUzO9PVM", "description": "Accident in Kampong Cham 23 Feb 2014", "title": "Accident in Kampong Cham 23 Feb 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T07:01:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "70pChzI9qq8", "description": "For more information on this home visit:\nhttp://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1637-Arbor-Ridge-Drive_Fort-Worth_TX_76112_1118990556 \n\nWonderful light filled home offers commanding staircase and a comfortable modern floor plan with its exceedingly comfortable & inviting living spaces.

Our editorial decisions are guided by the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and the story in question is in full compliance with the requirements set out by this document.\"\n\nEarlier, Roskomnadzor released a statement, quoted by Russian media, saying it had asked the BBC Russian Service editors to remove the story.\n\nIt warned that if the editors \"continue to adopt an unconstructive position then the only possibility left to Roskomnadzor, to implement Federal Law 398-F3 of 28.12.2013, will be to block the BBC Russian Service website, on which the illegal information is published\".\n\nThe law (in Russian) entitles the Russian authorities to block any information on the web which could threaten civil order and incite mass disturbances or \"extremist actions\".", "title": "BBC rebuffs Russian state complaint over Siberia march.", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T20:58:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "70xO5Qe4Sek", "description": "24 Hour Test Drive: http://helicopterground.kajabi.com/sp/26619-helicopter-ground-school-24-hour-test-drive-2014-update\n\nFull membership: http://helicopterground.kajabi.com/sp/8703-helicopter-online-ground-school\n\nWebsite http://HelicopterGround.com\n\nTranslating Tendency\n\nWhat is Translating Tendency? It is the tendency of the helicopter to drift in the direction of tail rotor thrust. This is Kenny Keller, the creator of Helicopter Online Ground School. I wanted to give you this tip because people screw this up on their check rides all the time. The 3 T's. Effective Translational Lift. Transverse Flow Effect. Translating Tendency. Now on you Helicopter Check Ride the examiner is going to ask how do we compensate for Translating Tendency? In this particular case, this is an Enstrom Helicopter. The Enstrom main rotor shaft is rigged slightly to the left to compensate for the tail rotor thrust. So depending on witch make and model of the helicopter you are flying, will determine how you answer this question. This is some insight to what we are doing inside Helicopter Online Ground School. We have lots of cool stuff going on. We are building new Helicopter Training all the time. If you enjoy this video, please gives us a like and leave comments in the box below.

Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a \"sense of humour.\"\nThe term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which stated that a mix of fluids known as humours (Greek: \u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, chymos, literally juice or sap; metaphorically, flavour) controlled human health and emotion. (This theory has since been found to be counterfactual.)[citation needed]\nA sense of humour is the ability to experience humour, although the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence, and context. For example, young children may possibly favour slapstick, such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or cartoons (e.g., Tom and Jerry). Satire may rely more on understanding the target of the humour, and thus tends to appeal to more mature audiences. Nonsatirical humour can be specifically termed \"recreational drollery.\"[1][2]", "title": "Samo Soviet - Balloon Sounds", "publishedDate": "2009-03-13T16:07:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "710O5k85Oss", "description": "New England FIber Optics Council at the MIT Center for Integrated Photonic Systems (CIPS) on the MIT campus.

This is not an attack upon Christians, so please don_t take this as offensive, it_s just a means of education and let people know what Jesus was truly sent with. Jesus is a Prophet of Islam, yet a God of Christianity. In Islam God is all Powerful, But in Christianity God was overpowered and crucified on the cross, how can the Almighty God be overpowered, these are just examples for people to think about, we are not forcing you to believe, just ponder and question. The Quran is the final testament, Muhammad is the final Messenger. Islam is the final religion, so no I dont Hate Islam. One God, One God only, He does not beget nor was he begotten, He is the GREATEST. And has no partners. (Holy Quran Ch 112)\nThe following is a video response to bball1989_s video _Why I Hate Religion, But Love Jesus || Spoken Word_. \n_And they say: the Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a Son. Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing, whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall to ruins, that ye ascribe to the Beneficent a son, when it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should chose a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave._ (Qur_an 19:88-93).\nI point out the false reasoning in the poem, and give some good reasons (there are more) to not believe his point. This is just me discussing the video, and what is wrong about the argument, and worst statements of the poem. Be sure to share this video, and thank you very much for your time!

If the Bible is truly God_s word, why are there different versions of the Bible?

Fear no more; at our practice we have built the ideal practice, in the perfect location, the Phoenix Scottsdale area, with a team of caring specialists to treat all of your dental needs with Painless Sedation. We will listen to your concerns, whether it is negative childhood dental experiences, possibly a severe gag reflex, fear of needles, fear of \"Novocain\" or even the high-pitched sound of the dental drill. Whatever the reason, if you have avoided the dentist for years, at all costs, so you walk around with a badly broken down tooth, chewing on only one side of your mouth, until another tooth breaks on the other side. Or with swollen, bleeding gums and bad breath (halitosis) until an embarrassing moment with a significant other, or worse, when a co-worker or a stranger mentions it. Now your fear of the actual dental treatment is compounded by your embarrassment over letting a dentist see how \"bad your teeth really are\" and for neglecting your oral health and possibly far of the time it will take for treatment, cost of the treatment, and so forth. Fear no more, we here at the practice of Dr. Kidess, http://www.pvsmiles.com are specialized at helping you regain your oral health. Often under sedation, all treatment can be completed in one comprehensive visit using safe, sedation options. There are options, and they can be from just providing a distraction, such as noise cancelling headphones while watching a good movie, or listening to great music, for others it comes in a mild sedative form of nitrous oxide (laughing gas). And for others it may be stronger forms of sedation, with a combination of oral conscious sedation, up to IV Sedation. \nSo don't let fear stop you from getting the healthy and gorgeous smile that you deserve, in the right hands, you should be completely relaxed and even snoozing through your next dental visit. \nWe specialize in treating out-of-towners, so why not travel to the Scottsdale Phoenix area and get in some great desert sunsets and get all your sedation dental needs addressed at one time. \nTo learn more visit our website http://www.pvsmiles.com or give us a call at 480-991-2290.", "title": "Scottsdale, AZ - The Perfect Location for Sedation Dentistry", "publishedDate": "2013-05-26T13:20:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "71IxckMOngY", "description": "Frases Famosas de Winston Churchill.

The special appearance of the human eye (i.e., white sclera contrasted with a coloured iris) implies the importance of detecting another person's face through eye contact.

Quello che molti sospettavano \u00e8 ora ufficiale: l'attentato a Berlusconi con la statuetta del Duomo era una messinscena: Tartaglia presto scagionato e riabilitato.\n\nDopo la disfatta delle amministrative a Milano e dei 4 referendum, il Prof. Alberto Zangrillo, medico personale di Berlusconi, rilascia sorprendenti dichiarazioni che riaprono il caso dell'attentato a Berlusconi: \"Sono balle!\". Questa frase emerge dall'analisi  a rovescio delle sue dichiarazioni nel Referto medico che a suo tempo aveva predisposto. \"E' una vile macchinazione di Pisapia\", sostiene Letizia Moratti. Citando Scajola, il prof Zangrillo sostiene che quella frase \u00e8 stata pronunciata da lui a sua insaputa. Nella registrazione dell'intervista, ecco la frase chiave che emerge dall'ascolto a rovescio (non c'\u00e8 trucco, basta verificare con un semplice programma di registrazione digitale. Per altri esempi vai al gruppo REVERSE SPEECH su Facebook)\n\nDopo anni di studio, ricerche e sperimentazioni nel vasto e complesso campo del cosiddetto \"Linguaggio Rovesciato\", Riccardo Misto ha sviluppato un organico sistema teorico-pratico che permette un'accurata indagine e analisi dei messaggi inconsci che la mente costantemente invia, parallelamente al normale discorso palese, sotto forma di frasi chiaramente rintracciabili nel flusso verbale ascoltato a rovescia.\nGrazie a funzionali programmi informatici che la moderna tecnologia digitale mette oggi a disposizione, e con una speciale tecnica di analisi approfondita, \u00e8 possibile isolare, decodificare e interpretare questo metalinguaggio in chiave terapeutica, al fine di scoprire in breve tempo preziose informazioni di cui la mente \u00e8 a conoscenza a livello subconscio: grazie a queste si possono quindi risolvere problematiche personali e familiari a carattere psicosomatico, andando cos\u00ec a modificare il comportamento indesiderato e sradicando alla radice abitudini fisse che limitano la completa potenzialit\u00e0 ed efficienza della persona.\nIn poche sedute \u00e8 possibile scoprire i blocchi subconsci e con un programma di destrutturazione e riprogrammazione mentale, ottenere la scomparsa di una vasta gamma di problematiche psicologiche, comportamentali, fisiche e fisiologiche originate da modelli di pensiero rigido.\n\nQuesto sistema di \"Analisi del Linguaggio Rovesciato\" \u00e8 altres\u00ec utilizzabile in altri ambiti professionali non strettamente terapeutici, quando sia necessario e conveniente avere un rapido e chiaro quadro sulla veridicit\u00e0 e completezza delle informazioni ricevute in sede di contrattazioni commerciali, transazioni legali e pratiche investigative in genere. Con il supporto di questa analisi sar\u00e0 facile verificare l'autenticit\u00e0 delle dichiarazioni ricevute e poter quindi valutare con maggior sicurezza la seriet\u00e0 e affidabilit\u00e0 della controparte con cui si sta trattando. Viene cos\u00ec risparmiato tempo prezioso e si evitano spiacevoli sorprese.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaggiori info su \n\nhttp://lnx.nadayoga.it/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=151\n\nISCRIVITI AL GRUPPO FACEBOOK: LINGUAGGIO ROVESCIATO", "title": "LINGUAGGIO ROVESCIATO: SVELATO IL FALSO ATTENTATO A BERLUSCONI", "publishedDate": "2011-06-14T20:44:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "71QJBEWwvAM", "description": "Gibson Les Paul Custom + Vox Ac 30 + Lem Echo BABY.\nEl sonido es muy malo porque est\u00e1 grabado con el m\u00f3vil.", "title": "Lem echo tape BABY", "publishedDate": "2011-03-31T11:39:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "71QOTnjTs_E", "description": "Hicham et mehdi  cover", "title": "Daba Tjibek _  \u062f\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u062a\u062c\u064a\u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0645", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T11:44:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "71QUgN0w-PE", "description": "http://www.myspace.com/blastkhorps\ncheck the mp3's on myspace\n\nEvery sound you hear on this beat is all from the mouth (beatbox)\nif you wana colab on a beat messege me on facebook or myspace\nany mc's wana colab or beatboxers... anyone messege me", "title": "Simply Symon (Blastkhorps) - benga and coki - night - all mouth beatbox", "publishedDate": "2008-12-03T02:38:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "71RE268ZR0E", "description": "Audience Feedback from the research week at Bude, Cornwall.", "title": "Countryboy's Struggle: Audience Feedback", "publishedDate": "2011-06-15T16:59:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "71Rd-yGzvx4", "description": "Watch Ravindra Jadeja Slams A Half Century in New Zealand Vs India 4th ODI.

It is an ancient Hindu religious festival which has become popular with non Hindus in many parts of South Asia, as well as people of other communities.\n\nHoli celebrations start with a Holika bonfire on the night before Holi where people gather, sing and dance. The next morning is free for all carnival of colours, where everyone plays, chases and colours each other with dry powder and coloured water, with some carrying water guns and coloured water filled balloons for their water fight.\n\nHoli is celebrated at the approach of vernal equinox, on the Phalguna Purnima. The festival date varies every year, per the Hindu calendar, and typically comes in March, sometimes February in the Gregorian Calendar. The festival signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair ruptured relationships.\n\nIn Gujarat Holi is two day festival. On the evening of the first day people lit the bonfire. People offer raw coconut, corn to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or \"Dhuleti\", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other.\n\nThe Holi celebration has its celebrative origins in Gujarat, particularly with dance, food, music, and coloured powder to offer a spring parallel of Navratri, Gujarat's Hindu festival celebrated in the fall. Falling in the Hindu month of Phalguna, Holi marks the agricultural season of the Rabi crop.\n\nHere you can download nice, HD, High quality, High resolution, Widescreen, 1080p and 720p, festival of indian, happy holi wallpapers 2014 free download.\n\nDownload happy holi nice wallpapers, holi photos, happy holi images, dhuleti photos, download happy holi cover pictures 2014, happy holi wishes and celebration wallpapers or photos or images, e cards festival photos, gretting festival wallpapers, download indian festival happy holi images, dhuleti colour photos download, people celebrate dhuleti holi fesival photos, Holi the festival of colours photos download, 17 march 2014 holi festival celebrate indian people, wishes and e-cards photos holi festival, hindu festival wallpapers, holika dahan photos or wallpapers or images, Hiranyakashipu HD wallpapers photos, Phagwah wallpapers and images, Dolajatra images download, Dol jatra pictures, Basantotsav wallpapers download, holika dahan celebration in rajasthan, holiday into holi and dhuleti, holi festival in gujarat photos, folk dance rajasthan images download, Different types of dance style in rajasthan holi festival wallpapers.

Reciting affirmations is a holistic approach to \"tricking\" the brain into \"believing\" whatever it is that you are trying to attain or obtain. Remember the old phrase, \"I think I can, I think I can\"?

In the first part, our high shear homogenizer in RB vacuum emulsifier mixer runs with water inside the mixer tank. You can see from the video that it pumps water at a great speed with high pressure. You can see more information here in our website: http://www.ginhong.com/products/homogenizer/high-shear-mixer/.\n\nIn the second part, the content inside the mixer tank was changed. It's now wheat batter instead of water. Wheat batter is a kind of food which is mainly made of water and flour. It's very very sticky as you can see it from the video.\n\nOur high shear homogenizer performed poorly when it came to wheat batter. The motor was snarling deeply and noisely. The batter was dripping down from the outlet port of the homogenizer. Obviously it's not powerful enough to pump wheat batter.\n\nThese two short videos were taken by one of our customers in food industry. They bought a 500L RB series of vacuum emulsifier mixer without hydraulics from us. The mixer was made of a set of contra rotating agitator and scraper with inline high shear homogenizer.\n\nAs he didn't tell us that batter is so viscous that we're not prepared to tailor make their system. When they received the machine and tested in their factory, the problem came. We finally got a solution to this problem.\n\nThe reason that our high shear homogenizer can't mix wheat batter is because of the mixer's relatively poor pumping function. If we add a professional transfer pump before the homogenizer to feed the batter to the homogenizer, it may work.\n\nWe then sent customer a rotary lobe pump with similar flow rate as high shear homogenizer. Customer connected it between mixer tank and homogenizer and then tested it with wheat batter again. It now proved to be a successful system.\n\nWe learned a lesson from this experience. The more information customers provide us, the more accurate and suitable system we design for them. If you make wheat batter in food industry and are looking for vacuum mixer with high shear homogenizer, please feel free to contact us. It's our pleasure to receive your inquires.\n\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/lukewhb\nBlogspot: http://lukewhb.blogspot.com/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukewhb\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lukewhb\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lukewhb\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/lukewhb/", "title": "High shear homogenizer can't mix wheat batter by itself", "publishedDate": "2014-04-30T06:25:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "72QZLU311BY", "description": "From their album 'Nights Are Forever'.

Spink\nScreenwriter: \nFilm Description: It's not unusual to see two women fighting over the same man in a movie, only this time it's his mother and his fianc\u00e9e vying for his attention in this broad comedy. While Charlotte Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez), known to her friends as Charlie, has never had much luck in her love life, one day her ship arrives in a big way when she meets Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan), a doctor who is charming, handsome, and wealthy. Kevin also has a famous mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), who has enjoyed a long and successful career as a news broadcaster. When Kevin and Charlie fall head over heels for one another, he opts to propose marriage to her as he's introducing Charlie to Viola over lunch. However, as far as Viola is concerned, this could not come at a worse time -- Viola has just been fired from the anchor desk, and regards her son as the only anchor left in her life. Not willing to share Kevin with anyone, Viola sets out to sabotage his relationship with Charlie in any way she can, often with the wary assistance of her secretary Ruby (Wanda Sykes). But once Charlie gets wind of Viola's schemes, she decides two can play this game. Monster-in-Law marked Jane Fonda's return to the screen after a long leave of absence; it was her first film after co-starring with Robert De Niro in 1990's Stanley & Iris.\n\nmonster-in-law,\"monster-in-law trailer\",\"monster-in-law part 1\",\"monster-in-law 2005 trailer\",\"jane fonda\",\"jennifer lopez\",\"wanda sykes\",\"michael vartan\",\"robert luketic\",\"champagne videos\",\"photo album videos\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"chris bender\",\"paula weinstein\",\"toby emmerich\",\"richard brener\",\"jc spink\",\"magnus kim\",\"rivalry videos\",\"beach videos\",\"house videos\",ruby,\"charlotte charlie cantilini\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++293952,/m/01_xsz,/m/0h1mt,/m/043zg,/m/02wr2r", "title": "Monster-in-Law Official Trailer #1 - (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T11:42:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "72mHbcDpazo", "description": "Watch more Belly Dancing 101 videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/460665-How-to-Isolate-Upper-Abs-Belly-Dancing\n\nLet belly dancer Irina Akulenko teach you how to do the belly dance move known as the traveling twist in this Howcast video.\n\n\nNow let's try the travelling hip twist. Keeping the knees bent, just lift, the lower abs engaged, tailbone down. We're going to twist front to back, keeping the movement horizontal to the floor. So we're just twisting the hips. Now we're going to just take a step with the right foot, crossing the left behind. And again right, and crossing behind, right, crossing behind, and make sure you are taking very small steps keeping the movement right underneath your hip bone. We're going to switch the footwork. We're going to start with the left, crossing the right behind, and left, right behind. And again, keeping it really small. The smaller the movements are, the easier the hip work will be. Now, we're going to combine the two movements together. We're going to bring the hip back. We're going to release the right foot, so this is the right side that's active right now. We're going to step into the right leg and push the right hip forward into a twist. Then we're going to bring the left foot behind, bringing the hip back. And step forward, cross back. And forward, cross back. And forward, cross back. We can switch the movement, as well, so starting with the left foot, we're going to bring the left hip back, lifting the left foot off the floor, stepping onto it, pushing the left hip forward, and bring it back. Step forward and back. And we're focusing on one hip at a time where the other hip is obviously working. So, let's try that a little bit faster, and try it with music. And forward and back. And left, cross, left, cross, left. And this movement is a little bit easier if you're travelling faster, if you come up on your toes. So, starting with the right hip, and forward.  And remember to keep the knees slightly bent no matter what. Chest is lifted. And faster. And that's how you travel with a hip twist.", "title": "How to Do a Traveling Twist | Belly Dancing", "publishedDate": "2011-05-20T20:24:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "72mM0iBjR6w", "description": ".........................::Rawstyle Nation::.........................\n\nOnly the best Rawstyle tracks will be supported.\n\nArtist:Warface & Predator\n\nYoutube:https://www.youtube.com/user/WarfaceO...\nSoundcloud:https://soundcloud.com/warfaceofficial\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/WarfaceOffic...\n\nIf you like the track please Subscribe & Like for more!!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you're the owner of this track.

The spectrum of nucleotide base lesions includes: spontaneous or enzyme-induced deamination, oxidation or alkylation. \nThe starrings of the BER pathway are the glycosylases enzymes. They are the DNA-damage sensors and have evolved to selectively detect different kinds of DNA insults. An important trait of the glycosylases consists in their substrate redundance, as demonstrated by mouse models lacking one glycosylase, wich triggers mild consecuences. The glycosylases can be classified as monofunctional, when, only posses the N-glycosylase function, so exclusively removes the damaged nitrogenated  base of the nucleotide. When additionally has an AP-lyase activity to remove the deoxyribophosphate (dRP), generating an abasic (AP) site, they are considered as bifunctional glycosylases.\n\nMONOFUNCTIONAL DNA Glycosylases: \n- MPG\n- UNG-1\n- UNG2\n- SMUG\n- MBD4\n- TDG\n- MYH\n\nBIFUNCTIONAL DNA Glycosylases:\n- OGG1\n- NTH\n- NEIL-1 \n- NEIL-2\n\nMain steps of BER short pathway\n1- A depurinized, oxydized or alkylated nucleotide base is generated spontaneously or by metabolic-generated reactive oxygen species..\n2- A DNA glysosylase specifically detects the damaged nitrogenated base of the nucleotide and removes it.\n3- The XRCC1 protein, brings APE1 nuclease into the damage site, where will use its AP-lyase activity for cleaving the 5' extrem of the phosphodiester bond. generating an abasic (AP) site.\n4- DNA polymerase \u03b2 will  cleave the 3' extrem of the phosphodiester bond, generating an abasic (AP) site. Then, fills the abasic gap by introducing a complementary nucleotide..\n5- Ligase III, acompanied by the scaffolding protein XRCC1, seals the gap.\n\nBibliography:\nGougang Xu, et al.(2008).
