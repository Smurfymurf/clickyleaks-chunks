The film\u2019s gripping events unfold on an isolated farm caught in the chaos of Sherman\u2019s March to the Sea.

Though the war is nearly over, they have never been more vulnerable.  Threats loom from every direction, from outlaws and renegades to the natural world. Then suddenly, the women are confronted by their greatest fear of all:  an attack from a marauding pair of break-away Union soldiers (Sam Worthington of Avatar, Kyle Soller of Anna Karenina).

Il d\u00e9bute en 1912 \u00e0 Graz, o\u00f9 il chante jusqu'en 1916. De 1916 \u00e0 1918, il chante \u00e0 Prague, de 1918 \u00e0 1923 \u00e0 Cologne, de 1923 \u00e0 1931 \u00e0 Berlin, ainsi que de 1924 \u00e0 1933 \u00e0 Londres et de 1924 \u00e0 1943 au Metropolitan Opera. Entre 1925 et 1933, il chante au Festival de Bayreuth, o\u00f9 il tient les r\u00f4les de Wotan (La Walkyrie), du Voyageur (Siegfried), de Hans Sachs (Les Ma\u00eetres Chanteurs de Nuremberg) et du Hollandais (Le Vaisseau fant\u00f4me). Il est alors consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le plus grand interpr\u00e8te wagn\u00e9rien de son temps et comme le pivot artistique du festival.\nAvec l'arriv\u00e9e au pouvoir des Nazis en 1933, Friedrich Schorr, de confession juive, devient du jour au lendemain persona non grata sur les lieux de ses plus grands triomphes et s'exile aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Naturalis\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain, il chanta au Metropolitan Opera jusqu'en 1943, puis, sa puissance vocale d\u00e9clinant, s'adonne \u00e0 la mise en sc\u00e8ne et aux r\u00e9citals de concert.\nDes enregistrements sur le vif r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1930, alors que Schorr commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 s'essouffler, n'en t\u00e9moignent pas moins d'une technique tr\u00e8s s\u00fbre, d'une diction parfaitement claire et tr\u00e8s expressive, et d'un ind\u00e9niable charisme.\n\u00c0 New York, Schorr partage fr\u00e9quemment la sc\u00e8ne avec sa compagne d'exil Lotte Lehmann, mais aussi avec Lauritz Melchior, Frida Leider, puis Kirsten Flagstad et Helen Traubel - un ensemble \u00e0 ce jour in\u00e9gal\u00e9.\n\nFriedrich Schorr (September 2, 1888 \u2013 August 14, 1953), was a renowned Austrian-Hungarian bass-baritone opera singer of Jewish origin. He later became a naturalized American.\nSchorr is recognized as the greatest Wagnerian bass-baritone of his generation, arguably of the entire 20th century, and was particularly famous for his profound portrayals of Wotan in Der Ring des Nibelungen and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. He was celebrated, too, for his appearances as Don Pizarro in Beethoven's Fidelio.\nHis voice was powerful, steady, and rich-toned, with a beautiful mezza voce. He placed a special and an emphasis on maintaining a smooth, legato line in his singing, with no trace of Sprechgesang. Towards the end of Schorr's career, his extreme top notes became somewhat 'wooden', however, as the result of many years of strenuous usage.\nThe son of a cantor (hazzan) Mayer Schorr, who reportedly had a fine voice himself, Schorr was born in Oradea [Nagyvarad at the time]. He studied in Brno and Vienna with Adolf Robinson. He made his stage debut in Graz, singing there in 1912-1916. Afterwards he worked in Prague (1916\u20131918), Cologne (1918\u20131923), Berlin (State Opera Unter den Linden, 1923\u20131931). He also made acclaimed appearances in London at Covent Garden (1924\u20131931), at New York's Metropolitan Opera (1924\u20131943) and the Bayreuth Festival (1925\u20131933).\n\nSchorr emigrated to the United States in 1931. He lived in New York City and performed regularly at the 'Met' until 1943. Some of the outstanding Wagnerian singers that he appeared with during his career included Frida Leider, Lotte Lehmann, Elisabeth Rethberg, Lauritz Melchior, Kirsten Flagstad, and Helen Traubel. After his retirement from performance he worked as a director and gave concerts. He also taught singing privately. One of his students was mezzo-soprano Nell Tangeman. He died in Farmington, New York.\nSource: Wikipedia", "title": "Friedrich Schorr  Tannhauser   Als du in k\u00fchnensang   Electrola EW 87 enregistr\u00e9 en 1929", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T11:40:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-h0iBPd_wbQ", "description": "structure of corundum", "title": "MDMW-Corundum&Sapphire01", "publishedDate": "2009-06-25T09:39:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-h10Nn84Sgs", "description": "See video for details....Let us know what you think of this idea.

Also starring Oscar nominee** Edward Norton, The Score wowed critics and audiences alike. When expert safecracker Nick Wells (De Niro) decides it might be time to settle down with his girlfriend Diane (Oscar nominee*** Angela Bassett) and stick to his legitimate business, running a jazz nightclub in Montreal, his friend and partner Max (Brando) has other plans.  Heavily in debt to a crime boss, Max needs Nick to pull one last heist:  help novice thief Jack Teller (Norton) steal a scepter worth $30 million from the House of Customs.  Tempted by the $6 million payday, Nick reluctantly agrees to do the job.  But what starts out as a safe bet turns into a high risk gamble when a clash of egos threatens to bring them all down. Featuring performances by jazz greats Cassandra Wilson and Mose Allison, The Score is one of the smartest, most entertaining crime capers ever filmed, with surprises at every turn.*De Niro: 1974 Best Supporting Actor, The Godfather Part II, 1980 Best Actor, Raging Bull, Brando: 1954 Best Actor, On the Waterfront**1996 Best Supporting Actor nominee: Primal Fear, 1998 Best Actor nominee, American History X***1993 Best Actress nominee, What's Love Got To Do With It?", "title": "The Score - Trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-05-23T16:50:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-h5gzcqjMKY", "description": "", "title": "conversion of metric units cubic decimeter to cubic centimeter 2", "publishedDate": "2013-02-26T05:44:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-h5lnQV2Ulg", "description": "Narra\u00e7\u00e3o em Portugu\u00eas de Portugal", "title": "Krait Comum, 7\u00ba dos 12 animais mais perigosos da \u00cdndia", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T15:55:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-h6Qvq2SbiE", "description": "More Uxor demo.

Kerontokan Rambut Yang Berlebihan Berawal Dari Akar Rambut Yang Kering Dan Telah Mati Yang Kebanyakan Penyebabnya Antara Lain: Infeksi Kulit Kepala Serta Akar Rambut, Kurangnya Gizi, Kurang Darah, Lemahnya Akar Rambut, Ketombe, Stress. Maka kesehatan rambut harus terjaga bahkan harus menjaga dari pangkalnya agar rambut tidak rusak dan tumbuh dengan cepat dan lebat.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "War Sonnets IV The Dead by Rupert Brooke", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:58:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-hXmw4UnP7I", "description": "", "title": "Smallz - Moneymaker", "publishedDate": "2010-09-24T17:47:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-hXtHrXvs_E", "description": "Sequestration is on everyones mind as massive government budget cuts are set to go into effect tomorrow.\nWith a focus on cuts in defense and social programs - what about the housing market?\n According to US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan  sequestration could be \"deeply destructive\" to all aspects of the\nhousing market, From programs for the homeless to reconstruction\nafter Superstorm Sandy.

In his place was a glum character, whose gloomy demeanor matched the lack of legislative motion he was discussing -- and the many obstacles (from Republicans to Russians) he complained were in his way.\n\nAfter listening to a recitation of his political predicament, the president said, \"If you put it that way, maybe I should just pack up and go home.\" It was a joke, of course, but no one laughed and, judging from his attitude, it almost seemed as though he wished he could.\n\nOnly when asked about Jason Collins did the president become animated and eager to respond. Obama praised the NBA center for his decision to come out of the closet about his sexual orientation and said that the American people should be proud of the growing acceptance of gays and lesbians.\n\nIn terms of energy and forward lean, Tuesday morning's performance was about as static as the Obama presidency has ever been.\n\nHis administration is not the first to fall into a Slough of Despond early in the second term. It's all but inevitable. Still, the session was notable primarily for the complexity and intractability of the issues Obama is now facing.\n\nSyria is an unholy mess, a proud and ancient country being ground to pieces in a bloody conflict between a ruthless dictator and rebels whose ideas may well be no more tolerant or democratic.\n\nOn the Boston bombings, it is now clear that somebody dropped the ball on the Tsarnaevs, and the only question is who. It might well have been the Russians, which means that Obama has to get closer to Vladimir Putin than he wants. It also means that U.S. and Russian security officials must overcome decades of Cold War distrust. www.sinopmasaj.com", "title": "Obama: 'Maybe I Should Just Pack Up And Go Home' www.sinopmasaj.com", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T07:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-htJ94_2r0g", "description": "A cacca di cicalotti (tricholoma portentosum) con Pap\u00e0 sulle alture di Ponte di Nava!

The baby Langur is seen frolicking around its mother, amusing as they always are.\n\nGray langurs are primarily herbivores. However, unlike some other colobines they do not depend on leaves and leaf buds of herbs, but will as eat also coniferous needles and cones, fruits and fruit buds, evergreen petioles, shoots and roots, seeds, grass, bamboo, fern rhizomes, mosses, and lichens. Leaves of trees and shrubs rank at the top of preferred food, followed by herbs and grasses. Non-plant material consumed include spider webs, termite mounds and insect larvae. They forage on agricultural crops and other human foods, and even accept handouts. Although they occasionally drink, langurs get most of their water from the moisture in their food.\n\nThe entire distribution of all gray langur species stretches from the Himalayas in the north to Sri Lanka in the south and Bangladesh in the east to Pakistan in the west. They possibly occur in Afghanistan.\n\nGray langurs can adapt to a variety of habitats. They inhabit arid habitats like deserts, tropical habitats like tropical rainforests and tempeature habitats like coniferous forests, deciduous habitats and mountains habitats. They live at altitudes up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft), even during snowfall. They can adapt well to human settlements, and are found in villages, towns and areas with housing or agriculture. They live in densely populated cities like Jodhpur, which has a population numbering up to a million.\n\nIn Uttarakhand, Leopards are found in areas which are abundant in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, ghoral (goat-antelopes), Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants can be seen in herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), Brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) are found in the rivers. Butterflies and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), Jungle Babbler, Tawny-bellied Babbler, Great Slaty Woodpecker, Red-breasted Parakeet, Orange-breasted Green Pigeon and Chestnut-winged Cuckoo.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Such was the case of the Hlubi and the Ngwane. Bereft of all social order, these refugees took to looting and pillaging wherever they went. They reduced the landscape in the Natal and much of the Orange Free State into a wasteland. This period of change became known as the Mfecane, which is said to derive originally from a Zulu word meaning \"crushing\". For the past ten years the word and ideas behind it have aroused much debate and argument. \n\nMany South African historians now believe that Europeans, and slave traders in particular, played a much larger part in upheaval in the region in the first quarter of the 19th century than was previously thought, and that too much emphasis has been put on Shaka's impact.\"\n\nWilliam Pitt, The Younger. 1759-1806.\n\n352.

April 2, 1792.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=_SoQAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA452&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n\n\"You have carried on a trade to that quarter of the globe from this civilized and enlightened country but such a trade, that, instead of diffusing either knowledge or wealth, it has been the check to every laudable pursuit. Instead of any fair interchange of commodities; instead of conveying to them, from this highly favored land, any means of improvement; you carry with you that noxious plant by which everything is withered and blasted; under whose shade nothing that is useful or profitable to Africa will ever flourish or take root. Long as that continent has been known to navigators, the extreme line and boundaries of its coasts is all with which Europe is yet become acquainted; while other countries in the same parallel of latitude, through a happier system of intercourse, have reaped the blessings of a mutually beneficial commerce. But as to the whole interior of that continent you are, by your own principles of commerce, as yet entirely shut out: Africa is known to you only in its skirts. Yet here you are able to infuse a poison that spreads its contagious effects from one end of it to the other, which penetrates to its very center, corrupting every part to which it reaches. You there subvert the whole order of nature; you aggravate every natural barbarity, and furnish to every man living on that continent motives for committing, under the name and pretext of commerce, acts of perpetual violence and perfidy\"\n\nPerey Noble\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=pSMbAAAAYAAJ&dq=perry%20noble&pg=PA184#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n\n\"During our century Muslim or pagan powers arose in Ashanti, Dahome, Kazembe, Lunda, Muata=Yanvo, Sahara, Senegambia, Sudan, Tabililand, Uganda, Upper Zambezia, Zanguebar and Zululand. These aided the development of Africa, influenced its relations with Europe and participated in preparing it for missions. Of the thirteen native states only three were not Negro powers, only four were not pagan. These (omitting the Mahdists) were the Arabs of Senusi and from Zanzibar and the Fulah of Senegambia and West Sudan. The Fulah and the Zanzibari have become quite Nigritic, and the ruling native race of Central and East Sudan belongs to the Negro. The black man instead of the Arab and the Berber has enabled Europe, seconded by America, to open Africa*....\n\nFootnote:\n\n\u2022Speke, 1855, said: \"The freed Negro contributed more than any one else to open Africa '. It is a source of regret to the present writer that the Procrustean lack of space prevents him from doing justice to the brawn and faithfulness of the Africans who in exploring and other enterprises have enabled brave and brainy white men to develop Africa. He hopes that some American Negro will work out this thesis.\n\nZanguebar until 1884 remained a self=governing sultanate, its sovereign ruling in 1861 from Mukhdisho to Cape Delgado and his influence extending to Lake Tanganika, five hundred miles west.

It accepts 30mm bore tooling and in addition there are two collets, 8mm and 1/2\", supplied with the machine so that, when used on its highest speed, it can utilise router cutters with a diameter of 35mm or greater (smaller cutters simply would not have a high enough peripheral speed). The machine has one fully adjustable fence, micro adjustment on the outfeed fence and a 100mm dust extraction outlet at the rear. Height adjustment of the spindle is made with a generous handle on the front of the machine and tooling changes can be speeded up with the aid of the spindle lock. For curved work the moulder is supplied with a ring fence with its own integral 100mm dust outlet. On the bed of the table is a T slotted groove in which the mitre guide slides and there is an additional tenoning guide (order number 100415) available for end grain work. The mounting holes for the power feed are tapped into the base, thereby removing the need to drill holes in the table.

Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.\"\n\n 6 When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry. 7 I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, \"You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!\" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them 8 and said: \"As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!\" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.\n\n 9 So I continued, \"What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies? 10 I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop! 11 Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them\u2014the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil.\"\n\n 12 \"We will give it back,\" they said. \"And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.\" \n      Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. 13 I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, \"In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!\" \n      At this the whole assembly said, \"Amen,\" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.\n\n 14 Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year\u2014twelve years\u2014neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. 15 But the earlier governors\u2014those preceding me\u2014placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels [a] of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that. 16 Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we [b] did not acquire any land.\n\n 17 Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations. 18 Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.\n\n 19 Remember me with favor, O my God, for all I have done for these people.", "title": "Nehemiah 5 (with text - press on more info.)", "publishedDate": "2010-06-01T10:39:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-iQRaZje0RA", "description": "Here's a video we made with all our friends! \"TRY IT OUT (NEON MIX)\" sets a perfect mood for exercising, hunting T-Rexs, swimming in volcanos, playing with catbug, playing video games, or just hanging out with your parents on a cool summer's night.

To overcome this, a common feature is concealed placement. There are some species of Lycaenid butterflies who are protected in their pupal stage by ants. Another means of defense by pupae of other species is the capability of making sounds or vibrations to scare potential predators. A few species use chemical defenses including toxic secretions. The pupae of social hymenopterans are protected by adult members of the hive. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysalis#Chrysalis \n\n\nPsalm 59:8-9 \"But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defense.\"\n\n Most of the world's 17,000 species of butterflies are delicate, colorful creatures. Geneticists have been studying the various patterns found on their wings, hoping to relate their findings to evolution. But so far, all their findings have failed to support evolution, and some even contradict evolution.\n\nButterfly wings are covered with small scales. Some butterflies have scales containing molecular structures that look like tiny Christmas trees; these structures bend the light to create those iridescent colors. Other butterflies have scales containing pigment that produce the insects' various colors and patterns. But color has another function. Clouded Sulfur butterflies are found at various altitudes in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Females of this species are generally darker than the males. In fact, the females tend to become darker in color as the altitude of their habitat rises. This has survival value because darker colors absorb more heat from the sun in the cooler, higher altitudes, enabling the normal rate of metabolism to be retained. However, the male butterflies prefer the lighter-colored females. This means that the advantage of having a darker color at higher altitudes would not be passed on to another generation. This is simply an example of rapid adaptation and is of no value to the theory of evolution. \n\nAs Scripture says, the foolishness of God is greater than man's wisdom -- in this case, evolution.\n\nPrayer: \nFather, I thank You for Your wisdom. Grant me understanding. Amen.

Of those heroes, none were more legendary than Shovel Knight and Shield Knight. The two traveled and battled together across the land until their journey took them to The Tower of Fate.\n\nIt was in that dreaded tower that the duo fell under the power of a cursed amulet and blacked out. When Shovel Knight finally awoke the Tower had been sealed and Shield Knight had vanished leaving nothing behind but her helmet.\n\nOvercome with grief, Shovel Knight gave up adventuring and retired to a simple life. During his absence, a dark power arose, The Enchantress. She quickly assembled a powerful army of knights known as The Order With No Quarter that took over the land. On top of this The Tower of Fate has mysteriously become unsealed. With the small hope that he may rescue Shield Knight (and also put this Enchantress and her knights down along the way), Shovel Knight picks up his weapon for one more adventure.\n\nHave fun!\n\n---------\nThe Daily Byte: http://bit.ly/1qhR5bD\nLore! http://bit.ly/nNfsws\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\n---------\nJOIN POLARIS: http://bit.ly/17MTzDW\nPOLARISGO: http://bit.ly/1ec7Hu6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4\nMusic courtesy of Epidemic Sound and Audio Micro\n\n---------\nThanks for watching Lore!", "title": "LORE - Shovel Knight Lore in a minute!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T22:40:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ihs-vT9T3Q", "description": "Join Bee Gees on Facebook http://facebook.com/beegees & Twitter http://twitter.com/beegeesofficial\n\nNIGHT FEVER\nListen to the ground, there is movement all around\nThere is something going down and I can feel it\nOn the waves of the air, there is dancing out there\nIf it's something we can share, we can steal it\n\nAnd that sweet city woman, she moves through the light\nControlling my mind and my soul\nWhen you reach out for me yeah, and the feeling is bright\n\nThen I get night fever, night fever, we know how to do it\nGimme that night fever, night fever, we know how to show it\n\nHere I am, praying for this moment to last\nLiving on the music so fine\nBorne on the wind, making it mine\n\nNight fever, night fever, we know how to do it\nGimme that night fever, night fever, we know how to show it\n\nIn the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it\nGimme just enough to take us to the morning\nI got fire in my mind, I got higher in my walking\nAnd I'm glowing in the dark, I give you warning\n\nAnd that sweet city woman, she moves through the light\nControlling my mind and my soul\nWhen you reach out for me yeah, and the feeling is bright\n\nThen I get night fever, night fever, we know how to do it\nGimme that night fever, night fever, we know how to show it\n\nHere I am, praying for this moment to last\nLiving on the music so fine\nBorne on the wind, making it mine\n\nNight fever, night fever, we know how to do it\nGimme that night fever, night fever, we know how to show it\n\n\nFrom the album 'THE ULTIMATE BEE GEES'\n\nBUY THE DELUXE DOUBLE CD & DVD SET\nAmazon USA http://amzn.to/1brkEjR\nAmazon Canada http://amzn.to/13m2yuv\nAmazon UK http://amzn.to/1aT2W9B\nAmazon France http://amzn.to/1auhjNU\nAmazon Germany http://amzn.to/12yro7t\nAmazon Italy http://amzn.to/12XkhoT\nAmazon Spain http://amzn.to/12NLidu\nAmazon Japan http://amzn.to/194AqQW\n \nBUY THE DOUBLE CD  \nAmazon USA http://amzn.to/1brikth\nAmazon Canada http://amzn.to/13m1yqh\nAmazon UK http://amzn.to/11ZpOAr\nAmazon France http://amzn.to/194C3hv\nAmazon Germany http://amzn.to/13zPNZf\nAmazon Italy http://amzn.to/13Qm59C\nAmazon Spain http://amzn.to/12JOv2f\nAmazon Japan http://amzn.to/194AqQW\n\nDOWNLOAD THE ALBUM\niTunes https://itunes.apple.com/album/the-ultimate-bee-gees/id336671732\nAmazon USA http://amzn.to/15oILcH\nAmazon UK http://amzn.to/17ngCEb\nAmazon France http://amzn.to/15K92lE\nAmazon Italy http://amzn.to/18pBX4E\nAmazon Germany http://amzn.to/18mu506\nAmazon Spain http://amzn.to/12XiWOL\nAmazon Japan http://amzn.to/13zLJrN\n\nLISTEN ONLINE \nDeezer http://www.deezer.com/en/album/422914\nGrooveshark http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/The+Ultimate+Bee+Gees/4657434\nLast.FM http://www.last.fm/music/Bee+Gees/The+Ultimate+Bee+Gees\nMySpace https://myspace.com/beegees/music/album/the-ultimate-bee-gees-14023661\nRdio http://www.rdio.com/artist/Bee_Gees/album/The_Ultimate_Bee_Gees/\nRhapsody http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/bee-gees/album/the-ultimate-bee-gees\nSlacker http://slacker.com/r/lLHTB\nSpotify http://open.spotify.com/album/3JXTUy5Ccdpe79HUgUiMF9\n\n\u00a9 & \u2117 Barry Gibb, The Estate of Robin Gibb and The Estate of Maurice Gibb, under exclusive license to Warner Strategic Marketing Inc., a Warner Music Group Company", "title": "Bee Gees - Night Fever (1977)", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T01:25:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-iiB71sglMo", "description": "Jan Mudry spielt von seiner Solo CD \" Premiera \" den Titel Drietomsky Suhaj. \nJ\u00e1n M\u00fadry ist bei der Milit\u00e4rmusik Bratislava als Tenorist fix angestellt.

L'anthurium \u00e8 una pianta di origine tropicale, di facile coltivazione.\nTeme il freddo, quindi si coltiva in appartamento, in vaso.\nNecessita di un substrato ricco e sciolto, che lasci scorrere via la gran parte dell'acqua delle annaffiature, ma che rimanga fresco e leggermente umido, per simulare il clima tropicale.\nSi utilizza in genere un miscuglio composto da terriccio universale, torba e una piccola quantit\u00e0 di corteccia sminuzzata.\nGli anthurium si coltivano in luogo luminoso, ma lontano dai raggi diretti del sole, che potrebbero causare l'ingiallimento del fogliame; invece una posizione eccessivamente ombreggiata e buia porta ad una fioritura scarsa o del tutto assente.\nLe annaffiature devono essere molto regolari, da fornire ogni volta che il terreno \u00e8 asciutto, evitando di lasciare acqua nel sottovaso per periodi di tempo prolungati; ricordiamo di aumentare la frequenza delle annaffiature durante i periodi pi\u00f9 caldi dell'anno e di diminuirle durante l'inverno.\nDurante tutto l'arco dell'anno agli anthurium giova venire vaporizzati con acqua demineralizzata, per mantenere alto il tasso di umidit\u00e0 ambientale.\nPeriodicamente controlliamo la pianta e rimuoviamo alla base i fiori appassiti ed il fogliame rovinato, utilizzando delle forbici con affilate e pulite.\nCome accade per molte altre piane da fogliame anche gli anthurium tendono ad immagazzinare sulla pagina superiore delle foglie la polvere presente in appartamento; ogni 3-4 mesi ripuliamo il fogliame con delicatezza, utilizzando un panno in microfibra leggermente umido, in questo modo rimuoveremo anche eventuali parassiti.\n\n\n\nNel canale video http://www.youtube.com/user/GIARDINAGGIOpuntoIT moltissime guide sulla coltivazione delle tue piante e consigli sulla loro cura.\nIscriviti al nostro canale per rimanere sempre aggiornato http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GIARDINAGGIOpuntoIT\n \nSeguici su:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Giardinaggioit/133180016703498\nGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+giardinaggio/posts\n \nIl nostro sito:\nGiardinaggio.it: http://www.giardinaggio.it/\nForum di Giardinaggio.it http://forum.giardinaggio.it/", "title": "la coltivazione dell'anthurium", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T07:00:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-imFslMIN1g", "description": "Improper fractions to mixed numbers, step by step, example.

It has been used in the Vietnam War by the United States Army, and in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm by the United States Army, and the British Army.\n\nThe gun system has been retired from US Army service; howitzers above 155 mm caliber are no longer effective as technology has closed the range and firepower gap, and heavier weapon systems require more resources to operate. Gun barrels from retired M110s were initially used as the outer casing in the manufacture of the GBU-28 bunker buster bomb.", "title": "M110A2 8-inch SP Howitzer", "publishedDate": "2008-08-27T23:47:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-inRWIcd0Is", "description": "This chromatin remodeling tutorial explains the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to find out the exact structure of a nucleosome complex in eukaryotes.\nFor more information, log on to-\nhttp://shomusbiology.weebly.com/\nDownload the study materials here-\nhttp://shomusbiology.weebly.com/bio-materials.html PPT source- Dr. Anindita Banerjee, Department of Microbiology, St. Xavier's college", "title": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T04:55:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ip6Ah_vSUw", "description": "Subscribe to Discovery! | http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=discoverynetworks\n\nA dying man offers up his body for a unique experiment. | For more Curiosity, visit http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/#mkcpgn=ytdsc1", "title": "The Art of Mummification | Curiosity", "publishedDate": "2012-10-29T17:59:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ipIf102tuE", "description": "Either a sick as fire serpent or a shitty $5 deag", "title": "CS:GO | Fire Serpent Trade-Up", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T09:17:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ipMo7sVNJo", "description": "Residual Income Opportunities\nhttp://theonlinementoringcenter.com\n\nMeet Sam he runs an online business but he is unhappy.\n\nHe is having a lot of trouble with his marketing.\n\nWhy is he struggling?\n\n1. online marketing failed\n2.

Our technicians are certified, licensed experts who will treat your home with care and you like family. Ask about any specials that we may offer when setting your appointment.\n\nPeople living with children and pets in their houses are quite aware of carpet odors and stains. These things may ruin the appearance or the smell of the house, so it's very crucial to tackle them as they arise. Remember if the stain is permitted to sit for long, it will be quite difficult to remove and thus become a lasting fixture in the house. However, there are some simple but very effective methods of dealing with odors and stains to keep the home looking and smelling its best.\n \nThe first step to remove an odor is to detect its type. In identifying the type of odor, you will be in a good position to know which solutions you will need to use to get rid of it. \n\nPreventing the smell may be quite hard, but you can use some simple ways to ensure your house is always fresh. First, you need to vacuum the house at least twice a week. Although this might not eliminate all the odors, it's the starting point in loosening all the particles which are entrenched in carpet fibers. Methods of dealing with smelly carpets range from home made solutions such as applying baking soda to calling the professional carpet cleaners in Orlando for treatment. Your approach to the job will depend in the power of the smell and also its cause.\n\nPet's urine is the most popular type of odors that gets trapped in the area rugs. Many people sometimes use carpet sprays or powders to remove the smell depending on its strength. If the smell is too strong, you may use a mixture of vinegar and water both in equal measures and then spray using a bottle. You only need to spray and then wait for the carpet to dry. Vinegar is wonderful as it's a bactericide that absorbs odors leaving the carpet fresh as well as smelling great.  \n \nSometimes it may prove to be quite difficult to remove the pet odor. This is because pet's urine has uric acid that makes the carpet very sticky. So if the urine is already dried on the carpet, the fact is that it has penetrated to the carpet pad underneath and thus makes the odor even more difficult to remove. The best and most effective way to remove such types of smells is spraying the mixture of water and vinegar and sprinkling the baking soda on top. However, this might take some minutes to be effective but it's a relatively simple home solution to pet odors. \n\nThe longer pet urine sits the more time that it has to absorb into the carpets and sub-floor. These things need to be treated immediately. So if this simple method doesn't work for you, please be sure and give us a call. We are professionals and will do our best to ensure that your carpets are cleaned, the odors are removed and they are left looking clean and smelling fresh.\n\nCall Carpet Cleaning Orlando today and receive a free carpet analysis when setting your appointment at (407) 307-3337 \n\n\n\ncarpet cleaning Orlando, Orlando carpet cleaning, carpet cleaning Orlando FL, carpet cleaners Orlando, orlando carpet cleaners", "title": "24 hr emergency Carpet Cleaning Orlando", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11T18:12:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-iw2gAlGyLA", "description": "http://www.dolphinstreet.com How to use the Looper on the Line M9 or M13.  http://line6.com\nA looper is a great tool for practicing and even for composing quick ideas.

This temple is believed to have been existing since Treta Yuga. Historical records show that the name was \"Kammamet\"[1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nThe town is located on the banks of a river called Munneru which is a tributary of the Krishna River.

In 1959 Bhadrachalam Revenue Division consisting Bhadrachalam and Manuguru Venkatapuram Taluks of East Godavari district, which were on the other side of the river Godavari were merged into Khammam on grounds of geographical contiguity and administrative viability.\nThere is a festival held in Khammam remembering the old name \"Stambhadri\".\n[edit]Educational institutions\n\nMining University under Osmania is only a major institute.It is located in Kothagudem\n[edit]Geography\n\nKhammam is located at 17.25\u00b0N 80.15\u00b0E.[7] It has an average elevation of 107 metres (351 feet).

He is weak, extremely curious and looking for something he cannot find. Extremely confused, he patrols the area, falls, search again.\nDilated pupils, slight temperature.\nDoesn't drink, eat or use litter.\nDoesn't respond to any stimuli.\nUsually purrs like crazy.\n\"Hallucinating\" might be a good description...\n\nHere is the official description of the condition :\n\nHepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a degenerative disease of the brain caused by severe hepatic insufficiency in advanced liver disease. It is characterized by abnormal mental status, an altered state of consciousness and impaired neurologic function.\nThe most common cause is a congenital abnormality present at birth called a portosystemic shunt. This is an anatomical defect that causes blood to be diverted around the liver instead of passing through the liver. The liver cannot detoxify the blood and the toxins reach the brain and cause the clinical syndrome. Patients with liver failure due to toxic or infectious causes can also exhibit signs of HE.\nThere is no age, sex, or breed predisposition for animals with toxic or infectious liver disease; however, animals with congenital portosystemic shunts are usually brought to the veterinarian within the first year of life. \n\nThis is about our cat :\n\nLiou HAS NO porto systemic shunt and his first crisis appeared when he was 5. All we can do is keep the crisis apart as much as possible.\n\nA crisis last 12 hours, during which he walks, stumbles and sniffs and purrs and looks at something in the air, shiny colours surely as he is.. well.. literally stoned on ammonia !\n\nWe switched his food to LD/KD diet, very light on the liver and kidneys\nWe feed him 3 times a day and take his bowl away when he's done *no more snacks*\nWe give him petalive.com herbal tonics 3 times a day for liver and kidneys. (We're in no way related to this company.)\n\nI don't think the remedies were THE one and only solution but the careful balance of everything apparently works !  Over time we managed to go from every 15 days crisis (!!!) to... 7 months. So I guess we did something right after all.\n\nI want to assure everyone that even in the depth of the crisis and even if the vids aren't always pleasant to look at, this cat doesn't suffer. He purrs like crazy, he has a slight fever *due to the fact he doesn't stop walking for 12 hours straigth, mind you*, doesn't eat or drink *we give him water every 2 hours during the crisis* but he doesn't suffer.\nWe put him in a secure room with tons of soft blankets and stuff so he can't hurt himself. You have to isolate him because something as simple as stairs can be dangerous. He is \"out there\", quite weak and falls easily so, padded room is the best option !\n\n12 hours later, he eats and sleeps like a log. When he wakes up, he's his normal self again but surely with a hell of a headache.\n\nAnd he still is the best cat we could hope for. He's worth every attention.\n\nNot recommended for people NOT working at home...", "title": "Hepatic Encephalopaty - cat 1", "publishedDate": "2009-05-31T16:12:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jCV90FugHY", "description": "", "title": "Interview Exclusive  Aissa La Banda 16 - YouTube", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T14:41:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jCitYSi1Uo", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/haemrapcn\n\nZapraszam do przes\u0142uchania, oceniania, komentowania i subskrybowania. :)\n\nTekst/Rap: Haem\nMix/Master: Haem\nBit:Memories    PIANO RAP BEAT INSTRUMENTAL    Produced by Peacock Beats", "title": "Haem - Przeciwno\u015bci Losu", "publishedDate": "2013-10-06T18:03:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jCuqG9H51s", "description": "ca. 80 Km auf gro\u00dfteils unbefestigten Wegen durch das albanische Hinterland.\nEin echtes Erlebnis f\u00fcr alle Sinne.", "title": "Albanien 2010 - von Borsh nach Kuc", "publishedDate": "2010-09-28T19:05:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jD5_DtstqQ", "description": "Paul Delagnes, lead cake designer at Bread Basket Cake Company's, eHow submission.", "title": "Paul Delagnes - Bread Basket Cake Company", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T17:18:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jD7KoKfOjU", "description": "Hey guys this is my 4 years ago old song baseko Chu which I haven't upload on my YouTube link many people thought it's edge band song but if you guys are my fans then you gonna know my real voice plz support my song !", "title": "Baseko Chu by Brijesh Shrestha (2065 rnb song)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-12T05:30:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jDMpXZc0nU", "description": "This short film was based on improvisations and surprises. The main character came to life scene after scene and the story unfolded as the scenes were improvised without any screenplay. This movie was made without following the rules of movie making. This movie was made by two friends with two DSLR cameras. The story that came out of it is the following. \n\nFabien does not learn. If Fabien were a thing, he would probably be a slot machine. There might be a history tracked deep-down inside of him that might condition the odds but really, what you see is what you get. Sadly for Fabien, the chances of fortune through the chaotic sequence of petty theft, obvious lies and coward tricks he is accustomed to will not lead him to the success he hopes for. The camera follows him tenderly or maybe pitifully, wherever his quest of quick money and quick comfort leads him: market speculations, duty-free cigarettes smuggling, alcohol & women. \n\nThe insignificance of his existence is miraculously interrupted when money borrowed is finally asked back. Forced to face the consequences of his acts, he runs abroad... The misty plains of Flanders replace the crowded streets of Paris. There, in the middle of nowhere, he finds a child, her young mother, a warm house. There was a death, an inheritance: an open spot ? It takes imagination to rewrite one's path, it takes subtlety to fake one's way through the social ladder, it takes charisma to seduce. Bel-Ami without the looks & ambition, Count of Monte-Cristo without the nobility and depth, The Pretender without the intelligence, Fabien is average. Might he have chosen a life less ordinary, Fabien remains trapped in commonplaceness. Armed with his everlasting blank eyes, Fabien has abandoned his cheap suit but not his cheap smile. The wanderings end in front of France's main gate to welfare, thereby completing with a machete the portrait of the unavoidable mediocrity of this man, of Men maybe.\n\nDirector: Dominic Bekaert & Tristan Tr\u00e9gant\nProducer: Dominic Bekaert & Tristan Tr\u00e9gant\nCinematography: Dominic Bekaert\nEditor: Dominic Bekaert\nColor Calibration: Dominic Bekaert\nSound Mixing: Dominic Bekaert\nPrincipal Cast: Tristan Tregant, Pauline Sikirdji, Jean Pierre Billaud, Philippe Pierrard, Julien Cottereau, Elise Touchon\n\nOne of the films in the Euroview- Special Short section of the World Premieres Film Festival.

Among these, one can use seismic, which consists of making a veritable echography of the substratum. A shock on the surface of the ground produces sound waves, which are refracted and reflected below the ground surface. As they pass from one layer to another, their propagation is modified. \n\nThe geophysicist, with the aid of a series of very sensitive microphones called \"geophones\", listens to and records the wave echo from the surface. Reconnaissance of the land being impracticable at sea, use is systematically made of seismic methods. And as a ship moves freely in all directions, the seismic measurements are easier to obtain at sea than on land. The seismic recordings collected by the geophysicist are analysed by highly powerful computers. Thus, images are obtained, in two or three dimensions of the layers constituting the substratum. This seismic imaging is analysed to find out if certain layers are likely to contain hydrocarbons.", "title": "Seismic 3D Imaging | Oil & Gas School", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T10:26:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jJVU_NI6_s", "description": "Spelunky is full of myths and legends, so I will attempt to bust a shopkeeper by feeding him to a piranha plant.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/joehills\nhttp://twitch.tv/joehills\nhttp://instagram.com/JoeHillsTSD\nhttp://anook.com/joehills", "title": "Spelunky Mythbusters: Shopkeeper + Piranha Plant", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15T05:11:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jJywQvnVnc", "description": "RO Membrane Element Understanding", "title": "RO Membrane Element Understanding.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T07:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jK4M-cutnc", "description": "Learn how to trim and prune ornamental grasses, in this free gardening video.\n\nExpert: Amanda Kantor\nBio: Amanda Kantor is the retail manager of Five Acre Farm in Northfeild Ma.

The business is only now being placed on the market due to our clients' wish to retire. Pennels Guest House operates on a bed and breakfast only basis and generates a turnover in the region of \u00a360,000 with a gross profit of 92%. 5 of the letting rooms boast en-suite facilities and all rooms have WiFi and Freeview TVs. A new owner could increase turnover by embarking on a modest marketing campaign, as at present most trade comes from word of mouth referrals. There is a web site in place, which we feel would benefit from the addition of on-line booking facilities. We are advised that there is an adjacent plot of land, with 11 garages, which is available by separate negotiation. The business boasts an enviable reputation with much repeat custom. We feel this is a rare opportunity to acquire a well-established and highly regarded guest house with scope for future growth. Early discussions with Preferred Commercial must come highly recommended.\n\n\nBusiness Status\n\nFor Sale\n\nProperty\n\nFreehold\n\nLocation\n\n\nPennels Guest House is ideally located in a mainly residential area in Kettering, Northamptonshire. The guest house is located on a bus route and is close to the local amenities. There is ample free on-street parking. Kettering is a popular market town set in rural Northamptonshire. The town boasts an excellent modern hospital and good state and private schools along with a conference centre and sports facilities.  Pennels Guest House is located just 1.5 miles from the town centre. There are excellent road links to the A14, M1, M6 and A1.

Clean off the cap with a towel or rag before opening it.\u00a0\nDo not allow dirt or dust to get inside the reservoir.2. Slowly lift the cap without letting any brake fluid drip onto a painted surface; brake fluid is very corrosive and will cause damage to the exterior of the car.\n3. Under the cap you will see designations for the minimum level and maximum level of brake fluid. You want the fluid to be at least at the minimum. Going over the maximum will cause the fluid to spill.\n4. When you determine that your fluid is low, pour the brake fluid inside the reservoir to the maximum line.\u00a0\n5. If you add too much fluid, extract the excess using a syringe or turkey baster.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jU8JIfDwIU&feature=player_embedded\u00a0\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-check-brake-fluid/", "title": "How to Check Your Brake Fluid Level", "publishedDate": "2011-02-17T23:42:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jU_eNLt0Uo", "description": "Copyright \u00a9 Military POC", "title": "India's Multi layered Air Defence   Surface to Air Missiles SAM)  Part 1", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T07:07:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jUp1UR56L0", "description": "", "title": "totalickers    -    terror judicial.", "publishedDate": "2011-03-01T21:48:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jVKgPe5rcE", "description": "Colossus Takes on the Juggernaut, When he is not able to the X-Men intervene and give a helping hand.

I discover in it the pulsebeats of a higher life in humanity. \n\nLike primitive Christianity, there will be much that will try to fasten itself upon it that has no vital connection with it, and it will be opposed by the modern scribes, or \" letter-men\" of the law, and by a narrow, Pharisaic bigotry, and even Herod may seek to slay the young child, but nevertheless the infant is fully born, like Minerva or wisdom, from the brain of Jupiter, and the child will increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. \n\nBut, let us bear in mind that the movement, if it signifies anything of a permanent value to the world, means a higher development of the spiritual life of man. It is only in this way that we can ever hope to attain to the mastery of pain and disease by the mind (or thinking principle), in the dethronement of the bodily senses, and the establishment of the empire of the spirit in us, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all other dominions must serve and obey it. \n\nThe overthrow of the \"fourth kingdom\" of Daniel, the \"iron age\" of Greek and Roman mythology, and which marks the reign in us of materialism and sensualism in religion and science, is accomplished by the \"mystic stone\" cut without hands from the mountain,\u2014the symbol of the celestial degree of life,\u2014 and which is identical with the \" white stone \" of the Apocalypse, and the \"philosopher's stone\" of the Alchemists, and this, as Trithemius affirms, is none other than our own immortal and divine spirit.

Ouspensky. This story, however, is a work of fiction mingled with the personal tale of an exalted youthful love experienced during the time of the author's travels throughout southern Europe. The transformative experience of an encounter with the goddess on a solitary road in the Pyrenees mountains is the seminal event leading to all subsequent experiences. The fateful encounters with his love are sporadic, but occupy a long period of time encompassing travels on two continents. The young woman whom the author befriends has qualities of an intensely focused aesthetic sensibility combined with a childlike purity and trustfulness of heart. This tale is dedicated to the feminine principle absorbed by the male psyche.

Formally, the quantum state of a particular electron is defined by its wave function, a complex-valued function of space and time. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the position of a particular electron is not well defined until an act of measurement causes it to be detected. The probability that the act of measurement will detect the electron at a particular point in space is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the wavefunction at that point.\n\nAn energy is associated with each electron configuration and, upon certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one orbital to another by emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.\n\nKnowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements. The concept is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together. In bulk materials this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Arrangement Of Electrons In An Atoms", "publishedDate": "2010-05-03T10:26:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jrpauCJR_Y", "description": "Jodiendo tocando \"smells like the teen spirit\" en la fiesta de cumple de henry y menzo.\n\nHenry (bajista de Los Neruda  y Alfacentauro): en la guitarra.\nPirri (Bajista de Saltamontesdepapel): en el bajo.\nMenzo (guitarrista de saltamontesdepapel): en la bateria.\nel pana juan en la voz jodiendo..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.myspace.com/saltamontesdepapel\nwww.myspace.com/menzosdp", "title": "Nirvana cover - Jamming in birthday 13/04", "publishedDate": "2008-04-15T02:28:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jruFNQTBDc", "description": "Brenden Dewar, 13 years old, from Pueblo, Colorado, sings Hear Me from Imagine Dragons.

It can be an effective tool. A laser around the nerves, if used with indiscretion, it can hurt the spine. It can hurt the nerve. You have to be very careful with a laser. When it's appropriate, it's a good modality. It's not a cure-all. It's not a panacea. It's not the perfect fit for every spinal problem. Lasers can be effective, but there's nothing magical about lasers. Typically someone who's a younger individual with a one-level isolated disc problem off to the side - catching the nerve root only... typically those are the best candidates for spine laser surgery. Many of the surgeries are day surgeries. Have it done; go home same day. We get you up. We get you walking almost immediately.

Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.\n31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.", "title": "1049 Galatians 4 Chronological Bible (Fulness of the time)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-01T22:25:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jylDaMWBzA", "description": "", "title": "IglooFest 26-01-2013 GoPro H3 Part 5 -Old Port Montrea", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T01:21:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-jyqr24ToK0", "description": "In this video, BreeZe shows off what he believe's to be the best defense in NBA 2K15..

The word About this sound \"tickle\" (help\u00b7info) evolved from the Middle English tikelen, perhaps frequentative of ticken, to touch lightly.[1] The idiom tickled pink means to be pleased or delighted.[2]\n\nIn 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a \"tickle\" as two different types of phenomena.[3] One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter-inducing \"heavy\" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to \"ticklish\" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.\n\nThe question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.[4]\n\nFrancis Bacon and Charles Darwin belie", "title": "Amagami SS Heel Stomp", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T16:39:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-k2cWD2mjhQ", "description": "Kirk Sorensen is featured", "title": "Thorium fuel of the future.

We focus our work of course, on the areas of bankruptcy and foreclosure defense. But bankruptcy and foreclosure defense in Chicago frequently takes us other places. What do I mean by that? Lots of times, people want to prepare to avoid bankruptcy, and so they would like to protect their assets. Asset protection requires estate planning, and so we do a little bit of that.\n\nIn addition, sometimes people are not concerned so much about asset protection for bankruptcy, but asset protection in the event of their getting older. They want to protect themselves for Medicaid purposes. Elder law has become an area where we practice as well.\n\nAnother thing that we found out was that bankruptcy and probate have a lot in-common. Why? Probate is basically bankruptcy for dead people. It involves a special code, the probate code, a special court, the probate court, and wills and trusts and estates are not so different than bankruptcy plans. The knowledge that we have in bankruptcy has helped us in probate.\n\nThen, in the mortgage foreclosure field, we find that we have been involved in the buying and selling of real estate. Well, buying and selling of real estate short sales requires that we do some real estate transactions. In bankruptcy, we buy and sell assets all of the time, so you have to have asset purchases and sales. We know small businesses. We can start them up, and we can close them down too. Sometimes, when we represent not-for-profit organizations, we help organize those and close them down too.\n\nEven though we are a firm that focuses on bankruptcy and foreclosure defense, you will find that there are many other things that we do that might be helpful to you. We'd like to think of you as our clients, and we'd like to think of us as your lawyers. So if something else comes up that's not something that we do particularly, let us know.\n\nWe know people that are the best of the best in every area of law, and we will find them, put them on your case, and make sure they do what's supposed to be done for you.", "title": "Chicago Bankruptcy Lawyer | David Leibowitz | (847) 249-9100 | LakeLaw.com | Fiduciary", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T20:09:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kGhx1Yo1Ac", "description": "Is this the symbolism of National integrity and brotherhood towards fellow Telugu brethren?", "title": "Seemandhras vulgarity towards fellow Indians", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T22:47:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kGsp8p5R-I", "description": "Sponsored by Dynamic Essentialz.

The Dumb Friends League Furry Scurry is an annual two-mile walk for animals that takes place at Denver's Washington Park on the first Saturday in May. \n(This Footage is a Small Part of the Big Event Video - To watch, visit http://www.YouTube.com/AboutColoradoTV)\n\nA fun game for dog\nDoes your dog love to chase? Would you like to give your dog more exercise by way of a fun game? Run Dog Run Lure Chasing is what you and your dog have been looking for.\n\nRun Dog Run Lure Chasing offers various pricing options for your dog to run, chase, and play. For 1st time dogs, we allow a free short test run to determine their interest level in the fun game of lure chasing. While most dogs absolutely love to chase the lure because of their natural prey instincts, unfortunately, some dogs may not show any interest at all in this game. Lure chasing is similar to most games, so you will probably see quite an improvement in chasing the lure as your dog learns after a few runs. Once your dog shows its love for the game, you should consider purchasing volume run punch card tickets. Runs on your punch card ticket may be used for any of our non fundraiser run days, plus you can share them with other dog owners. You don't have to use all of your run punches the day you purchase your card. Punch card tickets are also a great gift idea for dog owners!\n1 Run Punch Card Ticket = $10\n3 Run Punch Card Ticket = $20\n5 Run Punch Card Ticket = $30\n10 Run Punch Card Ticket = $50\n\nAs the Dumb Friends League's largest annual fundraiser, more than 12,000 people and 5,000 dogs join us for the walk and raise funds for the homeless pets in our care. The Furry Scurry has become a tradition for many Denver-area residents.\n\n- See More at http://www.YouTube.com/AboutColoradoTV\n\nFurry Scurry participants enjoy refreshments, contests, demonstrations and more than 150 pet-related sponsors and vendors at our \"Flea-less Market.\" \n\nWhether you're looking for the latest innovations in pet toys or a tasty treat from a local food truck, you can find it all at the Furry Scurry. \n\nEnjoy refreshments and demonstrations before, during and after the walk.\n\nShop the Flea-less Market for pet-friendly merchandise and services offered by more than 150 sponsors and vendors.\nFirst-timer or pro, head over to the Zoom Room agility course for a run through the obstacles. \n\nTest your dog's speed at lure coursing and try for your best time. \nEnter our Pet/Person Look-alike, Best Trick and Best Tail Wagger contests.\n\n- See More at http://www.YouTube.com/AboutColoradoTV", "title": "Dog Lure Chasing 120th & Sheridan, Denver at the Furry Scurry", "publishedDate": "2014-05-03T22:24:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kKTIJNKZMg", "description": "http://www.gaviningham.com/sales-juice-video-sales-training/.

On a daily basis I find it more effective (and certainly more enjoyable) than prescription anti-spasmodic drugs, particularly when it's brewed as a very strong tea.\n\nIn fact, peppermint is such a powerful muscle relaxant that it can trigger GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) or heartburn in people who are susceptible. If you are prone to these upper GI problems, avoid mint and stick to the other IBS herbs and spices such as high volatile oil fennel or ginger.\n\nOne of the easiest and most effective way to use peppermint for IBS is to brew it (fresh or dried) with boiling water into hot tea (do not actually boil the herb in water as this can destroy its volatile oils, and thus its effectiveness). Peppermint, however, is available in several other beneficial forms as well.\n\nEnteric-coated peppermint oil capsules can be taken before meals to help prevent IBS symptoms. These capsules have been proven highly effective (and safe) in several clinical trials, including studies that focused specifically on children with IBS. These capsules are specially coated so they don't dissolve in the stomach (which could trigger heartburn); instead, they dissolve in the intestines, where they act as a smooth muscle relaxant and pain killer.", "title": "Peppermint Tea - Help for Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Peppermint Tea Ibs", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T02:51:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kfV8-9u4kM", "description": "Como activar el TuneUp Utilities 2014 para siempre\nDatos a ingresar:\nNombre:Ingresan su nombre o uno cualquiera\nOrganizaci\u00f3n:No ponen nada\nClave del producto:ingresan alguno de estos seriales\nTMACO-HRNAV-OZGB2-ADQKE-WC2K2-XCY2J\n                         -------OTRO--------                                     \n2RD1XW-8H6T5X-RVE8DP-CJA615-6E8NCY-N5EJ3\u00adF\n\nMi p\u00e1gina WEB:http://sparktutorialesbyfranco.es.tl/Bienvenida.htm\n\nSeguime en mis redes sociales!!:\nGrupo de facebook(puedes promocionarte aqu\u00ed):https://www.facebook.com/groups/1456996214520107/\n\nGoogle+:https://plus.google.com/u/0/113721703497138517293/posts\n\nP\u00e1gina de facebook:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Franco-Tutoriales/254697564688578\n\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/FrancoBorsani15\n-----------------------------------\nVideo:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfV8-9u4kM", "title": "Como activar el TuneUp Utilities 2014 para siempre | Spark Tutoriales", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T20:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kfsG7p1hSk", "description": "Your DIY Thyroid Check: The simple cancer screening you can do right now", "title": "How To Do A Thyroid Neck Check Self-Exam", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T16:17:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-kg3-VuwRqE", "description": "Protesters teaching their children to farm at the main democracy protest venue at Admiralty, Hong Kong.

Although, it that does play a major part since there are only three. \n\nWe are a byproduct of these simple things. When you hear what they are they are almost to simple that we practically ignore the effects that it can truly have on our lives.\n\nAn old mentor shared with me a simple formula for shaping whom you become or who we have become today. This formula made me really look at my life objectively. I began to take inventory of these three simple things and I realized that were true and universal principles. What is fascinating is that most people don't realize that they are in full affect in their current live.\n\nHere are the three things that shape who we are and what we can become in the future.\n\n1. The people we associate with (Do you want the lifestyle of the people you associate with? Are they challenging you to become better? Who is on your current speed dial on your cell phone?)\n2. The books we read (Most people stop reading books after high school.)\n3. The trainings and events we attend. (Are you getting yourself in a position to re-sharpen the saw, or to better master your craft or your increasing your value?)\n\nMy challenge for you is; take inventory and make adjustments so that you are living the life you truly want to live.\n\n\"Create Your Waves and Live Your Dreams\"\nDagoZuniga.com\nDifferenceDream.com", "title": "We Are A ByProduct Of These Three Things by Dago Zuniga", "publishedDate": "2014-01-19T01:39:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ko40dfnFuY", "description": "ORDER NOW http://tinyurl.com/IsaLean-Pro-Shakes-Isagenix\nJOIN NOW http://bit.ly/1aM6S5C\n\nOrder NOW to begin your IsaLean Pro shakes and get on the track of a better version of you today!
