A single authenticating ID would guard access to the Internet, online data and most commerce. It is nothing short of an attempt to phase in a Mark of the Beast system, and a prominent Bilderberg attendee is behind the scheme.\n\nNeelie Kroes is the EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner, and is introducing legislation she hopes will force \"the adoption of harmonised e-signatures, e-identities and electronic authentication services (eIAS) across EU member states.\"\n\nThe extent of such a system would, of course, expand over time, particularly as many EU nations have resisted the big government encroachment of ID requirements on civil rights grounds, which even now smack of the Nazi regime's draconian \"papers please\" policies that empowered their other avenues of tyranny. According to EurActiv.com, Neelie Kroes would later \"widen the scope of the current Directive by including also ancillary authentication services that complement e-signatures, like electronic seals, time/date stamps, etc,\" as the supra-national body attempts to corral more nations into participation.\n\nThis big brother system will be implemented in Europe first and later pushed in North America and the remainder of the globe, as the world is nudged step by step towards a total cashless control grid in the name of 'safe, verifiable commerce,' and of course, in the name of \"security.\" Nevermind that the plan would invite the hacking of identities and fast track forgeries. In the case of Europe, special emphasis is placed in part on \"establishing a truly functioning single market\" \u2014 part of the larger EU goal even now floundering.\n\nNeelie Kroes has been a long term Bilderberg attendee, showing up annually since 2005. She was on the official list for the 2006 meeting in Ottawa, Canada, then the 2007 meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, 2008 in Chantilly, Virginia, 2009 in Vouliagmeni, Greece and 2010 in Sitges, Spain as a delegate from the European Commission.\n\nBut in 2011, Kroes came to the table in St. Moritz, Switzerland with a new title: the EU's Commissioner for Digital Agenda, so obviously now seeing development on that agenda was not unexpected. Kroes latest effort will surely be bolstered during the 2012 meeting now just days away.\nhttp://www.infowars.com/mark-of-the-beast-bilderberg-pushing-internet-id-in-e...\nby Aaron Dykes\n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.tv/\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/RealAlexJones\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerikJones\n[Checkout Alex's New Social Network-'Planet Infowars'\nhttp://planet.infowars.com/", "title": "EU Demands ID Chip for all European Citizens.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T10:46:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "47WpF1l-2bM", "description": "HOF FREEZE DRYING SYSTEMS\n\nThe Specialist for individual Solutions\n\nwww.hof-sonderanlagen.com\n\nWith over 24 years of experience, HOF Sonderanlagenbau GmbH is the leading specialist in the manufacture of individual freeze drying systems, loading and unloading systems, as well as freeze-thaw units for the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry.\n\nAt our company location in Lohra, near Marburg, Germany, highly motivated and specially qualified employees work on the company's own production floor of some 12,500m\u00b2.

Wondering what is the mesothelium?\":\nMesothelial tissue also harbors testes in men and women. They are called visceral mesothelium.\nMesothelium is a kind of simple squamous epithelium. The main function of the mesothelium - hides and protects the internal organs. To the light you can see that the surface is covered with tiny fibers of the mesothelium. The villi are lubricated with serous fluid and proteins, which allows the internal organs without consequences to rub against each other.\nMesothelium is also involved in the movement of fluids within the body, promoting leukocytes in inflammation, protect against infections and more.\nIt is from the mesothelial cells exposed to asbestos and formed a rare but deadly form of cancer - mesothelioma.", "title": "Mesothelium.

They are particularly astounding when the afternoon sunlight is blazing through their petals, and always attractive to the bees.

The fruits also contain more vitamin C than lemons (up to 150 mg/100 g). I like to use the fragrant fruits as pleasant-smelling paperweights. \n\nThese shrubs are a good source of colour, and always give that magical cottage garden feel. Very drought-resistant, too, and can withstand quite hot and dry conditions. But they do better with some water and attention.\n\nI multiply japonicas from suckers, taken in coldest winter when the plant is dormant. I have also grown them from seeds, which is fun, too, as you never know what colour the offspring will be.

Females have high fecundity and can lay up to 12 million eggs at once. They reach sexual maturity once they are about 75--125 cm in length. Spawning usually occurs in late spring to early summer.[4] Their three distinct levels of development usually occur in varying habitats. The first stage, the leptocephalus stage, or stage one, is completed after 20--30 days. It takes place in clear, warm oceanic waters, usually within 10--20 m of the surface. The leptocephalus shrinks as it develops into a larva; the most shrunken larva, stage two, develops by day 70. This is due to a negative growth phase followed by a sluggish growth phase. By day 70, the juvenile growth phase, stage three, begins and the fish begins to rapidly grow until it reaches sexual maturity.[2][6]", "title": "Swimming with some Massive Tarpon bvi 2013 part 2", "publishedDate": "2013-04-14T23:48:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "47stUzGUkvs", "description": "Outside the CNN Building in Hollywood (Sunset & Caheunga), the #MAMSM rally demands \"CNN, come out!

It at least allows viewers a slight taste of what Cuba looks like outside of Havana. This narration is the sanitized official stuff all tourist hear. The real Cuba awaits all who dare rent or hire a car to see this country on your own terms, which is the best way to take in the dwindling Castro regime and the kind spirited nature of the Cuban people.  This was my 3rd trip there. When I return for my 4th trip Castro will be gone and cocaine, guns, and criminal corruption will be there as it was before the revolution in 1959. The only good thing about communism is that it makes people fear their government and keeps tourists like me really safe. Detroit is dangerous. Havana is not.

De vrouw is overgebracht naar het ziekenhuis.\n\nDe vrouw zat omstreeks 20.40 uur als passagier in een auto bestuurd door een 37-jarige man eveneens uit Heerenveen.\nDe automobilist botste op de A28 ter hoogte van Rouveen in de richting Zwolle achter op een vrachtwagen. Met een zwaar beschadigde auto reed hij in eerste instantie tientallen kilometers door. Uiteindelijk strandde hij bovenop het viaduct over de A32 bij Steenwijk-Noord. Daar zag een berger de gestrande auto in de berm staan en schakelde de hulpdiensten in.\n\nDe vrouw bleek een fikse hoofdwond te hebben. Zij werd uit voorzorg gestabiliseerd uit de auto gehaald. Hiervoor moest de middenstijl uit de auto worden geknipt door de brandweer. De vrouw werd naar de Isalakliniek in Zwolle overgebracht waar zij aan haar verwonding is behandeld.\n\nDe bestuurder van de vrachtauto, een 47-jarige man uit Letland, had zelf kort na de aanrijding contact opgenomen met de politie.\nHij bleek door de aanrijding ook een aantal plastic zakken en spanbanden te hebben verloren die hierdoor over een deel van de A28 verspreid lag.\nDit leverde een gevaarlijke situatie op. Een deel van de rijbanen is hierdoor korte tijd afgekruist totdat de rommel door agenten was verwijderd.\n\nDe bestuurder van de auto, de man uit Heerenveen, bleek onder invloed van alcohol (535 ug/l). Hij krijgt proces-verbaal.\n\nBron: www.regiomeppel.nl", "title": "Automobilist rijdt tientallen kilometers met zwaar beschadigde auto na ongeval", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T22:35:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "486H6owZjVE", "description": "Brief island tour, places to go and things to see.

Inner Mongolia is a Providence in North Central China. Directly above is actually Mongolia and above Mongolia is Russia. The capital of Inner Mongolia is Hohhot (aka Huhehot or Huhhot). If you know Chinese pinyin then for the Chinese it is pronounced as hehohaotu. If you just say Hohhot they will have no idea what you are talking about. There are many Mongolians in this area and lots of Mongolian culture as well. Of course lots of artifacts and statues of Genghis Khan too.\n\nA friend took me to a bull frog restaurant. Even though i was a little reluctant to eat it i did. I didnt pick the bull frogs for them to kill and skin. My friend had to do that for me as i could not watch. Anyway to me it taste like an in-between to a fish and chicken. \n\nAlso in this area i ate horse and camel for the first time in my life. Nice experience and everything was relatively pretty cheap in this area. \n\nOh and too bad i was not able to visit the grasslands and mountains. I heard it is absolutely breath-taking. Next time for sure i will visit these areas.

It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and its tolerance of a broad range of habitats. Native to South, Central and Southeast Asia, troops of Macaca mulatta inhabit a great variety of habitats from grasslands to arid and forested areas, but also close to human settlements.\n\nThe rhesus macaque is brown or grey in color and has a pink face, which is bereft of fur. Its tail is of medium length and averages between 20.7 and 22.9 cm (8.1 and 9.0 in). Adult males measure approximately 53 cm (21 in) on average and weigh about 7.7 kg (17 lb). Females are smaller, averaging 47 cm (19 in) in length and 5.3 kg (12 lb) in weight. Rhesus macaques have on average 50 vertebrae. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm length to leg length) is 89%. They have dorsal scapulae and a wide rib cage.\n\nThe rhesus macaque has 32 teeth with a dental formula of 2.1.2.3/2.1.2.3 and bilophodont molars. The upper molars have four cusps: paracone, metacone, protocone and hypocone. The lower molars also have four cusps: metaconid, protoconid, hypoconid and entoconid.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Now they have a new surgical option, a vascularized lymph node transfer, which is expected to bring relief and life changing results.\nThe surgical team at Orlando Health performed the first ever vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) in the state of Florida. This microsurgical procedure transfers lymph nodes from one area of the body to another that is affected by a blockage in the lymphatic vessels, also called lymphedema. The surgery is expected to reduce a patient's symptoms such as swelling and heaviness and relieve their pain and discomfort, which will allow them to use their arms and legs again and resume their daily activities. The surgery was followed LIVE by thousands of people on Orlando Health's social media channels including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Google+ and YouTube:\n\nDr. Richard Klein, who oversees MD Anderson Cancer Center Orlando's Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Center, Dr. Kenneth Lee and Dr. Jeffrey Feiner brought VLNT to Orlando Health, which is the first and only hospital system in the state of Florida to offer the procedure. Drs. Klein, Lee and Feiner are among a handful of surgeons in the country who are currently performing this unrenowned procedure to treat lymphedema.\n\"We see a good amount of patients suffering from lymphedema and no one had a cure other than conservative efforts such as massaging and compressions, so we started aggressively looking for surgical outcomes,\" said Dr. Richard Klein, plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Orlando Health. \"This procedure has the potential to change the lives of these patients and so many other men, women and children who are affected by lymphedema who until now had very little options for treatment.\"\nJean Hutchinson, a breast cancer patient who developed lymphedema in her right arm following breast surgery and radiation, was the first person in Florida to undergo the vascularized lymph node transfer.  Hutchinson has been living with lymphedema for 18 months, which serves as a daily reminder of her cancer and limits her day-to-day activities. During surgery, the surgeons transferred lymph nodes from Hutchinson's abdomen to her arm pit and reconnected arteries and veins to provide the transferred lymph nodes oxygen and nutrients to survive, thrive and develop new lymphatic tissue.\nLymphedema affects 3-4 million adults and children in America and is, unfortunately, not an uncommon side effect of breast cancer treatment in about 15-20 percent of patients, where lymph nodes have been damaged or removed along with breast tissue (mastectomy) in combination with radiation. Other less common cause of lymphedema can include any cancer where lymph nodes have to be removed as part of treatment or diagnosis, trauma to the lymphatic system, infection and congenital disorders. In third-world countries the most common cause is parasitic infection. \nLymphedema prevents lymph fluid from draining from the tissues in the body and, as a result, fluid builds up and causes swelling and soreness to one of the extremities and there is a significant increase in the risk of infection in the affected limb. In many cases, lymphedema causes chronic wounds and ulcers and breakdown of the skin. \n\nPrior to the VLNT procedure, Hutchinson went through lymphatic therapy to prepare her body for surgery. The VLNT procedure takes approximately 3 to 4 hours. Lymphatic studies after this procedure have shown growth of new vessels and active function of the transferred lymph nodes and patients begin to see improvement within 1 to 2 months following the surgery. Patients undergo additional therapy post-surgery to gain mobility in their arms or legs.", "title": "Orlando Health performs Florida's first Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T21:00:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "48XD7Z9_XXs", "description": "Optimal Vision Eyewear at http://www.visio-rx.com\n\nThe term is used all the time, but what exactly does it mean? 20/20 vision is a term relating to the way visual acuity is determined. Visual acuity refers to the clearness of your vision. This number is determined sometime during a routine eye exam, by use of a Snellen chart (one with rows of different letters of varying sizes) or a \"tumbling E chart\" (with E's facing in various directions and sizes).\n\nWhile we commonly think of 20/20 as 'perfect vision'. you can have better than perfect vision. View this video to find out how.\n\n\nEyewear Which Makes You see - at http://www.visio-rx.com\nYou will not be disappointed!\n\n\n\nYou hear the term all the time, but what does 20/20 vision actually mean?\n\n20/20 means that you can see at 20 feet away what a person with normal sight can see at 20 feet. The number is an indication of your visual acuity. \n\nIf you can only see the top E, that means you can see at 20 feet what a person with normal sight can see at 200 feet. This is called 20/200 vision. \n\nIf you can read this row, you have 20/40 vision: Normal sight sees at 40 feet what you see at 20 feet.\n\nWhen you are able to read this row (called 20/10 vision), it means that you can see at 20 feet what normal sight can see at 10 feet. This means you have exceptional sight.\n\nThe first number refers to the 20 feet you are away from the chart. Even if the chart isn't 20 feet from you, the chart is scaled to look like it's 20 feet away through the use of projectors and mirrors.\n\nThis number always refers to \"normal sight\". The bigger the letters, the bigger the number. The smaller the letters you can read on the chart from 20 feet away, the better your visual acuity is.\n\nYour visual acuity is usually measured with and without  corrective measures, to verify that the prescription is sufficient.\n\n\n#F22", "title": "What does \"20/20 Vision\" mean?

Auch junge Hamatocactus setispinus treiben bereits Bl\u00fcten, diese sind gelb gef\u00e4rbt, in der Mitte rot und duften sehr gut.\nPflege des Hamatocactus / Kulturanleitung\nLicht / Standort\n\nHamatocactus ben\u00f6tigen f\u00fcr einen gesunden Wuchs unbedingt viel Sonnenlicht. Wenn die Kakteen ganzj\u00e4hrig der Sonne ausgesetzt sind, bilden sie sch\u00f6n gef\u00e4rbte Dornen und auch Bl\u00fcten. Wer die M\u00f6glichkeit hat, sollte diese W\u00fcstenkakteen im Sommer auf die Terrasse oder einen sonnigen Balkon stellen.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nEin Hamatocactus wird w\u00e4hrend der Wachstumsphase nur m\u00e4\u00dfig gegossen, man sollte die oberste Substratschicht vor dem n\u00e4chsten W\u00e4ssern immer antrocknen lassen. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhephase ben\u00f6tigen diese W\u00fcstenkakteen praktisch kein Wasser. Man achte also nur darauf, dass das Substrat nicht vollst\u00e4ndig vertrocknet.\nTemperatur\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Zeit des Wachstums kommt der Hamatocactus mit den \u00fcblichen Zimmertemperaturen gut zurecht. In der Ruhephase eigen sich Temperaturen zwischen 4 und 8 Grad \u00b0C\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\n\u00dcblicherweise bildet der Hamatocactus keine Seitentriebe aus. Deshalb zieht man einen Hamatocactus aus Samen heran. Samen f\u00fcr diese W\u00fcstenkakteen sind im Handel erh\u00e4ltlich.\nErde / Substrat\n\nDiese W\u00fcstenkakteen bekommen ein Substrat aus drei Teilen grober Komposterde und einem Teil scharfem Sand. Man achte unbedingt darauf, dass das Gemisch locker und gut wasserdurchl\u00e4ssig ist.\nUmtopfen\n\nIm zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr kontrolliert man die Wurzelbildung der Kakteen. Hierzu nimmt man den Hamatocactus vorsichtig aus seinem Topf. Wenn die Wurzeln einen sehr dichten Ballen gebildet haben, wird der Hamatocactus in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Topf umgepflanzt. Auch der Abstand der Kaktee zu dem Topfrand sollte 2 cm nicht unterschreiten. Falls die Wurzelbildung noch nicht so stark ausgepr\u00e4gt ist und ein Umzug in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Topf noch nicht notwendig ist, so sch\u00fcttelt man bei der Kontrolle die alte Erde vorsichtig aus dem Wurzelballen des Hamatocactus heraus und ersetzt sie durch frisches Substrat.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nIm Fr\u00fchjahr und Sommer verabreicht man dem Hamatocactus alle zwei Wochen einen kalireichen Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger. W\u00e4hrend der lichtarmen, winterlichen Ruheperiode werden die Kakteen nicht ged\u00fcngt.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\nSchmierl\u00e4use / Wolll\u00e4use\n\nDer Befall mit diesen Pflanzensch\u00e4dlingen wird \u00f6fter an Kakteen beobachtet. Das kleine, wei\u00dfe, an Watteb\u00e4usche erinnernde Gespinst der Wolll\u00e4use ist gut auf den Bl\u00e4ttern der befallenen Pflanzen zu erkennen.\n Schmierl\u00e4use bek\u00e4mpfen\nGefahr von Russtau\n\nie Areolen von Hamatocactus setispinus scheiden eine Fl\u00fcssigkeit aus, auf der sich schwarzer Schimmel rasch entwickelt. Wenn diese Erkrankung auftritt, sp\u00fclt man die Stelle mit warmem Wasser ab und stellt den Hamatocactus zum Trocknen an einen warmen Platz.", "title": "Sortenbeschreibung & Arten des Hamatocactus", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T22:17:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "48wx2syHZdA", "description": "\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u0650\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064f\u062c\u0651\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u0627\u062a\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0649 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0641\u064a \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0638\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0650\u062f\u0627\u064b \u200f\u0648\u064e\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0650\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0627\u064b \u062d\u064e\u062a\u0651\u0649 \u062a\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0643\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0637\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0651\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u064e\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0627\u064b.\u200f \u200e\n* * * * *\nO Allah!

Do I have to apply base coat first?\n- Yes. On all my nail arts, I always use base coat. It protects your nails and prevents the nail polish from chipping instantly. \n\n2.) Should the nail polish be dried before applying the newspaper?\n-I found that 100% dry polish is difficult to stain since the coat has already been sealed. Wait until the nail polish is 90% dry and only 10% wet. 90% dry polish is not completely hard so it actually eats the ink and so the text will appear darker and readable.\n\n3.) Can I use water?\n-YES! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=495xsppG_HY\n\n4.) Can I use alcohol?\n- YES! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcmO0R3Kqzo\n\n5.) Can I use magazine/music note/printed paper instead of newspaper?\n-YES! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJHh1im30C4\n\n6.) Can I use nail polish remover instead of alcohol?\n-NO! Nail polish remover's main purpose is to actually REMOVE the nail polish on your nails. If you use it, you won't be able to come up with a decent nail art but just a really messy one.\n\n7.) Can I use mouth wash/wine/astringent/perfume instead of alcohol?\n-Love, please don't waste your money. Just use water! :)\n\n8.) Why did you use q-tip/cotton bud?\n-I found that rubbing the paper actually makes the ink stain more on the nail. Pressing the newspaper on the nail for about 30 seconds is also effective if you don't want to use q-tip\n\nI hope I was able to answer your questions! Enjoy doing your nails! ^_^\n___________________________________________\n\nBLOG http://www.realasianbeauty.com\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/RealAsianBeautyYT\nInstagram - http://followgram.me/realasianbeauty\n\n\u2665 \u2665 \u2665\n\nThis is my 3rd Newspaper Nail Art Video.

(The Coriolis force is also known as the Coriolis effect).\n\nPlease contact me if you would like a stand-alone high-quality wmv file \nfor academic purposes.\n\nThe first example shows a cannon fixed to a rotating disc. The cannonballs \nfly in straight lines since once shot no force acts on them. When\nthis scene is viewed from the disc's frame of reference (i.e., as would\nbe seen by a viewer that stands on the disc) the cannonballs seem to\nfly in a curved path. This demonstrates that in a rotating frame of reference\none must take into account the Coriolis and Centrifugal forces.\n(Read more about them in Wikipedia: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force,\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect)\n\nThe second example shows a pendulum swinging over a rotating disc.\nA pendulum swinging through a small angle approximates what is called \"harmonic motion\"\nin which the ball is pulled to the center by a force proportional to\nits distance to the center. In the pendulum, the string exerts a force\nwhose vertical component balances gravity and the horizontal component\n(shown in the clip) causes the harmonic motion (approximately).\nThe disc and the pendulum has the same period,\n meaning both complete a cycle at the same time.\n\nWhen viewed from the disc's frame of reference the centrifugal and Coriolis\nforces appear yet again. This time the centrifugal force balances \nthe string's horizontal component. This is because the centrifugal force is \nalso proportional to the distance from the center but pushing outward instead \nof inward. The equal periods make the factor of proportion the same for both.\nThis leaves the Coriolis force alone to act on the ball. Since it is always\nperpendicular to the object's path, this creates a perfectly circular path.\n\nFinally, we decrease the pendulum's period to be 2/3 of the disc's period.\nNow the centrifugal force no longer balances that of the string and the \nmotion becomes more complicated.\n\nVisit our sponsors: http://www.therockerspaniels.com", "title": "Visualization of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces", "publishedDate": "2007-12-29T19:10:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "49K1LQTTxLI", "description": "Hangm\u00e9rn\u00f6k: Sz.M.Attila\n\u00a9 2014 AviDan Production\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AviDan.Production", "title": "Insect - Barmok istene (2014. \u00faj dal)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T17:49:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "49KcrtXOLVg", "description": "Is it possible to see red light diffraction on a blu-ray disk? \n\nOptical disks like the cd rom, the dvd and the blu ray disk with their fine grid show coloured diffraction. Analysing the reflection of sunlight from a cd rom shows that the two inner spectral rings are both the first order spectrum. Each spot on the cd reflects the spectrum into two directions: to the inside, across the axis to the inner circle and to the outside, to the outer circle. The second order is further outside and widely spread so that it is comparably dark. \n\nThe colour for each angle can be calculated and drawn in a chart for the disks. The bluray disk with its 320nm grid shows no diffraction when the light comes perpendicular to the disk surface. When the light comes under the observation angle the path difference is doubled. \n\nThis can be done with observing the disk with the light shining over the shoulder of the observer. In this way the cd displays high number of diffractions which mostly overlap to white light. From 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 the dvd shows the 3. order diffraction which is blue. \n\nAnd finally the blu ray disk really shows all colours up to red light of 640nm. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nLichtbeugung an optischen Speichern \nKann man rote Lichtbeugung an einer Blu Ray Disk sehen?\n\nOptische Speicher wie die CD Rom, die DVD und die Blu Ray Disk mit ihren feinen Gitterstrukturen zeigen farbige Reflexionen. Eine genauere Betrachtung des reflektierten Sonnenlichts von einer CD zeigt, dass die beiden inneren Ringe beide zum Spektrum erster Ordnung geh\u00f6ren. Jede Stelle der CD reflektiert das Spektrum in zwei Richtungen, nach innen, \u00fcber die Achse zum inneren Ring, und nach au\u00dfen zum \u00e4u\u00dferen Ring. Das Spektrum zweiter Ordnung liegt weiter drau\u00dfen und ist damit vergleichsweise dunkel. \n\nDie Farbe f\u00fcr jeden Winkel kann berechnet  und in einem Diagramm aufgetragen werden. F\u00fcr den senkrechten Einfall ergibt sich bei der Blu Ray Disk gar keine sichtbare Beugung. L\u00e4sst man das Licht nicht senkrecht zur Scheibe sondern unter dem Beobachtungswinkel einfallen, dann wird der Gangunterschied doppelt so gro\u00df. \n\nMan kann sich dazu als Betrachter das Licht \u00fcber die Schulter scheinen lassen w\u00e4hrend man die Scheibe betrachtet. Dabei ergeben sich f\u00fcr die CD viele Spektren die sich weitgehend zu wei\u00dfem Licht \u00fcberlappen. Im Bereich von 80\u00b0 bis 90\u00b0 sieht man so auf der DVD die Beugung 3. Ordnung die an dieser Stelle blau ist. \n\nAuf der Blu Ray Disk sieht man dann in diesem Winkelbereich tats\u00e4chlich rotes Licht mit einer Wellenl\u00e4nge von bis zu 640nm.", "title": "Red Diffraction on a Blu-Ray", "publishedDate": "2008-02-08T21:18:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "49KqvZoSyfo", "description": "Se Kollektivet hver fredag kl. 17:55 p\u00e5 TV 2!\nProgrammet ser du ogs\u00e5 gratis p\u00e5 TV 2 SUMO: http://webtv.tv2.no/webtv/sumo/?treeId=3457\nwww.tv2.no/kollektivet", "title": "Kollektivet: Mens - Episode 1", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T14:06:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "49Kxvbo0onI", "description": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u306711\u670812\u65e5\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5897\u52a0\u3092\u6291\u5236\u3059\u308b\u653f\u7b56\u306e\u4e00\u74b0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u5973\u6027\u306e\u907f\u598a\u624b\u8853\u306713\u4eba\u304c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5973\u6027\u306f\u4e3b\u306b\u8ca7\u56f0\u5c64\u306e\u51fa\u8eab\u300283\u4eba\u4e2d50\u4eba\u304c\u5225\u306e\u533b\u7642\u6a5f\u95a2\u3078\u642c\u9001\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\u3000\n\u624b\u8853\u306f\u653f\u5e9c\u5098\u4e0b\u306e\u533b\u7642\u65bd\u8a2d\u3067\u884c\u308f\u308c\u305f\u304c\u3001\u533b\u5e2b\u306e\u624b\u8853\u304c\u305a\u3055\u3093\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3068\u307f\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u614b\u3068\u306f\u3002\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------\nTomoNews\uff08\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\uff09\u306f\u6700\u65b0\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u7d20\u65e9\u304f\uff23\uff27\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5316\u3057\u3001\u3088\u308a\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u304f\u767a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u767b\u9332\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/tomonewsjp?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u7121\u6599\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\nApple App Store:https://itunes.apple.com/app/tomonews/id633875353\nGoogle Play:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextmedia.gan\n\n\u30c8\u30e2\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\uff33\uff2e\uff33\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/TomoNewsJP\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/TomoNewsJP\n\n\u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b\u5148\nE-mail:info-jp@tomonews.net", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u3067\u305a\u3055\u3093\u306a\u96c6\u56e3\u907f\u598a\u624b\u8853\u3000\u5973\u602713\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1", "publishedDate": "2014-11-14T12:56:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "49L5WkNQndc", "description": "Another assignment for my school Media Arts class.

The case opened with the officers being asked for their name, address and date of birth. When both officers came back with the same address, (the police station) District Judge Zani piped up and demanded that their actual home address were provided as is the usual norm.\n\nCertainly those watching felt this was a clear indication that there was to be no special treatment for these officers who were standing trial. \n\nOn the matter of bail, I indicated I wouldn't be requesting remand for the officers but I would ask for conditions to be placed upon bail. I am concerned that as a result of the gravity of the offences there is a flight risk. The Judge denied my application, though was 'thankful' for my submissions.\n\nThe morning closed with the Judge bailing the officers and informing them they must attend;\n\nSouthwark Crown Court\n1 English Grounds \nLondon SE1 2HU\u200e\n020 7522 7200\n\nAs courts go, Southwark is a lovely court in a really nice part of London. Not far from Traitors gate so the location is pretty apt for events. Please put the date in your diary NOW and show your support on this day. Maybe combine it with a little sight seeing of London?\n\nThe hearing is 'Plea and Case Management hearing' so we will get to hear the Police officers plea to the following charges;\n\n- kidnap (max sentence life imprisonment)\n\n- false imprisonment (max sentence life imprisonment)\n\n- aggravated burglary (max sentence life imprisonment)\n\n- burglary (max sentence 14 yrs imprisonment)\n\n- affray (max sentence 3yrs imprisonment)\n\n- Misconduct in public office (max sentence life imprisonment) \n\nNeither officer looked as composed as when they arrived. Indeed their ought to be some pictures kicking about the net as they were followed down the street as they exited court by lots of press people. \n\nMetropolitan Police officers' solicitors\n\nIt is worthy of note that these officers have selected the same solicitors that helped Simon Harwood evade culpability in what was clearly a travesty of justice at the Ian Tomlinson trial. (unlawful killing returned at Inquest into Tomlinson's death)\n\nLike the Tomlinson case, video evidence will play a central part in the case. Unlike the Tomlinson case the Crown Prosecution does not have control of the prosecution. It is in my private hands, which seems the best and only sure way to bring the police before a jury.\n\nFor sure this case is going to be an interesting case of historic importance.....", "title": "COPS IN THE DOCK WESTMINSTER MAGISTRATES COURT LONDON PRIVATE PROSECUTION 15 AUG 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-08-18T12:12:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "49N8M2n8MOI", "description": "", "title": "28- GROUPS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES DE-ESCALATION TOOLS -- NATASHA-SCOTTISH TASER FORUM  2-4-2013", "publishedDate": "2013-02-26T21:18:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "49NqwfaiMt8", "description": "This shows the proper use of a scythe.

Saffron is one such flower which is obtained from the dried stigmas and the top portion of the style of plant saffron crocus. The botanical name of the flower is crocus sativus. \n\nMake sure you watch this video to the end: http://youtu.be/49YQCqmzB20\n\nThis plant belongs to the family Iridaceae.

In grows around the globe in places including Greece, Spain, Asia Minor, Persia, France and Greece. It is the most expensive spice of the world.\n\nSaffron extracts consist of volatile oil, a bitter principle by the name picrocrocin, polychrorite and a crystalline hydrocarbon. Polycrorite or crocin is a mixture of different glycosides. Saffron contains more than 150 alkaloids that make it highly useful for many purposes.\n\nSaffron has been found to lower dietary intake. The property can be useful for treating obese patients and for reducing weight. It increases the level of serotonin (a hormone) in brain which inhibits compulsive eating.

So what are they? Well let me explain.\n\nWhen you take a photo on a digital camera it shoots a Raw file which is not an image file format at all. It's a data file containing everything needed to create an image file from, kinda like a recipe.\n\nIf you're set to shoot jpeg then the camera's processor looks at the data and makes the jpeg file from it and throws the raw file away. The same things happens when you shoot in Tiff mode - it creates the tiff from the raw then deletes the raw. \n\nSo what are the benefits? Jpegs are very compressed and small so the are a convenient image file format to use for most things. The downside is that they degrade each time you save them so if you're working in an image editor and save as you work you're actually making the image fall apart.\n\nTiff files are much more stable than jpegs but they're much bigger file sizes.\n\nIf you shoot on Raw mode only then the camera doesn't process the image at all it just keeps it. You then have to download it to your computer and use raw file processing software like Lightroom or Photoshop to make the jpeg image yourself. \n\nBecause there's so much more data in a RAW (http://www.photographycourses.biz/image_file_formats.html) you can make a better quality image file because unlike the camera - you have a brain and can make the finished image look the way you want it to. Not the way the camera thinks it should be.\n\nMike Browne", "title": "Image File Formats Explained", "publishedDate": "2012-10-23T15:58:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "49_u-pXwx7g", "description": "Types of Research & Research Designs -- Rey Ty Qualitative Quantitative Exploratory Descriptive Explanatory Evaluation", "title": "Types of Research & Research Designs -- Rey Ty", "publishedDate": "2009-06-16T18:16:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "49aYUTbFdjo", "description": "http://tinyurl.com/All-Effects-of-Statins -

The fish are simply doing what they have been doing for millions of years... jumping.

Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six to seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the Coscoroba Swan, although this species is no longer considered related to the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though 'divorce' does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.\nThe swans are the largest members of the duck family Anatidae, and are among the largest flying birds. The largest species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can reach length of over 1.5 m (60 inches) and weigh over 15 kg (33 pounds). Their wingspans can be almost 3 m (10 ft). Compared to the closely related geese they are much larger in size and have proportionally larger feet and necks.[2] They also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill in adults. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males are generally bigger and heavier than females.\nSwans feed in the water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of aquatic animals. In the water food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants.\nFor regular updates on the latest happenings kindly subscribe www.youtube.com/AnimalsLoveLife", "title": "Group Of Swan In Water", "publishedDate": "2011-09-07T18:34:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "49hF3VZqOuM", "description": "COLEGIO SAN AGUSTIN-GR 4", "title": "THE AUGUSTINIAN JUBILATION 2008 PART 3", "publishedDate": "2008-02-15T17:02:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "49heISBZzOM", "description": "Yep, the assignment was recreate one of three certain Shakespeare scenes.

No casualty was reported immediately. Local authorities and the company rushed fire tenders to douse the fire. Officials said the fire was reported around afternoon at one of IOC's five petrol storage tanks at the Hazira depot. The tank had almost 5,000 kilolitre of petrol, half of its capacity, when it caught fire.\n\nThis is the second major fire at IOC storage depots since 2009. On October 29, 2009, a fire broke out at its Jaipur terminal which was blamed on non-observance of normal safety procedures. The Jaipur depot fire raged for 11 days, killed 11 people and resulted in losses worth Rs. 280 crore. Senior IOC officials have rushed to Hazira to supervise operations and an inquiry has been ordered to ascertain its causes.\nHazira is a so-called 'white-oil terminal', housing a tank farm to store petrol and diesel. It has five petrol storage tanks and four diesel tanks. While local administration rushed fire brigade personnel from Surat and nearby cities, IOC has sent fire tenders from its Koyali refinery to douse the fire.\n\"The fire has been isolated,\" a company official said. \"A high-level team has been constituted to investigate the cause of the fire but our first priority is to put out the fire...efforts are on at war footing.\"\nSenior team from Mumbai office too are rushing to the site of accident.", "title": "India :  Major fire at Indian Oil Corporation's storage", "publishedDate": "2013-01-05T15:38:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "49jEo04IRXo", "description": "Libyan women gather in Martyrs Square, formerly known as Green square, to celebrate Gaddafi's fall", "title": "Libyan women gather in Martyrs Square", "publishedDate": "2011-09-03T07:48:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "49k7dPZPYMY", "description": "The Ultimate Fighter 19 elimination fight between Anton Burzen and Cody Mumma, uncut and uninterrupted.", "title": "TUF 19: Elimination Fight Anton Berzin vs Cody Mumma", "publishedDate": "2014-05-28T06:44:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "49kgbE5kduY", "description": "Watch video from the Atlanta Fulton County Zoo's \"Panda Cam.\" The zoo captured footage showing the progress of twin newborn giant pandas, the first twin panda cubs born in the U.S. in over 25 years.

Now in addition to having both the inside and outside edges of your foot you also don't want to forget to use sometimes the top of your feet for what are called toe hooks and even the heel of your foot for what are called heel hooks. \n\nOne critical part of using both the toe and the heel is remembering to really engage your core muscles. A lot of what makes heel hooks and toe hooks work is being able to keep your body stable by engaging those abdominals and really tightening your core to keep that heel or that toe in place. \n\nSo, right now I'll demonstrate what a toe hook would look like. In that example I was using the toe hook to take the weight off of my right hand, freeing that hand, allowing me to make that next move. One more example of a toe hook will also be when you have featurees like this, large climbing holds, there isn't really a space for me to be pressing down on. So, I can use a toe hook along with that coordination of my core muscles to keep my body in place. So when I'm on the wall I can put my toe behind that hold keeping me in place. \n\nFor a heel hook in this position here I'll do similar to what I just did with my right toe, but now I'm going to use my left heel.\n\nSo, using that heel hook and the toe hook are often times dictated by the position that your body's in. In both of those scenarios I wasn't able to get a toe on, and I was only able to use my heel and/or the back side, that toe hook position.\n\nAnother example of using a heel hook on terrain that's not quite as steep would even be a situation over here, where planting my heel will allow me to take a lot of weight. I'm going to remember to be engaging my core, really pulling in on that heel, allowing me to take a lot of that weight and continue to move through. \n\nSo, really important, once you put that heel on engage those stomach muscles. That's going to help it stay in place.\n\nAnd that's some examples of how to use heel hooks and toe hooks.", "title": "How to Use Heel & Toe Hooks | Rock Climbing", "publishedDate": "2013-08-26T09:42:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "49vGlSyf05A", "description": "Buy \"Beside You\" on iTunes: http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=815666880\nSigned CDs of \"The Disappearance of the Girl\", featuring \"Beside You\", are available here: http://www.musicglue.com/phildel/\n\nBeside You (Lyrics)\n \nEven if you were upside-down,\nI would be beside you,\nAnd your world were a strange thing found,\nI would be beside you,\nIn my symbolised world\nI'm a beautiful girl,\nIn my house on the hill\nThere is room for you still\n \nWhen there's nothing but dark and sound,\nI will be beside you,\nWhen there's nothing but the long way 'round,\nI will be beside you,\n \nIn my simplified world,\nWe're a boy and a girl,\nIn my house on the hill\nThere is room for you still,\n \nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go,\nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go...\n \nIn my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl,\nIn my house on the hill there is room for you still.\n \nWhen there's nothing but roaring sound,\nI will be beside you,\nWhen there's nothing but the long drop down,\nI will be beside you,\nWhen your fears are a swarm in the hive of your mind,\nWhen the tears of your love and your loss are entwined...\n \nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go,\nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go...\n \nIn my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl,\nIn my house on the hill there is room for you still,\n \nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go,\nI'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go.", "title": "Phildel - Beside You - The Disappearance of the Girl", "publishedDate": "2013-02-09T22:51:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "49vMSA_FBrQ", "description": "Piosenka dla Mamy kt\u00f3r\u0105 bardzo Kocham.

Mini Postmasters fit excavators from 1.5 to 3 tonnes and the use of small machines permitted faster, safer and more precise placement than previously achieved. Safety is significantly improved and noise levels reduced.\n\nThe Mini Postmaster can be installed on excavators from 1.5 tonne upwards; but as this excavator was small it was able to fit in between the rows making installation much quicker. \n\nThe Solar south west team also commented on many other advantages of the Mini Postmaster from the noise level and swift rate of installation to accuracy of level/depth/straightness of the posts. \nThe Autoguide Mini Postmaster fence post driver is a twin shaft vibrator for driving all types of fencing posts.

In this top 10 list, we will show you few real-world animals have powers that would make even Superman jealous.\n\"10 Real-Life Animal 'Superpowers'\"Top 10 Ridiculous Superhero Powers\"Top 10 Superhero Movies\"Top 10 Ridiculous Power Rangers Monsters\"Top 10 Most Powerful Marvel Female SuperHeroes\"Top 10 Hilarious Superpowers\"Top 10 Superhero Movie Weapons\"\n\n10- With this ability, it can hunt without the help of its eyes, nose and ears \u2013 just like a dragon toothless from DreamWorks \u201chow to train your dragon\u201d.\n9- Gecko are great wall climbers or we say mighty which can climb polished glass walls a meter per second and can even cling in the walls with just a single toe.\n8- It is the salamander that is not only capable of growing back its limb and tails but also its heart and brains.\n7- The mimic octopus is a species of octopus capable of impersonating other sea creatures.\nMost octopuses are notable for being able to change their skin color and texture in order to blend in with their environment, such as algae-encrusted rock and nearby coral through pigment sacs known as chromatophores.\n\n6- Upon reading this list, you might think about this species to be on the list. We all know this guy has special organs (3 abdominal pairs of organs that produce electricity: the main organ, the Hunter\u2019s organ, and the Sach\u2019s organ.) with cells that can generate small about of electricity or like creating a 600 volts to power 60 watts bulbs enough to kill a human being.\n5 strength and muscle power match, Dung Beetle is one of my bet. It can pull 1, 141 times its own body weight which is comparable to a 200 lb (90 kg) man pulling 12 school buses at once. I could say that hulk is real in animal kingdom.\n4 - Peacock Mantis Shrimp is a large mantis shrimp native to the Indo-Pacific from Guam to East Africa. In the saltwater aquarium TRADE, it is both prized for its attractiveness and considered by others to be a dangerous pest.\nThis shrimp has a super punch that punches at a speed of over 50 ft (15 m) per second which of course the fastest punch on the record\n3- The snapping or pistol shrimp grows to only 1\u20132 inches (3\u20135 cm) long. It is distinctive for its remarkably disproportionate large claw, larger than half the shrimp\u2019s body. The claw can be on either arm of the body, and unlike most shrimp claws does not have typical pincers at the end. Rather, it has a pistol-like feature made of two parts.\nit can also create a bubble that has a temperate almost as hot as the sun \u2013 at 8,540 degrees Fahrenheit (4726.85 degrees Celsius).\n2- Now, this animal has the ability that I wish I had for real. It can literally sprays toxic fluid at predator from its special grand. The specific fluid can reach up to 100 \u00b0C which is discharge with a bang.\n1- Hydrozoa or hydrozoans are a taxonomic class of individually very small, predatory animals, some solitary and some colonial, most living in salt water. The colonies of the colonial species can be large, and in some cases the specialized individual animals cannot survive outside the colony.\nTheir most fascinating ability is to revert back to its younger form. Hydrozoans can repeat the process essentially like it can live forever.", "title": "10 Superpowers Animals", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T06:43:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4A4T87s4n3k", "description": "Watch the longer - better - version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrUlHTW5Zo\nThis video shows how to set up an external canister filter but the same process applies for all filters.

The development is on a large brownfield site, part of which was once the location of the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition; the initial site clearance demolished the set of halls still remaining from the exhibition (their cheap-to-build, white-painted blank facades are said to be the origin of the name \"White City\"). Much of the site was in use as a railway depot excavated to a lower level and built over.\n\nThe centre is noted for its size: it has a retail floor area of 150,000m\u00b2 (1.615m ft\u00b2), the equivalent of about 30 football pitches.

It is still widely used as a term of endearment for the French infantry of World War I. The word carries the sense of the infantryman's typically rustic, agricultural background. Beards and bushy moustaches were often worn. The poilu was particularly known for his love of pinard, his ration of cheap wine.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nI don\u00b4t own the rights for the music in this video.\nMusic: \"Poverty\" from the game \"Victoria 2\"", "title": "Scorpio Models \"Poilu\" in 75mm scale", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T07:34:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AClDkXiLbw", "description": "At least 25 different proteins have been shown to cause amyloidosis, and the underlying pathogenesis of each subtype of amyloidosis is unique.

First, the good news is it looks like the rumors about Beyonce\u2019s new music were, mostly, true because it\u2019s CONFIRMED that Queen B is releasing at least TWO brand new songs. REJOICE! And the bad news? None of them are the rumored collabs with Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, and Nicki Minaj. Honestly, I\u2019m not really that sad \u2013 Beyonce solo is more than enough for me. But I\u2019m obsessed so maybe that\u2019s just me. \nOn Monday rumors were swirling that Beyonce was ready to release ANOTHER surprise album when a document leaked that appeared to confirm a track list for a possible part two of her self-titled album that dropped late last year. However, we now know that the self-titled album is getting a re-release with TWO new songs and a few new remixes of the previous songs. One that I\u2019m personally really excited about is the \u201cBlow\u201d remix with Pharrell. Yeah, that\u2019s going to be awesome.\nBeyonce\u2019s record label confirmed that the Beyonc\u00e9 Platinum Edition Box will drop on November 24, and will feature two new songs titled \u201c7/11\u201d and \u201cRing Off.\u201d In addition to that, the box set will include a DVD of her Mrs. Carter Show world tour AND a mini calendar. Um, santa are you listening\u2026because you know what will be on my wish list this Holiday season.\nWhile this news is SUPER exciting, I have to admit I\u2019m a little bummed that the potential collabs didn\u2019t actually turn out to be true. Let\u2019s just hope that was a COMPLETE rumor, and not something that Beyonce might be withholding from us all because it got leaked. Beyonce can be very tricky about that stuff, so that could be an option. Just something to think about.\nAlright, what say YOU about this Beyonce news? Are you happy for new music? Or bummed because it wasn\u2019t what people were expecting?

For reasons of economy and quality, many modern chewing gums use rubber instead of chicle. Chicle is nonetheless still the base of choice for some regional markets, such as in Japan.\n\nChewing gum is a type of candy, in various forms has existed since at least the Neolithic period. 5,000 year old chewing gum with tooth imprints, made of birch bark tar, has been found in Kierikki, Yli-Ii, Finland. The bark tar of which the gums were made is believed to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal advantages.[1] The ancient Aztecs used chicle as a base for making a gum-like substance. Women in particular used this gum as a mouth freshener.\n\nForms of chewing gums were also used in Ancient Greece. The Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree.[2] Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.\n\nThe American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees.The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. William Semple filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304, on December 28, 1869.\n\nModern chewing gum was first developed in the 1860s when chicle was exported from Mexico for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum it soon dominated the market. Chicle gum, and gum made from similar latexes, had a smoother and softer texture and held flavor better. Most chewing gum companies have since switched to synthetic gum bases because of their low price and availability. According to their website, Glee Gum is the last gum manufacturer in the United States to produce gum using all-natural chicle, along with Peppersmith in the UK\nBubblegum is a type of elastic chewing gum, designed to blow a bubble out of the mouth. Bubblegum is available in many different colors and flavors. The most common flavor, known simply as \"bubblegum\" is traditionally colored a light shade of pink and flavored with oil of wintergreen.\nIn 1928, bubble gum was invented by Walter E. Diemer. Walter was working as an accountant for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company in Philadelphia. In his spare time, he played around with new gum recipes. The gum he invented was less sticky than regular chewing gum and it stretched more easily. He sold his gum under the name dubble bubble in 1928. Bubble gum is pink because it was the only food dye Diemer had on hand at the time.", "title": "ELECTRIC GUMS!!!!!", "publishedDate": "2010-07-13T14:59:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ARU2C-_pSM", "description": "Follow filmmaker Walter Todd over 36 deadly hours as he exploits friends and family during a NYE party, exposing their darkest secrets and perversions.

At age eight, tragedy struck when Arno\u2019s father was mysteriously killed, leaving the young boy scarred and orphaned. He\u2019s adopted by Francois De La Serre, head of the Templars, a long-standing organization seeking to create a \u201cperfect world\u201d. Arno, unaware of his adopted family\u2019s allegiance, was raised by Francois and his daughter, Elise. The children became fast friends, often getting into trouble because of Elise\u2019s adventurous personality. Unbeknownst to them at this time, they were training to be part of the Templars. However, Francois is soon murdered with Arno framed as the culprit.\n\nLeft to wonder why his parental figures keep dying, Arno decided to join the Assassin Brotherhood to find answers. By 1789, Arno has now achieved the rank Master Assassin, but remains wary of the Brotherhood and their sworn enemy, the Templars. He will soon realize that the deaths of his loved ones are not only connected, but may be inextricably tied to the French Revolution, a time of great social and political upheaval and sung-through musicals. Arno must now encounter historical figures, his now adversary and love interest, Elise, and the uncertain state of his home country to seek redemption.

Depuis dimanche soir, l'extr\u00e8me-droite d\u00e9tient en effet d\u00e9sormais 14 communes. \u00c0 savoir B\u00e9ziers, Fr\u00e9jus, Hayange, Cogolin, Beaucaire, Villers-Cotter\u00eats, Le Luc, Le Pontet, Mantes-la-Ville, le 7e secteur de Marseille et H\u00e9nin-Beaumont pour le Front National, mais aussi trois villes pour La Ligue du Sud : Camaret-sur-Aigues, Orange et Boll\u00e8ne. \nPr\u00e9f\u00e9rence nationale: 1995, c'\u00e9tait l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 le FN avait fait \u00e9lire trois maires, \u00e0 Toulon, Marignane (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) et Orange (Vaucluse), auxquelles Vitrolles (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne) s'\u00e9tait ajout\u00e9e en 1997.\nMais le parti d'extr\u00eame droite r\u00e9ussira-t-il \u00e0 faire oublier des exp\u00e9riences, dans leur ensemble, calamiteuses ?\nLe tronc commun des gestions FN se d\u00e9cline en trois points : \u00ab La politique s\u00e9curitaire, des policiers municipaux plus importants que la moyenne ou un certain folklorisme dans la politique de la culture (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'ils ont mis en avant le patrimoine r\u00e9gional et non fran\u00e7ais de ces communes) \u00bb, commentait Dominique Sitache en juin 2012 sur Atlantico.Le seul qui s'en sort, c'est Jacques Bompard, en sachant que c'est celui qui a pratiqu\u00e9 la gestion communale la plus ordinaire.\nOrange, le syst\u00e8me Bompard:Daniel Simonpri\u00e9ni, maire de Marignane de 1995 \u00e0 2002.

She has a team of 35 people to help her keep her course and giver her food and water.\n\n\nOn her 2012 attempt, Diana Nyad's face swelled up after being stung by jellyfish\nDuring her last attempt in August 2012, she had to be pulled out of the water after 41 hours when a squall and repeated stings by poisonous jellyfish made it impossible for her to continue.\n\nShe first tried to complete the crossing in 1978 with a shark cage.\n\nA second attempt - without a cage - in 2011 had to be called off because of shoulder pain and an asthma attack. Later the same year, jellyfish stings ended her third bid at the crossing.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Cuba on Friday she said this would be her last attempt.\n\n\"It's been thrilling for me - it was 35 years ago, and it still is - to do something no-one else has done. It's all been worthwhile,\" she said.\n\n\"But this time if I don't make it, I will stand tall and I say: 'I have nothing more to bring'.\"\n\nIn June, Australian endurance swimmer Chloe McCardle tried to make the crossing without a shark cage but had to give up after also being stung by jellyfish.", "title": "US swimmer Diana Nyad tries to cross Florida Straits", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T22:02:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AX9AcPOldc", "description": "Disclaim's new Denazification taken from the Molotov Moshers-EP.", "title": "Disclaim -  Molotov Moshers - Denazification", "publishedDate": "2013-09-08T12:25:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AXD499LmZc", "description": "", "title": "VOCABULARY IN 20 LANGUAGES = Lutetium", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05T10:01:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AXIjFvj4Ag", "description": "Use playlist to watch easily.

The three little pieces by Purcell are Hornpipe, A New Ground, and Air.  The Epinette \u00e0 l'octave was quite popular in the 1670's. This one's an exact replica of the one surviving from the hands of Jean Denis, Paris maker from 1677. The standard 50-note GG/BB to c3 compass is enclosed in a rectangular case of black walnut. The keyboard is not removable but built into the bottom. Each key lever must be removed individually. The jacks are quite short and need lead weight to return. It is tuned a minor seventh above modern pitch or an octave above a=392. The accidentals of solid bone were made by Owen Daly. The spinet was made by Jack Peters in Seattle. Note from the performer: This is an instrument on which, for once, NOT having long fingers could be an advantage! The viewer will note the small size of the keys, and some will be aware of my struggle not to play on the cracks a good part of the time. This instrument, in its day, was probably a lady's instrument, and such small spinets were likely relegated to the boudoir and not to the public music room.", "title": "Henry Purcell:  Three little pieces, played on replica 1677 Epinette \u00e0 l'octave of Jean Denis, played by Ryan Layne Whitney", "publishedDate": "2008-10-05T02:18:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AdhHa0_t_s", "description": "Music used:\n''Gang Plank Galleon'' from ''Donkey Kong Country''", "title": "Soldier thinks the sentry is american", "publishedDate": "2010-11-07T20:16:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Ae8d-y42Uo", "description": "", "title": "paclitaxel (Taxol).mov", "publishedDate": "2013-11-19T15:01:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4AeMznr669U", "description": "NOAH - AB 3.

Mit NOAH ist ihnen ein imposantes Epos gelungen, das durch seine Vielfalt an CGI-Neusch\u00f6pfungen und Special Effects zu einem bildgewaltigen, kraftvollen und einmaligen Kinoerlebnis wird.

In animals, meiosis produces gametes like sperm and egg cells, while in other organisms like fungi it generates spores. Meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome\u2014one from the organism's mother and one from its father\u2014and produces four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosome. Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA, ensuring that offspring are genetically distinct from either parent. This gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populations, which enables them to adapt during the course of evolution.\n\nBefore meiosis, the cell's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication. This leaves the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome, called homologs, composed of two exact copies called sister chromatids and attached at the centromere region. In the beginning of meiosis, the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each other. Then they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination, leading to crossovers of DNA from the maternal version of the chromosome to the paternal version and vice versa. Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator. Then the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell. As the chromosomes move away from the center, the cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids. After the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells, a second round of cell division occurs. There, meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cells. Upon fertilization, for example when a sperm enters an egg cell, two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse. The gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute half to the set of chromosomes that make up the new offsping's genome.\n\nMeiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis, a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cells. In all plants, and in many protists, meiosis results in the formation of spores, haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization. Some eukaryotes, like Bdelloid rotifers, have lost the ability to carry out meiosis and have acquired the ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis. Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria, which reproduce via asexual processes such as binary fission.", "title": "meiosis", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T20:52:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4B0DDpfBZ_Y", "description": "Russia and the world are starting lift-off toward the 2018 FIFA World Cup\u2122.

This cell degeneration causes problems with movement, balance and other autonomic functions of the body such as bladder control or blood pressure regulation.\nThe cause of MSA is unknown and no specific risk factors have been identified\nAround 55% of cases occur in men, with typical age of ONSET IN THE LATE 50S TO EARLY 60S\nMSA is characterized by a combination of the following, which can be present in any combination:\n\u2022 AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION\n\u2022 PARKINSONISM (muscle rigidity +/ tremor and slow movement)\n\u2022 ATAXIA (Poor coordination / unsteady walking)\nWhen AUTONOMIC FAILURE PREDOMINATES, the term SHY-DRAGER SYNDROME is sometimes used, although this term is no longer current, given the terminology changes which are explained below.[7] This syndrome was named after Dr Milton Shy and Dr. Glenn Dragger, who identified it in 1960, but the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology redefined it as multiple system atrophy with autonomic phenomena in 1996\nA variant with combined features of MSA and Lewy body dementia may also exist\nINITIAL PRESENTATION\nThe most common first sign of MSA is the appearance of an \"a kinetic-rigid syndrome\" (i.e. SLOWNESS OF INITIATION OF MOVEMENT RESEMBLING PARKINSON'S DISEASE) found in 62% at first presentation.\nOther common signs at onset include problems with balance (cerebellar ataxia) found in 22% at first presentation, followed by GENITO-URINARY PROBLEMS (9%).\nFor men, the first sign can be erectile dysfunction (inability to achieve or sustain an erection).\nBoth men and women often experience problems with their bladders including urgency, frequency, incomplete bladder emptying or an inability to pass urine (retention). About 1 in 5 MSA patients will suffer a fall in their first year of disease.\nThese common first signs are the same as those of sub-acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency: Patients present with weakness of legs, arms, trunk, tingling and numbness that progressively worsens. Vision changes and change of mental state may also be present.\nBilateral spastic paresis may develop and pressure, vibration and touch sense are diminished. A positive Babinski sign may be seen.\nProlonged deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to irreversible nervous system damage Vitamin B12 should be tested directly; it cannot be ruled out by a complete blood count.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring.

Just like a crab or a shrimp but this species of Isopod crustacean is called \"Wood lice\". Not the friendliest sounding name but they are a harmless adaptable little species feeding on decaying plant matter. Isopods are a success story and there are over 4000 species worldwide. They have adapted to take advantage of the moisture under logs, leaves and compost piles allowing them to no longer need to live underwater like the rest of their family. They are a great species avoiding predators from birds to Centipedes and the infamous Woodlice Spider.

Somerset, in particular, has a custom of wassailing the apple trees to produce a fruitful crop of apples for cider-making. Each year on the 17th of January (old \"Twelfth Night\") the people of Somerset wassail their apple trees by placing toast (dipped in cider) into the branches of the tree and pouring a libation of cider round the rood of the tree for the good spirits, then firing shotguns into the branches of the tree to dive away the bad spirits and so ensure a fine crop of cider apples in the summer ahead. Yes, it still happens, even in the twenty-first century. This particular Somerset Wassail is of unknown origin, but was collected by Cecil Sharp.\nArtisan come from Yorkshire, high on the edge of the English Pennines. Formed in 1984, Hilary Spencer, Jacey Bedford and  Brian Bedford toured the world with their music for many years, performing in the UK, Europe, Canada, Australia and the USA. When they weren't singing carols Brian wrote most of the songs - witty, elegant and engaging songs. Their voices blend beautifully and, luckily, they own a shared sense of humour. Retiring from touring in November 2005, people seem to be surprised that they are all still very good friends.  \nAnother recording 'Sussex Carol' from 'Christmas Has Come In' by Artisan is also on this channel. http://www.bluedotmusic.net\nVideo produced by Allcast for blue dot music\nhttp://www.allcast.co.uk\n\u00a92009 blue dot music\nAll Worldwide Rights Reserved.", "title": "Christmas ~ Somerset Wassail ~ Happy Holidays ~ Artisan", "publishedDate": "2009-12-01T01:40:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4B7vShaate0", "description": "Justin Bieber is now bragging to friends about taking Selena Gomez's virginity according to a new report.

Plus, most of these products are packed with toxins such as coal tars, fluorides, aspartame, aluminum and benzene. \n\nIf you want whiter teeth without ingesting harmful carcinogens then try oil pulling. \n\nWhat is oil pulling?\n\nOil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic ritual where you swish oil (teaspoon of sesame oil or sunflower oil) around in your mouth for about 20 minutes and then spit it out. At first you have to get used to swishing around oil for 20 minutes but over-time you get will get more comfortable.\n \nOil pulling goes beyond teeth whitening.  According to Dr. Karach, M.D., \"oil pulling treats headaches, bronchitis, tooth pain, eczema, ulcers, and much more.\" \n\nDr. Bruce Fife, whose written an entire book on oil pulling, says the oil acts like a cleanser.\n\n\"When you put it in your mouth and work it around your teeth and gums it \"pulls\" out bacteria and other debris. As simple as it is, oil pulling has a very powerful detoxifying effect. Our mouths are the home to billions of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other parasites and their toxins. Candida and Streptococcus are common residents in our mouths. It is these types of germs and their toxic waste products that cause gum disease and tooth decay and contribute to many other health problems including arthritis and heart disease. Our immune system is constantly fighting these troublemakers. If our immune system becomes overloaded or burdened by excessive stress, poor diet, environmental toxins and such, these organisms can spread throughout the body causing secondary infections and chronic inflammation, leading to any number of health problems.\"\n\nOil pulling (best to do it before breakfast) this  is incredibly effective for:\n\nPeace :)\n\nBrightening & whitening teeth\nHealthier gums\nRemoval of mucus\nBoosting the immune system\nPreventing bad breath\nIncreasing energy\nHaving a clearer mind\nDecreasing headaches\nClearing the sinuses\nAlleviating allergies\nBetter sleep\nMore clearer skin\nRegulating menstrual cycles\nDecreasing inflammation\nImproving the lymphatic system\nImproving PMS symptoms\n \n\nHow to oil pull:\n\nDrink 1 cup of water on an empty stomach (best to do it before breakfast).\nUse 1-3 teaspoon of organic, cold-pressed vegetable oil (sesame oil is shown to work best) in your mouth \nSwish through your mouth for 20 minutes while you're busy doing something else like checking your emails. \n After 10-15 minutes the oil will become thin and white as it emulsifies with your saliva.\nSpit into trash, compost or outside in the grass (just not in the sink - we don't want to clog the pipes).\nSwish water through your mouth to rinse.\n \n\nThere's a lot more you can do with sesame oil besides oil pulling. Here are some other sesame oil benefits:\n \nBed time gum massage:\n\nAyurveda recommends massaging the gums with sesame oil before going to bed to prevent or help receding gums. For a quick night time boost to your oral health, you could pour a little oil onto the bristles of an electric toothbrush and then massage around your gums and over the surface of your teeth. For maximum benefit don't rinse afterwards, just leave the oil residue in your mouth to work while you rest. It's not unpleasant and makes your mouth feel very clean.\n\nSesame oil works as a great natural lip salve too, dip your finger into a small amount and rub it gently into your lips morning and night to protect them from chapping.\n\nWhile the oil's out why not spend a couple more minutes really looking after yourself?\n\nThe sesame oil de-stress routine:\n\nTo ease anxiety and improve sleep pour a little oil into the palm of your hand and massage into your forehead and temples. Rubbing warm sesame oil into the area between your eyebrows in slow gentle circles is particularly good for calming your mind and improving the quality of sleep.\n\nFinally use a little more oil and massage it into your feet. Work up and down the instep to release tension from your spine, and across the soles of your feet to relax tension and help you feel grounded as you settle down to rest.\n\nIf you're worried about getting oil on your bed linen you could sleep with cotton socks on which will also help keep your feet warm and draw tension from your head down into your lower body.\n\n \n\nNow it's your turn.\n\nTry it out and let us know what you think!\n\n \n\n\nDrew Canole\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.oilpulling.com/\n\nhttp://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4896/The-Single-Most-Effective-Ayurvedic-Practice-for-Your-Mouth.html\n\nhttp://thehealthylivinglounge.com/2009/05/25/how-to-get-shiny-teeth-and-healthy-gums-with-oil-pulling/", "title": "WHAT IS OIL PULLING - MORE ENERGY - CLEARER MIND - DECREASE HEADACHES", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T23:33:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BEGx0jJeZQ", "description": "Editado por http://www.twitter.com/davisoeditando\n\nSugerido por http://twitter.com/@JohnnyMenezes\n\nV\u00eddeo original:\nhttp://www.naosalvo.com.br/aprenda-a-fazer-firulas-com-o-mestre-das-facas/", "title": "Faca Fruit AK-47 Ninja", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T03:10:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BEZUAjZSZE", "description": "Here is a practice video for the Beef Loin and Rib cuts.

In 1636, a group of English settlers led by the Reverend Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts and formed a colony here. The settlers made peace with the local Algonquin Indians, who called the town Saukiog, and renamed it after Hertford, England. \n\nEarly in its existence Hartford made a significant contribution to the burgeoning society. The Fundamental Orders adopted by the colony in 1639, was the first document in history to establish a government by the consent of the people. The pattern was followed by the framers of the United States Constitution, giving Connecticut its nickname, \"The Constitution State.\" \n\nEvolving from an early agricultural economy, Hartford grew into an important trading center on the Connecticut River. Molasses, spices, coffee and rum were distributed from warehouses in the city's thriving merchant district. Ships set sail from Hartford to England, the West Indies and the Far East. Merchants were concerned about risks to this thriving trade, with fires, pirates, storms and accidents always a threat. \n\nThe insurance industry was created when groups of merchants began to share these risks. The practice was formalized with the creation of the Hartford Fire Insurance Group in 1810. Our nation's oldest insurance company still operates in the city as the Hartford Insurance Company. Hartford became the home of many of the nation's largest insurance companies, such as Aetna and Travelers, and is known today as the Insurance Capital of the World. \n\nPioneering manufacturers like Samuel Colt also called Hartford home. Colt's experiments with interchangeable parts created the basis for today's assembly line manufacturing methods. New techniques employed in his firearms factory made mass production possible and laid the groundwork for Hartford's pre-eminence in the area of precision manufacturing.\n\nShaped by the social and economic forces which gave rise to industrial growth in America, Hartford grew and prospered as successive waves of immigrants came to work, build and settle in the community. This ethnic and cultural diversity continues to be a prominent part of Hartford's heritage and one of our cities greatest assets. \n\nHartford also became an important cultural and communications center. The Hartford Courant, founded in 1764, is the country's oldest continuously published newspaper. The nations oldest public art museum, the Wadsworth Athenaeum, was founded in 1844. Supported by prominent benefactors like J.P. Morgan, the museum grew to become one of the top ten art museums in the country. Authors like Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe were drawn to the area, because, as Twain said \"of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see, this is the chief.\"", "title": "Hartford, Connecticut", "publishedDate": "2011-05-19T13:02:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BJrLXLqBlE", "description": "Rough and Ready Lumber announced on Wednesday that they are closing its lumber mill in Cave Junction.

There has been some research done on wild carrot seeds mostly in other countries, the results of those experiments have been encouraging. The Chinese view QAL as a promising post-coital agent, \"recent evidence suggests that terpenoids in the seed block crucial progesterone synthesis in pregnant animals.\" 1 When asked about the contraceptive effects of wild carrot, some herbalists have described it as having the effect of making the uterus \"slippery\" so the egg is unable to implant.\n\nNote: post-coital means - after sexual intercourse where the penis has entered the vagina.\"\n\nOREGON GRAPES:\nTherapeutic Uses, Benefits and Claims of Oregon Grape\n\nLike the barberry Oregon grape contains the alkaloids berberine, berbamine, canadine and hydrastine. It's believed that these alkaloids inhibit the ability of bacteria, such as E. coli, to attach to human cells and thus prevent the spread of infection.\nOregon Grape\nThe Medicinal Herb Oregon Grape\n(Berberis aquifolium)\nThere is some evidence that as an ointment Oregon grape may alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis. It is also used in small doses to treat diarrhea and in larger doses to treat constipation.\nOne of the primary actions of this herb is improvement of blood flow to the liver. It also stimulates intestinal secretions and bile flow. It's sometimes used in the treatment of jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis and general digestive problems.\nLaboratory tests have shown that Oregon grape can kill or suppress the growth of candida and other fungal infections, staphylococcus, streptococcus, E. coli, Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia lamblia, Vibrio cholerae and other harmful microbes. Animal studies have indicated that it may enhance the performance of some antibiotics. No results from clinical trials are available at this time.\nA tincture of the herb is used traditionally as both oral and topical herbal remedy to treat eczema, acne, conjunctivitis and herpes. Additional historical and traditional uses include the treatment of gall bladder disease, hemorrhages and a few forms of cancer.\nNative American tribes used Mahonia aquifolium as a treatment for fungal infections, skin problems and dysentery. These early Americans were aware of the herb's anti-inflammatory properties.\nIt is most thoroughly researched in the treatment of skin irritations and disorders, but studies of the effectiveness of the herb as a treatment for fungal infections, acne and eczema are very preliminary and inconclusive.\nOregon grape shows promise as a treatment for auto immune diseases of the skin, but there are currently no conclusive clinical results. An herbalist or physician can provide advice on whether this treatment is suitable for an individual patient.\nIn addition to berberine and other alkaloids found in barberry and goldenseal, Mahonia aquifolium contains phytochemicals, including jatrorrhizine, hydrastine, columbamine, tetrahydroberberine, tannins and oxyacanthine. Barberry contains more nutrients and vitamins, but it is thought that both barberry and Oregon grape help boost the immune system and create a barrier to bacteria in the lining of the intestines and the mucus membrane\n\n(Just some snippets of info I pulled off a couple websites.

Pictured and described by Signaller Ellis Silas, a Soldier Artist serving with the Australian Expeditionary Force. Forewords by Sir Ian Hamilton ... and Sir William Birdwood ...\n\nLondon, The British-Australasian, 1916.\n\nLarge oblong octavo, [88] pages (first and last pages blank) with a frontispiece portrait of the author and 40 full-page illustrations.\n\nEarly cloth (recently rebacked in calf) with the original two-colour pictorial front wrapper (slightly marked) mounted on the front board; first page a little marked, with one tiny corner piece missing; one illustration torn across the top corner (with an old but neat tissue-paper repair on the verso); a very good copy.\n\nEllis Luciano Silas (1885-1972), born in London, was the son of an artist and designer. He studied under Walter Sickert in his father's studio. In 1907, he came to Australia where he settled in Perth. In 1914, Silas joined the 16th Battalion, which was thrown into action after dark on 25 April 1915 at Pope's Hill and Quinn's Post and a week later at the ominously named Bloody Angle. In two weeks there were 605 casualties, leaving only 9 officers and 298 other ranks. Silas was a signaller, a notoriously dangerous occupation, as the signaller had to send his semaphore signals standing. The 16th Battalion's historian, Captain Cyril Longmore, noted in The Old Sixteenth (1929) that by 3 May 'the signallers were reduced to almost an unworkable proposition'. Small wonder that after three weeks Silas was evacuated, suffering shell-shock. In this book Silas gives the reader his personal odyssey, with the first eight illustrations describing the voyage out and street scenes in Cairo. Most of the illustrations record his experience at Gallipoli, from the Landing on 25 April until his admission to hospital in Heliopolis three weeks later. His series of drawings, worked up from sketches on the spot, was published the following year with accompanying comments. Many of the drawings show something of what it was like to be fighting in three of the most deadly places, then being evacuated on the transport Galeka, the decks of which were lined with wounded. Silas was able to walk, and was on duty for the whole voyage, assisting those who could not. He collapsed as soon as he was put aboard the hospital train from Alexandria to Cairo and in the care of Indian hospital orderlies. This book was one of the first 'to record the war by an individual soldier, and one of the earliest first-hand accounts of the Gallipoli campaign' (Jonathan Wantrup). It quickly went into a second impression; both versions are rare. This copy is effectively the dedication copy, bearing the following inscription in Silas's flowing script: 'A Souvenir. To my dear and excellent commander Major Margolin under whom I had the honour of serving at Anzac April-May 1915. Signaller Ellis L. Silas. 4.12.1916'. Longmore also writes in glowing terms of Margolin, who went on to command the 14th and 16th Battalions; he was one of only a few Jewish officers in the AIF. It is difficult to imagine a more desirable copy of this important work.

A major question is how kMT plus-end assembly is spatially regulated. Kinesins attach to kMTs and move toward their plus ends. Upon arrival at plus ends, motors promote kMT shrinking. Longer kMTs have more motor binding sites than short kMTs, and so they accumulate more motors at their plus ends than short kMTs and grow poorly relative to short kMTs. Over time, kinetochores naturally sort into two groups, ready for anaphase.

Androgens, male hormones that are secreted in different amounts by both men and women, play an important role in most cases of acne. Androgens stimulate the hormone-sensitive sebaceous glands, which produce oil, known as sebum. Sebum, in turn, has been called \"the fuel that feeds the flame of acne.\"\n\nGenetics also seem to play a role. There are some families in which severe acne is inherited. Unfortunately, the exact genetic component is not known yet.\n\nIf the acne does not respond to home and over-the-counter treatments after two months, it is a good idea to see a dermatologist before the condition produces scarring and/or takes an emotional toll. Dermatologists have numerous prescription medications and procedures available.\n\nAcne is a very common skin problem that shows up as outbreaks of bumps called pimples or zits. These usually appear on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders.
