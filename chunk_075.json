It is being developed by Beenox, developer of the previous games Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, Spider-Man: Edge of Time and The Amazing Spider-Man, and published by Activision.\nThe game will retain its open world gameplay of previous entries in the franchise. The game's free roam area of Manhattan will be more expansive, spacious and detailed than that of the previous game's, and most of the story will take place in the open world.In addition to advanced combat and upgrades, there will be different types of webbing (example, the player can use different webbings to freeze or blow up something on impact), and web-slinging will be similar to that of Spider-Man 2 and its subsequent based games. Unlike the previous game, all versions of this game will have free roam. The PS4 version can be played on the PS Vita using remote play, with optimized controls.\nThanks for watching guys, hope you enjoy if you did please make sure to leave a like and subscribe if you're new to my channel!\n\n\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 | \"Web Threads Suit Pack\" Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume \"Suits\" (SHOWCASE)\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 | \"Web Threads Suit Pack\" Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume \"Suits\" (SHOWCASE)\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 | \"Web Threads Suit Pack\" Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume \"Suits\" (SHOWCASE)\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 | \"Web Threads Suit Pack\" Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume \"Suits\" (SHOWCASE)\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 | \"Web Threads Suit Pack\" Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume \"Suits\" (SHOWCASE)", "title": "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 | Web Threads Suit Pack Gamestop Pre-Order DLC Costume Suits UNLOCKED", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T22:13:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gOnt1EA_VM", "description": "Working for ICE 'is hell right now,' as Obama plans amnesty for illegals\nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/working-for-ice-is-hell-right-now-as-obama-plans-amnesty-for-illegals/article/2556174\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

If your concerned about hygenine, simply wash the fruit with boiled water or give it a wash in the sea water at the beach. \nIf you are happy to consume mainly fresh young coconut juice and fresh fruit and veg, then its really inexpensive to stay in Thailand especially on the islands that aren't so overrun with tourists. \nAnyhow this is just the first of many movies covering our travels through Thailand and Berlin, so to stay in the loop be sure to subscribe to the channel. \n\nJoin my page on facebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Beauty-Plan/168926606517686?ref=tn_tnmn\n\nTo purchase my book on natural cellulite reduction visit www.TheBeautyPlan.com\n\nLove, \n\nEmily x", "title": "Fruit stall with Rambutan, bananas, durian and mangosteen in Koh Chang Thailand", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T12:39:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gPMuRCIllE", "description": "Full title: Solid-Phase Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Scaffolds through an Amide-Ketone Condensation/N-Acyliminium Cyclization Sequence\n\nVitaly Komnatnyy presents his PhD project", "title": "Solid-Phase Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Scaffolds", "publishedDate": "2011-10-24T14:57:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gPs9iYlo7E", "description": "C6H6 Benzeno Qu\u00edmica -  hydrocarbon - hidrocarboneto arom\u00e1tico - Original 3D modeling by Diego da Cruz Pereira available on TurboSquid\n\nModel link available on TurboSquid:\nhttp://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/c6h6-biology-3d-model/822848?referral=DiegoDCvids\n\n3D Polygons: 286,740\n3D Vertices: 283,476\n3D Render: Quicktime (3480X2160)\nVideo render: H.264 (3480X2160)\n\noriginal videos filmings, 3D modelings, arts animations created and directed by Diego da Cruz Pereira (DiegoDCvids)", "title": "Benzene (C6H6) 3D Model Available on Turbosquid", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T22:59:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gQQVSs6CqM", "description": "If You want to experience pure awesomeness of BRAUN J500 juicer, You better play this video now ;)", "title": "BRAUN J500 Multiquick 5 Juicer", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T22:33:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gQsAKZ71tU", "description": "If you want to learn the basics of How to Play Squash, England's Nick Matthew will tell you all that you need to know to get started.", "title": "How To Play Squash", "publishedDate": "2009-08-25T17:46:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gRCRTmwr8Q", "description": "united photostat & stationary", "title": "jatoi", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T04:25:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gRGMOhslq0", "description": "Music video by Sarah Silverman performing Give The Jew Girl Toys.

The classic black slip cover case that usually came with the games is pretty easy to come by, and will help keep dust from getting to your cartridge pins, but don't provide much protection beyond that.  The hard plastic cases typically used in video rental stores back in the day are much more durable and better for transporting Nintendo games, but take up more storage space.  However, to truly decide which case is superior, Kevin officiates a showdown of epic 8-bit proportions inside the underwater base.

Its a catamaran that is super buoyant, easy to build, and virtually tip-proof.  This is one SUP that anybody can master immediately.  The twin hulls can be moved closer together or further apart to change the way the craft behaves.  Wider stance means more stability.  Unlike our other products the Paddle Cat isn't intended for surfing.  It can handle swift water but is most at home cruising the bay or a lake.  We are planning a whole line of add-ons including a motor, sail, seats, whatever you can think of.  It will make a great fishing platform for you, your dog, and an ice chest full of your favorite beverages.  Best of all the platform is easy to detach and the two hulls can be transported in the back of a truck or on top of a car with roof racks.  The \"Stitch and Glue\" construction has been used to build countless boats and water craft.  It lets you quickly build a light, strong craft that looks great and paddles even better.

And off he went, never to be seen again... until 15 years later, he came to you as a ghost, urging you to follow his trail west.\n\nSo with your family, your savings, and the ghost of Uncle Gus, you journey to the new frontier as leader of the wagon train. But as the months wear on, morale begins to plummet. You stock hundreds of pounds of rodent meat, trade all your valuables for ammunition and candy, and most importantly, never stop to bury your dead - you're dumbfounded. Now Uncle Gus says the rest of the wagon families are plotting to leave you behind, but they don't know what's good for them.\n\nTo save them from themselves, it's up to you to go hunting six times a day, feed your party rotten meat, ford the river when it's 13 feet deep, and treat wounds by totally ignoring it... because who dies from a broken leg, anyway?\n\nBut as your Uncle Gus would say, \"it's all worth it when you're on The Oregon Trail.\"\n\n---------\n\nLore! http://bit.ly/nNfsws\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\nJOIN POLARIS: http://bit.ly/17MTzDW\nPOLARISGO: http://bit.ly/1ec7Hu6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4\nMusic courtesy of Epidemic Sound and Audio Micro\n\n---------\n\nThanks for watching Lore!", "title": "LORE -- Oregon Trail Lore in a Minute!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T19:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gkOkrtMtec", "description": "BellaSugarTV: http://popsugar.tv/\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/BellaSugar\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/popsugartv\n\nCelebrity Esthetician Kate Somerville shows us how to make an easy pimple spot treatment using a common household ingredient\u2014aspirin.

Welcome to my video on shaolin staff basics. Today I'll be demonstrating some of the fundamental techniques in order to help you understand how to use your staff a little better. We'll start with overhead swings. \n\nTo begin with, we'll start from our forwards stance. And this is a great way to train your stance and your weapon all at the same time. From here, you're going to bring your staff over your shoulder. Place your left hand on top of your right. You're going to begin by swinging the staff out to the side, bringing it behind you. As you bring it behind you, you want to tilt so that the staff should continue to flow past you, bringing it around so that it tucks underneath the arm, pivoting into your forwards stance, and then thrusting the palm out. \n\nOne more time, one, two, three, four, five. And then from, here, you just want to take the staff out, bring it around, and swing it like a baseball stick. And then it just starts over again. So, now I'll demonstrate full speed.\n\nThe next basic technique is what we call forward figure 8. From here, you're going to have your right hand firmly on the stick. Left hand is going to grasp with two fingers, and you use your thumb to guide it. As you bring your stick forward, bring it from side to side. You want the stick to travel as close to your body as possible. To reverse figure 8, for this one, you're going to have your right hand on the stick, and then place your left hand underneath. You're going to start by swinging behind you, and then bringing it up. \n\nNow, it's really important to keep your elbows high. Because the ceiling here isn't that high, I'm going to go a little bit lower. You want to use your body with the stick. Now we're going to take a look at the uppercut and the chop. Again, we're going to bring the stick over the head, on to the shoulders. We're going to do a change step, and release the staff at a 45 degree angle. Let it rest on your left shoulder. Bring it down, letting it snap underneath your arm. \n\nYou can visualize coming up underneath somebody's head, and then striking back down on the back of their head. Again, up, and then, down. Full speed. And you'll practice these techniques with a lot of repetition, so you can get really good at them.", "title": "5 Basic Staff Techniques | Shaolin Kung Fu", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T12:00:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3grG_V7IHnU", "description": "Hopi Indian prophecies are happening!!!

COLUMBIA, Mo. -- COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A state appeals court panel on Tuesday overturned the murder conviction of a Missouri man who has maintained his innocence while serving a 40-year sentence for the 2001 slaying and robbery of a newspaper sports editor.\nThe appeals court ruled that the prosecutor's office withheld evidence from defense attorneys for Ryan Ferguson that could have aided him during his trial for the strangling and beating death of Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt.\n\"Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that Ferguson did not receive a fair trial. His verdict is not worthy of confidence,\" Western District appeals court Judge Cynthia Martin wrote in the 3-0 decision.\nFerguson's case has been the subject of numerous national TV news shows, in part, because his 2005 conviction came after his high school classmate, Chuck Erickson, testified that he had recalled from dreams several years later that the two of them had been involved in Heitholt's slaying after a late night of Halloween partying.\nErickson received a 25-year sentence as part of a plea agreement for testifying against Ferguson.\nBut during an April 2012 court hearing, Erickson recanted his incrimination of Ferguson and said his memory of that night was hazy because he had been using drugs and alcohol. During that hearing, former Tribune janitor Jerry Trump also said he had testified falsely during Ferguson's trial when he identified Ferguson and Erickson as the two men he saw in the newspaper's parking lot where Heitholt was killed in the early morning of Nov. 1, 2001.\nCole County Judge Dan Green declined to grant Ferguson a new trial last year. Ferguson then took his case to the appeals court, which heard arguments this September. The appeals panel said Ferguson should be released if prosecutors have not filed notice of a retrial within 15 days after the court issues its formal mandate, which could take several weeks.\nFerguson's attorney, Kathleen Zellner, said she filed a motion Tuesday seeking his release on bond while prosecutors decide whether to re-try him. She visited Ferguson in a Jefferson City prison and later read a handwritten statement from him thanking supporters during a Columbia news conference with Ferguson's parents and girlfriend.\n\"We've won a major battle, however the war continues,\" Ferguson's statement said. \"I need your help now more than ever. Look forward to sitting at the Thanksgiving table with my family if justice permits.\"\nHis parents, Bill and Leslie Ferguson, expressed relief by the court ruling, vowed to try to also exonerate Erickson and renewed a public plea for tips that could help lead to a new suspect.\n\"We are looking forward to that day when he can walk out of there and truly be free,\" said Leslie Ferguson, a retired school teacher.", "title": "Wrongly Imprisoned Ryan Ferguson Murder Conviction Overturned Set To Go Free after 12 yr", "publishedDate": "2013-11-06T13:11:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3gwCNOMdRMU", "description": "\u25baInfo & Cheap Booking! : http://www.hotelz.tv/info/thailand/patong-beach/eFWvsPtCbHWv/nipa-resort.html\n\u25baBest Hotels in Patong Beach : http://www.hotelz.tv/search/Thailand/Patong-Beach/1.html\n\nCombining Thai architecture with modern comforts Phukets Nipa Resort is just a short walk from Patong Beach.

For the EP, see Emma Dean (musician). For the Seinfeld episode, see The Face Painter.\n\nBody painted New Orleans Saints fan in the 2010 La Fete Body & Face Painting Festival\nBody painting, or sometimes bodypainting, is a form of body art. Unlike tattoo and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, painted onto the human skin, and lasts for only several hours, or at most (in the case of Mehndi or \"henna tattoo\") a couple of weeks. Body painting that is limited to the face is known as face painting. Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) \"temporary tattoo\"; large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work is generally referred to as temporary tattoos.\n\nContents  [hide] \n1 Indigenous body painting\n2 Western body painting\n2.1 Body painting festivals\n2.2 Fine art body painting\n2.3 Body painting in the commercial arena\n3 Face painting\n3.1 Use in military\n4 Glitter tattoos\n5 Body paints\n6 Hand art\n7 Media\n8 See also\n9 References\nIndigenous body painting[edit]\nBody painting with clay and other natural pigments existed in most, if not all, tribalist cultures. Often worn during ceremonies, it still survives in this ancient form among the indigenous people of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific islands and parts of Africa. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as Mehndi, using dyes made of henna (hence also known rather erroneously as \"henna tattoo\"), was and is still practiced in India and the Middle East, especially on brides. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young women in the Western world.\n\nMany indigenous peoples of Central and South America paint Jagua Tattoos, or designs with Genipa americana juice on their bodies. Indigenous peoples of South America traditionally use annatto, huito, or wet charcoal to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.[1]\n\nActors and clowns around the world have painted their faces\u2014and sometimes bodies\u2014for centuries, and continue to do so today. More subdued form of face paints for everyday occasions evolved into the cosmetics we know today.\n\nWestern body painting[edit]\n\nA young woman with a butterfly painted over her breasts and chest\n\nBody painting at the Nakukymppi event in Padasjoki, Finland\nThere has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of social mores regarding nudity and often comes in sensationalist or exhibitionist forms.[2] Even today there is a constant debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form. The current modern revival could be said to date back to the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago when Max Factor, Sr. and his model Sally Rand were arrested for causing a public disturbance when he body-painted her with his new make-up formulated for Hollywood films.[3] Body art today evolves to the works more directed towards personal mythologies, as Jana Sterbak, Rebecca Horn, Youri Messen-Jaschin or Javier Perez.\n\nBody painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies.\n\nBody painting led to a minor alternative art movement in the 1950s and 1960s, which involved covering a model in paint and then having the model touch or roll on a canvas or other medium to transfer the paint.

The prices of milk were arbitrarily determined. Moreover, the government had given monopoly rights to Polson to collect milk from Anand and supply it to Bombay city.[7][8]\nAngered by the unfair trade practices, the farmers of Kaira approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel under the leadership of local farmer leader Tribhuvandas K. Patel. He advised them to form a cooperative and supply milk directly to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of Polson (who did the same but gave them low prices).[9] He sent Morarji Desai to organise the farmers. In 1946, the milk farmers of the area went on a strike which led to the setting up of the cooperative to collect and process milk.[8] Milk collection was decentralized, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1--2 litres of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village, too.[10]\nThe cooperative was further developed and managed by Dr.Verghese Kurien with H.M. Dalaya. Dalaya's innovation of making skim milk powder from buffalo milk (for the first time in the world) and a little later, with Kurien's help, making it on a commercial scale,[11] led to the first modern dairy of the cooperative at Anand, which would compete against established players in the market.\nIn June 2013, it was reported that the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited, better known as Amul Dairy, had signed a tripartite agreement to start a dairy plant in Waterloo village in upstate New York. The plant will initially manufacture paneer and ghee. Amul will use an existing dairy plant owned by New Jersey-based NRI Piyush Patel for manufacturing. The plant is strategically located, as it close to supply centres from where raw material is procured, and is near New Jersey, which has a large Indian population.[13]\nAmul said that it will be able to produce and supply Amul products in the US as well as Canada and export it to Europe, under the arrangement.\nAdding to the success, Dr. Madan Mohan Kashyap (faculty Agricultural and Engineering Department, Punjab Agricultural University Ludhiana), Dr. Bondurant (visiting faculty) and Dr Feryll (former student of Dr Verghese Kurien), visited the Amul factory in Gujarat as a research team headed by Dr. Bheemsen. Shivdayal Pathak (ex-director of the Sardar Patel Renewable Energy Research Institute) in the 1960s. A milk pasteurization system at the Research Centre of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana was then formed under the guidance of Kashyap. \u20b4 it is good product .\n\n\nAmul girl refers to the advertising mascot used by Amul, an Indian dairy brand. The Amul girl is a hand-drawn cartoon of a young, chubby Indian girl dressed in a polka dotted frock with blue hair and a half pony tied up.[1] The Amul girl advertising have often been described as one of the best Indian Advertising concepts because of their humour.[2]\n\n\nThe Amul girl was created as a response to Amul's rival brand Polson's butter-girl. The idea was conceived in 1967 once ASP (Advertising, Sales and Promotion) clinched the brand portfolio from the previous agency FCB Ulka. It was executed by Sylvester Da Cunha, the owner of the agency and his art director Eustace Fernandez on hoardings, painted bus panels and posters in Mumbai. The mascot, since then, has been mobilized to comment on many events of national and political importance like Emergency in India in 1976.[3]\n\nIn 1966, Amul decided to give their account to the Advertising agency called Advertising and Sales Promotion (ASP) to work on their ad campaign. Sylvester da Cunha, then the managing director of the agency and Eustace Fernandez, art director decided to create something that would grab the attention of every housewife in the country.[4] Dr Verghese Kurien, then chairman of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF) suggested a mischievous little girl as a mascot with two requirements. It had to be easy to draw and memorable as most of the advertising would be outdoor media which required hand painting in those days and the hoardings had to be changed frequently.[5]", "title": "AMUL NEW AD - Har Ghar Amul Ghar", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T14:04:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3h0heT3sVas", "description": "Total War: Shogun 2 Soundtrack - Ona Hei\nComposed By Jeff Van Dyck", "title": "Total War: Shogun 2 Music - Ona Hei", "publishedDate": "2011-03-21T01:56:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3h0kLmSujQ4", "description": "A Rock Rose Narancs Szalon t\u00e9m\u00e1ja a sz\u00e1j\u00e1pol\u00e1s.\nNyugati szemmel megvizsg\u00e1ltunk t\u00f6bb, nem nyugati sz\u00e1j\u00e1pol\u00e1si szok\u00e1st \u00e9s egy p\u00e1r m\u00f3dszert kipr\u00f3b\u00e1ltunk.

It is covered in large, irregular patches of yellow to black fur separated by white, off-white, or dark yellowish brown background. The average mass for an adult male giraffe is 1,200 kilograms (2,600 lb) while the average mass for an adult female is 830 kilograms (1,800 lb). It is approximately 4.3 metres (14 ft) to 5.2 metres (17 ft) tall, although the tallest male recorded stood almost 6 metres (20 ft).\n\nThe giraffe is related to deer and cattle, but is placed in a separate family, the Giraffidae, consisting of only the giraffe and its closest relative, the okapi. Its range extends from Chad in Central Africa to South Africa.\n\nGiraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, or open woodlands. However, when food is scarce they will venture into areas with denser vegetation. They prefer areas with plenty of acacia growth. They will drink large quantities of water when available, which enables them to live for extended periods in dry, arid areas.\nThe species name camelopardalis (camelopard) is derived from its early Roman name, where it was described as having characteristics of both a camel  and a leopard.

You will have done a back bend, like done your Ross in a bow. \n\nYou have done a standing, balancing posture like Tree Pose, and then, finally, you're ready to put all of those things together, into this pose, into Dancer's Pose. \n\nWhat you want to do, is come onto your right foot, point the left toes, and just feel the weight shift over onto that side. With your thumb up, you're going to reach behind. With your thumb down, you're going to torque the shoulder, and internally rotate. \n\nYou want to keep the shoulder internally rotate. You want to keep the shoulder externally rotated. Point the toe. Grab for the big toe side, and then resqueeze your knees back together. What that's going to do is get you back to center, and also give you the information of where your mid-line is, which will help you balance. \n\nFrom there, all fingers, even my thumb, are wrapping around the foot. This finger is going to reach forward, and it's like I'm pressing down into like a counter top, but pointing to my horizon line. The gaze is directly over this middle finger, nice and soft, and as I start to pitch forward, and hinge at the hips, both hips stay pointing down towards the ground, so this hip isn't open off to the side. They stay pointed towards the ground. I keep reaching towards my horizon line, pointing through the toes, reaching, and I kick back, and I reach. And I kick back, and I reach. I kick back, and I reach. \n\nThe more you go for it, the more you actually reach, reach, reach. It allows you to kick, to come out. I'm squeezing my knees back together, back together, back together, and then, I release the foot down, to come out of that balance. Just to swing a leg out, it's just too much for the body to try to balance. So, think about bringing those knees in closer together, and then finally releasing yourself to the floor.\n\nThat is Dancer's Pose.", "title": "How to Do a Dancer's Pose | Yoga", "publishedDate": "2012-06-29T05:27:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3hT6QOUhR-o", "description": "\"E-books & Intensive Courses available\nhttp://tiny.cc/o90sox\n\nThis video teaches you how to say or pronounce common english words.\n\nPronounce places\nhttp://goo.gl/uQ57Ft\n\nPronounce names\nhttp://goo.gl/rXvBAS\n\nPronounce phrases\nhttp://goo.gl/N1TT36\"", "title": "Here I will teach you how to pronounce 'demography' with Zira.mp4", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T07:06:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3hTMrXeAWkI", "description": "\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e : 25-07-2012\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n18+ Adults Only - Warning - Contains Graphic Images - Not for Shock - Documentary Evidence of Crimes Against Humanity committed by Syrian Dictator Bashar Assad.\n\u062a\u062d\u0630\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0633\u064a \u062c\u062f\u0627 +18 \u0648 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0645\u0624\u0644\u0645\u0629\n\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0647\u0648 \u062a\u0648\u062b\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0634\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0635\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0646\n=================================", "title": "Siria, Daraa AlHiraq 24 Luglio 2012", "publishedDate": "2013-05-08T10:32:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3hTdaaHVYzA", "description": "The Insurance Commission defers the liquidation of Prudentialife's trust fund.

Alana got mad once I said I have his sweaters, this bitch really think she can get under my skin like that; Showtime is just with her to make me jealous. \n\n\"Wait Alana!!\" I said closing my locker \"What?!\"She said turning around \"Whoa ! turn down the fucking attitude and come here\" I said getting that bitch in check \"yes\" Alana said calmly \"Walk me to Alex's locker\"I said \"Who?\"Alana said confused, HOW THE HELL DON'T YOU KNOW YOUR OWN \"BOYFRIEND'S\" REAL NAME ?!?! \"Showtime sweetheart\" I said \"Oh okay, but why?\" This hoe ask to many questions , for Pete Sake \"So you can wear one of his sweaters duh silly\" I said.

Each performer was required to transcribe one continuous line of poetry as read aloud by Casey Smith. Phrases were written so that the edge of the tape bisected the words. Writers were organized by height in correspondence to six parallel strips of masking tape on the blackboard:\n\n\"After the performance, the audience is invited to now join with the Writers in deciphering the now bisected text; to complete the words. All white chalk is removed and BLUE chalk is provided for text deciphering.\n\nWhat was only moments before written by their own hands has become a mystery for the Writers; words recently heard now are illegibly bisected and also fading from memory. Memory and visual acuity must be employed to help both the Writers and the audience to complete the bisected text. The inherent illegibility of bisected text is also further complicated by the brief snatches of words hastily scribbled that have become partial phrases. Additionally, since multiple participants wrote the words and phrases, visual recognition is also impaired by the juxtaposition of multiple handwriting styles. Fragmentation, juxtaposition and text-bisection all meld together to make a kind of poetic discourse about the act of comprehension itself.\"\n\nCamera & Editing: Nicolas Donnelly\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is not closely related to the slightly larger wild Asian water buffalo, but its ancestry remains unclear. Contrary to popular belief[citation needed], the African buffalo is not the ancestor of domestic cattle, and is only distantly related to other larger bovines. Owing to its unpredictable nature, which makes it highly dangerous to humans, the African buffalo has never been domesticated unlike its Asian counterpart, the water buffalo.\nThe African buffalo is a very robust species. Its shoulder height can range from 1 to 1.7 m (3.3 to 5.6 ft) and its head-and-body length can range from 1.7 to 3.4 m (5.6 to 11 ft). Compared with other large bovids, it has a long but stocky body (the body length can exceed the Wild water buffalo, which is rather heavier and taller) and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The tail can range from 70 to 110 cm (28 to 43 in) long. Savannah-type buffaloes weigh 500 to 910 kg (1,100 to 2,000 lb), with males normally larger than females, reaching the upper weight range. In comparison, forest-type buffaloes, at 250 to 455 kg (550 to 1,000 lb), are only half that size. Its head is carried low; its top is located below the backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rear, which is associated with the need to support the weight of the front part of the body, which is heavier and more powerful than the back.\n \nSavannah-type buffaloes have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls have whitish circles around their eyes. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are reddish brown in colour with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats.\nSource: wikipedia.org\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_buffalo", "title": "Water Buffalo Eating 2 - youtube.com/tanvideo11", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T21:17:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "3hoqTqKsNBQ", "description": "", "title": "Hilo dental entregando cartas", "publishedDate": "2014-03-11T23:28:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3hp0fhtKPSo", "description": "Trustworthiness: Ethical people are worthy of trust.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES: The body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type \n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:  Globally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES: This type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS: The several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:  Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:    Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more deatles - \n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n www.nadipathy.in\n     Nadipathy Centres \n1.

Tapi tidak demikian dengan warga Australia. Sebagian besar warga Australia setuju PM Abbott harus minta maaf ke Indonesia.\n\nBerdasarkan polling atau jajak pendapat yang dilakukan Sydney Morning Herald, Senin 18 November malam yang dilansir Liputan6.com, Rabu (20/11/2013), 59% dari 2.604 responden atau mayoritas warga Australia menginginkan negaranya untuk meminta maaf ke Indonesia. Sisanya 34% mengatakan Canberra tidak mesti meminta maaf ke Jakarta dan 7% tidak yakin dengan kedua pilihan tersebut.\n\nAtas isu penyadapan ini, Indonesia menarik Duta Besar untuk Australia, Nadjib Riphat Kesoema. Dubes Nadjib kini telah berada di Indonesia untuk menemui Presiden Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) untuk membahas penyadapan tersebut.\n\nLewat akun Twitternya, SBY mengatakan, tindakan itu telah mencederai hubungan strategis dengan Indonesia, sebagai sesama negara demokrasi. Karenanya, pemerintah melancarkan protes dan meminta penjelasan Australia atas tindakan spionase tersebut.\n\n\"Sejak ada informasi penyadapan AS & Australia terhadap banyak negara, termasuk Indonesia, kita sudah protes keras. *SBY*,\" kicau SBY lewat akun Twitter resmi, @SBYudhoyono, Senin 18 November malam.\n\nSBY menjelaskan, pemerintah RI telah melakukan langkah tegas, seperti menarik Duta Besar RI untuk Australia dan meninjau kembali sejumlah agenda kerjasama bilateral atas tindakan Australia yang SBY sebut menyakitkan.\n\n\"Kita juga akan meninjau kembali sejumlah agenda kerjasama bilateral, akibat perlakuan Australia yang menyakitkan itu. *SBY*,\" ujar SBY.\n\nNamun PM Australia Tony Abbott menolak untuk meminta maaf dengan dalih setiap pemerintah memang mengumpulkan informasi asing, seperti negara lain.\n\n\"Yang penting, kami menggunakan semua sumber daya kami, termasuk informasi untuk membantu teman-teman dan sekutu kami, tidak untuk menyakiti mereka,\" kata Abbott dikutip ABC.\n\nAbbott mengatakan pemerintah Australia tidak harus menjelaskan secara detil apapun usaha yang dilakukan untuk melindungi negaranya. Sebagaimana negara lain berusaha melindungi diri.\n\n\"Orang lain meminta kita untuk tidak melakukannya lagi kemudian mereka melakukan persiapan untuk melakukannya,\" tegasnya.\n\nMenurut Abbott, penyadapan yang dilakukan intelijen Australia itu 'wajar' dilakukan. \"Saya tidak yakin bahwa Australia harus meminta maaf atas operasi pengumpulan intelijen yang wajar, sama seperti saya tidak mengharapkan negara-negara atau pemerintah lain untuk meminta maaf atas operasi pengumpulan intelijen mereka yang wajar,\" tandas Abbott.

Making polymer clay pens is a very fragile matter. Be careful when baking!\n\nWant to purchase a pen? Available here: http://dft.ba/-6KME\n\nMaterials:\n\u2665 A bake-able pen. I'm using BIC Ultra Round Stic Grip. These, from experience, do not melt in the oven. TAKE CARE WHEN BAKING. (See #6 in INSTRUCTIONS)\n\u2665 Polymer Clay (Blue, White)\n\u2665 Superglue/E6000\n\u2665 Acrylic Paint (Black, White, Pink, Yellow, Red)\n\u2665 Paintbrush/Dotting Tools/Toothpicks/Needle Tool\n\u2665 Eye Pin & Head Pin (for the dangling charm)\n\u2665 Beads (Optional; for the dangling charm)\n\u2665 Scotch Tape (for the grip part. See #9 in INSTRUCTIONS)\n\u2665 Glaze/Varnish\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Remove the ink & grip from the pen. (Pliers may be helpful in this.)\n2. Place the cap back on and mark with a pencil how far the cap goes on.\n3. Take pieces of blue polymer clay and squish it against the pen. This avoids air bubbles appearing. Do not go over the marked line.\n4. Roll the pen to smooth the clay out. If there are air bubbles present, use a blade/needle to puncture the bubble and smooth it out again.\n5. Add on a platform on the end of the pen for Mouton to sit atop. Stick in an eye pin.\n\n***************************************************************\n6. BAKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEN: At 220 degrees F, bake this TWICE, 5 minutes at a time, with a 5 minute break between each session. (In other words, bake for 5 minutes, cool for 5 minutes, and then bake again for 5 minutes.) This prevents the pen from melting! ALWAYS keep a watch on it, just in case. Ovens vary! You may want to lower the heat if you want to be more safe.\n***************************************************************\n\n7. Sculpt Mouton and his circus ball. Use a head pin for the circus ball and bake these according to your clay package.\n8. When everything has finished baking and cooled down, start painting on the details. Try using a variety of tools, like dotting tools, toothpicks, and paintbrushes.\n9. Wrap scotch tape around the grip part. (You could have covered it with clay, but just to be safe that the cap still fits.)\n10. Cover the cap with blue paint and paint on the details on top.\n11. Finish it all off with a coat of glaze!\n12. Add beads to the dangling circus ball and attach this to the pen.\n13. Do a happy dance. ^O^\n\n\n\n\nW E B S I T E \u2665 http://puddingfishcakes.weebly.com/\nS H O P \u2665 http://dft.ba/-pfishcakes\nF A C E B O O K \u2665 http://www.facebook.com/Puddingfishcakes\nT W I T T E R \u2665 https://twitter.com/PFishCakes\nT U M B L R \u2665 http://puddingfishcakes.tumblr.com/\nP I N T E R E S T \u2665 http://pinterest.com/pfishcakes/\nS U B S C R I B E \u2665 http://www.youtube.com/user/puddingfishcakes\n\nMusic by Josh Woodward\nhttp://www.joshwoodward.com/", "title": "DIY Mouton the Elephant Themed Polymer Clay Pen {Stop Motion Tutorial} Sentimental Circus", "publishedDate": "2013-08-04T12:00:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iDS3d4GKP4", "description": "SONG: Hollywood undead- coming back down.\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/KliiesenDaJohanpok?ref=hl\n-------------------------------------------\nMy comp've crashed like crazy the few times I tried to upload this.\nTrying this once again.\nI'll go back to do serious work soon, I promise.\nAlso, this is pretty much for my brother, or should I say my life mentor?

Ad about young girls and new self-esteem fund. Producer: Dove. Creative Commons license: Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n\nYoung girls talk about body image and self esteem. Dove's message: Things won't change until we change them. The Dove Self-Esteem Fund. Whether it's models that wear a size 2 or movie stars with exceptional curves, beauty pressures are everywhere. And when young girls find it hard to keep up, low self-esteem can take over and lead to introversion, a withdrawal from normal life, and a waste of potential. For example, a recent survey in the United Kingdom indicated that 6 out of 10 girls thought they'd \"be happier if they were thinner.\" Low self-esteem leads to introversion, a withdrawal from normal life and a waste of potential. For too long, beauty has been defined by narrow, stifling stereotypes. Women have told us it's time to change all that. Dove agrees. We believe real beauty comes in many shapes, sizes and ages. That is why Dove is launching the Campaign for Real Beauty. Dove's global Campaign for Real Beauty aims to change the status quo and offer in its place a broader, healthier, more democratic view of beauty. A view of beauty that all women can own and enjoy everyday. Over 50% of women say their body disgusts them (Dove Internal Study, 2002). The body fat of models and actresses portrayed in the media is at least 10% less than that of healthy women (British Medical Association, 2000) 6 out of 10 girls think they'd \"be happier if they were thinner\" (UK Teen Body Image Survey, January 2004) While only 19% of teenage girls are \"overweight,\" 67% think they \"need to lose weight\" (UK Teen Body Image Survey, January 2004). Stereotypically \"perfect\" beauty imagery affects some girl's (and some women's) perceptions of themselves. Dr. Susie Orbach (psychotherapist, London School of Economics) has discovered that spending just three minutes looking at fashion magazines lowers the self-esteem of 80% of women. We can help girls to put \"perfect\" images of beauty into perspective. Let's face it, most of us are never going to look like the models we see in the media. But when we look at images in magazines and on the big screen, it's all too easy to forget the number of tricks that have been used to create them. But a small army of retouchers, camera operators, lighting technicians and props managers have created these artificial images.

Nena hat ihre Rolle als Coach gro\u00dfartig umgesetzt und ich werde versuchen, das Coaching-Team bestm\u00f6glich zu verst\u00e4rken.\u201c Als einzige Frau ihrer Band, besitzt Stefanie bestimmt auch den n\u00f6tigen Biss, um sich gegen\u00fcber ihren m\u00e4nnlichen Coach-Kollegen zu behaupten.\n\n\"Unfuckingfassbar!\" - Nachdem Rea Garvey letztes Jahr pausiert hatte, um sein neues Album \"Pride\" zu produzieren, wird er sich in der kommenden Staffel wieder in den Coach-Sessel schwingen und f\u00fcr seine Favoriten buzzern. \"The Voice of Germany ist die wichtigste Musikshow im deutschen Fernsehen und ich freue mich, wieder nach Hause zu kommen!\"\nAuch Sunrise Avenue-Frontmann,  Samu Haber bleibt The Voice of Germany erhalten. The BossHoss hingegen werden in dieser Staffel erstmalig nicht dabei sein. F\u00fcr die Cowboys und deren roten Doppelstuhl wurde aber ein w\u00fcrdiger Ersatz gefunden:  Mit Smudo und Michi Beck  von den Fantastischen Vier , konnte sich The Voice of Germany ein St\u00fcck deutsche Musikgeschichte sichern. Seit ihrem ersten Charterfolg \"Die da?!\" sind die Kult-Hip-Hopper nie richtig von der Bildfl\u00e4che verschwunden. Stattdessen versorgten sie Deutschland weiterhin mit Hits wie: \"TROY\" oder \"25\".\nDie neue Staffel \u201eThe Voice of Germany\u201c ab Herbst 2014 in SAT.1 und auf ProSieben.\n****************************************\u00ac****\n*Links sind Affiliate-Links\nImpressum: http://www.studio71.com/impressum/", "title": "Paradise City - Sonja Pelzl | The Voice | Blind Audition 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T21:47:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iQDqxmhTE4", "description": "Questo video \ufffd stato caricato da un cellulare Android.", "title": "Caporetto", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T12:32:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iQX8nzqwRc", "description": "Sedgefield Racecourse Flyover", "title": "Sedgefield Racecourse Flyover", "publishedDate": "2011-09-20T08:47:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iQbUxLRkTU", "description": "Artist - Terdamite.\nSong - Run A Way.\nFacebook page - http://www.facebook.com/pages/Terdamite/197922750297189?fref=ts", "title": "Terdamite-Run A Way -  [Sand Fly Riddim]", "publishedDate": "2012-09-27T13:29:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iR0lVqGaVw", "description": "pre-magic word at bbc", "title": "sound check at the bbc", "publishedDate": "2008-11-15T20:29:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iR9yrFqMEY", "description": "Music:\nDead Silence Hides My Cries-My Hard & Long Way Home (Instrumental)", "title": "DunkLeagueBLR: 6'2\" OSiP 17 year old dunks on PFOC", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T04:15:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iRBVhYh3Sg", "description": "Beneteau Antares at Saronic gulf.\nhttp://www.power7.net\nEngine : Nanni diesel 200HP\nFish fider - Depth meter Eagle.", "title": "Beneteau Antares at Saronic gulf.", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T09:30:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iRPvn6Wnt4", "description": "Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh tells Grazia Daily her 5 top tips for being a Chelsea Girl including the essential Chanel bag, dog and all important blow dry.\n\nFollow Grazia on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/grazia_live\nLike Grazia on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/GraziaUK\nSubscribe to Grazia on YouTube: http://bit.ly/s7v94h", "title": "Millie Mackintosh's Made In Chelsea Tips For Being A Chelsea Girl", "publishedDate": "2012-11-29T13:36:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iR_AavDs10", "description": "How to sculpt an epoxy clay dinosaur..HERE IS A LINK TO A PLACE ON LINE YOU CAN BUY IT..............http://www.sculpt.com OR www.kitkraft.biz", "title": "Dino Tech 15", "publishedDate": "2006-10-20T01:16:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iRdq_4gv1s", "description": "Magic XBOX is a device which produces an alternate source of energy - Eco Friendly!", "title": "Magic XBOX", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11T06:39:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iRgLq07u-g", "description": "Uma super figura adoravel", "title": "Um close de palpebra com Janet", "publishedDate": "2009-09-16T04:06:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iRwgCfIOU0", "description": "http://www.websighthangouts.com/google-plus-pinterest-with-peg-fitzpatrick If a blog post has enlarged images, use this hack/tip to pin them to your boards instead of the thumbnails.

They come in a wide range of colours and textures making them versatile for virtually all garden styles and situations. Most gardens can accommodate several varieties. Ideal for sensory gardens, where you'll be able to hear the breeze whispering through the taller varieties, the shorter types can also make an inspirational container planting. Our Ornemental grasses for the garden are available all year round. : http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk/ornamental-grasses \n\nMiscanthus sinensis will provide you with airy, plumed seed heads that endure from August until late January or longer. The plumes emerge in late summer or early autumn before fading to a silver-grey. The heads provide a translucent veil in winter sunlight as they disintegrate slowly. The slightest breeze will add an extra dimension to the winter garden, as well as movement, so it's important to position all miscanthus where they catch the light. Don't tuck them away in deep shade. M. sinensis has been grown in British gardens for over a hundred years and the famous wild gardener William Robinson (1838 - 1935) grew it as Eulalia japonica, or the Chinese silver grass. Most of the 17 species come from Eastern Asia. Gertrude Jekyll planted the horizontally banded 'Zebrinus', or Zebra Grass, to cast light and shade at Munstead Wood. The range expanded dramatically when the German plant breeder Ernst Pagels persuaded one of his 'Gracillimus' plants to set seed under glass in the 1950s. His first batch of seedlings showed great variability and now there are plum-plumed varieties like 'Ferner Osten' as well as silver-plumed ones like 'Silberfeder'. Heights vary greatly and there are variegated forms. Pagels had to persuade miscanthus to set seed at his German nursery in Leer, close to The Netherlands, because in the Northern hemisphere miscanthus creeps into flower too late in the year because it is growing right at the limit of its range. This is a double-edged sword because the hot summers found in parts of Asia and the heart of The United States do encourage miscanthus to produce unwanted seedlings. This is never a problem in our temperate climate. However miscanthus flowering times vary by as much as five weeks, depending where in Britain you live. RHS Wisley in Surrey (for instance) will sometimes have miscanthus in flower by July and Lady Farm in Somerset (a renowned NGS garden) will also have lots in flower by then. However in the heart of England, where I live, the earliest to flower is always 'Silberfeder' and even then it is always in the second half of August. Those in even colder places, in Eastern Yorkshire for instance, may have to wait until September. For this reason the one miscanthus I always grow is 'Silberfeder' because it is reliably earlier than most. : http://www.saga.co.uk/lifestyle/gardening/q-and-a/tall-grasses-for-winter.aspx \n\nMiscanthus can be deciduous or evergreen grasses with tufted or spreading habit, erect stems bearing arching, linear leaves and terminal panicles of silky spikelets in late summer or autumn : http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=5700 \n\nThe Poaceae (also called Gramineae or true grasses) are a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants. With more than 10,000 domesticated and wild species, the Poaceae represent the fifth-largest plant family, following the Orchidaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rubiaceae.  Though commonly called \"grasses\", seagrasses, rushes, and sedges fall outside this family. The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.\nGrasslands are estimated to compose 20% of the vegetation cover of the Earth. Poaceae live in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests, and tundra.

There are grasses for damp or dry soil, shady as well as sunny situations. Many are great to add to the cutting garden; others perform well in containers. : http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?pid=140 \n\nDanthonieae - Deschampsia -  Calamagrostis - Cortaderia - Poaceae\n\nPampas grass - Cortaderia selloana.\nPurple pampas grass - Cortaderia jubata  \nFeather Reedgrass - Calamagrostis", "title": "Ornamental grass - Miscanthus sinensis - Tr\u00f6llagras - Risastr\u00e1", "publishedDate": "2014-02-16T19:07:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iXTn9j4i8k", "description": "The ProType line was born out of unique putters crafted for the best players in the world.

When he feels too much pressure, his temper explodes with disastrous results. So when researcher Dr. Owen Leeds (Harris Yulin) offers him a somewhat unusual remedy for his problem, he gives it a try. Soon, a fully grown clone of Doug is delivered, complete with his memories up to the time of its \"birth.\" Being in two places at once offers some advantages, but problems arise when Doug #2 can't handle the stress of overwork any better than the original. Perhaps Doug #2 could benefit from having his own helper. Versions of Doug multiply, each of them emphasizing some facet of his character, and complications multiply. For instance, having more of him around doesn't make life simpler for Doug's wife Laura (Andie MacDowell).\n\nmultiplicity,\"multiplicity trailer\",\"multiplicity i like pizza\",\"multiplicity part 1\",\"multiplicity photography\",\"multiplicity steve\",\"multiplicity she touched my\",comedy,\"ethics videos\",\"syringe videos\",\"doug kinney\",\"harold ramis\",\"science videos\",\"laboratory videos\",\"rebirth videos\",\"harris yulin\",\"michael keaton\",\"lee r mayes\",\"dr leeds\",\"whitney white\",\"suzanne herrington\",\"computer videos\",\"accountability videos\",\"trevor albert\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++136525", "title": "Multiplicity (1/8) Movie CLIP - Doug is Cloned (1996) HD", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T01:36:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iZjQCZiWqQ", "description": "Track 2\nBeat by \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \n\nStyl Mo-Tsaki.Joker/Two-Face \"\u0391\u03a0\u039f \u03a4\u039f \u039c\u0395\u039b\u039b\u039f\u039d\" Promo cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5  JOKER/TWO-FACE 2\n\nTracklist\n1. \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 (beat by Wicca)\n2.

However, manganese crystals have yet to be found in nature and therefore it is technically not a mineral, although laboratory grown specimens can look like a natural stone.\n\n Manganese metal oxidizes superficially in air, rusts in moist air, and burns in air or oxygen at elevated temperatures. It dposes water slowly when cool and rapidly when heated, forming hydrogen gas and manganous hydroxide, and it dissolves readily in dilute mineral acids, generating hydrogen and various manganous salts. The chemical reactivity of the metal accounts for its utility in metallurgy and in various chemicalpounds.\n\n Pure manganese is produced by hydrometallurgical and electrolytic processes, while ferromanganese and silanganese are produced by the smelting of ores in a blast furnace or, moremonly, in an electric furnace. The latter process, involving the reduction of manganese oxides by carbon, is actually aplex thermodynamic problem. The higher oxides (MnO2, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4) can all be reduced to manganous oxide (MnO) by carbon monoxide, but this lower oxide can be reduced to the metal only at elevated temperatures by carbon. Smelting is furtherplicated by the action of the gangue oxides. For example, silica, an acidicpound, canbine with MnO and prevent it from being reduced\u2014a problem that can be corrected by the use of ores high in such basic constituents as lime and magnesia or by the addition of basic fluxes such as roasted limestone. However, this generates more slag, which tends to dissolve manganese and lower the amount of metal recovered in the melt. In addition, depending on the smelting temperature and the acidity or basicity of the slag, silica can be reduced to silicon and enter the molten metal.\n\n Manganese is a reactive element that easilybines with ions in water and air. In the Earth, manganese is found in a number of minerals of different chemical and physical properties, but is never found as a free metal in nature. The most important mineral is pyrolusite, because it is the main ore mineral for manganese.", "title": "extracting manganese from steel slag", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T21:32:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3idt1qP2W7k", "description": "player: S2.RS-LI (RO-SEN) \n\n\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u306e\u60f3\u3044\u3067 \u3067\u306eIIDX\u304b\u3089\u306e\u79fb\u690d\u66f2\u3067\u3059\n\n\u30c7\u30b8\u30ab\u30e1\u4fee\u7406\u7d42\u308f\u308b\u307e\u3067\u5c11\u3005\u304a\u5f85\u3061\u3092", "title": "\u3010jubeat saucer fulfill\u3011planarian [EXT] EXC", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T22:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ieJXzw-RHs", "description": "The head of the UN's Ebola response team has been in Liberia.

They both stay with you for life but inside are very different devices.\n\n\"A defibrillator is a device that's very similar to a pacemaker. A defibrillator is a bit different in that it senses if the heart stops and can actually shock the heart internally and return normal function,\" says Dr. Richard Chazal, a cardiologist with Lee Memorial Health System.\n\nThe pacemaker is meant for patients like Bob, with heart arrhythmias, which are not treatable with medication. It only works when it's needed.\n\n\"A typical pacemaker simply can keep the heart from going too slowly but if a person had their heart stop the pacemaker usually won't work,\" says Dr. Chazal. \n\nAbout the size of a pocket watch, the pacemaker is smaller and targets arrhythmias. A slightly bit bigger in size, the defibrillator takes up the pacemaker's function but includes the ability to jump-start the heart.\n\n\"A defibrillator will provide that pacing function but also in someone with a really bad heart where the heart might actually stop or having what we call ventricular fibrillation, that defibrillator can sense that event and immediately shock the heart within a matter of seconds,\" Dr. Chazal. \n\nYou doctor can address the suitability of either device.

It is our task to conduct these dialogues in the city and to bring together a diverse group of citizens representing public, private, civic, industry, non-profits, local philanthropies, workers, street vendors, urban poor groups, academe, women and youth who will consider scenarios for the future of Accra in 2040.\n\nCommunity focal persons have been enrolled to help us reach people from three excluded communities;Ga Mashie and Fadama (also known as Sodom and Gomorrah - the largest slum settlement in Accra), and Nima which is a predominantly muslim community also referred to as \"zongos\", whose inhabitants are often migrants from the regions, working in informal sectors and traditionally seen as an excluded minority.\n\nAn important legacy that we want to leave in excluded communities from this project, is the opportunity for people to imagine a better future for themselves and for their city. In order to share the ideas of this process more effectively, we are launching a short YouTube video competition called Accra Future-Now Video Competition.\n\n78 volunteers took part in 3-minute video recording, to answer three short questions on film:\na. What are your hopes and fears for the future of your community?\nb. What would you like to change about where you live?\nc. How will things improve when that change comes?\n\nThe project team will select 10 finalists whose videos will be compiled into a short DVD, these recordings will be placed on the ICD ACCRA YouTube website for broadcast during April.\n\nThe top three winners will receive cash prizes and support, to encourage them in community advocacy. Names will be announced in April and winners invited to attend a presentation dinner Tuesday April 23rd 2013 in Accra.", "title": "Finalist: Mariam Nelson of Ga Mashie, speaks to the ICD Accra Team", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T20:01:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3iry4hCaUZk", "description": "Video para identificar al pi\u00f1\u00f3n blanco (Jatropha curcas)", "title": "Pi\u00f1on blanco (Jatropha curcas)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T14:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3is-EtcbUmA", "description": "Part of an unreleased 2 hour recording session", "title": "Biggie Smalls - Mumbling & Whispering", "publishedDate": "2010-10-12T23:26:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3is-UbB-QYo", "description": "Blow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind\nmusic by John Rutter, words by William Shakespeare\nsung by CLOSER (Beverley Worboys, Sara Parry, Michael Robinson, Trevor Conner)\nPhotography by Lukas Fluri", "title": "Blow, Blow, Thou Winter Wind", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T17:07:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3is3A7K2Vfo", "description": "J'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette vid\u00e9o \u00e0 l'aide de l'application de montage de vid\u00e9os YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/editor).

Wiener is a lawyer. So is Rules Committee Chair Jane Kim, and Rules Member David Campos. Wieners move made last May 2012 shut down the SOTF. Wiener shut down the SOTF in retaliation for the SOTF basically indicting him for crime and corruption committed in office: SOTF Case 11048.\n\nThe Sunshine Case 11048 specifies criminal corruption by Supervisors David Chiu (D3), Malia Cohen (D10), Eric Mar (D1), and Scott Wiener (D8).  The City Attorney Dennis Herrera and a half a dozen members of the City Attorney's Office are also guilty of the crimes and coverups, as are Mayor Ed Lee, and District Attorney George Gascon. \n\nThe voters of San Francisco now faces a situation where their Mayor, their District Attorney, their City Attorney, many Assistant City Attorneys, as well as over half of their sitting members of their City & Count Board of Supervisors have committed major felonies in office. This may be one of the many reasons these criminals in government all seek to remove the newly elected Sheriff, before he investigates this mess and brings the required felony charges to the attention of the State Attorney General and/or the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California.\n\nIn this clip, Mayoral Candidate Currier calls out to all of San Francisco to start organizing home meetings every Saturday morning forward, all across San Francisco to organize quickly to \"RECALL THE MACHINE\" to end the corruption, and organized crime that runs San Francisco. \n\nCurrier will speak for about 20 minutes at a Citywide Rally, called for Portsmouth Square, in San Francisco's Chinatown, this coming Sunday September 16th, at 1 p.m.\n\nSan Francisco is suffering from a huge rash of violent hate crimes and felonies perpetrated by non-american people associated with the Chinese Communist Party, and the Peoples Republic of China.

Little attention has been paid to certain unsung innovators who participated in this fascinating fomentation, as jazz is thought to have first appeared on records in 1917, bursting suddenly on to the scene like Athena springing fully armed from an aneurysm in the brain of Zeus. Music existing chronologically and stylistically between the categories of ragtime and jazz tends to fall through the cracks, in retrospect. Perhaps the time has come for the world to recognize Harry A. Yerkes, an individual who was receptive to the new music and provided fertile ground for its development, as he led numerous ensembles whose recordings appeared on many of the popular labels between 1917 and 1924.\n\nYerkes was among the very first Columbia recording artists; his two 1905 xylophone solos were subsequently released on Columbia two-minute wax cylinders. He also performed as a bell ringer, but greater opportunities were in store for him. By September of 1917, Yerkes had secured a position at Columbia as leader of his own ensembles, and producer for many others. Yerkes was, in fact, responsible for setting up Ted Lewis with a steady contract at Columbia. The names of Yerkes' many recording bands are delightfully strange. A very abbreviated list includes Yerkes Marimbaphone Band, Yerkes Jazarimba Orchestra (spelled most often with only one \"z\" but occasionally with two), Yerkes S.S. Flotilla Orchestra, Yerkes Bellhops, the Novelty Five, and, most famously among early jazz enthusiasts, the Happy Six. The music played by these groups ranged from classical overtures and light-headed mood pieces through topical favorites (plenty of thematic material during the First World War), to something definitely informed by ragtime and pointing the way towards authentic jazz.\n\nHappily unencumbered by bandleader Art Hickman's often revoltingly racist attitudes, Yerkes was on board at Columbia as a producer when W.C. Handy, Wilbur Sweatman, Johnny Dunn, James P. Johnson, and Bessie Smith were encouraged to make records for this label. Yerkes employed remarkable musicians in his ensembles: clarinetist Alcide \"Yellow\" Nunez, trombonist Tom Brown, pianist Ted Fio Rito, trumpeter Earl Oliver, saxophone star Rudy Wiedoeft, and percussionist George Hamilton Green. He also hired instrumental talent from the Metropolitan Opera House. Crucially influential titles recorded by Yerkes' groups included \"Sensation\" by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, \"Louisiana\" by Walter Donaldson, \"The Sneak\" by Nacio Herb Brown, \"Tishomingo Blues\" by Spencer Williams, several novelty rags by Zez Confrey, \"Arkansas Blues,\" \"Ja-Da,\" and \"Singin' the Blues.\" Yerkes was also among the first to record early compositions by Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Maceo Pinkard, and the songwriting team of Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake.\n\nBy 1923, Yerkes seems to have begun to sense that times were changing more rapidly than he'd bargained for. After recording a couple of xylophone solos for Columbia in May of that year, he only produced another two dozen ensemble sides before fading into the woodwork in 1924 as the record market - and the Jazz Age - blew itself wide open. \n\n\nHarry A Yerkes Dance Orchestra - Swanee (1920)", "title": "Harry A.Yerkes Dance Orchestra - Swanee (1920)", "publishedDate": "2009-04-08T03:28:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3j23o8GdusY", "description": "I found this small Longan tree at my mom's friend's yard...no fertilizer,even pruning and care of that tree as i did this report...i think the tree age is about 2 years...it have 3 small fruits on the top.

Just maybe. You'd just as soon associate Fulcrum, an Italian company, with the tarmac side of cycling before putting them anywhere near a World Championship or World Cup podium. It's hard to believe that Fulcrum's three-year-old mountain bike division has been so successful on the competitive circuit in such a short period of time. But, believe it.\n\nA new contribution to the fledgling but flourishing Fulcrum mountain bike wheel division is the Red Metal 29XL. I'm not sure what Red Metal means exactly, but I do know that XL is short for: Extra Light. At 1750g, the Red Metal 29XL certainly is on the lighter side of the rotational spectrum. The redesigned tubeless rim, the new circular section aluminum straight-head spokes and Two-to-One spoke ratio mate to make a lightweight, rigid and reliable big wheel bonus. Of course, you can't forget the added benefits of the larger wheel platform which most of you likely know by now but if you don't, I'll save you some time: 29-inch wheels are faster, handle better, take hits better and...they are, faster. \n\nThe new Red Metal 29XL is also available in standard Quick Release 9mm with a Thru-Axle 15mm conversion kit so you won't run into compatibility problems if you switch forks down the road. \n\nIt's certainly been an exciting start for the young company and with the likes of Julien Absalon, the former World Champion and current French National Champion riding Fulcrum wheels all over the planet...the stepping stones to the Fulcrum legacy are being laid as we sit and watch.

British rocker and activist Billy Bragg began his music career in the late 1970s in London when he formed the punk rock band Riff Raff. His 1984 album, \"Brewing Up with Billy Bragg,\" included the song, \"It Says Here,\" a critique of politics and tabloid newspapers that still rings true today in the wake of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. In 1998 and 2000, he participated in two well-known albums \u2014 Mermaid Avenue, Volumes 1 and 2 \u2014 that gave voice to another folk troubadour who sang about the poor and working class: Woody Guthrie. Bragg composed music for lyrics written by Guthrie and performed many of the songs alongside the album's other main contributor, Wilco. But to speak of Bragg simply as a singer-songwriter misses his passion for speaking out against injustice and fighting for many causes. In the 1980s, he called for support for the 1984 strike by the National Union of Mineworkers, one of the most significant chapters in Britain's trade union history. It was ultimately defeated under the watch of then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Bragg went on to organize for the defeat of Thatcher and her Conservative government. He joins us for an extended interview and performance. He reflects on his long history of activism and sings several songs.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report, I'm Amy Goodman. As we return to my conversation with the legendary British singer-songwriter Billy Bragg. I asked him about the 1984 miners' strike in Britain.\n\nBILLY BRAGG: I'm in a very\u2014I'm one of those people who was born in a very fortunate time, when I\u2014you know, my parents' generation and grandparents' generation fought very hard for a welfare state in my country, in which the rights of the individual were underpinned by the collective provision of free healthcare, free education, decent affordable housing, proper pensions. And that was\u2014you know, that's what we refer to in my country as the post-war consensus. Parties came and went\u2014Labour, Conservative, Liberal. Nobody ever changed that, until Margaret Thatcher came along. And she decided that it will be better to have\u2014to pay less taxes. So she began to take apart the welfare state and that provision. And the government owned the coal mines. And although there was plenty of coal under our country, she then began to close them down. So they went on strike. And really, the strike became a defense of that welfare state, of those ideals of collective responsibility and collective provision.\n\nAnd as a singer-songwriter who had grown up listening to Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie and The Clash, it seemed to me that my place was to be, you know, there on the picket line playing songs. And it was interesting, because it was a bit of an education for me, because I didn't\u2014like I said, I didn't go to college, so I didn't know a huge amount about socialism. So it was a very steep learning curve. They wanted to know why this pop singer from London had come up to the coal fields, sitting up late at night on sofas with people, drinking cups of tea, smoking cigarettes, talking about politics. And so, yeah, I can tell you that my\u2014the great inspiration in my politics was Margaret Thatcher.

Blake Herron, Robert Ludlum\nFilm Description: The best-selling suspense novel by late author Robert Ludlum comes to the screen for a second time, following a 1988 made-for-TV movie. Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he's pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy named Marie (Franka Potente) ten thousand dollars for a ride to Paris. Encountering more professional killers bent on his destruction, Bourne discovers that he possesses a surprising degree of skill in combat, martial arts, and linguistics -- handy talents that clearly indicate his past includes work as a spy and assassin, but for whom? With Marie's reluctant help, Bourne edges closer to the truth, something CIA officials want concealed at all costs. The Bourne Identity co-stars Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.\n\n\"the bourne identity\",\"the bourne identity clip\",\"the bourne identity part 1\",\"the bourne identity ending\",\"matt damon\",\"clive owen\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"spy action adventure\",\"spy thrillers\",thriller,\"frank marshall\",\"richard n gladstein\",\"david minkowski\",\"patrick crowley\",\"matthew stillman\",\"doug liman\",\"andrew r tennenbaum\",\"robert ludlum\",\"equality videos\",\"understanding videos\",\"field videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262376,/m/0169dl,/m/03v3xp", "title": "The Bourne Identity (9/10) Movie CLIP - We Always Work Alone (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:36:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jLcFOEhxfs", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Cleaning PCB in acetone", "publishedDate": "2012-11-06T16:11:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jM8Cj_WbwQ", "description": "Some students are getting a little science with their summer.

Do you agree with our picks? Let us know @theACCDN!\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\n\n[FULL VIDEO TITLE] \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Top 5 Maryland ACC Football Moments | A Farewell To Maryland In The ACC", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T15:10:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jNlIGDRkvQ", "description": "From the album \"The Truth About Love\".

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer by John Keats", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T17:01:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jPpQUPsNqM", "description": "The Asa Saxophone Quartet at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama.", "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean The Asa Saxophone Quartet", "publishedDate": "2009-08-15T15:40:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jPqZfQnsj4", "description": "The new (is it even out yet?)

Namun, sekalipun kita sudah diberikan vaksin hepatitis, dalam beberapa kasus, masih saja ada orang yang terkena hepatitis karena berbagai faktor seperti tempat tinggal yang kotor/tidak terawat atau karena menjalankan pola hidup yang tidak sehat.

Many are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular.\nThey were written by students and clergy when the Latin idiom was the lingua franca across Italy and western Europe for travelling scholars, universities and theologians. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who sent up and satirized the Church. The collection preserves the works of a number of poets, including Peter of Blois, Walter of Ch\u00e2tillon and the anonymous one, referred to as the Archpoet.\nThe collection was found in 1803 in the Bavarian monastery of Benediktbeuern and is now housed in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "Best Tree House Forever", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T17:25:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jixDsHRaI0", "description": "", "title": "Candidatos para rector de U Nacional Ignacio Mantilla.mov", "publishedDate": "2012-03-20T19:48:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jj7-l7BIEY", "description": ".", "title": "Fructidor et Moi - Stage saut", "publishedDate": "2008-07-28T16:54:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jkEZF14MGE", "description": "\"Uganda Giant\" Cycad", "title": "Encephalartos whitelockii Cycad", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T16:12:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jkN-tOp-XY", "description": "I didn't own anything \nReprinted from Nicovideo", "title": "\u3010Project DIVA Arcade\u3011World's End Dance Hall  \u3010Miku (AMERICANA) - Luka (\u30af\u30a4\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc)\u3011", "publishedDate": "2013-05-14T01:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlCK1RhIao", "description": "", "title": "Bruno Mars - \"Again\" [Subtitulada]", "publishedDate": "2014-06-05T22:27:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlDI5ewLBc", "description": "Taken from the 6CD album \"theoretically pure anterograde amnesia\" on V/Vm Test Records.", "title": "The Caretaker - memory 01", "publishedDate": "2009-02-19T11:38:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlLdrj23RU", "description": "2003\u5e74", "title": "#024-SQUEEZE!!-\u6d41\u308c\u661f", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T15:44:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlgo3bqp7c", "description": "We got Arnold Schwarzenegger arriving at the airport and as Arnold struts in the crowd erupts into applause!", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger Is The King Wherever He Goes!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T18:00:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlr-Du_e2I", "description": "10 000 programmes \u00e0 consommer en illimit\u00e9, le juke box vid\u00e9o pour toute la famille ! \nCin\u00e9ma, s\u00e9ries, kids, mangas, d\u00e9couverte, musique.\nSVOD : Pass vid\u00e9o illimit\u00e9 disponible sur Freebox, Orange livebox, Numericable mais aussi sur www.jookvideo.com compatible smartphones & tablettes.", "title": "JOOK Video", "publishedDate": "2014-10-15T14:14:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlvR5cyxco", "description": "Photographed at the Turtle River State Park, North Dakota (09 October 2010).", "title": "Celery Looper Moth (Noctuidae: Anagrapha falcifera) Feeding", "publishedDate": "2010-10-11T01:18:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jlzcu2V-MM", "description": "Repairing the gallery of a Burmos British roarer burner using silver brazing filler.", "title": "Gallery Brazing", "publishedDate": "2012-09-02T00:52:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jm0gf2ET3k", "description": "Weighing fresh chicken pieces using Ishida multihead weigher.", "title": "Ishida Multihead Weigher.

Se trata de un enfoque sist\u00e9mico, enfermedad cr\u00f3nica, autoinmune impulsado que no s\u00f3lo afecta a las articulaciones sino \u00f3rganos internos. La enfermedad ha sido asociada con una mortalidad significativa que causa a las personas afectadas por la enfermedad, la muerte 7-10 a\u00f1os antes que las personas que no tienen AR. Adem\u00e1s, se asocia con una morbilidad significativa, es decir, los pacientes sufren una p\u00e9rdida de independencia, as\u00ed como la capacidad de continuar con la actividad laboral remunerada.\n\nUn conjunto previo de las directrices de la American College of Rheumatology en 2008 presentado recomendaciones de tratamiento y pautas para iniciar y cambiar a otros medicamentos.\n\nSin embargo, estas directrices se formularon ante el conocimiento completo sobre el efecto de los nuevos medicamentos en curso de la enfermedad se aprecia plenamente. Aquellos de nosotros en la pr\u00e1ctica, por supuesto, se sinti\u00f3 estas directrices eran anticuadas como ellos fueron puestos en libertad.\n\nLas directrices m\u00e1s recientes frente a los nuevos descubrimientos y tambi\u00e9n hacen recomendaciones acerca de c\u00f3mo utilizar f\u00e1rmacos biol\u00f3gicos en pacientes de alto riesgo. Como resultado de ello, creo que estas directrices no tienen m\u00e1s sentido y apoyar el enfoque del tratamiento que la mayor\u00eda de m\u00e9dicos privados ya seguir.\n\nEl punto clave que los autores hicieron fue que la actividad de la enfermedad bajo o incluso la remisi\u00f3n debe ser el objetivo del tratamiento. Este es un punto cr\u00edtico. Ahora es posible obtener la mayor\u00eda de los pacientes con AR en remisi\u00f3n.\n\nUno de los principales cambios respecto a las directrices de 2008 fue el \u00e9nfasis en un tratamiento m\u00e1s agresivo en los pacientes con AR temprana que es - los primeros 6 meses del inicio de la enfermedad. El cambio recomendado a la terapia m\u00e1s intensiva temprana es necesaria, ya que el tratamiento precoz m\u00e1s agresiva puede dar mejores resultados.\n\nNo es ning\u00fan secreto que el diagn\u00f3stico precoz y el tratamiento hace una gran diferencia en los resultados del paciente.\n\nDado que el da\u00f1o articular en la AR es irreversible, la prevenci\u00f3n de los da\u00f1os es un objetivo importante. Adem\u00e1s de las cuestiones obvias conjuntos, la preservaci\u00f3n de la funci\u00f3n f\u00edsica y la calidad relacionada con la salud de la vida es importante con el fin de limitar la probabilidad de discapacidad.\n\nPara ello, se recomiendan instituci\u00f3n temprana de la enfermedad antirreum\u00e1tico modificador de la droga (FAMEs), f\u00e1rmacos que retardan la tasa de progresi\u00f3n de la AR. Ejemplos de ello ser\u00edan medicamentos como el metotrexato e hidroxicloroquina (Plaquenil). Medicamentos biol\u00f3gicos se debe agregar r\u00e1pidamente si DMARD terapia no parece estar funcionando eficazmente. Medicamentos biol\u00f3gicos incluyen el factor de necrosis tumoral (TNF) adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), o infliximab (Remicade). No TNF biol\u00f3gicos incluyen abatacept (Orencia), tocilizumab (Actemra), o rituximab (Rituxan).\n\nOtro punto: Biol\u00f3gicos no debe combinarse ya que no hay aumento de la eficacia, sino que hay un aumento en los efectos secundarios.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, cuando pienso en lo lejos que hemos llegado con nuestro enfoque de la RA desde que comenz\u00f3 la pr\u00e1ctica en 1981, la diferencia es a la vez sorprendente y gratificante.\n\ntratamiento natural artritis\nremedios naturales artritis\ncomo curar la artritis\nmedicina natural artritis\nremedios caseros artritis\naliviar artritis\nartrosis\nosteoartritis\nartritis manos\nartritis rodillas\nartritis dedos\nartritis articulaciones\ntratamiento casero artritis\naliviar dolor artritis\ntratamiento artritis reumatoide\ntratamiento artritis", "title": "NUEVO TRATAMIENTO NATURAL PARA LA ARTRITIS REUMATOIDE", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T16:11:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jpLo1A4x_g", "description": "Music video by Scouting For Girls performing Elvis Ain't Dead.

Natural remedies for uterine fibroids are an alternative form of treatment that is both safe and reliable. Uterine fibroids, also known as fibroid tumors, leiomyomas, or myomas, develop within the uterus. Women across the globe face this problem in their reproductive years. The popularity of natural treatments specifically for uterine fibroids has risen in the last few years.\n\nNatural treatments for fibroids tend to be much safer compared to conventional medication as they cause little or no side effects. This is because, unlike conventional medication, natural treatments do not interfere with your body's internal mechanism. If you are looking for natural remedies for your uterine fibroids, these are some of the options available to you:\n\n. Herbs- Using herbal treatment for your fibroids helps in balancing the hormonal activity and strengthening the liver, thereby reducing estrogen levels in the uterus. Herbs also help in dealing with difficulties like heavy bleeding and excruciating cramps. Herbs like vitex, help in lowering estrogen level, while herbs like dandelion root and milk thistle, help in improving liver function. Other herbs like nettle and yellow dock work towards detoxification of the body and help to regulate the heavy bleeding caused due to fibroids.\n\n. Proper Diet- This is possibly the most fundamental treatment among all the natural remedies for uterine fibroids. A diet rich in saturated fats will cause your liver to be dysfunctional and subsequently increase estrogen levels and cause hormonal imbalances. A recommended diet would be one which is low fat and high fiber. Therefore, foods like oats, millet and brown rice, fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and soy are advisable. It is safe to avoid dairy products in general. The key factors to ensure are that firstly, your diet is mainly alkaline-forming so as to balance the acidic content in your body and secondly, the food you eat does not overwork your digestive system. \n\ntreatment for uterine fibroids\ntreatment for uterine fibroids during pregnancy\ntreatment for uterine fibroids removal\ntreatment for uterine fibroids symptoms\ntreatment for uterine fibroids canada\ntreatment for uterine fibroids tumor\ntreatment for uterine fibroids with ultrasound\nbest treatment for uterine fibroids\nherbal treatment for uterine fibroids\nnon surgical treatment for uterine fibroids\nnatural treatment for uterine fibroids\ntreatment for uterine fibroids hysterectomy\nalternative treatment for uterine fibroids\nhomeopathic treatment for uterine fibroids\nnon invasive treatment for uterine fibroids\nnew treatment for uterine fibroids\nholistic treatment for uterine fibroids\ntreatment for uterine fibroid tumors", "title": "Treatment for Uterine Fibroids", "publishedDate": "2011-12-14T23:13:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3jxFUMWd7Fs", "description": "This is me demonstrating a simple spray deodorant and lighter flamethrower.

The Trovan victims had agreed to settled out of court two years ago when Pfizer agreed to pay seventy five million dollars compensation but till date only six of the two hundred victims have been compensated. According to the victims, a controversial DNA test was introduced by Pfizer which excluded many of the victims. At this new hearing, Pfizer described this new legal action by the victims as groundless because it has already settled their claims on mutually agreeable terms. Pfizer was sued after 11 children died in a clinical trial when the northern state of Kano was hit by Africa's worst ever meningitis epidemic in 1996. A hundred children were given an experimental oral antibiotic called Trovan, while a further hundred received ceftriaxone. Five children died on Trovan and six on ceftriaxone. Later it was claimed that Pfizer did not have proper consent from parents to use an experimental drug on their children and questions were raised over the documentation of the trial. Legal action filed against the company alleged that some received a dose lower than recommended, this left many children with brain damage, paralysis or slurred speech. \n\n\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/11/22/335945/pfizer-in-court-again-over-1996-nigeria-child-deaths/\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This Video may contain copyrighted (\u00a9 ) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Themes of separation and loss are woven throughout the album, from the percolating electronic gallop of the opening track, \"Unwise\", to the blue-eyed soul of \"Aeroplane\", to the acoustic haze and layered harmonies of \"Overboard\", Mease always keeps things interesting.  One can hear the effect of the myriad of music styles and genres that informed Lapland -- early synth pioneers of the 60\u2032s and 70\u2032s, and 1970s staples like Fleetwood Mac.\n\nMixing styles is not new for Mease. He grew up in Texas where his childhood love of rock and country evolved into studying jazz guitar. After moving to New York, he eventually shifted his focus from playing jazz to singing and writing songs. This transformation gives Mease a unique approach to songwriting, and his work has earned him fans not only in indie circles but also in jazz, R&B, and classical music as well.  \n\nLapland Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/listentolapland\nLapland Twitter - https://twitter.com/listentolapland\nLapland YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/user/ListenToLapland\n\nBuy the album \"Lapland\" on iTunes - http://smarturl.it/na1bqa\n\nhttp://www.listentolapland.com", "title": "Lapland - Drink Me Dry", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T15:08:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3k9wC0Hu_20", "description": "Elbert, Gordon, and David Gladden work on the stern post of the Skipjack Ida May at Scott's Cove Chance MD 7/10/2010", "title": "At Scott's Cove:  7/10/10 Stern Post Part 2", "publishedDate": "2010-08-02T18:24:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3k9wJ10SQbo", "description": "\u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d / \u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442 / funny\n\n\u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d / \u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442 /\u0421\u043f\u044f\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0442\u0430 / \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u0438 / \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0438 / \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 / funny cat / \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u0438 / \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e / \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 / \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432 / \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044b / \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044b / \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e / \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e / cat / cats / funny / fun / \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 / \u043a\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0441\u043f\u044f\u0442 / \u041a\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b / \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438/ \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 / \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043a /  \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043a", "title": "\u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d / \u041a\u043e\u0442 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442 / cat snorer / funny / \u732b", "publishedDate": "2013-01-12T19:52:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3k9wU-_fk9c", "description": "Song Download: http://goo.gl/XljqEi\n\nThe Video Rights Is From B I N G L E!", "title": "[EDM] - B I N G L E - Coming Home", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T12:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3kAaYLfg7jE", "description": "Follow me on Twitter!
