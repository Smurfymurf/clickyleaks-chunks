Diese langwachsenden Triebe bilden vier deutlich hervortretende Rippen mit r\u00f6tlich gef\u00e4rbten Areolen. Den Areolen entspringen 6 bis 8 d\u00fcnne, starre und br\u00e4unlich gef\u00e4rbte Dornen.\n\nW\u00e4hrend des Sommers bilden sich an der Seite der Triebe 2 bis 3 cm durchmessende, wei\u00dfrosa gef\u00e4rbte, schalenf\u00f6rmige Bl\u00fcten. Nach der Bl\u00fcte bilden sich rote Beeren, deren Samen man zur Aussaat verwenden kann. Jede einzelne Areole bl\u00fcht nur einmal - Triebe die in einem Jahr reichlich Bl\u00fcten gebildet haben bl\u00fchen erst wieder, wenn nach einigen Jahren neue Areolen nachgewachsen sind.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung des Pfeiffera\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Kakteen der Gattung Pfeiffera ben\u00f6tigen einen hellen Standort. Im Sommer m\u00fcssen die Kakteen aber durch eine Abschattung vor der direkten Sonneneinstrahlung gesch\u00fctzt werden.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Wachstumsphase gie\u00dft man die Pfeiffera m\u00e4\u00dfig. Der Topfballen sollte beim W\u00e4ssern zwar vollst\u00e4ndig durchfeuchtet werden, vor der n\u00e4chsten Wassergabe l\u00e4sst man die Erde dann aber an der Oberfl\u00e4che gut antrocknen.\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Ruheperiode wartet man mit dem W\u00e4ssern bis die Erde etwa in die Mitte des Topfes hinein abgetrocknet ist.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Kakteen wachsen ganzj\u00e4hrig bei normalen Zimmertemperaturen. Auch w\u00e4hrend der winterlichen Ruheperiode muss die Temperatur nicht abgesenkt werden.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nZur Vermehrung der Kakteen kann man die Samen der reifen Beeren benutzen. Wenn die Beeren im Herbst aufplatzen dr\u00fcckt man den Inhalt auf einem Blatt L\u00f6schpapier aus. Innerhalb einiger Tage trocknet das Mark aus. Nun l\u00f6st man den Samen sauber heraus und lagert die Kakteensamen bis zum n\u00e4chsten Fr\u00fchling in einem  Umschlag. Nach der Aussaat entwickeln sich meist recht schnell die jungen Kakteen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nDie Kakteen der Gattung Pfeiffera kultiviert man in Kompost- oder torfhaltiger Erde. Um das Substrat aufzulockern und den Wasserabzug zu verbessern mischt man der Erde etwa 1/3 scharfen Sand hinzu.\nUmtopfen\n\nWenn das Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df gut durchwurzelt ist, topft man die Kakteen im Fr\u00fchjahr in gr\u00f6\u00dfere Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe um. Hierf\u00fcr nimmt man den Wurzelballen zu Beginn der Wachstumsphase vorsichtig aus dem Topf und kontrolliert die Wurzelsubstanz.\n\nFalls ein Umtopfen noch nicht notwendig erscheint, sch\u00fcttelt man das alte Substrat vorsichtig aus Wurzelwerk und setzt die Kaktee in das sorgf\u00e4ltig gereinigte und mit neuer Erde aufgef\u00fcllte Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df zur\u00fcck. Besonders wirkungsvoll kommt die Pfeiffera in einer Blumenampel zu Geltung.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nKakteen der Gattung Pfeiffera werden alle 14 Tage mit einer schwach konzentrierten D\u00fcngergabe eines kalireichen Volld\u00fcngers gegossen.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\nSchmierl\u00e4use / Wolll\u00e4use\n\nDer Befall mit diesen Pflanzensch\u00e4dlingen wird \u00f6fter an Kakteen beobachtet. Das kleine, wei\u00dfe, an Watteb\u00e4usche erinnernde Gespinst der Wolll\u00e4use ist gut auf den Bl\u00e4ttern der befallenen Pflanzen zu erkennen.", "title": "Pfeiffera monacanthum,  Kakteen", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T22:37:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JOyjuBwaBE", "description": "What is an oxygen sensor?

A five-year-old Affenpinscher named Banana Joe V Tani Kazari (AKA Joe), was awarded Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in the year 2013. This win was notable since this was the first time this breed was awarded Best in Show.\nAffenpinscher is a dog with a shaggy and wiry-type of coat. It gets a distinct look with hair on the face which is much longer than the rest of its body. This is smaller version of a working terrier which is not a delicate dog. The body of this breed is square had has a moderately broad and deep chest. The head is round with a distinct stop and is the transition area from the backskull to the muzzle.

Here\u2019s how to spot the warning signs.\n\n\nWarning\nEven if you see symptoms in your friend, only a medical professional can actually diagnose them. \n\nStep 1: Consider their mood\nObserve if your friend experiences extreme mood swings without anything provoking them, or if they have persistent feelings of sadness over time. These can be signs of mood disorders, with bipolar disorder and depression being the most common.\n\nTip\nKeep in mind that some symptoms can be temporary reactions to stress or grief \u2013 not signs of mental illness.\n\nStep 2: Consider their temperament\nObserve their levels of anxiety. If they have a persistent inability to relax or sleep, lack concentration, are easily agitated, and have muscle tensions or a rapid heartbeat over a period of at least six months, those may be signs of an anxiety disorder.\n\nStep 3: Observe their awareness\nAsk yourself if your friend hears or sees things that are not real, or experiences delusions. Psychotic disorders involve a distorted way of thinking and awareness.\n\nStep 4: Consider their social behavior\nAsk yourself if your friend has exhibited any erratic, unusual, or inappropriate behavior in work, school, or social relationships, seems disinhibited in front of others, or is anxious and afraid around others. These can be symptoms of a number of personality disorders. \n\nStep 5: Consider compulsions\nAsk yourself if your friend has been performing compulsive, ritualistic behavior or unnecessarily repetitive actions, like constant hand-washing or checking things repeatedly. \n\nStep 6: Observe signs of self-injury\nCheck to see if your friend exhibits evidence of self-harm or self-inflicted wounds, like cutting or scratching. Also, notice if your friend has become extremely thin or has expressed excessive negative attitudes and emotions about weight or food. Eating disorders, like anorexia nervosa and bulimia are classified as mental illnesses. \n\nStep 7: Consider substance abuse\nAsk yourself if your friend has any indications of drug or alcohol abuse. \n\nStep 8: Talk to them\nIf your friend has exhibited any of these symptoms continually or several months, it may indicate they have a mental illness. Talk them in a supportive way and suggest they see a qualified physician or counselor for advice or help.\n\nDid You Know?\nA Stanford University study found that graduate students in creative disciplines shared more personality traits with a set of bipolar patients than with a group of their healthy \u2013 but non-creative \u2013 peers.", "title": "How to Identify Symptoms of Mental Illness in a Friend", "publishedDate": "2010-05-20T12:00:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JjeouphjHQ", "description": "Helloooooo ... why does this place look familiar to me???  Why am I here again??  It certainly was through no fault of my own.  Hi there, my name is Kramer and I am a Chocolate Curly Coated Retriever about 3 years old.  Unfortunately, my owner is having some serious medical problems and will not be able to take care of me, I truly hope he is going to be okay. The first time I was here, me and three of my brothers were picked up as strays and our owner decided that we needed a better life. I thought I had found the better life ... but, it looks like I'm off to search for that better life again.  I keep telling myself that it shouldn't be hard to do, cause I am a very happy, friendly guy.  In fact the staff just love me, shhh don't tell the other dogs, but I'm laying underneath one of the girl's desks right now, just wish it was in my very own home.  I can lay at your feet while you do that Facebook stuff or watch TV, we could be soo much comfort for one another.

Geologically, it is principally composed of sodium and potassium rich rhyolite with some sandstone surrounds. Potassium-argon dating gives and age of between 25 and 26 million years. One of the most notable features of the mountain geology is the striking columnar / crystal jointing patterns clearly visible both on the main cliffs and the faces of the disused quarry.\n\nAlthough the geology of Mount Coolum is in itself quite spectacular, some of its most important aspects are not so immediately obvious. Ecologically, Mount Coolum is one of the most important square kilometres in Australia. The diversity of plant life within such a confined area is unequalled. The site has been intensely studied and over 700 plant types are now documented. This includes 590 flowering plants, 49 ferns and over 100 species of the lesser plants such as mosses, liverworts, lichens etc. By way of comparison, there are only 1400 species in all of Great Britain. Deserving particular note is the fact that the 49 ferns belong to 20 distinct families, some 40% of all fern families living on earth today. Psilotum Nudum, evolutionary the world's most primitive plant, is common. Two recently discovered species of trees are found nowhere else, and the area in general is unique in that numerous species find the limit of their distribution, be it in northern or southern, on Mount Coolum.", "title": "Mt Coolum, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia", "publishedDate": "2014-01-24T17:14:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JqLQ81O4bI", "description": "", "title": "Soberbio Gol de Enner Valencia en el West Ham United 18/10/14", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T20:32:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JqhR1sPtMc", "description": "This is the largest fruiting of Yellows I've seen in the Northwest!

This video illustrates the operation of FBMF, a novel fine-grained backpressure scheduling algorithm for controlling the motion and communication of a set of robots ferrying messages from a set of sources to their corresponding sinks. At each time each robot is allocated to source-sink nodes in such a way as to maximize the sum of weights in the selected matching. Weights between a robot and a given source or sink are calculated based on their queue differential and pairwise transmission rate, which is assumed to be monotonic with distance. We have proved mathematically for a single-flow, single-robot setting that this algorithm is throughput-optimal, i.e. it can stabilize queues for any arrival rate vector in the feasible throughput region. Simulations such as this one indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of throughput and delay for the general case as well.\n\nAuthors:\nAndrea Gasparri,  University Roma Tre, Italy\nBhaskar Krishnamachari, University of Southern California, USA\n\nAnimation by Shangxing Wang, University of Southern California, USA", "title": "Fine-Grained Backpressure Control of Message Ferrying Robots", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T08:13:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Jsq0-03c9c", "description": "Relief procedures in various situations.", "title": "Loose Impediments and Obstructions - Rules 21 and 24", "publishedDate": "2009-12-16T15:39:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JtAjzNUEgM", "description": "Um v\u00eddeo que mostra dois tamandu\u00e1s-bandeira se alimentando de cupins.", "title": "Tamandu\u00e1-bandeira", "publishedDate": "2011-06-21T15:13:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JtDw4PMZHY", "description": "This is my first attempt at a time lapse!

It has high morbidity and mortality rate with ranges between 9 and 43%, with high incidence of severe wound infection and history of long hospital stays. Many factors, such as late presentation, adequate pre-operative resuscitation, delayed operation, the number of perforations, and the extent of faecal peritonitis, have been found to have a significant effect on the prognosis.\n\nWhen diagnosed as ileal perforation, patient should be planned for emergency surgery either open or laparoscopic method. If one is surgically expert in laparoscopic surgery then he can go for laparoscopic repair of ileal typhoid perforation with primary closure of perforation and thorough peritoneal toileting.\n\nBefore surgery patient needs proper resuscitation with intravenous fluid, intravenous antibiotics like ceftriaxone, metronidazole. Electrolyte imbalance to be corrected and hourly urine output will give the hydration status of the patient. Normal serum electrolyte and urea are considered as good indicator of resuscitation.\n\nWhen surgery is done open method a long midline or paramedian incision is given. All pus and contamination to be removed and thorough peritoneal lavage with copious amount of normal saline to be done. The perforation site to be identified, the margin of perforation to be sent for histopathology study. Single perforation to be closed with primary repair with 3-0 vicryl with second layer with 3-0 silk suture. Drains were inserted to drain the right paracolic gutter and the pelvic cavity and attached for continuous drainage.\n\nWhen done laparoscopically if single perforation present with limited contamination then the surgical outcome is good.\n\nBut if there is multiple perforation with gross contamination then it is better to go for open repair method.\n\nTime of presentation, amount of contamination, number of perforation , pre op patient patient resuscitation all influence post operative outcome in case of typhoid ileal perforation.\n\nComplications of single perforation are like - wound infection, wound dehiscence and residual intra-abdominal abscess, chest infection, pleaural effusion all can be encountered and to be managed accordingly.", "title": "Typhoid Ileal Perforation - Laparoscopic Repair.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-03T15:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JvB5AL59fM", "description": "This is the full version of \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\" aka The Banana Splits Theme as performed by Liz Phair and Material Issue for the Saturday Morning Cartoons' Greatest Hits music and video project.

Jake's life is upended when his shifty, rogue of a father, LEIF - an absentee parent and a man who best days as a travel writer are well past him-- insists that Jake help him with his next project, a book about Algonquin Park. Agreeing to a temporary arrangement, father and son arrive at the long-neglected family cabin in the woods, a tranquil backdrop to their fractious relationship. But bickering and bad feelings are soon cut short by an unexpected tragedy Laying his father to rest along with the man's many secrets, Jake decides to finish the book as a gesture to the father he barely knew. Back at the cabin, Jake's work is interrupted by unexpected visitors: a mother and child. CARMEN and IGGY are revealed to be grieving members of Leif's secret family. For Jake, this deception seems to be the final straw. All he wants to do is pack up and leave. However something stops him. Iggy, just an eleven-year-old boy, has an uncanny amount of information about an event from Jake's childhood involving a horseshoe that he views as pivotal in his life and for the book. Can these two brothers, having just met, come together on an unlikely quest that may just help them both find what they're looking for and so badly need? ALGONQUIN is a story about family secrets, second chances, and discovering the bonds that connect us through our families having nothing to do with luck.\n\nAlgonquin \"Algonquin movie\" \"Algonquin trailer\" family childhood adult \"Algonquin Park\" writer cabin \"Jonathan Hayes\" \"Mark Rendall\" \"Nicholas Campbell\" \"Sheila McCarthy\" jslewis", "title": "Algonquin Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Mark Rendall Drama HD", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T21:19:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K3zN7K2HRE", "description": "2013\ub144 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ucd08\uc5f0 \"\ud558\uc774\uc2a4\ucfe8\ubba4\uc9c0\uceec\" \uc744 \uc544\uc9c1 \ub9cc\ub098\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud32c\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud558\uc774\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc601\uc0c1 \uacf5\uac1c!   \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 1\ub2ec\uc758 \uae30\ud68c \ub193\uce58\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694.\n\n Troy :  Ryeowook (Super Junior), Jaejin (FTisland), Kang Dong-ho\n\n Gabriella : Luna( F(x) ), Choa(AOA), Oh So-yeon  \n\n  2013. 7.2 ~ 9.1 @\ube14\ub8e8\uc2a4\ud018\uc5b4 \uc0bc\uc131\uce74\ub4dc\ud640\n\n\ud2f0\ucf13\uc608\ub9e4 \u261e  http://www.cjenmticket.com\n\uacf5\uc5f0 \uc815\ubcf4 \u261e http://highschool.interest.me\n\n To book a Ticket \u261e http://www.cjenmticket.com/\n  For more info \u261e http://www.facebook.com/cjenmmusicals", "title": "\"\ud558\uc774\uc2a4\ucfe8\ubba4\uc9c0\uceec(HighSchool Musical)\" \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uba74 - \ub824\uc6b1,\uc774\uc7ac\uc9c4,\ub8e8\ub098,\ucd08\uc544, \uac15\ub3d9\ud638,\uc624\uc18c\uc5f0", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T00:36:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K4BvF_sb3Y", "description": "T.V.

How does port forwarding work? Answers to these questions will be explained in this video using a simple network that contains a computer and IP security camera.\n\nPort forwarding, sometimes referred to as port triggering, is a process of configuring a router to make a computer or network device that is connected to it accessible to other computers and network devices from outside of the local network. Port forwarding uses an IP address plus port number to route network requests to specific devices.\n\nGenerally, when you enable port forwarding for a device, you are turning on remote Internet access.\n\nIf you want to setup a network device to be accessed from remotely over the Internet, chances are need to setup port forwarding on your router to do so. This applies whether you want to enable remote Internet access for an IP camera, surveillance DVR, gaming server, or any other network device on a local area network.\n\nFor additional information about how port forwarding is used in video surveillance systems, instructions for specific router manufacturers, as well as setup and troubleshooting tools for desktop and mobile, please visit this page. \n\nhttp://cctvcamerapros.com/port-forwarding", "title": "What is Port Forwarding?", "publishedDate": "2014-04-18T16:31:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K6nhwfnKMI", "description": "Prestigioso appartamento ammobiliato (si presta anche ad eventuali modifiche)  fitto a modico prezzo mensile ideale  per famiglie lavoratori e studenti contatto mail paparestapio@gmail.com", "title": "via ugo la malfa Foggia", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T19:15:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K6rChQ-gnk", "description": "This video introduces the complex anatomy related to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a painful and common condition of the hand.\n\nNote that these films contain images and video that some viewers may find disturbing.", "title": "Clinical Anatomy - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "publishedDate": "2011-11-30T11:53:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K7n2s2Iemw", "description": "controlando su expansion.", "title": "podando vallisneria", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T15:11:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K7u3-qWKsM", "description": "Bartlett's Whizbang chicken plucker", "title": "Bartlett's Whizbang chicken plucker", "publishedDate": "2012-05-30T13:24:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K80GNhACeo", "description": "Lifting a full 31 cubic meter bulk bin onto a new volvo hook lift truck in Melbourne Vic\n\nDeceased Estate Clearance Melbourne\nProperty clean up, contents removal, clean and property improvement for sale. \n\nwww.aamion.com", "title": "bulk bin in and out with a 31meter bulk waste bin hook lift truck", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T01:54:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K82FEe10MI", "description": "We may be on the brink of being able to clone a woolly mammoth.

Later he was transferred to Patrai and thence to Preveza, where he shot himself (July 20, 1928).\n\nKaryotakis' two volumes of poetry show the influence of the New School of Poetry of Athens, founded in about 1880 by Kostis Palamas, which revolted against Katharevusa, the stilted and archaic official language of Greece, and against the emotionalism of the Romantics.

It can save your life. What you wanna do to practice treading water is put your fingers together. This is called sculling. You're going to press your fingers and your hands back and forth. And you can do this in the shallow end of the pool before you go into the deep water. The second step of treading water is your legs and your feet. You want to flutter kick your feet and the way you do this, I have to sit down for this one, but you're here and you're gonna kick and scull your hands at the same time and that will keep your head above the water. Treading water is also used as an exercise in the deep water. Usually everyone wears a belt but you can do it without a belt. What you wanna do is tread and kick your legs as fast as you can for about a minute then you can rest, do it again for a minute, rest. And I would do it about three times. This exercise is really good because it gets your heart rate going, it's really good for your cardiovascular health and it burns a lot of calories. So treading water is definitely a great thing to learn.", "title": "How to Tread Water | Water Aerobics", "publishedDate": "2012-09-01T13:15:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KBN8A6CsDc", "description": "just my review of Nature's Bounty 5000 mcgs of biotin and how it worked for me :)", "title": "biotin 5000 mcg review", "publishedDate": "2013-09-03T16:16:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KBUZ-GR3xg", "description": "", "title": "Parjanya", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T22:29:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KC7VdDbijg", "description": "Very interesting doco.

I decided to make one of my own -- back to the company that originally called me.\n\nA man named Bruce answered and told me he could help me renew my warranty, but also tried to talk me out of calling General Motors and asking them about my factory warranty. He then also told me that GM would try to downplay my need to buy an extended warranty because then they could get more of my hard earned money. In fact, Bruce even told me GM purposely engineered the parts they sell to break down precisely when an owner's warranty runs out.\n\nAccording to the Better Business Bureau and just about every scam tracking website we could find -- these offers are at best, not worth your time or money. Some may be legitimate but probably won't end up covering the sort of repairs to your car that would warrant the price you pay for the so called extended warranty.\n\nIf I haven't sold you on the fact that this is a scam -- consider this. The gentleman I spoke to on the phone told me - the way he knew my warranty was up was because his company worked with every auto manufacturer in the country and every auto repair shop in the country. EVERY SINGLE ONE! Now how many calls do you think it took to find out that wasn't at all true?

Why are you lying?\"\n\nYou know, lying is something that really gets under our skin, because it taps off of our own personal beliefs about being respectful to one another, if you will. But lying, by definition, is actually \u201crefusal.\" It's refusal to tell the truth.\n\nI don't want to have to get into it with a kid and go back and forth about yes you did, no you didn't, yes you did, no you didn't. Because in most cases, we know they're lying. What I want them to do is to see the value of owning their own behavior\u2026\n\n\"Rachel, when you don't tell the truth, they call it lying. You know that. Lying is really refusal, refusing to tell the truth. The best thing you can do right now is to take the stuff that you have of Billy's and just put it right back in his desk.\"\n\nI once had a cellphone taken from my desk. I had a feeling I knew who did it, but if I confronted him, he would have lied. So instead I asked the whole class. I said, \"You know, sometimes, people have to make a phone call. Whoever borrowed my phone to make that phone call yesterday, could you just please make sure you return it to the top drawer of the file cabinet by tomorrow morning, and that would be much appreciated.\"\n\nWell, you know, that phone did show up in the file cabinet the next morning, and what it did was it gave the child a chance to save himself. Just by returning the phone was admission that he had taken it in the first place, and we didn't have to go to battle over lying, did do it, didn't do it, didn't do it, did do it.\n\nI find that children are more afraid of further repercussions when they lie, so giving them a chance to make it better on their own helps them to own that behavior.", "title": "Lying in school\u2014one way to handle it", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T13:24:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KHqqZr7HOw", "description": "Wolfgang Gartner - Space Junk from Ultra Music.\nBuy the single here: http://goo.gl/eNhmj\nWolfgang Gartner T-shirts here: http://goo.gl/chQnc\n\nUltra Music is one step ahead in the world of dance music and is a leading independent electronic label.

She got her break in 1960, left university and started touring in the States.\n\n''I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.''\n\nGrief over theft\nWhat followed were those six albums, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and settled in the city the following year.\n\n\nLost Ladies of Folk\nShe recorded just this one album for Argo, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew), followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues, retrospectives and compilations.\n\nShe had in fact called it quits ''I didnt feel I was growing, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that, I wasnt. So I thought I'll go back and get my degree.'' Once back in the university world, she stayed, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College, London.\n\nIn 2007, 28 years after she made her UK debut there, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk ( featuring also Susan Christie and Wendy Flower) night as part of his Meltdown curatorship.

Poco se sabe con certeza de la vida de esta sevillana y sin embargo ha hecho leyenda. Se afirma, por ejemplo, que no queriendo resignarse a una vida limitada a la casa y los labores decidi\u00f3 travestirse e ingres\u00f3 a la universidad para estudiar mitolog\u00eda Griega , su gran pasi\u00f3n y no fue hasta tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, que su verdadera identidad fue revelada al enamorarse de un compa\u00f1ero con quien luego contraer\u00eda matrimonio. As\u00ed lo menciona Lope en su 'Laurel de Apolo' donde relata la historia de una dama travestida: \"Mintiendo su nombre,/ Y transformada en hombre,/ Oy\u00f3 Filosof\u00eda,/ Y por curiosidad Astrolog\u00eda. (...) Y de aquella cient\u00edfica Academia/ Mereci\u00f3 los laureles con que premia;/ No de otra suerte que a Plat\u00f3n divino/ Aquella celebrada Mantinea,/ Que en forma de var\u00f3n a Grecia vino\". A sus dos hermanas confinadas a un convento dedic\u00f3 esta obra \"para que os divirt\u00e1is represent\u00e1ndola con vuestras compa\u00f1eras de claustro\" Es de alguna forma una denuncia a trav\u00e9s del humor la discriminaci\u00f3n y la hipocres\u00eda de una sociedad que muchas veces juzga y condena lo que no se atreve a hacer.\n\n Los entreactos son una desopilante ant\u00edtesis del mundo en que la autora viv\u00eda; \"todo es all\u00ed lo contrario a lo que debe ser; ...un estallido de lo reprimido bajo la m\u00e1scara de lo grotesco. Lo que no se puede hacer, lo que no se puede si quiera pensar, es posible alrededor de Baco Poltr\u00f3n y sus Gracias mohosas.\" En esta obra, perfectamente esperp\u00e9ntica, absurda y bufonesca, donde, como quer\u00eda Valle Incl\u00e1n, el mundo de lo ideal y perfecto se ve reflejado en espejos deformantes, reina un optimismo a toda prueba. Los personajes, horrendos y rid\u00edculos sin excepci\u00f3n, se sienten hermosos, atractivos y logran sin esfuerzo seducir, enamorar, amar, perdonar y descubrir la belleza a\u00fan en la m\u00e1s absoluta fealdad . El lenguaje no es ajeno al planteamiento general. La autora se libera tambi\u00e9n en este aspecto de ataduras y convencionalismos. Por momentos poco importa la l\u00f3gica o la estructura.

First I was a bit upset but quickly remembered that I was going to see my beautiful girlfriend again in a few moments' time. \n\nGetting out of the bed, I walked into the bathroom and showered quickly before fixing my hair and getting dressed. \n\nOnce I was done, I found a note from my mom saying that she had to be at work earlier today. Sighing a bit, I decided for a bowl of cereal which I first quickly poured and then ate and afterward went upstairs again to brush my teeth and do last touch ups. \n\nJust as I was walking downstairs again, the door bell rang I sprinted down the last steps, opening the door and seeing my baby standing there. \n\nShe looked so beautiful like always and had a smile on her face which took my breath away. \n\n\"Morning handsome\" she greeted me, her smile only growing at the sight of me. \"Hey babe\" I responded and kissed her sweetly. \n\n\"Ready to go?\" she asked while pulling away, licking her lips, savoring the taste of our kiss. \"Yeah, let's go\" I said as I swung my backpack over my shoulder and stepped out, next to her, locking the door. \n\nAfter I had taken her hands and interlocked our fingers, I looked down at her and couldn't help but press my lips on hers firmly once again, enjoying the feeling of her soft lips on mine. \n\nSmiling into the kiss, she kissed back for a bit before she pulled away and rested her forehead against mine \"What was that for?\" she asked while biting her lip. \"I just felt like it\" I smirked back and put one hand on her waist, pulling her to me. \n\n\"I hope you get that feeling more often\" she giggled and pecked my lips. She was so adorable and I smiled before leading her to her car, where we both got in and she started the car with a loud growl and smile plastered itself on her face.\n\n She loved driving fast and I couldn't believe my luck with this girl. Most females were careful drivers and nagged on their boyfriend for their driving but she wasn't like that at all. \n\nWe arrived at school faster than when I would have driven and she swiftly parked the car without adjusting a single time. \"Impressive\" I said while wolf-whistling. \n\nSmirking, she said \"You haven't seen anything yet, babe\" and winked before gliding out of the car. Damn, I love this girl. \n\nSeeing the other guys undressing her with their eyes, I knew I had to get the point across that she was mine now, so I leaned next to her and laid my arm around her shoulder, pulling her to my side and pressed my lips against her temple. \n\nMost of the guys turned away so I was satisfied and looked at my watch, seeing that we still had plenty of time before school started. \n\n\"What are we waiting for?\" I asked after a few moments, growing more and more curious. Smiling and nodding to the car that just pulled onto the parking lot, she said simply \"Her.\" \n\nThe car which was a silver metallic Audi, glided in the parking spot next to hers and Miley got out, walking to us while locking the car. \"Hey boo\" she spoke and hugged Selena before moving on to me saying \"Hey Justin.\" \n\nI hugged back and said \"Hey\". Pulling away from me again, she asked \"Where are the other two?\". \"They should be here any minute.\" I responded while checking the time. \n\nAs if on queue, I saw Austin and Zayn walking towards us, both of them laughing and boxing each other. My dorky friends. \n\nShaking my head while laughing, they approached us and said \"Morning guys\". I noticed how Austin was looking at Miley and I knew right there that we totally had the hots for her. Once we were through with the hugs and bro shakes, Austin said \"Come on, guys. Let's get this day over with\". All of us nodded in agreement and walked towards the main entrance.\n\nSmiling at the fact how awesome my life was right now, I grabbed Selena's hand, pulling her to my side where she leaned against me lightly and we followed the others. Our ways separated and we arranged to meet for lunch again. Miley, Zayn and Austin walked the other way, leaving me and Selena behind. We walked to my locker first, where I got out everything I needed before I turned to her and smiled at this beauty. \n\n\"What?\" she asked while chuckling. \"Nothing, you are just so beautiful, babe.\" \n\n\"Oh hush up\" she waved off while blushing and looking away. \n\nStepping closer to her, I moved my fingers under her chin, lifting it up while looking deeply into her chocolate eyes. \n\n\"I mean every word I say, baby\" I whispered before kissing her softly. She gave in and kissed back for a bit before pulling away with a smile on her face. \n\n\"Thanks Jay\" she smiled and laid her forehead against mine. \"Anytime\" I replied and pecked her lips again, causing her to giggle. Damn, she had a cute laugh. \n\nUnfortunately it was time for class again, meaning we had to separate as much as we didn't want to.\n\n---\nNaw, drooling over my own writing ;D\nDon't worry though, it won't get dramaless ;D", "title": "Hopelessly Devoted - Twenty-Six", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T21:13:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KVP7KomJQw", "description": "Album: Rote Augen 2009\nMain Imperium", "title": "GPC - Rote Augen", "publishedDate": "2009-10-14T19:54:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KVxyQzP0-o", "description": "What's up guys Kzh here presenting you another Sick episode if you Guys enjoyed please leave a like and comment and be sure to  Suscribe.\n\nPlayer: https://www.youtube.com/user/YooKyzh\nEditor: https://www.youtube.com/user/TouchOfTheAngel\nPlayer: Zuse_Kzno", "title": "Zuse Kzh & Zuse Kzno | Elaboration #1", "publishedDate": "2014-05-07T16:36:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KWmbUBa-ZE", "description": "No Te Olvides De Suscribirte;D\nUnete:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rapper-NationNacion-de-Raperos/281445985202171?fref=ts", "title": "Los Presos De Guantanamo Nuestros Habitos  Video Official", "publishedDate": "2012-05-03T02:17:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KWmhMav00M", "description": "Pranks Are Getting Way Too Real: The Bomb Prank!

While people suffer from depression for a variety of different reasons, one thing is certain - they all want to find a cure for depression. Dealing with depression on a daily basis is frustrating and debilitating, and so many people are treated, but long for something that provides them with a long term cure.\n\nFor most people, depression is something that is temporary, although others may suffer from it long term. Many doctors out there prescribe medications, such as antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and more. The problem is, while these drugs may be able to provide some short term relief from depression, they usually don't take care of the underlying problem, meaning the relief will not last.\n\nWhat people really want is a cure for depression that will last for good. In order to actually cure this problem, you have to treat the underlying problem, not just the symptoms. For this reason natural treatments have been developed to help finally treat depression in an effective way.\n\nOne of the main problems with medications for depression treatment, other than the fact they don't always work, is the side effects that they can cause. Some of the side effects that come along with these drugs can almost be as bad as the problem that patients are dealing with. No one wants to add negative side effects to their depression, which is why so many people are interested in natural options that will offer a cure for depression.\n\nYou don't have to deal with side effects from drugs that don't provide you with a real cure. Instead of going with doctor prescribed drugs, you may want to try looking into natural options and all they have to offer you. With the natural options out there, you can finally get relief without side effects, and it won't be a short term relief. These natural treatments are able to provide you with a cure that lasts.\n\nInstead of wasting money on drugs and therapy all the time, it may be worth your while to check into natural alternative options that offer a cure for depression. There are many benefits to enjoy, and most of these treatments are reasonably priced. If you are tired of dealing with depression, why not give it a try. The cure may be just around the corner for you.\n\nFor more info, please visit http://endyourdepression.gethow.info", "title": "Cure For Depression - End Depression For Good- Natural Treatment for Depression and Anxiety", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T23:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KXCHULLROE", "description": "http://www.sixpackfactory.com : The dumbbell leg pull-in works the lower abdominal area.  \nThe specific muscle that is being targeted is the rectus abdominus.\nTo perform the DB Leg Pull-In you must lie on your back and lift your upper legs to 90 degrees with your knees bent.

Rajiv Brigade and Opposition Congress and Chhattisgarh Swabhiman Manch, a regional party, lodged a complaint with the Election Commission on Monday demanding action against Yoga Guru Ramdev for his alleged violation of the Model Code of Conduct in the poll-bound state.\n\nRamdev has been visiting several parts of Chhattisgarh as a part of his voter awareness campaign aimed at sensitising people to exercise their franchise.\n\n\"We have received complaints based on three points by the Chhattisgarh Swabhiman Manch against Ramdev,\" Chief Electoral Officer Sunil Kujur told reporters this evening.\n\nIn its complaint, the party alleged that Ramdev was considered a state guest and provided government facilities even after implementation of the Model Code of Conduct.\n\nBesides, he has also been campaigning for the ruling BJP in the state, Kujur said.\n\nHowever, he said that all such special government facilities to Ramdev were removed from his protocol after the model code of conduct came into force on October 4, in the wake of declaration of election schedule for five states, including Chhattisgarh.\n\n\"After implementation of the model code of conduct, Ramdev is not being treated as a state guest. He has been provided lodging facilities at a government guest house from a security point of view. Any person who has 'Z' or above 'Z' class security cover, is given this facility,\" Kujur said.\n\n\"His speech is being recorded and monitored. We will see video recordings of his public address to check whether he is campaigning for any political party or not and take further action,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress also complained to the Election Commission against Ramdev in this connection.\n\n\"Ramdev has been campaigning for the BJP in the state in the name of creating awareness among voters. He makes derogatory and unconstitutional remarks against the Prime Minister and national leaders, which is a clear cut violation of the model code of conduct,\" Congress spokesperson Mahendra Chhabra alleged.\n\nRamdev has been provided government facilities to run his campaign, which is sheer misuse of public money for campaigning in favour of the ruling BJP, he alleged.\n\nThe Congress has requested Election Commission to take cognisance of the issue and lodge a case against Ramdev and the BJP in this connection, Chhabra said.", "title": "Sanjeev Agrawal lodge complaint against Baba Ramdev", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T05:08:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K_0BqnZIPw", "description": "Jook1 -Best Believe\nProd: Tunnel No5\nDirected By The Sandman\n\nJook1 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/jook-the-first\nJook1 Twitter: https://twitter.com/JooktheFirst\n\n\nThe Sandman Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SnappsTheSandman", "title": "Jook1- Best Believe (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T23:04:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K_37PDbhYQ", "description": "This is a time-lapse collection of pictures that shows the the visual facilitator working live during the Supply Chain Insights Global Summit held in Scottsdale, AZ on September 10-11, 2014.", "title": "Visual Facilitator - time-lapse taken at Supply Chain Insights' Global Summit 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T05:04:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K_Jvb9vX8E", "description": "Axial CT Scan: elongated and tortuous basilar artery", "title": "Axial CT Scan: elongated and tortuous basilar artery", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T21:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K_qTm2nu7I", "description": "http://www.eclecticmethod.net", "title": "Eclectic Method - The Ride", "publishedDate": "2013-12-03T11:46:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-K_x5gtpJ14", "description": "The tough economic times are hitting young job seekers hard.

Interruption of the blood supply, for example by a blockage or a leak, can cause a stroke. A stroke can cause significant damage to the area of the brain that was starved of its blood supply. Sometimes a single stroke is enough to cause symptoms of dementia. In other cases, a person may experience a series of smaller strokes that gradually cause more damage.\n\nVascular dementia can also be caused by small vessel disease which is due to damage to the tiny blood vessels deep in the brain. \n\nSince vascular dementia is closely linked to a healthy blood supply, scientists think that lifestyle factors such as regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight could help to reduce the risk of this form of dementia.\"\n\n\nPlease watch our other videos to see how brain cells function, hear what dementia is, and to hear more about Alzheimer's disease, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia and other rarer causes of dementia. \n\nAlzheimer's Society is dedicated to defeating dementia through research. Our unique research programme funds research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of dementia to improve treatment for people today and to search for a cure for tomorrow.\n\nWe are the only organisation to work with leading scientists and people affected by dementia to ensure our research influences practice and transforms lives.

I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs and have appeared in many music videos. You can find more information about me and my career, as well as photos and videos, at www.dgtnyc.com. I'm going to be talking to you about ballet. Stretching in ballet is an important part to warming up, and also to increase your flexibility. You want to trigger parts of your body that you're going to be using in class. So, starting off with your hamstrings, you can flex your feet and make sure that your heels are off the ground, and you're going to grab onto your heels, and you're going to just bend all the way down, and hang there. And you're going to feel a nice pull in the back of your legs, and you wanna stay in every stretch that you do for about thirty seconds. If you stay any shorter than that, your muscles aren't able to relax, and they won't fully stretch. You also should be warming up your hips, and this can be done by gently pressing on either side. And you can change the position of your legs from being far away, to having your toes very closely depending on what you need for your hips. And so you can do a flat back, which is just your body bending over slightly, or you can round your back completely. You should also think about opening up your hips a little further by doing a straddle. And make sure that you're not rolling over onto your knee when you're doing this. Make sure that your feet are pointed and your legs are out to the side. And you can slowly just go all the way forward, or stretch to the side, whatever you feel that you need. Another good idea, to stretch the outside of your legs, is to do this stretch, where you can hold onto your knee, and you can turn your body to the side, and that's a great stretch to do. In addition, a lot of dancers have a lot of tension in their IT band, so a good way to stretch that is to bring your foot up, and you want to slightly sickle your foot. And if you sit up nice and tall, and if you just rotate your body a little bit, you will feel a very painful pull in that muscle, but it is definitely okay and it should be worked on a regular basis. It's important that you don't overstretch. If you overstretch you could pull or tear some muscles, which would be very, very dangerous.", "title": "How to Stretch Properly | Ballet Dance", "publishedDate": "2011-10-28T18:32:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Kx6UWwabK0", "description": "", "title": "Palmyra House Siren", "publishedDate": "2011-09-12T01:23:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Kx9iwXNmXU", "description": "High Speed Tire and Wheel Force Variation (Uniformity) Production Machine.

Individuals with hot feet should convert it into a priority to buy shoes that will enable comfort for foot.  How you're breathing right at that moment determines how you'll be perceived.  And it's actually not since of some secret black-box formula that Market Samurai makes usage of everything Market Samurai does is entirely transparent and rational.  For instance, should it be  inexpensive, that doesn't mean it's lower in quality and vice versa.  \n\nNow I'm not saying you must forget your primary goal of getting your boyfriend or girlfriend back.  Somehow, I found that may be conditioned myself to stop sweating as opposed to shocking it into submission.  Look for sunglasses having a label saying the glasses block 99 to 100 percent with the sun's rays.  For one, you have to understand that any sort of sweat will be the body's method of cooling itself down.  There can also be things you could add to the present list like sex, emotional connection, a sense of belonging, etc.  \n\nHowever, some safeguards need to maintain place to defend against acne that may result from the exercise routines.  Wearing cotton socks that permit airflow forces you to feel a lot more comfortable.  It is a lot easier if the ice is around the surface and you are able to see it.  Once it truly is ready grab the dish out on the oven and sprinkle some cut fresh rosemary and marjoram for the top.  Sweating is effected because of your age, gender, genetics, environment and fitness level.  \n\nDip a cloth or sponge into cooled sage tea after which apply it on the problematic skin.  One final word on perspiration and sweat odor: witchhazel.  Maybe you could test sleeping naked, without pajamas that's, so that the body is not restricted along with your body heat isn't trapped in this type of close layer of clothing.  Exercising inside heat isn't going to have to become dangerous as we follow certain precautions.  What more do they really ask for when there can be a choice of colors and prints inside the fabric that active and yoga practitioners prefer.  \n\nIf we carefully look at every one of the external factors they may be totally under our control, we could definitely workout a way where you can adopt a lifestyle that may be healthy and peaceful.  The process is actual surgery that's performed on your own back, so a surgeon must either clamp, singe, or snip the nerve in charge of ordering the sweat glands within the palms and soles to generate sweat.  Continual change and constant improvement could be exhausting.  Winners will likely be announced your day following the chat inside comment thread.  Sage actually starts to work to control sweating typically within a couple of hours, which enable it to last for a couple of days in minimizing or eliminating sweat.  \n\n\"Night sweats in bed\" - http://youtu.be/-KxKmiEF7R4", "title": "Night Sweats in Bed - Stop Night Sweating in Bed at Night", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T00:02:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KxbcQiLzFc", "description": "", "title": "16- Posterior intercostal veins", "publishedDate": "2012-02-03T11:57:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-KyBq_Cb01I", "description": "UNFAIR: EXPOSING THE IRS is a feature-length documentary revealing the truth about the cover-ups and the abuses of power at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nWe traveled across the country to interview politicians, community organizers, and the victims at the heart of the IRS' abuse.

You're watching ClevverMusic, here's your first Idol Cap of Season 12! The season kicked off with a chilling performance from last season's winner Phillip Phillips performing his hit song \"Home\" and celebrated his mainstream success since the show ended. We then are introduced to this season's judges: returning judge Randy Jackson, followed by three new judges Country superstar Keith Urban, hip hop songstress Nicki Minaj, and the legend Mariah Carey. We saw auditions kick off in New York, where 1000's of hopefuls showed up to audition or just get a glimpse at the judges. The show started off a rocky with the four judges all talking over each other and bickering about who is a bigger fan of the movie \"Mean Girls\" (what a perfect reference). We see the first catfight happen when before the first audition Mariah comments on Nicki's hat, \"We can have accessories? I didn't know that was allowed.\" On that note, take a look at the first audition which was just as rocky as the panel.\n\nThe Nicki-Mariah catfight continued when a contestant praised Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas\" as the best Christmas song and Nicki said under her breath, \"She's a bitch\". Yikes. The second auditioneer, a former Camp Mariah attendee Tenna T. shows up bringing Mariah photos of them together in the 90's. When it came to Tenna auditioning, Mariah said, \"I'd rather look at pictures of myself!\" Ah, we love you Mariah. Check out Tenna's performance, it was actually pretty good and made Mariah proud.\n\nA new feature of the show was revealed in the premiere: people can nominate others to try out if they are too bashful to do it themselves. Randy went to surprise one contestant with an audition and we can't help but think of 'The Voice' who does something similar to that. But alas, the hopeful wasn't even sent through to the next round.\n\nDay 2 in New York saw the judges being pretty harsh on the contestants and we saw British accents take over the show. It started with Nicki Minaj who randomly talks with an accent when she's nervous and was contagious for Mariah. All in all, there was a ton of bickering, but we kinda liked it. At the end of the show Nicki said, \"I feel like we gel well\" regarding the new judge panel. But what do you think? Will you keep watching this season?

An Authorization request first emerges whenever a cardholder attempts to purchase a good or service through a debit or credit card.\n\nThe request for Authorization is first sent through the merchant's acquiring bank to determine the cardholder's bank. When notified, the cardholder's bank then determines whether the transaction with the merchant will either be approved or declined based on the cardholder's line of credit. After the acquiring bank clarifies whether the cardholder holds sufficient funds or credit for the transaction, this information of whether the transaction was declined or approved travels back through the acquiring bank to the merchant. If the transaction is approved, then the amount of the transaction is deducted from the cardholder's account and the cardholder is given receipt.", "title": "\"What is a Credit Card Authorization?\" \u2014 2Checkout E-Commerce Glossary", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T18:14:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-LB1LtlLm-4", "description": "", "title": "animasi sifat koligatif larutan penurunan tekanan uap", "publishedDate": "2014-01-25T04:36:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-LBCp689DTI", "description": "Pr\u00f3ba z\u0142apania Bonusa na konferencji prasowej przed gal\u0105 NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS kt\u00f3ra odb\u0119dzie si\u0119 19 kwietnia...", "title": "Czy Bonus BGC udzieli jeszcze wywiadu dla Pakol TV??", "publishedDate": "2014-03-29T17:16:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-LBMHo2RJAs", "description": "Water gauge sensor, Lights up and buzzes when there is no water in the gauge.

By this we do not mean coins that are themselves magnets, rather we refer to real coins that can be picked up using a magnet. Normally this means that the coin is made of steel, even though it may have a thin coating of copper, cupro-nickel, or other metal or alloy. In the UK, the 1p and 2p coins are made of steel, and 5p and 10p coins dated 2011 onwards are also magnetic. Many countries have coins which are magnetic, although at the time of writing, none of the coins in the US are magnetic. \n\nThe magnetic nature of the coins allows all kinds of tricks to be performed. Many of these tricks were devised by the Magic Penny Trust, who have been producing the 'Magic Penny Kit' for many years. For the two demonstrations shown here, we have used the two magnets that come included with the Magic Penny Kit.

After providing a detailed introduction to transgenderism, Ms. Keppler discusses in depth the status and identity issues that transgenders face. She goes over the challenges of changing identification documents and the implications of the Defense of Marriage Act.  Ms. Keppler also examines the unique marriage and estate planning challenges that transgenders face (such as creating wills, designating beneficiaries, assigning health care proxies, and designating guardians of minor children) and what attorneys can do to overcome them. This course is intended for estate planning attorneys who would like to learn about how to properly conduct estate planning for transsexual clients.", "title": "\"Planning Considerations for the Transsexual Client,\" Caryn Keppler", "publishedDate": "2011-12-15T17:41:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-LZ-WYUMXlk", "description": "Ive just purchased my 1st bonsai ive trimmed it and put the wire round some areas to train, what you reckon im new to the bonsai world any tips etc would be great, trying to train it outdoor.", "title": "My bonsai tree larch, larix, , learner", "publishedDate": "2013-05-13T18:00:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-LZ42PQFAIA", "description": "Killer Instinct Xbox One All Ultra Combos, Killer Instinct All Intros, Killer Instinct All Victory Poses this is all from DAY ONE when Killer Instinct was first released.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n \nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

No sewing required!\n\n\nStep 1: Make a template\nLay a pair of small underwear, like a bikini or a thong, on a piece of parchment paper and trace the outline of both sides of the undies, leaving a little extra room on the bottom of each side for the crotch. Cut out the templates and place them flat on top of another larger piece of parchment paper. \n\nStep 2: Soften the candy\nMicrowave caramels or fruit chewies, in 20 second increments, until they are soft, but not melting, taking care not to overcook them. How many you'll need depends on the size of your underwear. \n\nStep 3: Put candy on template\nPress the softened candies about a quarter-inch apart on all but the top inch of the template; use latex gloves and a spatula if you find the goo too hot to handle. Then flatten the candies out with a rolling pin so there's no space between them. Work quickly: The candy re-hardens fast!\n\nTip\nIf the candy hardens before you can smooth it all out, pop it back in the microwave for just a few seconds to re-soften. \n\nStep 4: Join together\nUnravel the twist-and-pull candy so you have shoelace-thin strands; these will be the laces that tie the two sides of your undies together. Lay one string at the top corner of each panty side, with about an inch of the string on the panty, and the rest hanging loose at the sides. \n\nStep 5: Soften more candy\nSoften more candy and press it over the one-inch border you left at the top of each side of panty, taking care to cover the string candy overlap so it becomes attached to the undies. Using a different color candy for this border is a nice touch. \n\nStep 6: Attach the crotch\nNow attach the crotch ends to each other with more softened candy. Trim any excess candy off the sides with scissors, and let the undies harden.\n\nTip\nGive the undies fancy borders by trimming the perimeter with scissors that have a decorative edge. \n\nStep 7: Lace it up\nWhen you're ready to don your undies, carefully peel the parchment paper away and tie each side with the candy strings. Now just be careful not to get your knickers in a twist! \n\nDid You Know?\nIn 1981, Frederick's of Hollywood became the first American lingerie store to carry thong underwear.", "title": "How to Make Edible Undies", "publishedDate": "2010-02-05T13:01:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-M0ZlsI0v5E", "description": "nezapomenutelny koncert skupiny mako!mako, video bohuzel bez blesku, i kdyz v tomto pripade myslim neni treba..", "title": "mako!mako", "publishedDate": "2007-09-28T00:59:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-M0tnmKS-YU", "description": "To purchase or to get more information regarding the Brunswick Mastermind Genius please click on the following - http://www.bowling.com/products/brunswick-mastermind-genius.htm", "title": "Check Out The Mastermind Genius! by Brunswick", "publishedDate": "2014-01-10T21:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "-M0uSw2Tg1A", "description": "Just a beta test.

So, basically, you can use dumbbells or you can just use nothing. If you want to, you can put your hands on your hips, put them behind your head. Or, if you're against a wall, you can use a wall or a chair for stability. \n\nSo, basically, you're going to have hands by your side if you're using dumbbells, and you're going to lift up onto the balls of your feet. So, lift up, squeeze the calves, and down. So, make sure while you're doing this that you're keeping your shoulders back, your core is tight, and you're standing straight, nice and tall. Alright.\n\nWe don't want any rounding. We want to come up, hold for about one, two seconds, and then just come down. We're doing this for about 15 to 20 reps, and by the time you hit 15 you should definitely be feeling a burn. And when you do this, I would do probably two to three sets of 12 to 15 reps. If you go up to 20 and feel the burn, that's even better. \n\nAnother variation of the standing calf raise is if you have a box at home or a step, you could even use the stairs. Basically, you get even more of a full range of motion if you're standing on a step. So, as you come up on a step, you come down and your heels are slightly going to go lower than the floor. So, that gives you even more of an angle to come up and more of a squeeze. So, you can add that. It just makes it more advanced. \n\nSo, up and down, just like that. But you can use a step or a box or whatever you have at home, or at the gym. And it just makes it even more advanced so you get even more of a burn. And there you go. That's a great toning exercise called the standing calf raise.", "title": "How to Do a Calf Raise | Sexy Legs Workout", "publishedDate": "2012-08-05T15:14:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-M4DR2t75xw", "description": "The rules are simple: start running or \"running jumping\" through a guillotine trap continously over and over again without stopping and try to postpone the Prince's inevitable death!

He represents Romania in Eurovision Song Contest 2013, in Malm\u00f6, with the song It's My Life, music and lyrics by Cristian Faur.\n \nHe participated in many master classes with prestigious names of the music world, such as: Viorica Cortez, Jordi Savall, Sara Mingardo, Bobby McFerrin, Magda Olivero. Cezar is often invited to sing in the most important festivals and on well-known stages in the country as well as in Europe. He performed next to famous conductors like Fabio Biondi, Alan Curtis, Corrado Rovaris, Emanuelle Villaume, Ottavio Dantone, Diego Fasolis, Jean-Christophe Spinosi, Werner Ehrhardt, George Petrou, Sergio Ciomei, Sergio Azzolini, Nicolae Moldoveanu, Vlad Conta and Ketil Haugsand. His repertoire is very large, starting with vocal-symphonic music and up to a great variety of opera roles that he plays on the biggest stages in the world.\n\nBorn in 1980 la Ploie\u015fti, Romania, in a family of musicians, Cezar Ouatu started studying piano when he was six and graduated the piano and choir classes at Carmen Sylva Art High school, in his native town. In 1998 he started studying canto and baroque music and soon became well-known, due to his voice, natural legerity and less common vocal limits.\n\nIn 2001 he was accepted in the Giuseppe Verdi Music Academy in Milan, and in 2004 he graduated with maximum grades on the final exam at one of the most prestigious music academies in Europe. His first pop-opera single Cinema Paradiso was released on Christmas Eve, in 2012. For 2013, Cezar has already planned two international duets, with Andrea Bocelli and Angela Gherorghiu, as well as a single written especially for him by the legend of electronic music, Vangelis. Presently, Cezar works at his first pop-opera album The Voice, dedicated to love.\n\nIt's My Life is the second Eurovision entry for Cristian Faur, the Romanian composer and writer. His first one proved to be a successful choice, as he was the first Romanian composer whose song entered the top three in the Eurovision final -- that was in 2005, when Lumini\u0163a Anghel & Sistem's Let Me Try was highly appreciated by the public and jury.", "title": "Cezar - It's My Life (Romania) impression of second rehearsal", "publishedDate": "2013-05-11T21:15:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-M9P8esY7Jk", "description": "Don't plant the herb fennel.", "title": "Fennel Herb.

This sweet puppy lives a fabulous life in the East Village, NY.   She loves visiting the dog park and cuddle with her humans.  \n\nBella was so happy with the results after using our amazing Snout Soother that she decided to share this fun video with the world; this way other puppies could benefit from the multiples uses of Snout Soother.\n\nOur all natural balm for dogs helps prevent and treat several different conditions affecting dogs all over the world. Some of these conditions are: \n\n\u2022 Discoid Lupus in dogs\n\u2022 Hyperkeratosis in dogs\n\u2022 Puppy Acne \n\u2022 Canine Dry Eye \n\u2022 Dog Dry Nose \n\u2022 Crusty Dog Nose \n\u2022 Dry Paws\n\u2022 Dry Cracked Paws \n\u2022 Canine Dry Nose\n\u2022 Cracked Dog Nose\n\nA dog's nose is highly sensitive and can become very painful when their tissues are dry, chapped or cracked. No pet parent wants to see his or her beloved furry friend in pain or discomfort and Natural Dog Snout Soother can come to their rescue. \nSnout Soother is to dogs what Chapstick is to people. If you ask just about any American family what they use for chapped lips, they will show you their Chapstick. Now dog owners have their own product they can apply to their furry member's nose!Be wary of other products that contain fragrance - natural or not. We made the decision to NOT include scent in our formula. Humans love fragrance but dogs do not! Their extreme olfactory senses would smell garbage or other unmentionables. So, if you want a product that your dog won't turn his nose up literally, try Snout Soother. Your dog will thank you!\n\nSnout Soother is the perfect blend  of nourishing, healing and moisturizing ingredients that are100% natural, organic, vegan and cruelty free. Some of these amazing ingredients are:\n\n\u2022  Shea Butter\n\u2022 Organic Hempseed Oil\n\u2022 Kukui Nut Oil\n\u2022 Sweet Almond Oil\n\u2022 Rosemary Extract\n\u2022 Natural Vitamin E\n\u2022 Candelilla Wax\n\nCheck out just a few of our literally hundreds of reviews that can be found at www.NaturalDogCommpany.com. \n\nLuLu Bella: I use it on my heels when they are cracked . . .\n\"I got some Snout Soother for my 6 year old pug Lulu Bella. Her nose was very dry, and had a constant dry patch on it. It just looked like it was so painful. We started to use it regularly on her nose. She has grown to like the taste of the stuff. After I put it on she licks it, which is good, as she is just licking it in into her nose. If I get out my little tin can of Snout Smoother, she comes over to me, sits down, and looks at me . . . her dry patch is definitely a LOT smaller. Sometimes I use it on my heels when they are cracked and it works great. Both myself and Lulu are so thankful for Snout Soother We LOVE it.\"\n- Hester WheeltonYukon, Canada\n\n  \nHENRY: Discoid Lupus  \n\"Our sweet Henry. One day we noticed his nose was a pale pink color instead of it's normal black. We took him to the vet who informed us he has Discoid Lupus. When I got home, I immediately Googled the condition and found that his nose can actually start to swell, crack and bleed over time. I wanted to make sure this never happened to Henry. So in my research I found that systemic omegas were the way to go and there were some rave reviews about this Snout Soother. I was worried about putting something on Henry's nose as I knew he would lick it off. That's one of the things that are so awesome about Snout Soother; it is safe and all-natural so even if he does lick it off it won't hurt him. Without the pigment in his nose, skin cancer is a major concern for us; so another bonus is the natural sunscreen it has. This product has been an amazing life saver for our family as it keeps Henry's nose smooth, clean, and free of cracks and bleeding, and keeps Henry one happy dog! As the Snout Soother has been more a preventative measure for us, I don't have photos of what he would look like without the Soother, but I have seen dogs without using anything and it is very sad. However, I did get some before [photos] of him not having it on for about a week. His nose already started to show a sore, and looked very dry, swollen and discolored. You can see the immediate response after applying the Snout Soother. His nose isn't as swollen, the color improves, no cracks, the sore is gone, it's amazing. Not to mention the dirt it removes, as it is an emollient. Thank you so much for making this amazing product it has truly been a God-send for us and of course for Henry!\"\n\nUPDATE: \"Just wanted to tell you again what a difference it's made for us, usually in a dog with discoid lupus their noses are so sensitive you can't touch them but I can even give my baby kisses on the snout and he doesn't even flinch, thank you so much!\"\n- Jenniffer JonesYork, South Carolina\n\nAt Natural Dog we love dogs and are proud to help them everyday.

Some of them are quite complicated, and others, like this Thai omelet recipe (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a kai jeow moo sab), are easy to make. In fact, I think this is one of the easiest Thai recipes to make of all of them. All you really need are a couple of eggs, a few spoons of minced pork (or even chicken will works too), a splash of soy sauce, and oil for frying.\n\nNow an omelet is quite a world universal food, you can find it just about anywhere you are in the world, but a Thai omelet is distinctively different because it's not just a normal omelet, but it's a deep-fried omelette - that's right, in order to make it authentic, you've got to use a lot of oil. And the absolute key to this recipe is making sure your oil is exactly the right temperature so that your egg can cook perfectly.\n\nFor this recipe I'm going to use a sauce pan which is about 6 inches in diameter, but alternatively you could also use a frying pan or a wok. The reason I'm using a sauce pan, and why many street food vendors also make an omelet in a saucepan, is because it has walls and you can create a beautiful looking circular shaped omelet.\n\nThe first thing I like to do is put my sauce pan on the stove on medium-high heat and add about half a cup of oil in pan. It will take a couple of minutes to heat up, so that's why I heat it first and then prepare my eggs. To prepare your eggs, first crack two eggs into a small mixing bowl, and then add around 2 tablespoons of minced pork or minced chicken. Then add about 3/4 of a teaspoon of light soy sauce, and then start beating up your egg and pork mixture using a fork. You want to really beat up the egg hard using deep circular motions. This is a really important step because you want that egg to have lots of air in it, so that when you cook it, it's nice and fluffy and puffs up.\n\nWhen your oil is nice and hot and you can hear a little bit of sizzle, it's time to pour your egg mixture directly into the center of the oil in your sauce pan. As soon as you pour your egg in, it should immediately puff up like a pillow and cover your full saucepan. You want to cook your Thai omelet (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a kai jeow moo sab) for about 30 seconds on the first side and then flip it over. On the other side again you want to cook it for about 30 seconds or so, but just make sure you monitor it so that it doesn't burn. You can also use your spatula to sort of press on the egg to confirm that it's cooked all the way through - you want it to be for spongy, not runny.\n\nWhen your Thai omelet is ready, make sure you drain off all that excess oil, and your Thai street food omelet (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a kai jeow moo sab) is ready to be eaten. Make sure you have some hot fresh rice to serve it with, and in Thailand when you order this dish you'll also be served tomato sauce on the side. This Thai street food recipe is easy to make an outrageously tasty!\n\n\nHere are the ingredients you're going to need for this Thai street food omelet recipe:\n2 eggs\n2 tablespoons minced pork (or minced chicken)\n3/4 teaspoon soy sauce\nAbout \u00bd cup of oil for frying\nTomato sauce (optional)\nFresh steamed rice\n\nFull Thai omelet recipe here: http://wp.me/p4a4F7-2ke\nMore authentic Thai recipes: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-recipes/\n\nMusic in this video courtesy of Audio Network.\n\nFree Thai street food guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/free-bangkok-dollar-menu-guide/\nEating Thai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/\nBangkok 101 Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-things-to-do-in-bangkok/ \nThank you so much for watching this food and travel video by Mark Wiens.

Known for his bold artistic vision and fresh dynamic interpretations of classical Chinese music, Mr Chiang collaborated and struck notes with the NYPCO members to introduce western music, Chinese pop, evergreen songs and even Japanese and Korean pop pieces into the repertoire.\n\nIn October 2010, the Orchestra's performance clip of a specially-arranged K-pop Medley was put on YouTube and amassed more than 28,000 views worldwide within a short space of time, making it the fourth most favorite music clip on YouTube for that month! Numerous international websites, including Korean sites, as well as local media, such as The New Paper, featured the success of this viral hit. \n\nThanks to the nurturing support endowed by the NYP management, the NYPCO has grown from strength to strength, giving the young performers new opportunities and inspiration to hone their musical talents and enrich their learning journey. \n\nIn 2007, the Orchestra competed internationally for the first time. At the Australian International Music Festival, the Orchestra set a new record in the Festival's 18-year history for being the first performing group to secure perfect scores from the entire panel of international adjudicators. They were subsequently invited to perform at the Festival's Command Performance at the Sydney Opera House to a standing ovation. \n\nIn 2011, the Orchestra clinched another gold medal at the 2011 Asia Pacific Chinese Music Exchange and Competition in Taiwan, despite facing tough competition from Chinese Orchestras from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The competition was adjudicated by a panel of nine eminent composers, Chinese classical musicians and renowned academics from around the region. NYPCO received the highest marks allocated in the competition. \n\nStudents and alumni members of the NYPCO are also privileged to be able to walk the distance in dedicating their musical talents to worthy causes by performing in charity events for the less fortunate.

Here are the top 10At number one is the rare and striking giant ibis (Thaumatibis gigantea) -- the world's largest ibis weighing in 4.2kg and reaching more than one metre in height. With only 230 pairs estimated to remain in the wild, it is a critically endangered species. Habitat loss, human disturbance and possible hunting have reduced its range to an extremely small, declining population concentrated in Cambodia. Photograph: FLPA/AlamyA drawing of the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles savesi) by Joseph Smit for the Ibis Journal, 1881. This mysterious species, endemic to the island of New Caledonia, has not been seen since 1998. The bird has been classified as critically endangered as its population is unlikely to number more than 50 individuals.A California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) in flight over the Grand Canyon national park. In 1981 the wild population numbered just 21 birds after a century of persecution (shooting, poisoning,), unintentional poisoning (lead shot) and loss of wildlands. Enormous efforts have been made to save the species from extinction. Photograph: Charles Melton/AlamyAt number four on the list is the kakapo (Strigops habroptila), a noctural parrot that has evolved as flightless due to the historic absence of mammalian predators in its New Zealand habitat. Hunting, the introduction of predators, forest clearance and habitat degradation have caused a catastrophic decline in numbers. It is now extinct throughout its natural range, and survives only on three small, intensively managed islands following a series of successful translocations. Dedicated conservation efforts have seen the population increase slowly to 125 individuals. Photograph: Stephen Belcher/CorbisThe kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) is fifth on the list. This ash-white bird is mainly found in the dense, humid forests of New Caledonia and is known locally as the 'ghost of the forest'. Photograph: Doug Cheeseman/Getty ImagesThe Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) is one of the most threatened bustards in the world. There are two subspecies, one in India and Nepal, and the other thousands of kilometres away in Cambodia. Both populations are in decline and threatened by habitat loss for conversion to agriculture and illegal hunting. The total global population has been estimated at less than 1,000 adults. Photograph: FLPA/AlamyAt number seven is the Forest owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), which has been reduced by habitat loss to an extremely small and fragmented population in central India. Photograph: PM Laad/ZSLThe Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is one of the world's largest, most powerful birds of prey. Endemic to the Philippines, the eagle's small, rapidly declining population has been feared close to extinction for the past 40 years. In light of this, it recently acquired the status of the national bird of the Philippines, which has helped greatly to increase awareness of the bird and its plight.

When the metal turns liquid, he pours the molten metal into a steel ingot mold, creating an elongated rod of silver.  He then releases the silver ingot from the mold, quenches it in water, dries it with a cloth, and quickly files off the sharp fins formed from the pour with a hand file.\n\nThe smooth ingot now undergoes reforming in the rolling mill, reshaping the metal into a long square rod, all while reducing its outer dimensions.  After repeated rolling, tightening the mill with each successive pass through the rollers, the ingot becomes narrower and longer, hardened by the repeated rolling.\n\nJay returns to the workbench with the square stock, anneals it with the torch again to a dull red color.  This softens the metal for further shaping by the rolling mill.  It is then quenched in water and dried again.\n\nThe ingot is now ready to be flattened to its final thickness (about 22 gauge) with the rolling mill.  By guiding the ingot through the flat rollers, tightening them with each pass through the mill, a perfectly straight, smooth-edge bezel is created.\n\nThe clock shows 5:02 pm after the last pass through the mill.

I really, really hope I don't let you down with this!!  \nOne last thing I gotta say - this is dedicated to the boys who started singing this song in the middle of humanities class with no purpose save to celebrate the joy of living, and to the teacher good-natured enough to do nothing but turn from the blackboard to give them a bemused look, wait for the singing to fade into giggles, and carry on with his lesson.  It's moments like that that remind you that life isn't half as sucky as people say it is.  \nSTORYLINE;  Quite simple, really.  Hook steals Lilo to lure Pan into saving the 'poor girl'.  But Lilo kind of likes this slightly effeminate pirate, and has waited for an adventure like this for all her life.  Hook, in turn, finds that Lilo is actually a better conversationist than most of his crew - and she dances, too!  So they become friends and flirts (platonically, kiddies, don't worry).

I'm Bob Gosselin from Gosselin Realty.  This is your weekly West Orange county real estate report for the week ending September 29.  Onboard Informatics and Coldwell Banker Real Estate looked at 11-thousand suburbs across the country.  Taking in factors like home ownership, number of college graduates, income, money spent eating in vs. eating out....the top suburb in Florida is.....Windermere.  Nearby Dr. Phillips ranked number 21.  Amazingly, Windermere wasn't even in the top 100 suburbs overall.  I guess they didn't take sunshine into consideration.\n\nTaking a look at what sold last week in West Orange County.  We pull these numbers from the Mid-Florida Regional M-L-S and include the communities of Windermere, Ocoee, Winter Garden, Oakland and Gotha.  As usual, lots of closings at the end of the month.  43 single family homes sold.  Top price paid was $712-thousand for a 4-bed/3-bath home in Keene's Pointe.  More than half the homes sold for $250-thousand or less.  36 new listings hit the market.  Half are listed at $250-thousand or less.  Five are listed under $100-thousand.  45 new contracts were signed.\n\nThis is a question Realtors\u00ae get all the time from sellers.  \"Will my credit score suffer less if I short sale my home vs. letting it go into foreclosure?  \"With a short sale the seller is working with their lender to sell the house.  In a foreclosure, the seller is gone and the bank owns the house.  FICO looked at data over a two year period from 2009-2011.  The conclusion, while short sales represent a better risk, they do not perform well enough to merit more positive treatment in the FICO score.  The study found that 50-percent of borrowers who did a short sale go on to default on another account within two years.  From a weighting perspective all these mortgage events correlate with exceptional riskiness.  From a pure emotional standpoint, we have found over the last couple of years that our customers who can complete a short sale are in a much better place up here than those who lose their house to foreclosure.  Sometime it's not always about the numbers.\n\nSpeaking of short sales and foreclosures, if you have an eye on a piece of property and it needs some work, you should consider making the purchase with the Federally-backed 203-K mortgage.  This is a rarely used financing vehicle that has received a lot of attention lately.  Not only will you be able to borrow money to make the purchase, but you can get extra money to buy appliances, fix a roof or even add a room.  As long as it adds value to the home.  Buyers have to put at least 3.5-percent down and all your estimates from contractors must be submitted before loan approval.  If this sounds like a good deal to you, give us a call and we'll tell you more about it.\nThat's your weekly West Orange county real estate report.  I'm Bob Gosselin from Gosselin Realty.

Dugong is the only marine mammal to feed on zoster's (marine plants) living on sandy shallow bottoms. Sirenian are sometimes called \"sea cows\".\nTo breathe, the dugong has to surface. Its apneas owed long minutes. When it inhales, it emits a relatively noisy kind of \"phaaa\" sound. To communicate, Sirenian emits small shouts.

He pleaded no contest to trespassing and remains on probation.\n\nIn 2012, Will Smith slapped Sediuk after he tried to kiss him on a red carpet, and he drew Madonna's ire a year earlier by presenting her a bouquet of flowers.\n\nIn the latest incident, Sediuk is accused of jumping over a barrier in a fan area and rushing at Pitt along the red carpet, touching him briefly before security guards wrestled Sediuk away in handcuffs.\n\nPolice could only confirm that he made contact with Pitt and could not classify it further. Pitt was apparently unhurt and resumed signing autographs before walking into the theater.\n\nSediuk worked for Ukrainian television channel 1+1 before he was recently fired, station general director Oleksandr Tkachenko said. No further details were provided.\n\nJolie stars in \"Maleficent,\" Disney's new live-action spin on its animated classic \"Sleeping Beauty.\"\n\nAttorney Anthony Willoughby, who represented Sediuk in the Grammy trespassing case, said he will likely represent the former journalist if any new charges are filed.\n\nThe latest incident might constitute a violation of Sediuk's probation, the lawyer said.\n\n\"He's not a violent individual,\" Willoughby said. \"He's an easygoing young man.\"\n\nChrista Scherck, a publicist who worked with Sediuk for the past two years, said she was severing ties with him after his arrest. She said she was never aware of his prank plans.\n\n\"This goes beyond pranking,\" she said. \"This is no longer entertaining.\"\n\nBefore the incident, Jolie said the El Capitan is like a local theater for her, Pitt and their kids, who usually don't attend premieres but were present on Wednesday night.\n\nSediuk got to Pitt despite security that was heavy for a movie premiere, with guards keeping a large gap between the stars and the crowd.\n\nEmail messages left for representatives of Pitt and Disney were not immediately returned.", "title": "Brad Pitt Attacked, Punched At 'Maleficent' Premiere; Prankster Vitalii Sediuk Arrested", "publishedDate": "2014-05-29T20:14:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NAkfdBMTG0", "description": "Four people were burned when an explosion occurred at the Nestle Purina plant in Flagstaff Sunday afternoon.", "title": "Four burned in explosion at Flagstaff plant", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T06:08:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NAn52pJrVs", "description": "Here I show you how to change the headlamp bulb on a 2008 ford focus", "title": "Ford Focus 2008 how to change headlamp bulb in 2 minutes", "publishedDate": "2014-01-23T14:54:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NAsOjhacjw", "description": "http://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/lymplex.html\nhttp://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/store/lymplex.html\nhttp://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/Lymplex-ingredients.html\n\nLymph System Drainage, Digestive Cleansing, Detoxify Cleansing, Digestive Cleansing, Cleansing Detox, What Is The Lymph System, Cleansing The Lymph System, Lymph Cleansing\nDetoxify Cleanse, Lymphatic Cleansing , Detoxify Your System, How To Detoxify Your System, , Lymphatic System Cleansing, Cleanse Lymphatic System, Lymphatic System Herbs\nHerbs For The Lymphatic System, Swollen Lymph Nodes, Herbs For Lymphatic System, Herbs For Cleansing, Cleanse Lymph Nodes, Cleansing The Lymph System, 10 Cleanse, Lymphatic Massages\nHerbs For The Lymphatic System, Lymphatic Massages, Lymphatic Cleansing, System Cleansing, What Is Your Lymphatic System, Detox Cleansing, Lymph System Cleanse, Lymph Node Cleanse\nLymphatic Cleansing Diet, Herbs For The Lymphatic System, Lymphatic Cleansing Herbs, Cleanse The System, Detoxify Your System, Lymph Nodes Cleanse, Cleanse And Detoxify, Best Detoxifying Cleanse\n\nWhat Is Lymph System, Healthy Cleansing Detox, 10 Cleanse, Lymphatic Cleansing Exercise, Cleanse And Detoxify, Lymphatic Cleansing Diet, Lymphatic Cleanse, Cleansing The Lymph System\n \nhttp://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/store\nhttp://balancedhealthtoday.com/products.html", "title": "Lymph Health, Spleen Functions, Lymphatic System Cleanse, Detoxifying Cleanse", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T06:23:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NBkm9w76iA", "description": "Get Lost with Kelley Ferro aboard the beautiful MSC Divina!\nThe stunning MSC Divina pulled into Miami's harbor in November to start her Caribbean route.

In order to successfully take your game to the next level you have to stay focused on what you truly want, to direct your focus in the way of your dreams, and in the end take action into achieving what you want. \n\nVideo Transcription:\n\nHi, Dr. Brett here, psychologist, consultant, and coach.  How do I gain the confidence to take it up to the next level?  Well, when we think about taking it up to the next level, we're talking about intimacy, we're talking about relatedness, and we're talking about relationships, but we're also talking about business and success aren't we?  We're talking about a holistic approach to life.  Taking it up to the next level has to do with two things, primarily: your focus, your attention, and actually I'm going to add a third thing: your action.  So let's look at those three things.  We tend in general in life, to get what we focus on.  The better our focus, the better our results are.  The greater our intention, the more we get what we really want.  Our intention is basically focused thought, isn't it?  So therefore, if we have really good focus and we aim it in a certain direction, we're going to get more and more and more of that.  Now the next key is to take a lot of action.  The more action we take, the better -- especially if it's focused, because this way we can get feedback along the way, and then we can tweak our actions, and then we're going to get better and better.  The more we avoid, the worse it gets, so action is the key.  Again, we have focus, we have intention, and we have action.  Dr. Brett, psychologist, consultant, and coach.\n\n\nDr. Brett, Westport Psychologist, has over 30,000 hours experience in working with clients. \n\n\n\nLink to the next video in the series:\nhttp://youtu.be/8cvfGl9ihWA\n\nLink to my homepage:\nhttp://www.drbrettdenkin.com\n\nLink to my Westport Psychologist page:\nhttp://www.drbrettdenkin.com/ct/westport-psychologist/", "title": "Dr. Brett - Westport Psychologist - Three quick steps to taking your game to the next level", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T00:28:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NDF3-qyqFM", "description": "Hair-by-hair detailing on an artist resin model horse.

His History of the Peloponnesian War recounts the 5th century BC war between Sparta and Athens to the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \"scientific history\", because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis in terms of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work.[1]\nHe has also been called the father of the school of political realism, which views the relations between nations as based on might rather than right.[2] His text is still studied at advanced military colleges worldwide, and the Melian dialogue remains a seminal work of international relations theory.\nMore generally, Thucydides showed an interest in developing an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as plague, massacres, as in that of the Melians, and civil war.\n\nIn spite of his stature as a historian, modern historians know relatively little about Thucydides' life. The most reliable information comes from his own History of the Peloponnesian War, which expounds his nationality, paternity and native locality. Thucydides informs us that he fought in the war, contracted the plague and was exiled by the democracy. He may have also been involved in quelling the Samian Revolt.[3]\n[edit]Evidence from the Classical Period\nThucydides identifies himself as an Athenian, telling us that his father's name was Olorus and that he was from the Athenian deme of Halimous.[4] He survived the Plague of Athens[5] that killed Pericles and many other Athenians. He also records that he owned gold mines at Scapte Hyle (literally: \"Dug Woodland\"), a coastal area in Thrace, opposite the island of Thasos.[6]\n\nBecause of his influence in the Thracian region, Thucydides wrote, he was sent as a strategos (general) to Thasos in 424 BC. During the winter of 424-423 BC, the Spartan general Brasidas attacked Amphipolis, a half-day's sail west from Thasos on the Thracian coast, instigating the Battle of Amphipolis. Eucles, the Athenian commander at Amphipolis, sent to Thucydides for help.[7] Brasidas, aware of Thucydides's presence on Thasos and his influence with the people of Amphipolis, and afraid of help arriving by sea, acted quickly to offer moderate terms to the Amphipolitans for their surrender, which they accepted. Thus, when Thucydides arrived, Amphipolis was already under Spartan control.[8]\nAmphipolis was of considerable strategic importance, and news of its fall caused great consternation in Athens.[9] It was blamed on Thucydides, although he claimed that it was not his fault and that he had simply been unable to reach it in time. Because of his failure to save Amphipolis, he was sent into exile:[10]\n\" It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.", "title": "Quote of the day : Thucydides : \"Happiness depends...", "publishedDate": "2011-05-02T17:30:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NNNTSRLUn4", "description": "Subscribe for new videos every Monday and Thursday:  http://goo.gl/K1e8Q\n\nKatie Lemon takes a huge buck with a muzzleloader in central Utah. \n\nhttp://www.mossback.com", "title": "Utah Muzzleloader Mule Deer Hunt - Katie Lemon - MossBack", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T15:49:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NNS0JG5DnI", "description": "Raw, Shot with my cell phone... lol.
