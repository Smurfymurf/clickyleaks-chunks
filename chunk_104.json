The F-35 has three main models: the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant, the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) variant, and the F-35C carrier-based CATOBAR (CV) variant.\n\nThe F-35 is descended from the X-35, which was the winning design of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. It is being designed and built by an aerospace industry team led by Lockheed Martin. Other major F-35 industry partners include Northrop Grumman, Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems. The F-35 took its first flight on 15 December 2006. The United States plans to buy 2,443 aircraft. The F-35 variants are intended to provide the bulk of its manned tactical airpower for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy over the coming decades. Deliveries of the F-35 for the U.S. military are scheduled to be completed in 2037.[9]\n\nF-35 JSF development is being principally funded by the United States with additional funding from partners. The partner nations are either NATO members or close U.S. allies. The United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Turkey are part of the active development program;[10][11] Several additional countries have ordered, or are considering ordering, the F-35.\n\nDesign\nOverview\nThe F-35 appears to be a smaller, single-engine sibling of the twin-engine Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, and indeed drew elements from it. The exhaust duct design was inspired by the General Dynamics Model 200 design, proposed for a 1972 supersonic VTOL fighter requirement for the Sea Control Ship.[199] Lockheed consulted with the Yakovlev Design Bureau in the F-35B STOVL variant's development, purchasing design data from their development of the Yakovlev Yak-141 \"Freestyle\".[200] Although several experimental designs have been developed since the 1960s, such as the unsuccessful Rockwell XFV-12, the F-35B is to be the first operational supersonic, STOVL stealth fighter.[201]\n\nAcquisition deputy to the assistant secretary of the Air Force, Lt. Gen. Mark D. \"Shack\" Shackelford has said that the F-35 is designed to be America's \"premier surface-to-air missile killer and is uniquely equipped for this mission with cutting edge processing power, synthetic aperture radar integration techniques, and advanced target recognition.\"[202][203] Lockheed Martin states the F-35 is intended to have close- and long-range air-to-air capability second only to that of the F-22 Raptor.[204] Lockheed Martin has said that the F-35 has the advantage over the F-22 in basing flexibility and \"advanced sensors and information fusion\".[205] Lockheed Martin has suggested that the F-35 could replace the USAF's F-15C/D fighters in the air superiority role and the F-15E Strike Eagle in the ground attack role, although the F-35 lacks the range of the F-15.[206]\n\nSome improvements over current-generation fighter aircraft are:\n\nDurable, low-maintenance stealth technology, using structural fiber mat instead of the high-maintenance coatings of legacy stealth platforms;[207]\nIntegrated avionics and sensor fusion that combine information from off- and on-board sensors to increase the pilot's situational awareness and improve target identification and weapon delivery, and to relay information quickly to other command and control (C2) nodes;\nHigh speed data networking including IEEE 1394b[208] and Fibre Channel.[209] (Fibre Channel is also used on Boeing's Super Hornet.[210])\nThe Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS), Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) and Computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) are to help ensure aircraft uptime with minimal maintenance manpower.[211] The Pentagon has moved to open up the competitive bidding by other companies.[212] This was after Lockheed Martin stated that instead of costing twenty percent less than the F-16 per flight hour, the F-35 would actually cost twelve percent more.[213] Though the ALGS is intended to reduce maintenance costs, the company disagrees with including the cost of this system in the aircraft ownership calculations.[214] The USMC have implemented a workaround for a cyber vulnerability in the system.[215]\nElectro-hydrostatic actuators run by a power-by-wire flight-control system.[216]\nA modern and updated flight simulator, which may be used for a greater fraction of pilot training in order to reduce the costly flight hours of the actual aircraft.[217]\nLightweight, powerful and volatile Lithium-ion batteries similar to those that have grounded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet.[218]", "title": "US navy begins tests of ADVANCED F-35 on aircraft carrier", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T05:06:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Y5XtSnRsyc", "description": "", "title": "King of the Filler", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T21:15:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Y5wvhQnck4", "description": "Order Now - http://www.matbock.com/products/tarsier-eclipse\nMATBOCK's Tarsier Eclipse - Taken by I^2Technologies and Systems Integrations - http://www.isquarednightvision.com/", "title": "MATBOCK Tarsier Eclipse taken by I^2Technologies and Systems Integrations", "publishedDate": "2013-09-04T18:54:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Y64Fo29wz4", "description": "Maklumat lanjut:-\nhttp://tinyurl.com/9m7dla7", "title": "Rahsia Fibonacci dalam Forex trading", "publishedDate": "2013-12-15T00:15:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Y6hVQn-e5Y", "description": "\"On the Border\" by Al Stewart in a live performance.", "title": "Al Stewart - On the Border (live)", "publishedDate": "2006-10-24T09:50:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Y6iPwq7_VQ", "description": "Use a wood turning bowl gouge to cut out the inside of a bowl.

Swizzy's sonic architecture effortlessly ascends to a realm of the rarest of air, where the club template has been obliterated and replaced with true audio anarchy. Steroid injected kicks, claps and buildups collide with hyperactive tempos and pulverizing drops to describe a post apocalyptic warzone where the dance floor is the only safe haven. \"Bass\" is a call to arms. Swizzy commands us to join him on a journey to find out just how deep and more importantly - how far - the bass goes. No one knows til we get there...not even Swizzymack. \"Bouncin\" is told from a twerker's point of view. Her booty is clearly too fat and she loves bouncin' it for Swizzy. It's the soundtrack to getting a walley on a space station. And the close out the EP is the tricky, trippy and slippery joint \"Drip\". It plucks, pops and glides in and out of all the right places with ease. By the time Swizzy's trademark sirens drop in it's too late - you're too wet - and the floor is dripping with twerk sweat.\n\nSign up for Mad Decent Premium today and download the WAVs exclusively at http://drip.fm/mad-decent", "title": "Swizzymack - Drip", "publishedDate": "2013-06-10T19:26:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YFzHkOCtB8", "description": "Happy Halloween everyone!\n\n\nEngineer's theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFzLvRqsVvo\nSpy's theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqIEuY6tYQM\nMedic's theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY8TgDnATGU\nHalloween theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiyU7bi8CTI\nSoldier's theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOa8HGMN0A\nMann Vs.

These might be redundant in the future, as the car maker is working on a laser sensor that will be integrated in the car itself (think the sensor tower on top of Google's self-driving car, but completely integrated in the chassis).\n\nThe self-parking system also needs access to the car park's management system, in order to find and allocate a free parking space and transmit the route to the car. Since most modern car parks have more than one level or are underground, GPS-based positioning is not really an option, so instead the management system uses Wi-Fi to transmit the route.\n\nThe technologies that Audi is developing for its future piloted driving system have been highly acclaimed by US experts. The \"Popular Science\" magazine has named the Audi system for piloted parking in parking garages \"Product Of The Future.\" The editorial team is thus recognizing the most significant developments presented by Audi at the Consumer Electronics Show 2013 (CES) in Las Vegas.\n\nThe new Audi system was also commended as \"Best Automotive Technology\" at this year's CES by specialized media network \"The Verge.\" Ricky Hudi, Head of Electrics/Electronics Development at Audi: \"The awards acknowledge our development work and show that we are on the right track.\"", "title": "Audi Self Driving Auto Parking", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T14:55:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YVpSdwEJAM", "description": "Partnership for a Drug-Free America\nLike this video?

Make sure your polish or acrylic paint is thin so the brush strokes can be thin. \n1) With a thin brush, make several lines in white.\u00a0\n2) Do the same with the next lightest color (mint), but leave some of the white showing.\u00a0\n3) Continue this pattern further up the nail with the rest of the colors.\u00a0\n4) Add a top coat and you're done!\n\nI named this nail design dip dye nails because the small brush strokes remind me of dip dyed hair.

A special forum was formed for Israelis and Palestinians who have lost someone dear in the conflict. Our correspondent visited one the forum meetings for our next story.\n\nA forum for bereaved families -- only Israelis and Palestinians who have lost someone dear in the conflict between the parties can participate in it.\n\nThey come together in order to talk and persuade school children and adults in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority to step away from the path of war and to choose peace, reconciliation and tolerance.\n\nThe only place where Israelis and Palestinians can meet without a certificate from the army is at the Everest Hotel in Beit Jala, near Jerusalem.\n\nThis time they came to hear the Conservative Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg, who came all the way from London to be with them.\n\n[Tsurit Sarig, Bereaved Mother]:\n\"I lost my oldest son 14 years ago at the Western Wall tunnel in Jerusalem.\"\n\n[Zurit Sarig, Bereaved Mother]:\n\"When we sat at home feeling that our world got ruined, with the terrible pain and a thought of how to keep on going from here, a heavy feeling of anger accompanied it. We had the feeling that if we let anger redirect our lives, we would not be able to live our lives at all. We joined the bereaved families forum, so that other families would not have to go through what we went through.\"\n\nA Palestinian resident of Hebron, who lost two brothers, tells us in fluent Hebrew why he established the Palestinian branch of the bereaved families forum.\n\nIt was after bereaved families from Israel came to visit him at his home in 2002.\n\n[Halad Abu Awad, Co-Executive Director, Bereaved Families Forum]:\n\"We realized that these people want peace between the two sides, Israelis and Palestinians. In each of their stories, I felt the pain was in their hearts.\"\n\nThe guest at the meeting is neither an Israeli, nor a Palestinian.\n\nHe is a Conservative rabbi who came to tell the story of his journey from Frankfurt on foot in order to study Jewish history on the banks of the Rhine River.\n\nHe tells the audience about his thoughts while he was walking.\n\n[Jonathan Wittenberg, Conservative Rabbi]:\n\"Try not just to be on the Israeli side and try not just to be on the Palestinian side, please be on the human side because that is what we all are.\n\n\"Does the meeting between the bereaved families help participants?\n\n[Halad Abu Awad, Co-Executive Director, Bereaved Families Forum]:\n\"Every day one needs to renew his faith in a harsh reality we live in. The meeting with the other always has an effect. It is to meet the witnesses from the other side, to get to know them. It is to hear them directly rather than through the pipeline or other media, but from a living human being. It's powerful, it's always the most powerful for me.\"\n\nThe key is society's ability to recognize diversity among its people.\n\n[Jonathan Wittenberg, Conservative Rabbi]:\n\"... is the ability of the society to include, the ability of the society to have people participate fully and equally, whose religion, whose family, whose story are different.\"\n\nIn conclusion, despite the pain of bereavement, there is a message of optimism.\n\n[Tsurit Sarig, Bereaved Mother]:\n\"If we, Palestinians and Israelis, each of us who have lost a loved one, can talk, -- then anyone can. Our leaders must do it.\"\n\nReporter:Aviva Grunpeter      Photographer:Michael Ash\n\nNTD News, Beit Jalla near Jerusalem, Palestinian Authority", "title": "Bereaved Israeli and Palestinian Families Support Reconciliation and Tolerance", "publishedDate": "2011-02-08T16:16:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Ygi11Wzhng", "description": "Interviste alle aspiranti Miss Italia del Piemonte, a cura di Giovanni Marmina, in onda nei tg delle emittenti Videonovara, Teleritmo, Telebiella, Teleregione, Valsesia Tv, Vcosat.

This video will give you a little insight in to this authority and how the BLM has used it since 2004. \n\nSome of the features of the authorizing legislation includes allowing BLM to apply the value of timber or other forest products removed as an offset against the cost of services received, apply excess receipts from a project to other authorized stewardship projects, select contracts and agreements on a \"best value\" basis, and award a contract or agreement up to ten years which may stimulate long term investment in the local community. Stewardship contracts may be used for treatments to improve, maintain, or restore forest or rangeland health; restore or maintain water quality; improve fish and wildlife habitat; and reduce hazardous fuels that pose risks to communities and ecosystem values.\nStewardship contracting includes natural resource management practices that seek to promote a closer working relationship with local communities in a broad range of activities that improve land conditions. These projects shift the focus of federal forest and rangeland management towards a desired future resource condition. They are also a means for federal agencies to contribute to the development of sustainable rural communities, restore and maintain healthy forest ecosystems, and provide a continuing source of local income and employment.\nInterest in the use of stewardship contracting continues to increase, and more contracts are awarded each year in Oregon/Washington BLM. Since receiving stewardship contracting authority in 2003, the Oregon/Washington BLM has awarded 88 stewardship contracts. These contracts were awarded as part of the 28 individual stewardship projects in Oregon/Washington BLM which cover 41,616 acres of BLM land.\n\nhttp://www.blm.gov/or/resources/forests/programs.php", "title": "BLM Stewardship Contracting", "publishedDate": "2012-01-30T21:33:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YlX6m2TClA", "description": "yeah the title speaks for its self", "title": "Never handcuff an admin on Dayz", "publishedDate": "2013-12-30T12:48:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Yliy1X_kmk", "description": "", "title": "anagallis", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T19:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YmFlNEwhTI", "description": "Un montage pour \u00e9tudier la charge et la d\u00e9charge d'un condensateur \u00e0 travers un conducteur ohmique.", "title": "Le dipole RC", "publishedDate": "2007-06-19T17:07:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YmfbwNF7Wc", "description": "Rejoins Dj Abdel sur Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/PageDjAbdel\n\nDj Abdel - A l'Ancienne Vol.1\nTrack #2\n\nViens \u00e9couter toutes les mixtapes et albums de Dj Abdel sur son site officiel http://www.djabdel.com (A l'ancienne volume 1, a l'ancienne volume 2, hiphop soul party, rnb international etc...)", "title": "Dj Abdel - Let the music Feat.

Its construction began in 1290, under direction of both of the Commune and the Pope. The main purpose was to build a large unique cathedral dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta in Cielo (Saint Mary), that could replace the two original churches in the square.\n\nThe Duomo is a magnificent building architecturally defined as a \"unique example of Gothic and Romanesque styles mixed.\"\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is one of its most impressive features, with 4 spiers that lay on 4 large bas-reliefs, each representing scenes from the Bible (Old Testament, New Testament, and Judgment Day).\n\nThe three enormous bronze doors, were created by the Sicilian sculptor Emilio Greco. In 1970 these doors replaced the original wooden ones, in order to avoi complete deterioration. Other important elements of the fa\u00e7ade are the Canopy, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and placed on top of the main entrance, and the bronze statues representing the 4 Evangelists: the Angel (Saint  Matthew), the Lion (Saint Mark), the Eagle (Saint John), the Bull (Saint Luke). The wonderful mosaics, are dedicated to Mary. They tell the story and life scenes of the Virgin, starting from the Assumption to the Nativity and Coronation. A central element of the Duomo fa\u00e7ade is the rose window, designed by Andrea di Cione, also called Orcagna. It is composed of two rows of columns with crossed arches, and in the middle is the face of Jesus Christ.\n\nArnolfo di Cambio and Lorenzo Maitani, important artists of their time, joined efforts for the general design of the Duomo, along with several other sculptors, goldsmiths and painter for its embellishment and finishing.\n\nAmong the sculptors was Ippolito Scalza, a local architect who had already designed several buildings in Orvieto, including the Town Hall Palace. Great painters such as Gentile da Fabriano, Beato Angelico, Ugolino di Prete Ilario and Luca Signorelli contributed to the interior frescos. Luca Signorelli painted the two amazing chapels \"Corporale\" and \"San Brizio.\"\n\nAnother building that is directly connected to the Duomo is the Tower of Maurizio, located in the Duomo square, right at the beginning of Via Duomo. On top of its short tower is an automated bronze statue that is still functioning who \"beats the hours\" by hitting a large bell with a hammer. The tower is equipped with a \"ariologium de muricio\", which means wall clock. It was meant to provide the duomo construction workers the work schedule, while they were building the Duomo. The popular name given to the tower (Maurizio) seems to come from an evolution of the word \"muricio.\"\n\nMany original documents and papers about the phases of the Duomo construction, are kept and displayed in the Opera del Duomo Museum.", "title": "The Duomo, Orvieto Umbria ENG - Orvietoviva.com", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T14:10:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Yt6FbUfrYI", "description": "", "title": "wits freshers 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T18:54:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YtD44okdoo", "description": "Lensman-X 3-Axis Gimbal with DJI S800 EVO & A2 Controller First Review\n\nhttp://www.alwarerc.com/shop/lensmanx-public-3axis-gimbal-for-dji-s800-p-141.html", "title": "Lensman-X 3-Axis Gimbal with DJI S800 EVO & A2 Controller First Review", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T03:26:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YtIkF9xOyo", "description": "Learn about advance and retreat footwork in fencing in this free online video lesson for beginners.", "title": "Basic Sword Fencing Moves & Techniques: Free Online Lessons for Beginners : Fencing Advance & Retreat Footwork: Free Fencing Lessons for Beginners", "publishedDate": "2007-09-11T15:36:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5YtJEMcYBFo", "description": "My semisarcastic happy birthday to Copernicus.

The yellowfin tuna is a species of tuna found in pelagic waters of tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide.\n\nYellowfin is often marketed as ahi, from its Hawaiian name ahi although the name ahi in Hawaiian also refers to the closely related bigeye tuna. Although the species name albacares might suggest otherwise, the fish usually known as albacore is a different species of tuna, Thunnus alalunga. The yellowfin tuna is sometimes referred to as albacora by French and Portuguese fishermen.\n\nThe yellowfin tuna is one of the largest tuna species, reaching weights of over 300 pounds (136 kg), but is significantly smaller than the Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas that can reach over 1,000 pounds (454 kg) and slightly smaller than the bigeye tuna and the southern bluefin tuna. Reported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as 239 centimeters (94.1 in) in length and 200 kilograms (441 lb) in weight.\n\nThe second dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of sickles or scimitars. The pectoral fins are also longer than the related bluefin tuna, but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines.", "title": "Extreme giant YellowFin tuna (Thunnus albacares) mount", "publishedDate": "2010-12-31T19:10:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z-fQqBFQs8", "description": "More info - http://www.image-line.com/documents/grossbeat.html\n\nGross Beat is a time manipulation effect designed for repetition and scratching effects. \n\nDownload the demo at the link above.\n\nThanks to Ed Chamberlain - http://soundcloud.com/ed-chamberlain for the Scratch Demo \n\nand\n\nnucleon - http://www.electroconductor.com/\n\nfor the Performance and Gating demo seen in this video\n\nEnjoy.", "title": "Image-Line | Gross Beat Introduction", "publishedDate": "2011-11-18T02:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z-fbDr59n0", "description": "http://www.prostatemagic.com\ncatheter\ncatheterization\npenis surgery\nsurgery penis", "title": "No Need For Male Penis Intermittent Self-Catheterization", "publishedDate": "2011-08-27T17:51:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z-ggza5G4A", "description": "funny seed dispersal", "title": "seed dispersal", "publishedDate": "2011-11-11T18:10:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z0-I_zgcVI", "description": "Jimmy Savile Assaulted Women At Prince Charles' Palace.", "title": "Jimmy Savile Assaulted Women At Prince Charles' Palace.", "publishedDate": "2012-10-30T19:49:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z0T5rrr7Qk", "description": "", "title": "Best Absorb Coenzyme Q10", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T02:18:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z0f9SHy6YM", "description": "", "title": "Marmot Pulsar 1 Tent", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T16:37:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z0rP144dUA", "description": "D1 (Untitled)", "title": "Lotharbot trains Nonagon", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T02:31:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Z0ytDZVmiI", "description": "Swamp Dogs flyball practice bloopers.

Standard & Poor's Ratings Services on Monday downgraded the credit ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. S&P Downgrades Fannie and Freddie, U.S.-Backed Debt. All the downgrades were from AAA to AA+, reflecting the same downgrade S&P made of long-term U.S. government debt on Friday.  Oil tumbles, gold tops $1,700. \"I believe this is, without question, the tea party downgrade,\" Sen. John F. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" yesterday. Former senior Obama advisor David Axelrod used the exact same phrase in blaming opponents of tax hikes for the debt downgrade. Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans worth more than $5 trillion. As part of a nationalized system, they account for nearly all new mortgage loans. Their downgrade might force anyone looking to buy a home to pay higher mortgage rates. However, the debt ceiling debate was nothing more than a complete distraction from the real cause of America's economic crisis. The downgrade of long-term debt issued by the U.S. government affects the banking and lending industries because many interest rates are pegged to the yields on Treasury securities. In addition, many companies use the securities as collateral that they would surrender if their bets lost value. S&P Managing Director John Chambers said that the credit rating agency believes the dollar won't be weakened \"under any plausible scenario.\" He said it will remain the dominant international currency, and that will reduce interest rates for governments and the private sector. Ten of the country's 12 Federal Home Loan Banks also were downgraded from AAA to AA+. The banks of Chicago and Seattle had already been downgraded earlier to AA+.\n\n\n\n\nBiggest point gainers: GOLD (102.84 +8.36), TVIX (41.41 +6.99), BSFT (29.10 +5.40), DTO (65.23 +3.77), DGP (60.25 +3.66), VXX (33.45 +3.14), AEM (59.21 +2.86), NEM (56.82 +2.41), GG (48.68 +2.34), VXZ (55.94 +2.34), ABX (48.20 +2.34), TRH (47.40 +2.16), MRX (34.05 +1.96), RES (21.41 +1.96), AU (43.28 +1.47), ANV (36.80 +1.44), BVN (40.79 +1.37), RGLD (67.77 +1.23), EGO (18.42 +1.10), UVV (37.13 +0.80), WLT (74.00 +0.70), AUY (13.83 +0.61), GFI (15.37 +0.57), PG (61.13 +0.54). \n\nBiggest point losers: ZOLL (44.51 -16.42), MA (311.44 -15.10), ISRG (344.39 -14.18), CEO (187.21 -12.15), CMG (300.00 -11.52), NFLX (229.96 -11.15), AAPL (363.03 -10.59), FOSL (99.99 -10.57), WYNN (130.51 -9.40), CRR (126.00 -8.86), OIH (127.31 -8.47), DECK (82.76 -8.36), CME (261.45 -7.97), BLK (153.69 -7.89), GS (117.58 -7.60), AZO (271.33 -7.41), BEN (110.33 -7.33), BIDU (133.80 -7.19), CRM (128.63 -7.06), ANF (63.44 -6.86), SM (71.99 -6.83), SI (102.83 -6.75), PII (95.48 -6.72).\n\n\nTags \"black monday\" \"stock market\" crash \"stock market meltodown\" \"S&P dowgrade\" \"stock market crash\" \"market crash\" \"stock market meltdown\" \"market meltdown\" \"black monday 8/8/2011\" \"stocks tank\" \"us economy\" \"us debt downgrade\" cnbc bloomberg obama trading economic gold silver \"gold prices\" \"silver prices\" \"day trading\" \"trading stocks\" \"options trading\" \"alex jones\" \"ben bernanke\" \"ron paul\" \"jim cramer\" \"peter schiff\" \"gerald celente\" \"dow jones\" \"S&P 500\" \"stock market 2011 crash\" \"crash 2011\" \"federal reserve\" \"united states economy\" \"economic meltdown\" Greece Spain Portugal Ireland bailout TAARP QE2 Q3 \"economic stimulus\" 401k", "title": "Dow Jones Nasdaq S&P 500 Crash 2011 Down 635 Points on Massive Selling Closing Bell", "publishedDate": "2011-08-08T20:05:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZD4a3qDNlk", "description": "Learn more about YouTube Video ads at http://www.YouTube.com/yt/advertise/ \nor call us at 1-855-500-2756", "title": "YouTube Video Ads - Watch it Work for Your Business", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T01:31:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZDrMx1t01g", "description": "Project Zero II Crimson Butterfly Tribute Movie.

See separate leaflet called Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men where these are discussed in more detail. LUTS can also be caused by other conditions.\n\nAs the prostate enlarges it may cause narrowing of the first part of the urethra. This may partially obstruct the flow of urine. This can lead to obstructive symptoms such as:\n\n    Poor stream. The flow of urine is weaker, and it takes longer to empty your bladder.\n    Hesitancy. You may have to wait at the toilet for a while before urine starts to flow.\n    Dribbling. Towards the end of passing urine, the flow becomes a slow dribble.\n    Poor emptying. You may have a feeling of not quite emptying your bladder.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a natural remedy for enlarged prostate that work?

They comprise a premium family of spices that are also used in Indian cooking.\n\nThe nutmeg tree is any of several species of trees in genus Myristica. The most important commercial species is Myristica fragrans, an evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (or Spice Islands) of Indonesia. The nutmeg tree is important for two spices derived from the fruit: nutmeg and mace.\n\nNutmeg is the seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to 1 in) long and 15 to 18 mm (0.6 to 0.7 in) wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g (0.2 and 0.4 oz) dried, while mace is the dried \"lacy\" reddish covering or aril of the seed. The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7--9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after 20 years. Nutmeg is usually used in powdered form. This is the only tropical fruit that is the source of two different spices. Several other commercial products are also produced from the trees, including essential oils, extracted oleoresins, and nutmeg butter (see below).\n\nThe common or fragrant nutmeg, Myristica fragrans, native to the Banda Islands of Indonesia, is also grown in Penang Island in Malaysia and the Caribbean, especially in Grenada. It also grows in Kerala, a state in southern India. Other species of nutmeg include Papuan nutmeg M. argentea from New Guinea, and Bombay nutmeg M. malabarica from India, called jaiphal in Hindi; both are used as adulterants of M. fragrans products.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Forget WorldStar -- this is how they throw down in the jungle!\n\nThe monkey is actually a type of lesser ape known as a Gibbon, commonly found in tropical jungles throughout Southeast Asia. The Gibbons are fiercely territorial, and extremely agile tree-swingers. This ape uses his speed to easily evade any attempt at counter-attack by the frustrated tigers.

But while these cats are young, the Gibbon has the rare chance to embarrass two of the most feared predators in the world.

Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda is ejected from the game in the 2nd\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Less than two weeks after pitching against Boston with what appeared to be pine tar on his pitching hand, the New York Yankees' Michael Pineda was ejected from a game against the Red Sox on Wednesday night after umpires found a foreign substance on his neck.\n\nBoston manager John Farrell didn't alert umpires about brown goo on the lower part of Pineda's right palm during a 4-1 win over Boston at Yankee Stadium on April 10. Photos of Pineda's pitching hand that night sparked a debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grips in cool weather.\n\nWith two outs and a 1-2 count on Grady Sizemore on Wednesday, Farrell left his dugout to talk with plate umpire Gerry Davis, who went to the mound. Davis touched the right side of the pitcher's neck with his index finger then ejected Pineda as other umpires and Yankee infielders stood nearby.\n\nOn a night with a game time temperature of 50 degrees, Farrell had said before batting practice: \"I would expect if it's used, it's more discreet than last time.\"\n\nPineda left with the Yankees trailing 2-0 after he allowed two runs and four hits in the first inning. He was replaced by David Phelps.\n\nRule 8.02(b) says a pitcher shall not \"have on his person, or in his possession, any foreign substance. For such infraction of this section the penalty shall be immediate ejection from the game. In addition, the pitcher shall be suspended automatically.\"\n\n\"We will talk to the umpires tomorrow and review their report before taking any action,\" Major League Baseball spokesman Michael Teevan said.\n\nIn recent suspensions of pitchers for pine tar, Tampa Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Los Angeles Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped his challenge with no reduction.\n\nIn Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean.\n\n\"In conditions like last night, it's not uncommon for pitchers to try and get a grip in some way,\" Farrell said later. \"We're more focused on what we need to do offensively to kind of get going rather than taking anything away from his abilities.\"\n\nJoe Torre, MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations, said in a statement April 11 that Pineda would not be suspended for the substance on his hand.\nMichael Pineda ejection.\n\"Michael Pineda Pine Tar\"\n\"Michael Pineda ejection\"\n\"Michael Pineda ejected\"\n\"Michael Pineda expulsado\"\n\"Michael Pineda\"\n\"Michael Pineda expulsion\"\n\"michael pineda 2014\"\n\"michael pineda yankees\"\n\"Michael Pineda Neck\"\nNew York Yankees Michael Pineda Michael Pineda Foreign Substance Michael Pineda Neck Baseball MLB Michael Pineda Ejected MLB Yankees Red Sox Yankees Michael Pineda AP", "title": "Michael Pineda Ejected  Yankees Michael Pineda Pine Tar Ejection vs Red Sox 4 23 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T14:30:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZYQ1EQU2SY", "description": "GRACIAS ALA COLABORACION DE SLIM YERI POR ESTE TEMA KEMAO PARA LA MOVIDA .

The driver has been fired. \n\nTwin sisters, Annabelle and Emily Moon, of Charles County, Md., are fans of the \"American Girl\" dolls, which have different sets of clothing available for them. The girls' mom, Jackie Moon, ordered a new set of clothing for one of the dolls, and it arrived Thursday via FedEx.\n\nThe Moons have a camera-based home security system, which not only records video, but also emails the homeowner a snapshot when the motion sensors are triggered. The snapshot the Moon family received from the Thursday afternoon delivery certainly got their attention.\n\n\"This is the picture of the FedEx man standing at the end of the sidewalk, tossing the package,\" explained Jackie Moon. \"And you can see underneath, that the package is in mid-air, and that there's a shadow in the sidewalk from the package.\"\n\nThe Moons then looked at the video, which also recorded the sound of the package landing on their concrete porch after a 20-foot toss.\n\nNothing was broken, but Jackie Moon was horrified that any home-delivered package would be handled in such a manner.\n\n\"There was nothing breakable in the package,\" she said. \"That wasn't my point. He had no idea what was in the package ... it could have been something breakable. It was just the way that it was delivered to us, the carelessness that he took in delivering the package to our family.\"\n\nThe Moons shared the still picture of the package in mid-air (and the video of the toss) with friends and family.

Slime mold aggregation is a natural process that can be approximated with partial differential equations http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycetozoa\n\nScience Fiction\nWaiting\n\nPsalm 18:32 \"It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.\" \nA robot that can move about on its own must be programmed in great detail. Instructions must be given to each moving part. These instructions must also be able to direct the robot under all anticipated conditions. If there is any error in the instructions or an encounter with unexpected conditions, the robot will probably just freeze in place. Even slime mold can do better than this.\n\nEven though slime mold cells are not connected to each other by nerves, when the cells join together, the resulting organism is able to move. It is able to deal with unexpected circumstances moving about by shifting liquid to change their collective bag-shaped body. Taking their cue from slime mold, a research group from Tohoku University in Japan has used the same principle to make a mobile robot. The robot is able to move across any flat surface by shifting liquid around, which changes pressure on different parts of the robot. It is made of 14 interconnected syringes, each with a motor to move the water. It moves around randomly until it is given a direction. Then the motors synchronize, and the robot begins to move in the commanded direction. This slime-mold type arrangement adjusts to changes in environment just like the real thing.\n\nLeave it to God to accomplish a complicated task with a simple design.\n\nPrayer: \nFather, move my heart to flee what will spiritually harm me and to seek that good You have to give me. Amen.

The result delivers the stiffness, weight savings and durability that riders have come to expect the Ardennes line, but now offers an even larger tire contact patch, ensuring a ride that's actually faster and more comfortable too.\n\nThe key to the Ardennes' success has always been the innovative scandium C2 rim. At 24mm deep this hoop is amazingly light yet more aerodynamic than a traditional box-section rim. This weight saving, semi-aero profile isn't unique in and of itself, but it's just the beginning -- HED's engineers have realized that width also plays a critical role in cheating the wind. As such the new C2 Plus rim bed measures a full 25mm wide to help eliminate bulge and reduce drag when paired with 23mm or 25mm road tire. The wider rim also helps improve the wheel's stiffness and control, while a subsequently larger tire footprint affords riders lower rolling resistance and improved grip, all with minimal sacrifice on the scale.\n\nTo sweeten the deal even more, HED has outfitted this with their exclusive Sonic FR hubset. The front hub features a carbon shell, alloy flanges, 12mm oversized axle and top quality cartridge bearings. The rear hub features a full alloy shell, a 15mm oversized axle and cartridge bearings to match. Both hubs benefit from extra-wide flange spacing to reduce spoke flex and improve overall rigidity.\n\nTo tie it all together, the FR is assembled using ultra-light Sapim CX Ray bladed spokes. 18 are laced radially up front, and 24 laced 2x on the rear to further laterally stiffness, weight reduction and aerodynamics.\n\nThe Ardennes Plus FR Clincher Wheelset has a claimed weight of 1502 grams (650 gram front, 852 gram rear). Tubeless ready. Black rims with Silver spokes. 700c. The Shimano version is compatible with 11-speed cassettes and includes a spacer for Shimano/SRAM 8/9/10-speed cassettes. A Campagnolo 9/10/11 compatible version is also available.", "title": "Western Bikeworks Features: HED Ardennes Plus FR Wheelset", "publishedDate": "2014-01-03T18:57:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZlE0C3BvbA", "description": "http://www.TravelsWithSheila.com\nPassengers booked on Quark Expeditions \"Spitsbergen Explorer\" Sea Spirit Cruise were met at the Longyearbyen Airport by their representative and transferred to their hotels if they arrived one day early, which we certainly did.

It's just like got this very interesting taste, very different from, for instance, soy sauce which a lot of people use for dumplings.\n\nSo you're going to pour that in here.  \n\nNext, this little bit of sesame oil.  This adds like this nice nuttiness.  It's a little oily so it's got that nice mouth feel.  \n\nAnd then Locama Chili Oils.  So it's also known as Old Grandma Sauce on the street.  They have a lot of different varieties but this one has chili flakes and peanuts in it.  They also have a very popular black bean version.  \n\nSo I'm just going to pour that in here. So it's pretty spicy so if you really don't like spicy food, perhaps adjust out a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm just going to mix that all together and you're ready to eat some dumplings.  \n\nAnd that is how you make Dumpling Dipping Sauce.", "title": "How to Make Dumpling Dipping Sauce | Asian Cooking", "publishedDate": "2013-12-21T13:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Zt5swNWDqA", "description": "This short video demonstrates The Welders Warehouse Multi-Jet Oxygen/Fuel Nozzles being used with Oxygen & Propane Gas.

And if your body doesn't have the ability to break down that lactose then it sits in the gut and causes gas, cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. So you mentioned that you have a little daughter who has been having extra gas, you're concerned since she started drinking whole milk that this might be an issue for her. One of the things you can do is just try cutting dairy products out of her diet entirely for two weeks, and see if the symptoms improve. And then slowly start introducing milk products back into her diet to see if the symptoms return. If you suspect at that time that she's still lactose intolerant, then talk to the doctor and they can give you more specific advice about what foods she should be avoiding. \n\nBut here are some general guidelines. younger children usually can't tolerate products with lactose in them, but as they get older they may be able to tolerate a little bit more. But since your child is still young, try cutting all of these things out of her diet: milk, ice cream, soft cheeses like cottage cheese, American cheese and mozzarella, and as she gets older she may be able to tolerate things like yogurt, aged cheeses such as Swiss, cheddar and Parmesan. And again, your doctor can give you more specifics if you feel like this is an issue.\n\nBut it doesn't have to control your life or your daughter's if she is lactose intolerant. With a few small, simple diet changes, and with time, figuring out what her body can tolerate and what it can't, you'll be able to figure out the things she can eat and what she can't eat.\n\nIf you have any other questions for me, feel free to ask them on our Facebook page, facebook.com/intermountainmoms, and recommend us to your friends and family too.", "title": "What gives the same nutrients as whole milk?", "publishedDate": "2013-04-23T20:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZxZCgqNOnI", "description": "my peach tree prepares to delight us", "title": "Peach blossoms", "publishedDate": "2012-02-23T14:10:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZyJwWzzPwg", "description": "\u7528Vpython\u7684face\u6307\u4ee4\u5efa\u7acbquadric_surface\uff0c\u4e26\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6548\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u52d5\u756b\u3002", "title": "Quadric  Surface", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T07:16:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZyMwm-QTT4", "description": "Les Ships chantent pour Erina, dans l'\u00e9pisode 39 saison 3.", "title": "Les Ships (Gu\u00e9ris-Moi) Sp\u00e9cial", "publishedDate": "2011-04-09T22:46:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ZyOJ6uUWTE", "description": "Willy Wonka Slot Machine Bonus - Oompa Loompa Bonus Round x2!

It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "innovator mihir kumar panda and his work-news & views6", "publishedDate": "2011-05-06T09:23:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_3r_a-wPe0", "description": "Rakaposhi, Aliabad, Gilgit District, Pakistan.

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year. It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites, Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years.

Im Zuge der Gebirgsbildung vor etwa 70 Millionen Jahren wurde der urspr\u00fcnglich flach lagernde Unterkreide-Sandstein im Bereich der Gebirgskette an den Externsteinen senkrecht aufgepresst. Die markante Felsengruppe ist Bestandteil des gleichnamigen Naturschutzgebietes.\n \nAls markanter Gel\u00e4ndepunkt m\u00f6gen die Externsteine bereits w\u00e4hrend der Steinzeit f\u00fcr unsere Vorfahren Bedeutung besessen haben, sei es aus kultischen Gr\u00fcnden, um Schutz zu finden oder als Auslug nach Wild. Wie Feuerstein-Ger\u00e4te, Stielspitzen, Klingen und Steinschlagpl\u00e4tze aus der sp\u00e4ten Altsteinzeit beweisen, haben sich Menschen am Fluss der Felsen bereits um etwa 10.000 v. Chr. aufgehalten. Auch von den J\u00e4gern und Sammlern der Mittelsteinzeit um 8-4.000 v. Chr. gibt es Belegfunde. Hingegen fehlen gesicherte Funde des Menschen der Jungsteinzeit, Bronze- und Eisenzeit. Dieses Res\u00fcmee ergaben die umfangreichen und tiefreichenden Grabungen von Julius Andree im \u00f6stlichen Vorgel\u00e4nde von Felsen I bis III in den Jahren 1934/35. Zu dieser Zeit wurde auch der in der Romantik im Jahre 1836 angelegte Stauteich der Wiembecke abgelassen, aus Gr\u00fcnden der Landschafts\u00e4sthetik nach dem 2. Weltkrieg aber wieder hergestellt.\n \nDie arch\u00e4ologischen Grabungen erbrachten mittelalterliche Keramikfunde aus dem 10. bis 14. Jahrhundert und fr\u00fchneuzeitliches Material. Die monumentale Felsengruppe der Externsteine ist seit Jahrhunderten Gegenstand widerspr\u00fcchlicher Deutungen. Sie verbindet bizarre Naturformen mit Zeugnissen menschlicher Kultur: In den Fels geschlagene Treppen und R\u00e4ume, sich \u00fcberschneidende Bearbeitungsspuren am Sargfelsen, das Gro\u00dfrelief der Kreuzabnahme und andere Skulpturen, Inschriften und Zeichen bis zu Geb\u00e4uderesten aus dem Mittelalter. Den ersten Deutungsversuch unternahm 1564 der Lemgoer Pfarrer und Historiker Hermann Hamelmann. Er hielt die Externsteine f\u00fcr ein heidnisches Heiligtum, das Karl der Gro\u00dfe in ein christliches umgewandelt habe. Seit dem 18. Jahrhundert wurde auch die Ansicht vertreten, dass hier der Standort der von Karl dem Gro\u00dfen 772 zerst\u00f6rten Irminsul gewesen sei, eines s\u00e4chsischen Heiligtums.                          \n \n1823 wurde die obere Kapelle, auch H\u00f6henkammer oder Sazellum genannt, erstmalig als St\u00e4tte zur Beobachtung der Gestirne bezeichnet. Auf \u00e4ltere Vorstellungen zur\u00fcckgreifend entwickelte Wilhelm Teudt um 1925 seine Theorie \u00fcber germanische Heiligt\u00fcmer. Neben astronomischen Besonderheiten sollten sich die Externsteine durch eine ungew\u00f6hnlich intensive Erdstrahlung auszeichnen. Obwohl diese Ansichten vom \u00fcberwiegenden Teil der Fachwelt abgelehnt wurden, konnte Teudt viele Anh\u00e4nger f\u00fcr sich gewinnen. Nach 1933 wurde seine Theorie vor\u00fcbergehend von der Kulturpropaganda des Dritten Reiches aufgegriffen; arch\u00e4ologische Grabungen in den Jahren 1934/35 konnten die St\u00e4tte aber nicht eindeutig datieren. Neuere Forschungen durch Johannes Mundhenk belegen, dass die untere Kapelle der Externsteine im Jahre 1115 durch den Paderborner Bischof Heinrich II. geweiht worden ist. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten wurde an diesem Ort eine Heilig-Grab-Gedenkst\u00e4tte errichtet.\n \nDas Kreuzabnahme-Relief als Kernst\u00fcck der Anlage ist um 1150 entstanden und steht damit am Anfang der christlichen Monumentalplastik. Es ist das bedeutendste Zeugnis seiner Art in ganz Nordwest-Europa. Seine Vorbilder sind in den Miniaturen byzantinischer Elfenbeinschnitzerei und der fr\u00fchen Buchmalerei zu suchen. In der Gestaltung der Hauptfiguren, die in zeitgen\u00f6ssischer s\u00e4chsisch-fr\u00e4nkischer Tracht dargestellt sind, und in der Gesamtkomposition zeigt sich ein \u00fcberragender Meister, der die starren Formen der Vorbilder \u00fcberwunden und sein Kunstwerk den Verh\u00e4ltnissen in der freien Natur angepasst hat.", "title": "Die Externsteine im Teutoburger Wald", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T19:43:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_GZhAST33w", "description": "#PATTERNHOUSE WAITING FOR THE LIFT WITH AN ELEVATED SHUFFLE @CJ_Shapez @A_S_Thomas & @Kassidy_Chapz", "title": "ELEVATED SHAPES #PATTERNHOUSE", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T00:53:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_GoqcoBzRU", "description": "Kathleen shows you around the office in this week's RT Recap.

Learn more about Eczema scars at http://www.top10homeremedies.com/home-remedies/home-remedies-for-eczema-scars.html\n\n== Home Remedies for Eczema Scars ==\n\nOne of the skin ailments which can affect the morale of a person is eczema. It is a chronic skin disorder that entails\n\n\u2022 Itching\n\u2022 Skin irritation\n\u2022 Redness\n\u2022 Inflammation\n\u2022 Dryness\n\u2022 Thick, scaly patches (due to scratching)\n\u2022 Fluid-filled blisters that often leave behind ugly scars\n\nThe most common form of this condition is called Atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe exact cause of eczema is not known... yet the factors that increase the chances of flare-ups include:\n\n\u2022 Skin irritants (rough fabrics, heat, sweat, fragrances, dust, soil, chemicals present in cosmetics, soaps and household cleaners, hard water, certain metals like nickel or cobalt used in belt buckles and jewelry, etc.)\n\u2022 Allergens\n\u2022 Climate conditions\n\u2022 Hormonal changes\n\u2022 Upper respiratory infections\n\u2022 Stress\n\u2022 A family history of eczema\n\n\nEczema is not a contagious condition so it does not spread from one person to another. The downside is, it cannot be cured completely. Nevertheless, some home remedies can help you to manage the symptoms and heal eczema scars\n\n\nHome Remedy 1\n\u2022 Applying honey on the affected area is extremely useful. If it feels sticky, add a little water and then apply.\n\u2022 You can also scrub the affected area with a mixture of equal parts of lemon juice and crystallized sugar. \n\n\nHome Remedy 2\n\u2022 Take a glass of water.\n\u2022 Mix 2 teaspoons each of apple cider vinegar and honey.\n\u2022 Drink this.\n\u2022 You can also apply apple cider vinegar diluted in water.\n\n\nHome Remedy 3\n\u2022 Take 1 tablespoon each of crushed neem leaves and turmeric.\n\u2022 Add a little sesame oil.\n\u2022 Mix and grind the ingredients.\n\u2022 Apply this mixture on the affected area.\n\n\nTips\n\u2022 Apply coconut oil or aloe vera gel on the itchy rashes. They act as moisturizers and help fade the scars.\n\u2022 Do not use harsh soaps and detergents.\n\u2022 Do not scratch the affected area. To avoid itching, apply a wet cold compress.\n\u2022 Plus, try to identify the triggers that cause inflammation and avoid them.\n\n\n=====Follow us:=====\n\nWebsite - http://www.top10homeremedies.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/top10homeremedies\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/10homeremedies", "title": "Home Remedies for Eczema Scars", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T14:15:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_IYavV6DBw", "description": "hi, \u7149Party\u7684\u90a3\u5e7e\u5929\u5404\u7a2e\u6709\u8da3\u963f\n\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u521d\u6b21\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u8ddf\u5927\u5bb6say hi\n\u4e5f\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u667a\u969c\u4e8b\n\u4e00\u8d77\u4f86\u770b\u770b\u5504OuO\n\n\u559c\u6b61\u6211\u7684\u983b\u9053\u7684\u8a71\n\u5c31\u8a02\u95b1\u6211\u5427\uff01\n\nFB\u7c89\u7d72\u5718 : https://www.facebook.com/oeurxhichocolate\nMy Twitter :https://twitter.com/OeurHiChocolate\nMy Twitch :http://www.twitch.tv/hichocolate", "title": "\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u7684\u7149Party\u6642\u9593#2\u300e\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u8822\u6a23\u300f", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T15:06:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_ImpMP2g4c", "description": "Video taken from the Atlanta Aquarium tunnel of a ray, a hammerhead shark, a sawfish and one of the two whale sharks.\n\nCarlos Granier-Phelps\nDirector: Carlos Granier-Phelps", "title": "Ray, Hammerhead, Sawfish and Whale Shark at the Atlanta Aquarium", "publishedDate": "2011-04-25T17:20:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_Iow975quY", "description": "Dr. Phyllis Filker discusses NSU's College of Dental Medicine", "title": "Nova Southeastern University's College of Dental Medicine", "publishedDate": "2009-05-05T13:16:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_J07RyVRX0", "description": "On busy bypass Road in Goa", "title": "Roadside sale - watermelons, Coconuts, Toddy palm, Palmyra Palm Fruit  etc", "publishedDate": "2011-04-20T19:25:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_JOLCCtWe8", "description": "The Pain Barrier at Parkwood 4x4, 2nd November 2013.

Well if it's in a waterfall it moves, it bounces off rocks. It's almost like a living thing. It has continuity, it has dash,  and then water sometimes can be so level that it almost becomes a perfect mirror. You've seen that and then out in the ocean it's waving and you want to have that feeling like what it's like to be in a boat. You feel that with that empathy and also when you paint water you want it to look wet. When you're working in watercolor wetness is a good idea there because that's very expressive and that's a media consideration. That's important. Now, I want to look at some examples of my work here and point out some of the matters related to empathy and expressiveness. \nIn this first painting, it's a winter scene, so I have made the sky wet and airy with soft edges. In this particular painting I have also used wet down here simulating snow, and I've used very neutral colors almost monochrome, just blues and a little bit of warms in the darks. This is a point of empathy. See how I've leaned the tree towards the barn and I've leaned the barn towards the tree, that's empathy, that's parts of the painting yearning for each other. That's very important in painting, that parts of the painting have an attraction for each other, and design and empathy helps us to do that. \nOn my next example here,  I have kind of a chalk drawing from a Viennese painter from 100 years ago, Egon Schiele. I would include him as an expressionist painting, if we're going to talk for a moment about expression as one of the art isms in history. He always struck me as someone who always gave his paintings a certain degree of weirdness and otherness. Suzanne Langer called it otherness. She said the chief thing we notice about any work of art is its otherness. It's apart from ordinary reality. I think that's true of even the most representational or realistic painting or abstract painting.

Believe it or not 40%! That's almost half of all hospitalizations which could potentially be avoided! Let's look at just a couple of common pitfalls.\n\nGeneric Versus Name Brand: Lynda has a history of high blood pressure and her doctor prescribed metoprolol 50 mg twice daily. She went into the hospital for gall bladder surgery and was discharged home with a prescription for Lopressor 50 mg twice daily. Upon returning home, she resumed her metoprolol dose and began taking Lopressor as well.\n\nWhat she did not realize is that metoprolol is the generic version of Lopressor which means she was suddenly taking a double dose of her blood pressure medication. She was back in the hospital only days later because of a fall due to low blood pressure.\n\nSolution: Anytime a new medication is prescribed be sure to inform your provider of ALL medications you are currently taking and make sure there are no conflicts or overlapping meds. Don't forget to mention over the counter meds and vitamins too!\n\nTiming: If a medication is prescribed more than once per day, the amount of time between doses is very important. Upon returning home from the hospital, the second time, Lynda was now only taking metoprolol twice daily so she thought she was on the right track. She would take her second dose with her supper at 5:00. Her next dose would not be until she woke up the next morning around 8:00. This meant that there were 15 hours between doses! It is no surprise that he was waking up each morning with a headache and high blood pressure. After a particularly stressful morning, she decided she would go to the emergency room.\n\nSolution: Make sure to space your medications as evenly apart as possible so there are not big gaps between doses. By simply moving her last dose to bedtime instead of with supper, Lynda was able to wake up feeling great!\n\nIn Lynda's case, the cost of simple medication errors really added up when you calculate the stress anxiety and financial impact of two avoidable hospitalizations.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have a TeleHealth Coach through CareCycle Solutions, you know that these are exactly the kinds of clues we are watching for 24 hours a day.

I liked the boxart and the unusual, dramatic poses of the figures and i had a rough idea what i could do with them. A scene with German mountain troops and Soviet naval troops was also very interesting to build, the combination is quite unique. These troops fought each other in the Kuban Bridgehead for example, thats where this scene is located.\nFew weeks ago i watched the movie \"Cross of Iron\". In this movie there is a scene where they fight in a destroyed factory building which inspired me a lot. I decided build a similar scene using those figures.\n\nYou can find a thread about the construction process on the ISM forum (Modelling Works In Progress - Figures):\nhttp://www.intscalemodeller.com\n\nThe figures are awesome, not too expensive, great poses and easy to assemble. I only added the straps on the guns using paper and instant glue. I painted the miniatures with acrylic paints from Revell and Lifecolor.\nThe ruined smoke stack is made out of plaster and from Verlinden. The destroyed metal stair is from MiniArt. The pipes are made out of a copper tube. The other pieces of the debris are left over pieces or selfmade. The rubble for example is made out of chunks from a smashed brick stone, earth, chunks of plaster and 1/35 scale brick stones from Juweela.\nTo achieve the dusty look i used Vallejo pigments, mainly \"iron oxide\" and \"burnt sienna\".\n\nThe Kuban bridgehead (German: Kuban-Br\u00fcckenkopf), also known as Gotenkopf (Gothic head), was a German retreat position on the Taman Peninsula, which existed from January to October 1943. It had originally been held by the Germans after the retreat from the Caucasus to allow a new attack on the oil fields of the Caucasus. After the withdrawal of the German Army to the Panther-Wotan line, the troops located in the bridgehead were evacuated across the Strait of Kerch to the Crimea. The German 17th Army under the command of Generaloberst Richard Ruoff, later under the command of General der Pioniere Erwin Jaenecke, was tasked with the defense of the bridgehead.\n\nThe Kuban bridgehead was held despite repeated Soviet attacks during this period. This enabled the evacuation by sea, using the Marinef\u00e4hrprahm, of 239,669 soldiers, 16,311 wounded, 27,456 civilians and 115,477 tons of military equipment (primarily ammunition), 21,230 vehicles, 74 tanks, 1,815 guns and 74,657 horses to the Crimean peninsula. The Luftwaffe further evacuated from the bridgehead 15,661 men from an airfield at Slavyansk-na-Kubani. The withdrawal was one of the few military withdrawal operations of the Wehrmacht in which the entire Army Group and all its heavy equipment was not lost.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nI don\u00b4t own the rights for the music in this video.\nMusic: \"Spetsnaz theme\" from the game \"Call of Duty: Black Ops\"", "title": "\"Who\u00b4s that?\" diorama (Kuban Bridgehead spring 1943) 1/35 scale", "publishedDate": "2014-01-06T13:01:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_QcRYHm8JU", "description": "When plenty of room to move is at the top of your priority list, look no further than this spacious family residence located in one of the best streets in Sans Souci.\n\nThe 'Welcome!' you receive from the manicured front yard is just the beginning.

It is found in the open fields and grasslands of tropical Asia and is popular as a cage bird due to the colourful plumage of the males in their breeding season. It breeds in the Indian Subcontinent in the Monsoon season. The species name of amandava and the common name of avadavat are derived from the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat from where these birds were exported into the pet trade in former times.This small finch is easily identified by the rounded black tail and the bill that is seasonally red. The rump is red and the breeding male is red on most of the upper parts except for a black eye-stripe, lower belly and wings. There are white spots on the red body and wing feathers. The non-breeding male is duller but has the red-rump while the female is duller with less of the white spotting on the feathers.The Red Avadavat were earlier included in the genus Estrilda by Jean Delacour. This placement was followed for a while but morphological, behavioural, biochemical[6] and DNA studies now support their separation in the genus Amandava.[7][8][9] The Estrildinae are thought to have evolved somewhere in the Indian plate and moving into the African and Pacific regions and it has been estimated that the Red Munia diverged from the Green Munia about 9 mya.Red Avadavats are found mainly on the flat plains, mainly in places with tall grasses or crops often near water.[4] The species has four named populations. The nominate subspecies is found in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan; the Burmese form has been called flavidiventris (also found in parts of China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam);[11] the population further east in Java is called punicea and in Cambodia decouxi.[12][13][14][15]\n\nIntroduced populations exist in southern Spain,[16] Brunei, Fiji,[17] Egypt,[18] Malaysia, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore and Hawaii.This finch is usually seen in small flocks,[21] flying with rapid wingbeats and descending into grass clumps where they are hard to observe. Pairs stay together during the breeding season.[22] These birds produce a distinctive low single note pseep call that is often given in flight. The song is a series of low notes.[23] Birds of a flock will preen each other, ruffling their head feathers in invitation.[24] They feed mainly on grass seeds but will also take insects such as termites when they are available.[25]\n\nThey build a globular nest made of grass blades. The usual clutch is about 5 or 6 white eggs.The beak begins to turn red in May and darkens during November and December. The beak then turns rapidly to black in April and the cycle continues.[27] These seasonal cycles are linked to seasonal changes in daylength.[28]\n\nTwo ectoparasitic species of bird lice (an ischnoceran, Brueelia amandavae, and an amblyceran, Myrsidea amandava) have been identified living on them[29] and a paramyxovirus has been isolated from birds kept in Japan.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_avadavat#cite_note-pcr-4", "title": "Strawberry Finch @ Bishan Park 1 in front of Grub Cafe-Singapore", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T04:51:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_SG00LT85k", "description": "", "title": "Barium Sulfate and its use in X-ray", "publishedDate": "2012-04-04T22:09:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_SJ9EjGwE0", "description": "New mix this weekend honouring all you amazing people!

Sind viele Monate und durch vielerlei L\u00e4nder gereist. Wir haben Ozeane \u00fcberquert und sind weit in die Unterwelt hinabgestiegen, um das Geheimnis des Mondes zu begreifen und der K\u00f6nigin der Nacht, der Mondfrau, Auge in Auge gegen\u00fcberzustehen.\u201c (FAUN 2014)\n\nDas Mysterium des Mondes\n\nDer Mond hat \u00fcber Jahrtausende die Menschen bewegt. Der Mondzyklus ist seit jeher mit dem Wasser, wie auch mit dem weiblichen Zyklus verbunden und wird in den meisten Kulturen mit weiblichen Eigenschaften besetzt. Dem Gegen\u00fcber steht die m\u00e4nnliche Sonne, die f\u00fcr Kraft und Tatendrang steht. Der n\u00e4chtliche Mond wird mit Intuitionen, Tr\u00e4umen und Gef\u00fchlen in Verbindung gebracht. In unserer Kultur wird oftmals versucht unsere dunkle Seite herunterzuspielen und uns Schuld einzureden f\u00fcr: Neugier, Lust, Tr\u00e4umerei und Leidenschaft. Dabei ist es wichtig, die Kr\u00e4fte, denen wir unterworfen sind, im Gleichgewicht zu halten. Die Gruppe FAUN hat sich aufgemacht, mit ihrem einzigartigen Konzeptalbum \u201eLuna\u201c das mystische Bild des Mondes und der antiken Mondg\u00f6ttin \u201eLuna\u201c f\u00fcr uns aufgehen zu lassen.\n\n\nEin M\u00e4dchen kommt vom Tal ins Dorf\nso lieblich und so fein,\nda sieht der schwarze M\u00fcller sie\nund will ihr Liebster sein.\n\nGeh fort, du dunkler M\u00fcller, du\nund lass mich friedlich sein.\nDen Kranz den dich so lange hielt,\nwill ich mit dir nicht teil'n.\n\nRefrain: Lauf, Liebes, lauf\nund pass gut auf dich auf,\nder Herr der schwarzen M\u00fchle will\ndich heute Nacht zu Frau.

Crabgrass is a type of stubborn rooting grass.  Crabgrass spreads out in thick mats that can choke out regular grass.  Crabgrass also releases a toxin that kills surrounding grass and plants.  If allowed to mature, one crabgrass plant can produce 150,000 seeds.  Each seed grows one new plant and can take over a lawn if it is left untreated.\n\nCrabgrass is easier to control before it emerges.  Crabgrass control prevents the seeds from developing.  If crabgrass is allowed to germinate, it is much more difficult to kill. In most parts of the country you would want to get a crabgrass preventer down from mid March through April.\n\nYou should do all the spring clean up before an application of any of the fertilizers with crabgrass control.  Remove leaves, branches, and other debris.  You need to make sure that you are putting the crabgrass control evenly on the lawn.", "title": "When to Apply Crabgrass Preventer - Spring Fertilizer - Crabgrass", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T18:10:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_cYq256YEA", "description": "Help identifying a research topic and narrowing your topic down to a question which can be researched.", "title": "What is Research : Choosing Your Topic", "publishedDate": "2011-04-21T23:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_clIRcLpcs", "description": "Miles Kane performs 'Hey Bulldog' in an intimate session for O2.\n\nCheck out more videos and subscribe:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/o2academytv", "title": "Miles Kane: 'Hey Bulldog' Session", "publishedDate": "2011-05-17T11:16:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_cngjXfv40", "description": "Brugmansia white&pink 2014.", "title": "Brugmansia White&Pink.", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T21:11:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_dE74KWNHs", "description": "PPP is the Reason for Backwardness of Lyari People", "title": "PPP is the Reason for Backwardness of Lyari People", "publishedDate": "2010-05-14T23:44:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_dqDM-q0Ww", "description": "Level 90 Hunter Solo: Abuse the Ooze. \n\nQuick video on how to get the achievement.

The prototype cycle combines an electric drive and muscle power. Head of Design Wolfgang Egger comments: \"As a high-performance e-bike for sports and trick cycling, it features the Audi core competences of design, ultra, e-tron and connect.\" The Audi e-bike W\u00f6rthersee puts in its first major appearance at this year's W\u00f6rthersee Tour, the 31st meet for Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda fans; trial biker Julien Dupont and downhill specialist Petra Bernhard will demonstrate their stunts and streetbike skills.\n\nAs a high performance e-bike for sports and trick cycling, it features the Audi core competences of design, ultra, e-tron and connect.\" Wolfgang Egger, Head of Design said. The bike looks dynamic, but is also designed to be functional. All design elements are secondary to the technical features. The airy frame boasts a low centre of gravity and a compact overall volume. In this way, the e- bike is agile. The lithium-ion battery is incorporated into the frame and needs 2.5 hours to fully charge and is easily replaceable. \n \nThe frame and the swinging arm that holds the back wheel are made of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). The same material is used for the 26\" wheels, which feature broad flat spokes for an optimized transmission of pedal power. The signature Audi LED lights are also present at the front and back of the bike. For extreme tricks and stunts the seat can be lowered to run flush with the frame itself. At the press of a button, the seat then rises up and the biker can adopt a comfortable position. The electric motor is located at the lowest point on the frame and drives the bottom bracket shaft directly. The maximum torque delivered to the rear wheel is 250Nm. The electric motor generates a maximum output of around 3bhp. The complete bike excluding electrical components weighs 11kg.", "title": "Audi e-bike Official - A bicycle that runs at 80 kmph HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-27T19:21:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_h5Cf3nZhQ", "description": "--20 are dead in a confirmed outbreak of the bubonic plague in Madagascar\n\n--On the Bonus Show: Romanian Farmville fans claim big bucks in government subsidies, A women's rights activist demands a higher female body-count, Zipf's Law, more...\n\nhttp://www.davidpakman.com\nBecome a Member: http://www.davidpakman.com/membership\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/davidpakmanshow\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/davidpakmanshow\nTDPS Gear: http://www.davidpakman.com/gear\n24/7 Voicemail Line: (219)-2DAVIDP\n\nSubscribe to The David Pakman Show for more: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=midweekpolitics\n\nSupport TDPS by clicking (bookmark it too!) this link before shopping on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/?tag=thedavpaksho-20\n\nBroadcast on December 11, 2013", "title": "20 Dead in Confirmed Bubonic Plague Outbreak", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T04:30:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_heggGL270", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Akka Hotel Antedon party", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T20:52:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_hgoMHo2f8", "description": "'Return of The Son'  video footages  has been mainly taken during Abiogenesis performance at the Octave Festival on 13th November 2011 at Margao, Goa and the various beautiful beaches spread across Goa.

When he reached old age and had everything he wanted, and declared himself to be happy and to wish to go on living, he was then snatched away without the sacraments and without atoning for his life and deeds. Like an ant, he used to gather his stores night and day, though not in the storehouse of the Lord. But, when he had reached the entrance of the anthill where he was bringing his grain, he died and left his work for others. He who does not fruitfully gather in the time of harvest will not have the enjoyment of the corn.\nHappy are those birds of the Lord that do not sleep beneath the trees of worldly delights but in the trees of heavenly desires. If ever a temptation of that wicked fox, the devil, lays hold of them, they quickly fly away on the wings of humble confession and the hope of heavenly assistance.\"\n\nEXPLANATION\n\nChrist, the Son of God, speaks: \"This provost is material for the episcopate. Whoever wants to climb the tree of sweet fruit should be free from every burden, girded and ready for gathering, having a clean vessel in which to put the fruit. Let this man seek eagerly now to decorate his body with virtues. He should supply it with the necessities but not the superfluities of life. He should flee the occasions of incontinence and greed and show himself to be a clean mirror and an example for imperfect men. Otherwise a horrible fall will come upon him, a sudden end by the stroke of my hand.\"\nAll this came to pass.\nThe Mother's words to her daughter about a fox, and about how the devil is like a fox, and about how the devil, like a clever fox, deceives people with many and varied temptations, and tries all he can to deceive all those whom he sees making progress in virtue.\nSAINT BRIDGET PATRON SAINT OF EUROPE BOOK 4 Chapter 68 FINAL PART", "title": "ANONYMOUS RESPONSE TO NSA FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND LIES !!!", "publishedDate": "2012-02-24T17:59:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_u42SPZQa8", "description": "Easy Listening (1967)", "title": "James Last - Elizabethan Serenade (Elisabeth Serenade - H\u00f6r mein Lied, Elisabeth)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-20T19:08:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5_uDVD1ARgE", "description": "Learn about me and what I plan to do with this channel!

Start with ASL Snippets #1)\n\nThis ASL Snippet is a very simple joke. The punchline (the funny part at the end) is especially funny because it uses a very particular sign. If you don't know the sign, go back and watch the ASL Snippets video playlist to learn signs you that you don't understand. Hope you enjoy the joke!\n\nFootnote:\n\nAmerican Sign Language is a very rich, complex, and unique language. To accurately learn ASL takes commitment and motivation. YouTube is FULL of videos by individuals who make \"cutesy\" little videos that show random signs and claim to be teaching \"sign language.\" Most of them talk, talk talk, sign, talk, talk, talk, sign.... as a result, they are spreading wrong information about what ASL is and how it is used. Some examples - Melissa Schenk, Ryan Moriarty, Kate Maria, etc. Each of their videos have a lot of views, but for each one of them, the information they are spreading is wrong. And because each one of them gets paid for their videos, not only are they \"teaching\" a language that they know nothing about, they are also making money at the expense of the Deaf. Is it really that big of a deal? What do you think? A minority culture that is often discriminated against and their language treated like some \"cutesy quasi-thing\" that's not a \"real language.\" \n\nIf you have watched and voted thumbs-up on their videos and subscribed to their channels, you're helping to encourage them to continue to take advantage of the Deaf and to wrongly profit off a language that they are teaching wrong. Please, UNsubscribe from them, vote thumbs-down, and leave a comment to encourage others to look for and support accurate sources. Then, take the time to find accurate videos. Ask the video makers where they learned and if they are qualified to teach.\n\nTake a moment to vote thumbs-up and leave a positive comment on videos made by individuals who truly KNOW sign language. Subscribe to their channel and share their videos with others. Please help to actively spread the accurate use of ASL.\n\nOn behalf of the Deaf community and those of us who look to have our language, community and culture get the respect they deserve, I thank you.", "title": "Sign Language Lessons - A funny joke (ASL Snippets #9)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05T00:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a4-eIeagc0", "description": "Subscribe to Baeble for More: http://goo.gl/YYDN5P\n\nQueens based band Gospels dip into a trance in this uniquely unassuming and intensely focused performance in Brooklyn.\n\nCheck out more of Baeble here:\n\nhttp://www.baeblemusic.com\nhttps://twitter.com/baeblemusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/baeblemusic\nhttp://instagram.com/baeblemusic\nhttps://plus.google.com/+baeblemusic/\n\nBaeble will help you discover the best acts of today and tomorrow and quite possibly your new favorite band.", "title": "Gospels Perform \"Willow Lake\" for Baeble", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T19:31:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a45CYltZBU", "description": "", "title": "Satanophobia (Final Cut)", "publishedDate": "2010-04-01T07:08:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a4KPbXTvHo", "description": "\"The propaganda on America's \"Fair & Balanced\" newsroom, Fox News, must be quite effective.

Among them is Zimbabwean artist Kudzanai Chiurai, one of the continent's rising talents, who has won international acclaim for his  scathing, theatrical compositions about African power and corruption. \n\nOther rising stars include famed print and drawing artist William Kentridge.\n\n \"The market and the media is developing an interest, I think the artists were there already. But people are looking around the world, people now know about Latin America, they know about the Middle East, they know about Asia. Africa, you know, is the last continent that's, sort of still reasonably undiscovered,\" said Frieze director Matthew Slotover. \n\nAnother installation featuring a fountain spouting black ink in the middle of a bed is by Lili Reynaud-Dewar, a French artist whose work focusses on the history of the race struggle and the civil rights movement. \n\nAmerican artist Ken Okiishi created a project around the Fair's theme of play and governance with  programmed paint-ball guns shooting pellets at the installation's walls. \n\n\"It was a way of making a kind of compression chamber, of the way that the fair is viewed and kind of the different things that happen all colliding in here. And then, also, in the way that the entire thing is live-streamed so it's also entering the devices that we see things through and send things around with,\" said the artist.\n\nAnother up-and-coming artist featured at this year's Frieze is Colombia's Oscar Murillo. \n\nTwo years ago, his paintings retailed for less than 2.000 euros. Now, the artist - who is being hailed as the new Jean-Michel Basquiat - can expect pieces to sell for as much as 100,000 euros.\n\n\"Well, he is one of these kind of rising stars of the art world, from relative obscurity. But having been with a very good young gallery, (he's gone) up to a bigger gallery. And that involves a jump in price and a jump in interest and he has a show on at the South London Gallery, so there's a kind of perfect storm of interest in him,\" said Ossian Ward, head of content at the Lisson Gallery.\n\nA piece of advice for visitors: take your time. There are more 150 galleries showcasing artworks by artists from around 30 different countries. \n\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "London Frieze Art Fair opens - le mag", "publishedDate": "2013-10-17T18:46:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a7QXG9EmP8", "description": "\u8aac\u660e", "title": "Atlantica Global Mycenae Weekly Final PM Session 2014-09-06", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T00:55:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a7drm1o26k", "description": "\u30a8\u30b8\u30d7\u30c8 \u30af\u30d5\u738b\u306e\u30d4\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\uff5cKhufu Pyramid Entrance", "title": "\u30a8\u30b8\u30d7\u30c8 \u30af\u30d5\u738b\u306e\u30d4\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\uff5cKhufu Pyramid Entrance", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T05:34:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a7lterkjKs", "description": "www.IranPressNews.com", "title": "\u0633\u062e\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0631\u0698\u06cc\u0645", "publishedDate": "2011-02-21T10:56:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a86msuAsjY", "description": "HobbyKidsTV\u2122 presents Legoland Buffet With Emmet and Spider-Man.

This fact reminds you that your city, keeping in mind the magnitude of Delhi, is patrolled by a fleet of less than 1000 PCR vans. Does it bring to you a sense of safety? Yes, perhaps? No, maybe?\n\nLet's analyse the process that follows. Once the PCR van reaches the caller, the role of the PCR van personnel is only to assist the callers to the nearest hospital, police station or to their homes. The filing of F.I.R.s is an isolated process which bears no connection with the officers of the PCR vans.\n\nWe suggest that the officers of the PCR vans should not just be permitted to act as primary witnesses to the situation they help assist, but also be able to register F.I.R.s then and there! They need to become the support system of the cases they assist and ensure their presence in the way towards justice. \n\nWe expect that involving the PCR van officers more in the process of the registering cases and their follow ups would aid the judicatory process, dramatically. This would also help conclude cases more expeditiously.\n\nSign if you support!", "title": "PCR vans should be registering FIR's", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T06:56:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a8UrC65lpk", "description": "Popis", "title": "18. 8. 2014 - \u010cT 1 BBV, \u010cesk\u00e1 olympijsk\u00e1 nadace, Nanking 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T18:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a8WcssLRP0", "description": "When you see this, it's time to call the vet!", "title": "Labored breathing in a cat", "publishedDate": "2013-02-22T16:55:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5a9HvhE_Fio", "description": "Detachment Beats - Showcase EP DOWNLOAD : http://www.sendspace.com/file/cm2emb\n\nArtist: Rema Luda Ku\u0107a / Mla\u0111i Referent\nDetachment Studio Kraljevo https://www.facebook.com/DetachmentMusicStudioKraljevo\nProduced by Detachment Beats [TunnA & Profetesa]\nDOWNLOAD FREE BEATS @ http://www.soundclick.com/detachmentbeats\nContact: Detachment.beats@gmail.com\nFB: http://www.facebook.com/detachment.beats\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Detachment2\n\nPlease DON'T upload the video on other chanels!\nMolimo vas da ne ka\u010dite na druge kanale!

The flat-topped mountain is the headline act, but there are many other equally gorgeous natural landscapes within the park\u2019s extensive boundaries. Cultivated areas, such as the historic Company\u2019s Gardens, Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and Green Point Park, also make exploring the city a pleasure. Follow the lead of locals by taking full advantage of the abundant outdoor space. Learn to surf; go hiking or mountain biking; tandem paraglide off Lion\u2019s Head; abseil off the top of Table Mountain \u2013 these are just a few of the many activities on offer.\n\nDesign Delights\nThe World Design Capital 2014 is in the process of using innovative design to transform the city. It\u2019s already one good-looking metropolis, from the brightly painted facades of the Bo-Kaap and the bathing chalets of Muizenberg to the Afro-chic decor of its restaurants and bars, and the striking street art and innovation incubators of The Fringe and Woodstock. The shack communities of the Cape Flats are a sobering counterpoint, but even in these deprived suburbs there are enterprising projects that put food from organic market gardens on tables, or stock gift shops with attractive souvenirs.\n\nProudly Multicultural\nChristian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and traditional African beliefs coexist in this proudly multicultural city. Given South Africa\u2019s troubled history, such harmony has been hard won and remains fragile: practically everyone has a fascinating, sometimes heartbreaking story to tell. It\u2019s a city of determined pioneers \u2013 from the Afrikaner descendants of the original Dutch colonists and the majority coloured community to the descendants of European Jewish immigrants and more recent Xhosa (isiXhosa) migrants from the Eastern Cape. They all bring unique flavours to Cape Town\u2019s rich Creole melting pot.\n\nBeyond the City\nWrenching yourself away from the magnetic mountain and all the delights of the Cape Peninsula is a challenge, but within an hour you can exchange urban landscapes for the charming towns, villages and bucolic estates of Winelands destinations such as Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. Hermanus is a prime whale-watching location and also a base from which to organise shark-cave diving. Further afield, the delights of the Garden Route unfold with more inspiring scenery to be viewed on thrilling drives down the coast and over mountain passes.\n\nEnjoy Your  Cape Town, South Africa Travel Video!", "title": "Cape Town, South Africa Travel Video", "publishedDate": "2014-07-26T20:24:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5aFoxlW8Nu0", "description": "-Click \"Read More\" for Important News-\n\nCredits :\nUST; Rokurin112\nPose; MikuMikuDimension\nImage; ???

The rhizomes are a pleasant, nutritious and energy-rich food source, generally harvested from late Autumn to early Spring. These are starchy, but also fibrous, so the starch must be scraped or sucked from the tough fibers. In addition to the rhizomes, cattails have little-known, underground, lateral stems that are quite tasty. In late spring, the bases of the leaves, while they are young and tender, can be eaten raw or cooked. As the flower spike is developing in early summer, it can be broken off and eaten like corn on the cob. In mid-summer, once the male flowers are mature, the pollen can be collected and used as a flour supplement or thickener. Cattails have also recently been suggested as a source of oil.\n\nThe boiled rootstocks have been used for increasing urination, or used mashing, to make a jelly-like paste for sores, boils, wounds, burns, scabs, inflammations, and smallpox pustules.", "title": "Edible wild plants: Cattail - Typha (Wilderness Survival skills and courses)", "publishedDate": "2009-09-09T23:36:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5aIIoNszoXY", "description": "Trinamool Congress expects the Congress leadership to keep its \"word\" on removal of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi even as he asserted that Railways is nobody's fiefdom.

Fourteen species are currently recognized, 8 of which are found within the continental USA (one reaches southern Canada), and 6 other little-known species are restricted to Mexico (one reaches Guatemala). Most horned lizard species are well represented in the fossil record by the Pleistocene (1 million years ago, mya), P. cornutum is found in the upper Pliocene (3 mya), and P. douglasi is known from the mid Miocene (15 mya). Three species went extinct in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, long before there were any humans. The genus is thought to have split from an ancestor shared with the sand lizards (Uma, Callisaurus, Cophosaurus, and Holbrookia) during the late Oligocene-early Miocene (23- 30 mya). \n\n \nHumans and horned lizards have shared each other's company for thousands of years. This relationship is recorded from Anasazi, Hohokam, Mogollon, and Mimbres cultures through their use of horned lizard images on pottery, petroglyphs, effigy bowls, figures, and shells. Hopi, Navajo, Papago, Pima, Tarahumara and Zuni cultures portray horned lizards in their ceremonies and stories as symbols of strength. Piman people believe horned lizards can cure them of a staying sickness by appealing to the lizard's strength and showing their respect to the animal. They formulate a cure by singing at a patient's side songs describing the lizards and their behaviors. A horned lizard fetish may be placed on an afflicted person's body during the songs. Native Mexican people also respect horned lizards attributing the words, \"Don't tread on me! I am the color of the earth and I hold the world; therefore walk carefully, that you do not tread on me.\" A Mexican common name for horned lizards is \"torito de la Virgen\" or the Virgin's little bull. This name apparently was given to the lizards both because of their horns and because horned lizards are sacred to many people due to their blood squirting behaviors, otherwise considered weeping tears of blood. \n\nThese interesting lizards were first introduced to European audiences in 1651 by the Spaniard Francisco Hernandez. Hernandez was fortunate to observe a living individual which squirted blood from its eyes -- he noted this behavior in his report on the first scientific expedition to Mexico by Spain. Over a century later in 1767, a Mexican cleric of Spanish descent, Clavigero, also showed his wonder of horned lizards in his illustrated volumes of Mexican history. Still later, in 1828 Wiegmann coined the official scientific generic name Phrynosoma, which is Greek for toad-bodied (phrynos means \"toad\", soma means \"body\"). \n\nSpecies descriptions \n\nHorned lizard species are distinct and easily recognized from each other. Arrangement of occipital and temporal horns on the head are enough to distinguish species, but other features such as number of rows of lateral, abdominal fringe scales and dorsal scale patterns are helpful, too. Color or color patterns generally are not good distinguishing features because these lizards are extremely variable and tend to match the color of the sand or rocks in their local environment. However, color can be used in certain circumstances as stated in species' descriptions below. The geographic ranges described below are based on historic records and do not reflect species' current distributions. Ranges of most species have been severely reduced.", "title": "BIG Fat Horned Lizard (aka-Horny Toad)", "publishedDate": "2010-07-24T04:17:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5aWjnaxwCLU", "description": "Charles Ives: \"Ragtime Dance No. 4\" (1904) Orchestra New England, James Sinclair.  The inspiration for Ives use of simultaneous (and contradictory) musical events was explained by him in his autobiographic ;Memos;: \"As I remember some of the dances as a boy, and also from fathers description of some of the old dancing and fiddle playing, there was more variety of tempo than in the present-day dances.  In some parts of the hall a group would be dancing in polka, while in another, a waltz. Some of the players in the band would, in an impromptu way, pick up with the polka, and some with the waltz, and some with a march.  Often the piccolo or cornet would throw in asides.  Sometimes a change in tempo, or a mixed rhythm would be caused by a fiddler who, after playing three or four house steadily, was getting a little sleepy. Or maybe another player was seated too near the hard cider barrel.

Great perennial gardens come down to plant selection, flower care and a few easily-learned gardening techniques.   Adequate water is the first to ensure your plants thrive instead of just survive.  A good layer of mulch is another trick that will keep a good level of soil moisture and help perennial plants grow.   This may not be appropriate for gardens in damper climates where the mulch encourages snails but it clearly works in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions.   There are a range of other environmental techniques specific to the region and individual perennial plants and these are best learned from local experts.

The Buddha then advised the monks to go back to the same place but armed with the sword of Metta (Loving-kindness) for their protection. The Buddha then delivered this Sutta to teach them how to practice this loving-kindness.\n\n The monks returned to the jungle and radiated their loving-kindness to animals and social people and there\u00adafter they continued with their meditation without any hindrance. These same animals and social sprits who had earlier created disturbances, later repented and paid their respects to the monks.\n\n This is, therefore, an important Sutta for the devotees to recite to radiate their loving-kindness to every living being. By doing so they can overcome any disturbances, find peace and happiness for themselves and help others to live peacefully by practicing this great virtue.\n\n Pali\n\nKaraniya mattha-kusalena Yantam santam padam abhi-samecca Sakko uju ca suju ca Suvaco cassa mudu anatimani\n\nEnglish Translation\n\n He who is skilled in what is good.And who wishes to attain that state of calm.Should act thus.

I'd like to show you one of them today; it's called a Log Mold. \n\nLog Molds are basically wooden containers that contain the viscous soap until it hardens to the point where it can be cut into individual bars. These molds were handmade by a lady I knew but she is no longer in business so you'll have to do some research to find your own log molds. \n\nThis particular mold is a 3 part mold. My favorite feature of these molds is that they have a silicone liner. These give the finished soap a nice smooth finish all the way around. It also makes it a breeze to unseat the soap once it's cooled. Silicone molds are so much nicer than having to line your molds with butcher paper. \n\nThese molds are 3 piece; the mold, the insert and the lid. Once the soap has been poured into the silicone liner inside the wooden mold you place the wooden lid on top. Later, once the soap has hardened completely, you can flip the whole thing upside down and unscrew the side walls.\n\nJiggle the mold a bit and the silicone mold will come free and rest on the wooden lid. Once your upside-down-soap is free from the wooden mold, you can pull the sides of the silicone mold a bit to release the air from the mold. Then you simply have to pull the silicon mold up and viola, your hardened soap log is done and ready for the next step.", "title": "Example of a Quality Soap Mold", "publishedDate": "2011-12-18T00:59:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5aoDfTibNIM", "description": "Subscribe to truTV on YouTube: http://full.sc/1s9KQGe\nWatch Full Episodes for Free: http://full.sc/1rghcLK\nNew episodes Thursdays 9:30/8:30c\n\nMurr confronts a drug store customer who slings some pretty hilarious insults. \n\nIf laughter is contagious, these guys should be quarantined!

The Safari Park has successfully bred over 20,000 rare and endangered mammals for decades (278 of those were ellipsen waterbuck), but this is its first-ever animal born with leucism, a condition that causes an animal to have reduced pigmentation. The three-week-old calf, named Luke, was born on Sept. 6 in the Safari Park's South Africa exhibit.\n \nEllipsen or common waterbuck are recognizable by the bull's eye or ellipse-shaped ring on their rump. In Luke's case, the bull's eye is a brown ring on a white body, rather than a white ring on a brown body. In the wild, an animal with leucism is an easy target for prey as it stands out, unable to camouflage itself. Since Luke was born at the Safari Park, he has a good chance of survival as animal care staff can keep close watch on him.\n \nTypical of waterbuck, Luke's mother kept him from harm by tucking him in the rocks in their habitat for his first two weeks while she rejoined the herd, returning to nurse the calf several times a day. Once the calf was strong enough, she allowed him to venture out with her to meet his herd and the 10 other animal species sharing his habitat, including rhinos, wildebeests and eland.\n\nVisitors to the Safari Park may see Luke and his mother on an Africa Tram tour, included with Park admission.", "title": "Introducing Luke The Leucistic Waterbuck Calf", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T18:52:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ax8tGanepI", "description": "Share to Facebook:  Twitter: http://bit.ly/1f7XQYx\n\nDownload: http://snd.sc/17gFsYB\n\nKUI\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kui-official\n\nHigh Intensity Records \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/highintensityrecords \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/highintenrecs \nSoundcloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/highintensityrecords\n\nFollow & Support Us!\nMerchandise: http://www.smarturl.it/DRAGOONSCALEclothing\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Dragoonscaledubstep\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/dragoonscale\nSoundcloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/dragoonscale\nOther Channel: http://www.youtube.com/trapandbass\nPartners!\nhttp://www.jamvana.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/highintensityrecords", "title": "KUI - Atropine [FREE DL]", "publishedDate": "2013-11-18T12:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5axJ4NLH_Xw", "description": "2012 Carolina Crown - For The Common Good\nhttp://www.carolinacrown.org\n\nOrder your 2012 Drum Corps International World Championship products now!\nhttp://shop.dci.org", "title": "2012 Carolina Crown", "publishedDate": "2012-11-07T20:33:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5axPTtA8HQc", "description": "First of all you need to get raw fish.
