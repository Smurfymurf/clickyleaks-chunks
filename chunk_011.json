The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been one of the most widely kept working  and companion animals in human history.\n\nThe word \"dog\" may also mean the male of a canine species,[2] as opposed to the word \"bitch\" for the female of the species.[3]\n\nThe dog quickly became ubiquitous across world cultures, and was extremely valuable to early human settlements. For instance, it is believed that the successful emigration across the Bering Strait might not have been possible without sled dogs.[4] Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This versatility, more than almost any other known animal, has given them the nickname \"Man's best friend\" in the western world. Currently, there are estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[5]\n\nOver the 15,000 year span that the dog had been domesticated, it diverged into only a handful of landraces, groups of similar animals whose morphology and behavior have been shaped by environmental factors and functional roles. As the modern understanding of genetics developed, humans began to intentionally breed dogs for a wide range of specific traits. Through this process, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[6] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a few inches in the Chihuahua to a few feet in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue'\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[7] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\n\nDog is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris. The term is sometimes used to refer to a wider range of species: it can be used to refer to some belonging to the family Canidae, which includes foxes, jackals, Bush Dog, the African Wild Dog and coyotes and many others; or it can be used to refer to the subfamily of Caninae, or the genus Canis, also often called the \"true dogs,\" which genus includes only the wolf, jackal, coyote, and dog.[8]  Some members of the family have \"dog\" in their common names, such as the Raccoon Dog and the African Wild Dog. A few animals have \"dog\" in their common names but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.\n\nThe English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a \"powerful dog breed\".[9] The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").[10] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga \"frog\", picga \"pig\", stagga \"stag\", wicga \"beetle, worm\", among others.[11] \n\nIn 14th century England, hound (from German: 'hund') was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed that this \"dog\" type of \"hound\" was so common that it eventually became the prototype of the category \"hound\".[13] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[14] Hound, cognate to German Hund, Dutch hond.\n\nIn breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are generally called pups or puppies, from French poup\u00e9e, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp, (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valp, Icelandic hvelpur) .[16]\n\n\u00a9 2009 Tobuscus", "title": "The Needy Dog Song (Now on iTunes!)", "publishedDate": "2009-06-04T09:11:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-d0vJ4vr9ME", "description": "Family & Friends Fellowship Service 2011 with Pastor Jeremiah Johnson - THE LIFE CENTER - 1900 Pinehurst Ln.

The thiazolium ring of TPP is in a zwitterionic form, and the anionic C2 carbon performs a nucleophilic attack on the C2 (ketone) carbonyl of pyruvate. The resulting hemithioacetal undergoes decarboxylation to produce an acyl anion equivalent (see cyanohydrin or aldehyde-dithiane umpolung chemistry, as well as benzoin condensation). This anion attacks S1 of an oxidized lipoate species that is attached to a lysine residue. In a ring-opening SN2-like mechanism, S2 is displaced as a sulfide or sulfhydryl moiety. Subsequent collapse of the tetrahedral hemithioacetal ejects thiazole, releasing the TPP cofactor and generating a thioacetate on S1 of lipoate. The E1-catalyzed process is the rate-limiting step of the whole pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.\nDihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2)\n\nAt this point, the lipoate-thioester functionality is translocated into the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) active site, where a transacylation reaction transfers the acetyl from the \"swinging arm\" of lipoyl to the thiol of coenzyme A. This produces acetyl-CoA, which is released from the enzyme complex and subsequently enters the citric acid cycle. E2 can also be known as lipoamide reductase-transacetylase.\nDihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3)\n\nThe dihydrolipoate, still bound to a lysine residue of the complex, then migrates to the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) active site where it undergoes a flavin-mediated oxidation, identical in chemistry to disulfide isomerase. First, FAD oxidizes dihydrolipoate back to its lipoate resting state, producing FADH2. Then, a NAD+ cofactor oxidizes FADH2 back to its FAD resting state, producing NADH.

Ramses was 'een vrije ziel', zoals Liesbeth List vaak zegt. Dolend, soms eenzaam, maar vooral mateloos gretig en vol tomeloze passie.\n\nCast en creatives\nRAMSES wordt geregisseerd door Michiel van Erp, het scenario is geschreven door Marnie Blok. Acteur Maarten Heijmans kruipt in de huid van Ramses Shaffy. Op zoek naar Mary Poppins-winnares Noortje Herlaar speelt Liesbeth List en Joop Admiraal wordt gespeeld door de Vlaamse acteur Thomas Cammaert. Hij speelde dezelfde rol eerder in de musical Ramses.\n\nVerhaal\nRAMSES gaat over de jonge jaren van Ramses Shaffy en in zijn kielzog die van Joop Admiraal en Liesbeth List. Van begin jaren '60 tot eind jaren '70. Het zijn de jaren waarin Ramses de lieveling wordt van het Nederlandse toneel, Shaffy Chantant opricht en een nationale held wordt. Maar het zijn ook de jaren waarin hij uiteindelijk door drank en drugs ten onder gaat. En het zijn de jaren dat er veel in Amsterdam veranderde. De opkomst van de flower power, de vrije seks, de drugs en een veranderende moraal na de brave jaren '50.\n\nSimone van den Ende\nSimone van den Ende, Hoofd Kunst & Cultuur van de AVRO: \"Ik ben ontzettend blij dat de AVRO deze bijzondere dramaserie gaat maken omdat Ramses een heel belangrijk persoon is geweest voor de Nederlandse cultuur. Ik verheug mij op de eigenzinnige regie van Michiel van Erp die samen met Marnie Blok ook verantwoordelijk is voor het script en daarmee een krachtig beeld schept van de charmante en complexe Ramses Shaffy.\"\n\nRAMSES wordt geproduceerd door De Familie Televisie & Film en is mede mogelijk gemaakt door het Mediafonds. De serie wordt vanaf 11 januari 2014 uitgezonden om 20:20 op Nederland 2.", "title": "RAMSES: Maarten Heijmans - Laat Me", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T09:24:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dDLp3MnQjs", "description": "", "title": "Hyperglycemia", "publishedDate": "2012-08-15T09:21:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dDNzltEi7g", "description": "Watch in High Definition! Here's a video from a few weeks ago. I went out to see Southbound Amtrak Coast Starlight Train 11 as it crossed Stenner Creek Trestle. A few minutes before it passed me, the engineer radioed the dispatcher to report an onboard emergency. An elderly passenger aboard the train was suffering from diabetic shock, and an ambulance would need to meet the train at San Luis Obispo to take him to a hospital. The situation was still developing as the train passed me at Stenner. The train had P42DC 97 leading and P32-8BWH 503 trailing. In addition to the regular consist, the train had five private cars on the rear. The cars were, in order, the Silver Rapids, Silver Solarium, Colorado Pine, Prairie View, and Baton Rouge. The diabetic patient was quickly taken to a hospital upon arriving in SLO and I didn't hear any further. I decided to chase the train south, so I headed down to Edna, located just north of Price Canyon, a few miles south of San Luis Obispo. The train is seen cruising by at track speed with a fresh crew onboard, while slowing to negotiate the curves in Price Canyon.\n\nEnjoy!", "title": "Amtrak 11 at Stenner Creek Trestle and Edna HD", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T06:05:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dEEBAPfN0Q", "description": "", "title": "Normal disfluency Romy and Michelle.MPG", "publishedDate": "2012-12-01T20:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dEVbkDe_bw", "description": "Earlier today Mac Demarco released a music video for Chamber of Reflection off his album Salad Days, one of our favorites so far this year.

things that the British admittedly do better than Americans.\n \nutside of the Revolutionary War, Americans and the British have long had close ties, both politically and culturally.\n\nDespite many similarities, however, there are some things that the Brits admittedly do quite a bit better.\n\nHere are 10 of them.\n\nNumber 10. Paid holidays. The United Kingdom standard is 28 days per year and can include public holidays. That's not a recommendation by the way, it's the law. There's no mandate in the US that requires paid time off be given to employees, and approximately 1 in 4 employees receive none. \n\nNumber 9. Talent show judges. Nothing against J-Lo, Harry, or Adam, but Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan, and Sharon Osbourne do have a particular knack for laying down some truth.\n\nNumber 8. High-profile weddings. Even the most lavish Hollywood celebrity nuptials can't match the grandeur and excitement of a royal wedding. Between the media coverage, the guests' fancy hats, and dazzling accessories pulled from the Queen's collection, there's not much else like one on the planet. \n\nNumber 7. Fictional Spies. James Bond, created by British author Ian Flemming, has earned a significant place in literary and cinematic history. The franchise has also become the gold standard of the genre, with its lavish settings, ingenious spy toys, and maniacal adversaries. \n\nNumber 6. Taxis. The Brits not only have Americans beat on this one, but apparently they've risen above everybody in the whole world. Hotels.com has bestowed the honor of world's best taxis to the black fleet that serves London. New York did come in second, but it wasn't close. \n\nNumber 5. Attracting billionaires.The UK has the greatest number per capita in any country of seriously high monetary worth individuals. They total 104, with 72 of them living in London.  Notably, California, which has fewer residents than the UK, has 111 billionaires, but it's not a country, perhaps to the dismay of many of its residents. \n\nNumber 4. Afternoon tea. The genteel habit of taking an afternoon break and enjoying pastries, light sandwiches, and, of course, tea is alive and well in Britain. Some US hotels offer the experience, but let's face it, Americans are more likely to spend their afternoons in line at Starbucks. \n\nNumber 3. Castles and Palaces. True, this is not really fair to the US with no royal rulers and therefore no royal residences, but the UK has so many fabulous ones, like Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and Windsor Castle, they deserve a mention. \n\nNumber 2. In July 2013 Britain opened the largest offshore wind farm in the world, capable of producing 630 megawatts which they claim will provide enough energy to serve over 500 thousand homes. There are currently no offshore wind farms in the US.  \n\nNumber 1. Chicken Tikka Masala. Perhaps seeking refuge from their own, often-bland cuisine, Brits have consumed enough of the Indian fare to make it the most popular meal choice in the country. It's even been dubbed the 'true national dish'. Given the immense amount of practice they have preparing it, finding better options in the US is unlikely.", "title": "10 Things British Do Better Than Americans", "publishedDate": "2014-05-21T13:40:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dXcimQ0QTs", "description": "Great bit of retro pain relief:\n\nhttp://www.retroist.com", "title": "Anacin Commercial - Woman Screams at Her Child", "publishedDate": "2008-08-24T02:01:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dXs6BWdRPE", "description": "Echotip Ultra Aguja de Endoscopia, se utiliza para obtener muestras de lesiones predeterminadas de la submucosa gastrointestinal a trav\u00e9s del canal de accesorios de un endoscopio.", "title": "GASTROENTEROLOGIA - ECHOTIP ULTRA (AGUJA DE ECOENDOSCOPIA) - COOK (3 DE 7)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T00:45:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dXtfxDdTDY", "description": "Sugar cane juice", "title": "Popular Indian Juice -Sugar Cain Juice In India", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T11:16:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dYLouRsqoc", "description": "lente espelho  retrovisor fiat punto multijet. cel.(11)8950-3543Cel \"Cel (programming Language)\" \"Bile Salt-dependent Lipase\" Romania Bmw Rally Auto Rallying Subaru Automobile Drift \"Auto Rickshaw\" Audi Turbo Tuning Golf Turbocharger Opel Renault Peugeot Astra Volkswagen Mitsubishi Exhaust 16v E30 Race Occasion Sound E36 Seat Burnout Mercedes Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-AMG Vr6 Ford Skoda Polo Citroen E46 Drifting Passat Motor Motorsport Racing Vauxhall Hatch Ibiza Wrx Brands Porsche Lancer Lenny Acceleration Colin Cars", "title": "Lente Espelho  Retrovisor  INSTALADO cel.(11)98950-3543", "publishedDate": "2011-10-25T21:42:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dYTYj51XU4", "description": "The Spiral Sallet is a hat for all classes.

The skin is now being marked to display the anterior cervical triangle which is bordered by the clavicle inferiorly and the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid medially and laterally.\n The area is now prepped with Chlorahexidine swab and sterilely draped keeping the ipsilateral nipple exposed.  This is the dual lumen dialysis catheter kit.  At this point 1% lidocaine is drawn up to be used for anesthesia and is now being injected to anesthetize the skin and underlying soft tissue.  As the needle is advance, constant negative aspiration is utilized so we don't have an intra-arterial injection.  The left hand is palpating the carotid pulse, and the finder needle is inserted just lateral to the carotid pulse aimed at the ipsilateral nipple.  The finder needle is left in place.  The introducer needle is then introduced just posterior to the finder needle at 30 to 40 degree angle to the skin again aiming at the ipsilateral nipple.  As the introducer needle is advanced in the soft tissue space, constant negative aspiration is utilized until good venous blood return is obtained.  Once you have good venous blood flow, the hub of the needle is grasped, the syringe is rotated and withdrawn and we assure that we have non-pulsatile purple venous blood flow.  The wire is then introduced into the needle. It currently is being introduced in the wrong direction with the curve directed laterally, so with this method the wire is probably entering the right subclavian vein and at some point they're going to meet resistance.\n The wire therefore is withdrawn back into its container.  A syringe is then re-introduced onto the needle and we assure that we have good venous blood return and we again introduce the wire, this time the wire is advanced with the curve directed medially, which is the proper direction with a right internal jugular catheter placement.\n The wire is advanced without any resistance.  If resistance is felt at any point the wire has to be withdrawn.  However, this time the wire is being introduced without any resistance.\n Ideally, with either subclavian vein or internal jugular catheter placement, constant cardiac monitoring is preferred to assess for any atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias that occur while the wire is in place, as the wire can sometimes be advanced into the right atrium or right ventricle.\n The needle has now been removed, the wire has been left in place, and the scalpel is used to knick the skin.  A dilator is now introduced over the wire which is being held distal to the dilator and the dilator is advanced with a twisting motion, being held at the proximal end.  After a subcutaneous tract has been dilated, the dilator is removed, and the catheter is now advanced over the wire.  The catheter has been pre-flushed with saline in both of its ports.  The wire is withdrawn into the catheter until the wire can be grasped at the distal end of one of the hubs, which is always the blue hub in the dual lumen dialysis catheters.\n The catheter is advanced all the way to the blue hub and then the wire is removed and the port clamp is clamped.  \n Now each of the ports is flushed with saline.  The syringe full of saline is introduced onto the hub, and then the port clamp is unclamped, it is flushed and then reclamped.\n Each of the ports is flushed until it is completely clear without any blood.  Heparin 1,000 units per ML are also used to keep each of the ports patent and each port is filled with a pre-designated amount of concentrated heparin after it is flushed with saline.  The hub is then secured to the skin on two sides with suture as being shown here.  Multiple passes are made through each side of the hub and a surgeon knot is made on each side.\n This is carried out on both sides so that we have the catheter secured to the skin in two locations.", "title": "Internal Jugular Line Video", "publishedDate": "2012-09-01T17:10:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-dgn5NQcFqo", "description": "BUY \"THAT GIRL IS MINE\" ON ITUNES NOW!  \nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/that-girl-is-mine/id561693620?i=561693621\n\nClick 2 Tweet:  http://tiny.cc/tgimofficial\n\nHi BBoys and BGirls!

Sometime during the 15 month gap that separated the two releases, Konami decided to tweak the soundtrack.\n\nFor their second attempt they added new (and more driving) percussion parts, and all sorts of reverb/ delay effects that weren't there before. Other differences can be heard as well, including a different length for A Requiem and a different bass part for Within These Castle Walls.\n\nIts neat hearing how the original version sounds, but I much prefer the changes they made for the American release.

Stuck in the mire of a disappointing season, the New York Knicks did what no other NBA team had thought about doing. They gave backup point guard Jeremy Lin an opportunity to prove himself. He took full advantage, scoring more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in the modern era, and created a legitimate public frenzy in the process. Prior to this now-legendary run, Lin had faced adversity in his career at every turn.

together.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (2012)\nCast: Raymond Burr, James Stewart, Grace Kelly\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://amzn.to/tNQmpO\nProducer: James C. Katz, Alfred Hitchcock\nScreenwriter: John Michael Hayes, Cornell Woolrich\nFilm Description: Laid up with a broken leg, photojournalist L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as \"Miss Torso\" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.\n\n\"rear window\",\"rear window clip\",\"rear window part 1\",\"rear window trailer\",\"rear window full movie\",\"rear window 1954 part 1\",\"rear window movie\",\"james stewart\",\"grace kelly\",\"raymond burr\",\"wheelchair videos\",\"classic thrillers\",classics,\"crime thrillers\",mystery,\"psychological thrillers\",thriller,\"alfred hitchcock\",\"james c katz\",\"love videos\",\"apartment videos\",\"l b jeff jefferies\",\"lisa carol fremont\",\"lars thorwald\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++40584,/m/0gt3p,/m/044qx,/m/0bq1z", "title": "Rear Window (1/10) Movie CLIP - When Am I Going to See You Again?

And she likes it.\n\nNixon Caldwell has served his time in the Marine Corps, surviving two brutal tours in Afghanistan. He is back home, surrounded by what he likes best...isolation.  It's certainly the easiest way to avoid confrontation of the consuming guilt that is weighing him down.\n\nWhen an accident brings Emily and Nix together, he soon learns he is not the master of his own fate. Struggling with his own pain, Nix tries to guard himself against Emily's charms.  He wants her in his bed, but he doesn't want her in his heart.  \n\nHaving grabbed life by the horns, Emily wants it all.  But is she willing to accept just the small part of himself that Nix is offering?  Or can she reach the part of his soul that he has deemed to be Off Limits?", "title": "Book Trailer - Off Limits by Sawyer Bennett", "publishedDate": "2013-04-15T13:52:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-eBgr-ggPFE", "description": "Ninja 250 vs 450 Dirt Bike - Race\nKawasaki Ninja 250 vs 450 dirt bike.\nCRF 450r vs Ninja 250 race\nRace Ninja 250 vs 450 dirt bike.\n\nThe first race was won by the Ninja 250, but the 450 dirt bike did some bad shifts.\nAll of the rest of the races where won by the 450 dirt bike.\n\nPwnsJones Pwns Jones", "title": "Ninja 250 vs 450 Dirt Bike - Race", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T17:32:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-eBlkPMiNSI", "description": "David Young is a partner at DLA Piper.

This is the 4.7\" Spigen Ultra Hybrid review. One of the reasons I love this case is its low price and if you click the link above in the description it'll take you to the best price on Amazon where you can order this case for yourself. The reason I bought the Spigen Ultra Hybrid for my iPhone 6 is because I had the same exact case for my 5s and I loved it. My 5s is still in perfect condition thanks to that case so let\u2019s go over the best features of this new Spigen Ultra Hybrid for the iPhone 6. It\u2019s called a Hybrid because it\u2019s a perfect blend of a slim bumper and a full enclosed case, so you get good overall protection for your iPhone while keeping it slim and not adding much bulkiness. This case has a transparent back and this is the crystal clear model where the bumper is clear too, but they do have other colors available for the bumper. I love having a clear back because it shows off that nice iPhone design while keeping it protected at the same time. Now if you get this case please remember to peel off the clear protective film on the inside and outside of the case. A lot people don't realize that there are 2 clear sheets on this case and they think that the case is scratched, but really it's just the clear film that needs to be removed. Once the 2 sheets are removed the case is crystal clear with no scratches. It's made of a soft yet strong thermoplastic polyurethane so it's flexible enough to be able to put the phone in easily but also durable enough to provide good protection. It has Air Cushion Technology on the corners of the case so if you drop your phone the air cushion absorbs most of the impact in order to keep your phone safe. It raises up just enough on the front so you can lay your phone face-down on a surface and not worry about it scratching the screen. It also has the same feature on the back where the 4 corners are slightly raised so you don't scratch or smudge the clear back panel of the case when you move it around on a surface. It has all the precise cutouts for the headphone jack, microphone, lightning port, speakers, and vibrate switch. The volume buttons and power button are protected and have embossed symbols so you can feel where they are. The buttons are pretty easy to press and you can feel and hear when they are pressed which is nice. The cutouts for the lightning port and headphone jack are actually big enough to support most third party accessories like certain headphones or docks. The grip is pretty good too, and it does feel nice in the hands. As far as the protection goes, it handles small to medium drops very well, just like the previous version. So if you're not careless with your phone for the most part but you have the occasional drop when getting out of your car or walking like I do, this case will provide good enough protection for that. Overall, this case is perfect for people who want something slim that offers good protection while showing off the back of the iPhone 6. Also it's a lot cheaper than the Apple case. This is my primary case and it is highly recommended. I hope this video helped you out and helps you find your perfect iPhone 6 case!\n\nSubscribe! http://goo.gl/RqU0nl\nTwitter http://Twitter.com/slye\nFacebook http://Facebook.com/MyTechMethods\nGoogle+ http://goo.gl/WHzrbV\nInstagram http://instagram.com/slye\nWebsite http://MyTechMethods.com\nShare this video! http://youtu.be/-eTQdDoc8Yg\nThanks for watching:\nBest iPhone 6 Case?

The lyrics are a synthesis of cliches and (as well) are offered as subtitles to scenes of disruption dislocation war and famine. (All factual...tho the doc-simulating shots are \"stock\" footage, a general feature of mid-late 30s \"Left Wing' film.)\n\nBut the message of social callousness and uprooting is delivered more powerfully (than by words) by the situation of the singer \"Xiaohong\", played by Zhou Xuan. We  are to fathom her as a fugitive from war and occupation in Manchuria (the homeland in her song): which means she has taken to the road stripped of family   trying to support herself my a mix of begging and singing (not shown: the trope alludes also to prostitution). She has (thus) been sold into a quasi-brothel, the \"???-upstairs-tavern\" where she performs this song. Her owner is the tavernkeeper, whose wife is a procuress - enough said: this is all very like Dickens' Oliver. (the 195? musical). \n\nHer slavery (as magnet for cash) is revealed first by the salience of the clappers (bangzi) in the (recorded/non-diegetic) sound. They fix her performance - freeze it - such as to minimize rubato - conveyed sentiment. The same tool also reappears in the lyrics as metaphor:\n\n\"Spring comes, and the window fills with green\n\"A maiden sits by the window embroidering a pair of mandarin ducks\nSuddenly, a heartless blow\nSplits the ducks in two\". \n\nThe translation (A Jones, 2000) skirts round the double-meaning of \"heartless blow' - \n\u5ffd\u7136\u4e00\u9635\u65e0\u60c5\u68d2\uff0c\n\u6253\u5f97\u9e33\u9e2f\u5404\u4e00\u65c1\u3002\n\n\"A flurry or onslaught of wooden cudgels  - \u68d2 - peri homonym =  \u6886:  the former usually meaning the clapper-sticks carried by the nightwatchman - suggests clapper stick(s). A clue as to the non-musical ideation lurking in the compulsion that songstresses also keep meter by banging sticks.\n\nThis is just the sort of clever or better double entendre that one expects from Tian Han", "title": "\"Clapped in Lyrical Prison\" - Street Angel Xioahong Singing \"Song of the Seasons\" (1937)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-02T17:40:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-edByX2kNY0", "description": "", "title": "Startup Weekend First Timer - Descriptive Video Version", "publishedDate": "2013-12-04T22:17:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-edTGJ8DlhI", "description": "Subscribe for every single full walkthrough on every single major upcoming release and every single gaming trailer as soon as it's live: http://bit.ly/WTMIRO\n\nMetal Gear Solid 5 and Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes Fox Engine tech demo at GDC 2013 from Kojima.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 5 trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRSZy12EOSs\n\nMetal Gear Solid 5 gameplay - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uzTw9jF0jA", "title": "Metal Gear Solid 5 Fox Engine Tech Demo", "publishedDate": "2013-03-29T10:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-edfXLlJZu8", "description": "This is a practice routine to improve straight potting. line up 6 redes about 18 inches infront of the baulk line and pratice potting them into the top corner.\n\nif you miss one go back and start over again. once you can pot all six sveral times you can either increase the distance or add more red balls.\n\nits a nice routine but you need lots of concentration and patience", "title": "Snooker 6 long straight reds", "publishedDate": "2010-03-08T23:16:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-eeL9zy79nQ", "description": "Malgorzata Ratajczak Malgorzata Grela Janusz Ratajczak wyst\u0119p Sarbinowo Okud\u017cawa", "title": "Pi\u0119kna Pani zesp\u00f3\u0142 TRIM", "publishedDate": "2007-10-30T23:10:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-eeNFvE3HKY", "description": "This one is much easier than Now It's Istanbul.

All companies large and small should think about video marketing as a part of their future campaigns \u2013 video content is shared more than all other types of online content so if you get it right it will soon be spreading your message across the world.  To put it simply, if you don\u2019t use video marketing you are getting left behind.\n\nDon\u2019t be tempted to make long videos which go on . . . and on . . . and on. \n\nInstagram has proved that this is entirely unnecessary \u2013 short 15 second bursts of quality video content can get the message across effectively and easily. This type of video is so easy to share.\nWhen you are planning your video marketing campaign and speaking with a video marketing company there are a few things to bear in mind:\n\n* Rather just one stand alone video think about making a series to get your message across \u2013 keep your clients wanting more\n\n* Speak to your customers and ask them what things they would find most useful in your video content\n\n* Keep an eye on your viewer stats regularly\n\n* Don\u2019t rush into things \u2013 take it slowly and get it right\n\nAnd a few things to avoid:\n\n* Auto play video on the landing page of a website can be extremely annoying and a big turn off \u2013 so don\u2019t do it\n\n* Only use your real boss if he is an on-screen natural \u2013 even if you are the boss \n\n* Don\u2019t drone on and on and on . . . keep it snappy and to the point\n\nVideo marketing companies really can help your business to thrive.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdUXQ3bY8o8\n\nSee what Wikipedia has to say about video advertising\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_advertising", "title": "Online Video Advertising Marketing Agency - Jyllion", "publishedDate": "2014-08-15T10:11:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ehLpwRtO8k", "description": "National treasure Sung-Bong Choi sings the Korean national anthem for Korea's athletes ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, UK.\n\nExclusive content can be found on:\n\nTwitter - @sungbongchoidot\nBlog - sungbongchoidotcom.blogspot.com", "title": "Sung-Bong Choi sings national anthem for Olympic athletes for London 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T21:13:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ehPjdvtiQU", "description": "Watch more How to Hula Hoop videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/512723-Behind-the-Back-Vertical-Hooping-Hula-Hooping\n\nLearn how to do a hula hoop helicopter from hula hooping expert Natalie \"McFancy\" Wise in this Howcast video.\n\n\nFor your helicopter, you're going to start with your palms up, pinkies together, with the hoop in front of you. You're going to let go with one hand, rotate the hoop so that your wrist is forward, so we're going from up to forward, and as the hoop goes around behind you, you're going to rotate your palm down all the way to where the hoop is vertical behind your back. So, you can see what that looks like. You can see the hoop is vertical behind me.\n\nLet's go over that first half again. This is just the first half. Palms up, wrists forward, wrists down, and then my elbow rotates all the way around so that my hoop is vertical behind me. So, then to pass up, my right hand is going to come in with my thumb up and grab the hoop underneath my left hand\n\n Let go with the left, then you're going to allow the hoop to continue rotation around, unwinding that right arm, wrist is now facing forward, wrist up, and now I'm back to the front again.\n\nSo, slow motion. Wrist up, wrist forward, wrist down, behind your back, thumbs up, let go, reversing that rotation, wrist back, rotate forward, palms up.\n\nSo, continuously, behind your back, and front. Rotate back, rotate front. I'll do this a couple of times facing the back so you can see what my hands are doing behind my back, because that's really the trick.\n\nObviously, you should reverse the direction as well. Then, whenever we get that hand passing off really smooth, then you can smooth out the whole helicopter. It will look really sleek.

Malt refers to the process by which you germinate barely to make some of the sugars in the actual cereal grain more accessible. When you sprout it, when you germinate it, it's called malting the barley. \n\nYou set it, you let it soak, and it starts to form the seed. The little green tail comes out, then you set it out and you dry it. That starts a enzymatic process by which the longer more complex starches get turned into sugars which are more easily digestible to yeast, which will give you the sugar you need to turn into your alcohol. \n\nGrain on the other hand is a more involved process and requires, you know you take mechanical action to really grind it down and make your longer chain starches into more available sugars. Malts generally, it's the same way you make beer. \n\nEven in Scotland when they make the whiskey, they start it and they call it the small beer. It's a non-hops beer basically. Which explains why Scots are so good at making whiskey and so terrible at making beer. On the other hand when you have a grain whiskey, even a bourbon for instance, where you make that out of corn, they take longer to ferment, there's less available sugar, and you get a very strongly different, strongly contrasting end-product. \n\nBarley's tend to be rounder, a lot softer on the tongue, and they'll take on a lot more character from the different processes by which they're made, whereas grains tend to taste more or less like grains. I mean rye tastes like rye, tastes like rye - you can get different expressions, but that sharp spicy quick character that you get from the rye grain is pretty universal. \n\nYou can get different expressions, but really it's going to taste more or less like rye. Mostly the same way that bourbon really tastes, it's either soft or sweet or it's aggressive and higher proof with more rye in the batch. So that's a quick run-down of malt versus grain.", "title": "Malt Whiskey vs. Grain Whiskey | Whiskey Guide", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T05:05:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ejJ1qIr5-A", "description": "", "title": "Front Escutcheon", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T00:18:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ejQI20SrBM", "description": "", "title": "Envision Technocracy", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T12:31:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ejlmWKdi3c", "description": "Live in Chicago", "title": "Ween - The Mollusk Lollapalooza 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-08-09T18:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ek0IWmqTqM", "description": "Muhammad Ali's seen here preaching the preservation of race. \"It's nature!

Levin, Mike Nichols, Duncan Reid, Scott Rudin\nScreenwriter: Patrick Marber\nFilm Description: Patrick Marber's acclaimed stage drama about the romantic interactions of four people has been given a reverent screen adaptation by director and producer Mike Nichols. Dan (Jude Law) is a writer in London who wants to finish a novel, but in the meantime supports himself by writing obituaries. One day he chances upon Alice (Natalie Portman), a beautiful young American expatriate, working as a stripper, when he sees her get hit by a car. Alice immediately falls for Dan, and gives him her love without reservation. Dan is initially enchanted with Alice, and returns her affection, but while she inspires him to write his novel (based on her life), her neediness begins to wear on him. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer who is hired to take a portrait of Dan for the dust jacket of his book; Dan is attracted to her easy confidence, and while the two of them flirt, Anna soon (inadvertently through Dan's playful machinations) meets Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, and marries him. Dan can't get Anna out of his mind even though she's married, and the two become lovers, but Dan is frustrated by the fact that Anna is reluctant to leave Larry for him. Patrick Marber wrote the screenplay for this adaptation of Closer; it was the playwright's first feature-film credit.\n\ncloser,\"closer clip\",\"closer ne yo\",\"closer kings of leon\",\"julia roberts\",\"natalie portman\",\"jude law\",\"clive owen\",\"champagne videos\",\"cigarette videos\",\"glass videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,romance,\"steamy romance\",\"scott rudin\",\"celia d costas\",\"mike nichols\",\"duncan reid\",\"john calley\",\"cary brokaw\",\"paul a levin\",\"james clayton\",\"michael haley\",\"robert fox\",\"paula jalfon\",\"mary bailey\",\"adultery videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++303603,/m/01r93l,/m/03v3xp,/m/09l3p,/m/046zh", "title": "Closer (2/8) Movie CLIP - Anna's Photo Exhibition (2004) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T18:15:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ep6eZXMoxY", "description": "Hello internet!

To have a skin tag of the genitals can be a very upsetting thing to experience, and to seek methods of removing a vaginal skin tag, can leave the patient seeking the services of a genito --urinary specialist causing extreme embarrassment to the person who has them.

The fiber is almost pure cellulose. The botanical purpose of cotton fiber is to aid in seed dispersal.\nThe plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.\n\nThe fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and Pakistan. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that so lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.\n\nIndian cotton scenario\nIndia was recognised as the cradle of cotton industry for over 3000 years (1500 BC to 1700 AD). India produces finest and beautiful cotton fabrics since time immemorial. India, being the earliest country in the world for domesticated cotton production and manufacture of cotton fabrics, has led today's first in cotton cultivated area and second in production among all cotton producing countries in the world next to China (as per production record in 2009 - 10).\n\nIndia is the 15th largest economy in the world with a GDP of USD3.319 trillion and a GDP per capita of USD2,900. In 2008, the textile sector contributed about 14% of industrial production, 4% of the GDP and provided direct employment to over 33 million people. The textile sector is the second largest provider of employment after agriculture. \n\nCotton is one of the principal crops of India and plays a vital role in the country's economic growth by providing substantial employment and making significant contributions to export earnings. The cotton cultivation sector not only engages around 6 million farmers, but also involved another about 40 to 50 million people relating to cotton cultivation, cotton trade and its processing. \n\nCourtesy: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Yet, D Major has his own artistic style; which features cross over between Lovers Rock, Reggae, R & B and Soul. You can't ignore the fact that his style has also given D Major recognition as a fashion icon.\n\nIn recent month, Jamaica's The Gleaner own tabloid STAR wrote \"D-Major is now more than a great voice on a record; there is now a handsome face to go along with it.

For example, in Christianity, many people study The Imitation of Christ and ask themselves, \"What would Jesus do?\"\n\nIn the secular world, I suspect, people often read biographies for spiritual reasons: they want to study and learn from the example of great lives. As a writer, I steeped myself in the lives of Winston Churchill and John Kennedy, and it seems to me that much of the fascination in these two towering figures comes from people's desire to imitate their great qualities (though of course they both also had some not-so-great qualities).\n\nOprah is a spiritual master for a lot of people; also, I think, Warren Buffett. Some lucky people have found a spiritual master within their set of personal relationships.\n\nFor my happiness project, I decided to study and imitate a spiritual master\u2014but whom? I didn't feel a particular affinity for any potential masters, until I came across St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux. I'd become interested in St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se after I saw her praised in Thomas Merton's famous memoir, The Seven Storey Mountain. I'd been so surprised to see the cranky, monkish Merton write reverently about the sappily-named \"Little Flower\" that I was curious to read her spiritual memoir, The Story of a Soul. Since then, I've developed a mini-obsession with St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. I have almost twenty biographies of her, and Indulging in a (not so) modest splurge, I spent $75 on a book of photographs of her. Ah, St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se! She is the perfect spiritual master for me \u2014 the fact that I'm not Catholic doesn't change that.\n\nWhat figure would you choose to be your spiritual master? It might be obvious to you; it might take you some serious reflection. Once you've identified a spiritual master, try to learn more about his or her life; think about why you picked that particular figure; and, most important, how to incorporate the lessons of that life into your own life.\n\nFor example, when I was annoyed when the woman working next to me at the library kept sighing noisily, I was inspired by St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: she tells the story of how she once broke into a sweat at the effort to conquer her annoyance when a fellow nun made maddening clicking noises during evening prayers.

L'aluminium est le m\u00e9tal le plus courant de l'\u00e9corce terrestre ; ne s'agissant pas d'un m\u00e9tal noble, on ne le retrouve cependant pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat pur. Une des mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res les plus importantes pour le traitement de l'aluminium est la bauxite.\nCe min\u00e9ral rouge-brun est entre autres pr\u00e9sent en Australie, en Guin\u00e9e, au Br\u00e9sil et en Jama\u00efque.\n\nLa fabrication d'aluminium \u00e0 partir de bauxite se fait en deux \u00e9tapes : toutes les impuret\u00e9s du minerai sont tout d'abord \u00e9limin\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 obtenir de l'alumine pure (oxyde d'aluminium). Le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d'\u00e9lectrolyse par fusion suivant permet alors d'obtenir le m\u00e9tal.\nL'aluminium pur est un m\u00e9tal blanc argent\u00e9, relativement souple, tr\u00e8s mall\u00e9able et d\u00e9formable.\n \nL'aluminium poss\u00e8de une bonne conductivit\u00e9 \u00e9lectrique et thermique. Il est relativement insensible \u00e0 l'humidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'oxyg\u00e8ne atmosph\u00e9rique.

L'aluminium est trois fois plus l\u00e9ger que l'acier et peut s'associer sans probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 de nombreux autres mat\u00e9riaux. Il r\u00e9siste pendant des dizaines d'ann\u00e9es aux intemp\u00e9ries et impacts environnementaux de tous genres.

One of the biggest parts of SEO is understanding keywords. Keywords are what millions of users type into Google search everyday. Of course, Google tracks all of this information, but is nice enough to aggregate it into a few useful tools. With SEO and keywords the idea is if you're starting a site you want to incorporate keywords that aren\u2019t competitive, but still get a lot of searches. When we say competitive, it just means a lot of sites are trying to get on the first page of google for that keyword search.\n\nOne way to research this is with Googles keyword planner. The tool comes with a free adwords account. Adwords is Google\u2019s paid search advertising program, the stuff that shows up at the top and side bar of search results. What we\u2019re looking for is the keyword planner. Lets open it up. You could spend days with this tool, but we\u2019ll do a brief overview. Let\u2019s start with, \u201cSearch for new keyword and ad group ideas\u201d. These tools are built for use with adwords, but they also work for Organic keyword ideas.\n\nIn the first box we\u2019ll type \u201cSexy Costumes\u201d, for our sexy costume website and click \u2018get ideas\u2019. We want to look at the second tab, \u2018keyword ideas\u2019. On this page we\u2019ll see other keywords related to \u201csexy costumes\u201d, along with the monthly searches and competition. What we want to do is find some keywords that have a decent amount of searches with low competition. If you look at the average monthly searches you see it\u2019s quite skewed toward halloween, duh.\n\nCompetition is how many people are bidding on a certain keyword, and a bid is how much they will pay for a person to click on their ad. This is for adwords, but it\u2019s also a good gauge for organic search competition. If we search by competition we\u2019ll see the usual suspects, sexy nurse, firefighter, zebra, but we\u2019re looking for an outlier, something with a decent number of average searches but low competition. Dig a little deeper and sort by monthly searches and go through a few pages, and we find our outlier. Sexy ghost Costume, with an ok number of monthly searches and only low competition, plus a lower suggested bid, which also means less competition. That would be a great keyword to optimize a page for, not sure about the actual costume though, we\u2019ll talk optimization in the next lesson.\n\nHmm, should I search my name? OK Cami Li, and I can see how many people are searching for me and what phrases they use. Uh ok, I guess people want boobs and tattoos, cmon guys I have a brain too!\n\nThere\u2019s also a tool called Google Trends that lets you see search trends over time. Let\u2019s add the sexy costumes term and we can see the graph, with the obvious halloween spikes, we can also sort by region and see related search queries in the bottom, the rising queries is also a good place to look for keyword ideas to put into your site. Next we\u2019ll talk more about optimizing your content and I\u2019ll optimize all this.", "title": "Understanding Keyword Research for SEO", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T21:58:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-fLDU4b7H_I", "description": "I have nothing to say in the description.\nGive credit to:  ferexes \nOnly give me 45% of credit.", "title": "Put your flank in the air, Disco (SFM)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T04:45:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-fLFHEi5a94", "description": "Ivan Carter re-caps a close call from a recent hippo hunt in the Selous.", "title": "Hippo Charge", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T15:55:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-fLPSkMv3ww", "description": "After my little break, can i present the Nightcore Version of \"Pyromania\" from Cascada\nHope you like it^^\nLyrics:\n(Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania\n Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania)\n\nCall me obsessed, call me insane\nSomething is creeping through my veins\nEyes cannot see, what's underneath\nI can't stop and you can't stop me\n\nI'm gonna get this fire started\nImpossible for you to breath\nThe temperatures rising up, up, so hot\n'Cause I'm burning up\n\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah,\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\n\n(Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania\n Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania)\n\nI must confess a thousand degrees\nBring out the beast inside of me\nDon't be afraid, go into the place\nIt's gonna melt your fears away\n\nI'm gonna get this fire started\nImpossible for you to breath\nThe temperature's rising up, up, so hot\nAnd I'm burning up\n\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\n\n(Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania\n Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania\n Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania\n Pyro, pyromania, ma, ma, ma-mania)\n\nSoon as the fire is running wild\nI will surrender to Fahrenheit\nAnd I don't want to apologize\nIt's getting hot, hot and I'm burning up\n\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah,\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah,\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow,\n\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow\n\nPyromania, pyromania, ow\nPyromania, ah, ah, ah, ow\nPyromania, pyromania, ow, ow, ow", "title": "Nightcore - Cascada - Pyromania", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T00:18:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-fLSI9dm5us", "description": "When it comes to marijuana-infused edibles, there really can't be too much of a good thing.\n\n\"Marijuana in America: Colorado Pot Rush\" --  Premieres Wednesday, February 26th at 10p ET/PT\n\nABOUT THE SHOW:  Colorado made history as the first state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

For those who are just a little nervous, we use Nitrous Oxide.\n2. Oral Conscious Sedation: With oral conscious sedation you'll be given a pill about an hour before your treatment. Usually Halcion or Valium is used for this, so you'll feel relaxed and drowsy. You will remain awake and be able to talk to the dentist and the effects can last for up to four hours. It is usually used with the person who has only mild anxiety about their procedure or a visit to the dentist.\nUsing oral sedation your dentist will find a level where you are awake and relaxed. The problem with this form of sedation is that it is hard to control simply because not everyone reacts to medicine in a predicable way. If more is needed the effects take up to an hour to realize and can last longer once your treatment is completed.\n3. Intravenous (I.V.) Sedation: If undergoing a dental procedure with no recollection appeals to you, you'll want to talk about I.V. sedation. I.V. sedation allows you to sleep through your procedure, is fast acting and can be increased or decreased while you are asleep allowing the dentist total control of your comfort.\nIf you are one of the millions who is afraid of receiving dental treatment, I.V. sedation will let you sleep right through your treatment. You'll feel no pain; you will not hear, smell or taste anything, and you will have no memory of the procedure. This level of sedation is predictable, comfortable, and ensures that your dental treatment can be easily completed. Recovery is simple and quick.", "title": "Explain sedation to me, please.

The back of the Backswimmer is often quite colourful whereas the underside is dark. Backswimmers hunt for prey in ponds using their hind legs as paddles to propel themselves through the water. Their fore-legs are used to grasp their prey and draw it to their mouthparts where a dissolving / paralyzing venom is injected by their piercing / sucking mouthparts. People can be bitten by them as well if they are mis-handled or someone chooses to swim in their pond. Backswimmers may also fly to other ponds when the need arises due to shortage of food or shrinking pond size. See more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVmyLeqBRrQ \n\nThis is an aquatic insect called backswimmer -  swims upside-down. Back up , Back down. They feed on small aquatic invertebrates sucking body fluid from its prey  - Backswimmers are strong fliers and, like their cousins the - Water Boatmen -  may be attracted to lights. Backswimmers, which are predators, swim upsidedown, and water boatmen, which are scavengers, do not. \n\nThe powerful oar-like hind legs are modified for swimming; they are long, flattened and fringed with hairs. The forelegs, which are short and strong, are used for grabbing prey. The larvae, or 'nymphs', are white or greenish in colour and are fairly similar in appearance to the adults. See more: http://www.arkive.org/water-boatman/notonecta-glauca/ \n\nBackswimmers swim on their backs, vigorously paddling with their long, hair-fringed hind legs and attack prey as large as tadpoles and small fish They can inflict a painful \"bite\" on a human being (actually, similar to a mosquito \"bite\", it is a stab with their tubular mouthpart).  See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notonectidae \n\nWhen in motion the rear legs resemble the oars in a rowing boat.  This gives rise to its other common name of 'Greater Water Boatmen' Their ventral sides are covered with hairs which trap air and give the insects a silvery appearance in the water.  Adult Backswimmers are able to fly.  They hunt their prey by floating motionless on the water surface.  When they detect movement in the water they swim towards it to see if it is worth catching.  The bite from a Backswimmer can be painful as their saliva is toxic. Backswimmers should not be confused with the very similar looking insect called the Lesser Water Boatman (Corixa punctata).  The Lesser Water Boatman swims on its front and feeds on algae.

Historians are not so sure now that the wooden horse was true. More of a war fought for prized items from that important trade-route and port of call. Shame really as it is a great story from one of the inventors of drama, and a great plan and operation  master-minded, I'm sure, by Odysseus himself.\n\nFROM THE RUINS OF TROY\n\nIn the midst of the ruins of Ilium \nI abducted, in three woody cradles, \nthree tiny infants. I would plant them \nin Chiswick far from the windy Hellespont. \nIf they germinate, I thought, those acorns \n        from the Trojan oak, I could amuse \n        my friends;  invoke the heroes \n        of that siege;  jerk a thumb \n\nto the east and conjure up the field \nwhere Hector, Ajax and Achilles perished:  \npreparations for a future time - then forgotten.  \nBut all of four years on, beside the shed, \nin a standing pot I noticed, one perfect, \n      green sproutling!

They are related to hawks, falcons, and vultures. Eagles have long held a special place in the human imagination because of their strength and soaring flight. The golden eagle has been a symbol of power since ancient times. The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States.\nSince ancient times the eagle has been used as a symbol of strength and courage. This large bird of prey has been admired for its powerful appearance and majestic, soaring flight. The Sumerians chose it as their emblem of power 5,000 years ago. So did imperial Rome many centuries later. Today the bald eagle is the national bird of the United States.\neagle, any of many large, heavy-beaked, big-footed birds of prey belonging to the familyAccipitridae (order Falconiformes). In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An eagle may resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live prey. They are too ponderous for effective aerial pursuit but try to surprise and overwhelm their prey on the ground. Like owls, many decapitate their kills. Because of their strength, eagles have been a symbol of war and imperial power since Babylonian times. Their likeness is found on Greek and Roman ruins, coins, and medals.\nEagles are monogamous. They mate for life and use the same nest each year. They tend to nest in inaccessible places, incubating a small clutch of eggs for six to eight weeks. The young mature slowly, reaching adult plumage in the third or fourth year.", "title": "hunting bird", "publishedDate": "2014-03-30T08:38:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-fzEFx8gBtc", "description": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CNA2BV6\nChamois cloth - detail your car like a pro with the Chamois King car wash chamois\n\nDetail Your Car Like A Pro:  The New Chamois Drying Towel Leaves Your Car Spot Free\n\nchamoisAre you tired of streaks and spots on your car after washing and drying?

With the establishment of the Silk Road between China and the West in the 2nd century BCE that lasted well into the 16th century, many Jews flocked to Central Asia and played a great role in its development. After their exile from Israel in 135, they came under the Persian Empire, as they prospered and spread through the area. However, around the 5th century, they were persecuted. Famous Jewish academies in Babylon were closed, while many Jews were killed and expelled (See Mishnah). After Arab Muslim conquest in the early 8th century, Jews (as well as christians) were considered Dhimmis and were forced, among other things, to pay the jizya head tax.

Supported by a team of experts Ambry G-Nome ascended to 102,900 feet in a Argopheric balloon and made a freefall jump rushing toward earth at super fast speeds before parachuting to the ground. His successful feat on March 26, 2014 holds the potential to provide valuable research data for future gnome pioneers.\n\nThe Ambry Argonaut team brings together the world's leading minds in genetics, bioinformatics, engineering, genetic counseling, capsule creation and balloon fabrication. Retired United States Air Force Colonel Joseph Kittinger, was the first to do a similar jump from 102,800 ft in 1960, Joe ascended in helium balloon sent up from the back of a pick up truck. He wore a pressurized suit on the way up in an open, unpressurized gondola similar to the one Ambry G-Nome used. No gnome has ever attempted anything like this before and it was unknown if a gnome could survive a jump from the edge of space. But with a lot of hard work and dedication from Ambry's finest and thanks to a little help from our friends over at High Altitude Science we were able to make this a successful mission. On his Journey Ambry G-nome managed to sneak aboard a dna sample that full genome sequencing was performed on, making this the first sequenced genome in space.\n\n\nwww.AmbryGen.com\n\n\n\nwww.HighAltitudeScience.com", "title": "First Sequenced Genome in Space...", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T14:57:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-gQCw0m3f8Q", "description": "Learn how to do the Learn how to do the ulnar flexions exercise properly.

Le jet priv\u00e9 \u00e0 bord duquel le patron du groupe fran\u00e7ais avait embarqu\u00e9 s'est \u00e9cras\u00e9 au d\u00e9collage apr\u00e8s avoir percut\u00e9 une d\u00e9nneigeuse sur la piste, selon ces agences, cit\u00e9es par LiveNews et Russia Today.\n\n\nLes circonstances exactes de l'accident sont encore confuses. C'est lors du d\u00e9collage, aux alentours de 00h10 (heure de Moscou), que le jet priv\u00e9 du PDG de Total -un Falcon 50- aurait heurt\u00e9 sur la piste un v\u00e9hicule de type chasse-neige au niveau du train d'atterrissage. Le pilote a \u00e9mis des signaux de d\u00e9tresse juste apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9coll\u00e9 pour gagner Paris, indiquant que l'un des moteurs \u00e9tait en feu et que le fuselage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9. Contraint \u00e0 un atterrissage forc\u00e9, l'appareil s'est alors \u00e9cras\u00e9 sur la piste. L'appareil aurait pris feu apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre renvers\u00e9. Il semblerait que quatre personnes se trouvaient \u00e0 bord (dont trois membres d'\u00e9quipage \u00e9galement de nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise). Selon Life News, les secouristes ont retrouv\u00e9 les quatre corps dont celui du PDG de Total. Les conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9o \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s mauvaises ce lundi au dessus de Moscou et pas moins de 18 avions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9rout\u00e9s vers d'autres a\u00e9roports moscovites, selon Itar-Tass. Elena Krylova, porte-parole de l'a\u00e9roport a confirm\u00e9 dans la nuit que parmi les corps retrouv\u00e9s, on comptait celui de Christophe de Margerie.\nChristophe de Margerie, the head of French oil giant died that night in a plane to Moscow Vnukovo airport accident. \nChristophe de Margerie 2014 death \nChristophe de Margerie 2014 murder \nChristophe de Margerie murdered in 2014 \nThe appearance Christophe d 'de Margerie 2014 \ninjury Christophe de Margerie 2014 \nplane crash at Vnukovo airport in Moscow \nChristophe de Margerie 2014 accident", "title": "Christophe de Margerie, PDG de Total meurt tragiquement", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T00:58:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-gUC7ZQTp34", "description": "Epinephrine is a hormone and neurotransmitter.

At times they all happily swim together in one shoal. \nA tetra is one of several species of small freshwater fish from Africa, Central America and South America belonging to the biological family Characidae and to its former subfamilies Alestidae (the \"African tetras\") and Lebiasinidae. The Characidae are distinguished from other fish by the presence of a small adipose fin between the dorsal and caudal fins. Many of these, such as the neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi), are brightly colored and easy to keep in captivity. Consequently, they are extremely popular for home aquariam.\nTetra is no longer a taxonomic, phylogenetic term. It is short for Tetragonopterus, a genus name formerly applied to many of these fish, which is Greek for \"square-finned\" (literally, square-winged).\nBecause of the popularity of tetras in the fishkeeping hobby, many unrelated fish are commonly known as tetras, including species from different families. Even vastly different fish may be called tetras. For example, payara (Hydrolycus scomberoides) is occasionally known as the \"sabretooth tetra\" or \"vampire tetra\".", "title": "Tetra shoal.
