It is generally followed immediately by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane to form two daughter cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis consists of four phases: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. At the onset of Prophase, chromatin condenses together to form chromosome. \n\nThe nuclear membrane and nucleolus starts disappearing and the centrosomes, containing a pair of centrioles, start moving to opposite ends to form spindle fibre. During metaphase, the spindle fibres begin to interact with the chromosomes, and the centromeres of the chromosomes align the chromosomes at the equatorial plate or metaphase plate. Kinetochore of the replicated chromosome is pointed toward one side of the spindle. Anaphase follows metaphase in which the spindle fibres shorten and the centromere splits. \n\nThe separated sister chromatids are pulled along behind the centromeres and move to opposite sides of the cell. In telophase, the sister chromatids are almost over to the other end of the cell. Cytokenisis finally cleaves the cytoplasm making two daughter cells that are identical.

He highlighted the program\ufffds importance to companies hiring young people and creating jobs.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nMr. Speaker. Among the many programs which others have talked about that would be blown up with this measure, the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program which is one of the most successful aspects of the health care law, will be blown up. Over 5,000 employers all across America, over half the Fortune 500 companies, like Coca-Cola, General Electric, UTC, General Dynamics have all signed up with this program, which using the same principles as flood insurance is buttressing and strengthening early retiree benefits which have been collapsing over the last 20 years. These are the companies that will go out and hire people, particularly young people because early retirement allows their work force to actually have its natural change so that young people can find jobs. The economy created 200,000 jobs last month. It's because of programs like the early retiree reinsurance program which the health care law created - we should not end that program by passing this resolution. These employers have signed up in good faith and that good faith deserves our commitment to follow through on the program that this country offered them. That's a strategy - that's a winning strategy to create jobs for this country.", "title": "Courtney Stands Up for Early Retiree Reinsurance Program", "publishedDate": "2011-04-14T21:56:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATwTZORLSBo", "description": "zingt ----Ik telde al jouw tranen ----", "title": "De Zingende Zeeman  Urk", "publishedDate": "2008-12-19T18:38:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATwVW01uxzQ", "description": "", "title": "017 steady wiggler and find center line", "publishedDate": "2011-12-03T23:53:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATwrtvoUEW4", "description": "Sounding the Accordion\nJen\u0151 Tak\u00e1cs\nPlayed by Acoustica's \"Pianissimo\" piano\n\nPiano Repertoire 5\nCelebration Series Perspectives\u00a9\nThe Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited\nwww.frederickharrismusic.com", "title": "Sounding the Accordion", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T22:51:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATy4DMivjkY", "description": "This is an alternative, fast, and humane way to dispatch chickens or other poultry.

Your doctor may advise limiting their use until the outbreak is under control.\n\nTip\nOver time your skin can become resistant to traditional treatments; consult a doctor before using more aggressive treatments.\n\nStep 2: Use salicylic acid\nUse over-the-counter and diluted salicylic acid with mineral oil, and then wash it off with a coal-tar soap or shampoo. \n\nStep 3: Avoid washing too much\n Avoid washing too much or otherwise drying out your skin. When you bathe, use bath oil or colloidal oatmeal and bath salts. Dry thoroughly, blotting carefully with a thick towel.\n\nStep 4: Try moisturizer\nApply an ointment-based moisturizer that can control the itch. Avoid cold weather, which can also irritate and worsen the condition.\n\nTip\nDermatologists sometimes use rotational therapies, alternating months of psoriasis drugs and creams, to minimize damaging side effects.\n\nStep 5: Expose to light\nExpose the area to brief ultraviolet light therapy, which can slow down the cell turnover and reduce scaling. Natural sunlight is good, but less controllable so it can worsen psoriasis. \n\nStep 6: Undergo laser therapy\nUndergo laser therapy, which targets only the involved skin patch and eliminates plaques that cause the psoriasis inflammation.\n\nTip\nCalm your life down, refusing to allow yourself to be ruled by emotions that can exacerbate the psoriasis.\n\nStep 7: Take oral or injected drugs\nTake prescription oral or injected drugs, but advisedly, as there can be severe side effects such as life-threatening infections.\n\nStep 8: Moisturize at night\nMoisturize at night and cover the psoriasis with plastic wrap. In the morning remove it and clean away scales, but always avoid cleaning with alcohol.\n\nDid You Know?\nDid you know?

For starters, it's a two-person tent but will also sleep one person very comfortably.  For any backpacker that enjoys a larger tent, this is a viable option for a very large but very light two-person tent.  Pitching this tent could not be easier!  Everything is color-coded and there are basically only two poles to deal with (the main two poles are bonded together in the middle to eliminate confusion and the secondary pole is a short roof pole).  This tent includes the footprint.  That is a great bonus, as most tents charge extra for the footprint.  Using a tent without a footprint will quickly destroy the bottom of the tent.  The stakes that come with the tent are very lightweight and high-quality.  The rainy with vestibule area is very spacious!  The only thing that I would have done differently is included webbing on the outside of the stuff sack.  Not that it's a problem, but I like a stuff sack with webbing to prevent my tent from sliding towards the sides underneath my backpacking while hiking.  That's a minor gripe for such an exceptional backpacker's tent!

They are also known as leiomyomata, myomas or uterine polyps. These fibroids originate from the smooth muscle layer in the uterus and are most often asymptomatic.\nWomen may feel fear or panic when they discover that they have fibroids. Rest assured that fibroids are relatively common amongst women. Thousands of women all over the world have fibroids and these can be treated and cured with the right methods.\nSo, to answer the earlier question\u2026 Yes! Fibroids can be cure naturally.\nThere are several negative effects of fibroids and these may make women feel helpless or discombobulated. Women who have fibroids may experience frequent urges to urinate, excessive bleeding during their menstruation which lasts for a much longer duration. Bad cramps may also occur along with pain in the lower back and a bloated feeling in the abdomen.\nSexual intercourse is also a painful affair. Though fibroids are asymptomatic, women who experience the above symptoms often, should go to their doctor for a check-up. The problem is that these symptoms are so common and women tend to assume it\u2019s the norm to experience these negative effects.\nWomen who have fibroids may experience problems with conception and pregnancy. This often causes depression to those who are trying for a child or who are worried that the fibroids may cause complications such as abnormal labour, miscarriages, scarring, etc.\nThere are several methods that can be used to treat fibroids. They range from over the counter medication to holistic methods which involve changing your diet, consuming herbal products. \nSurgery is also an option if things get too bad. There are a few types of surgeries. Namely, myomectomy, hysterectomy and uterine fibroid embolization. This article will not go into detail regarding each surgery. \nBefore trying medication or any surgery, all women should give the natural method a try. Thousands of women all over the word have gotten rid of their fibroids naturally using holistic techniques and natural remedies. \nEven simple changes to one\u2019s diet can make a world of difference. For example, by being on a diet that is rich in fibre and low in saturated fats, sugar, alcohol and caffeine, women will reduce their estrogen levels. This is crucial because fibroid tissues have a large amount of hypersensitive estrogen receptors. Exposure to too much estrogen will boost fibroid growth. Definitely not a good idea.\nMany people often scoff at natural remedies and prefer to go with prescription medication. This is a mistake. Fibroids usually occur naturally due to imbalances within the body. This situation can be reversed if you restore balance to your body.\nThere are several excellent books on holistic remedies to cure fibroids. Get one, put it to use and you will see results that will not only amaze you but will be permanent. Your health will also improve tremendously.", "title": "Can You Shrink Uterine Fibroids Naturally?", "publishedDate": "2014-11-14T11:07:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AUGr48-iQaw", "description": "Free notes can be copied from here:\nhttp://www.fizzics.org/Pages/Astronomy-notes.aspx\nExplaining the definitions of and the connections between the different units commonly used to measure distances in astronomy where they come from and how they relate to our basic units of measurement.", "title": "What are astronomical units, parsecs and light years?", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T08:10:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "AUGs7QuuAqI", "description": "In this 'how to speak French' video lesson, Alexa conjugates the French verb Aimer (to like/love) in the present tense.

That is when the Chinese Communist Party decided to send in its military, the People's Liberation Army or Jie Fang Jun, [\u89e3\u653e\u8ecd Ji\u011b f\u00e0ng j\u016bn People's Liberation Army] to crush a massive protest by student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square, or Tian An Men Guangchang [\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u5ee3\u5834 Ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n gu\u01cengch\u01ceng].\n\nNow, officially, the Chinese regime has denied it did anything of that sort. And that the students, Xue Sheng [\u5b78\u751f Xu\u00e9 sh\u0113ng students], who were calling for things like democracy, or Min Zhu [\u6c11\u4e3b M\u00edn zh\u01d4 Democracy], were part of a Counterrevolutionary Riot.\n\nBut of course, numerous photos and pictures exist from that day showing that the military rolled into Tian An Men Guangchang, with Tanks, or  Tang Ke [\u5766\u514b t\u01cenk\u00e8 Tank], in a bid to remove the student protestors.\n\nImages like these are why some also refer to Liu Si as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, or Tian An Men Tu Sha [\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u5c60\u6bba Ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n t\u00fash\u0101 Tiananmen Square Massacre]. It's unclear just how many people died, but estimates range from hundreds to up to three thousand.\n\nBut you know, often times, if you ask a mainland Chinese person, especially someone who grew up after 1989, about Liu Si, they will either not know what you're talking about, or just try to dodge that topic.\n\nThat' because the Chinese Communist Party has put in place a heavy censorship about Liu Si, and bans discussion of what happened on Tian An Men Guangchang that day. In Fact, a senior military official claimed several years after the Tian An Men Tu Sha that no civilians were killed at Tian An Men Guangchang in 1989.\n\nTry telling that to this group of mothers who lost their sons and daughters during the Tu Sha. They are still calling on the government to release the details of exactly what happened that day. But for China's leaders, it's still not something they want people to talk about. \n\nThat's it for this China in The News, if you are interested in human rights in China, you may want to see a new movie premiering in New York this week. \"Free China: The courage to believe\" follows the stories of two former Chinese prisoners of conscience and their journeys to freedom.

Not all the best songs in the world have an incredible number of different progression and chord variations. The trick is to be the most creative you can . The song Requiem for a Dream (soundtrack for the movie with the same name) is a perfect example. An amazing song that uses pretty much only 3 chords. And that was what I tried to do here, a decent song that maintains the same progression all over for 3 min but making it sound different in every minute.\n\nI really liked the picture, I think it fits amazingly in this song with the female voices I used once again. \n\nHope you enjoy it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks for all your support , rating the video,add to your favs and leaving a comment\nis always appreciated and helps me a lot. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer : I don't own the original art.

But how can this save you data usage?\n\nApplications use internet data, we all know this. But some use far more than they should for no good reason. You can check what each application uses and you can stop it.\n\nGo to settings and then choose data usage. If you scroll beyond the data usage graph you can see a breakdown of exactly what each application uses in terms of internet data.\n\nIf you press on an app it will break down that usage into two parts, as illustrated by the piechart: foreground data and background data.\n\nForeground data is what you do when you use the app, but background data is all that sniffing around when your device is locked and you're not using it. So if you want it to stop doing that, simply tick the 'restrict background data' option. \n\nThis means that the application only uses background data when it's connected to a wifi source so it doesn't use up your data usage.\n\nThe trade off is that the application may not work properly all the time. It is a trial and error process so give it ago and see what works for you.  \n\nShare this Video:\nhttp://youtu.be/AUbqyXyvihw\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/vgjfelix\nhttp://twitter.com/vgjfelix\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/102060949291380946905/posts\n\n:)", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 Tips and Tricks #23: Restrict Background Data", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T19:40:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AUbtamnC938", "description": "This demonstration presents that the accuracy of the analytical model within Robot Structural Analysis Professional can be maintained when brought back into Revit Structure.

De acuerdo con uno de los relatos, se pregunt\u00f3 a los ni\u00f1os en edad escolar qu\u00e9 flor elegir\u00edan como la flor de su Estado, y este lirio obtuvo el primer lugar.\n\nOtra historia acerca de c\u00f3mo el lirio de seg\u00f3 lleg\u00f3 a ser la flor estatal sostiene que, a mediados del siglo XIX, una plaga de langostas arras\u00f3 Utah y devor\u00f3 las cosechas. Por causa de la escasez resultante, la gente tuvo que racionar los alimentos. Aprendieron, entonces, a ingeni\u00e1rselas para encontrar algo de comer, incluso cavando para extraer y comer la ra\u00edz bulbosa de este lirio.\n\nNo sabemos si el Estado de Utah eligi\u00f3 el lirio por la encuesta hecha entre los ni\u00f1os en edad escolar o por la ayuda nutricional que brind\u00f3 durante la hambruna. De cualquier manera, la belleza de la flor, probablemente, ayud\u00f3 a que la legislatura la eligiera como la flor de su Estado.\n\nPero, si alguna vez viste lirios, entender\u00e1s lo que quiso decir Jes\u00fas cuando dijo: \"F\u00edjense c\u00f3mo crecen los lirios. No trabajan ni hilan; sin embargo, les digo que ni siquiera Salom\u00f3n, con todo su esplendor, se vest\u00eda como uno de ellos. Si as\u00ed viste Dios a la hierba que hoy est\u00e1 en el campo y ma\u00f1ana es arrojada al homo, \u00a1cu\u00e1nto m\u00e1s har\u00e1 por ustedes, gente de poca fe!\"\n\nRecuerda: Dios cre\u00f3 los bellos lirios. Si \u00e9l cuida de algo que est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed un d\u00eda y es tirado fuera al d\u00eda siguiente, \u00bfno crees que pueda cuidar de ti?

Available for the first time in North America, this 13-DVD box set is fully loaded with over 42 hours of entertainment, including all episodes that originally aired from the three Japanese series \u2014 Headmasters, Super-God Masterforce and Victory \u2014 each with their original Japanese audio tracks, English subtitles, and an art gallery.", "title": "Transformers Japanese Collection: The Complete Series w/ Collectible Lithograph (Subtitled)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-15T22:14:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AV6Zos7lSE4", "description": "Certainly, the previous copper wire experiment can be run on a comparative basis in which a first cell would be dosed with a suitable quantity of the Batteryvitamin substance and a second be used as a control.\n\nThe appearance of the two copper electrodes at the conclusion of the experiment would reflect the effect of the Batteryvitamin; with the dosed copper having acquired a hazy gray coloration and the control copper having become darker.\n\nHowever, the experiment takes in the order of 24 hours to complete and the distinction between the two electrodes might not necessarily appear clear cut via the camera. It would therefore be useful to find a way of compressing the experiment's duration to, say, about 4 hours and also to use more convenient materials and simpler test equipment.\n\nIn this regard tin appears to be able to provide an ideal substitute for lead for experimental purposes, also being a group IV element, having the same oxidation states of +2 and +4, possessing almost identical electrochemical potentials at Pb** + 2e (--) Pb - 0.1262 V and Sn** + 2e (--) Sn - 0.1375 V and having similar ionic radii. Both have high hydrogen overpotentials. Tin is easy to handle and is relatively soluble in sulfuric battery acid and can therefore help to provide an excellent perspective on the actual electroplating process within a comparatively short period of time.\n\nThis movie shows a positive electrode consisting of a coil of 97:3 tin-silver solder wire being electroplated onto a negative electrode wire in regular sulfuric battery acid over a period of 8 hours, although 4 hours would have been sufficient. All the metal that can be seen growing on the negative wire originates from the positive. It is much easier to monitor this growth than to measure erosion at the positive electrode.\n\nThe extra time provides a magnified representation of the interesting fractal dendritic development typical of plain acid electroplating, closely resembling mossing sometimes found in lead-acid battery cells, for example, after a period of 5 years. (In commercial electroplating a smooth surface can only be obtained by including metal salts and grain refiners in the electrolyte.)\n\nTEST EQUIPMENT\nRegular 12V automotive battery, for use as power supply; 150 ohm, 2 watt resistor, as current regulator.\n\n\u00a92011 Batteryvitamin.

Zack Bradley (Cook) and Vince Downey (Shepard) have been working at the cavernous Super Club for ten years and counting, but while the ambitious Vince has advanced to the position of head cashier and landed 17 consecutive \"E of M\" awards, laid-back Zack is content to simply sit back and enjoy the company of his fellow box boys. Longtime rivals whose conflicting attitudes as to what constitutes success has led to more than a few conflicts, Vince and Zack find their bitter battle for Super Club supremacy coming to a head when attractive new employee Amy (Simpson) transfers over from another store. When word quickly spreads that Amy only has eyes for the cream of the crop, slacker Zack attempts to clean up his act and break free from his box boy roots while uptight Vince tries to impress by maintaining his top dog position and keep cool in the face of competition.\n\n\"employee of the month\",\"employee of the month clip\",\"employee of the month part 1\",\"employee of the month wtf\",\"dane cook\",\"dax shepard\",\"efren ramirez\",\"sean whalen\",\"tim bagley\",\"marcello thedford\",\"greg coolidge\",\"comic book videos\",\"pen videos\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"late night comedies\",romance,\"michael paseornek\",\"andrew panay\",\"jon kuyper\",\"john sacchi\",\"brian volk-weiss\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++339716,/m/03c1tnc,/m/03g5_y,/m/05pbqf,/m/09prlm,/m/02q01tc,/m/02pjz__", "title": "Employee of the Month (1/12) Movie CLIP - Box Boy (2006) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-26T09:48:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVEzetR4fsE", "description": "No malar or carnaissal tooth abscess seen.

Paul Miller, Galt Niederhoffer, Christina Ricci, Trevor Short, Andrew Sugerman, Andrea Sperling, Fredrik Sundwall\nScreenwriter: Frank Deasy, Galt Niederhoffer, Elizabeth Wurtzel\nFilm Description: Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles with Prozac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay between Prozac Nation's shooting (in 2001) and its emergence on cable-TV and DVD is all too easy to understand. -\n\n\"prozac nation\",\"prozac nation clip\",\"prozac nation part 1\",\"prozac nation full movie\",\"anne heche\",\"erik skjoldbjrg\",\"glass videos\",\"toothbrush videos\",\"independent dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"social issue dramas\",\"avi lerner\",\"danny dimbort\",\"trevor short\",\"andrea sperling\",\"andrew sugerman\",\"galt niederhoffer\",\"lati grobman\",\"christina ricci\",\"ildiko kemeny\",\"r paul miller\",\"fredrik sundwall\",\"jason e frankel\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++255213,/m/01vhb0,/m/01fx2g", "title": "Prozac Nation (11/11) Movie CLIP - Gradually and Then Suddenly (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T12:00:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKS5tNs0PY", "description": "Quick motivational session to calm your nerves.\nwww.HypnosisAudioSite.com/\nwww.ArizonaFamilyHypnosis.com/", "title": "How to Calm Your Nerves: FREE Hypnosis Tip", "publishedDate": "2010-10-24T23:21:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKT9GwJyH4", "description": "", "title": "Tune 5 Dance of the Peasantry", "publishedDate": "2011-08-14T16:43:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKUOO_0wv0", "description": "", "title": "The\u3000Willard\uff1a \uff13Years", "publishedDate": "2010-03-05T12:44:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKcCR36930", "description": "", "title": "negatron", "publishedDate": "2011-07-03T18:10:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKekOyBHCM", "description": "Video not mine, I just uploaded it on Youtube so international fans can see. ^^\nCredits to Nevictory for the video.\nRe-uploaded by jerlynjaerin | @bunnyxing10", "title": "EXO Showtime EP10 - Yixing Horror House Unseen Cut", "publishedDate": "2014-09-27T00:26:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVKi3hfsl4I", "description": "Hoa bo cong anh mang theo bao nang\nEm cho anh mang nang tro ve", "title": "Happy birthday Rubi KN - The way of love and Taraxacum", "publishedDate": "2012-08-13T09:08:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVL1zMILJUQ", "description": "Cette vid\ufffdo a \ufffdt\ufffd envoy\ufffde \ufffd partir d'un t\ufffdl\ufffdphone Android.", "title": "Slalom de pusey 2014 (\ufffdqui 89,91,92,96,98,99,101)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T13:53:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVLPttA0DVg", "description": "For more information, log on to www.channelstv.com", "title": "Ebola Spread: TB Joshua Deny Allegation Of Disease In Church", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T19:01:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVMAIHqbjtw", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehowgarden\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehowgarden\n\nRomaine lettuce likes really cool weather.

This was once the capital of the ancient Golconda Sultanate, and it was built by three dynasties before the Qutub Shahi dynasty moved to construct Hyderabad itself. The ruins that have endured for 800 years are a testament to the great culture Hyderabad was founded upon, and they\u2019re interesting to explore in their own right. It\u2019s said that Golconda was once known for its diamonds and that Golconda Fort was an important part of the diamond trade, making it a wealthy city and an impressive fortress. That legacy is apparent even in the ruins. The architecture of the whole Fort was constructed masterfully, right down to the acoustics: due to the unique architectural structure, if you clap your hands at the entry gate, the sound can be heard at the top of the hill Golconda Fort is situated upon. The fort may be surrounded by high, imposing walls for defense, but inside you\u2019ll find the remains of an ancient community\u2013homes, temples, mosques, and everything needed for everyday life hundreds of years ago. Golconda Fort is a step into Hyderabad\u2019s past life, and exploring it is a great way to experience the history of Hyderabad\u2019s culture.", "title": "Visiting Golconda Fort | Hyderabad Travel", "publishedDate": "2013-09-14T20:44:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVS08gtJ1UA", "description": "\"Move On\" written by Martin Other - Gonzalo Other and performed by THE OTHERNESS.\n\nAll rights reserved.", "title": "THE OTHERNESS \"MOVE ON\" (Lyric Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T17:14:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVS4f0MMYhs", "description": "English Project", "title": "English Project Standard and Non Standard", "publishedDate": "2011-07-12T18:37:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVSL7Mr1z5Q", "description": "", "title": "Cross Florida 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T19:28:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVSZKslvl7M", "description": "Make the competition sweat with your outrageously organized Race Duffel -- it's got a pocket for everything, from shoes to lucky rabbit's foot.

This video is very short and I'd say it's more of a filler video than anything, but I still hope you all like it. I will be vidding Sandra Bullock alot more often because I'm kind of over the Twilight stage, to be honest. I have many videos started, but the holdup in a new upload was because I was working on a Sandra Bullock birthday video, which I created last month. I wanted to be sure I had it done ahead of time so I'm not rushing when July comes. Plus, we'll be moving and I don't know if I'll have internet access or my computer with me, so I transferred that birthday video on my thumbdrive so I could definitely upload it on July 26th. Until then, I'll try to get a couple more uploads in, but enjoy this for now! :)\n\nP.S.

There are 13 species in seven genera.\nAll members of this subfamily have. An elongated body, short legs with webbed toes, a long, powerful tail and a round head with a blunt snout When the otters are found with approximately one meter in length and 22 to 45 kg, the largest member of this family (giant otters and sea otters). As with all martens males are about one-fourth larger than the females. Their fur is either uniformly gray-brown, sometimes slightly mottled and often lighter on the \"collar\" and / or abdomen. They have more than 1000 hairs per square millimeter of the densest fur in the animal kingdom. Through the establishment of the fur - long coat hairs protect the dense, soft undercoat - they can also hold water for longer stays in an insulating layer of air around the body. You can close their little ears and nostrils when they are in water. (Source: Wikipedia)\n\nDie Otter (Lutrinae) sind eine amphibisch lebende Unterfamilie der Marder (Mustelidae). Es gibt 13 Arten in sieben Gattungen.\nAlle Mitglieder dieser Unterfamilie haben einen lang gestreckten K\u00f6rper, kurze Beine mit Schwimmh\u00e4uten zwischen den Zehen, einen langen, kr\u00e4ftigen Schwanz und einen runden Kopf mit stumpfer Schnauze. Bei den Ottern findet man mit circa einem Meter L\u00e4nge und 22 bis 45 kg die gr\u00f6\u00dften Vertreter dieser Familie (Riesenotter und Seeotter). Wie bei allen Mardern sind die M\u00e4nnchen etwa ein Viertel gr\u00f6\u00dfer als die Weibchen. Ihr Fell ist entweder gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig braun-grau, manchmal leicht gesprenkelt und h\u00e4ufig etwas heller am \u201eKragen\" und/oder am Bauch. Sie besitzen mit mehr als 1000 Haaren pro mm\u00b2 eines der dichtesten Felle im Tierreich.

I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making skills. \n\nRight, so now that we've ground, dosed, measured, and tamped, it's time to pull the perfect shot of espresso. Now I wish I could just tell you one thing that would result in the perfect shot, but unfortunately there are so many variables. It's kind of hard to do. But there are a few basic guidelines to adhere to that'll make it easier. One of those is the time of the extraction. You wanna shoot for between 21 and 30 seconds. If it's a little bit fast, you can either tighten the grind, or put a little bit more coffee in. If it's running a little bit too slow, you can coarsen the grind and run a little bit less coffee. And it's always good just to try one variable at a time. So let's see how this looks. First thing I did is flush the group head. You wanna make sure you get any excess coffee out of there so it's nice and clean. Once you put the portafilter in the group head, you want to immediately start the water. Put it in. Alright, so that looks pretty good. It was around 25 seconds. And another visual cue is if it's starting to \"blant,\" which is turn very pale and gush out fast - that's a bad thing. So as soon as it started to turn that color, that's when I stopped it. So this should taste pretty nice. And that's how you pull the perfect shot of espresso.", "title": "How to Pull the Perfect Shot | Perfect Coffee", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T17:10:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVm2OuV2FJk", "description": "A exclusive access to Vin Diesel's Personal Car Collection.\nThese are all his exotic cars.

If you listen and look closely I will explain. You will see a cup in this video and also you will see the edge of the cup, the rim, that forms a circle. When I turn it a little to show the side view of the cup the rim becomes an oval shape and not a circle. You will see and should notice the circle is not a circle any more but more the shape of an oval. The more it is turned to show the side, the more the rim looks oval instead of being circular. \n\nThis oval shape formed by the rim of the cup is basically the ellipse. \n\nThe ellipse is created when a circle is at an angle, when instead of creating a circle it creates an oval in shape, as you will see in this video.\n\nI also show you something else just to give a different view point on how you can see ellipses in real life.\n\nI use a wheel from a child's toy truck, to again help you see the ellipse, when you look at it directly, it's a circle, but as you begin to turn the wheel shape, you can see that it changes form being a circle and is more of an oval shape. It shows once again an ellipse, when you see it slightly turned to the side. If you look at a car you will see that the wheels all look like oval ellipse shapes when viewed at an angle or not directly from the side of the car. Car wheels nearly always look elliptical and not round when you really take a good look at the shapes. If you are interested in drawing cars then please take a look at this web page, http://garethpritchard.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-draw-cars-easy--step-by-step \n\nHello and welcome to this quick video about an ellipse.\n\nI am going to use a cup to show you what an ellipse is.\n\nIf you watch carefully and listen I will explain.\n\nAs you can see this is a cup looking at it from the top down into the inside of the cup. \n\nYou can see that the cup forms a circle. \n\nIf I turn this cup slightly to the side, you will see that that circle is turning to the side.\n\nYou will also see or should notice that the circle is no longer a circle but more of an oval shape.\n\nThe further to the side the cup goes the more of the oval shape becomes apparent.\n\nThat is basically an ellipse\n\nAn ellipse is when you at a circle at an angle and instead of it creating a circle it creates an oval shape like you can see in this video.\n\nI will show something else now just to give another idea of how you might see ellipses or an ellipse in real life. \n\nThis is a wheel off a child's truck as you can see again when you look at it directly on, it's a circle but as you turn it to the side as with all wheels you can see that it's changing shape and it is now becoming more of an oval shape.\n\nThat again, like I have already said, is the ellipse, when you see it slightly turned to the side, it's becoming an ellipse.\n\nIf you look at the car drawing, the wheel in the front is actually showing a wheel with an ellipse, if you look at it, it's an oval shape, it is not round.\n\nThank you for watching this video and I hope that it has helped to help you understand. \n\n\nThank you again, Gareth.", "title": "What is an ellipse?", "publishedDate": "2012-09-29T16:02:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVrth4r9Xl8", "description": "Take a look at HPI's Octane Introduction: http://youtu.be/jqyftFUGWd0\n\nCheck out: http://www.hpiracing.com/en/kit/109073\nThe Savage XL Octane has been through rigorous testing and development be sure to check out the rest of the series of clips documenting the journey from design table to next big thing!", "title": "Savage XL Octane Part 1: Quick starts & LONG Runtimes", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T07:26:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVrxRsmVIDE", "description": "HEIGHT: 6'7''\nWEIGHT: 246 lbs.\nFROM: Manchester, England\nSIGNATURE MOVE: Wasteland\nFIRST WWE GAME: WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2011\nCAREER HIGHLIGHTS: NXT Season 1 winner, Intercontinental Champion\n\nTrained in bare-knuckle brawling on the mean streets of Manchester, England, Wade Barrett brings strength, arrogance and cunning to the ring in equal measure. He's also imbued with confidence and eloquence, character traits that have propelled the cocky young Brit to the top ranks in WWE. \n\nSince coming to WWE prominence as the winner of WWE NXT season one, Barrett has proven that he's not content to merely share the spotlight with his fellow Superstars. He wants total control, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to get it.\n\nAfter winning NXT, Barrett shocked the WWE Universe by forming the splinter group The Nexus and staging a hostile takeover on Raw. The Nexus quickly made their intentions clear following their debut, running roughshod on Monday nights and promoting an agenda of fear and intimidation. Barrett's cold and ruthless leadership proved difficult to withstand. Even the mighty John Cena couldn't withstand the onslaught, first becoming a lackey to Barrett's goon squad and then being unceremoniously ousted from WWE after Barrett ordered his firing.\n\nAfter Cena was reinstated, Barrett jumped over to SmackDown, forming The Corre, intent on dominating Friday nights just as handily as he had Mondays. Shortly thereafter, Barrett defeated Kofi Kingston to become the Intercontinental Champion. He then used The Corre as hired muscle to ensure that he would keep the championship gold until the group imploded along with Wade's Intercontinental Title reign. With no other Superstars at his side, the scheming Superstar employed his self-proclaimed \"Barrett Barrage\" -- a one-man mission of mercilessness that targeted even those at WWE's peak, most notably, Randy Orton.\n\nBarrett remains unchanged in his perpetual search for domination. As long as there is authority, Wade Barrett will be there to not only challenge it, but also uproot it and attempt to take its place. As long as this bare-knuckled Brit is on the prowl, the world of WWE is just a little less safe than it once was.", "title": "WWE '13 - Wade Barrett Entrance", "publishedDate": "2012-09-18T02:28:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVs046XCYNI", "description": "The Police was very nice to us :) \nCheck our other vids and our Facebook Page :) \nhttps://www.facebook.com/footpeggrinders", "title": "Police Getaway Husqvarna SM 125", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T20:34:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVs5PBaplHE", "description": "\u2122\ufe3dNo se te olvide Suscribirte y Darle Me Gusta Al Video\ufe3d\u2122\n\u2122\ufe3dNo se te olvide Suscribirte y Darle Me Gusta Al Video\ufe3d\n\n\u25e3~PAGINA OFICIAL DE FACEBUUK~\u25e5\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ReggaetonParaLosMexicanos\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ReggaetonParaLosMexicanos\n\n\u25e3~GRUPOS OFICIALES~\u25e3\n1: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReggaetonParaLosMexicanos/\n2: https://www.facebook.com/groups/371581056263563/\n\n\u25e3~AGREGAME A MI FACEBUUK O SIGUEME~\u25e3\nhttps://www.facebook.com/raulkilsanchez\nhttps://www.facebook.com/raulkilsanchez\n\n\u25e3~ DESCARGA~\u25e3\n\nhttp://www.sendspace.com/file/84whk5\nhttp://www.sendspace.com/file/84whk5\n\n\u2605T\u03c3d\u03c3s l\u03c3s D\u03b5\u044f\u03b5c\u043d\u03c3s R\u03b5s\u03b5\u044fv\u03b1d\u03c3s\u2605\n\u25baP\u03c3\u044f \u00aeReggaetonParaLosMexicanos\u00ae\u25c4", "title": "Astabajo - Dj Fekz TommyArt'z & Chano Flow \u25ba\u266cAzote Arabe\u266c\u25c4", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T19:07:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVs8bFUu5ok", "description": "Annelies Prins helps you study Lascia il lido.(in b flat; soprano/tenor)", "title": "lascia il lido,Vaccai,Annelies Prins", "publishedDate": "2009-05-21T19:06:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVsHht7rSSo", "description": "(The Sound is Better)\nSomebody asked me, what it was like living in Alaska? \n\nWell, considering the fact that I've only lived here for 10 months and most of that time was spent in a small town (Ketchikan) on an island, my perspective is pretty limited.

Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\n\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and on most smaller land masses \u2014 exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific. More than 20 families are currently recognized, comprising about 500 genera and about 3,400 species. They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to the Reticulated python of up to 8.7 meters (29 ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 meters (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.\n\nMost species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.", "title": "\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e32\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e21\u0e31\u0e49\u0e22 Snake Dish Preparation", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T12:59:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVwAdKMbH6U", "description": "", "title": "Fix Wi-Fi iPhone 4S (Greyed out)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T09:06:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AVwGem5rdkg", "description": "israeli soldiers attack Al Aqsa Mosque - Daily Voice News - Jeruselam\n\n\nLibel: Israel to destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque\nBoth Fatah and Hamas have generated and sustained religious hatred by disseminating the libel that Israel is attempting to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

If You Need To Remove Plantar Warts Fast, Head Over There Now.\n\nAre you a sufferer of plantar warts, if you are then this can be good news for you to know that you can get rid of the warts on the soles of your feet quickly helping to ease the pain on the feet. These painful verrucous sores normally found at the pressure points of the foot. You may feel you have tried everything to get rid of the wart on your own at by seeing a doctor but not all plantar warts are easily gone after treatment for them until now.\n\nSuffering from plantar warts, which occurs on the sole of the foot and can be on the heels or the bottom of your toes, can become very problematic with pain from pressure in these three areas of the foot. You may even see warts on other areas of your foot. Plantar warts formed due to different reasons. However, pressure can cause warts to develop the painful warts, which have a thicker skin around it to a soft center within it. The plantar warts (verruca plantaris) are common and they will not be dangerous to your health.\n\nThere are different types of warts yet they all share the same common cause, which is the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that sits only onto the top layers of the skin caused by the viral infection of the HPV. Moreover, there are a large variety of different cases and causes of the HPV.\n\nAdditionally, there are warts that are on the hands and fingers that are palmer warts and are very common as is the plantar warts with additional thirty-plus different types of warts with their main cause stems from the same viral infection of the HPV. The HPV that causes warts is not the same as the known STD (sexually transmitted disease) which causes genital warts. These warts are not the same as the planter warts come from.\n\nPlantar warts do not look the same as palmer as they can become bigger. Moreover, if the warts are on the bottom of your feet they can be very irritated after standing and walking on them. Until the warts are no longer on the foot, you will continue to be in pain, yet the answer to ridding yourself of such pain is right at your fingertips. All you need to do is follow through and you too can be wart free. Having plantar warts removed is less painful and easier to do then to continue to walk and put pressure on the warts on feet. \n\nFor a more powerful plantar wart treatment, go to http://www.wartremovaltips.com now!", "title": "Need Plantar Wart Removal?

I'm a five time world champion of country dance, working with artists like Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley.  I really hope that you learn how to line dance and experience what it's like to move to America's music, and that's country music.\nSo, one of the dances that you must learn, and it's really called round dancing, what we're doing, what we're about to do, because it goes in a circle but it's a set piece of choreography, a lot like line dancing.  But, no matter where you go in the United States, if you're going to a place that does line dancing, they're probably going to do the Cotton Eyed Joe.  The Cotton Eyed Joe is a dance that you can do with a partner, you could have somebody alongside you, or you can do it by yourself, or you can do it in rows of people.  Sometimes you'll have rows of eight or nine people, all shoulders around each other, doing the Cotton Eyed Joe.  \nCotton Eyed Joe has two variations that I'll show you.  One is stomp, just a stomp stomp.  Kick the same foot back up with the triple step, triple step.  Then, same thing with the other foot.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Yeah, so that goes one, two, a three and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  One, two, a three and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  \nThe variation, depending on the region you are in, to that, is that instead of a stomp, they do a touch.  They go touch across, touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  So depending on the variations so you can see that in the front, I'll either cross my foot over, then kick, then back up.  Cross, kick, triple step.  Cross, kick, triple step.  Or, I'll stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  \nI tend to like to make a lot of noise so I do the stomp.  \nThen what you're going to do after the final triple, you're going to do eight counts of a shuffle, which we've learned in another series here in the line dance series, is a shuffle step, shuffle step, shuffle step, shuffle step.  You're going to do eight counts of that.  So you're going to go one and two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight and it starts over.  One, two, a three, and four.  Five, six, a seven and eight.  One, two, a three, and four.  Five, six, and then you shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle and start it over.  \nAnd again, lines of people.  The more people in there the more fun it is.  Or, you can do it by yourself, cruise around the floor, see other people in a line, hook on up and do the Cotton Eyed Joe.\nWe're going to do this to music right now.  \nFive, six, five, six, seven go.  One, two, triple step.  Triple step, stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick and here we go.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.\nStomp, kick, triple step. Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.   Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, and stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.  Stomp, kick, triple step.   Stomp, kick, triple step.  Shuffle, shuffle.  I'll do the other variation.   Touch, triple step, touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  Touch, kick, triple step.  And shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  And it repeats itself.\nAnd there you have the Cotton Eyed Joe.  \n\"", "title": "How to Line Dance to Cotton Eye Joe | Line Dancing", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T16:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWDrB9ZVMDE", "description": "Light, airy colors and plenty of lighting visually enlarge this small bath.", "title": "Fixer Upper: Visually Enlarge a Small Bathroom", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T10:00:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWE0feqFUeY", "description": "Este video se subi\ufffd de un tel\ufffdfono Android.", "title": "Superman UTN", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T19:31:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWE6UpXQoGU", "description": "Subscribe to Explosm! - http://bit.ly/13xgq7a\nRead Our Comics! - http://www.explosm.net/comics/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/explosm\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/explosm\n\nDescription\n\nCyanide and Happiness delivers daily comics to your face-hole on www.explosm.net since 2005!", "title": "Seashell - Cyanide & Happiness Shorts", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T05:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWEUcRDT6zs", "description": "", "title": "Cirkus Miramar - K\u00e4rleken i klor", "publishedDate": "2011-01-04T16:46:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWEXlH87NcY", "description": "name: www.smartserials.com\n\nserial: E6E1-A145-75DA-772E-096D-3C1A-A6CA-4E82-3C4F-CB01\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE ;)", "title": "PC Tools Spyware Doctor 2013 License Key", "publishedDate": "2013-05-11T22:34:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWEqNvKz0MU", "description": "Yes, 13th century pages from Latin Bibles ... made in England and France.

With wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and psychic son Danny (Danny Lloyd) in tow, frustrated writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances, the manager (Barry Nelson) informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family; Jack thinks it's no problem, but Danny's \"shining\" hints otherwise. Settling into their routine, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny's alter ego, \"Tony,\" however, starts warning of \"redrum\" as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband's behavior and Danny's visit to the forbidding Room 237, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to Jack.\n\n\"the shining\",\"the shining clip\",\"the shining trailer\",\"the shining part 1\",\"jack nicholson\",\"shelley duvall\",\"danny lloyd\",\"stanley kubrick\",\"axe videos\",\"knife videos\",\"classic horror movies\",\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",horror,\"psychological thrillers\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"supernatural horror\",\"jan harlan\",\"mary lea johnson\",\"robert fryer\",\"life and death videos\",\"madness videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++44363,/m/06_x56,/m/09fb5,/m/0421st", "title": "The Shining (7/7) Movie CLIP - Wendy, I'm Home (1980) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T06:05:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWKiZpgxLuA", "description": "anthurium", "title": "anthurium", "publishedDate": "2011-08-18T18:29:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWKzdYRTnrY", "description": "Great sound of the start-up of the 14-cylinder Wright R-2600 engines on the North American B-25 bomber.

Species therein include white-tailed deer, such mule deer as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou) fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year, thereby differing from such permanently horned animals as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may be superficially similar. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded to be deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively. Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native species, the red deer, confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that fawn fawns deer like to eat. frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive. Small species of brocket deer and pud\u00fas of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian Muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America's Andes fill an ecological niche of the ibex or wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids. The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn antelope", "title": "Deer crashes through bus window!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T12:03:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWUs1JGJPtg", "description": "Grabado por el alumnado de Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda y Geolog\u00eda del IES Bocairent, curso 07-08", "title": "protoc1.11", "publishedDate": "2008-01-17T19:36:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWVCir6ubx8", "description": "Scatter chicken droppings for a thaw to wheat.\nUsing ISEKI sial3 tractor with miracle tire and VICON(niplo) mp306.\n\u30a4\u30bb\u30ad\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fcsial3\u3001\u30df\u30e9\u30af\u30eb\u30bf\u30a4\u30e4\u3068\u30cb\u30d7\u30ed\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5c0f\u9ea6\u306b\u9d8f\u7cde\u3092\u6563\u5e03\nby Aky Taniutji\u3000\u8c37\u5185\u61b2\u662d", "title": "Scatter chicken droppings \u9d8f\u7cde\u6563\u5e03", "publishedDate": "2013-03-18T09:41:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWW79cCoAqw", "description": "Follow us on: http://www.howtobuildahouseblog.com\nMusic:  Spring In My Step\nDownloaded it from the YouTube Audio Library\nhttp://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music", "title": "Small Dining Room Design Ideas", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T00:54:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWWEl79YHOk", "description": "Peltier gekoelde nevelkamer.\nDeze innovatieve nevelkamer heeft twee dingen nodig om te werken: iso propyl alcohol en een 230 volt aansluiting.

On Sunday he boarded Chinese \u2013 French challenger Dongfeng Race Team to take part in the Pro-Am event \u2013 and took the opportunity to grab a once in a lifetime shot with a GoPro camera.After climbing the mast in a safety harness, Prince Carl Philip wrote a message for the Volvo Ocean Race sailors at the top. When asked what the message was, the prince was refused to divulge the secret. One of his aides would only say \"You'll have to find out \u2013 it's a message only for the brave,\" he laughed. \"You have to get up there to read it for yourself.\"The Prince was in the company of Swedish compatriot Martin Str\u00f6mberg, the only Swedish sailor competing in the Volvo Ocean Race 2014-15 who is part of Dongfeng's sailing team.Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V\u00e4rmland (Carl Philip Edmund Bertil; born 13 May 1979), is the only son and the second of three children of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden. As of 2014, Prince Carl Philip is third in the line of succession, after his older sister, Crown Princess Victoria, and his niece and goddaughter Princess Estelle. His godparents are Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and Princess Birgitta of Sweden. Carl Philip also enjoys car racing, a passion he inherited from his great-uncle and godfather, Prince Bertil, and has a licence to compete. Prince Carl Philip has taken part in the racing series Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia in a Porsche 911 GT3. In 2013 and 2014 he races in the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship.The Volvo Ocean Race 2014-15's first leg starts in one week on October 11th when the boats will leave on the first leg of the race taking them to Cape Town. It will visit nine other ports before concluding in Gothenburg on June 27th, 2015. The race will again begin in Alicante before heading to Cape Town in South Africa.[7] The Volvo Ocean Race will also stop in Auckland,[8] Abu Dhabi,[5] Lisbon,[9] Itaja\u00ed[10] Sanya,[11] Lorient and Newport, Rhode Island before ending in Gothenburg.The Volvo One-Design (unofficially, the Volvo 65) is the successor to the Volvo Open 70 yacht used in past editions of the Volvo Ocean Race. It was announced at a conference in Lorient, France during a stopover in the 2011\u201312 Volvo Ocean Race. It has officially been announced that the yacht will be used in at least two future editions of the race (2014\u20132015 and 2017\u20132018 editions, respectively), marking the first time in its history that the Volvo Ocean Race will become a one-design event.The 2014\u201315 Volvo Ocean Race will be the 12th edition of the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race. For the first time, the race will be a one-design. The Volvo One-Design was designed by Farr Yacht Design in response to concerns about safety and cost. The Volvo Ocean Race will ensure a minimum of eight boats are built. The aim is to reduce participation cost to around 15 million euros per entry. Defending champions, Groupama, have announced they will not compete again.[3]     Team SCA will field an all female crew. The rules allow all female crews to field three extra crew members. The entry is skippered by British yachtswoman Samantha Davies.[1][4]     Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing return and will again be skippered by Ian Walker.[5]     Team Brunel of the Netherlands have announced they will be entering the competition with seven-time participant Bouwe Bekking as skipper.[6]     Dongfeng of China is a half-Chinese amateur, half-International professional squad skippered by Charles Caudrelier.     Team Alvimedica is the American entry in the race. The Turkish sponsored yacht is skippered by Charlie Enright.     MAPFRE will be the home team to begin the race. The Spanish entry is skippered by Iker Martinez.     The final boat, Team Vestas Wind, is sponsored by wind energy leader Vestas. The Danish registered squad is skippered by Australian Olympian Chris Nicholson.The point standings will be done via low points. The winner of each leg/in-port race will receive 1 point, runner up will receive 2 points, and so on down to the final finisher who will receive 7 points. The organizers also removed the weighting of the open water legs which was deemed to significantly reduce the importance of the in-port regattas.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%...", "title": "100 Foot Mast Climb Prince Carl Philip 20 Hottest Young Royals 4K Video Volvo Ocean Race CARJAM TV", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T15:19:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWXTiSbE4zc", "description": "\u5fa1\u5dbd\u5c71 \u5927\u5674\u706b\uff01 Volcano Eruption in Japan!\n\nCentral Japan volcano Mt.

Windows Live Movie Maker is a free download from Microsoft and you can get it by going to http://get.live.com.\n\nVery often you may have a video that has a start and end that may feel very abrupt. You can make it look smoother by adding a fade-in effect for the beginning and fade-out effect for the end. It gives your video a somewhat more professional look and feel.\n\nIn order to apply multiple effects to the same clip, first select the Visual Effects tab in the Ribbon menu. Next, click on the more button in the list of visual effects and then select Multiple Effects from the drop down menu.\n\nIn the left column, under available effects, scroll down until you find the fade-in and fade-out options.  Select the fade in effect you like and click on the add button. Next, select the fade out effect and click the add button. The order that these effects are listed in the right column does not matter. But it might for other effects and you can move an effect up or down by using the move up and move down buttons.\n\nClick on the apply button to apply the effects. You can preview the effects by clicking on the play button. That's it. You are ready to publish or save your video to file. \n\nHere is a tip if you are interviewing someone or recording yourself speaking to the camera. Start and stop with a few extra seconds of stationary position, that is, without moving or saying anything. It will allow you to add nice fade-in and fade-out effects to your video without cutting of the video while you are still speaking.\n\nCreate your own screen capture using these free software.\n- http://camstudio.org\n- http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24601", "title": "Adding fade-in fade-out effects in Windows Live Movie Maker", "publishedDate": "2011-06-29T20:39:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWcwS0auzZU", "description": "This video shows Tablet Computer decor.

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is the smallest member in the rabbit family that includes rabbits and hares.  Pikas are plant generalists but habitat specialists in that they require cool microclimates to regulate their body temperature. Pikas are distributed throughout the western United States and are found mainly in moist subalpine and alpine habitats that are dominated by talus slopes.  They are extremely well adapted to montane environments, but are sensitive to climatic extremes and temperatures above 80oF can be lethal to pikas in as little as six to eight hours. To stay cool, pikas will stay in rock crevices or under large boulders until the ambient temperature cools. Pikas can also inhabit non-alpine environments at lower elevations that include lava fields and mining areas.  In these areas the temperatures tend to be much higher and pikas must adjust their foraging behaviors to cooler times of the day and utilize the cool microclimates for longer periods of time.\nPikas do not hibernate and remain active all winter long.

Why? Because every collagen cream I used, well I didn't see any result, that is until I used St. James Formula Type II Collagen\n\nI have a friend who has used every high end skin care line out there and when she told me about that she was getting fantastic results with a collagen product that a retired pharmacist had created,\nI immediately wanted some for myself....\n\nI love the results my 50 plus year old skin is hydrated, plumper, firmer and my fine lines are gone.  \n\nRemember as we age, we begin to produce less and less collagen which leads to fine lines, wrinkles and worst of all sagging skin.\n\nYou are never too young to get started on a good collagen cream.\n\nSo what makes St. James Formula Type II  Collagen cream work?\n\nMarine Collagen -- this is the highest quality of collagen available.  Most other products are using inferior collagen from chickens...why because it is cheaper..\n\nSt. James Formula takes the processing of Marine Collagen one step further than other brands, by reducing the molecular weight of the Type II Collagen Peptides to 1000 Dalton.  \n\nThis greatly enhances the absorption rate and instantly boosts the collagen level in the skin\n\nThere are no filler ingredients that dilute the powerful effects of the collagen.\n\nThere are no preservatives, no toxic ingredients of any kind.\n\nSt. James Formula Type II Collagen is pure product, you only need to use a small amount. \n\nI know it's hard to believe but just 2 pumps will cover your entire face and neck.\n\nSt. James Formula Type II Collagen is the purest, most powerful collagen product on the market.\n\nNot available in stores....you'll only find it on  The Ageless Beauty Report.com\n\nDid you like this video?

We must go to those who would never come into our churches \u2014 to the atheists, to the religious, to the self-righteous, to the God-hating and win their souls to Christ.\n\nThe Holy Scripture declares, \"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!\" (Romans 10:14-15)\n\nWe are commanded by the Lord Jesus Christ to teach all nations \u2014 including ours \u2014 to observe all things He has commanded. Jesus declared, \"...All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you...\" (Matthew 28:18-20)\n\nSin destroys lives, families, communities, and nations. The Bible explains, \"Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.\" (Proverbs 14:34) It is for this reason that we must combat the moral decay and darkness of our nation since we are the preservative and light. Jesus declared, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.\" (Matthew 5:13)\n\nFor so long, as followers of Christ, we have allowed Satan to invade our communities through abortuaries, the entertainment and pornography industries, religious institutions, sexually perverse establishments, homosexual parades and other sin celebrations without a word from the Christian therein. God has called us to \"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression...\" (Isaiah 58:1)\n\nWe must lift up our voice like a trumpet. We must go out into the world and declare the Word of God in front of the abortuaries and sexually perverse establishments, and at the homosexual parades and other sin celebrations, calling \"all men every where to repent.\" (Acts 17:30) Our light must invade the darkness!\n\nJesus said, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" If we love God, we will obey his commandments, and if we love our neighbours, we will go to them with the Word of God, so that they might be saved. \"[F]aith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" (Romans 10:17)\n\nWhether it be the public proclamation of the Gospel message (Romans 10:14-15), opening thy mouth for the voiceless (Proverbs 31:8-9), preaching to the poor and comforting the brokenhearted (Luke 4:18), warning the wicked of their way (Ezekiel 33:8-9), or working to preserve our liberties to do so, RA continues to \"fight the good fight of faith.\" (1 Timothy 6:12)\n\nServant of the Lord Jesus Christ,\nsong By Chris Blankinship", "title": "America Red White and Brused", "publishedDate": "2008-06-07T19:35:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AWx8VlnT8ZY", "description": "Blessed are the Cheese Makers!\n\n*** Use Homogenized Milk (that's Whole Milk for my US friends.)\n*** You can get rennet at major grocery stores or try bulk food stores.\n\nAfter watching and reading about cheese making, I decided to give it a try on my own.

(MVIS 2.14, +0.06, +2.88%) and its Project Tuatara collaborators Capcom and Intel Corporation are showing off infinite reality gaming, an entirely new gaming experience that helps eliminate the barrier of fixed screens. Project Tuatara enables high-definition projected displays on any surface imaginable--no monitor or TV screen required--and delivers immersive movement to the PC gaming experience far beyond what consoles offer today. The technology will be demonstrated using one of the highest-scaling games Intel has tested on the Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 Processor Extreme Edition this year--Capcom's \"Lost Planet 2\" for PCs, slated for release next week.\n\nAs a first step towards infinite reality gaming, Project Tuatara unlocks game play from the screen, enabling gamers to experience first-person shooter or third-person perspective video games all around them. The walls, ceiling and floor are now part of the action as gamers point the gun up to see the sky, and spin around to see what's behind them. Project Tuatara will be available to experience at the Intel Extreme Masters booth (#726) on the show floor, as well as at an invitation-only party the evening of October 9 hosted by Capcom, Intel and Microvision.\n\n\"While the major gaming platforms are focused on 3D and controller-free gaming, Microvision is leveraging the unique characteristics of its ultra-miniature PicoP display technology to show how game play can also break free from the screen,\" said Michael Fritts, vice president of sales, marketing and business development, Microvision. \"Infinite reality gaming is much more realistic and exciting as gamers are free to roam and physically experience fantastic environments as if they were in them.\"\n\nProject Tuatara Explores Gaming's Future\n\nThe Project Tuatara prototype gun is a battery operated, wireless HD video projection display and wireless controller, created to explore the market opportunity for Microvision's gaming platform enabled by the PicoP(R) display engine. The latest design is based on a bullpup rifle that is lighter and easier to operate, and includes more programmable buttons. Microvision's PicoP display engine, now embedded below the rifle's sights, uses lasers and a single scanning mirror to cast a large, vivid, high-definition image that is always in focus with none of the rainbow artifact effects of other ultra-miniature projection technologies.\n\nCombined with an Intel Core i7 Processor Extreme Edition-based PC and one of the most visually arresting games in the world--\"Lost Planet 2\" for the PC--gamers get an immersive and intense experience without compromising frame rates or system performance.\n\n\"Microvision and Intel are excited to demonstrate the next-generation of game play and show new levels of reality,\" said Jeff Abbate, director of marketing, Intel Software and Services Group. \"Microvision's Project Tuatara takes advantage of the power of a system based on the Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition to deliver a realistic and intense gaming experience, giving users 360-degrees of freedom, without added lag or delays.\"\n\n\"We've updated the massive enemies and epic settings of our console game to become one of the highest-performing PC games Intel has tested this year,\" said Christian Svensson, vice president of strategic planning & business development, Capcom. \"With innovations like Project Tuatara, the immersive game play of 'Lost Planet 2' becomes an even more compelling experience. It highlights a possible future for gaming that's more real, more intense and more engaging than ever before.\"\n\nCheck Out Project Tuatara Live at New York Comic Con\n\nExecutives from Capcom, Intel and Microvision will be discussing the future of PC gaming and introducing Project Tuatara at a joint press conference on October 9 at 4 p.m., at the Intel Extreme Masters booth. Attendees will also experience Project Tuatara's intense \"infinite reality\" while playing Capcom's \"Lost Planet 2\" running on PC's powered by Intel(R) Core(TM)i7 Extreme Edition processors.\n\nAbout Microvision\n\nMicrovision provides the PicoP display technology platform designed to enable next-generation display and imaging products for pico projectors, vehicle displays and wearable displays that interface with mobile devices. The company's projection display engine uses highly efficient laser light sources which can create vivid images with high contrast and brightness.

The aviator, of whom Yeats writes as in the first person, is convinced that the flight he is about to take will be his last, and he thinks of why he has chosen to fly. He flies for different reasons than most, not out of sense of duty or patriotism, nor for prestige or for those he has left behind. He reasons that he made his decision on the basis that his life so far has been wasted, and can see nothing to convince him that his life to come will be any better, and thus that it is better to enjoy the present, whatever the consequence. The airman in the poem is widely believed to be Major Robert Gregory, a friend of Yeats and the only child of Lady Augusta Gregory, Yeats' patron and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre. The collection The Wild Swans at Coole, in which this poem appeared also contained the poem \"In Memory of Major Robert Gregory\". In total, Yeats wrote four pieces based on Major Gregory's death. William Butler Yeats ( 13 June 1865 - 28 January 1939) was an Irish poet and dramatist and one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years Yeats served as an Irish Senator for two terms. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, and along with Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn founded the Abbey Theatre, and served as its chief during its early years. In 1923, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Literature for what the Nobel Committee described as \"inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation;\" and he was the first Irishman so honored.[1] Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers whose greatest works were completed after being awarded the Nobel Prize Kind Regards Jim Clark All rights are reserved on this video recording copyright Jim Clark 2009 An Irish Airman Foresees his Death.............

Small meat eaters may have been warm blooded. Plant eaters who were not as active were probably cold blooded. A warm-blooded animal needs about 10 times more food than a cold-blooded animal the same size.\n3,The heaviest dinosaur was Brachiosaurus at 80 tonnes. It was the equivalent to 17 African Elephants. Brachiosaurus was 16m tall and 26m long and is the largest dinosaur skeleton to be mounted in any museum.\n4,New study's have been revealed that a dinosaur fossil found in Africa pushes the dawn of the dinosaurs back to around 240 million years ago. This is 10 million years earlier than previously thought.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "ACC Players of the Week | ACC Now", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T17:17:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXAK9nVBI3M", "description": "Music video by Mary J.

It's not really clear if it occurred just prior to birth or immediately following birth, but it's definitely pneumonia and a lot of the conditions that we've been managing since then are all related to pneumonia,\" says Lamberski\n\nWhile the gorilla is in critical care, Lamberski and the team of veterinarians and neonatal specialists remain optimistic.\n\n\"The baby gorilla is in critical care, but we're optimistic that she will have a full recovery. In children, it usually takes about 7-10 days to recover from pneumonia, we're at day six today, and the gorilla is making progress,\" say Lamberski\n\nThe baby gorilla's mother, 18-year-old Imani, is doing well and expected to make a full recovery following the emergency C-section. She is back in her familiar habitat, eating and interacting with other members of her troop. This is the first baby for Imani and the 17th gorilla to be born at the Safari Park. The Safari Park is home to eight gorillas, including the new baby.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Baby Gorilla Born Last Week Has Pneumonia, Expected to Recover", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T06:58:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXHtmP1eIHk", "description": "http://www.facebook.com/LoopkingzInstrmntls\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Loopkingz", "title": "DramaTic - 0 [prod. by George Air Brush]", "publishedDate": "2011-11-28T15:31:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXHv0EU_K1w", "description": "Where to get Toxic Orb Flame Orb in Pokemon X and Y will show you where to get a Toxic Orb and a Flame Orb in Pokemon X and Y. \n\nYou'll need BP from the Battle Maison, so head to Kiloude City! \n\nNote: You can only get to Kiloude City after you've beat the game so make sure to take out the E4 first!  ...", "title": "Where to get Toxic Orb Flame Orb in Pokemon X and Y", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T23:49:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXI3ifVMWkI", "description": "..........", "title": "The Self Inflicted Woes of Unity Mitford", "publishedDate": "2008-09-22T22:23:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXILjvEJXTY", "description": "HD version", "title": "Ethyl n a Viper", "publishedDate": "2010-09-01T03:57:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXIWwwzI6HM", "description": "Substantive Unconscionability - Substantive Unconscionability relates to unfair contract terms that seem to be extremely one sided or harsh.

To help reverse this, Immunice releases hundreds of phytonutrients that act at the molecular level to enhance T cell activation, improve proliferation of Lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, and Thymocytes, increase antibody, Leucocyte, Cytokine, and red blood cell production, raise mast cell levels, and stimulate Phogocytosis and plasma fibrinolytic activity in your body.\n\n2) Exercising Regularly - Regular exercise elevates the level of leukocytes, an Immune System cell that fights infection.  Exercise also increases release of endorphins, natural hormones that heighten your sense of well being and improve sleep quality, both of which have positive effects on your Immune System.  Exertion stimulates the cardiovascular system, improves blood flow, circulates antibodies, flushes toxins from muscles and organs, removes germs, and helps keep the kidneys and endocrine system fully functional.\n\nModerate exercise must be repeated on a near-daily basis so that there is a cumulative effect that leads to a long-term immune response. Getting your heart rate up for just 20 minutes three times a week is associated with increased immune function, and a 30-minute brisk walk five days a week can help reduce your risk of catching a cold. Walking strengthens your cardiovascular system and blood flow. Walk ten minutes, three times a day if you are unable to walk 30 minutes at one time. You can also do both cardio and light weight training to make your body more resilient in fighting off and recovering from illness.\n\n3) Increasing Antioxidants Intake - Free radicals cause cell mutations, damage immune function, and contribute to severe diseases like cancer and heart blockage. They are produced by the body's own natural processes, toxins, radiation, and poor digestive function. Unlike a stable molecule in which every atom in your cell is ringed by pairs of electrons, free radicals carry an unmated electron that desperately wants to pair up with another. By snaring an electron from a neighboring molecule (which then makes that molecule a free radical), it can set off a chain reaction that leads to unrelentless cellular damage which wipes out cytokine pathways - disorienting immune system activities. The antidote for free radicals are antioxidants. When an antioxidant encounters a free radical, it freely gives up an electron of its own which satisfies the free radical and stops the out of control damage. This makes the antioxidant a free radical because it's now an electron short. However, the chain reaction is stopped as the newly created free radical made from the antioxidant is very weak and unlikely to do harm. Antioxidants also support body detoxification by boosting Glutathione levels. Glutathione turns on apoptosis - the process in which \"bad\" mutated cells self-destruct.  \n\nThere's a good supply of antioxidants in brightly colored fruits and vegetables, including berries, citrus fruits, kiwi, apples, red grapes, kale, onions, spinach, sweet potatoes, and carrots.  Other immune-boosting foods include fresh garlic (which has antiviral and antibacterial properties) and old-fashioned chicken soup.  Mushroom varieties such as reichi, maitake, and shiitake also have positive influence on immune function.\n\n4) Increasing Beta-Carotene Intake - Beta-Carotene and other Carotenoids stimulate immune cells that fight free radicals and fortify the thymus gland, protecting your body from harmful effects of stress.  It also protects you against cancer by stimulating macrophages cells to produce tumor necrosis factor (which kills cancer cells) and increasing the production of T-cell Lymphocytes and other natural killer cells that attack cancer cells.  Beta-Carotene also reduces the risks of cardiovascular diseases by preventing fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream from forming arterial plaques.  There is no RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) for Beta-Carotene but studies have concluded that at least 3 milligrams of it daily is necessary to reduce risk of chronic diseases.  Good sources of Beta-Carotene include apricots, asparagus, beets, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, corn, green peppers, kale, mangoes, turnip and collard greens, nectarines, peaches, pink grapefruit, pumpkin, squash, spinach, sweet potato, tangerines, tomatoes, and watermelon.", "title": "Immunice Testimonial by Osborne", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T07:45:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXXszJUmmik", "description": "Download the new album from Blake Shelton, BRINGING BACK THE SUNSHINE, including the new single \"Neon Light\": http://smarturl.it/bbts\n\nStream on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/neonlightspotify\nhttp://www.blakeshelton.com\nhttps://twitter.com/blakeshelton\nhttps://www.facebook.com/blakeshelton", "title": "Blake Shelton - Neon Light (Official Audio)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T18:31:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "AXYCYvonOpQ", "description": "Music by Kevin Macleod http://freemusicarchive.org/music/kevin_macleod/.

You see, the first enemy tries to whistle in the bishop's ears so as to block his hearing. The second stands in front of him in order to scratch out his eyes. The third enemy is at his feet, shouting loudly and holding a noose in order to ensnare his feet when he lifts them off the ground. The first are those people or those impulses that try to draw the bishop away from the right path, saying: 'Why do you take so much work on yourself and why are you making your way on so narrow a path? Go off instead to the verdant path where so many people are walking. What does it matter to you how this person or those people behave? Why do you bother to offend or censure those people who could honor and appreciate you? If they do not offend you and those close to you, what do you care how they live or whether they are offending God? If you yourself are a good man, why do you bother to be judging others? Better to exchange gifts and services! Make use of human friendships in order to win praise and a good reputation during your lifetime.'\n\nThe second enemy wants to blind you like the Philistines did Samson. This enemy is worldly beauty and possessions, sumptuous clothing, the various trappings of pomp, human privileges and favors. When such things are presented to you and please the eyes, reason is blinded, love for God's commandments grows lukewarm, sin is carried out freely and, once committed, is taken lightly. Therefore, when the bishop has a moderate supply of necessary goods, he should be content. For all too many people nowadays find it more pleasant to stand around with Samson at the millstone of desire rather than to love the church with a praiseworthy disposition for pastoral ministry.\n\nThe third enemy shouts loudly and carries a noose and says: 'Why are you walking with such caution and with your head bowed down? Why do you humble yourself so much, you who should be and could be honored by many people? Be a priest so as to sit among those of the first rank! Be a bishop so as to be honored by the many! Advance to higher ranks in order to obtain better service and enjoy greater relaxation!
