Formerly known as In A Hot Coma, the band changed their name to the Haskels after Jill Kossoris left to start her own band, The Shivvers. The Haskels helped pave the way for the burgeoning Milwaukee punk scene. \n\nBut after a while two key members, Guy Hoffman and Richard LaValliere, left the band to form the Oil Tasters. Bobby Mitchell and Vodie Rhinehart were then recruited but this line-up lasted only a short time longer. Original member Gerard LaValliere left to form the Dominoes. Undaunted, the Haskels persevered as a three-piece and released a tremendous EP. But shortly after its release the band split and Bobby joined Gerard in the Dominoes. \n\nThe only constant member, Jerome Brisch (Aka Presley Haskel), was killed in 1991. \n\nLearn more about the Haskels on the Cheap Rewards Record Blog:\n http://cheaprewards.blogspot.com/2011/09/haskels-taking-city-by-storm.html", "title": "The Haskels -  Daddy's Girl", "publishedDate": "2011-09-18T20:03:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wzMyAsP-Hs", "description": "Wasserziergefl\u00fcgelanlage, ornamental waterfowl", "title": "black necked swans at pond of ornamental waterfowl", "publishedDate": "2010-04-24T21:40:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wzZkacJQ40", "description": "C1 12 Neutralisation  (Audiobook)", "title": "C1 12 Neutralisation (Audiobook)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-05T12:39:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wzu2UgOX70", "description": "http://www.maineventpromo.com | One Love Caribbean Festival brought to you by maineventpromo.com has set the stage for a much larger festival scheduled for 2014 | The International Reggae Festival aiming at bringing the Orlando reggae culture onto the world map as one of the world popular hub for the Reggae Culture.\n\nThanks to Reggae Artist Natural Vibes for his performance at the One Love Carib Fest and the contribution of one of his tracks Wine Me Gyal.

The idea of autonomy when considering the 'sign' as suggested by Saussure interested me greatly.  I was concerned with the idea that when one rejects their sociol roles in a modern society, what happens to the postmodern idea of self?  Can this anti-postmodern sense of identity survive in a capitalist environment?  Nontheless, when rejecting this idea of postmodern identity, I felt one should reject all senses of social constructions, language become fallable and so does the concept of fashion.  When one rejects all these constructed ideas, I found that perhaps the human is always concerned with the libidal materialisations of the mind (a la Jung and Freud) and it becomes something quite celestial and all powerful when viewed pragmatically.  I showed this video in a solo show in my home town and was met with applause and very positive reviews in Frieze magazine.

GEN BRAR NOT AWARE OF GROUND REALITIES OF THE STATE SCENARIO- CM\nBADAL ASSAILS CONGRESS FOR BEING HABITUAL OF RAISING BOGEY OF MILITANCY WHEN OUT OF POWER\nREITERATES COMMITMENT OF THE SAD-BJP TO MAINTAIN PEACE, BROTHERHOOD AND COMMUNAL HARMONY AT ALL COSTS\nJalandhar, October 11-\n            Punjab Chief Minister Mr Parkash Singh Badal today announced that a mega education city over an area of 1500 acre would soon come up at Mullanpura near Chandigarh to give further impetus to the quality higher education in the state.\n            In his inaugural address on the third 'Bhartiya Vigyan Sammelan (BVS) and Expo-2012' to imbibe the scientific temper amongst our youth here at Lovely Professional University (LPU) in collaboration with Punjab Technical University and the Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST), the Chief Minister said that the upcoming education city would house eminent world class educational institutions and universities in humanities, medical, pharmaceutical, engineering etc. to impart the start of art education to the students of our country as well as from other parts of the world. Appreciating the initiative of LPU, PTU and PSCST to hold this four day mega conference, Mr Badal said that it would go a long way in inculcating scientific and technical fervor amongst our youth through interaction with not only scientists, technocrats, academicians, policy makers, research scholars and students from \"structured organizations,\" but also with innovative farmers, technicians and artisans, on the topics relevant to global community in general and to Indian science and technology in particular. He said the this conference was dedicated to eminent mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan who is part of a rich Indian heritage of mathematics with other luminaries like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara, Sankara who created and built upon the foundations of science as we know it today. \nThe Chief Minister lauded the stupendous efforts of the management of the LPU team led by Chancellor Mr Ashok Mittal in creating a huge infra structure at par excellence with any educational institute of international repute. He pointed out that this world class institute over an area of 600 acres was the outcome of sheer commitment and dedication to spread quality education to every nook and corner of the country.   \n      The Chief Minister assured that the state government would earnestly implement all the decisions for the betterment of higher education likely to be emerged on the basis of consensus from detailed deliberations in the BVS. Mr Badal said, \"I am confident that the valuable inputs and suggestions given by the delegates to the Punjab Government would be seriously viewed in the formulation and implementation of the future plans/programs for the provision of safe drinking water, cleaning of ponds besides the treatment of industrial effluents effectively for the irrigation purposes\".\nLater, during an informal interaction with the media persons, the Chief Minister said the former Lieutenant General Mr KS Brar was issuing statements without having adequate knowledge about the ground realities of the state. Mr Badal said that how a person living within the four walls of his house in a far flung state and above all who has not even visited Punjab since long could comment on the scenario of the state. Seeking support and co-operation from media, Mr Badal categorically urged the media to refrain from publishing/airing such sensational news content which could vitiate the peaceful atmosphere and jeopardize the hard earned peace in the state.\nAsked to comment on the apprehension expressed by Congress leadership on the possibility of revival of militancy in the state, the Chief Minister out-rightly rubbished these reports saying, Congress was habitual of racking up such issues out of frustration especially when they were out of power. He said Congress had always a destructive agenda to pursue while we have a constructive approach to ensure overall development of the state and welfare of its people. Blaming the Congress leadership for such irresponsible and inflammatory statements without having least concern for the state and its people, Mr Badal said that SAD-BJP alliance was committed to keep the social fabric of harmony, peace and brotherhood intact in the state and has successfully ensured peaceful atmosphere during its previous and as well as in present regime. To substantiate his claim the Chief Minister said even the clear mandate by the electorate during the last assembly elections in the favour of SAD-BJP reflected their unflinching trust and confidence reposed in our pro-people policies especially maintaining the communal harmony and peace on the top priority.", "title": "MEGA EDUCATION CITY TO COME AT MULLANPUR FOR GIVING A FILLIP TO HIGHER EDUCATION-BADAL", "publishedDate": "2012-10-11T13:39:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-x1B3_2puXI", "description": "2002\nQ Machine: Processor Card from Los Alamos National Laboratory's Hewlett-Packard Q Machine\n\n\u2022 8,192 microprocessors\n\u2022 2,000 computers in cluster\n\u2022 Able to vector-process\n\u2022 Capable of 3-D simulations comprising millions of atoms\n\n20 trillion floating point operations per second  \n20,000,000,000,000 floating point ops/sec\n20 teraflops", "title": "Q Machine: Processor Card", "publishedDate": "2012-02-02T18:23:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-x1bY5iIHRs", "description": "Caiman found in Catfish Pond in High Park in Toronto on Sunday July 6, 2014", "title": "Caiman in Toronto Pond", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T14:36:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-x1gaSkGg40", "description": "To further solidifying our Lifetime Warranty Against Sweat, the JayBird BlueBuds X feature Liquipel Sweat Repellant Nano Technology.

McLaren.\n\nSubscribe to the pamphlet program for $10 a month here: http://covenanter.org/pamphlets \n\nThis pamphlet is also available for purchase as an individual pamphlet.\n\n\nThe practice of Psalm singing, though not common today amongst Presbyterian churches, was the standard practice of Reformed churches from the time of the Reformation. In this small book, Donald C. McLaren presents the reader with a concise overview of the excellence of the Psalms and their inherent suitableness for praising God, under the New Testament.\nWriting at a time when Reformed churches, especially the Presbyterian churches, were increasingly seeking to accommodate themselves to the sensibilities of frontier revivalism, McLaren attempts to counter the slide into relativism in the worship of God. This work, originally published in 1840, was an irenic attempt to bring peace to the Presbyterian churches on this subject of psalmody. McLaren reasoned that if Presbyterians respected the Bible, and were mindful of their agreed upon subordinate standards, true and lasting peace would ensue amongst the brethren over this issue and brother would join voice with brother in proclaiming the praises of God. After all, the excellence of the Psalms of the Bible far exceeds that of any songs penned by fallible men.\nSubsequent to its publication, however, Donald saw two younger brothers, both Associate Reformed ministers, abandon exclusive psalmody for the broader Presbyterian Church, in the United States of America. This pattern of defection slowly destroyed the practice of Psalm singing in America. One of his brothers, John Finlay McLaren, went so far as to publish a small volume in opposition to singing the Psalms and defending the use of uninspired hymnody. In contrast, this small work stands as a monument to the wisdom of the older brother, Donald, who dared not to seek peace in the Presbyterian family at the expense of the eternal Word of God.", "title": "Exclusive Psalmody: The Only Songs of Zion | Covenanter Pamphlets", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T06:03:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-x4eSvUcT44", "description": "The memobottle fits in your bag alongside your laptop and books.

However, over time, what had started as a largely secular opposition movement began to take on more of a radical Islamist tone, with two al Qaeda offshoots -- the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra -- becoming the dominant forces on the ground across the rebel-held North.\n\nISIS's policy of kidnapping journalists has made it almost impossible to report from within Syria. But one VICE filmmaker managed to secure unprecedented access to both al-Qaeda factions battling Syria's government forces, creating this remarkable portrait of the foreign volunteers and local Syrians willing to fight and die to establish a new caliphate on Europe's doorstep.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nhttp://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/", "title": "Syria: Al-Qaeda's New Home (Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T20:37:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xIx6-gTQx4", "description": "This video is not mine!!!

We have some 2000 professionals and trades people at locations across Western Canada.\n\nOur Module Yards\nAs one of the largest module provider in Western Canada, we have more than 100 acres of land dedicated to fabrication and modularization.  We have the capability to produce 600 truckable modules annually.\n\nWorleyParsonsCord owns and operates three modularization yards and one fabrication shop in Alberta, Canada. At each of these yards, we build modules -- smaller, more manageable sections of massive fabricated structures. These are often structures used as oil refineries, gas plants, power stations, barges and a host of other mega-industrial purposes. \n\nThe fabrication shop produces smaller structural support items for the Modules being built at the Yards. \n\nThe Module Yard works like an assembly-line except each module remains set in one location while the different trades people complete their task and move on to the next module. The average size module weighs about 350,000 pounds and takes about 16 -- 24 weeks to build.\nMore than 1000 workers and 14 trade and professional groups work year round across all three Module Yards. \n\nFinished modules are loaded onto trucks and shipped to site locations as far away as Fort McMurray, Alberta. Once on site, the modules are offloaded unto piles by the trucks or by crane. Onsite, another WorleyParsonsCord crew gets to work fitting the modules together.\n\nFor information about WorleyParsonsCord visit our website:  http://www.worleyparsonscord.ca/", "title": "Russ - Manager, Fabrication & Module - WorleyParsonsCord", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T23:38:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xJVBFpEIsk", "description": "Sniffler und Ginny", "title": "Ratte und hase ratte beim bunkern", "publishedDate": "2010-03-13T22:22:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xJhYE4aALE", "description": "Quelques images du lago Majore en Italie", "title": "LMP VAGABONDAGE", "publishedDate": "2012-10-09T12:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xJlcDhzTMs", "description": "lao tzu complete works\nlao tzu full movie\nlao tzu full text\nlao tzu complete works pdf\nthe complete works of lao tzu", "title": "lao tzu full movie", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T15:08:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xJucjk8UoE", "description": "Stuart FL Lawyer Randall A.

Inuit is a collective noun; the singular is \"Inuk\". The Inuit language is grouped under the Eskimo-Aleut family.\nIn the United States, the term Eskimo is commonly used in reference to these groups, because it includes both of Alaska's Yupik and Inupiat peoples while \"Inuit\" is not proper or accepted as a term for the Inupiat. No collective term exists for both peoples other than \"Eskimo\". However, natives in Canada and Greenland view the name as pejorative and \"Inuit\" has become more common.\n\nThis video is on drawing Inuk from 2001 \"Inuk\" Cartoon Series.\nInuk is seven-year-old Inuit boy who lives with his family in the Arctic. Receiving a magical amulet he acquires the power to communicate with animals.

Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down. Like David O. Russell's previous films (The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook ), American Hustle defies genre, hinging on raw emotion, and life and death stakes.\n\nGenre: Crime / Drama  / Adventure\nCast: Alessandro Nivola, Louis C.K., Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale,\nDirector: David O.

Most bacteria are generally harmless, although some types have the potential to cause serious illness or death.\n\nTo kill harmful bacteria, milk is heated through a process called pasteurization. Pasteurization uses a combination of time and temperature to make milk safer. The higher the temperature, the shorter the amount of time the milk needs to be at that temperature. The milk we drink is generally heated to 161 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 15 seconds, and is then quickly cooled.  \n\nSome milk products are \"ultra pasteurized,\" which means the milk has been heated under pressure, for a shorter amount of time (2 seconds), at a higher temperature (280 degrees Fahrenheit). Ultra pasteurized milk has a longer shelf life -- up to 30 days before it is opened. Because ultra pasteurized milk is heated at a higher temperature, it can have a cooked milk taste.\n\nCommercially sterilized milk (called \"aseptic\") is cooked to an even higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. Commercially sterile milk can safely remain on the shelf for months, and does not need to be refrigerated until opened. Like ultra pasteurized milk, the higher temperature sterilization process may alter the taste of the milk.\n\nHomogenization\nMilk that comes directly from the cow separates into fat (cream) and liquid. To create a smooth, even consistency, milk is homogenized which is the process of removing some of the fat, and breaking down the remaining fat into smaller molecules that remain dispersed in the milk. Homogenization does not alter the nutritional value of milk.\n\nExpiration Dates and Refrigeration\nConsumers should adhere to the expiration date on milk packaging. And once the container is opened -- whether it is pasteurized, ultra pasteurized or commercially sterile-- milk should be refrigerated and used within seven days. Milk that is exposed to air and fluctuating temperatures exposes the milk to bacteria, which can grow. Refrigeration at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit and use within one week prevents bacteria exposure and milk spoilage.\n\nGrowth Hormone\nSome milk products have labels that state: \"We pledge not to treat our cows with the hormone rBGH,\" or \"Hormone free.\"  While hormones are neither added to nor present in milk, some farmers treat their cows with growth hormone to stimulate milk production. And while administering cows with growth hormone has nothing to do with milk safety, some consumers are uncomfortable with the practice and would prefer to purchase milk from cows that have not been treated with rBGH.\n\nRaw Milk \nMore recently, some consumers have taken an interest in unpasteurized or \"raw\" milk. Raw milk can come from cows, goats or sheep. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause food borne illness than pasteurized milk. In 2012, there were six pathogenic E. coli outbreaks related to raw milk. Young children, pregnant women, and anyone with a compromised immune system should not drink unpasteurized milk, or eat cheese or other food products made from unpasteurized milk because they are more likely to become ill, and are more likely to suffer dire consequences including death.\n\nWhen in Doubt, Throw it Out\nIf your milk ever doesn't look, smell or taste right, or if you have any question about the safety of your milk or any food product, it's best to get rid of it.  As always, when in doubt, throw it out.\n\nSource: Jennifer McEntire, PhD, IFT Spokesperson\nGo to IFT.org for more food science.", "title": "What are the different kinds of milk in a grocery store?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T18:43:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xyHZdpSeQg", "description": "Go overboard celebrating the non-accomplishment of a lifetime!", "title": "The Go Game - Ridiculous Victory Dance - Woo hoo", "publishedDate": "2011-08-12T13:43:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-xyM_HRpnNk", "description": "Although normally a very faint object,Comet Holmes became notable during its October 2007 return when it temporarily brightened by a factor of about half a million, in what was the largest known outburst by a comet, and became visible to the naked eye.

It signifies a big step change in marketing for the TAB, from a campaign specific to an always-on approach.\n\nThe creative challenge for Sugar&Partners was to develop a fresh, consistent brand vehicle that projects accessibility, fun and sociability.  Based around the simple truth that watching live racing and sport is much more entertaining with a bet on.\n\n\u201cPlace a bet and you\u2019re on a journey filled with tension, exhilaration and real excitement.  The campaign represents this feeling coming to life in a literal way; underpinned by Magic Carpet Ride, the rollercoaster creates an entertaining flexible brand device\u201d says Dave Nash, S&P creative director.\n\n\u201cAre you in? Is a natural progression for the brand and sums up what\u2019s on offer, inviting you to get involved\u201d adds Damon O\u2019Leary, S&P creative director.  \u201cIt builds on the competitive nature of backing the right team and the payoff between mates as well as the financial reward\u201d\n\nThe hero 45\u201d commercial featuring Steppenwolf\u2019s Magic Carpet Ride will feature in key placements, and will be cut-down for relevant and topical executions across league, tennis, netball and racing throughout the year.  For all other sport a retail layer has been developed that sees the viewer take the reins of the Rollercoaster \n\n\u201cThis approach is a really exciting move for us, not only having a unified brand vehicle to use across campaigns, we are now also able to be topical and relevant to our audience across every media touch point.   The retail television & digital layer will be a great marketing tool that we will be refreshing multiple times per month\u201d says Katherine O\u2019Connor, Campaign Manager, TAB.\n\n\u201cFrom the strong media planning and negotiating to the great execution of the single-minded idea this campaign is the culmination of months and months of hard work and true collaboration throughout our business and all our agency partners.  We\u2019re really looking forward to hearing back from our customers and seeing what chatter this generates.\u201d Adds Mike Heath, Head of Marketing and Digital Sales TAB.", "title": "TAB  - Are you in?", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T22:55:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yGUYvZ4sAA", "description": "ars: Otto Dix ''Selfportrait as Mars''\nbacking track (pozadina): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0DFOHmJnhQ", "title": "Gilmour style solo/Jura/(26.VII.2013./19:45)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T17:54:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yHLzjUdlWQ", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK:http://goo.gl/dHs73.\nThe Best of Bill Murray - Ultimate Movie Mashup HD\n\nA mashup dedicated to the legendary king of comedy, Mr. Bill Murray.\n\nWatch clips from his movies:\n\nLost in Translation - http://goo.gl/pYaDLB\nGet Low - http://goo.gl/YpKcrw\nGhostbusters - http://goo.gl/DKfAIo\nGhost Busters 2 - http://goo.gl/a3sxf3\nGroundhog Day - http://goo.gl/zno7Sh\nHyde Park on Hudson - http://goo.gl/X4EPaQ\nMeatballs - http://goo.gl/imCReH\nMoonrise Kingdom - http://goo.gl/g9xdkm\nScrooged - http://goo.gl/1jMU4o\nSt. Vincent - http://goo.gl/p1c7bn\nStripes - http://goo.gl/ULKMUo\n\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

This is used in a popular children's nursery rhyme.\nHiggledy Piggledy, \nMy black hen, \nShe lays eggs \nFor gentlemen; \nSometimes nine, \nAnd sometimes ten, \nHiggledy Piggledy, \nMy black hen!\nNow, I've chosen a selection of these reduplicated compounds or ricochet words, as they're known. I'm going to give you them in this Daily Dose of English and I'm going to give a definition of each on the right hand side, here. So here goes.\n\nchit-chat - Talk socially without exchanging too much information.\nWe exchanged some chit-chat about the weather.\n\nmish-mash - A confused mixture.\nThe play was a mish-mash of clich\u00e9s and platitudes.\n\nshilly-shally  - To be indecisive.\nNo shilly shally about this girl. She gets things done.\n\ntittle-tattle  - Empty talk about trivial matters, especially gossip.\nBecause what came back to us was very much tittle-tattle gossip that people picked up in Paris.\n\ntick-tock  -  An imitation of the ticking of a clock.\nHickory, dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock, the clock struck one, the mouse ran down, hickory, dickery, dock, tick-tock.\n\npitter-patter  - Rapid repetition of words. An imitation of the sound made by light rain or footsteps.\nWe were woken at the crack of dawn by the pitter-patter of seagulls as they pecked for their breakfast.\n\nwilly-nilly - In a random manner. Without having any choice in a matter.\n'Mean bitch,' thought Melanie who was, willy-nilly, developing some shop-keeper attitudes.\n\nargy-bargy  - A verbal dispute or wrangling (angry or disruptive) argument.\nI don't want to get into any argy-bargy about anything particularly.\n\nhoity-toity  - Assumption of superiority, putting on airs, or being snooty. Also giddy behaviour.\nBut of course to Miss Hoity-Toity Grenfell, it was nothing less than she expected.\n\nlovey-dovey  - Outwardly or overly affectionate.\nNot into the sappy, lovey-dovey stuff surrounding Valentine's Day?\n\nhanky-panky  - A misrepresentation through words intended to take advantage of another. Trickery.\n...which the Tories also won by a tiny majority (593), there are yet more allegations of electoral hanky-panky.\n\nhelter-skelter -  Disorderly haste or headlong confusion. Haphazardly.\nThere were bits of computers piled up helter-skelter.\n\nhodge-podge  - A confused mix of ingredients or ideas.\nRoots, wood, bark, and leaves clapt hodge-podge together, they don't make a tree.\n\nnamby-pamby  -  Weak, insipid and foolishly sentimental in a childish way.\nHe had just that small namby-pamby air which would suit Pauline's faint-hearted lover.\n\nnitty-gritty  - The realities or basic facts of a problem or situation. The heart of the matter.\nHe's not afraid to get down to the nitty-gritty of unpleasant problems.\n\npell-mell - Disorderly, confused mingling and reckless confusion.\nThe dead and the dying were huddled pell-mell together.\n\nteeny-weenie - Very small.\nToday in Paris we had teeny-weenie nappies knotted loosely on the loins.\n\nI hope you enjoyed these ricochet words as much as we English enjoy them and I'll see you tomorrow for another Daily Dose of English.\n\nLearn English online using Skype: I also give online English classes by Skype.

Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the Internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live full length MLB game over the Internet when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time.

MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.

More on this topic, visit: http://www.drchristinahibbert.com/self-esteem-self-worth/\n\nself esteem\nself worth\nhow to feel self worth\n3 minute therapy\n\n1)   Most of us are seeking self-esteem and self-worth whether we recognize it or not.  As I wrote in another article, \"self-esteem\" is \"a hot topic; a Google search will return 76, 200,000 results! There is plenty of advice out there on how to 'understand' self-esteem, 'evaluate' self-esteem, and 'improve' self-esteem, on teaching self-esteem to kids, teens, women, couples, grandparents! (OK, I didn't see any on grandparents, but I'm sure it's out there somewhere). As one major psychology site said, 'Perhaps no other self-help topic has spawned so much advice and so many (often conflicting) theories.'[i] And I agree.\"[ii] As I said before, I see it all the time--with my clients, friends, family members. It seems we're almost all searching for that true sense of who we are, that confidence that we are enough.\n \n\n2)   Most of us don't know what \"self-esteem\" really even means. It's hard to define and even harder to \"have.\" I've come across many definitions of self-esteem, but the one I think fits best comes from my favorite book on self-esteem, Nathaniel Branden's \"Six Pillars of Self-Esteem.\" He defines self-esteem as: \"the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life. More specifically, self-esteem is: 1. Confidence in our ability to think...[and] cope with the basic challenges of life, and 2. Confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being worth, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts.\"[iii] How's that for a definition?\n\n \n3)   Self-esteem plays a role in all of our lives, whether we understand it or not. We may not fully understand what self-esteem means, but that doesn't seem to matter. It still impacts almost all of our lives in pretty incredible ways. As Branden writes, \"The level of our self-esteem has profound consequences for every aspect of our existence: how we operate in the workplace, how we deal with people, how high we are likely to rise, how much we are likely to achieve\u2014and in the personal realm, with whom we are likely to fall in love, how we interact with our spouse, children, and friends, what level of personal happiness we attain.\"[iii]\n\nwhat does self esteem mean\nself confidence\nlow self confidence\nhigh self confidence\n\nCheck out Dr Hibbert's Book on Amazon:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/This-How-Grow-Psychologists-Discovering-ebook/dp/B00GM6PAYM\n\nAmazon Author Page: http://www.amazon.com/Christina-Hibbert/e/B00GNODXLK/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drchibbert\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DrCHibbert\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+ChristinaHibbert", "title": "Beyond \"Self Esteem\"-How to Feel Self Worth: 3-Minute Therapy w/Dr. Christina Hibbert", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T04:51:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yX5YlVCpt4", "description": "", "title": "Official Anti-Minute Teaser Trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-03-26T00:30:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yXYXOkwIo0", "description": "Coastal AHEC recently entered into an agreement with Davis Health Care to supply a Geriatrician physician to practice on site at Davis Health Care.

But not only has Jessie been cheating on him with a younger minister, Horace (Todd Allen), she has pulled a few strings to gain control of his church. Sonny goes into a violent rage, attacking Horace with a bat during a softball game. With Horace in a coma, Sonny leaves town on a bus, headed east for a new life. He changes his name to E.F., baptizing himself as \"The Apostle\" to God. Arriving in the black community of Bayou Boutte, Louisiana, he meets Brother Blackwell (John Beasley) who helps him start anew. E.F. works as a garage mechanic and preaches on the streets and a local radio station owned by Elmo (Rich Dial). He leads the community in remodeling a rundown church and gains supporters as he seeks his own salvation. In sorrow from the deaths of both his mother (June Carter Cash) and Horace, he encounters more problems when a racist (Billy Bob Thornton) attempts to drive a bulldozer into his church. Eventually, Jessie finds out where he's living and informs the police. Duvall wrote, directed, and financed this exploration of the evangelical world, shown at the Toronto Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. Filmed in Texas (Denton County, Collin County, and Dallas) and Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\n\"the apostle\",\"the apostle clip\",\"the apostle robert duvall\",\"the apostle paul\",\"john beasley\",\"walton goggins\",\"rick dial\",\"basket videos\",\"box videos\",\"door videos\",\"food videos\",\"microphone videos\",\"piano videos\",\"independent dramas\",drama,\"rob carliner\",\"steven brown\",\"robert duvall\",\"ed johnston\",\"family videos\",\"generosity videos\",\"good videos\",\"helping videos\",\"leadership videos\",\"love videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++158676,/m/0cy5pt,/m/0bqsdt5,/m/015c4g,/m/07qyl3", "title": "The Apostle (7/10) Movie CLIP - On My Way to Heaven (1997) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-28T07:33:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yZeH08vNkM", "description": "A hurricane came in to land whilst packing up an event at North Weald, Essex.\nGlad i had the camera ready.", "title": "Hurricane fly-by and landing North Weald", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T20:30:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yZipqTDjds", "description": "Aestiva Notify and Hold automates the Late Approval Reminder process.", "title": "Aestiva Notify and Hold", "publishedDate": "2012-08-17T17:56:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-yZkpxYp71M", "description": "Buy this puzzle here: http://bit.ly/13gX7Jk\n\nSubscribe: http://youtube.com/subscribe_widget?p=chareaves\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thetwistypuzzler\nBlogger: http://twistypuzzling.blogspot.com\n\nPlease click LIKE as it's a huge encouragement to me to keep making these videos.

That means it's not a real thirsty plant.\n\nHardenbergia\nThis blooming purple vine is called Hardenbergia or \"Happy Wanderer\".  It is a plant that absolutely hates wet soil and it will just give up if it stays too wet.  It loves a really, really hot spot, We call it the \"Royal Cloak of Winter\", It has this beautiful, beautiful color.  Now it is this kind of February time frame that it blooms.\n\nLeucodendron\nLeucodendrons we've talked about in the last few months they have these beautiful little tiny flowers that are surrounded by these colored bracts that give it the appearance of a flower. It is another Australian plant that is very water wise.\n\nCeanonthus\nDown hear we have a heavily budded, its getting ready to bloom, it's a Ceanothus. It has beautiful cobalt blue flowers that absolutely cover its little evergreen stems in spring. It is really amazing. This particular variety is called \"Dark Star\".  It will get 4-5' high, and wider than that. And again, hot, hot sun lover.\n\nCarpenteria\nThis is another California native, its called bush anemone or Carpenteria. And it produces beautiful white flowers with a yellow center in the spring.\n\nSalvias\nDown hear this represents all the Salvias, Salvias are extremely water-wise and wonderful blooming plants.  This is Winifred Gilman. \n\nWall Flowers\nAnd we have some Erisimums here that are very hardy, they love cold and dry. In 1990, we had some of these and they bloomed right through that 12 degree weather if you Can believe that, and again, they are not a real thirsty plant.\n\nNandinas\nNandinas, wonderful, solid state, tough, low water use plant.\n\nGrevillea\nThis darling little Grevillea, this one is called Crystal Gem, hummingbirds love this.  \n\nBuckwheat\nThis is called Buckwheat this is a California native over here.\nManzanita\nAnd this is a California native ground cover, Manzanita, as is this one, but it has a very different character.\n\nToyon\nThis is a Toyon, which is a very large shrub, or small tree with beautiful red berries at Christmas time.\n\nKangaroo Paws\nAnd, as you will remember, we talked a lot about this in another program, Kangaroo Paws, another great plant for low water use gardens.", "title": "Water Wise Plants", "publishedDate": "2014-02-03T07:17:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ydQ-qPD324", "description": "Buy here: http://exitrecordsuk.bandcamp.com/track/marka-ft-strategy\n\nwww.exitrecords.co.uk\nwww.dubphizix.com\nwww.facebook.com/skepticaluk1\nwww.twitter.com/skepticaluk\nwww.facebook.com/dubphizix\nwww.twitter.com/dubphizix\nwww.twitter.com/brokenenglish1\n\nVideo Directed and produced by Tom Doran\n\nFire performers: Cirque du Manc .....www.cirquedumanc.com  twitter: @cirquedumanc\n\nThanks to Emma, Skittles, Merny, Fro and Becks", "title": "Dub Phizix and Skeptical feat Strategy - Marka - Exit Records", "publishedDate": "2011-12-06T13:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ydeNMmatCg", "description": "Here is a mouth watering stir fry cooking ( authentic Chinese style ) with beef tendon, pre-cooked to a gelatin contingency.

Read the below article with embedded links on Obama Files website: http://web.me.com/kzvideo/OF/Obama_Files_Home.html\n\nApril 3, Liberal website Mediaite, alerted by Obama propaganda front Media Matters, was hopping mad at Fox News for permitting news anchor Heather Childers to tweet a link to a Godfather Politics article questioning Obama's birth certificate. Mediaite contacted Fox News, to which Fox News VP Michael Clemente dutifully took Childers behind the news shed to let her know birther talk was not allowed, and Clemente offered an abject apology to Mediaite. The Godfather Politics article cites a WND video interview and accompanying article conducted with Hollywood producer Bettina Viviano, where she alleges that while she was producing a documentary about Obama campaign delegate fraud in 2008, she heard Bill and Hillary Clinton question Obama's eligibility, and that Bill Clinton had planned on making a statement that Obama was not eligible to be President. The groundbreaking allegation, however\u2014and what mainly got Heather Childers in trouble for tweeting\u2014is that Viviano alleged Bill Clinton was told that if he went public with this statement, with the murder of Clinton's friend Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Bill Gwatney as a warning, his daughter Chelsea would be murdered if he mentioned the Obama eligibility issue.\n\nThe Chelsea Clinton threat of murder story currently seems to be dead in the MSM, but as of the posting of this video, it is literally seething on the Internet, and, as usual, the liberal media in trying to quash the story, has rather thrown gasoline on the flames.\n\nGodfather article: http://godfatherpolitics.com/4506/obama-campaign-threaten-life-of-chelsea-clinton-to-keep-parents-silent-on-obamas-ineligibility/\n\nMediaite article: http://www.mediaite.com/online/foxs-heather-childers-tweets-article-asking-if-obama-campaign-threatened-to-kill-chelsea-clinton-fox-responds/\n\nMedia Matters article: http://mediamatters.org/blog/201204030011\n\nWND article/video: http://www.wnd.com/2012/04/hollywood-producer-heard-bill-clinton-say-obama-ineligible/\n\nViviano Obama delegate fraud documentary 'We Will Not be Silenced' Parts 1&2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGZFgMNM-UU\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXNqFQmGxDU\n\nArticle and links by Obama Files staff", "title": "Insider-Clinton Told to Keep Mouth Shut About Obama Birth Cert or Chelsea Would be Murdered", "publishedDate": "2012-04-04T22:51:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHMpUIrjs0", "description": "A short bit.", "title": "Digging Holes and Building Things: Day_38", "publishedDate": "2011-09-05T04:07:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zH_Z0zoByI", "description": "HO Model Trains PRR E44 4404 Hauling Mixed Freight under Catenary.", "title": "HO Model Railroad PRR E44 4404 Hauling Mixed Freight under Catenary", "publishedDate": "2013-06-15T22:59:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHffSaF49k", "description": "Fantasma  en  grabado en  una  morgue  en  colombia  por una  persona  con su  telefono celular.\n\nWhile ghost hunting in an abandoned Colombian morgue, guy captures a ghost walking around in and out of the shadows.", "title": "Fantasma en una morgue en colombia-Colombian Morgue Ghost", "publishedDate": "2011-08-28T23:21:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHjgcCHo6I", "description": "Subscribe to BBC News HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\nActor and director, and star of the IT Crowd, Richard Ayoade talks about playing geeks, and middle-aged people on Tinder.\nCheck out our website: http://www.bbc.com/news \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/bbcworldnews \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/bbcworld\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/bbcnews", "title": "\u2018It would be sociopathic to regularly do interviews\u2019 says Richard Ayoade", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T12:17:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHv6uSVqTA", "description": "Watch the official music video by Capitol for their hit single \"Fourth Degree\"\n\nFor more information on Capitol, check them out on Facebook!\n\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/CapitolAZ\n\nSubscribe and check back soon for more videos and interviews with Capitol\n\n--\n\nBryanStars is a music blogger dedicated to bringing you exclusive interviews and behind the scenes video with your favorite bands and artists\n\nFor more of my videos, including interviews, music news, song premieres and more, please subscribe to my YouTube Channel and check out my official website\n\nhttp://www.BryanStars.com\n\nFollow me on Instagram\n\nhttp://www.Instagram.com/BryanStars\n\nFollow me on Twitter \n\nhttp://www.Twitter.com/BryanStars \n\nLike me on Facebook\n\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/BryanStars\n\nThumbs Up, Comment and Subscribe!!", "title": "Capitol - \"Fourth Degree\" Official Music Video", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T01:16:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHw6Q761tA", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Zolinza.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Zolinza", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T18:07:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zHwJpcFv_c", "description": "Immodesty Blaize superstar showgirl!

Der dicke, aufrecht stehende und, bis zu 12 cm hohe Stamm einer Phalaenopsis bildet breite, fleischige, wechselst\u00e4ndig wachsende Bl\u00e4tter, die bei den meisten  Phalaenopsis nach unten geneigt sind.\n\nDie Orchideen der Gattung Phalaenopsis bilden am Stamm zwischen den unteren Bl\u00e4ttern Luftwurzeln aus. \u00c4hnliche Wurzeln breiten sich auch \u00fcber das Substrat aus. Den Blattachseln der Orchideen entspringen bis zu 100 cm lange, elegant gebogene Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte. An den locker-traubigen oder rispenartigen Sch\u00e4ften der Phalaenopsis bilden sich bis zu 30 schmetterlings\u00e4hnliche Bl\u00fcten in einem Bl\u00fctenstand.\n\nDie Bl\u00fcten einer Phalaenopsis k\u00f6nnen zu jeder Jahreszeit erscheinen und halten sich bis zu drei Wochen. Neben den folgenden Phalaenopsis Arten gibt es zahlreiche Hybriden dieser h\u00fcbschen Orchideen mit eleganten Bl\u00fcten, die unter der botanischen Bezeichnung Phalaenopsis-Hybriden zusammenfasst sind.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Phalaenopsis\nLicht / Standort\n\nMan stellt die Phalaenopsis Orchideen w\u00e4hrend des ganzen Jahres hindurch an einen m\u00f6glichst hellen, aber nicht vollsonnigen Platz. In den kurzen, lichtarmen Wintertagen sollte man die Phalaenopsis Orchideen durch eine zus\u00e4tzliche k\u00fcnstliche Beleuchtung zur Bildung von Bl\u00fctenknospen anregen.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nMan gie\u00dft diese Orchideen m\u00e4\u00dfig und l\u00e4sst die oberste Schicht des Substrates zwischen dem W\u00e4ssern abtrocknen. Am besten wird eine Phalaenopsis am fr\u00fchen Morgen gegossen, denn diese Orchideen werden leicht von F\u00e4ulnis und Pilzkrankheiten befallen. Phalaenopsis bekommt schwarze Flecken, wenn nachts Wassertropfen auf den Bl\u00e4ttern bleiben.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Temperatur darf der Kultivierung einer Phalaenopsis nicht unter 20 \u00b0C fallen. Auch die Luftfeuchtigkeit muss f\u00fcr dies Orchideen hoch sein. Die Phalaenopsis legt keine Ruheperiode ein und w\u00e4chst das ganze Jahr \u00fcber.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nDies Orchideen der Gattung Phalaenopsis neigen dazu, an der Basis der Pflanze oder den Verzweigungen abgebl\u00fchter Sch\u00e4fte, Seitensprosse auszubilden. Wenn die Wurzeln etwa 3 bis 4 cm lang sind, kann man die Sprosse vorsichtig abschneiden und einzeln in kleine Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe mit dem f\u00fcr die Phalaenopsis empfohlenen Substrat setzen.\n\nDie Spr\u00f6sslinge stellt man an einen warmen, hellen,  nicht sonnigen Platz: In den kommenden 5 bis 6 Wochen werden die frisch eingesetzten Phalaenopsis nur sparsam gegossen. Ab der siebten Woche behandelt man sie wie ausgewachsene Phalaenopsis Orchideen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nAls Substrat f\u00fcr eine Phalaenopsis verwendet man Osmunda-Fasern, Baumrinde oder eine grobe Erde auf Torfbasis. Zur Verbesserung des Wasserabzugs gibt man zun\u00e4chst eine etwa 4 cm hohe Schicht Tonscherben in das Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df. Die Orchideen der Gattung Phalaenopsis gedeihen sehr gut in Holz- oder Drahtk\u00f6rben, die man mit Sphagnum auslegt.\nUmtopfen\n\nEtwa alle zwei Jahre topft man eine Phalaenopsis au\u00dferhalb der Bl\u00fctezeit um. Man pflanzt die Orchideen in etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfere Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe oder in nur frisches Substrat in dasselbe Gef\u00e4\u00df, falls die maximale Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Phalaenopsis bereits erreicht ist.\n\nDie alte Erde wird aus den Wurzeln gesch\u00fcttelt, und s\u00e4mtliche abgestorbenen Wurzeln der Orchidee werden abgeschnitten. Nach dem Umtopfen stellt man die Phalaenopsis  3 bis 4 Wochen lang an einen schattigen Platz.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Hauptwachstumszeit bekommt die Phalaenopsis regelm\u00e4\u00dfig einen handels\u00fcblichen Orchideend\u00fcnger in schwacher Konzentration.\nHinweise zur Pflanze\n\nUm die Bl\u00fctezeit der Phalaenopsis Orchideen zu verl\u00e4ngern, schneidet man die Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte bis knapp unter die Stelle zur\u00fcck, an der sich die erste Bl\u00fcte entwickelt hat. Neue Bl\u00fcten treten dann an Seitenzweigen auf, die sich an diesen Stellen ausbilden.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\nSchildl\u00e4use\n\nSchildl\u00e4use erkennt man bei genauem Hinsehen leicht an den hoch gew\u00f6lbten, festen R\u00fcckenschildern. Da die Schildl\u00e4use aufgrund ihrer F\u00e4rbung jedoch gut getarnt sind, werden sie schnell \u00fcbersehen. Man sollte seine Pflanzen deshalb regelm\u00e4\u00dfig und sorgf\u00e4ltig untersuchen. Spinnmilben\n\nTrockene, warme Heizungsluft bietet im Winter ein ideales Klima f\u00fcr Spinnmilben. Die Spinnweben sind besonders gut an den Blattachseln und gebuchteten Blattr\u00e4ndern zu erkennen. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfiges Einspr\u00fchen der Orchideen beugt dem Befall mit Spinnl\u00e4usen vor..", "title": "Phalaenopsis, Orchideen", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T22:43:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zOFWbnOc68", "description": "SUPERBRONTUS is so ripped and defined.

This I find surprising and interesting - that evolution doesn't come to the best solution, it comes to the most stable one.\n\nThe Forest of Friendship was a concept I first came across in Richard Dawkin's book \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" One point I'd like to clarify is that being taller comes with a cost - having a longer trunk requires costly expenditure of energy. However, in a forest of uniformly short trees, being a little taller conveys an advantage. That is until all the other trees catch up, at which time the extra height no longer provides a benefit. So over time as the whole forest rises up the conditions are getting worse for each tree, but they are powerless to stop the evolutionary arms race.\n\nHuge thank you to Brady Haran for filming (and summarizing the main points at the end of the film).

We created this test to show you that often container lashing points in containers can hold more cargo weight than is suspected or calculated. The video shows how the railcar loaded with cargo is shunted on an actual rail road against a static railcar. The cargo inside the container is secured with Cordlash polyester lashing and evenly distributed over 8 container lashing points inside the container. G-Force indicators were placed inside the railcar. These indicators measure G-forces upon impact in each direction. When the container was shunted it resulted in an impact force of up to 12G!!!

It was issued throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was well-received by troopers and officers alike for several key reasons.\nIt offered a slightly curved blade with a pipe back and strong point that was ground thin enough at the edge to cut well in the m\u00eal\u00e9e while remaining stiff and strong enough to thrust with in the charge. \nAlso, it had a low profile and an asymmetrically shaped, body-hugging guard, whose shell was pierced by 27 holes which reduced weight and improved balance. It's uniquely shaped half basket guard gave excellent protection to the thumb, fingers, wrist and forearm without the awkward \"bulk\" associated with other saber guards of the day.\nAfter years of fencing with 1904 Saber, Cold Steel president and Master at Arms, Lynn C. Thompson, decided to produce a replica based on an original from the private collection of Professor Anthony De Longis. Our interpretation of the 1904 Austrian Saber incorporates the same high carbon steel, pipe black blade, and half-basket guard as the original. It comes combat sharp, complete with an exact copy of the original's steel scabbard.

A well drafted employee handbook can be used as evidence of the standard policies governing conduct within the company on many key issues such as length of employment, anti-harassment policies, compensation and benefits.  Depending upon the circumstances, the contents of an employee handbook can be presented in court as either proof of terms of the employment agreement or as evidence of a disciplinary or anti-harassment policy.  It can also set the \u00b3rules of the game\u00b2 and clarify the expectations of the employer and the employee in major areas such as breaks and benefits.  An employee handbook should be carefully worded by an expert in order to avoid inadvertent legal liability.\n\nA useful perspective of legal thinking on the issue was stated by the California Supreme Court in the 2000 case of Guz v Bechtel, where the Court noted that:\n\n\"When an employer promulgates formal personnel policies and procedures in handbooks, manuals, and memoranda disseminated to employees, a strong inference may arise that the employer intended workers to rely on these policies as terms and conditions of their employment, and that employees did reasonably so rely.  \u0160 Both parties derive benefits from such an arrangement. From the employees\u00b9 perspective, formal policies promote fairness and consistency, guarding against the arbitrary, capricious, and incongruous treatment of similar cases. By the same token, such policies may also help the employer by enhancing worker morale, loyalty, and productivity, providing competitive advantage in the labor market, and minimizing employee litigation.\"\n\nThis case thus signaled that employee handbooks will be treated in a contract-like manner as part of the employee agreement.\n\nDon't forget to like, share, and comment on this video! http://youtu.be/-zaLv_9k0-U\n\nGet social with us!\nhttps://plus.google.com/103846747945516728924/about\nhttps://www.facebook.com/californialaw\nhttps://twitter.com/WBLawGroup1\nhttp://wblawgroup.blogspot.com/\n\nTags - employment attorney san diego, san diego employment attorney, employment law, employment laws", "title": "Employment Attorney San Diego", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T20:14:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-za_kkoQXn4", "description": "this is my version of the Alice of human sacrifice video, the pokemon in this video are all my oc's. from an ask blog of mine\n\nthe link to the blog: http://ask-blade-the-riolu-anything.tumblr.com/\n\nthe song is: [English Dub] Alice Human Sacrifice -Mecha Miku MIx-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o62vgPoxRyY\n\ntell me what you think in the comments below.", "title": "alice of pokemon sacrifice(my version)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T19:01:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zafJKbMPA8", "description": "This rap was created for a 6th grade science classroom to teach about the different parts of a cell.

Enjoy Joel's demo of this killer pedal.\n\nThe Electro-Harmonix Superego Synth Engine effects pedal is a new and unique product that combines elements of sampling, synthesis and infinite sustain. The Superego allows you to freeze sound, gliss between frozen tones, layer sounds and place an external effects loop on only the effect. In addition, the Superego can detect new notes or chords and sustain them automatically without requiring you to step on the footswitch. It even lets you tweak attack and decay, or use its effects loop to invent novel synth patches.\n\nThe Superego has three modes: Latch, Momentary and Auto. A toggle switch at the center of the Superego chooses between the three. Momentary mode is not labeled in the artwork; it is the center (or eye) position of the 3-position toggle switch.\n\nInstruments played:\n\n1959 Gibson ES-330T\n\nTone King Falcon 12W 1x10 Combo (http://goo.gl/uWI9R)", "title": "Electro-Harmonix Superego Synth Engine Pedal", "publishedDate": "2012-08-09T21:14:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zkMDEo4ahM", "description": "Francisco Basantes, estudiante de secundaria del colegio Los Alpes muestra el robot Alfa Rex en el CPQUITO 2011", "title": "Francisco Basantes muestra el robot Alfa Rex en el CPQUITO 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-10-20T23:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-zkgyJGzsQ4", "description": "My nephew teste 'Belimbing Buluh' at Besut Terengganu, Malaysia\nAverrhoa bilimbi is a fruit-bearing tree of the genus Averrhoa, family Oxalidaceae.

I want to show you that although the Son is subordinate to the Father, the Holy Spirit is not a third Person, in the sense of their being a Trinity. The Spirit is the essence of the Father, and now of the Son.\n\nConsider the verses which tell of the existence of \"the Spirit of the Father\" (Matt 10:20), \"the Spirit of the Son\" (Gal. 4:6), \"the Spirit of God\" (Romans 8:14), \"the Spirit of YHWH\" (Luke 4:18).\n\nThere's also \"the Spirit of Truth\"(John 16:13) \"the Spirit of adoption\"(Romans 8:15) and \"the Spirit of love, and of power and of sound mind\" (2 Tim. 1:7).There's a lot of Spirits out there or so it would appear. I am telling you that there is one Spirit. I am also telling you that this is what God is. God is the source of all spirit. We are now very familiar with the verse, \"God is Spirit ... The Father is seeking people to worship Him in spirit and truth\". (John 4:24)\n\nI posit that God is the Father and provider of every perfect gift (James 1:17) who works all in all. (John 5:30; Matt 10:20) He worked through Jesus, raised him from the dead (Romans 1:4) and works in us today.\n\nPaul explains: \n\n\"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all.\" (1 Cor 12:4)\n\n\"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism;one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.\" (Ephesians 4:4-6)\n\nUnderstand that this argument doesn't deny the personality of the Holy Spirit, it'd be too much to say the Spirit lackss personhood as it is God and Christ, \"my Father and I will make our abode in him\"", "title": "Trinitarianism and the Spirit", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T17:53:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ztEGYf_3c0", "description": "There is a TV series based on the book, with Alan Rickman as the odious Obadiah Slope.\nIt was made 20+ years ago (the production values aren't what we're used to now) but it is amusing!\n\nThe 100 Books (So Far)\n--------------------------------\n*Book Title - Author - Year Of First Publication (Author's Country Of Origin)*\n\nPicture Books\nThe Tale Of Peter Rabbit - Beatrix Potter - 1902 (England) - #60\nThe Little Engine That Could - Watty Piper - 1930 (U.S.) - #59\nCurious George - Margret and H.A.

This metal has the greatest electrochemical potential and provides the greatest energy thickness. At the same time the high activity of the lithium metal significantly complicates the production processes. The requirements with respect to the current source tightness in this case are also extemely high. All of this ultimately impacts the cost of these power elements.       If compared to the saline and alkaline batteries, the lithium current sources have a number of important advantages.       Their main benefit is the high specific energy thickness. So, at dimensions equal to those of their counterparts, lithium components have the greatest energy content, and are thus able to support longer operation.       Another important feature is the long storage period, which reaches 10, and in some cases, even 15 years! This is possible thanks to the extremely low charge currents. The typical self-discharge current normally decreases the rated capacity by a maximum of 1% per year. This means that the element's charge would theoretically only drop by 10% in 10 years.       These power elements provide reliable supply of power for devices requiring a lot of energy for operation. Such devices include, for example, digital cameras, players, metal detectors, flashlights, etc. Lithium batteries work up to 7 times longer than their alkaline counterparts in devices with high energy consumption. They have virtually the same capacity at low and high discharge currents. The AAA capacity is 1,100 milliampere-hours, the AA capacity -- 2,900 milliampere-hours.        Lithium batteries are also light weight -- 33% lighter than the alkaline ones. They work under extremely high and low temperatures, and contain no hazardous components, like mercury or lead.", "title": "Camelion Lithium Batteries", "publishedDate": "2012-02-20T00:41:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0-2_xSzjfC0", "description": "Mad Mad Brother returns!

I felt compelled to share my teeth whitening story with the world. By no means am I an expert, a dentist or some kind of health professional. I'm just an ordinary woman that stumbled upon a teeth whitening solution that works fast. If you are considering a teeth whitening product, hopefully my story will inspire you to try my tooth whitening method at home. Whiten teeth works much better than any makeup: eyes, lips, face...if you want to get compliments - start from your teeth! I will show you exactly how I whitened my teeth fast and was forced to give up all the famous teeth whitening solutions, and a wide range of other useless whitening products. I have tried everything to whiten my teeth, toothpastes, mouth washes, strips, home remedies, &  a few of the professional ones and nothing worked for me in the long term. I was getting a little desperate at this point, my teeth were the \"ugliest stained yellow\" they have ever been! The really sad part was that I started to withdraw from social situations because I was so embarrassed to smile. Nothing turns someone off like a mouthful of yellow teeth. Luckily, I was watching the news one night when I saw an investigative report where a well known California dentist was talking about the new advancements with at home tooth whitening products. I was shocked to learn that you can get the same treatment offered by leading cosmetic dental offices and is now available for anyone to use SAFELY at home.

YouTube is just one of the biggest search engines made use of on the planet today. Craigslist Anchorage is the biggest classified ads Website system on earth.\n\nIf I was doing your best to offer a used iPhone or a Four-wheeler I would not create a YouTube video and have it show up on the initial page of Google to sell it. I would offer the used item on Craigslist Anchorage. Where I live I might possibly offer it within 24 hrs without any inquiries asked and the next point you know I would have the money in my pocket. So due to this I enjoy Craigslist Anchorage. Craigslist Anchorage is remarkable but below's the thing guys when I initially started trying to offer products as an incomes individual on Craigslist Anchorage I didn't Recognize exactly what a genuine marketing expert appears like.\n\nCraigslist Anchorage is almost like an incomes system not an Advertising and marketing Site.\n\nBut if you're trying to be a marketing expert for a business and you visit YouTube and you develop a project and you set it up and you start acquiring thousands of individuals to see your discussions from your videos many people will see your URL or telephone numbers and you will get the website traffic you need to control. YouTube is way more of a marketing strategy system because you can do a video one time and it can potentially go viral.\n\nCraigslist Anchorage: Because YouTube is an online search engine a great deal of individuals go to Google and placed in \"accessories shops in such and such community\" or \"get listed here pay listed here dealership in Anchorage Alaska\" whatever it may be. When individuals are finding these Keywords they're looking for responses and they intend to check out videos! So our job is to give them what they wish if they are searching for particular item in your city your YouTube video clip on the initial page of Google the consumer is going to select that YouTube video and an area of these individuals will definitely watch your YouTube video clip and they will definitely show up at your company and purchase your product or service.\n\nCraigslist Anchorage: So the YouTube advertising system Will show you how you can find the key words that people are searching for in your location and then we will certainly instruct you how to develop YouTube video clips on a Mac or COMPUTER After that the system will instruct you how you can optimize your video to actually appear on the initial page of Google so you get the website traffic.

Unless the Speaker rules C-38 out of order, these will now be voted on this week in the House.\n\n\"Our amendments are a direct result of the historic unfairness and fraudulence of the 420-page omnibus budget bill.  Parliament has a duty to review and amend a bill which changes, repeals, and overhauls 70 different laws, going far beyond the original 2012 budget,\" said May.  May is still waiting for the Speaker to rule on her Point of Order relating to the illegitimacy of the bill. \n\n\"Our goal is to lessen the damage the Harper Conservatives are determined to inflict on everything from the environment to our pensions.  We propose very valid and necessary amendments to Bill C-38 which reflect most Canadians' concerns.\"\n\nThe 320 amendments include changes to the new Canadian Environment Assessment Act; undoing damage to habitat protection provisions in the Fisheries Act, and removing certain clauses in the National Energy Board Act.\n\nOther amendments deal with charity laws, oversight of CSIS, and allowing US law enforcement officers onto Canadian territory to make arrests.\n\nMay noted that the coming week would be of historic significance which could likely be marked by hours, perhaps days, of voting now that the Harper Conservatives have refused to negotiate with the Opposition.\n\n\"The Harper Conservatives have no mandate for their anti-nature, anti-social programmes, anti-sovereignty agenda. The Opposition is simply trying to uphold the values of Canadians, as evidenced by the overwhelming outcry from citizens,\" said May\n\nAs well as the 320 substantive amendments, the Green Party has submitted 28 deletion amendments, which overlap with other Opposition submissions and will probably be grouped together for voting purposes.  Currently, there are a total of 871 amendments on the order paper for Report Stage of Bill C-38.\n\n\"The extent of the amendments to this 'ominous' budget bill reveal the concern of Parliament with Harper's ruthless and undemocratic tactics.  He rolled the dice that democracy could be ignored. He was wrong.\"\n\nBackgrounders\n\n1.

The stucco extends to the soil without the benefit of a weep-screed. Weep screed is a horizontal strip of metal that isolates the stuccoed house walls from the foundation and allows them to move independent of the foundation. This not only prevents cosmetic horizontal cracks that are commonly seen at the base of many stuccoed walls but also isolates the stucco from the soil and inhibits the wicking effect of moisture being drawn up into the stucco which in turn creates the flaking and peeling that is common on such surfaces. Also, the absence of weep screed can lead to moisture-related problems. Therefore, the base of the walls on the inside should be monitored for any signs of moisture damage or mold, which is apparent in this home.

With this gage the process of tramming is greatly simplified and can be completed in a fraction of the time compared to conventional tramming techniques. We guarantee that the Pro Tram will take the hassle out of tramming a milling machine. The Pro Tram system eliminates the need swing your indicator back and forth 180 degrees during tramming procedure. Just adjust the head until both gages read the same number and you can be certain that your spindle is perfectly square. Designed for use with Bridgeport style milling machines and CNC mills.\n\u2022 Large 2.2\" easy to read indicator face. \n\u2022 Gage repeatability 0.0002\"\n\u2022 Large 5\" distance between indicators to ensure that the mill head is as square to the table as possible. \n\u2022 Calibration gage block included.\n\u2022 Large 1/2\" shank.\n\u2022 Durable padded case included.\n\nTramming is the process of squaring the head of your mill to the table. Most machinists know that if your mill is not trammed properly surface finishes will be poor and parts will not be flat or square. Most machinists also know that conventional tramming techniques can be tedious and time consuming. The Pro Tram by Edge Technology solves all of these problems allowing you to tram your mill quickly and accurately. To use the Pro Tram simply lower the unit down onto the table and adjust the head until both indicators read the same number. Repeat this process for the opposite axis and you are done. It's that easy. The Pro Tram is also sized perfectly to fit the bed of a 6 inch vise allowing you to tram the head to the vise instead of the table. The Pro Tram is a must have if you need to rotate the head to a precision angle. Calibration of the Pro Tram is easy, just place the included calibration magnet anywhere on the table and lower the first indicator down onto it. Set that indicator to zero and with the quill locked rotate the unit and repeat the process by setting the second indicator on the calibration magnet and setting it to zero as well. Since this calibration process accounts for any inaccuracy with the collet or spindle it makes the Pro Tram the most accurate tramming gage available. If you want to spend less time tramming your mill and more time machining parts then you need the Pro Tram by Edge Technology. Check out our ever expanding product line at edgetechnologyproducts.com.

The bonus\nis teaching' rappers how to rock beats without being misogynistic or homophobic.\nThey say hip-hop's dead, laying next to chivalry,\nBut I'm treating women respectfully and outlivin' these spittled beats.\n\nI do it for the love and to hold up Vietnam's energy.\nStandin up for certain issues while others still choose to live a life that sedentary.\nSee I reserve my apathy for the haters that be lackin' love.\nSo for Youtube comments I don't give a fuck, but Luckily Adam does.", "title": "Lima Limon - Adam Ivy Cypher Vol. 3", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T04:27:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0-RauNoxOXg", "description": "", "title": "Literacy Training Phonological Awareness Rhyming", "publishedDate": "2011-01-28T15:53:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0-RbPgAQQsI", "description": "Aufnahmen eines juv.

Both of the workers suffered chemical burns to their legs, and Smith suffered a fracture to the leg. Burns said the workers' injuries were pretty serious and not life threatening. The tank could be seen in the rear of a truck bearing the company name SimplexGrinnell. A phone call to the company at a number in Clifton Park produced no new information.Burns said besides the injuries the explosion caused no damage. Even the tank appeared to be mostly intact.

The native soil is compacted sand and DG, so it is easier to build up than to amend.  Almost all of the examples of hugelkultur out there now are in temperate zones.  I am in an arid zone, so this is a bit experimental.  This is the original terrace that I built using these same principles.\n\nTerrace Construction:\nThe terrace walls were constructed using old plywood that I got off of Craigslist.  The wall was then faced (and later sealed) with cedar fencing for aesthetics.  A trench was dug across the slope to serve as the footing for the wall.  The bottom of the trench was dug level, so that it could serve as a swale.  The trench was also dug up slope to accommodate the sides of the wall.  The spoil from the trench was thrown into the bed to cover a thick layer of organic material.  To create the hugelkulture bed I stacked up old logs, stumps, cactus pads, lumber, and palm fronds that were all obtained on site.  The woody material was then covered in a layer of sand from the trench.  Then covered with a layer of homemade compost.  Finally it was topped with a layer of mushroom compost that I had delivered.  A pathway was dug level on the upside of the terrace.  That spoil went into the bed.  The pathway was dug as level as possible to serve as a swale.  I then back-filled the pathway with a woody chipped mulch.  The downside of the terrace will also be turned into a pathway at a later date.  I chose the cedar because it will last and I like the look of it.  I am trying to show people that permaculture can also look upscale while still being functional.", "title": "Hugelkultur Terrace #1 - Arid Dryland Water Harvesting", "publishedDate": "2012-05-16T16:36:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0-XW8-_shnE", "description": "Reprise des Beatles \"Yesterday\" par Ad\u00e9lie.\nJe participe \u00e0 un concours de talents f\u00e9minins organis\u00e9 par My major company, si la video vous pla\u00eet je vous encourage \u00e0 voter pour \"yesterday\" d'Ad\u00e9lie sur le site bemusictalents.be.com Merci", "title": "ADELIE YESTERDAY", "publishedDate": "2012-02-05T18:07:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "0-Xlqebz9PY", "description": "Mix de Top Plays sur LoL avec de la Zizou de qualit\u00e9.

Initially he worked as a rigger on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but during the 1970s he developed his own television comedy sketch programme. \"The Paul Hogan Show\" ran for 60 episodes between 1973 and 1984, and was popular amongst Australians for its larrikin \"Aussie\" humour. In 1986, Hogan co-produced and starred in \"Crocodile Dundee\" as a down-to-earth hunter travelling from the Australian Outback to New York City. It remains Australia's most successful film to date.\n\nThe joke of the day: I have been in many places, but I've never been in Cahoots. \n\nApparently, you can't go alone. You have to be in Cahoots with someone.\n\nI've also never been Incognito. I hear no one recognizes you there.\n\nI have, however, been in Sane. They don't have an airport; you have to be driven there. I have made several trips there, thanks to my friends, family and work.\n\nI would like to go to Conclusions, but you have to jump, and I'm not too much on physical activity anymore.\n\nI have also been in Doubt. That is a sad place to go, and I try not to visit there too often.\n\nI've been in Flexible, but only when it was very important to stand firm.\n\nSometimes I'm in Capable, and I go there more often as I'm getting older.\n\nOne of my favourite places to be is in Suspense! It really gets the adrenalin flowing and pumps up the old heart! At my age I need all the stimuli I can get!\n\nAnd, sometimes I think I am in Vincible but life shows me I am not!\n\nThe random question of the day: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can, What can you touch?\n\nLeave your answer below this video and if you're up for it, tell us about your adventures under this sun.

The Shul sits at the intersection of Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Indian Creek Village and Surfside in Florida. \n\nFounded at the direction of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, and under the guidance of Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar, The Shul is a spiritual guidepost and service center for the community to express their spiritual needs and gain inspiration to develop the same while connecting with Almighty G-d. The Shul is referred to as a \"Community House of G-d\" -- a spiritual lighthouse from where holiness and G-dliness emanate to the entire community. \n\nThe Shul is based on the ideology of Chabad Lubavitch, which has at its foundation based on the encompassing mitzvah \"to love every Jew as one loves himself\" and to permeate that love with Acts of Kindness, Mitzvahs, Torah Study and Prayer.

High Park Allotment Garden. Storing  seed potatoes underground for winter. \nPotato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow about 60 cm (24 in) high, depending on variety, the culms dying back after flowering. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers tend to have pinkish skins. Potatoes are cross-pollinated mostly by insects, including bumblebees, which carry pollen from other potato plants, but a substantial amount of self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.\nPotato plants\nAfter potato plants flower, some varieties produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing up to 300 true seeds. Potato fruit contains large amounts of the toxic alkaloid solanine and is therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \"true seed\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. By finely chopping the fruit and soaking it in water, the seeds separate from the flesh by sinking to the bottom after about a day (the remnants of the fruit float). Any potato variety can also be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers, cut to include at least one or two eyes, or also by cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Some commercial potato varieties do not produce seeds at all (they bear imperfect flowers) and are propagated only from tuber pieces. Confusingly, these tubers or tuber pieces are called \"seed potatoes\".

Two types of bacteria were sprayed: Inactivated Serratia marcescens (ISM); and live Bacillus globigii (BG).

The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactarius piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland.

We know the truth and we stand Steadfast and Immovable in it. It also says that Chirst is a beacon in the darkness and I related this unto a lighthouse. When the ships are being tossed at sea, they may see a lighthouse in the dark and they go towards that light. When we are having our own storm at sea and are being tossed around we just have to look for the light (Jesus Christ) and follow Him. We will move forward to Christ and our testimonies will grow if we stay Steadfast and Immovable in Christ and His gospel. \n\nWords:\n\nAs the rising generation\nWe have learned the gospel plan\nAll the storms of change around us\nChallenge faith on every hand.\n\n(Chorus)\nSteadfast and Immovable \nStanding true unto our Lord\nMoving forward strong in courage\nFaithful to His glorious word.\n\nLike a beacon in the darkness\nSending shinning beams of light\nAll the words of Christ before us\nShow us the way to win the fight.\n\n(Chorus)\nSteadfast and Immovable \nStanding true unto our Lord\nMoving forward strong in courage\nFaithful to His glorious word.\n\nEven our trials grow stronger\nStill our hope does not grow dim\nAnd we know when serving others\nWe are truly serving Him.\n\n(Chorus)\nSteadfast and Immovable \nStanding true unto our Lord\nMoving forward strong in courage\nFaithful to His glorious word.", "title": "Steadfast and Immovable- 2008 Mutual Theme", "publishedDate": "2008-10-30T02:24:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "002m_V0ayo8", "description": "", "title": "Sudan categorisation", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T19:22:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "002uFrqKjm8", "description": "Gabriel Faur\u00e9 was born in Pamiers, Ari\u00e8ge, Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 Faur\u00e9 (1810--85) and Marie-Antoinette-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lal\u00e8ne-Laprade (1809--87).\n \nFaur\u00e9 is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or m\u00e9lodie. His devotion to the m\u00e9lodie spans his career, from the ever-fresh \"Le papillon et la fleur\" of 1861 to the masterly cycle L'horizon chim\u00e9rique, composed sixty years and more than a hundred songs later. Faur\u00e9's songs are now core repertoire for students and professionals, sung in conservatories and recital halls throughout the world.\n \nFaur\u00e9's haunting Madrigal (Opus 35) is at first a dialogue between the young men and women of the world, and later an admonishment to both by the older, wiser heads around them. The opening melodic idea is an exact quote of the Armand Silvestre's poem Aus tiefer Noth (Out of deep need), perhaps used as a joke by Faur\u00e9 for his friend, Andr\u00e9 Messager, who received the piece as a wedding gift in 1883.\n \nAlthough this piece was originally written for Chorus and Piano or Orchestra, I arranged it for Piano and Woodwind Quartet (Flute, Oboe, Clarinet & Bassoon).", "title": "\"Madrigal\" (Opus 35) for Piano & Woodwind Quartet", "publishedDate": "2012-10-22T00:48:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "002xk-VID2E", "description": "\u041b\u044b\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0430 - Fulica atra (\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u044f). \u0427\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0437\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u044e\u0433\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0437\u043b\u0430. \u041d\u0430 \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043e \u0435\u0451 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0420\u0424.", "title": "\u041b\u044b\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0430 Fulica atra L.", "publishedDate": "2013-08-24T05:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "003XA4IEVlY", "description": "Dr. Chris Rehm discusses why a pet's ear can become infected and what medication or treatment could work best for your pet.", "title": "Ears", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T18:22:35.000Z"}]
