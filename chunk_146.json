(Preheat to 400)\n\n- Grate the cheese into thin shavings by running a finely honed elven dagger over the block.\n\n- Separate the egg whites from the yolks, and beat the whites vigorously until they thicken.\n\n- Begin preparation of the signature Sunshine Sauce:\n      - Melt the butter, and add in the flour while stirring continuously until well blended. \n      - Move the mixture to a smaller flame and begin gently stirring in the milk. It is crucial that you do not stop stirring! \n      - Continue to do so for ten minutes, until the mixture thickens. Then, and only then, will the Sunshine Sauce be considered ready.\n\n- Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg, and remove from the flame.\n\n- Add in the grated cheese, and then the egg yolks. Stir well until fully blended. Then, gently add in the egg whites with a spoon made of carved hickory wood. (fold the egg whites in gently, making sure to not destroy air bubbles)\n\n- Gently pour the mix into four stonework souffle' dishes, filling each nearly (but not quite!) to the top. (if you'd like, prepare the souffle dishes beforehand by coating them in butter and grated parmersan cheese)\n\n- Put the dishes in your moderately hot oven and shut that door! Keep sealed for 25 minutes, or your scrumptious suns will rise, only to fall down flat into the oven's abyss. (put in oven and immediately reduce heat to 375 degrees. Bake until the souffles rise and tops are browned.

Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw.\n\n\"friday night lights\",\"friday night lights clip\",\"friday night lights speech\",\"friday night lights trailer\",\"billy bob thornton\",\"lucas black\",\"derek luke\",\"garrett hedlund\",\"jay hernandez\",\"lee thompson young\",\"lee jackson\",\"kam hunt\",\"billy melvin thomas\",\"peter berg\",\"sports dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",drama,\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on real life\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++303779,/m/093fhd,/m/03fcgz,/m/04rhq4,/m/0b_h517,/m/03mzfd,/m/01fh9,/m/084t44", "title": "Friday Night Lights (8/10) Movie CLIP - Ivory's Pep Talk (2004) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T11:47:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8CZ1ipjn1fg", "description": "MDS = Meftha Dewo Silky , terfikir terkenang masa kecil, oke akhirnya video bawain soundtrack opening kera sakti ini terlakukan. enjoy ! thankyou :)", "title": "OST kera sakti sun gokong (cover) - MEFTHA DEWO SILKY (better quality)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T00:51:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8CZTAgG847I", "description": "animatie", "title": "Olga-van-de-wolga-2010.WMV", "publishedDate": "2010-10-12T19:42:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8CZZ0V8VHe4", "description": "Check out our weekly show, \"The Normal Show\".

It comes in a wide range of widths from 4\" to 16\".  With 2\" of foam on each side of the block, the insulation is built in!  The structure for interior walls as well as exterior covering is also built into the block in the form of a plastic tie. Once the forms are installed, concrete is pumped into the form and at the end of the day you have a concrete wall with insulation and nailing strips installed.  \n\n\nEnergy Savings -  Protect the environment while saving money.\nWith an overall lower energy consumption, ICF construction is a great way to protect the environment.

Based on the popular Sour Then Sweet\u00ae candy Sour Patch Kids\u00ae, the game will take players on a journey from the perspective of a lost piece of candy finding its way to its ultimate destination -- the human stomach.\n\n\"Sour Patch\u00ae is the #1 all sour candy brand in the U.S. but there is so much more to these iconic characters than just their sour exteriors and sweet interiors,\" said Sebastian Genesio, Marketing Director for Sour Patch. \"Bringing our 'lost kids' to life in video game form will add a new dimension to these lovable snacks. We feel this video game will resonate strongly with our core audience of teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"Sour Patch has brought its brand to life in a unique experience that only video games can deliver,\" said Christian Svensson, Senior Vice President, Planning & Strategy, Capcom Entertainment, Inc. \"Whether you're a fan of Sour Patch Kids or fun and engaging gameplay, World Gone Sour has something for all gamers to enjoy.\"\n\nGamers will take on the miniature role of a lost Sour Patch Kid in a stylized human-sized world, guiding the hero through the sticky floors of a movie theater, across the counter of a concession stand, and other unique and oversized environments.  Joining forces with fellow lost Sour Patch Kids, players will use a combination of jumps, twists and puzzle-solving to negotiate and overcome larger than life obstacles. Along the way, they will battle unusual candy enemies, escape from deranged humans, and face-off against bizarre creatures including one very angry wad of sticky chewing gum.\n\nPlayers will be able to team up with one friend for local co-op play. The console version will include support for global leaderboards, as well as Microsoft Achievements or PlayStation\u00ae trophies. World Gone Sour will be available this winter for $4.99 on PC and this spring on PlayStation\u00aeNetwork for $4.99 and on Xbox LIVE Arcade for 400 Microsoft Points.\n\nABOUT SOUR PATCH KIDS\nSour Patch candies were launched in 1985 and have long been a favorite among people of all ages.  Sour Patch is known for its \"Sour Then Sweet taste sensation,\" in which the sour coating gives a real sour hit in the mouth, but quickly turns sweet to offer a satisfying candy treat. Today,  Sour Patch is the #1 selling all sour candy brand in the U.S. marketplace[1]. The  Sour Patch family of soft and chewy candy products includes  Sour Patch Kids,  Sour Patch Watermelon,  Sour Patch Kids Berries\u00ae, Sour Patch Extreme\u00ae,  and Sour Patch Xploderz\u00ae. To learn more about  Sour Patch Soft and Chewy Candy, visit www.sourpatch.com.\n\nABOUT CAPCOM\nCapcom is a leading worldwide developer, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment for game consoles, PCs, handheld and wireless devices.

It's far more convenient than running a bunch of extension cords from your generator to your house.\n\nInstallation of a transfer switch is very easy and in most cases will take less then one hour.  The 18-inch flexible conduit whip attaches easily to the load center and all wires are clearly marked.  Simply select the circuits needed in an emergency and connect them to the Pro/Tran wire leads.  It is recommended to use a professional electrician.\n\nTo make sure you and your generator are ready for a power outage connect the cord to the generator and then to the transfer switch. The connector should be pushed in then rotated to lock in place.  Start your generator and wait for the engine to warm up to operate smoothly.  \n\nThe switches on the transfer switch are normally in the line position, move the switches to the \"gen\" position one at a time.  The key circuits in your home are now being powered by the generator.  There is no need to turn off the main circuit breaker or any of the individual breakers in the main panel. When the utility power comes back on move the switches back to the line position turn off the generator and put the power cable away \n\nFor more information please visit our web site at http://www.generatorfactoryoutlet.com and learn more about all of our portable generators and other fine products.", "title": "Reliance Controls Indoor Transfer Switch", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T22:18:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8D2z24us_GI", "description": "Como hacer flores en frivolite turco.\nHow to make flowers in Turkish tatting.\nwww.entrelanzaderas.blogspot.com", "title": "Frivolite Tatting lesson 137 - Flores Oya flowers", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T12:42:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8D3ARh6wkdM", "description": "OWN SONG XX", "title": "Jimara Tjin Kon Kiem -", "publishedDate": "2014-06-29T19:13:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8D3earVs2B8", "description": "Fungicida bot\u00e1nico que contiene como ingredientes activos resinas y \u00e1cidos org\u00e1nicos (\u00e1cido nordihidroguayar\u00e9tico) extra\u00eddos de la gobernadora, que inhiben la germinaci\u00f3n de esporas y el crecimiento de hongos y bacterias que afectan a los cultivos. \u00datil para el control de manchas (Alternaria sp., Cercospora sp.), secadera o damping-off (Rhizoctonia sp., Fusarium sp. y Pythium sp.), enfermedades de granos almacenados (Aspergillus sp. y Penicillium sp.) y enfermedades bacteriales (Xanthomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp. y Erwinia sp.).", "title": "Progranic Mega", "publishedDate": "2009-04-28T23:20:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8D3guBwMqVM", "description": "", "title": "Faecal Sudge Reuse", "publishedDate": "2011-04-19T09:59:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8D3gvvLDakY", "description": "\"line formation\" in school, Chinese version.\ntranslation: (1) arms forward.

Dry shampoo, we typically think about for day two hair, or oily hair or something like that. A really great way to use it is more as a texturizing spray, which is how we're going to use it today.\n\nSo we are going to concentrate a little less emphasis on the root, and a little bit more all throughout. So as I go along, you'll see that I am spraying it kind of from root to the midshaft, and that's going to give us a lot of great texture happening all throughout.\n\nSo I'm going to start on the underside of the hair. This hairspray is Brocato's Big Easy. It's one of my favorites. I would definitely, for this type of style, use a dry shampoo that was not color, because like I said, you will be going over more than just the traditional.\n\nSo I'm going to start close to the root, and I'm going to zigzag all the way up. I'm going to drop that hair down. I'm going to do the same. And I'm going to basically, go through and do that everywhere. And I will say, a number one fear, why people don't use dry shampoo is, they're afraid that it's going to leave a white residue in their hair, especially if they have dark hair. I try to use this hair powder one Halloween to give somebody the illusion of gray temples. I thought it would work just fine. He has really dark hair. I could not get it to last, no matter how much I used. It always dissipated. So, don't be nervous. Even if you see a white powder to the hair, it will not stay.\n\nSo now, especially in the crown, we're lifting the hair up and massaging it in. All right. Now it's already pretty big, but what I'm going to do, is I'm going to have the model flip upside and then I'm going to actually brush through her hair. So go ahead and toss under. Actually, I might as well put a little more in. This is certainly not a thrifty way to use hair powder, but who cares.\n\nAlso go in with a blow dryer on a cool setting, and do it that way. All right, go ahead and flip up. So as you can see, just by using dry shampoo in a new way, I've given her a full look without teasing or anything like that. And it's just given it a beachy texture. This is really beautiful on blondes, especially. But like I said, don't be afraid to do something like this if you have a little darker hair also. A cute thing to do too, would be to go in and maybe put some curls in, maybe just bump it around the face, something like that, just to give it a little more purposeful look. Do the same, here on the other side. And that is one my favorite ways to get big hair using dry shampoo.", "title": "How to Create Volume with Dry Shampoo | Hair Tutorials", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T01:27:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DB_h_n421s", "description": "An overview of Mt.

You can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfDPvM2CZGo\nI found it interesting, and especially because he did not show the redstone and commands behind it like he usually does, I thought it would be nice to try and recreate it but make a fire engine instead of an ambulance.\n\nI didn't come up with the main ideas behind this. It works in a very similar way to Sethbling's ambulance. It surprisingly didn't need that much redstone. I tried to explain how it works the best I could.\n\nSome extra information I left out of the video:\nI had to spawn the \"fire engine\" at most 12 blocks away diagonally from me, any more than that and it wouldn't chase the sheep most of the time. I'm pretty sure Sethbling's ambulance was spawning further away than that. I think he did that by increasing the generic.followRange attribute of the wolf but I couldn't get it to work with commands.\nThe sheep spawns with a slowness effect with a very high amplifier to stop it from moving around. This doesn't always work for some reason though.\nThe wolves and ocelots are teleported into the void because I couldn't get a stack of mobs to die with the /kill command. Teleporting the wolf on the other hand seems to kill off the whole stack. After relogging into the world the minecarts and villagers were appearing again though, and that's why I added the last 2 command blocks.\nThe /fill command was not always replacing all the water above me with air. I fixed it by activating the command block again after an 8 tick delay.\n\nThis isn't like my usual videos but I hope you enjoy! :)", "title": "Fire Engine in Minecraft (response to Sethbling's Ambulance in Minecraft)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T13:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DQDmRv4A2Y", "description": "Afinal, a \u00e1gua do mundo vai acabar?

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fourth main game in the Batman: Arkham series. Kevin Conroy will once again voice Batman. Arkham Knight is scheduled to be released worldwide on October 14, 2014.\n\nThe game's main storyline is set one year after that of 2011's Batman: Arkham City and follows Batman, at the peak of his ability, as he confronts the supervillain Scarecrow, who has returned to Gotham City to unite Batman's enemies in a plot to finally kill the Dark Knight\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nMany gadgets and gameplay elements from previous Arkham games return, including the grapnel gun, line launcher and batarangs, the countering system and detective vision.[2] Batman can use some gadgets while flying, such as batarangs or the line-launcher. The character can fly throughout the city using his cape, with gliding now allowing for longer sustained flights, steeper dives and higher climbs. The grapnel gun can now be used to instantly switch directions during a glide.[3]\n\nChanges to the combat system include the ability to combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting the streak.[3] Batman can also counter enemy attacks, and throw them into other enemies for increased damage. Typical enemies are now capable of performing a charge and tackle attack only used by larger enemies in previous games; precision timed dodging and a batarang can instantly defeat some charging enemies. Batman can now access grates from far away, allowing him to roll forward and immediately get under the grate if in range, instead of having to be right on top of them, while also initiating multiple takedowns from within them. Arkham Knight introduces \"Fear Takedown\", where Batman can subdue up to three enemies simultaneously as long as he remains undetected; time is slowed after each take down, allowing the player to target the next enemy.[4] Hazardous items within the area, such as power generators, can be integrated into combat for environmental attacks.[2][3] Batman is also capable of disarming enemies wielding items like baseball bats, and using the acquired weapon on several foes before it breaks.[5] Some enemies are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman.[6]\n\nThe game introduces Batman's car, the Batmobile, as a drivable vehicle.[7] The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player's location at will, while on foot or, if airborne, the car can be sent to meet Batman as he lands.[8][2] The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades and trees, and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. At specific locations, Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.[2][9] Some enemies will run away at the sight of the vehicle, eliminating the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses.[10] Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities.[6] Riddler Trophies return, now including objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as a timed race in an underground tunnel that uses radar pulses to change parts of the track.\n\nSubscribe 2: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Zzk1VINgDxLP_v9a5LzNw\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jacob.rodgers.79", "title": "Batman: Arkham Knight - Trailer (HD)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T07:49:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DXTNEPqcVo", "description": "A useful approach option and mind game tool for Sheik.

On 24 April 2004, the first day of patrols inside the territorial waters of Iraq following an extended training and repair period, FIREBOLT was tasked with maintaining an established exclusion zone around the Khawr al Amaya Oil Terminal by querying vessels and approaching as necessary to direct them clear.  An unidentified dhow was detected by the boarding team traveling along a course that would take it in close to the oil terminal and the RHIB was maneuvered to query and intercept.   At intercept, the dhow did not answer bridge-to-bridge queries, was unresponsive to loud-hailer directions, and maintained a direct course for the terminal.   Abruptly, the dhow altered course toward the FIREBOLT RHIB and exploded at close range, violently throwing the security team into the water and overturning the RHIB.

In my tests, using Slice & Dice / Blitz Ace + Attack Reels took the same amount of time as Slice & Dice + Oblivion. However, Oblivion is better than Attack Reels because it requires no concentration and you can't mess it up.\n\nStrategy:\n\nStart out by Mixing any combination of the four common spheres (Power, Mana, Speed, Ability) to inflict Armor Break on Ironclad. Then use Slice & Dice. Tidus needs to have low HP, Luck, and Evasion so that Ironclad's counterattack restores the party's overdrive gauges. Having Tidus as the character who gets hit by Ironclad's counterattack helps ensure proper turn order. Finally, Summon Anima and finish Ironclad off with Oblivion.\n\nI had Rikku and Yuna with lower Agility than Tidus to further ensure the proper turn order. The Agilities should be such that Yuna never gets her turn before Tidus and Rikku never gets a second turn (unless there is a Preemptive Strike). Rikku needs First Strike to go first and someone needs Initiative to prevent Ambushes. Rikku and Yuna should have Double or Triple Overdrive. \n\nIt helps to have Auto-Haste, because it speeds some of the animations up. It is also easiest to select Anima from the Summon menu if you don't have Yojimbo and the Magus Sisters yet. If you mess up Slice & Dice, just have Anima do a regular attack before she uses Oblivion.\n\nMath:\n\nWith this strategy, you can Overkill Ironclad in an average of 70 seconds. That means it takes about 35 seconds to get one item from Ironclad. To figure out how many HP Spheres you get per minute, you use (7 battles * 2 HP Spheres per battle) / ((70 seconds per battle * 8 battles) / 60 seconds per minute) = 1.5 HP Spheres per minute.\n\nIf you want 333 HP Spheres to get 99,999 HP, you will spend about (333 HP Spheres / 1.5 HP Spheres per minute) / 60 minutes per hour = 3.7 hours fighting Ironclad. As a byproduct, you will get about 47 Dark Matters.\n\nNote: If you are playing the North American or Japanese version of FFX, you need to use Wakka instead of Yuna and Attack Reels instead of Oblivion because Oblivion cannot do more than 99,999 damage.", "title": "Final Fantasy X: Best Ironclad Strategy (1.5 HP Spheres / Minute)", "publishedDate": "2010-08-10T04:59:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Decq8D3RBI", "description": "(magyarul l\u00e1sd lent)\nThis video recording of a flowering cross-leaved gentian (Gentiana cruciata L.) was made in Nagymez\u0151, in the B\u00fckk region of Hungary, on 22 July 2004.\n---------------------------------\nA B\u00fckki Nagymez\u0151n k\u00e9sz\u00fclt a vide\u00f3 egy vir\u00e1gz\u00f3 t\u00e1rnicsr\u00f3l (Gentiana cruciata L.) 2004 J\u00falius 22-\u00e9n.

The police have recovered two country-made pistols and 11 live bullets, apart from other lethal weapons and a car worth about Rs eight lakh from the arrested. \n\nThe gang, it is said, was hatching a plan to threaten, attack commuters and rob them of their valuables at HRBR Colony.

Suleiman Khan had received the consignment, police said.\n\nPolice sources said Suleiman Khan too was arrested in a similar case in 2011, when he had procured illegal weapons and was trying to sell them to another notorious rowdy of the City, Ismail Sharif alias Nana.

I can't think of traits better suited to making. I've tried meditation in the past, but it didn't seem to stick. When I saw that NeuroSky's Mindwave headsets had dropped to $100, I couldn't resist trying meditation again, this time with feedback. These headsets measure electrical signals from your brain and determine two main metrics: attention and meditation. The charts and graphs in the headset's app worked well enough for measuring attention, but the very nature of meditation is that you can't focus on charts and graphs while doing it. I set out to build a more peaceful and serene visual output for my headset, one that would actually serve to calm me even further as it displayed the depth of my meditation.\n\nMy Brainwave-Controlled Zen Garden is similar to a standard desktop zen garden in that you rake sand to calm yourself. In my version, though, the rake and resultant patterns are controlled by your actual brainwaves. If you are tense and worrisome, the rake moves randomly and quickly, scribbling odd patterns in the sand.\n\nRead more on MAKE: http://makezine.com/video/making-fun-brainwave-controlled-zen-garden/", "title": "Making Fun: Brainwave Zen Garden", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T17:00:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DfNbOiTbT4", "description": "", "title": "Glee | 5x09 Scene #4 \"Frenemies\" | Rachel & Santana 's Fight | HD | Pezberry | Rachel Slaps Santana", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T06:20:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DfTEmMiKh8", "description": "Toby takes us deeper into the more advanced aspects of this mindblowing new mod that harnesses elements of Quantum Mechanics within Minecraft. \n\nFrom the Minecraft minds behind ComputerCraft (DanTwoHundred), and the team at MinecraftEdu, in collaboration with many others.\n\nCheck it out HERE: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2035719-152forgesspsmp-qcraft-quantum-physics-meets-minecraft/", "title": "Mod Spotlight: qCraft - \"Quantum Computers and Teleportation\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T16:28:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DfZXImf7dw", "description": "A 2014-es gy\u0171r\u0171z\u00e9si sorozat szezonz\u00e1r\u00f3 j\u00e9gmadara az \u00d3csai Mad\u00e1rv\u00e1rt\u00e1n.

NICOGRAPH International 2011, P02 (CD-ROM)\nThis paper describes a method to render envelopment surface of falling water in an interactive manipulation model of virtual liquid that we have proposed for virtual reality system. We have already proposed an interactive manipulation model of virtual liquid like water which focus on user impression and real-time processing rather than exact behavior simulation, and we have improved the stay condition water. However, free fall condition water is just simulated with particles and rendered as a particle simply. Although meatball and marching cubes method are famous to render surface calculated with particle system, these method are not appropriate for interactive manipulation system because of much calculation time and many times of data scan. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective rendering method of free fall condition water. To reduce data scanning frequency and searching pattern, it is classified into simple patterns to create process of envelopment surface from particles in the method. Then envelopment surface is rendered in real-time without parallel processing.\n\u672c\u8ad6\u6587\u3067\u306f\u3001\u6211\u3005\u306e\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308bVR\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u4eee\u60f3\u6db2\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u3001\u843d\u4e0b\u6db2\u4f53\u306e\u5305\u7d61\u9762\u63cf\u753b\u624b\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8ff0\u3079\u308b\u3002\u6211\u3005\u306f\u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306b\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306b\u53b3\u5bc6\u306a\u6319\u52d5\u3088\u308a\u3082\u4f53\u9a13\u8005\u306e\u5370\u8c61\u3068\u5b9f\u6642\u9593\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3057\u305f\u4eee\u60f3\u6db2\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u6848\u3057\u3001\u9759\u6b62\u72b6\u614b\u306e\u6db2\u4f53\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u62e1\u5f35\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u305d\u3053\u3067\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u3067\u306f\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u306b\u3088\u308a\u6319\u52d5\u3092\u8a08\u7b97\u3057\u3001\u307e\u305f\u5358\u7d14\u306b\u7c92\u5b50\u3068\u3057\u3066\u63cf\u753b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u843d\u4e0b\u6db2\u4f53\u306e\u52b9\u7387\u7684\u304b\u3064\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u63d0\u6848\u3059\u308b\u3002\u5f93\u6765\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u6cd5\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8a08\u7b97\u7d50\u679c\u306f\u3001\u30e1\u30bf\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u3084\u30de\u30fc\u30c1\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30d6\u6cd5\u306a\u3069\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u306b\u3088\u308a\u63cf\u753b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u306f\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u8d70\u67fb\u56de\u6570\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u306a\u308b\u306a\u3069\u3001\u5bfe\u8a71\u64cd\u4f5c\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u306f\u5411\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3002\u63d0\u6848\u624b\u6cd5\u3067\u306f\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u304b\u3089\u5305\u7d61\u9762\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u904e\u7a0b\u3092\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u5206\u985e\u3057\u3001\u8d70\u67fb\u56de\u6570\u3084\u63a2\u7d22\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u3092\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3001\u4e26\u5217\u8a08\u7b97\u3092\u884c\u308f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u5b9f\u6642\u9593\u3067\u306e\u5305\u7d61\u9762\u63cf\u753b\u3092\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b\u3002", "title": "Envelopment Surface Rendering of Falling Water for Virtual Liquid Manipulation Model", "publishedDate": "2012-05-08T05:46:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DiP0Vn6GxE", "description": "Years of internal conflict in Somalia have seen the country record some of the worst infant and maternal mortality rates in the world .Only a third of pregnant women in Somaliland have access to skilled personnel during delivery.

Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju held a two hour meeting this morning and, sources say, ordered that fencing at all airports should be replaced by concrete walls.\n\nJust next to the Surat airport are fields where grazing cattle are a common sight. Yesterday, one of the animals apparently entered the runway area through the breach in the perimeter that is now being repaired.\n\nThe pilot reportedly spotted the animal \"all of a sudden,\" but could not avoid the collision.\n\n\"If the plane had taken off after this, we would have crashed.

This technique, the first that can generate 3-D movies of entire brains at the millisecond timescale, could help scientists discover how neuronal networks process sensory information and generate behavior.\n\nThe team used the new system to simultaneously image the activity of every neuron in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as the entire brain of a zebrafish larva, offering a more complete picture of nervous system activity than has been previously possible.\n\nThe new approach, described May 18 in Nature Methods, could also help neuroscientists learn more about the biological basis of brain disorders. \"We don't really know, for any brain disorder, the exact set of cells involved,\" Boyden says. \"The ability to survey activity throughout a nervous system may help pinpoint the cells or networks that are involved with a brain disorder, leading to new ideas for therapies.\"\n\nRead more: https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/illuminating-neuron-activity-3-d-0518\n\nVideo: Melanie Gonick, MIT News", "title": "Neuron Activity in 3-D", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T13:30:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8DozAuuk6h4", "description": "pew pew pew pew\n\nBo has done it again!

All i can say about safety is that you shouldn't try this unless you're experienced, this stuff (especially the AP) can be unpredictable and i've heard it is even shock sensitive. If you do try this anyways, please just be smart and safe. Remember that mixing aluminium powder with AP is a big no no without mixing with the caulk first.

The President assured all Hindus of Sri Lanka that the time for liberation of their brothers and sisters in faith is near at hand, as they strive to restore freedom and democracy in full measure to the North.\n\nPrime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake in another message wished in the name of humanity that they will be able to promote mutual understanding and brotherhood among different communities in the country by displaying love and compassion on all beings.

Finding all collectibles will earn you the What's Yours is Mine trophy / achievement.\nOne collectible is obtained automatically during the prologue and cannot be missed. The rest is scattered across all main missions, client jobs and the open world (The City).\n\nTo see how many collectibles an area contains, you can open up the journal (D-Pad up), go to Player Progression and Statistics. There you'll see how many collectibles and loot items you have found in the current chapter and how many there are in total. Furthermore, there's a section called \"Collectibles\" in the journal, which lists each collectible by its name and breaks them down into categories. That makes it easier to find missing collectibles.\nAlso make sure to buy enough Rope arrows before each mission. They are often required to reach hidden areas.\n\nYou will also be shown an overview at the end of each chapter, which tells you how many items you have recovered. You can then replay the chapter immediately if you missed something. You can also replay chapters at any given time by returning to their starting point in the open world.\n\nThief Collectible Guide Playlist:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRr5L69yg_kF5k7gkvLJoJ_BzrvmQQ3Cn\n\nStarting Points of Chapters & Client Jobs:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com/guide/thief-all-starting-points-of-chapters-and-client-jobs.html\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n#START ECTORS FIRST CLIENT JOB - 0:05\n#1 - The Court of Montonessi: Guilt has Black Wings - 0:37\n#2 - Whiteridge's Duty: The Statuesque Lady - 1:09\n#3 - Client Loot: The Mechanical Hand - 1:40\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFollow Me:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx\n\nContact Me:\nmail@powerpyx.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", "title": "Thief - All Collectible Locations - Ector's Client Job 1: Hand Tailored (What's Yours is Mine)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T02:23:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EAn985UNv4", "description": "CONTACT : 0744 378 598 , SITE-URILE OFICIALE AL FORMATIEI  : \nhttp://www.formatiasiminica.ro/ \nhttp://www.dj-nunta-bacau.ro/ SAU PE FACEBOOK , \nhttps://www.facebook.com/FormatiiNunta?ref=hl ,mail:siminicabc@yahoo.com. ,FORMATIE NUNTA Focsani,FORMATII NUNTA,MUZICA NUNTA,NUNTA FORMATIE,FORMATIE CUMETRIE BACAU,FORMATII PENTRU NUNTI,FORMATIE NUNTA IASI,VASLUI,FORMATIE NUNTA SUCEAVA,FORMATIE NUNTA FOCSANI,FORMATII NUNTI BACAU,CEA MAI BUNA FORMATIE DE NUNTA DIN ROMANIA,FORMATIE NUNTA MUZICA USOARA,FORMATIE NUNTA MUZICA POPULARA DIN MOLDOVA,FORMATIE MUZICA BACAU,COLABORATORI AI FORMATIEI DE NUNTA DIN Focsani,BACAU,FORMATIE,NUNTA,FORMATII,BACAU,IASI,SUCEAVA,PIATRA NEAMT,VASLUI,FORMATIE NUNTA,FORMATII DIN BACAU, Dan Asimine solist instrumentist (orga, acordeon)MANAGER , Eusebia Asimine (solist vocal) Denisa Asimine solista muzica usoara , Mitica Chilimbar, (orga si solist vocal), Bobi Samson (saxofon,clarinet,fluier),Formatia interpreteaza o gama variata de melodii, ce cuprind toate genurile muzicale, sustinem orice tip de petrecere ~ nunti, cumetrii, onomastice, Restaurante ,Casa Grande,rest Green Park,Eclipsa,Aerostar Bacau,hotel Decebal,Antik Hemeiusi,Pensiunea Loredana,Pensiunea Casablanca,Pensiunea Ellero,Royal Garden,Imperial,hotel Magura Verde,Rest Levisticum Bacau,Rest Pasaj,Curcanul de Aur,Rest Iris,,petreceri in aer liber, Formatie  Nunta, Formatii  Nunta, Muzica Nunta,  Formatie de Nunta,Bacau,Botosani,Falticeni,Moldova,Piatra Neamt,Bacau,Suceava,Iasi,Vaslui,Focsani,Adjud,Moinesti,Onesti,Braila,Galati,Tecuci,Ramnicu Sarat,Buzau, Pret Formatie Nunta, Muzicanti Nunta, Lautari Nunta,Solisti,instrumentisti,KARAOKE,DJ BACAU CU SOLISTA,BACAU,CUMETRIE,BOTEZ,video,foto,cameramani,formatie pentru revelion,formatie pentru 8 martie,formatii nunti bacau,formatie pentru restaurante,hoteluri,pensiuni,formatie pentru spectacole,judet Bacau,judet Iasi,judet Vaslui,judet Neamt,judet Vrancea,judet Suceava,judetul Buzau,orasul Focsani,orasul Adjud,orasul Onesti,orasul Moinesti,Piatra Neamt,formatii nunta profesioniste,formatie cumetrie Bacau,avem cel mai nou sistem de sunet Dynacord Xa3,scena de lumini,masina de fum,Masina de bule,Filmari Nunta 2014,Formatie Nunta ,Formatii Nunta,Muzica Nunta,Focsani,Bacau,Iasi,Vaslui,Suceava,Botosani,Buzau,", "title": "Formatia Siminica Bacau - Zaraza - Formatie Nunta Bacau", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T16:40:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EAoL75l8H8", "description": "Recorded on July 30, 2010 using a Flip Video camcorder.", "title": "How to catch Goggle Eyed Perch - FreddyKoenig.com", "publishedDate": "2010-08-03T04:25:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EBo6vfVdAE", "description": "\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Enjoy the video?

The female is slightly larger than the male.\nThe adult male, has a white breast, rufous face, upperparts, flanks and tail and an iridescent orange-red throat patch (gorget). Some males have some green on back and/or crown. The female has green upperparts with some white, some iridescent orange feathers in the center of the throat, and a dark tail with white tips and rufous base. Females and the rare green-backed males are extremely difficult to differentiate from Allen's Hummingbird. This is a typical-sized hummingbird, being a very small bird. It weighs 2--5 g (0.071--0.18 oz), measures 7--9 cm (2.8--3.5 in) long and spans 11 cm (4.3 in) across the wings.[2]\nThey feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendible tongue or catch insects on the wing. These birds require frequent feeding while active during the day and become torpid at night to conserve energy.\nBecause of their small size, they are vulnerable to insect-eating birds and animals.\nTheir breeding habitat is open areas and forest edges in western North America from southern Alaska to California. This bird nests further north than any other hummingbird. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or conifer. The male aggressively defends feeding locations within his territory. The same male may mate with several females.\nThey are migratory, many of them migrating through the Rocky Mountains and nearby lowlands in July and August to take advantage of the wildflower season there. They may stay in one spot for considerable time, in which case the migrants, like breeding birds, often aggressively take over and defend feeding locations. Most winter in wooded areas in the Mexico state of Guerrero, traveling over 2,000 miles by an overland route from its nearest summer home\u2014a prodigious journey for a bird weighing only three or four grams.\nThis is the western hummingbird most likely to stray into eastern North America. There has been an increasing trend for them to migrate east to winter in the eastern United States-(Florida), rather than in Mexico. (They do arrive at the Turks and Caicos Islands.) This trend is the result of increased survival with the provision of artificial feeders in gardens. In the past, individuals that migrated east in error would usually die, but now they often survive. Provided sufficient food and shelter is available, they are surprisingly hardy, able to tolerate temperatures down to at least -20\u00b0C. Most hummingbirds that migrate east are juvenile birds and may occasionally be adult females but are very seldomly adult males. Since juvenile or female are essentially indistinguishable from Allen's Hummingbirds unless they are examined in hand, many of the eastern vagrants are classified as \"Rufous/Allen's Hummingbird\". However, a majority are believed to be from the Rufous species\n\nCrocosmia is a small genus of flowering plants in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the grasslands of Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.\nCrocosmia are commonly known in the United States as coppertips or falling stars, and in the United Kingdom as montbretia. Other names, for hybrids and cultivars, include antholyza, and curtonus. The genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, meaning \"odor\"\nThey can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms.The corms are unusual in forming vertical chains with the youngest at the top and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil [1]. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden.", "title": "Rufous Humming Birds", "publishedDate": "2012-07-31T06:11:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EIJSoLQ5iQ", "description": "", "title": "Great basin spadefoot", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T18:07:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EIoBao-UvI", "description": "River transportation processes", "title": "River transportation processes (EE)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T17:57:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EJmoP3nlR8", "description": "T\u0159apatka je letni\u010dka ke\u0159ovit\u00e9ho vzr\u016fstu vhodn\u00e1 do skupinov\u00fdch v\u00fdsadeb, jako solit\u00e9ra a k \u0159ezu kv\u011bt\u016f.

But as her mother waited for the girl to take her last breath, an image of bright light appeared on a security monitor. Within an hour, the dying girl began a recovery that doctors are at a loss to explain.\n\nBut Colleen Banton, the girl's mother, has an explanation. \"This was an image of an angel,\" she told NBC News in a story reported Tuesday on TODAY. She credited the apparition with saving the life of her daughter Chelsea.\n\nThe incident happened in Charlotte, N.C., Chelsea had been born five weeks prematurely with developmental disabilities and had battled serious health problems all her life. \n\nShe is particularly susceptible to the types of pneumonia infections that had taken her to death's door. Told that there was no hope for Chelsea, Colleen Banton had just instructed doctors to take her daughter off life support and allow nature to take its course when the apparition was seen.\n\nIt would be another two months before Chelsea finally left the hospital to return home, where she is about to celebrate her 15th birthday as well as Christmas. Her mother is convinced that Chelsea was saved by divine intervention.\n\nADG Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Alien-Disclosure-Group/189249627773146\n\nFollow ADG on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ADG_UK", "title": "Caught On Camera: Angel Saves Dying Child In Hospital?", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T22:50:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8E_2dBg7Cq4", "description": "", "title": "Zi6 0156", "publishedDate": "2012-11-13T01:40:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8E_7MZpy0kI", "description": "Gerarda prevostiana (crab-eating snake) eating a crab (likely a Perisesarma eumolpe).

MEGALDON SHARK NEAR MY BOAT!! 2014\nWhale (origin Old English hw\u00e6l from Proto-Germanic *hwalaz) is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacea.[1] The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it excludes dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales). This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale. The other Cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), comprises filter feeders that eat small organisms caught by straining seawater through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen. This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes) on top of the head.\n\nWhales range in size from the blue whale, the largest animal known to have ever existed[2] at 30 m (98 ft) and 180 tonnes (180 long tons; 200 short tons), to pygmy species such as the pygmy sperm whale at 3.5 m (11 ft). Whales inhabit all the world's oceans and number in the millions, with annual population growth rate estimates for various species ranging from 3% to 13%.[3] Whales are long-lived, humpback whales living for up to 77 years, while bowhead whales may live for over a century.\nThe great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large lamniform shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is mainly known for its size, with mature individuals growing up to 6.4 m (21 ft) in length (although reports have been published of great white sharks measuring over 8 m (26 ft),[3] and 3,324 kg (7,328 lb) in weight).[4][5][6][7] This shark reaches its maturity around 15 years of age and was previously believed to have a life span of over 30 years. The true lifespan of great white sharks is far longer; now estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known.[8] Great white sharks can accelerate to speeds that exceed 56 km/h (35 mph).[9]\nThe killer whale (Orcinus orca), also referred to as the orca whale or orca, and less commonly as the blackfish, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. Killer whales as a species have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals like pinnipeds, and even large whales. Killer whales are regarded as apex predators, lacking natural predators.\n\nKiller whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups which are the most stable of any animal species.[5] Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of culture.[6]\n\nMegalodon (/\u02c8m\u025b\u0261\u0259l\u0259d\u0252n/ meg-\u0259-l\u0259-don; meaning \"big tooth\", from Ancient Greek: \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 (megas) \u201cbig, mighty\u201d + \u1f40\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd (odon) (from \u1f40\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (odous) \"tooth\")),[1] is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 28 to 1.5 million years ago, during the Cenozoic Era (late Oligocene to early Pleistocene).", "title": "MEGALODON OR WHALE?

Equation of X Axis- There are two axes , one is x axis which the horizontal line and another is wy axis which sharp perpendicular to the x-axis. In two dimension, coordinate geometry plane, there is only x axis and y axis, and we locate any point by first x coordinate distance and then y coordinate distance. So always x axis represents, the line in which y coordinate is always zero. Wherever we walk, either in positive x-axis or negative a x- axis, the y coordinate is always zero.\nSo, the equation of the x-axis is , y = O.\nThis is very important concept that equation of x axis is  y = o, please keep this concept in mind and remember y coordinate is always 0.\nEquation of straight line is very simple y =o. In the entire x axis ,wherever we go, always the y coordinate is zero. If we take any two points on x axis and find equation using two point formula of straight line, then finally we will get y =o. This is the way to show or prove equation of x axis as y =o.\nEquation of axes is very simple concept in straight line mathematics or coordinate geometry maths.\nI hope this video lesson on equation of x axis was helpful to you in increasing concepts of straight line mathematics.", "title": "Equation of X-Axis", "publishedDate": "2012-05-19T16:56:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EfsuyK99sA", "description": "Chris Jericho is outnumbered against The Wyatt Family.", "title": "Chris Jericho vs. Luke Harper: Raw, Aug. 4, 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T02:38:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Efx4BfeS6g", "description": "", "title": "Palawan Stag Beetle VS Rhinoceros Stag Beetle", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T06:52:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EgAyNXCdtU", "description": "", "title": "The Spendthrift Society Prova Visual", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T20:53:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Eg_EX96Szc", "description": "Twin Atlantic perform Heart and Soul, live and acoustic at Greg James' Festival, G in the Park", "title": "Twin Atlantic: Heart and Soul - Live & Acoustic at G in the Park", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T15:25:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EgprcrQzDk", "description": "El Sicario de Hablando en plata en directo con Arcturus en el aniversario de Muchacalle 2011", "title": "El Sicario - Arcturus (Directo HD)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-08T09:45:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EgrPu38oLc", "description": "Cat Fishing So funny animal.Kedi bal\u0131k yakal\u0131yor.", "title": "Cat Fishing So funny animal.Kedi bal\u0131k yakal\u0131yor.", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T19:49:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EhJjbDfBzM", "description": "No longer, because without cooling system", "title": "Zetec 1,8 Silvertop with GSX-R 750 carbs", "publishedDate": "2011-07-21T14:49:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EhzuzSk2Ok", "description": "LG Washer / Ventless Dryer, Model WM3987HW\n\nThere's a lot of reports that this unit does not dry effectively, and it's completely true.  I purchased this in Dec. 2010, and while it washes beautifully, clothes come out totally wet, even after 3+ hours of drying.\n\nThe video shows a reason why this may be happening.  The solution is working for me, and I hope it does the same for you.\n\nWord of caution though.  The bucket shown in the video holds about 3 gallons, and in a 90 minute dry cycle, I had to dump it out twice.  So what's being suggested here is not a \"set it and forget it\" solution.\n\nI'm planning to get a larger bucket, or container, and also purchase an electric water pump with a power actuator that triggers if the water level gets to a certain point in said bucket / container.\n\nFeb 2012 EDIT:\n\nCalled LG for service, after a few attempts they diagnosed the problem.  They mentioned there's a hose inside the machine that was putting water back into the tub.  Service guy simply zip-tied the hose shut, and this problem's been completely fixed.\n\nHowever, now I'm getting \"DHE\" error code, which is potentially a severe problem.  Called LG for service again, apparently the power module in my machine has some known issues.  Service guy showed me the circuit board, and a component had become warped due to excess heat.  The entire power module's been replaced and machine's working great, despite still getting the occasional \"DHE\" errors.  When this happens, I've just keep the machine turned off for a while to dissipate built-up heat, then re-run the dry cycle.  No issues then.\n\nFinal verdict, it appears these LG ventless all-in-one units (at least mine) are not really ready for prime-time.  I've been encountering one issue after another, and I suspect my machine will finally give up the ghost pretty soon.", "title": "LG Washer / Ventless Dryer WM3987HW Not Drying?

So, what are retained earnings? Retained earnings are the part of a company's total income that is not spent to pay salaries, service debt, pay rent, or pay other costs of operation. What are retained earnings? They are a measure of how much money a company makes and how efficiently it is being run. Thus we want to see lots of retained earnings, right? This depends upon a number of factors relating to just what are retained earnings as seen from a number of viewpoints. When one looks for what is a good investment, one looks for a good return on investment. One views anything that reduces return on investment as a problem. The problem with retained earnings is that they are eventually taxed and may be taxed twice or even three times on their way to the shareholder. Thus many profitable companies end up buying out competitors, buying back stock, and even getting into businesses of which they know little in order to avoid excessive taxation of their retained earnings.\n\nDividend stocks can be very attractive. The investor receives a check every quarter and, in the case of profitable companies, the size of that check may increase every year or so. But, what are retained earnings as regards a dividend stock. The dividends come from retained earnings. When the company pays dividends it also pays taxes on the retained earnings used to pay dividends. The current corporate tax rate is as high as 38%. This is taken from the retained earnings before dividends are paid. Then the shareholder pays taxes on his dividends as well. By the time retained earnings get to the shareholder they are always taxed twice. When the company allows retained earnings to accumulate it may also be subject to another tax. So, what are retained earnings for the tax collector? They are an absolute boon.\n\nIf a corporation allows its retained earnings to get above a quarter million dollars the company may be subject to a 15% retained earnings tax. Add this to the tax on dividends paid and the tax that the share holder pays for collecting dividends and one can see why many companies structure their business operation to avoid accumulating cash. They will typically finance operations with loans and then use earnings to pay off their loans. The interest on a loan is a business expense and will, thus, be deductable from corporate taxes. This is bind that successful companies can get into and food for thought for the smart investor. How does a company address the matter of retained earnings and do they do so cost effectively? Many investors prefer companies that use their earnings to further R&D, buy competitors, and generally expand operations. The company becomes more valuable over time and its stock price goes up. When the shareholder sells stock he will pay long term capital gains on the value of the company as seen in its stock. In learning how to invest one considers return on investment. What are retained earnings from the viewpoint of the long term investor? They are on one hand a sign of a profitable company. They are, on the other hand, evidence of poor management and a possibly diminished return on investment.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EjGEL-O4XY", "title": "What Are Retained Earnings?", "publishedDate": "2011-01-25T19:40:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8EkqWteELTU", "description": "A quick video showing you how to break like a pro, leaving the white in baulk.\n\nIt's simple, just add some right hand side and clip the last red.

The creation of this unique model is the synthesis resulting from the combined perspectives of the two brands.\nEugenio Franzetti, Public Relations Manager of Peugeot Italia, says: \"Peugeot and Castagna have so many values in common that it was inevitable their paths would cross, sooner or later. First of all, tradition: Castagna was established in 1849, Peugeot has over 200 years of history... it is no surprise that we met at a vintage car\nAs a matter of fact, both Brands have a veritable cult of tradition. Peugeot preserves its heritage at the Sochaux Museum (France) and can boast an organization - \"L'Aventure Peugeot\" -- which unites all the Lion's Classic Car Clubs existing globally, including Peugeot Italy's Club Storico.\n\"The past is a continuous source of inspiration for the future;\" adds Eugenio Franzetti \"If we look at the history of our models, it clearly emerges that Peugeot has always pursued innovation and development within its model range, either by manufacturing unique models or by drawing upon independent body stylists, for its sports models like the Dar'l Mats or for series production cars, where the collaboration with the car designer Pininfarina is exemplary. Therefore, it was perhaps an obvious decision to sublimate the intrinsic values of the Peugeot models -- quality finish, attention to detail, real driving enjoyment -- in the production of a unique model that could incorporate the typical values of the Castagna products: development of new materials and their unprecedented mix and match; the warmth, the refinement and the originality of its creations, the scrupulous quality craftsmanship.\"\nCastagna chose the 508 RXH model, the flagship of the range for Peugeot given its generous equipment and it was its \"Allroad\" design that provoked and inspired the coachbuilder from Milan to express his creativity and enhance the premium quality features of this model.\nCurrently, 508 RXH is the highest technological expression of the Peugeot brand. Its innovative HYbrid4 technology allows to mate a 2.0 litre, 163 bhp front diesel engine with a 37 bhp rear electric motor, capable of delivering a maximum power of 200 bhp that can be best exploited, depending upon the circumstances, by selecting one of the four modes foreseen by the drive mode selection knob positioned on the central tunnel.\nYou can select the Auto mode to privilege riding comfort and sustainable mobility, or the Sport mode to maximise performance and available power. However you can also ride in the ZEV mode relying only on the electric motor or use the 4WD to exploit the two powertrains and continuously power the front and rear wheels.\n\"Together with Castagna, we set out from the distinctive features of the 508 RXH and from its HYbrid4 technology to imagine a journey. The journey of a successful man who lives in an urban context but who is also keen to escape for short getaways in the countryside or for short mountain skiing holidays, and travels through these different landscapes in the environmentally - friendly way which a hybrid car allows\" concludes Eugenio Franzetti.\nIt is now the turn of Gioacchino Acampora, Castagna Coachbuilder's chief designer, to reveal his sources of inspiration for this car: \"It is no secret: over the last few years -- and I even wrote it \"back in the day\" - I have stated my admiration for French design and the manner in which the French make products. However, since when I had the opportunity to drive some of the Lion's cars, my actual feelings have surpassed my expectations. Recent prototypes developed by Peugeot like the Onyx concept car, are astonishing due to the use of natural and warm materials, providing a marked contrast to the \"logical\" aspect of the geometrical lines.\nThe underlying idea is simply to allow the spirit of the car to emerge through the use of a single colour. I have often experienced that magical sensation of noiseless drive that this car provides. Sometimes, one would purposely choose a given route just to get lost in the sound of silence: so strong was the desire for \"mimesis\" at a certain point. We drew inspiration from all this to develop a livery that blended the interior to the exterior of the car in a single seamless chromatic tone and this was possible thanks to Lechler and Alcantara.\nhttp://www.carwp.com.br/2014/02/castagna-peugeot-508-rxh-hybrid4-2014.html\nFind us on https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carwp/505636076134244\nDOWNLOAD IMAGES: http://CARWP.com.br\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects", "title": "DRIVING 2014 Castagna Peugeot 508 RXH Hybrid4 on 19\" 2.0 200 hp", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T22:19:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ExdRs2e8ic", "description": "A test to see if you're an idiot...\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/ComedyGamer\n\u25baIf you see this, put 'Clever' in comments\n\nClick To Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=comedyshortsgamer\n \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/comedyshortsgamer\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/comedygamer", "title": "The Idiot Test", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T17:41:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ExiIWvjavY", "description": "Subcribe me!\nFanpage: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fishingsuperstars-clip/718740194855830?ref=hl", "title": "Fishing Superstars - Red Flag Isurus - Jade Wharf", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T05:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Exn13DTXDk", "description": "Test your clumsiness!

More on that following the intro song during which time it might not be a bad idea to check out the focus words!\n\nMany times a day we must put something into something or pull something out of something. Whether it's a key into a lock or a cookie out of a container, things go in and out all day long. Of course, sometimes things don't go quite so smoothly as we see in sample sentence number one:\n\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f.\n(The cork won't come out.)\nThe focus word here is \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c and \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c means to pull out or to extract. The perfective form of \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c is \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c, FYI. Also used in the sentence was \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0430 which means cork, but which can also mean plug.\n\nThe second focus word is \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c and \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c means to insert. FYI, the perfective form of \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c is \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c. You most likely recall that \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447 means key and that \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a means lock. Putting these words into a sentence we derive:\n\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a.\n(She inserted the key into the lock.)\n\nFocus word number three is \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c means to drag or to pull. The perfective form of \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c is \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c, FYI. Also of interest for the sample sentence is \u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430 which means burrow. Putting these words into a sentence we derive:\n\u041c\u044b\u0448\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u044b.\n(The mouse was pulled out of the burrow.)\n\nMoving along we have \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 and \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 is a noun which means extraction. Also appearing in the sample sentence is a form of \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 and \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 means painful.\n\u0418\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0443\u0431\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e. \n(The tooth extraction was painful.)\n\nAnd finally we have \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c and \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c means to put something into something. The perfective form of \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c, BTW, is \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c, FYI. Along with a few other familiar words the following sentence may be constructed:\n\u041e\u043d \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\n(He put a word into the sentence.)\n\nAnd now for a few bonus sentences:\n\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044e \u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a.\n(She inserted a name into the list.)\n\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442.\n(She put the letter into the envelope.)\n\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043a.\n(Insert your name into the first blank.)\n\u0421\u043e\u043a \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432.\n(The juice was extracted from the fruit.)\n\nThe focus words for this lesson include:\n\u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c (to pull out)\n\u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c (to insert)\n\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c (to pull)\n\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (extraction)\n\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c (to put into)", "title": "Speaking Russian 22 - \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c", "publishedDate": "2013-02-03T00:02:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8F0J16I5o1E", "description": "This is not my video, I couldn't find this video on Youtube so I uploaded it.

Her first-year Introduction to Research course exposed her to research methods and hands-on laboratory experiences, which she feels have benefited her in her coursework.  In her sophomore year, she won the Donald C. Gregg Award, which is given for excellence in the study of organic chemistry.  Eva is a subject area tutor in chemistry for the Learning Co-Op and just recently started the chemistry club, ChemCats.  She is part of the Premedical Enhancement Program at UVM (PEP), where she shadows physicians and attends grand rounds.  After graduating in 2014 with a B.S. in chemistry and a minor in psychology, she hopes to attend medical school for her graduate studies.  In her spare time, Eva volunteers at Fletcher Allen Hospital in the Intensive Care Unit and participates in Silks, which is a type of circus art, through the Trapeze School of New York in Boston.\n\nAssociate Professor Matthias Brewer's research focuses on the development of new organic reactions and applications of those reactions to the synthesis of complex organic molecules and natural products. The overarching objective in his research is to develop synthetic methods that facilitate the efficient preparation of complex nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds from trivial starting materials and to apply these methods to the synthesis of both natural products and non-natural medicinal agents.

It typically occurs in the big toe joint. There usually is no history of an injury to an area. One goes to bed, and the attack either occurs while you're sleeping, or you first notice it when you get out of the bed in the morning. Patients describe the pain as so intense that just sheets alone touching it can cause excruciating pain.\n\nSo what is it? How does it occur? Our bodies normally make uric acid when we break down purines. It's normal. Sometimes, however, we make too much uric acid, either through overproduction or under-excretion. Purines are normal in our body. Purines also can occur in some foods. If we get too much purines, our bodies can't handle the amount of uric acid it makes. The uric acid is then converted into urate crystals. Urate crystals are tiny needle-like crystals that get deposited in your joint.\n\nIt typically occurs on your first attack in your big toe joint. On subsequent attacks, it can occur in any joint.\n\nGout is a serious condition, but the good news is, through diet modification and medications, it can be well-controlled.", "title": "How to Recognize Gout Symptoms | Foot Care", "publishedDate": "2013-07-08T02:24:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FIdNzQeqog", "description": "Pour en savoir plus , visitez : www.breville.ca\n Ad\u00e8le Schober de Breville pr\u00e9sente les caract\u00e9ristiquesdu grille pain Smart Toaster\u2122, dot\u00e9 des fentes longues, boutons de contr\u00f4les \u00e9l\u00e9gantes, technologie \u00e0 abaissement automatique,  et compte \u00e0 rebours ACL.\n\nhttp://www.brevilleca.com/smart-toaster.html\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=brevilleca\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brevillecanada\n\nPin us on Pinterest:\nhttp://pinterest.com/brevillecanada/\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/brevillecanada", "title": "Breville\u00ae --Grille Pain Smart Toaster\u2122 en M\u00e9tal Moul\u00e9 BTA830XL", "publishedDate": "2013-10-11T18:00:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FIfej2m7iw", "description": "Inside the Crystal Cathedral is one of the world's LARGEST pipe organs!

Ten\u00eda de cuatro a seis cuernos saliendo de su gola nucal, cuerno sobre su nariz, que media m\u00e1s de 60 cent\u00edmetros de largo y 15 de ancho. \n\nComo otros ceratopsianos, este dinosaurio pudo haber sido a animal de manada, viajando en grandes grupos, seg\u00fan lo sugerido por los osarios fosilizados encontrados. Nombrado por Lawrence Lambe en 1913, el Styracosaurus es un miembro de los Centrosaurinae. Dos especies, albertensis y ovatus, son categorizadas actualmente al g\u00e9nero. Otras especies asignadas a \u00e9l se han incluido desde entonces en otro g\u00e9nero.\n\nTama\u00f1o del styracosaurus:\n\nLos individuos adultos del g\u00e9nero Styracosaurus midieron aproximadamente 6 m de largo y pesaban de las 2,7 toneladas. El cr\u00e1neo era grande y masivo, con un gran morro, con un cuerno en el hocico grande y alto, y una excrecencia parietoesquamosa (gola nucal) coronada con al menos 4 largas espinas. El robusto cuerpo del Styracosaurus recuerda a los de los rinocerontes. Ten\u00eda hombros que pudieron haber sido \u00fatiles en combate intraspecificos. Styracosaurus ten\u00eda una cola relativamente corta. Los paleont\u00f3logos Gregory S. Paul y Per Christiansen del Museo Zool\u00f3gico de la Universidad de Copenhague en Dinamarca propusieron que los ceratopsianos grandes tales como los Styracosaurus pod\u00edan caminar m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente que un elefante, basado en las posibles huellas de los ceratopsianos, el cu\u00e1l no exhibe muestras o signos de exteci\u00f3n de los miembros delanteros.\n\nCuernos y gola nucal:\n\nEl largo cuerno nasal y la gola nucal de los styracosaurus son el m\u00e1s distintivo adorno facial de todos los dinosaurios. Su funci\u00f3n ha sido objeto de debate desde que el primer dinosaurio con cuerno ha sido encontrado. A principios del siglo 20 R. S. Lull propuso que las golas nucales de los cerat\u00f3psidos servi\u00e1n de anclaje a los poderosos m\u00fasculos de las mand\u00edbulas. Posteriormente, noto que los styracosaurus, las espinas le habr\u00edan dado una apariencia espectacular.", "title": "Styracosaurus | ABCsaurio", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T02:54:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUA7c33okA", "description": "EASY METHOD", "title": "HOW TO PUT A CHANNEL TRAILER FOR YOUR CHANNEL", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T19:50:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUBxjWifTY", "description": "", "title": "Degrassi Downtime: Ricardo Hoyos", "publishedDate": "2014-03-29T16:56:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUEBlf3iXI", "description": "For more information please visit http://www.leedsmet.ac.uk Music by http://www.incompetech.com", "title": "PG Diploma Dietetics - Jessica Chadwick", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T15:32:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUUDkwW1l4", "description": "Vaila Chapman, rider for Westbeach UK and APO uk. 1st in the UK for overall womens snowboarding shredding at hillend", "title": "Hillend Sherd On Sunny Days", "publishedDate": "2012-05-07T10:16:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUVrELU_O8", "description": "Pentagon Tactical Soft-Shell Jacket\n\nSoft-shell Fabric Laminated with our Storm-Tex\u00ae 8000 Water-Proof and 3000 Breathable laminated membrane\n\nInner lined with Grid-Tech\u00ae body heat management recessed grid channels", "title": "Pentagon Tactical Soft Shell Jacket", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T17:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "8FUyI9defHI", "description": "Bonne ambiance \u00e0 l'expo Artextures.

Zwiebeln stammen wahrscheinlich von wildwachsenden Arten aus dem Vorderen Orient ab. Die Zwiebel ist zweifellos die \u00e4lteste kultivierte Art der zahlreichen Allium-Arten. Schon etwa 4000 v. Chr. bauten die Chald\u00e4er Zwiebelpflanzen an, und einige \u00e4gyptische Wandmalereien und Fresken zeigen Darstellungen von dieser Nutz- und Heilpflanze. Bei den Griechen und den R\u00f6mern waren Zwiebeln sehr beliebt, und im Mittelalter geh\u00f6rte die Zwiebel zu den Leckerbissen f\u00fcr Feinschmecker. Bis heute ist die Zwiebel ein unentbehrlicher Bestandteil einer jeden guten K\u00fcche geblieben.\n\nIn Europa wurden zahlreiche Sorten gez\u00fcchtet, so findet man bei uns riesige S\u00fc\u00dfzwiebel, Gem\u00fcsezwiebeln und die kleinen Essigzwiebeln, auch als Cornichon bekannt. F\u00fcr die Heilzwecke eignen sich die rohen, rot gef\u00e4rbten, etwas scharfen Schalotten (A. ascalonicum L.) am besten. Sie kommen nirgends wildwachsend vor und sind vermutlich eine Variet\u00e4t der nordafrikanischen Schalotte. Die wassertreibenden Eigenschaften der Zwiebeln wurden bereits in alten Schriften mehrfach erw\u00e4hnt.\n\nFrisch geerntete Zwiebeln enthalten viel Wasser, Kohlenhydrate, Neutralfette, Proteide, Mineralsalze, zahlreiche Spurenelemente, Schwefel, zahlreiche unterschiedliche Vitamine sowie flavonoidhaltige Substanzen. Der stechende Geruch der Zwiebeln r\u00fchrt, wie beim Knoblauch, von einer speziellen Essenz her. Zwiebeln sind wichtige Heilpflanzen, die jedoch bei Verdauungsst\u00f6rungen, Blutungen und Hautleiden nicht verwendet werden sollten. Auch leicht erregbare oder nerv\u00f6se Menschen sollten nur wenig Zwiebeln essen.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Zwiebel\n\nabf\u00fchrend, ableitend, antiseptisch, f\u00f6rdert den Auswurf, blutdrucksenkend, gegen Bronchialerkrankungen, erweichend, harntreibend, hautreizend, herzst\u00e4rkend, gegen H\u00fchneraugen, hustenbek\u00e4mpfend, narbenbildend, gegen Skorbut, stimulierend\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nDie Zwiebel wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet.

They are very different from each other and at the beginning of a relationship, the attraction is almost like, fatal attraction. Scorpio is deep and volcanic, very intense, very pulled inward. And Libra finds this very interesting because Libra is turned on by interesting people. Libra is an air sign, meaning it lives in it's mind and it's fantasy in many ways. Libra is glamorous, elegant, looks for a good life, looks for a lot of attention and enjoys a lot of adoration and this is what Scorpio can provide in spades. \n\nScorpio is an adorer, that's particularly sexually. Scorpio is deeply invested in the act of making love because to Scorpio it isn't just a physical act. It's emotional. It's spiritual. It's a bonding of psyches. And so, Libra is terribly flattered by this because Libra adores being adored. What happens however, is that very shortly the intensity of the sex that they share between the two of them wears thin. It's like, wears thin, at least for the Libra. Libra wants more glamor. Not so much storm and (?) and heavy breathing and emotional demands, and Scorpio is intensely demanding. \n\nScorpio does not want a relationship that's just for fun and certainly doesn't want a light flirtation. Scorpio wants a relationship that is a deep bond forever and ever. And Scorpio is a controller in order to get this and not only in relationships but in it's environment. In other words, setting the rules, living life according it's plan and it's ambitions and it's goals. Scorpio is deeply possessive and deeply domineering. And very quickly, Libra, who is a much more, much more like a butterfly, whether male or female, wants to escape that net. \n\nSo, the relationship tends to devolve very quickly into something that is full of conflict, of Libra trying to get away from this, of Scorpio becoming more and more seething and more and more volcanic, more filled with anger at the, how it perceives Libra to be elusive and not here and Scorpio won't stand for that. So, in general it is wonderful early sex and a wonderful attraction to begin with and then they really should try to part ways as reasonably and quickly as possible because it's only going to lead to deeper and deeper conflict.", "title": "Are Libra & Scorpio Compatible? | Zodiac Love Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-03-07T01:23:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Fh926kxjV4", "description": "\"Satellites\", Track 3 off our new CD - \"Stab In The Dark\".

It was a deserved lead for the home side after both Darren Murphy and Greg Harte had come closest to breaking the deadlock in a scrappy first half not aided by a heavy surface and deteriorating weather conditions.\n\nDarren Murphy added the side's second goal with just eight minutes remaining in the match. Greg Harte's left wing cross was found the City skipper in space in the area and despite his first effort being blocked by the Drogheda 'keeper, Murphy showed persistence to finish the rebound from eight yards and give the home side a deserved win for their endeavours.\n\nNext weekend will see the side travel to Tallaght to take on Shanrock Rovers in defence of their Enda McGuill Cup.

Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: \"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,\" warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"chinatown part 1\",\"chinatown theme\",\"chinatown wild nothing\",\"chinatown soundtrack\",\"chinatown 1974\",\"jack nicholson\",\"faye dunaway\",\"roman polanski\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"deception videos\",\"jj gittes\",\"evelyn mulwray\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/09fb5,/m/0hwbd", "title": "Chinatown (2/9) Movie CLIP - Jake Likes His Nose (1974) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T23:09:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8G0oU5cDFl8", "description": "go eat some plants", "title": "Eating Animals is Doublethink", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T00:47:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8G0voW-5mzQ", "description": "Here, we're basting the knit fabric before committing to solid seaming to check for fit.

The basilica is one of the most important places of Christian pilgrimage in Italy. With its accompanying friary, Sacro Convento, the basilica is a distinctive landmark to those approaching Assisi. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. The basilica, which was begun in 1228, is built into the side of a hill and comprises two churches known as the Upper Church and the Lower Church, and a crypt where the remains of the saint are interred. The interior of the Upper Church is an important early example of the Gothic style in Italy. The Upper and Lower Churches are decorated with frescoes by numerous late medieval painters from the Roman and Tuscan schools, and include works by Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti and possibly Pietro Cavallini. The range and quality of the works gives the basilica a unique importance in demonstrating the development of Italian art of this period. Halfway down the nave one can descend into the crypt via a double stairway. This burial place of St. Francis was found in 1818. His remains had been hidden by Brother Elias to prevent the spread of his relics in medieval Europe. By order of Pope Pius IX a crypt was built under the lower basilica. It was designed by Pasquale Belli with precious marble in neo-classical style. But it was redesigned in bare stone in neo-Romanesque style by Ugo Tarchi between 1925 and 1932. \nThe ancient stone coffin with iron ties is enshrined in an open space above the altar. In 1934 his most faithful brothers were entombed in the corners of the wall around the altar: Brother Rufino, Brother Angelo, Brother Masseo and Brother Leo. At the entrance of the crypt, an urn with the remains of Jacopa dei Settesoli was added to the crypt. This woman of Roman nobility, affectionately referred to as \"Brother Jacoba\", was the most faithful friend and benefactress. \n\nFor more information about travel please visit my blog: http://travel-experiences-of-xandra.blogspot.nl/", "title": "Basilica di San Francesco in Assisi is an important place of Christian pilgrimage in Italy", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T13:22:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8GCLTRAQTgI", "description": "This is a newer video showing how I froth milk with Silvia v3 but use single hole steam tip.

The way you can tell this condition from Mange is the absence of irritation, crusting or rash. There is the hair loss, but that is all. Dermatophytosis is caused by a fungus that attacks the shaft of the hair where it emerges from the skin. Since it attacks the hair and causes it to become brittle, the hair breaks off at the skin line and falls off leaving a bald area, but no obvious skin irritation. This condition is common in late Winter and early Spring. The treatment for it is nutritional support. It's usually not fatal and the squirrel will recover from it over time.

The stages of living between these events: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and senior are themselves natural and in accord with the needs of the species and most individuals. Many find their satisfaction in living this course and to these individuals I have little or nothing to say. Others though long for something more; something innate, genetic and seemingly calling. Adventure and change can give a degree of satisfaction and relief yet even these may seem too tame. To those who feel drawn to something beyond the entertainment and stimulation of senses I offer a walk along The Path of Wildness. Don't bother penciling the event in your schedule, preparing a pack with goodies and supplies or even inviting a friend along, for this experience is along the course of your first inclination and you must surely always go alone.\n\nLearn more about The Path of Wildness here:\nhttp://wp.me/P5A2F-As\n\n====\n\nCHANNEL CREDITS\n\n\"Japanese Falls\" image by the artist Lane Brown.

Name: Blechnum\nFamilie: Blechnaceae\nWuchsh\u00f6he: bis 100 cm\nSchwierigkeit: pflegeleicht bis mittelschwer\nVerwendung: Interessante Blattschmuckpflanze, deren Wedel leicht an Palmbl\u00e4tter erinnern\n\npflegeleicht: F\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger geeignet\nmittelschwer: Erfahrung und durchschnittliche Pflegekenntnisse erforderlich\nanspruchsvoll: Gute Grundkenntnisse der Zimmerpflanzenpflege sind zu empfehlen, diese k\u00f6nnen Sie hier nachlesen: Der gr\u00fcne Daumen\n\nZu der Gattung Blechnum geh\u00f6ren viele unterschiedliche Farne. In dieser Gattung gibt es kleine, kriechende Farne bis zu sehr langsam wachsenden, aufrechten stehenden Pflanzen, die im Laufe der Zeit einen Stamm bilden und damit den echten Baumfarnen sehr \u00e4hnlich sehen. Die f\u00fcr die Zimmerkultur verwendeten Blechnum Farne sind meist tropischen oder subtropischen Ursprungs und gedeihen deshalb sehr gut in warmen R\u00e4umen. Es ist sicherlich als Vorteil anzusehen, das die Farne der Gattung Blechnum auch trockene Luft besser als die meisten anderen Farngattungen vertragen.\n\nBlechnum brasiliense ist in der freien Natur in Brasilien und Peru anzutreffen. Dieser Farn bildet im jungen Stadium eine Rosette aus schweren, lanzenf\u00f6rmigen Wedeln, die gemeinsam einem schwarz-braunen Rhizom entspringen. Nach einigen Jahren der Kultivierung bildet sich ein dunkelbrauner, geschuppter Stamm aus, der eine H\u00f6he von bis zu 50 cm erreichen kann. Der Stamm dieses h\u00fcbschen Farnes ist mit bis zu 90 cm langen und 30 cm breiten Wedeln besetzt. Die einzelnen Wedel wiederum sind in zahlreiche ledrige, paarweise angeordnete Fiederbl\u00e4tter unterteilt. Bei jungen Farnen sind die Fiederbl\u00e4tter leicht bronzefarben, bei \u00e4lteren Pflanzen dunkelgr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbt.\n\nBlechnum crispum ist etwas schwachw\u00fcchsiger als Blechnum brasiliense und hat kleinere, gewellte, in der Jugend meist r\u00f6tlich gef\u00e4rbte Wedel.\n\nBlechnum gibbum wahrscheinlich mit einer der beliebtesten Rippenfarne. Im Wachstum formt Blechnum gibbum eine sehr symmetrische Rosette aus bis zu 95 cm langen und 25 cm breiten Wedeln. Die Wedel entspringen einem geschuppten, schwarzen und bis zu 1 m hohem Stamm. Die Fiederbl\u00e4tter der Wedel sind gl\u00e4nzend gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbt und leicht gebogen.\n\nBlechnum moorei ist ein kleiner Farn aus dieser Gruppe, die Wedel werden nicht gr\u00f6\u00dfer als 30 cm.\n\nBlechnum occidentale bildet kriechende, unterirdische Rhizome. Die leicht nach oben gebogenen, kr\u00e4ftig gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten Wedel dieses Farnes werden bis zu 50 cm lang und 15 cm breit. Die mittlere Rippe der Wedel ist deutlich blasser gef\u00e4rbt als der \u00fcbrige Teil der Pflanze.\nPflege des Blechnum\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Farne der Gattung Blechnum m\u00f6gen gerne einen etwas helleren Standort mit ein wenig morgendlicher Sonneneinstrahlung. Pralle Mittagssonne vertragen diese Farne jedoch nicht.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nHeranwachsende Farne werden reichlich gegossen. Der Ballen muss permanent feucht sein. Nach dem Gie\u00dfen sollte \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiges Wasser aus den Untersetzern entfernt werden, Staun\u00e4sse ist auf jeden Fall zu vermeiden. Falls die Temperaturen unter 13 \u00b0C sinken, gie\u00dft man die Farne nur noch m\u00e4\u00dfig und l\u00e4sst die oberste Erdschicht des Topfballens zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben leicht antrocknen. Die Farne sollten nicht mit Wasser eingespr\u00fcht werden.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Rippenfarne kultiviert man am besten in warmen R\u00e4umen mit Temperaturen bis maximal 24 \u00b0C. Obwohl die Farne vor\u00fcbergehend auch trockene Luft vertragen, sollte man w\u00e4hrend der Hauptwachstumszeit vom Fr\u00fchjahr bis zum Herbst f\u00fcr eine m\u00f6glichst hohe Luftfeuchtigkeit sorgen. In der Wachstumsphase kann man die Farne in wassergef\u00fcllte Schalen auf Kieselsteine stellen. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit im Winter sind tiefere Temperaturen um die 15 \u00b0C ideal. Temperaturen unter 10 \u00b0C sind bei diesen Farnen jedoch zu vermeiden. Generell gilt, je niedriger die Temperatur ist, umso trockener sollte das Substrat der Farne gehalten werden.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nDie Rippenfarne Blechnum brasiliense und Blechnum gibbum werden meist aus Sporen herangezogen. Diese Art der Vermehrung ist schwierig und langwierig. Besser sollte man sich im Handel nach jungen Farnen umsehen. Gelegentlich bilden die Farne dieser beiden Arten jedoch auch Basaltriebe. Diese kann man von der Mutterpflanze abtrennen und in Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe einsetzten. Die jungen Farne werden wie ausgewachsenen Exemplare kultiviert.\n\nBei Blechnum occidentale kann man das unterirdisch wachsende Rhizom zur Vermehrung mit einem scharfen Messer teilen und die Teilst\u00fccke einzeln einpflanzen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nF\u00fcr diese Farne verwendet man herk\u00f6mmliche Blumen- oder Einheitserde. Alternativ benutzt man ein Gemisch aus gleichen Teilen Kompost- und Lauberde. Die Farne werden nur in gr\u00f6\u00dfere Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe umgetopft, wenn die Wurzeln an der Erdoberfl\u00e4che sichtbar werden. Da die Farne etwas saure B\u00f6den bevorzugen, mischt man der Erde etwa 1/3 Torf bei.", "title": "Blechnum Farne, Rippenfarn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T23:38:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8GZqQFHbPEU", "description": "wrote this song today. hope you enjoy it.\n\nLyrics:\nThe sky exchanges colors with your eyes.\nThe blue trades places with the gray.\nAnd it's during that afternoon\nthat I realize\nall the good things never stay the same.\n\nWith you I feel like such a lucky winner,\nbut I'm scared of your hair getting thinner.\nI close my eyes and think about\nhow far we've come\nbut I don't know how far we'll go.\n\nOn the inside, I'm sure we'll never change.\nBut on the outside, we're starting to look strange.\nYou know you'll always be inside my heart\nuntil that fateful day it fails to start.\n\nI want you and I to be together.\nBut I'm scared of my skin becoming leather.\nI close my eyes and think about \nhow far we've come\nbut I don't know how far we'll go.\n\nJust the thought that you and I\nare getting older\nhas me scared of when \nour bodies will get colder\nI close my eyes and think about\nhow far we've come\nbut I don't know how far we'll go.", "title": "Carbon 14 Dating (Original Song)", "publishedDate": "2010-01-22T03:30:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8G_YpI_LLmE", "description": "A junior Science teaching and learning resource. it can be used when students are first learning to light the Bunsen burner or when learning about combustion.", "title": "The Bunsen Burner Song", "publishedDate": "2008-04-21T05:20:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8G_y8zmWNSo", "description": "", "title": "flageolet", "publishedDate": "2012-01-14T23:54:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Ga8OLWiEow", "description": "Highlighting the features and benefits of the MSA G1 SCBA communications. http://msafire.com/breathe/", "title": "MSA G1 SCBA Communications", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T19:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8GaKFODOWaU", "description": "The Impalas invate the bird bath at the camp, and one gets so excited he jumps for joy!
