The Trappists of Koningshoeven have been brewing beer for generations. It all began here, in the old brewery, with the production of the special beers La Trappe Dubbel and La Trappe Tripel.\nAn important ingredient is malt. According to traditional La Trappe recipes, 4 types of malt are mixed, in the correct amounts and composition.\nToday beer brewery De Schaapskooi has an extremely modern brewery, assuring the quality of the beer to be of a constantly high level. But, despite all progress, the beer is still brewed as it was 100 years ago. And thus maintains its original authentic La Trappe character.\nAfter the beer has ripened in the lager tanks for some weeks, it is poured into barrels...\nand into bottles. By adding more yeast and sugar, the beer continues to ferment in the bottle. This brings out the full flavour of La Trappe even more.\n\nThe colourful labels ensure that the Netherlands' only Trappist beer receives all the attention it deserves. The beer lover enjoys his La Trappe at any time, but the Trappists of Koninghoeven usually only enjoy their beer on Sundays and public holidays.\n\u00a9 http//www.faunafilm.nl", "title": "La Trappe brewery - Ora et Labora - Koningshoeven Trappist Ale", "publishedDate": "2011-11-10T13:40:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1aEDAbGOh8Q", "description": "This noisy bird, is used for some families instead the dog, because the bird warns when the burglar get into the patio's house.", "title": "Alcarav\u00e1n Venezolano / Double Striped Thick Knee  / stone-curlew", "publishedDate": "2010-11-05T15:19:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "1aEPbcENTGM", "description": "ein cover von mir vom genialen Song \"Soothsayer\" von Buckethead.(ohne Solo)", "title": "Buckethead`s Soothsayer cover", "publishedDate": "2009-02-16T14:32:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1aEbGydG5L4", "description": "Lil' Bear and Tiger Cub arrive at the Woodland Zoo in Farmington, Pennsylvania.

As the species has undergone both chronic long term and a rapid short-term declines it is listed as a Critically Endangered by IUCN. The gharial is one of three crocodilians native to India, apart from the mugger crocodile and the saltwater crocodile. It is one of the longest of all living crocodilians. Gharials once thrived in all the major river systems of the Indian subcontinent, spanning the rivers of its northern part from the Indus River in Pakistan across the Gangetic floodplain to the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. Today, they are extinct in the Indus River, in the Brahmaputra of Bhutan and Bangladesh and in the Irrawaddy River. Their distribution is now limited to only 2% of their former range. \n\nNational Chambal Sanctuary, also called the National Chambal Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary, is a 5,400 km2 (2,100 sq mi) tri-state protected area in northern India for the critically endangered gharial (small crocodiles), the red-crowned roof turtle and the endangered Ganges river dolphin. Located on the Chambal River near the tripoint of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, it was first declared in Madhya Pradesh in 1978 and now constitutes a long narrow eco-reserve co-administered by the three states. Within the sanctuary the pristine Chambal River cuts through mazes of ravines and hills with many sandy beaches. The sanctuary is protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary is administered by the Department of Forest under the Project Officer with headquarters at Morena, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe Critically endangered Gharial crocodile and the Red-crowned roof turtle live here, and together with the endangered Ganges River Dolphin are the keystone species of the sanctuary. Other large threatened inhabitants of the sanctuary include Muggar crocodile, Smooth-coated Otter, Striped Hyaena and Indian Wolf. Chambal supports 8 of the 26 rare turtle species found in India, including Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle, Three-striped roof turtle and Crowned river turtle. Other reptiles who live here are: Indian flapshell turtle, Soft Shell turtle, Indian roofed turtle, Indian tent turtle and Monitor lizard.\n\nThere are many nature watching opportunities available for the visitors to the National Chambal Sanctuary. The best opportunities for sighting and photography of Gharial and Dolphins can be had by hiring a boat with experienced driver and guide, available at several points along the river. A boat excursion will also offer many good viewpoints for photography of water and shore birds and unique landscapes. Walking trails in the ravines and along the river offer opportunities for close observation of the wide variety of plants and animals in the Sanctuary. There are public vehicle entry points to Chambal Sanctuary at Pinahat, Nandagon Ghat, Sehson and Bharch. Boating and visiting arrangements can be made with the help of the Wildlife Conservator Office, at Kota.\n\nVisitors may explore Ater Fort, a beautiful but dilapidated landmark and historical site near Ater town, 35 km from Bhind. The fort was built by the Bhadauria kings Badan Singh, Maha Singh and Bakhat Singh in 1664-1698. The fort is situated on the banks of the Chambal River and can be reached by bus, jeep or boat.\n\nThere are Forest Rest Houses at Bah and Chakkar Nagar and Public Works Department Inspection Bungalows at Bah and Pinahat. There are several commercial hotels and Eco Lodges at Agra, Etawah and Bah.[3] The nearest airport is at Agra. The nearest railway station is at Agra. Agra and Mathura are major rail junctions with a number of trains from all over the country. Bharatpur, Ranthambhor National Park (with change at Bharatpur), Bandhavgarh National Park (Katni, Umaria) and Kanha National Park (Jabalpur) are all well serviced by the rail network from Agra.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In 1921, it was  introduced in Spain; then from there in Italy during 1920s and later to 60 other countries8 . Beginning in 1908, another larvivorous fish, Poecilia reticulata, a\nnative of South America, was introduced for malaria control into British India and many other countries8  The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a species of freshwater fish, also known commonly, if ambiguously, as simply mosquitofish or by its generic name, Gambusia, or by the common name gambezi. There is also an eastern mosquitofish (G. holbrooki). Mosquitofish are small in comparison to other fish, with females reaching an overall length of 7 centimeters (2.8 in) and males at a length of 4 centimeters (1.6 in). Females can be distinguished from males by their size and a gravid spot at the posterior of their abdomen. The name \"mosquitofish\" was given because the diet of this fish sometimes consists of large amounts of mosquito larvae, relative to body size. Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles, mayflies, caddis flies, mites and other invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up only a small portion of their diet.Mosquitofish were introduced directly into ecosystems in many parts of the world as a biocontrol to lower mosquito populations which in turn negatively affected many other species in each distinct bioregion. Mosquitofish in Australia are classified as a noxious pest and may have exacerbated the mosquito problem in many areas by outcompeting native invertebrate predators of mosquito larvae.Mosquitofish are small, dull grey, with a large abdomen, and have rounded dorsal and caudal fins and an upturned mouth towards the surface.Sexual dimorphism is pronounced; mature females reach a maximum overall length of 7 centimeters (2.8 in), while males reach only 4 centimeters (1.6 in).The mosquitofish is a member of the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes. The genus name Gambusia is derived from the Cuban Spanish term gambusino, meaning \"useless\".The common name, mosquitofish, is derived from their diet, which, under some circumstances, consists of large amounts of mosquito larvae. Classification of the western mosquitofish has been difficult due to their similarity to the eastern mosquitofish, Based on diet, mosquitofish are classified as larvivorous fish. Their diet consists of zooplankton, small insects and insect larvae, and detritus material. Mosquitofish feed on mosquito larvae at all stages of life. Adult females can consume in one day hundreds of mosquito larvae.Mosquitofish were intentionally introduced in many areas with large mosquito populations to decrease the population of mosquitoes by eating the mosquito larvae.There are several disadvantages of using\nlarvivorous fish. Gambusia when stocked in waters outside their native range, often causes serious negative ecological impacts. Gambusia is an opportunistic  predator with a highly variable diet that includes algae, zooplankton, aquatic insects, as well as eggs and young  of fish and amphibians. Gracia-Berthou66 documented  a diet shift from diatoms to cladocerans to adult insect  with the maturation of Gambusia. They are voracious and highly aggressive fish that compete with the native fish very successfully for viable food and space.", "title": "western mosquito-fish (Gambusia affinis) enemy of mosquito Larva Use For mosquito Control", "publishedDate": "2013-10-15T14:58:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1avQqXX8lCw", "description": "\u00c9galement connu sous les titre \"Ack V\u00e4rmeland, du sk\u00f6na\" ou \"V\u00e4rmlandss\u00e5ngen\".

Such a sensitivity is not easily acquired, and design researchers have recommended the use of social theories to guide designers' readings of technology-mediated social experiences. We use philosopher Michel Foucault's theory of identity (and social power, discourse, sexuality, creativity, and style) known as \"the care of the self,\" as a scaffold with which to produce a sensitive interpretation of the intimacy (and ex-pert social creative) practices of adult users of the virtual world Second Life (SL). This reading sheds light on several skilled and creative intimacy practices in SL. It also offers a philosophically grounded hermeneutic strategy for designers interested in analyzing intimate experiences. \n\nDOI:http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2556288.2557127", "title": "The Lonely Raccoon at the Ball:  Designing for Intimacy, Sociability, and Selfhood", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T18:55:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1b6VLKbGYEY", "description": "\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u5317\u5927\u5b78\u7ba1\u6a02\u5718\n99\u5b78\u5e74\u5ea6\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b78\u671f\u671f\u672b\u6210\u679c\u767c\u8868\u6703\u300a\u65c5\u884c\u300b\n\u6f14\u51fa\u6642\u9593\uff1a2011\u5e746\u67081\u65e5\n\u6f14\u51fa\u5730\u9ede\uff1a\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u5317\u5927\u5b78\u570b\u969b\u6703\u8b70\u5ef3\uff08\u65b0\u5317\u5e02\u4e09\u5cfd\u5340\u5b78\u5e9c\u8def151\u865f\uff09", "title": "\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u5317\u5927\u5b78\u7ba1\u6a02\u5718 - Sixth Suite For Band III.

A lot of weight watchers are now adding celery in their diets. This vegetable contains very minimal amount of calories, but is full of healthful benefits. This amazing veggie can help you lose around 7 kilos in just two weeks. \nEven if this vegetable is nutritious, it is not enough to provide your body its needed vitamins and nutrients. For this reason, celery can be consumed as part of your soup and then fruits and lean meat may also be served in limited portion. If you are serious about getting rid of your body fats, then following a somewhat strict diet containing celery soup is the way to go.\nYou find several recipes of soups made out of this unique vegetable. Just adhere to these low-fat meal plans and perform your regular workouts, and you will soon see the difference in your physique. In diets involving soups with celery, sweets and alcoholic beverages must be eliminated. These will impede your weight loss plan. However, you may consume sugar-free coffee and tea. Instead of munching on sweets or fatty snacks, you are encouraged to eat celery soups every time you feel hungry within the day.\nApart from eliminating excess weight in your body, celery is also rich in vitamin C, fiber and minerals such as Potassium and Folacin. This vegetable also has Pthalides, a compound that helps in regulating blood pressure. This is also helpful in treating nervous disorder due to overworking. This vegetable also aids in digestion because it stimulates the production of gastric juice inside your stomach.\nReplacing your heavy meals with soups containing celery is one step to losing weight. You still need to exercise and limit your intake of fatty foods. Fruits, nuts and lean meat may also be included in your diet but only in small quantities. Celery soups will not only help you lose excess fats in your body, but it also helps you gain better health.\n\n\nOther Fat Burning soup diet  videos that may interest you:\n\nhttp://imarkdirect.com/leek-soup-diet\nhttp://imarkdirect.com/today-tonight-soup-diet\nhttp://imarkdirect.com/carrot-soup-diet\nhttp://imarkdirect.com/miso-soup-diet\nhttp://imarkdirect.com/Healthy-Soup-Diet \nhttp://imarkdirect.com/Celery-Soup-Diet", "title": "Celery Soup Diet part of the  Fat Burning Soup Diet", "publishedDate": "2013-09-10T18:24:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bA3VyYoaho", "description": "Light Weight & Big Flow 2 inch Submersible Pump by KOSHIN Japan\n\nKOSHIN is introducing a new line of light duty submersible pump.

Learn more at http://midmark.com.\n\nVideo Transcript:\nThis video is an overview of the daily and weekly maintenance of your autoclave. However always refer to the appropriate technical documentation for the complete list of instructions, safety alerts and sequence of procedures before conducting any service or maintenance operations. \nYour Midmark autoclave will provide many years of trouble-free service if recommendations for periodic maintenance are carefully followed. Recommended maintenance is easy to do and it takes very little time. If the recommended maintenance is not performed mineral deposits and corrosion can build up on the internal components resulting in operational problems, downtime and service fees.\nOne of the most important steps you can take to prevent problems with your autoclave is to ensure that only distilled water, not tap water, is used in your autoclave. Since the autoclave operates with high water temperatures any minerals dissolved in the water will leave mineral deposits. This can prevent valves from opening or closing properly. It can also lead to corrosion in the chamber and tubing. To ensure proper operation and maximum sterilization life, the M9 and M11 provide the operator with maintenance reminders on the display screen. \nThe reminders are removed from the display once a cycle is starting. The exterior of the autoclave should be wiped down each day. Use only quaternary disinfectants to disinfect the unit. Do not use alcohol or bleach based cleaners. The door gasket and door dam gasket should be inspected for damage. When the inspection is complete wipe with a damp cloth. If the autoclave processes instruments that have been lubricated or dipped in dental milk, the autoclave must be drained and refilled with distilled water every day. This prevents other items from being contaminated with the residue from these fluids. It also prevents excessive residue build-up from damaging the unit seals. Every seven days the autoclave will automatically display the \"perform weekly maintenance\" message.\nWeekly maintenance consists of two operations: changing the water in the unit and cleaning. \nAfter disconnecting the upper portion of the water level indicator bend it downward and let the reservoir drain in a suitable container, a bucket, for example. Remove the trays and rack from the autoclave. To remove the tray rack use a screwdriver and pry the tray up, while pulling the tray rack and plate out of the chamber. After removing the trays and rack from the autoclave, clean the trays and the inside of the chamber with distilled water and speed clean or mild soap. Bleaching agents and abrasives can damage metal surfaces and should never be used to clean the autoclave chamber. This includes steel wool, scouring powder, bleach or wire brushes. To install the tray rack and plate back in the unit, insert the tray rack into the tray plate. Press down on the tray rack while sliding it into the chamber. Refill the reservoir with distilled water until the water level indicator is in the green area. The \"perform weekly maintenance\" message will go away during your next sterilization cycle. For more detailed information about maintaining your autoclave, please refer to the M9/M11 installation and operation manual.

Basic info from the size and shape of the image to the details on who took the picture, origins of the image a lot of other information is stored as metadata. This can be extremely useful when logging multiple photos for future use.\n\nHow to Navigate the Metadata\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. To access your image metadata navigate to the top menu bar and click File -- File Info.\u00a0\n2. This will open a new dialogue box with a series of tabs.\n\n1. 3. Description is pretty self-explanatory and can be edited. You can enter the Title, Author, Author Title, Description, Keywords and Copyright info. All of this info is important to fill in if you have to sift through hundreds of photos as a photographer, because you can use things like keywords to find them.\n\n2. 4. The IPTC panels are the metadata standards for the International Press Telecommunications Council. You will use these standards if you are a photographer for the Press.\n\n3. 5. Camera Data will tell you everything you need to know about the technical specs of the photo such as the kind of camera that was used to take a photo, the shutter speed, ISO, f-stop settings, etc. This can be really useful with educating yourself on photograph settings when taking a picture.\n\n4. 6. Video Data is not usually filled in if you are looking at a picture, but if it's an image sequence, then it might give you information.\n\n5. 7. Audio Data is helpful if the picture relates to a music track or album.\n\n6. 8. Mobile SWF would be data if your picture pertained to use for mobile devices.\n\n7. 9. Category helps when organizing your photos into separate groups.\n\n8. 10. Origin helps with the \"when\" and \"where\" the picture was taken.\n\n9. 11. DICOM is the standard for medical and forensic photos.\n\n10. 12. History is an open box with information regarding different manipulations performed on the photo. Whatever has happened to it will show up in this box.\n\n11. 13. Advanced is a series of folders that display data based on different properties of the photo.\n\n12. 14. Raw Data is the raw code of your image.\n\n15. At the bottom, Preferences gives you a couple of other options for making your job faster such as Auto Complete.\n16. Import allows you to bring in previously completed metadata templates but won't be used for the beginner photographer.\n17. Once you are done, click Cancel or OK and you can always reference to this at a later time, as long as you don't choose Cancel.\n\nIf you're just getting started, you won't use this tool very often. But if you decide to pursue a career in photography, this will be a valuable asset to your needs.\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/learn-adobe-photoshop-metadata/", "title": "Learn Adobe Photoshop - Metadata", "publishedDate": "2011-03-05T03:31:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bQ0CD5a9WQ", "description": "Oh what's that?

Their vocal blend, unique and powerful, rivaling any blood-related sibling harmony group, has gained them attention from bluegrass, gospel, and traditional country fans and critics alike, garnering them two Grammy\u00ae nominations, and 13 IBMA awards. Young but seasoned veterans, Dailey and Vincent have built on the experience and knowledge gained from working with Doyle Lawson (Dailey) and John Hartford and Ricky Skaggs (Vincent) to forge their own distinct career path. With 'Brothers of the Highway,' the duo takes a compelling step forward, with original songs, as well as tunes by The Louvin Brothers, George Strait, Vince Gill, and the father of Bluegrass himself, Bill Monroe. 'Brothers of the Highway' is a well crafted, hard driving, and evocative work which plants the Dailey & Vincent flag even deeper into the rich soil of American music.\n\n\nDirected by Matt Butler\nDirector of Photography: Patrick Tohill\nEdited by Matt Butler\n\nhttp://www.daileyandvincent.com", "title": "Dailey & Vincent - \"When I Stop Dreaming\" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T14:40:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bR1F-LqHrg", "description": "Regia di Matteo Chiarello\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/it/album/per-tutti/id815556474\nAcquista su iTunes PER TUTTI, il nuovo album di Riccardo Sinigallia che include PRIMA DI ANDARE VIA, il brano in gara al Festival di Sanremo 2014!", "title": "Riccardo Sinigallia -- Prima Di Andare Via (Videoclip Ufficiale) / SANREMO 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T07:47:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bR8ZjOLe8k", "description": "DENTON, Texas  --  Denton police said a man attempted to rob a pizza restaurant Friday night, but one of the store's employees fought back and then three citizens stepped in to make sure the suspect and his accomplices went to jail.\n\n Ramirez, 41, walked into the Pizza Patron in the 100 block of E.

Although China did have three ancient dynasties: the Xia, Shang and Zhou, Qin's ruler was the first to declare him self an emperor. He united China after centuries of division and ruled over an estimated population of twenty million people. \n\nNow despite its glory, the Qin was a brutal and short-lived dynasty. Emperor Qin's objective was to rule \"all under heaven,\" and he did this through military campaigns and a state philosophy of legalism, or the idea that misbehavior is met with harsh punishment in order to keep the populace in line. \n\nThe original state of Qin was located in the western area of what was China at the time. It was a royal domain allocated for raising horses. It then became one of seven warring states after the ancient Zhou dynasty spilt up. The young king of Qin started his assault of other states in the year 230 BC and by 221 BC had defeated all six, unifying China. \n\nHe then sought to solidify this unification through a unification of culture. Qin unified the currency, weights and measures, Chinese characters and even the width of roads across the whole empire. \n\nBut emperor Qin was not popular among the people, his compulsory public works projects and high taxation put a heavy burden on the populace. The Qin emperor ordered the burning of all books on alternative philosophies than the one used by the Qin government, he then buried alive 460 people who violated this rule. His heavily centralized power structure also angered the nobility who's power was weakened. \n\nIn 210 BC, emperor Qin died, and his successor found himself faced with revolts. In 206 BC, a group of rebels, led by Lieutenant Liu Bang succeeded in toppling the Qin.  Liu Bang established the Han dynasty which would last for four centuries. \n\nAlthough it lasted for only 17 years and inflicted great suffering on the populace, the Qin dynasty left behind a legacy.  The first Great Wall of China was built during the Qin to protect the country from invasions from the north. After the Qin emperor died, he was buried in a massive complex of tombs. In the 1974 Chinese farmers dug up some parts of a terracotta statue, this led to the discovery of 7000 terracotta warriors that had been buried with the emperor to protect him in the afterlife. \n\nBut what is more is that the Qin sewed the seeds of unification and led to later periods of prosperity and stability during the great dynasties that followed. We'll tell you about one of those, the Han dynasty, next time.", "title": "Discovering China - The Qin Dynasty\u2014China's First Dynasty", "publishedDate": "2012-08-14T02:48:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bZ_gAVEEXo", "description": "Come spin the wheel of Misfortune!!!", "title": "BANZAI - The Wheel of Misfortune", "publishedDate": "2008-06-16T01:32:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1bZc094foV4", "description": "Can we reach 500 Likes???

BMW hat zirka 10 x versucht, diese zu beheben, es gelang nicht. BMW Werkstatt Italien sagte: \u201eWir sehen auf dem Computerterminal keinen Fehler, demnach befindet sich das Fahrzeug in einwandfreiem Zustand.\" Seitdem behaupten BMW Italien und BMW M\u00fcnchen gemeinsam: \u201edas Auto ist in Ordnung, das Produkt ist so.\" Bei einer Klage des Halters wurde durch den Gerichtssachverst\u00e4ndigen und BMW Sachverst\u00e4ndigen festgestellt, dass die Probleme existieren. Seither schieben sich BMW Italien und BMW M\u00fcnchen jeweils gegenseitig die Verantwortung zu: Somit hat der Halter dieses Fahrzeugs definitiv keinen Ansprechpartner! Aus diesem Grunde findet die Protestaktion statt, und diese wird nicht die letzte sein! \n\ncontact: onyxmarble@onyxmarble.it\n\nHistory and statement of owner: \nI have the new car BMW M6 (120.000, - \u20ac) bought in 2008 in Italy. The onboard computer of the car signaled the beginning of a transmission failure and other errors. When driving the car, there are various noises, vibrations, rattles, bumps, etc. \nThe car rolls in slow forward movement and then suddenly back, with a loud impact noise and gear shift moves, forward again (very dangerous). \n\nThe BMW repairers thought this was an electronic thing that must be reset and the car will function properly. The electronics have been adjusted several times, the problems were not solved. The car was ten times in the workshop, but the cause has not been resolved to this day. \nThe BMW dealer has rejected a further repair despite the immense engine and transmission damages, on the grounds that they could not repair it, as her BMW computer terminal show no errors and that I should address myself only to BMW Italia. BMW Italia has written to me, for them the car was perfect, as they carry out their repairs of BMW cars with direct access to the computers of the BMW Munich, according to the criteria of BMW's parent company in Munich. For BMW Italia \"product so is\" otherwise \"should act BMW Munich\". \n\n2011, I stopped making payments to the BMW lease and told them they should the transmission losses of the \nVerify cars and take back the car. The leasing company has rejected this offer. You do not accept the engine and transmission losses to date. \n\nBMW Leasing Italia (today) added to my company and added me as a \"credit unworthy non-payers\" in the credit and financial center of the Italian banks register and thus my company and me enormous economic damage. Too, the psychological damage caused by the stress, I had and have are considerable. \n\nMid-2011, I applied for a judicial expert opinions. In July 2012, the courts in Italy BMW leasing Italia, BMW Italia and BMW Munich have testified together, the car was perfect and flawless. \n\nMy detailed letter from July 2012 onwards BMW remained unanswered. \n\nIn judicial expert opinion from February 2013 BMW Italia and BMW Munich have lost. The engine and transmission damages exist. The experts from BMW Italia and BMW Munich have also signed this report. \n\nWhy accepts the BMW engine and transmission damage only by a court? BMW is really designed so technically weak, and not to identify the gear damage their own product in the situation? \n\nAfter all these circumstances BMW has just made \u200b\u200ba non-binding, oral repair proposal. A binding repair not accepted BMW, because BMW does not admit the existing factory error. I expect a complete and plausible explanation of BMW. Who is responsible for my damages at this time? \n\nThe behavior of BMW is not an isolated case, similar to many other BMW M6 customers also happened. \n\nThe contracts of sale of a new car are designed unilaterally: BMW secures all rights therein, the buyers, however they are not. The purchase contracts must be made on the basis of equality, only the customer can be a partner who not only has duties but also rights! \n\nSince BMW still silent and I have no way to get to my right, I see myself \nforced by protests to make the misconduct of public BMW. This is done with the intention to help BMW to be honest, the customers more seriously, to manipulate less and better support. \n\nAs long as BMW arrogant silent and not willing to find a correct bilateral solution to the problems caused by them, I will represent with further protests this issue publicly. \n\nDr. Hadi Pourmohseni I Contact: onyxmarble@onyxmarble.it", "title": "Protestaktion IAA Frankfurt 2013 : BMW M6 demoliert!

Coal cargoes are getting stuck in the middle of the distribution chain as local coal producers are losing clients and facing tough competition from cheaper coal imports.\n\nIn China, the coal market for steam usage is facing a tough challenge, how to get rid of coal inventories starting to pile up when no one buys them away is the first one.\n\nLi Genhai, deputy general manager of Qingdao coal market, says, \"The inventory is really high. From both sellers and buyers' ports to distribution centers and debarkation ports, all of them are filled with coal inventories. \"\n\nThe port of Qinhuangdao is the nearest distribution center for the coal market, and also one of the largest in the country. And what we see proves Mr. Li's words, the inventory revenue has surged since April.\n\nThe staff says normally, the maximum time to keep the coal in inventories is no more than 15 days, but for this round of cargoes, they have stayed there for almost three months now, but still are not able find buyers. The deputy general manager here says it's beyond his expectation.\n\nWang Lubiao, deputy general manager of Qingdao port group, says, \"I have worked here for more than ten years, I've never seen such high inventories stuck in the distribution center. Even if these coal cargoes find their buyers, it would still be a big challenge for railway and water freight services.\"\n\nWhere are the buyers? The problem is that imported coal is much cheaper to get than in the domestic market.\n\nLin Xuejun, coal distributor of Guangzhou Yuehe Energy Co, says,\"We are more interested in imported coal, for budget reasons. Those imported coal products are much cheaper than local ones, and we sell them cheaper, too, so they are bought faster. We have four shipments on schedule, three of them deliver imported coal, only one is going to carry Chinese coal. Until now, only the three carrying imported coal have found buyers.\"\n\nAlthough the Chinese benchmark Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal price index has kept falling for nine weeks in a row, the average price level is still higher than imported coal from countries such as Australia or Indonesia. But until now, Chinese steam coal inventories are still at record highs.", "title": "CHINA'S COAL MARKET FACES OVERSUPPLY", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T12:38:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1cAHXLCqZ4c", "description": "", "title": "UNI Katwijk lampionnenoptocht katwijk aan zee, ligustrum.", "publishedDate": "2011-05-04T19:24:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1cAbshqwbSs", "description": "During Oprah's Soul Series, Oprah asks Mara, whose boyfriend Jonas can see ghosts and auras, if she can also see spiritual visions.

On thing I failed to check (which I always forget to do) is to see if it is easy to get replacement power adapter and usb cable.\nNeedless to say, I've scoured ebay/amazon/.. and elsewhere only to find both power cable and usb adapter being sold only at regular price at most stores.  In fact, there are no generic cables for this tablet.  Arghh.\n\nSo here's what I've gathered:\n\n*** NOTE some people have said staples has the chargers on clearance since they no longer have nook available for sale.  Good luck bargain hunting their....\n\nThe power kit sells for $25 (which includes charger and proprietary USB data cable)\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/power-kit-in-asphalt-for-nook-hd-and-nook-hd/26319354?ean=9780594481904\n\nFry's is currently selling this set for only $19.99:\nhttp://www.frys.com/product/7370334?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG\n\nAs for other accessories, they sell the HDMI connector set for $45 at Barnes and noble.\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/hdtv-adapter-kit-for-nook-hd-and-nook-hd/25468037?ean=9780594451648\n\nThat same hdmi kit is sold at frys for $39.99\nhttp://www.frys.com/product/7722728?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG\n\nThe car charger set is usually $24.99 but is sold at fry's for $19.99 now.\n\nThe proprietary usb cable for the nook hd+ is about $14.99.  I've yet to see this cable sold for cheaper:  \nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/hd-hd-charging-cable-in-asphalt/26252399?ean=9780594481898\n\n*** NOTE 2.  If you wait.. sometimes these charger sets go on sale at Barnes and Noble.  Supposedly, the power kit went on sale for $14.99 + shipping.\n\nGood luck.  I'm thinking twice if I'd get this tablet because of the high cost of replacing accessories or peripherals.  Anyways, it's too late... so I'll just carry around my one charger until it breaks.. or I can find a cheap backup.\n\n** UPDATE:  Target appears to be clearancing nook hd+ accessories.

It is possibly the most voluminous of all the Upanishads. The name literally translates to large-forest-book (brahad -- large, aranyak -- forest book).\n\nThis Upanishad contains six chapters divided into three sections (Kaands):\n\u00b7 Madhu Kaand (Chapters one and two)\n\u00b7 Yagyavalkya Kaand (Chapters three and four)\n\u00b7 Khila Kaand (Chapters five and six)\n\nThe Madhu Kaand explains the teachings of the basic identity of the individual and the Self. This is the section that describes in great detail the sacrificial horse used in the Ashvamedha Yagya.\n\nYagyavalkya Kaand, also known as the Muni Kaand, provides the philosophical justification of the teaching. It is in the form of a dialog between Yagyavalkya and other philosophers. When asked to describe the Divine, Yagyavalkya replies \"neti, neti\" (not this, not that). In other words, human vocabulary is insufficient for an apt description of God. This Kaand also includes a famous dialog between Yagyavalkya and his wife Maitreyi on the Absolute Self.\n\nThe Khila Kaand discusses various methods of upasana (worship), corresponding to the three states to the path of self-realization : shravan (listening to the guru's teachings), manan (reflection on the learned material in order to produce intellectual conviction) and nididyhasana (contemplative meditation).\n\nThe Upanishad concludes by stating the three virtues one should practice: daan (giving), dayaa (compassion) and daman (self-restraint)", "title": "Sacred Chants - Brihadaranyak Upanishad (Chapter Three - Ninth Brahman)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-26T17:46:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ceaIYPDIT8", "description": "\u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u041a\u041e\u041c\u041d\u0410\u0422\u041d\u042b\u0415 \u0426\u0412\u0415\u0422\u042b \u0410\u0420\u0414\u0418\u0417\u0418\u042f\nArdisia flower\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u044b \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435!\n\u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u043e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d: \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0435\u0442 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435, \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435, \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b, \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433, \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e", "title": "\u041a\u041e\u041c\u041d\u0410\u0422\u041d\u042b\u0415 \u0426\u0412\u0415\u0422\u042b: \u0410\u0420\u0414\u0418\u0417\u0418\u042f.

Inflation data for April will be crucial to the course of action the ECB will take.\n\n\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/economy/~3/eatxR4W4qs0/story01.htm\nhttp://www.wochit.com", "title": "No ECB Decisions Yet On Details Of Possible QE, Private Asset Buying Likely", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T23:19:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ci-cGn7hUU", "description": "Take a visual tour through Flagstaff, Arizona and experience the attractions, events and people that make it a Destination For All Seasons.", "title": "Flagstaff Destination Video", "publishedDate": "2008-11-14T17:29:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ciJEua4jtc", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Acute Myeloid Leukemia", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T06:38:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ciLHJJBm4k", "description": "Meet Brad Siefert, Jia Li's biographer. \"So many times we as people see injustice or pain and we have almost no way to connect with or actually aid the situation outside of cutting a check.

Contents Early years: Figueroa was the second of eight siblings born to Jesus Figueroa and Carmen Sanabria in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Both his parents performed in concerts and were also music instructors. Raised in a musically inclined family, it was to no surprise that eventually Figueroa and his brothers and sisters were to become the foundation of one of Puerto Rico's greatest musical dynasties. They received their first music lessons from their parents. By the time Figueroa was 10 years old, he played the piano and his brother Jos\u00e9 played the violin in front of live audiences, performing the sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven. Figueroa and his siblings went to Spain to study music in the Royal Conservatory of Music of Madrid. He studied music and harmony and when he graduated he won two awards, \"Primer Premio en Piano\"(First Prize in Piano) and \"M\u00fasica de C\u00e1mara\"(Chamber Music). The director of the Conservatory invited Figueroa and his brother Jaime (Kachiro) on a musical tour throughout Spain, Portugal and Africa. Needless to say, the brothers took advantage of this opportunity. Figueroa went to Paris after the tour and enrolled in the \"Ecole Normale de Musique\" (Normal School of Music) under the tutorship of Alfred Cortat. Figueroa returned to Puerto Rico in 1940 after entertaining audiences all over Europe. In the island he formed the Brothers Figueroa Quintet. Narciso played the piano, Jose played first violin, Jaime played second violin, Guillermo the viola and Rafael the cello. His sisters, Leonor, Carmelina and Angelina would sometimes participate. During this time, Figueroa was also named professor and director of the piano department of the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico, a position which he held for many years. In 1959, he published \"Canciones de Puerto Rico\" (Songs of Puerto Rico), which contained some his compositions based on the folklore of Puerto Rico. Figueroa is credited with modernizing the Puerto Rican danzas and is therefore known as the \"Father of the Modern Danzas\".", "title": "NARCISO FIGUEROA - Recuerdos De Borinquen", "publishedDate": "2009-08-30T20:21:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1coiQa8GPoY", "description": "Cork 20 International Rally 2014 saw Keith Cronin debut the Citroen DS3 R5 mix it up with the WRC machinery, The event was located in Millstreet Co.Cork.

Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.   \n\n\"clint eastwood\" \"christopher walken\" \"the jersey boys\" \"jersey boys\" \"jersey boys movie\" musical song music \"four seasons\" soundtrack dance biography \"Barry Livingston\" \"vincent piazza\" \"freya tingley\" \"francesca eastwood\" \"steve schirripa\" \"mike doyle\" \"james madio\" \"Tommy Devito\" \"John Lloyd Young\" \"frankie valli\" broadway \"jersey boys clip\" clip scene sherry vchan", "title": "Jersey Boys Movie CLIP - Sherry (2014) - Christopher Walken Musical HD", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T14:47:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1creh__yyAk", "description": "Watch more How to Celebrate Jewish Holidays videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/237556-How-to-Blow-a-Shofar\n\nRosh Hashanah, known as the Jewish New Year, begins the Jewish high holidays, a time of reflection, charity, and new beginnings in the Hebrew calendar. Here's how to celebrate it.\n\n\nStep 1: Start the celebration\nClear your schedule. Rosh Hashanah falls on a different day each year, usually in September. The 2-day celebration starts at sundown the evening before the first full day.\n\nStep 2: Have a family dinner\nStart the holiday with a family dinner on the first night. The meal may include gefilte fish, matzo ball soup, roast chicken or brisket, carrot tzimmes, and pomegranate. Greet everyone by saying L'Shanah Tovah! which in Hebrew means \"For a good year!\" \n\nStep 3: Recite blessings\nLight the candles and say the ritual blessings over them. Recite the kiddush, or blessing over the wine, and the blessing over the challah bread. Pass the challah around for everyone to break off a piece, and dip the bread and slices of apples in honey in the hope that the new year will be sweet.\n\nTip\nThe circular shape of the challah bread represents the cycle of the year and of life. \n\nStep 4: Go to temple\nGo to temple. Most synagogues have an all-day program that includes songs, prayers, readings, sermons, and the story of the binding of Isaac from the Torah. \n\nTip\nOne of the holiday's mitzvot, or commandments, is to hear the \"ram's horn or shofar\":http://www.howcast.com/videos/237556-How-To-Blow-a-Shofar, which serves as a call to examine your behavior.\n\nStep 5: Cast off your sins\nAfter services, follow the rabbi to a flowing body of water for a ritual known as Tashlich. Some Tashlich ceremonies include tossing bits of bread into the water to symbolize letting go of your sins.\n\nStep 6: Enjoy your year\nReflect on the past year and the year to come.

The 11-count federal indictment charges Scarborough with improperly claiming more than $40,000 in \u0082\u0093per diem\u0082\u009d expenses for travel that didn\u0082\u0084t take place.\n\nA lot of the questions about Scarborough's travel expenses were raised after a CBS 6 investigation and after former Assemblyman William Boyland's conviction for similar crimes back in March. \n\nThat's about the same time the FBI raided Scarborough's offices in Albany and New York City as well as his home and a hotel he stayed at in the Albany area.\n\n\"I think both the comptroller and I feel that the public has lost confidence in public officials and that weakens government as a whole and that discourages people from getting engaged,\" Schneiderman said. \"And we're out to restore that confidence and the message is it doesn't matter if you're a powerful official there is one set of rules for everyone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, DiNapoli says this is all about following the money.\n\n\"I don't think this was a case of misunderstanding. You could always look at rules and make them tighter [but] if somebody's going to steal they are going to figure out a way to steal,\" DiNapoli said. \"Our job is to make sure that if somebody does steal that we're on top of it. That they are going to be held accountable.\" \n\nIf convicted Scarborough could spend 37 years behind bars. The allegations come just about a month before Scarborough's run for re-election.

When you go into the trick, you wanna find your optimal balance point on your rear wheel. The front end of the bike should sit pretty level, you don't want to go in too crazy. You're going to use your arms and your elbows along with your knees to kinda pump and maintain that balance  point. If you ride breaks you can also rely on those to help you maintain safety, where looping out where in which one should be going too far backwards, you can kinda tap the breaks to help bring the front end back around. \n\nOther than that you wanna make sure upon exiting the manual you either wanna let the front wheel come down on it's own or kinda hop out of the manual. It's also a great way to link tricks if you're coming out of one trick you can land in a manual, go into something else.

Of course, some components are biodegradable. But other compounds are not, and can do massive damage to our environment.\n\nIn our home, there are toxic chemicals everywhere. Each room has its load of toxic cleaning products. Here are the top 5 toxic household products in our kitchen we should consider replacing by an environmentally-friendly version.\n\nWindow or Glass Cleaners:\nMany glass cleaners contain ammonia, which produces fumes that are highly irritating to eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and should not be used by people with asthma, lung or heart problems. Even worse, combining products that contain chlorine and ammonia can react with each other to form lung-damaging and potentially lethal toxic gases called chloramine. Some window cleaners also contain isopropanol that can irritate mucous membranes in the nose, mouth, eyes and ears. If swallowes, isopropanol can cause drowsiness, unconsciousness and death.\n\nAntibacterial Cleaner:\nAntibacterial cleaners are commonly used in the kitchen. We use them to clean things that come in contact with food (cutting boards, counter tops, etc). Disinfecting what comes in contact with our food help prevent contamination by harmful. However, antibacterial cleaners can cause more harm than good. It may contain ammonia, detergent, lye, cresol and phenol. Those substance are corrosive to tissue, can irritate eyes, and lining of nose, mouth and throat, damage liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and spleen, can cause central nervous system depression, severely affect circulatory system, and are suspected to cause cancer.\n\nDishwashing Detergent:\nThey contain cleaning agents with \"cationic\", \"anionic\", or \"non-ionic\" in their names. These products may irritate skin or make people more sensitive to other chemicals. The main ingredient usually used in these detergents is phosphate. Phosphates are a famous water pollutant. When phosphates are discharged in municipal waste water, they act as a fertilizer, causing overgrowth of algae. Too much aquatic plant life eventually reduces the water's oxygen supply, causing the death of fish and other organisms. Although many U.S. states have outlawed phosphates from laundry detergents and some other cleaners, they are still used in automatic dishwasher detergents.\n\nAll-purpose cleaner:\nAll-purpose cleaners may use many different kinds of ingredients, such as detergents, grease-cutting agents, solvents, and disinfectants. All-purpose cleaners can contain hazardous chemicals such as ammonia (see \"Window of Glass Cleaners\" section above), Ethelyne Glycol Monobuytl Acetate, Sodium Hypochlorite, Trisodium Phosphate. Depending upon the ingredients used, all-purpose cleaners can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. They are highly poisonous if swallowed and can damage heart, kidneys and brain.\n\nOven Cleaners:\nOven cleaners are used to help break up the baked on food stuck to the inside of the oven. The basic ingredient of oven cleaners is lye (either sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide). Lye is extremely corrosive, and can burn your skin and eyes. It is usually fatal if swallowed.\n\nOf course, eliminating all cleaners from our home is a non-sense, however, taking the time to read the labels to find out what is in them, possibly opting for phosphate free versions and avoid the use of oven cleaners with lye, are easy little steps you can take to reduce your family's exposure to toxic household products.", "title": "Paint restorer", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T21:15:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1dNkU6TPFUc", "description": "ZEPA Isla de las Palomas, Regi\u00f3n de Murcia, Espa\u00f1a\nCanon XM1", "title": "Pardela cenicienta (Calonectris diomedea, Cory's Shearwater)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-08T18:06:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1dOhMRgBCns", "description": "http://shaiya-stb.com/\n\nJoin the fun NoW !!!", "title": "Shaiya S.T.B.

Thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in Spain), lute, Baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.[6]\n\nDifferent types of guitars have different sound aesthetics, e.g. different colour-spectrum characteristics (the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the overtones), different response, etc. These differences are due to differences in construction, for example modern Spanish guitars usually use a different bracing (fan-bracing), than was used in earlier guitars (they had ladder-bracing); and a different voicing was used by the luthier. See Classical guitar making for more information.\n\nIt is interesting to note the historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, Spanish nationalist, flamenco, jazz) and the style of \"sound aesthetic\" of the musical instruments used, for example: Robert de Vis\u00e9e played on a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic than the guitars used by Mauro Giuliani and Legnani - they used 19th century guitars. These guitars in turn sound different from the Spanish models used by Segovia, that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as Moreno Torroba.\n\nWhen considering the guitar from a historical perspective, the musical instrument used is just as important as the musical language and style of the particular period. As an example: It is impossible to play a historically informed de Visee or Corbetta (baroque guitarist-composers) on a modern classical guitar. The reason is that the baroque guitar used courses, which are two strings close together (in unison), that are plucked together. This gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation. Additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar (with its strong overtone presence) is very different from modern Spanish-type guitars, as is shown below.\n\nToday's overuse of Torres and post-Torres type Spanish guitars for repertoire of all periods is somewhat critically viewed: Torres and post-Torres style modern guitars (with their fan-bracing and design) have a thick and strong tone, very suitable for Spanish and modern-era repertoire. However, they are considered to emphasize the fundamental too heavily (at the expense of overtone partials) for earlier repertoire (Classical/Romantic: Carulli, Sor, Giuliani, Mertz, ...; Baroque: de Visee, ...; etc.). \"Andres Segovia presented the Spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles\",[7] to the extent, that still today, \"many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar, coming from the modern Segovia tradition\".[8]\n\nInterestingly, while fan-braced Spanish (Torres, post-Torres style) instruments coexisted with traditional central European ladder-braced (19th century style) guitars at the beginning of the 20th century; the central European guitars eventually fell away. Some attribute this to the popularity of Segovia, considering him \"the catalyst for change toward the Spanish design and the so-called 'modern' school in the 1920's and beyond\".[7] The styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars were becoming more and more unfashionable; and e.g. in Germany musicians were in part turning towards folkstyle music (Schrammel-music and the Contraguitar), but this only remained localized in Germany and Austria and was quickly unfashionable again, etc. On the other hand, Segovia was concertizing around the world, popularizing his Spanish guitar, as well as a new style of music in the 1920s: Spanish romantic-modern style, with guitar works by Moreno Torroba, de Falla, etc. Some people consider it to have been this influence of Segovia, which eventually led to the domination of the Spanish instrument - factories all over the world began producing them in large numbers.", "title": "Best Solo ...

His hot-glue gun wielding days have moved forward to a more \"refined\" state, if you can even now call his work refined. The assemblages are a more controlled fiasco of well thought out sculptural organisms.When you enter the gallery the first overpowering thing you see is the assemblage \"Bon Voyage Kinesthesia de Pileon\". The sensory intake incites neurons to overwhelmingly acquire the informational aspects in a form of stunned surprise. A high overload of meaning is mixed with messages on every scale.&nbsp; \"Bon Voyage Kinesthesia de Pieon\", with its placement of objects, isolates a viewer's attention to one point and then leads it to another. The media used is media itself. The piece has objects of desire, food, and one's of fear of senility and age; an old folks port-a-potty, and the list goes on to affront and to amuse the viewer. The message is of the societal farce; we consume, eat, defecate, and at all times delight ourselves in the little pieces of our own happiness. When seen in it's compositional glory, one is uneasy in smiling or taking the thing seriously, either way you feel like you have been politely insulted, and are somewhat happy about the event. In truth there is something to be said about how we process our surroundings. Budd has hit the mark in adding to our sensory graffiti, and the viewer is quite cable of ignoring his message. We take the pieces apart and see them as in offensive, we walk through the smoke machine smoking and the bubble machine blowing and then come up with words such \"a gimmick\" and \"clever\". The fact that you are not insulted is insulting as a whole to how we now perceive our world and at what value we take it. Budd's piece \"Crunked on No Limit\" is the introduction piece at the \"Tortilleria La Popular\". In fact the viewer overlooks the piece due to the borage of information at the center of the gallery floor. The piece reflects Budd's association to his part in the perfume industry. What is Budd saying about the whole of his involvement in society is that we contribute to the world at large. The piece is an elegant display of perfumes on a silver platter; there is no mystery as to why it is representational of the artist. Had it not been for this bit of information about the artist, you might just believe it is more of the same, a piece to overwhelm our olfactory senses in this case, and to some especially in this context, more pollution to innervate our already desensitized selves.&nbsp; Budd does not stand above our own experience in the grotesque, rather admits some of our human relationship to the world we all help create. As at last you begin to soak up the ambivalence and enjoy the show you notice the spheres attached in different locales throughout the gallery, if not being informed of the nature of these \"balls\" you might just ignore them. The piece as a whole or pieces are Budd's \"Wall Moles\". Maybe they do not look the part, but you get the point in that the value of art in perceiving it is not so much the beauty of the marks, rather the perceived value of a statement.&nbsp; All in all, from the unrestrained assemblages to the passively positioned moles, the sarcasm of the work is blunt, and they all challenge you in different ways. The social, to the personal, and the somewhat ridiculous are the perfect unifiers to our experience in the way we perceive, act out, and are acted upon by the world at large.\nVoices of Art Magazine V14.2 www.voamag.com", "title": "Bon Voyage Kinaesthesia De Pileon", "publishedDate": "2007-07-01T21:25:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1dn1YOdz6rQ", "description": "Lambert Wilson, Franck Dubosc, Florence Foresti, Guillaume de Tonquedec...

Some types of fungi, including those found in our environment and others in mold infested indoor environments can cause infections in some people. This is particularly true with people with a weakened immune system.\n\nThe following are some of the more well known fungal diseases and the pathogenic fungi that cause them:\n\nAspergillus is a common fungus that can be found in some indoor and outdoor environments. Aspergillosis is the name of the infection caused by Aspergillus. There are several different kinds of aspergillosis.\n\nBlastomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The fungus lives in moist soil and in association with decomposing organic matter such as wood and leaves. The symptoms of blastomycosis are often similar to flu symptoms.\n\nCandidiasis is a fungal infection caused by yeasts that belong to the genus Candida. There are over 20 species of Candida yeasts that can cause infection in humans, the most common of which is Candida albicans.\n\nCoccidioidomycosis, also called Valley Fever, is an infection caused by the fungus Coccidioides, which lives in the soil of dry, low rainfall areas. It is endemic in many areas of the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central and South America.\n\nCryptococcosis is an infection caused by fungi that belong to the genus Cryptococcus. There are over 30 different species of Cryptococcus, but two species -- Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii cause nearly all cryptococcal infections in humans and animals.\n\nDermatophytes are fungi that cause skin, hair and nail infections. Infections caused by these fungi are also sometimes known as \"ringworm\" or \"tinea.\" There are many different species of dermatophytes that can cause infection in humans. Two of the most common types are Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton tonsurans,\n\nThese are just a few things to know about fungal pathogens and Part 2 of this video series will discuss other common fungal pathogens", "title": "Fungal Pathogens Part 1 of 2 - PuroClean Emergency Property Rescuers Raleigh, NC", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T21:12:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1e2n_o6vY4M", "description": "Hysteroscopy is minimally invasive surgery which is used to diagnose and treat infertility in women.

This is the iPhone 6, the brand new iPhone 6 (not the 6 plus). This is the unlocked T-Mobile version 64 GB space gray model. Let\u2019s get right into this unboxing. I got my handy dandy Andy knife. We\u2019re gonna see what kind of damage we can do to this box so let\u2019s go ahead and slice it open here and we'll see what the iPhone 6 looks like, give it a first look and hands-on with it. And listen to that plastic. Oh yeah sounds great. Love unboxing phones. That's my favorite thing in the world. Alright let's open this box and there we go. We got the new iPhone 6 right there, and we\u2019re gonna pull the little plastic tab to pull it out of the box and there you go. Here's a quick look at the iPhone 6 and we\u2019re gonna go around the phone and just point out the basics. There\u2019s a quick look at the back, got the Apple logo and of course it says iPhone at the bottom. And let\u2019s take a look at the bottom of the phone. Of course we got the headphones jack, the microphone, the lightning connector, and the speakers. And there is the touch ID home button on the front. And there's the vibrate switch and the volume rockers up-and-down, same that hasn\u2019t changed. And the top, the power button is now on the side. So there\u2019s nothing on the top and the power button is on the side along with the SIM card slot. There is the back of the phone and the new camera. As you can see it sticks out just a little bit on this new iPhone 6 so we\u2019ll see how that works out. So let\u2019s go ahead and take the plastic off this. This may be the best part of the unboxing right here. Nice and slow, there we go. Alright now we got the iPhone 6 naked, no plastic and it does look beautiful. The rounded edges are, I like the rounded edges so there's a quick look at the back again. And we're gonna power this up in a second. First let's go over the rest of the contents that are in the iPhone 6 box. It shouldn\u2019t be too much of a difference. Of course we got the quick start guide for the iPhone 6, and we have some more information on the iPhone. And we have the 2 big Apple stickers if you don't have those already. And we got the power adapter along with the lightning to USB cable and the Apple ear buds, which probably won't get used. Probably stay in the box. Alright put that to the side, and we\u2019ll power the iPhone 6 on and get a closer look at it when it's turned on and booted up into iOS. And I\u2019m gonna speed this up just a little bit for the sake of this video. And here is the hello screen. You can set up your iPhone pretty quickly and now we are booted into iOS 8 on the new iPhone 6. And here's a closer look. This is my iPhone 6 compared to my iPhone 5s. And you can see it\u2019s a little bit of a difference, not that much bigger but it's a noticeable difference. And there's the back of it and you can see the iPhone 6 has a newer design on the back. And there is a closer look to see how thin the iPhone 6 is compared to the iPhone 5s which is pretty thin. So that was my quick unboxing of the new iPhone 6.

This device was able to catalyze the conversion of the three main pollutants (unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides) simultaneously.\nAs a general principle, a catalyst allows chemical conversions to desired products to occur more rapidly and at lower temperatures. For this reason, in addition to pollution control, industrial catalysts find use in a wide field, be it the processing of petroleum to produce transportation fuels or the production of chemicals including polymers and pharmaceuticals. Ideally, the catalyst itself is not chemically consumed during this process. Automotive emissions catalytic converters consist of special combinations of precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium dispersed on high surface area carriers which in turn are coated onto the walls of ceramic or metallic monolithic structures. In the modern three-way catalytic converter, uncombusted fuel residues are oxidized with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, nitrogen oxides are converted to ubiquitous nitrogen, and toxic carbon monoxide is oxidized with oxygen to carbon dioxide. Like this, a typical catalytic converter is capable of destroying around 98 percent of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides produced by the car's engine.\nMore info: http://on.basf.com/17Ivn2Y\n\nWe create chemistry.

At least the villagers think so. They don't get any closer to it than neccessary. There are rumors about an entity residing there, harvesting souls and driving people insane. \n\nHowever, there was a time, a happily married couple didn't believe the rumors and just moved into that castle. Month after month passed without any sign of something living there besides them. \n\n\"So it's just a lousy rumor after all, huh?\" Thats what they thought. One day, the woman felt the strange urge to take a walk into the nearby forest. She never did that before. And instead of telling her husband, she only left a letter saying:\n\"I'm in the forest for a walk! I'll be back for dinner, please don't worry about me. I love you~\"\n\nEvening came... Evening passed... Night came...\n\nWorried about his wife, he went into the forest to search for her.\nSearching... shouting.... wandering.... she was nowhere to be found.\n\nNight passed... dawn came... dawn passed... she was gone...\n\nHe tried to follow her footsteps first, but its as if she just vanished all of a sudden. Did someone do something to her?\n\nDriven in pain and sorrow, he gave up the search after 3 days without resting. When he got back at the castle, he soon noticed he wasn't alone anymore. Some ghost Pokemon invaded the castle and started living there. Not having the power to even get confused about that, he dropped into his bed and fell asleep, crying.\n\nHe dreamed about his wife that night. How happy they were... how much fun they had. All his positive memories about her... all the love they shared...\nSuddenly, the dream grew dark. He heard weird noises while seeing nothing. The dream ended with a bizarre vision he immediately forgot after waking up. It was morning already.\n\nStill hoping his wife may come back come, he waited and waited. He became depressive and sorrowful soon. Day for day, he sat on his chair, mourning in pain. That's the time when he suddenly started to hear and see things. He assumed the countless ghost Pokemon around him would play pranks, so he ignored it.\n\nBut... does Pokemon mourn? The voice he's hearing surely mourns... \n\n\"What is this? Why cant they just be silent? Why cant they just stop the torturing?\"\n\nAfter a while, the voices he's hearing became clearer and clearer. He began to remember where he heard it before.... but fear made him shiver.\n\n\"Is it possible? No... It cant be.... is that you, dear?\"\n\nHe wanted to believe.\n\n\"This voice... it must be you... I miss you so much.... why.... why did this happen...?\"\n\nHe didn't got an answer. The noises got louder. Its not only her voice he's hearing anymore. There is something else. Something dark and sinister. In silent moments, the noise got so loud that he could clearly hear it. Its disturbing... \n\n\"What is happening.... what do you want, my dear? Ah... I know... I know...\"\n\nThis day was the last time the villagers saw the Man. He bought a weapon for no particular reason. The villagers were frightened by his looks, so they didn't ask. He looked more dead than alive somehow...\n\nThe next thing one of the villagers heard afterwards was a single gunshot. He called other villagers, got over his fear and entered the castle to see what is going on. But... there was nothing.\n\nNothing was to be found anymore. The castle was empty. No trace of the man, no trace of a ghost Pokemon. Just the sound of the wind, rushing through this old building.\n\nRight when the villagers were about the leave the place, wondering what happened... they heard it. A sinister laughing. Deep and demonic. Everyone of them heard it. They draw back. And right when they were about to leave, they noticed a strange noise coming closer and closer.\n\nThey ran. That was the last time anyone ever took a step into this castle.", "title": "Lavender Town's Ghost Story \u3010Vocal/Acapella Arrangement +Lyrics\u3011", "publishedDate": "2014-03-19T16:33:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eDYNi-55og", "description": "", "title": "TuTo Controler tout les pc d'un meme reseau", "publishedDate": "2013-01-12T23:30:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eE2JUxUIdg", "description": "", "title": "L'ambiance a S\u00e9tif", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T14:43:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eEJ2fgKPyc", "description": "", "title": "Sailor Max on the open seas HD", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T15:14:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eEJbT7a4lo", "description": "Chekkala Bhajana group will usually have 16 or 20 people while performing the art. The artists are dressed in simple most of the times, yet colorful costumes consisting of a dhoti, waist cloth, colored hankie around the neck, garland and flower bracelets on the hands. Apart from that the recognizable stuff they wear include ankle bells. Each dancer carries his own 'chekkalu' with much pride and love! Before starting the play, all these  artists pray by placing all their musical instruments in front of a God's photo, perform pooja and wear the ankle bells and pick up their 'Chekkalu'. Another important part of this pray is that each group member takes the blessing of their troupe 'GURU' (master) by touching his feet. It is nice to see, so much of respect for Teachers here!!!\n\nTroupe members create a circular formation with master being in the center. The master starts with a Bhajan (Devotional Song) along with a music from his wooden pieces by striking them in a rhythm and the rest follow their master in chorus. See the short video that I shot at a Shiva Temple near my native place on a 'Shiva Rathri' night. Sorry for the bad light, I couldn't capture it any better. This is just to give you a flavor of how the art being performed\nExpert artists would have a good understanding of about 100 different steps (variations in their foot and body movement) in this form of art. But most of the current existing troupes hardly know a dozen at the max. Master in the middle keeps singing while guiding and facilitating  narration of episodes from Epics and Puranas. Rest of the group jump and dance according to the steps as the master directs.

European Assault was released for GameCube in January 2005, and PlayStation 2, Xbox in June 2005. The game's story was written by John Milius, the writer of Apocalypse Now. The plot is based on Lieutenant William Holt, an operative in the Office of Strategic Services, and follows his deployments to allied forces in France, North Africa, the Soviet Union and Belgium.\nMedal of Honor: European Assault was formerly titled Medal of Honor: Dogs of War, however, this was changed due to the implied connotation of mercenaries.

The Puget Sound Garter Snake (T. s. pickeringi) is found on Vancouver Island and in the lower mainland.  The Valley Garter Snake (T. s. fitchi) is found across most of southern B.C. and along the northern coast almost to the Yukon.  Finally, the Red-sided Garter Snake (T. s. parietalis) occurs in eastern B.C. towards the prairie provinces.\nIf captured, a Common Garter Snake will try to escape by releasing a smelly mix of musk and feces from its vent (opening to the digestive and reproductive tract at the base of the tail). \nCommon Garter Snakes are live-bearing, meaning their young grow inside them until fully developed.  The young are born live sometime in July or August.   Females usually have between 10 and 15 young per litter, but they can have as many as 70 to 80 (that's a tummy full!) or as few as 5. \nThe Common Garter Snake is the most widespread snake in Canada.

The term is derived from an Arabic word meaning to 'call out' or to 'summon', and Muslims regard this as a profound act of worship. This is when Muslim people from all over connect with God and ask him for forgiveness and favors. The Islamic prophet Muhammad is reported to have said \"Dua is the very essence of worship,\" while one of God's commands expressed through the Qur'an is for them to call out to Him:\n\n    And your Lord says: \"Call on Me; I will answer your (Prayer)!\"\n    \u2014 Qur'an, sura 40 (Ghafir), ayat 60[2]\n\nThere is a special emphasis on du'a in Muslim spirituality and early Muslims took great care to record the supplications of Muhammad and transmit them to subsequent generations.[citation needed] These traditions precipitated new genres of literature in which prophetic supplications were gathered together in single volumes that were memorized and taught. Collections such as Imam al-Nawawi's Kitab al-adhkar and Shams al-Din al-Jazari's al-Hisn al-Hasin exemplify this literary trend and gained significant currency among Muslim devotees keen to learn how Muhammad supplicated to God.\n\n\nImam Zain ul Abideen's Dua\n\nZayn al-Abidin conveyed his understanding of the relationship between human and God by the prayers and supplications that he offered God during his extensive nighttime vigils in the mosque of Muhammad in Medina. These prayers and supplications were written down and then disseminated by his sons and the subsequent generations. Among them is the Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, which is known as the Psalms\n\"  An extract of Dua Abu Hamza al-Thumali by Zayn al-Abidin:\n\nAll Praise is for Allah who treats me with clemency, just as if I have no sin. So my Lord is the most praised by me of all, and most worthy of my praise. O' Allah! I find the roads of wishes to You wide open, And the rivers of hope to You vast and running, And counting on Your bountifulness (in times of need) for those who wished You freely accessible, And the gates of prayer to those who are disparate, wide ajar, And I know that You are for those who ask You in the position of answer, And for those who are distressed, You are in a posture of rescue.[1]\n\n\nTawassul\n\nThe term Tawassul means the seeking of God's help and response through something beloved to Him.\n\nThere are many ways of performing Tawassul, as mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, one may make mention of the names and attributes of God (See 99 Names of Allah) or a good deed one has done, a blessed time such as Ramadhan. One could also ask someone alive to make du'a to God on one's behalf.\n\nPatience\n\nIn Islam, to be hasty in du'a is said to be a cause of rejection of du'a. The concept of hastiness is described in the following hadith.\n\nIt was asked, \"O Messenger of God?...What does it mean to be hasty?\" Prophet Muhammad responded \"A worshipper says, 'I have prayed and prayed , and I don't yet see that it will be accepted; so he gives up hope of being answered, and leaves du'a'.[9]\n\nBasically this means that a person makes du'a and it does not get answered right away so a person gives up and stops asking for it. The type of hastiness that is forbidden in Islam is that a person leaves du'a, thinking that God will not respond to it. In Islam, Muslims are instructed to not give up du'a because they do not see a response immediately. This can be supported by verses in the Quran and Hadiths. In Surah Al-Anbiya Verse 19 it says:\n\nUnto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; [10]\n\nMuhammad is reported to have said: \"You will be responded to as long as you are not hasty (meaning that you give up du'a)\"[11]\n\nThe word hasty is used because it means that a person is hasty in expecting a response.\nPurity\n\nIn Islam, in order for a person's du'a to be accepted by God, it must be for something pure and good.", "title": "Dua Allahumma Kunle Waliek   Dua e Imam Zaman Ajf   HadiTV", "publishedDate": "2012-07-07T18:44:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eMLMw_WYRE", "description": "air-to-air CH j.2A &gt; adj.B &gt; 5A &gt; j.2A &gt; dj.2C&gt; 5A &gt; j.2A &gt; dj.2C &gt; 5A&gt; 5B &gt; j.B &gt; j.2A &gt; dj.2C &gt; Agito", "title": "Hakumen Air-to-Air CH j.2A Combo 1", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05T23:23:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1eMq-MTw2wA", "description": "They leave their communities and loved ones behind for a better life in the United States.
