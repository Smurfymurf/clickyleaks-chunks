Tiene el tronco recto, irregular y corteza estriada, gris\u00e1cea.\n\nBrota abundantemente de ra\u00edz, dando bosques y bosquetes de gran densidad.\n\nSus hojas son lobuladas, con los entrantes muy marcados llegando casi hasta el nervio. Color verde por el haz y con pelos en el env\u00e9s. El peciolo es corto.\n\nEl fruto es la bellota, cuya c\u00fapula llega hasta 1/3 del fruto y tiene el ped\u00fanculo muy corto. Maduran en oto\u00f1o y, al  igual que la encina y el quejigo, son f\u00e1ciles de hacer germinar. Para sembralas basta con enterrarlas entre 2 y 4 cm en la tierra o sustrato, en posici\u00f3n tumbada. Cuanto antes se siembren desde la recogida de la semilla mejor porque van perdiendo viabilidad y su conservaci\u00f3n por estratificaci\u00f3n es delicada. Para saber si son viables basta echarlas en agua y descartar las que floten. Se pueden sembrar en su sitio definitivo (inconveniente: se la pueden comer los ratones, jabal\u00edes, etc) o en contendor (alveolo forestal preferentemente) y luego transplantar.\n\nEl rebollo es muy resistente al fr\u00edo y prefiere sustratos \u00e1cidos. Sustituye a la encina en altura y necesita m\u00e1s humedad.\n\nSe usa mucho para le\u00f1a y tambi\u00e9n se ha utilizado para hacer carb\u00f3n.\n\nM\u00e1s sobre el rebollo o melojo (Quercus pyrenaica) en: http://riomoros.blogspot.com/2011/03/el-rebollo-quercus-pyrenaica.html", "title": "EL REBOLLO: Quercus pyrenaica (http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es/)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-24T10:56:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QfDyu5p0ko", "description": "Her grab evades more than people expect.

He is accused of calling for the swearing in of Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on the 7th of July. Aladwa was arrested at midday for his alleged remarks calling for the swearing in of CORD leader Raila Odinga as president. This comes as the government is taking stringent measures on remarks that constitute hatespeech. The ODM team has however distanced itself from Aladwa's remarks with acting party leader Anyang Nyong' saying that it is not the official position of the ODM party. Aladwa on the other hand insists that he is the party leader since delegates elected him. It has not yet been confirmed what charges Aladwa will be facing.\n\n\nFor more news visit http://www.ntv.co.ke\nFollow us on Twitter http://www.twitter.com/ntvkenya\nLike our FaceBook page http://www.facebook.com/NtvKenya", "title": "George Aladwa in police custody for allegedly calling for swearing in of Raila as president", "publishedDate": "2014-06-21T18:48:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QheT3-fMjI", "description": "ENTHUSIASTIC P (prod by HELLASAURUS)\nwww.enthusiasticp.com\nbooking@enthusiasticp.com\n\n2014\nDEFF COAST MUSIC\nwww.facebook.com/deffcoast", "title": "ENTHUSIASTIC P - IMPOSSIBLE TOP SCORE", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T07:04:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Qi-Y6yCW14", "description": "StraySperm (\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0438\u0434) - \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u043b\u044f Windows Phone, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439, \u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u043b\u044e\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445.\n\n\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0445, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d.\n\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 - http://wpand.net/2012/06/16/straysperm-spermatozoid-igra-dlya-wp/\n\u041f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c http://twitter.com/wpandnet", "title": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f Windows Phone | StraySperm - WPand.net", "publishedDate": "2012-06-16T08:14:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QiRoO8af7s", "description": "Punctuated Equilibrium.

We have received a task to expose those who plan to jolt the security and revolt against the ruler. We have heard of a Fatw\u00e2 that says that it is not allowed to follow and fight against these people because they fight for the sake of All\u00e2h and (they) want to drive out the disbelievers who fight against the Muslims in other countries, such as Iraq. Which opinion is the correct one in this matter?\n\nShaykh al-Fawz\u00e2n: May All\u00e2h aid you! You are in Jih\u00e2d when performing this deed [I.e. exposing those in question]. Your intention is to hit back at the people of falsehood and preserve the security, life, honour, and property. You are in Jih\u00e2d. May All\u00e2h aid you and reward you with the reward of the Muj\u00e2hid\u00fbn. You are likewise obeying the ruler of the Muslims. The deed you are performing is very noble. Therefore, do not doubt.\n\nAs for those who are saying that this is Jih\u00e2d; whom are they? Have any of the recognized scholars said that this is Jih\u00e2d? Never! This is a lie. The fact of the matter is that this deed involves declaring Muslim blood lawful to spill and making rebellion against the ruler. All of this is disobedience and great sins and refuge is sought with All\u00e2h. Thus, this does not belong to Jih\u00e2d. This is for the sake of Shayt\u00e2n (Satan) and not for the sake of All\u00e2h. It harms the Muslims.\n\nRegarding expelling disbelievers, then this is not up to you (those in question). The one who drives out the disbelievers is the ruler. He is the one who grants them security, lets them enter the country due to those advantages the Muslims are in need of. He expels them when their time has expired. The prophet (sall\u00e2 All\u00e2hu 'alayhi wa sallam) said:\n\n\"Expel the polytheists from the Arabian peninsula.\"\n\n(al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee 2888 and Muslim 1637)\n\nThis address is directed towards the rulers. 'Umar (radhiya All\u00e2hu 'anh) was thusly the first one to expel them. The other citizens did not do it. The one who expels the disbelievers and brings them in is the ruler. They did not come as soldiers. They came in order to carry out work in diplomacy or business. The Muslims brought them for their own benefit. They received security and pact when they entered. The prophet (sall\u00e2 All\u00e2hu 'alayhi wa sallam) said:\n\n\"The one who kills a disbeliever who has received a pact (Mu'\u00e2had) will not be able to smell the fragrance of Paradise, and its fragrance extends (to the distance of) seventy years.\"\n\n(al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee 3166)\n\nThis is a harsh threat.\n\nThe one who says that it is Jih\u00e2d is either knowledgeable in deviance, if he possesses knowledge, or he is also really ignorant without knowing what Jih\u00e2d for All\u00e2h's sake is.", "title": "War Against The Terrorists is From Jih\u00e2d! | Shaykh al-Fawz\u00e2n", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T21:09:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QmBZrGjipU", "description": "dog sleep bed", "title": "pipage the jack 2", "publishedDate": "2009-12-09T18:47:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QmEwMlw3O8", "description": "How can we learn of what are made the stars and galaxies?", "title": "spectroscopy for astronomy", "publishedDate": "2012-12-21T19:42:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QmO5jTnfNk", "description": "ECM Chancel Choir \nJuly 14, 2013 \nConductress: Alian Cruz \nPianist: Nemuel Soriano", "title": "Proclamation of Service -ECM Chancel Choir", "publishedDate": "2013-07-14T05:09:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QmZ2vvCqb0", "description": "1401m3 new world record 40m high flames started with a rocket", "title": "GUINNESS WORLDS BIGGEST BONFIRE", "publishedDate": "2007-02-21T17:21:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Qmh4tJgvWU", "description": "The only way to study the movements of Swifts is in SlowMotion, Our brains are to slow to see what happens in real time.\n(Apus Apus)\nDe enige manier om de vliegbewegingen van gierzwaluwen te bestuderen is in SlowMotion.

The red arrow represents load (to be raised or descended) applied to the gear.\nThe yellow ratchet wheel with a female cone rotates idly. It is connected to the violet crank by the white ring and two red springs. The crank makes a helical joint with the orange shaft.\nThe video shows three stages for the load: \n1. Moving up: The crank is turned clockwise (the blue arrow). Due to the helical joint the crank presses the ratchet wheel towards the blue gear to close the cone clutch, hence the gear rotates to move up the load. The crank, the ratchet wheel, the gear and the orange shaft rotate together.\n2. Stop (no force applied to the crank): The load tends to turn the blue disk anticlockwise but the springs maintain the press from the crank, hence the closing state of the clutch is continued. The pawl brakes the load from descending.\n3. Moving down:  The crank is pushed (not turned) anticlockwise (the pink arrow). Due to the helical joint the crank moves a little to the right to disclose the cone clutch, hence the gear can rotates to move down the load. If the crank is released, the springs pull the crank to close the clutch to brake the load.\nThus the crank does not rotate during descending the load to avoid accidents.\nThe key factor is the right hand thread of the orange shaft in this case.", "title": "Safety crank for windlass", "publishedDate": "2013-10-22T01:26:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6QsSVMAtn5w", "description": "How to draw a cute cartoon hippo in less than 2 min!

To enable this, the injection pressure build-up is separated from the injection process.\nA high-pressure pump generates the necessary fuel pressure, which is stored in a high-pressure accumulator (the rail) from where it is available to all injectors at all times. These injectors have extremely fast solenoid valves that are actuated electronically. This results in a great amount of flexibility in designing the injection process. At MAN, up to 3 partial injections are currently used per work cycle. As a result, a freely selectable common rail system pressure can be produced for all cylinders across the entire operating speed range of the engine.\nAn optimised injection process with ideal atomisation under high injection pressure can thus be achieved even at low engine speeds. For design reasons, this freely selectable build-up of system pressure is not possible for cam-controlled systems such as pump nozzle (PN) and unit pump system (UPS). The pressure level for these systems fluctuates depending on the load and engine speed. The largely free configuration of the injection parameters, as enabled by the common rail system, is not possible in this case.", "title": "Function of the common rail fuel injection system", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17T13:00:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6R0fAp3QJvc", "description": "Steps:\n\n1 - Heat up the water in the stove.\nMake sure the water does NOT boil.

Have you secretly yearned for an authentic Western, Earth-based, shamanic, spiritual practice but you have been dissapointed with some of the New Age religions? The Thunder Wizard Path is a modern shamanic practice derived from spiritual principles contained in the Mythological lore of the pre-Christian Teutonic people of northern Europe. Embedded within the Norse myths are coded instructions for absorbing universal life force energy (qigong), shamanism and spiritual transformation. Author Michael William Denney has spent 20 years researching and decoding spiritual secrets contained within the mythologies of India and China. In The Thunder Wizard Path, Mr. Denney takes his understanding of these sacred teachings and applies it to the myths of his ancestors - the Teutons.

The females go around in groups, while the males travel the area on their own. The females will only mate with a dominant male and he will chase away all other enthusiasts.\nKangaroo births seem a non stop business. When the young - or joey - is only four months old the female mates again. The remarkable thing is that the foetus will only develop when the pouch is empty, so when the young can more or less stand on his own two feet.\nFemales mate for the first time when they are 18 months old. The gestation period lasts 33 to 38 days. After birth the young will use its mothers pouch as a safe hiding place for about 11 months.\nBroadcast format available at: http://www.stockshot.nl/", "title": "eastern grey kangaroo - macropus giganteus", "publishedDate": "2009-07-21T13:38:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RDrzzak-j4", "description": "bjp leader rahul sinha says free and fair panchayat poll is not possible unless it is done under the supervision of central forces.", "title": "rahul sinha on panchayet vote", "publishedDate": "2013-04-06T13:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RDxFJk2MV8", "description": "Rhodophyta", "title": "Ciclo de Vida de Rhodophyta", "publishedDate": "2013-06-23T15:42:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RDzOocjC0U", "description": "Is that vine covering your banks and trees a valued native plant or the dreaded poison ivy?

Bentley Flying Spur Options include a remote-controlled rear-seat entertainment system embedded in the front row headrests. Lambswool rugs accompany the Bentley Flying Spur Premium specification.\nOn 12 February 2013, Bentley Motors announced a redesigned Flying Spur for model-year 2014.[1] The 2014 Bentley Flying Spur was first unveiled to the public at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.[2] The \"Continental\" prefix has been omitted from Bentley's promotional material for this model. Bentley Flying Spur carries the same twin-turbo 6.0-litre W12 used in the Continental GT, for an output of 616 horsepower, 590 pound-feet of torque and zero-to-sixty-mph time of 4.3 seconds. The Bentley Flying Spur sedan weighs 5,451 pounds and has a new eight-speed automatic transmission for the 2014 Bentley Flying Spur model-year. Bentley Flying Spur's all-wheel-drive system is rear-biased with a ratio of 60:40.\n\nThe 2014 Bentley Flying Spur MPG is expected to get better fuel economy by U.S. EPA estimates, with (uncertified) projections of 12 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city and 20 mpg on the highway.\nThe Bentley Continental Flying Spur is a four-door variant of the Bentley Continental GT coup\u00e9. The Bentley Flying Spur was introduced in 2005. This car shares its platform with the Volkswagen Phaeton, and its powertrain components are related to those on the Audi A8 and S8. It was designed by the same team as produced the Continental GT and Continental GTC.\nBentley Flying Spur Changes include increasing engine performance (from Continental GT Speed), ZF eight-speed transmission, redesigned body with lower, wider appearance with sharp lines and gently curvaceous surfaces; new wing vent at front fenders, new body structure includes reinforcement to the B-posts, sills and front crossmembers together with deformable components in the floorpan for optimal load transfer; a deployable aluminium bonnet that includes both new reinforcement panels and deformation elements, 600 new interior parts, lightweight acoustic underfloor panels, side glazing and both front and rear screens made in acoustic glass, heating and ventilation system with a new Thermostatic Expansion Valve (with optional Climate Boost function), new 19\" tyre with 12% relative increase in sidewall height, Bentley Flying Spur suspension spring rates are softened front and rear by 10% and 13% respectively, anti-roll bars softened by 13 per cent and 15 per cent to improve single wheel impact absorption, suspension lever bushes all-round softened by at least 25 per cent for reduced road surface-induced noise and vibration, revised damper electronic control (CDC), new 19-inch Classic wheel in bright-painted or with a diamond turned finish (optional 20-inch five-spoke, 21-inch six-spoke and 21-inch ten-spoke wheels).\n\nBentley Flying Spur W12 Mulliner includes five additional hides, expanding the number of available shades to 17, five further wood veneers choices, 21-inch five-spoke two-piece alloy wheels, Mulliner name at treadplates and the chrome details on the wing vent, diamond-quilted seats and door panels with perforated hides, drilled alloy sports pedals and a knurled sports gear lever.\n\nThe \"Continental\" prefix has been omitted from Bentley's promotional material for this facelift model. According to Bentley's designers, this was a conscious attempt to distance the Flying Spur - a 4-door limousine - from the 2-door Continental GT range[28] (historically, the Continental name was generally used by Bentley to refer to 2-door models). \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_Continental_Flying_Spur_%282005%29#Flying_Spur", "title": "Bentley Flying Spur DRIVING 2014 Damson Rose HD Bentley Commercial CARJAM TV Bentley Continental", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T09:45:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RTO17oVma4", "description": "Explore and enter a world of poetic experiences and jungle-clad romance in a place that cloaks you with luxury.

Leave the mask on for 15-20 minutes. \n\nThis mask uses coenzyme Q10 and high performance hydration to prevent fine lines, moisturize and improve elasticity and clarity. It's great for tired eyes after a long work week. It's also good for when you haven't been able to get in enough sleep.\n\nAfter you remove the mask, there's no need for post cleansing.

His son, Kevin Kraut shares what else Ogden learned in the video.\n\nThis is recounted by Le Roi Clarence Snow, son of Lorenzo Snow.\n\nFor some time President Woodruff's health had been failing. Nearly every evening President Lorenzo Snow visited him at his home on South 5th East Street. This particular evening the doctors said President Woodruff was failing rapidly and they feared he would not live much longer. Lorenzo Snow was then President of the Council of Twelve and was greatly worried over the possibility of succeeding President Woodruff, especially because of the terrible financial condition of the Church. Referring to this, President Heber J. Grant had said: \"The Church was in a financial slough of despond, so to speak, almost financially bankrupt\u2014its credit was hardly good for a thousand dollars without security.\"\n\nMy father went to his room in the Salt Lake Temple, where he was residing at the time. He dressed in his robes of the Priesthood, went into the Holy of Holies, and knelt at the sacred altar. He plead with the Lord to spare President Woodruff's life, that he might outlive him and that the great responsibility of Church leadership would never fall upon his shoulders. Yet he promised the Lord that he would devotedly perform any duty required at his hands. At this time he was in his eighty-sixth year.\n\nSoon after this President Woodruff was taken to California, where he died Friday morning at 6:40 a.m., September 2, 1898. President George Q. Cannon at once wired the sad information to the President's office in Salt Lake City. Word was forwarded to President Snow who was in Brigham City. The telegram was delivered to him on the street in Brigham. He read it to President Rudger Clawson, then president of the Box Elder Stake, who was with him, went to the telegraph office and replied that he would leave on the train about 5:30 p.m., he then went to his private room in the Salt Lake Temple, put on his holy temple robes, repaired again to the same sacred altar, offered up the signs of the Priesthood; and poured out his heart to the Lord. He prayed, \"Thy will be done. I have not sought this responsibility but if it be Thy will, I now present myself before Thee for Thy guidance and instruction. I ask that Thou show me what Thou wouldst have me do.\"\n\nAfter finishing his prayer he expected a reply, some special manifestation from the Lord. So he waited\u2014and waited\u2014and waited. There was no reply, no voice, no visitation, no manifestation. He left the altar and the room in great disappointment. He passed through the Celestial room and into the large corridor leading to his own room where a most glorious manifestation was given President Snow. One of the most beautiful accounts of this experience is told by his granddaughter, Allie Young Pond.\n\n\"One evening when I was visiting Grandpa Snow in his room in the Salt Lake Temple, I remained until the doorkeepers had gone and the nightwatchman had not yet come in, so grandpa said he would take me to the main, front entrance and let me out that way. He got his bunch of keys from his dresser.\n\n\"After we left his room and while we were still in the large corridor, leading into the celestial room, I was walking several steps ahead of grandpa when he stopped me, saying: 'Wait a moment, Allie. I want to tell you something. It was right here that the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me at the time of the death of President Woodruff. He instructed me to go right ahead and reorganize the First Presidency of the Church at once and not wait as had been done after the death of the previous presidents, and that I was to succeed President Woodruff.'\n\n\"Then Grandpa came to a step nearer and held out his left hand and said: 'He stood right here, about three feet above the floor. It looked as though he stood on a plate of solid gold.' \n\"Grandpa told me what a glorious personage the Savior is and described His hands, feet, countenance and beautiful White Robes, all of which were of such a glory of whiteness and brightness that he could hardly gaze upon Him.\n\n\"Then Grandpa came another step nearer me and put his right hand on my head and said: 'Now, granddaughter, I want you to remember that this is the testimony of your grandfather, that he told you with his own lips that he actually saw the Savior here in the Temple and talked with Him face to face.' \"Then we went on and Grandpa let me out of the main front door of the Temple.\"\n\nVideo completed by Kevin Kraut, son of Ogden Kraut.

At the press of a button the Quadski's wheels deploy when approaching land and retract after entering the water.\n\nPreviously, no commercially available amphibian has been able to exceed 10 mph (16 km/h) on water. The difference is the breakthrough GIBBS patented technology provides unique on-water performance. Unmatched freedom on water AND land, and rapid in transition - Quadski sets a new standard in flexibility, freedom and fun for personal watercraft.\n\nQuadski is powered by BMW Motorrad's K1300 engine. On water the BMW engine is coupled with GIBBS patented water jet propulsion system. The Quadski is capable of attaining speeds of 45 mph (72 km/h) on both water and land. Excellent performance and comfortable ride are the result of a light weight composite hull, wide track and low centre of gravity, which gives Quadski robust stability on water and land.\n\nIncorporating GIBBS HSA technology, the Quadski hull provides a stable planing surface and lateral grip for responsive handling on water. The hull is designed to be hydrodynamic in marine mode. The Quadski's hull is strong, durable, light-weight and is manufactured from a single-piece mould using current composite technology.\n\nGIBBS jet units are lighter and more compact than traditional marine industry water jets and provide high levels of thrust and manoeuverability on water. Water jet propulsion also provides responsive manoeuverability at low speeds and reverse while providing power to cruise at planing speeds. GIBBS water jet technology can propel the Quadski to planing speed in seconds.\n\nThe Suspension gives superb ride and handling on land and retracts when on the water. The complete transition takes four seconds, at the push of a button.", "title": "Gibbs Sports - Quadski High Speed Amphibious (HSA) Personal Watercraft [720p]", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T11:01:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RsQUEiRTbU", "description": "Un altro esempio dell'eccezionale coerenza compositiva del grande musicista: il celebre valzer dal balletto \"La bella addormentata\" in una versione rovesciata: mentre il video procede nella normale esecuzione, l'audio originale \u00e8 digitalmente  riprodotto all'inverso.\nAltri interessanti esempi qui:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP6pxMp-giA&feature=related\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTLG-5EtcdA&feature=related\n\nPER MAGGIORI INFO SUL REVERSE SPEECH\nvisita: http://lnx.nadayoga.it/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=151", "title": "Tchaikovsky reverse valzer  by Riccardo Misto", "publishedDate": "2011-02-09T13:50:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RsjKWe8n2Y", "description": "Althea & Donna - uptown top ranking ( remix 2012)\n\nim still in love riddim 2012\n\nhttp://bakenstreetmusic.blogspot.mx/", "title": "Althea & Donna - uptown top ranking ( remix 2012)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-13T00:24:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RskwF0C9p4", "description": "", "title": "tvpce.cz Z\u00e1sah speci\u00e1ln\u00ed jednotky p\u0159i zat\u00fdk\u00e1n\u00ed drogov\u00fdch dealer\u016f", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T14:43:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Rt1ERBHZjg", "description": "Many consumers may be scared to invest since there has been a lot of volatility in the stock market but it may be time to jump back in.

Vermutlich ist der Kirchturm schon viel \u00e4lter. Mit der Friedhofsmauer diente sie lange dem Schutz vor Feinden. \n\nIm Jahre 1194 weihte Bischof Otto die Kirche zum zweiten Mal. Die dritte Konsekration erfolgte vermutlich 1402. 1598 wurde die  Kirche durch Bischof Johann Conrad von Gemmingen renoviert und ausstaffiert. Sein Wappen ist heute noch an der Ostseite des Turmes zu sehen. \n\nVon 1634-1664 war die Kirche in Folge des 30-j\u00e4hrigen Krieges verw\u00fcstet, leer und ohne Priester. Erst 50 Jahre nach Ende dieses unseligen Krieges regte sich in der Kirche wieder Leben. 1705 wurde mit der Reparatur der Turmhelms begonnen. \n\n1730 stiftete Walburga Hueber den Josefa-Altar. Der uralte Marienaltar wurde 1733 von 3 Gutt\u00e4tern neu gestiftet. 1736 folgte die Sanierung des Kirchenschiffs mit einem neuen Dachstuhl, einer Stuckdecke und einer Kanzel von Franz Horneis. \n\nDen Hochaltar fertigten Schreiner Winter und Maler Weber um 1800. Im vergangenen Jahrhundert gab es zwei gro\u00dfe Renovierungen. 1936 wurden Innenraum und Alt\u00e4re vom Kirchenmaler Johann B\u00f6ckl renoviert. \n\nDie letzte gro\u00dfe Erneuerung erfolgte 1990 unter Kirchenpfleger Heinrich H\u00f6ppler.\n\nMusik:\nDexter Britain\n\"The Stars Are Out\"", "title": "St. Nicolaus Fiegenstall", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T00:55:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RvBLsFfPjQ", "description": "\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 Icon Airframe http://partner-moto.ru/category/motoshlem-icon-airframe/\n\n\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u043f\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438, \u0412\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d\u0443 789-59-49", "title": "\u041e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 Icon Airframe", "publishedDate": "2012-04-08T19:15:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RvI6ZI2JWc", "description": "Flatt & Scruggs perform \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" from 1965 at the Ryman Auditorium, featured on the Grand Ole Opry Vintage Classics DVD.

You can test it at home with a kit that you can get from a pharmacy where you dip your morning urine to see if you're pregnant. There is also a blood test. With this blood test we can check positive or negative or actually get an absolute quantity--a number that helps us understand how pregnant you are and how your pregnancy is progressing. \n\nNow Beta hCG was not developed or created to just let human beings know that they're pregnant. It has a purpose in the human body as a hormone that is secreted by the embryo after it implants into the wall. Its job is to send a message to the ovary to continue to secrete progesterone. \n\nWhen you go through an assisted reproductive procedure, we often trigger ovulation by giving you Beta hCG. It helps trigger ovulation, so you don't want to test too early because sometimes what you're measuring is the Beta hCH that you got from us, from the doctors, so you have to wait a certain amount of time to be sure that the Beta hCG that you're measuring is really coming from your embryo implanted into your uterus. \n\nAt the Fertility Partnership we give instruction to our patients about when and how to test themselves.", "title": "Beta hCG Test Defined", "publishedDate": "2010-06-12T01:03:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RwzMGH1cQw", "description": "FACEBOOK: http://on.fb.me/gxH2nC TWITTER: http://twitter.com/Krish_Genius \n\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\n\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\nGyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]\n\nBAD ARTISTES: MAVADO, BOUNTY KILLER, VYBZ KARTEL, BUSY SIGNAL, T'NEZ, AIDONIA, FLEXXX, LADEN, WAYNE MARSHALL, CHAN DIZZY, VERSATILE, NAVINO, DEABLO, IYARA, SIZZLA, CAPLETON, BOB MARLEY, KEIDA, BRIDGEZ, POPCAAN, JAH VINCI", "title": "Gyptian - Let Me In {Matrimony Riddim} June 2011 [Tru Music/Washroom Ent]", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T20:48:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RxGQKcdkEw", "description": "Second song off of the Windowlicker single.", "title": "Aphex Twin Spectogram", "publishedDate": "2007-02-28T22:22:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RxVTaSfTjs", "description": "there are more than 5 chests but be careful not to die i found  a chest with deadric bow dont forget to like comment and sub for more enjoy :)", "title": "skyrim - hidden chests in ragged flagon", "publishedDate": "2012-06-22T12:35:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6RxsVVtKLI0", "description": "Hier sehen Sie ein Motorrad-Gespann, einen sog.

From the moment of infection of the monocyte, the cat's fate hangs on whether or not that monocyte can contain the virus and eventually defeat it, or whether the virus wins, and begins replicating within the monocyte.  In this animation, we depict the latter.  We show how the virus hijacks the immune system, leading to an inflammatory sequence of events which results in a pyogranuloma forming around a blood vessel.  In the film we show the development of acute FIP, where there is a lot of virus, many blood vessels affected, and the resulting leakage from damaged blood vessels causes the clinical signs of effusive FIP -- ascites, thoracic effusion, pericardial effusion.  \n\nIn non-effusive FIP the course is more chronic: fewer blood vessels are affected, the cat's immune system tries harder to contain the infection, leading to larger pyogranulomata and the clinical signs of chronic inflammation and relating to the organ(s) containing the pyogranulomas.  \n\nThe catvirus.com website and You Tube channel are mainly aimed at postgraduate  veterinarians and undergraduate veterinary students, to supply information which is difficult to source elsewhere and to enable free online continuing professional development.  Non-veterinarians can find resources suitable for all cat lovers.at my website, www.catvirus.com.\n\n\nDr Diane D. Addie is a veterinary virologist with two dreams: to eradicate feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) from the face of the earth, and to find a cure for feline chronic gingivostomatitis.

When Freya lays eyes on Garren Lowe, she can't get him out of her head. She's sure that she knows him, despite his insistence that they've never met. As Freya follows her instincts and pushes towards hidden truths, the two of them unveil a strange and dangerous world where their days may be numbered.

Radial head arthroplasty is an alternative treatment with results that compare favorably with those reported after open ORIF of similar fractures. In this JBJS/VJO video supplement, doctors Grewal and King from Ontario, Canada, discuss important intraoperative points while demonstrating their surgical technique for implanting a modular radial head prosthesis. Dr. David Ring, of Boston, Massachusetts, provides additional commentary on the surgical technique. A key feature of the design includes a stem that allows for rotational motion at both the implant/bone interface and radiocapitellar articulation, potentially reducing capitellar wear. There are 150 different combinations of heads and stems that permit minimal bone removal while optimizing fit.", "title": "Elbow Surgery: Radial Head Arthroplasty with a Modular Metal Spacer", "publishedDate": "2011-08-19T17:26:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SJ-pFhCXQU", "description": "Translation by Markaz DaarutTawheed London\nTranscript: www.DaarutTawheed.com", "title": "The reality of a Call with the absence of Tawheed (Islamic Monotheism). - Shaykh Saalih al Fawzaan", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T22:30:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SJ0lGYT1EU", "description": "Christmas song written by the Vibration Nation and performed by Ron Hayden", "title": "Frosty, The Millwright", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T17:33:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SJF6kXrSD4", "description": "\u6d77\u5cb8\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u6e7f\u3063\u305f\u6797\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u82b1\u3092\u54b2\u304b\u305b\u305f\u30e0\u30b5\u30b7\u30a2\u30d6\u30df\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5236\u4f5c=\u3075\u308b\u3055\u3068\u7a2e\u5b50\u5cf6 http://www.furusato-tanegashima.net/", "title": "\u6625\u6d77\u5cb8\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u6e7f\u3063\u305f\u6797\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u82b1\u3092\u54b2\u304b\u305b\u305f\u30e0\u30b5\u30b7\u30a2\u30d6\u30df Arisaema ringens", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T14:50:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SJp7cpC5HA", "description": "5-20-2013, St Pats HS, First Round Varsity Playoffs vs Schurz HS @ UIC College Field, Bottom of 5, 3-run Walk Off HR, 330' left field fence, Trevor Heinlein, Freshman, BBCOR DeMarini Voodoo Bat.", "title": "#10 Trevor Heinlein Walk Off HR", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T21:38:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SKcmWrw6pA", "description": "This video is fragment of - Ray Mears' Wild Food (3)", "title": "Ray Mears Demonstrations - Stinging Nettle as Food", "publishedDate": "2013-10-12T01:39:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SKs9WRm_T4", "description": "Aqu\u00ed os dejo el tutorial de como tocar la canci\u00f3n de \"Elfen Lied\" a viol\u00edn de Lilium.

Franz Bracht Kranvermietung specializes in heavy lifts and was hired to erect Enercon E-101 wind turbines at the wind farm. Reaching a hub height of 149 meters, these turbines are the largest models of the E-101 series. For the erection of these giants, the crane service provider relied on the capabilities of the new Terex\u00ae Superlift 3800 lattice boom crawler crane, which was developed with  this type of application in mind.\n\nThe new Superlift 3800 crawler crane showed its power and efficiency right from the setup on site. Thanks to the crane's lateral outriggers, the Bracht team erected it with much less ballast than would be necessary for other cranes of the same class and without an assist crane, reducing transport costs. \"This not only shortens the setup time, but also means that fewer transportation trucks are required, which saves us money,\" says crane operator Michael Hildebrand. Thanks to its design to make assembly easy, the crane was fully set up with an SLS + LF_4, 153 m main boom and + 12 m LF superlift configuration in a mere two days -- ready to erect the wind turbines.", "title": "Terex Superlift 3800 crawler crane from Franz Bracht erecting Enercon E-101 150m wind turbines.", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T09:47:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SU9ZEg09Gg", "description": "", "title": "V.T Marvin-Rentier", "publishedDate": "2012-03-12T19:56:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SUDm0BvCGo", "description": "Music video by Erick Sermon performing Hostile.

All you have to do is borrow a quarter from someone, put it in your hand, and you're going to show them that you have superhuman strength by rubbing on that coin.  Just rub, rub, rub, rub, and push down on the coin, and then, hopefully, you're able to cause that coin to bend.  \n\nHere's the explanation behind the coin bend magic trick.  All you need to do is borrow a coin from a friend and, before you borrow the coin from a friend, you have to make a bent coin up yourself.  Here's a very impromptu way of doing this.  Grab a hammer, take a coin, preferably a quarter. Go outside and, the pavement cracks in between the cement, stick the coin in one of those cracks. Take the hammer and hammer down on top of the coin. That coin, as you hammer it, will start to bend in half. It's a very impromptu way of bending a coin. Now if you have access to a vice, you're more than welcome to do it that way. Just turn it in the vice.  Make sure it's nice and tight and then hammer it that way.  But not everyone has a vice or a work shed, so you can go outside and make it by using the pavement.\n\nNow that you have your bent quarter, you're ready to start the trick. Place the bent quarter on your middle finger and it will be nice and clipped because of the bend. Show the quarter to your audience. Come in. As you come in front of the coin, you're going to drop the quarter, but replace it with the bent coin. Like that. And you say that you're just going to start lightly start brushing the coin with your middle finger, like that.  As you do, you can make some sounds as if you're pushing on the coin, a grunt or whatever you'd like.  \n\nWhen you're done rubbing, just remove your finger and show that the coin has bent.  As a bonus, if you'd like to show your friends that you have some psychic powers, you can then give the illusion that the coin is bending by holding it between your thumb and forefinger. If you push the coin up, it will naturally bow outward. And it's a perfect illusion, if done right.  And I highly recommend practicing it in front of a mirror.  As you say the word, \"bend, bend, bend, bend,\" you push that coin up into view and it will give the illusion the coin is bending even further.  I hope you have fun with the coin bend magic trick.", "title": "How to Do the Coin Bend Trick | Coin Tricks", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T15:54:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Sxlopi76Yo", "description": "\u00daltimas tomas del Periodista Anibal Archila (QEPD), que falleci\u00f3 cuando cubr\u00eda para \"Noti 7\u2033 la noticia sobre la erupcion de lava y ceniza volc\u00e1nica del Volc\u00e1n San Vicente de Pacaya", "title": "Erupci\u00f3n Volc\u00e1n Pacaya Ultimas tomas Anibal Archila (QEPD)", "publishedDate": "2010-05-28T07:18:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Sy6sNrSStA", "description": "Willie Nelson recites his song \"Me and Paul\".\n\nAnthony Herrera, Steve McGraw, Tandy Cronyn\nSinger/Song Writer: Willie Nelson", "title": "Me and Paul by Willie Nelson", "publishedDate": "2012-05-26T15:27:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6SyUJxYaQQQ", "description": "", "title": "DON RACHIS CORTANDO NOPALES", "publishedDate": "2011-10-20T00:41:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Sy_ONUtCh0", "description": "", "title": "VER FUENTE DE MARACO PARA SOCIAL EMPIRES", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T15:36:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Sys43A3U5Y", "description": "Volg B-Brave op Spotify: http://bit.ly/BBraveSP \nThank you BRAVIOURS for your LOVE & Support! \n\nComposed by: B.

New Zealand pigeons are commonly called wood pigeons but are not the same as the Wood Pigeon (Columba palumbus), which is a member of a different genus.

The members of this subfamily feed largely on fruits, mainly drupes. New Zealand Pigeons are members of the pigeon genus Hemiphaga (Bonaparte, 1854), which is endemic to the New Zealand archipelago and Norfolk Island. However recently a Hemiphaga bone was found on Raoul Island. The Chatham Pigeon or Chatham Island Pigeon (Hemiphaga chathamensis) is traditionally considered a subspecies of the Kerer\u016b, but is here treated as a separate species.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\". Kecuali Wajah dan telapak tangan.", "title": "085 Video Cara Memakai Jilbab   Cara Memakai Jilbab Segi Empat Simple   Hijab Tutorial by TiTa 27 03", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T21:27:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6TE7dyez3mY", "description": "\"CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

Filmed over four years, 'Between Home' documents the odyssey of this Australian whiz-kid programmer. Beginning shortly after Jaffe purchases a second hand-boat in England, the film captures Jaffe's modulation of moods from high frequency stress to debased hilarity. Jaffe lives 'hand to mouth' while sinking deeper into debt and so invites the world to experience his dream through a blog that will help fund his voyage. And it works. The generosity of people wanting him to succeed is overwhelming yet it creates a paradox of added pressure from the world he's trying to retreat from. Alone at sea Jaffe keeps a video log, and answers questions given to him before departure. His philosophy appears to be a combination of auto-didacticism and 'gung ho libertarism' as he sails without permits or insurance.  At certain points on Jaffe's voyage, Rath catches up to him in Berlin, England, the Canary Islands, the Caribbean, Long Island, on a road trip across the U.S. As Jaffe voyages through the Pacific he encounters love, loss, and the ferocity of nature with a tsunami. As the sailor reaches his home shore Australia, the filmmaker meets him and captures Jaffe's abrupt confrontation with meaning of the term 'closure' in an unanticipated way.", "title": "BETWEEN HOME a film by Jack Rath (Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-19T13:57:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "6TFMROmvVlg", "description": "A short film based on my neighbors hatred for when people drop his shower loofah on the ground for no reason.

There is more evidence suggesting that being bilingual is good for your brain. A new study found that older adults who have spoken two languages since childhood showed better mental skills than those who speak just one language. Earlier studies showed that the ability to speak 2 languages, or bilingualism, seemed to favor the development of these heightened skills. The study appeared in the Journal of Neuroscience. Brian Gold was the lead author of the study. He is a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. Dr. Gold and his team asked people to sort colors and shapes in a series of simple exercises. They used brain imaging to compare how well three groups of people switched among these exercises. The groups were bilingual seniors, monolingual seniors and younger adults. The imaging showed different patterns of activity in the frontal part of the brain, in an area used for processing those tasks.  Dr. Gold says the results suggest that bilingual subjects use their brain more efficiently. Dr. Gold notes that knowing a second language made no difference for the young adults. They did better at the exercises than both groups of older people. But he says the older bilingual adults appear to have built up a surplus from a lifetime of increased mental activity. He says his research confirms an earlier study on bilingualism among patients with Alzheimer's disease. That study showed that bilingual speakers suffered more brain damage, but were able to think at the same level as patients with less damage. Dr. Gold says he believes the new study confirms that bilingualism can protect brain performance.

He was formerly Professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He was voted Britain's leading public intellectual by readers of Prospect magazine and was named one of Time Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" for 2007.\n\nDawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene\", which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term \"meme\". He is a prominent critic of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book \"The Blind Watchmaker\", he argued against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he described evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker. He has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television and radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics.\n\nRichard Dawkins is an atheist, secular humanist, sceptic, scientific rationalist, and supporter of the Brights movement. In his 2006 book \"The God Delusion\", he contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that faith qualifies as a delusion \u2212 as a fixed false belief.\n\n\u2022 http://www.richarddawkins.net\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/richarddawkinsdotnet\n\u2022 http://tinyurl.com/DawkinsVideos\n\nIf you enjoy the video and would like to support the work of The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, please purchase the program on DVD at http://richarddawkins.net/store/\n.", "title": "Religious Beliefs And Objective Truth", "publishedDate": "2008-10-17T12:22:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6TP7QAOq34I", "description": "A quick video of the Ivy City coach yard taken onboard MARC 414 on my way to Odenton MD.

Just to let you know that Gordon (the gentleman camera right) sadly passed away last year. He was a hardy old soul with a good heart and a matching sense of humour (which is perhaps why he wore his trouser so high). He served in the Merchant Navy most of his working life and survived several ship sinking escapes caused by German torpedoes in WWII. We miss him, but a bit of him lives on in those who have had the pleasure to have met him.\n\nPeter (in the middle) is Gordon's younger brother. He is Brightlingsea born and bred and spent his working life on top of people's rooftops mending their broken television aerials. Peter cunningly mixed his work with pleasure,  a keen photographer  - he now boasts one of the largest collection of rooftop scenes of the coastal town of Brightlingsea in the entire coastal town of Brightlingsea!\n\nBoth of these \"Scotty Brothers\" are some of the last great spoon players of a generation who had some spoons and each other to play with growing up. They have played spoons together since a very young age which shows in their tacit, yet perfect,  timing.\n\nThe chap playing guitar is me, Tim Wheeler.\n\nThanks for watching and reading!

Ferns in this genus are widely known as staghorn or elkhorn ferns due to their uniquely-shaped fronds. This genus is epiphytic and is native to tropical and temperate areas of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Guinea. Platycerium sporophytes (adult plants) have tufted roots growing from a short rhizome that bears two types of fronds, basal and fertile fronds. Basal fronds are sterile, shield or kidney shaped and laminates against the tree and protects the fern's roots from damage and desiccation. In some Platycerium species the top margin of these fronds forms an open crown of lobes and thereby catches falling forest litter and water.\n\nStaghorns can be propagated by spores produced on the underside of the fertile fronds. Colonial Platycerium can also be vegetatively propagated by carefully dividing large healthy ones into smaller, separate plants. These new plants can then be attached to board mounts or be strapped to trees until they take to the tree themselves. A mature staghorn can grow more than 1 metre (3.3 ft) wide. When positioned well, Platycerium species are able to add focal points, privacy, and a tropical look to gardens.\n\nVanda is a genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae) which, although not large (about fifty species), is one of the most important florally. This genus and its allies are considered to be the most highly evolved of all orchids within Orchidaceae. The genus is very highly prized in horticulture for its showy, fragrant, long lasting, and intensely colorful flowers. The name \"Vanda\" is derived from the Sanskrit name for the species Vanda tessellata. These mostly epiphytic, but sometimes lithophytic or terrestrial orchids are distributed in India, Himalaya, SE Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, southern China and northern Australia.\n\nThe color blue is rare among orchids, and only Thelymitra crinita, a terrestrial species from Australia produce flowers that are truly \"blue\" among the orchids, the other being Aganisia cyanea, a lowland species from Northern South America that is difficult in cultivation, but has metallic blue flowers. Both of this species much like Vandas also have a bluish purple tint towards the inner petals of the flowers. \n\n\nMany Vanda orchids (especially Vanda coerulea) are endangered, and have never been common because they are usually only infrequently encountered in habitat and grow only in disturbed forest areas with high light levels, and are severely threatened and vulnerable to habitat destruction. The export of wild-collected specimens of the Blue Orchid (Vanda coerulea) and other wild Vandas is prohibited worldwide, as all orchids are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.\n\nSikkim is a landlocked Indian state located in the Himalayan mountains. The state borders Nepal to the west, China's Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and east, and Bhutan to the southeast. The Indian state of West Bengal lies to the south. With around 607,000 inhabitants as of 2011, Sikkim is the least populous state in India and the second-smallest state after Goa in total area, covering approximately 7,096 km2 (2,740 sq mi). Sikkim is nonetheless geographically diverse due to its location in the Himalayas; the climate ranges from subtropical to high alpine, and Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak, is located on Sikkim's border with Nepal. Sikkim is a popular tourist destination, owing to its culture, scenery and biodiversity. It also has the only open land border between India and China. Sikkim's capital and largest city is Gangtok.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Feldman, Andrew Niccol, Richard Luke Rothschild, Scott Rudin, Lynn Pleshette\nScreenwriter: Andrew Niccol\nFilm Description: Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script. Exteriors were filmed in the Victorian-styled upscale community of Seaside, Florida. In addition to the Burkhard Dallwitz score, original music by Philip Glass and classical excerpts are also featured.\n\n\"the truman show\",\"the truman show clip\",\"the truman show trailer\",\"the truman show part 1\",\"the truman show full movie\",\"jim carrey\",\"laura linney\",\"noah emmerich\",\"peter weir\",\"coffee can videos\",comedy,\"showbiz dramas\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"scott rudin\",\"richard luke rothschild\",\"edward s feldman\",\"andrew niccol\",\"lynn pleshette\",\"madness videos\",\"kitchen videos\",\"truman burbank\",marlon,\"meryl burbank\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++161628,/m/0lx2l,/m/06hp9b,/m/020_95", "title": "The Truman Show (5/9) Movie CLIP - Do Something!

Flamingos are filter feeders, using their beaks to strain tasty morsels out of the water around them as they wade. To stir up the tastiest treats, flamingos will stamp their webbed feet.

I'm the owner/operator of Classic Cutlery in Costa Mesa, California. We have a great selection. We also have a website, classiccutlery.com, and today we're going to be talking about knives.\n\nOkay, a pocket knife is going to be usually a smaller knife that you're going to carry in your pocket all the time. If you get a knife that's too big, more than likely you're not going to have it when you need it. So you want to really consider how big you actually need, and if you plan on carrying it all the time, make sure it's something that you can have with you all the time, whether you're dressed in jeans or slacks, or even if a lady in a purse, you want to make sure you have the right size knife. \n\nOkay, old traditional pocket knife, it's like a small jackknife. Two blades, large blade, small blade. This particular one's made by Case Cutlery, Bradford, Pennsylvania, company my dad worked for. Just a nice simple little knife, rounded corners so it doesn't wear the pocket off. If you get something with square bolsters on it, you know, they can wear your pocket, especially if you wear tighter clothes. Also in the slip joints, you know, some guys, especially ranchers, farmers, they'll carry a three bladed Stockman as a pocket knife. You have the large clip blade, small sheep's foot, and a spay blade. Again, rounded corners, although a lot of them do have square bolsters. They're a little bit more heavy duty when they have that. \n\nThe other most popular pocket knife is a Swiss Army knife. This small Swiss Army classic made by Victorinox. It was brought home by the GI's after World War II and it's really become an American sensation. Still won't go through airport security, but it's a very popular, simple knife and it comes in a multitude of colors now. \n\nThen for somebody that's really into knives, we have a William Henry. William Henry is a small company based out of Oregon. With a knife like a William Henry that's $1,000, you don't want to just drop it in your pocket, so you're going to take and close it up, put it in a little case and then put it in your pocket. And in some of the William Henry's they have a pocket clip so it can actually go inside your pocket and not drop down into your change pocket, or if it doesn't have the clip on it then it'll drop all the way down. And they make a multitude of sizes. But they're great little pocket knives, especially for the guy that has everything and the guy that can afford everything.\n\nI actually have three knives in my pocket right now. Chris Reeves, it's a dog paw, which is a Classic Cutlery exclusive with the dog paw tracks on it. And a Ken Onion Ripple, the American made one that Ken and I are doing. It's only a limited release titanium handle, IDKS bearing system. And a William Henry with a ZDP blade, white pearl.", "title": "What Is a Pocket Knife? | Knives", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T18:43:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6U9oduO68Dw", "description": "Buy this song on iTunes: http://bit.ly/1cpRwWM \nBuy this song on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1lnuEjd\nBuy this song on Google Play: http://bit.ly/1ftUglW\n\nSubscribe for more music videos: http://bit.ly/UwixSH\nLike our Facebook page for updates: http://facebook.com/simplythree\nFollow us on Twitter for exclusive updates: http://twitter.com/simply_three\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/simplythree\nWebsite: http://simplythreemusic.com\n\nThe Song\nArranged and performed by Nick Villalobos and Zack Clark from Simply Three\nRecorded by Jared Nielson at Audio Welders (http://audiowelders.com)\nMixed by Ed Boyer (http://edboyeracappella.com)\nMastered by Dave Sperandio (http://vocalmastering.com)\n\nThe Video\nDirected by Greyson Sawyer and Matthew Helms (http://aphesus.com/)\nCinematography by Ovi Balc (http://mindmaze.net)\nEdited and color graded by Zack Clark\nActress: Sarah Sawyer\n\nLast year, Nick and Zack arranged this duet version of Somewhere Only We Know by Keane for fun.

So we were hanging out a Nick's house, working, brainstorming, and playing our instruments. We downloaded the chord chart to Somewhere Only We Know, and Zack started plucking at his cello. Nick joined in, and the song almost literally wrote itself. Alex thinks it's really beautiful, too, and when we had a little break away from her last month (she lives in New York City), we though this would be a perfect time to record and release it!

Since this will strike on the quarters, we need two trains to accomplish this as with any conventional quarter striking clock; one train for the hours and one for the quarters. Therefore two flies are needed. What you see here is the quarter strike fly being tested by manually turning the quarter strike train. This is based on Charles Fasoldt's design for a remontoire fly fan in one of two astronomical tower clocks built in 1872. We have enhanced his design by having the pinion that drives the long detent 'whip' driven from an internally toothed wheel rather than a conventional toothed wheel. This changes the geometry of the whip to trace its outline from an epicycloid to a hypocycloid configuration. You can graphically see this in last month's installment of the construction project here: www.my-time-machines.net\n\n\nWhat we are trying to accomplish here is the illusion that the fly whip will crash into one or both of the adjacent winding arbors. We also think the epicyclical movement of the fly assembly as a whole tends to grab the viewer making one's head bob or rotate to catch the movement.

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \"sheep\" applies to many species, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over 1 billion, domestic sheep are the most numerous species in their genus.\n\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.\n\nSheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.\n\nSheep-raising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word sc\u0113ap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob. Adult female sheep are referred to as ewes, intact males as rams or occasionally tups, castrated males as wethers, and younger sheep as lambs. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.\n\nBeing a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most-often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies\u2014such as the Golden Fleece\u2014and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.
