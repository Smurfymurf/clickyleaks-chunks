This shows how a college pitcher improved his pitching mechanics and boosted his pitching velocity from 83-90 mph after getting a video analysis and learning how to develop more force with his body. We know that arm strength has little to do with pitching velocity and that it is the body that produces velocity and not the arm.  This pitcher recently had a video analysis follow-up. We showed him some areas within his delivery that when improved could easily get his velocity to the 95 mph range consistently.

To apply the drift (speed) of the tide on the 11:30 Dead Reckoning (DR) position to our time frame we use the formula: \nD is equal to S times T divided by 60, where D is the distance in nautical miles, S is the tide speed, and T is the time in minutes. \nIn our case: 3 knots times 90 minutes divided by 60 equals 4.5 nautical miles. \nUsing the dividers, we span a distance of 4.5 miles on the latitude scale which is closest to the course line and which runs along the sides of the chart. \nWe apply this span, placing one leg of the dividers on the 11:30 DR position and the other leg on the 110 degrees tide set, marking the new position with a triangle, recording the time as 11:30.  \nThis is our 11:30 Estimated Position (EP).  \nUsing the parallel ruler, we transfer the 045 degrees course to the new 1130 Estimated Position, and from there we continue to plot our new positions as we progress on our route .", "title": "20   estimated position", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T11:14:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "A5WNbPXPZ7M", "description": "At the edge of the reef terrace at Monkey Shoals, St. Kitts, several sergeant majors (Abudefduf saxatilis) had deposited their purple eggs, each patch forming a perfect circle, 15-20 cm in diameter. The fish vigorously defended these from predators, including Andy.  He had placed his transect line a bit close to one territory, and the angry fish repeatedly nipped at his legs.  It's a good thing they are small!  While most fish were chased away, one of the fish was unsuccessful in defending his nest; several medium-sized herbivorous parrotfish overwhelmed the fish and rapidly consumed the eggs.  Mostly princess parrotfish, these species are supposed to eat algae.  It must have been an occasion for celebration, as they couldn't resist a luxury delicacy - Abudefduf caviar.

After having foraged for larvae and other grubs from tree bark, the Woodpecker male (the father has a red crest) comes back and regurgitates it at the opening of the nest-hole, in order to feed the chicks.\n\nThe woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers are a family, Picidae, of near-passerine birds. Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia and New Zealand, Madagascar, and the extreme polar regions. Most species live in forests or woodland habitats, although a few species are known to live in treeless areas such as rocky hillsides and deserts.\n\nThe Picidae are just one of the eight living families in the order Piciformes. Members of the order Piciformes, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be very closely related to the woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers. More recently, DNA sequence analyses have confirmed this view.\n\nThere are about 200 species and about 30 genera in this family. Many species are threatened or endangered due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation. Two species of woodpeckers, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and the Imperial Woodpecker, have been considered extinct for about 30 years (there has been some controversy recently whether these species still exist).\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Light microscopes have evolved from the simple single converging lens microscopes to the ultra modern compound binocular microscopes. \n\nThe simple microscopes produced magnifications of up to 9X but the current compound microscopes have increased magnifying powers up to 2000X. \nToday, compound light microscopes are the most commonly used magnifying devices in microbiology. \n\nThese microscopes consist of multiple lenses separated in two lens sets. The first set collects light form the specimen and the second set focuses the light into the camera or eye-piece. The microscope can be monocular for single eye-piece or binocular for two eye-pieces.\n\nThe compound light microscopes are also commonly considered as bright field microscopes because they contain their own light. This means that the specimen is viewed from above through the ocular lenses and lit from below. \n\nOrganisms become visible against the brightly lit field of view because of their different reflection densities. Similarly, compound microscopes are also used in darkfield microscopy where the organisms and other structures are illuminated against a dark field of view. \n\nSpecial condensers reflect light from the specimen at an angle thus enabling observation of bacteria. More advanced compound microscopes allow phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Phase contrast microscopy allows observation and examination of live and unstained organisms. \n\nThis type of microscopy utilizes special condensers and objective lenses which alter phase relationships of light penetrating through the specimen and that passing around it. On the other hand, specimens are stained with fluorochrome complexes in fluorescence microscopy before examination. Mercury vapor lamps or halogen lamps are used to direct high energy light with short wavelengths through the specimen 'exciting' the molecules within it. \n\nThe 'excited' molecules emit brilliant colors and other lights of different wavelengths which make them observable. This technique is especially used in rapid diagnostic kits with fluorescent antibodies for examining pathogens. \nThe greatest benefit of compound light microscopes is their simplicity and convenience. \nVisit: The Compound Light Microscope @ http://thecompoundlightmicroscope.com  for more information.", "title": "The Compound Light Microscope", "publishedDate": "2013-03-16T04:55:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "A5qHvePffKY", "description": "Website: http://www.1dayumay.com/\n\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=1DAYUMAY", "title": "Distended GUT is Ruining Bodybuilding!! 80's and 90's was BEST!!- PT1- Rich Piana", "publishedDate": "2014-03-28T10:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "A5qNt5LPfQQ", "description": "VERNIX", "title": "VERNIX", "publishedDate": "2010-04-21T16:49:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "A5qt-J5WdiE", "description": "La cantante y actriz estadounidense Miley Cyrus se presenta por segunda vez en Argentina e en el estadio GEBA (sede Jorge Newbery), en el marco de la gira Bangerz Tour.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Lexus IS F SPORT 2015 'Movie'", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:02:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "A5z1V7ep-5Y", "description": "Xhosa is one of the 11 official languages of South Africa.

Lucier in this Howcast video.\n\n\nThe main thing that I want to focus on is the colon reflex, the large and the small intestines.  So we're going to start over here on her right foot, my left.  The ileocecal valve, right there.  We're just going to begin to thumb walk up through the belly of the foot about midway through we'll switch.  That was the ascending colon.  Now we're going to go across here, transverse colon, go across the other foot.  \n\nSome people do one foot at a time, that's completely fine.  When it's a digestive issue I like to do it in this way, because I'm starting at the very beginning and going out through the end.  Now we've just made the bend and we're going down the descending colon.  You might want to really support the ankle or the heel here so you have more support when you're thumb walking down the foot.  \n\nAs you come through here mid point of the heel, that's a sigmoid colon.  You're just going to walk, thumb walk out the rectum reflex.  That's the whole large intestine. The small intestine is just inside that area right through here.   So you can do that also with thumb walking.  Thumb walk up, thumb walk up again, and you can do this from any angle, you can take it across through here.  You can also, if you have no one to do this for you there's the back of a chair that might have a pole there.  You can certainly always roll this area of your foot over something, that can give it some kind of relief. \n\nThe other thing you want to be mindful of is there's so many different conditions that effect the digestive system.  You have constipation, colitis, diverticulitis, gall stones, so many things that you want to be mindful of if there's something you want to give more attention to, please do.

This means that over time, the satellites become increasingly out of sync, appearing from Earth's perspective to drift farther apart, able to observe first the sides and eventually the far side of the sun. Now they are nearing each other once again, this time on the other side of the sun. During this period when the sun blocks Earth's view -- a geometrical position known in astronomy as a superior conjunction -- radio receivers on Earth will not be able to distinguish STEREO's signal from the sun's radiation. Communication with the spacecraft will cease and the satellites will both go into safe mode without collecting data for a time. This will happen for STEREO-Ahead from March 24 to July 7, 2015. STEREO-Behind will be in superior conjunction from Jan. 22 to March 23, 2015. At least one spacecraft, therefore, will always be collecting data.\nBefore this occurs, the heating from the sun will also begin to affect - though not shut down -- data collection. From wherever they are in space, the STEREO spacecraft aim their antenna toward Earth to send down data. This position puts the antenna fairly close to pointing at the sun, exposing the instruments to more heat than it can safely bear. The antenna can be adjusted to point in different directions, but the signal coming to Earth will be much fainter and won't allow for as much data to be downloaded. This antenna adjustment will begin on Aug. 20, 2014, for the STEREO-Ahead spacecraft and on Dec. 1, 2014, for STEREO-Behind.\n\nDuring this phase, STEREO instruments will continue to run 24 hours a day, but they will gather lower-resolution data than usual. Some of this data will be downloaded whenever STEREO can link up with an Earth receiver. The rest of the data will be stored on board to be downloaded when the spacecraft reach a more auspicious geometrical position in early 2016.\n\nTo test for this off-pointing from the sun, STEREO-Ahead will undergo tests and not be collecting data from July 6-12, 2014. The same tests will be performed on STEREO-Behind from Sept. 29 - Oct. 6, 2014.\nThroughout this entire phase until 2016, at least one STEREO spacecraft will be capturing data at any one time, so scientists will have an uninterrupted record of events on the sun to coordinate with the observations of solar telescopes on the Earth side. Real time monitoring of the sun, its flares and coronal mass ejections - information used by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help forecast space weather -- will also continue via a fleet of NASA spacecraft closer to Earth.\n\nThis video is public domain and can be downloaded at: http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?11602\n\nLike our videos?

Emergency crews can't get past the vehicles in the roadway and ambulances are having trouble reaching neighborhoods down choked streets.\n\nRoads impacted the worst are Union, Transit, Seneca, Harlem, William, Clinton, Losson, Ridge and Walden. Anyone stranded in a vehicle is urged to call 911 and inform dispatchers of their location.\n\nDespite ongoing efforts, motorists remain stranded. The county is advising those motorists to remain with their vehicles. The sheriff's office says the weather is creating life threatening situations and that people are getting hurt just trying to walk to locations. They advise staying out of the elements so crews can do their jobs.\n\nFull story at WKBW:\nhttp://www.wkbw.com/news/emergency-in-erie-county-roads-are-parking-lots", "title": "Deadly snow storm, National Guard arrives in Erie County", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T04:39:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "A672e8rZrJg", "description": "Lightwater Valley's Enterprise filmed on a glorious afternoon on 23rd April 2011.", "title": "\"Black Widows Web\" Enterprise, Lightwater Valley", "publishedDate": "2011-04-25T17:37:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A675FNMQ8ik", "description": "Mon chien est un peu trop obs\u00e9d\u00e9 par les balles et les frisbees....lol", "title": "Jack et le frisbee", "publishedDate": "2007-08-15T23:01:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "A67lIQUEkIc", "description": "Japanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!\nJapanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!", "title": "Japanese Guy Kills Otter With Bang!", "publishedDate": "2013-07-21T07:03:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "A67pgJyTIpc", "description": "Isn't it funny how heated things get when you just can't seem to beat your trash talking opponent?

As part of M&S' campaign 'Put childhood leukaemia to bed', M&S donated 10% from all the sales of Kids nightwear for a limited period* contributing to funding important research to help save children's lives.\n\nThe four children photographed modelling the M&S nightwear have all survived Leukaemia.\n\nEvery day a child is diagnosed with leukaemia and with that devastating news a family's life is turned upside down. Thanks to continued investment in pioneering research by the charity, over 90% of children now survive the most common form of childhood leukaemia. But treatments are still very aggressive and can have long-lasting effects. And sadly some children still die from this terrible disease.\n\nLeukaemia & Lymphoma Research's immediate goal is to ensure current treatments are as effective and safe as possible so these children can go on to live healthy, happy lives.\n\nAll money raised through the 'Putting Childhood Leukaemia to Bed' campaign will be invested in research to help save the lives of every child with leukaemia.\n\nTo find out more about Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research or to make a donation visit www.beatbloodcancers.org\n\nFind out more at http://plana.marksandspencer.com/about/partnerships/leukaemia-and-lymphoma", "title": "M&S - Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research - Marks & Spencer 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-05-29T11:18:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6AAS5dRyh4", "description": "Please Like Us On Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/758-Our-Culture-Our-Movement/319073278180382\n\nARTISTE: Nicole David \nTITLE: Bacchanal-lay\nCOUNTRY: St.Lucia\nRIDDIM: Pretty Bounce \nYEAR: 2014\nProduced by:  Courtney \"Curty\" Louis & Yannick \"Fresh Prince\" Plante  Of Dutch Productions From St.Lucia", "title": "Nicole David - Bacchanal-lay [Pretty Bounce Riddim][2014 St Lucia Soca][Dutch Production SLU]", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T02:08:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6AFH3GyIH4", "description": "Clipe da m\u00fasica \"Tudo Que Eu Sou\", do m\u00fasico, cantor e compositor Eli Soares.\nUm Entretenimento.

But the more advanced, decision-making part of your brain will tell you to stay calm and play dead. \n\nA more practical example would include walking by a table of free donuts when you're hungry and not taking the bait. Willpower is simply your ability to inhibit your brain's natural inclinations. In other words, willpower is your ability to say 'no' to bad decisions. And saying 'no' to bad decisions is critical to developing as a leader and achieving your goals.\n\nStanford University professor Baba Shiv performed an experiment, now known as the Baba Shiv Experiment, involving two groups of students. Individuals in the first group were given a two-digit number to remember, while individuals in the second group were given a seven-digit number to remember. \n\nBoth groups were instructed to remember the number, walk down a long hallway, and repeat the number to another experimenter in a room down the hall. The interesting part is that halfway down the hall, a young woman was waiting by a table with a large plate of fresh orange slices on one side and a large plate of chocolate fudge cake on the other side. She asked each participant to choose which snack they would like after completing the memorization task. \n\nThe people in the second group, those laboring under the strain of remembering a seven-digit number, chose the cake far more often than those who had to recall the two-digit number. This is the result of ego depletion, or decision fatigue.\n\n*Corrections to video: The experiment was performed on students, not middle-aged people and the first group only had to memorize a 2-digit number not a three digit number.", "title": "What Is Willpower Depletion", "publishedDate": "2013-11-22T00:38:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6NsOLaC7_o", "description": "The Global Impact Challenge supports British non-profits using tech to tackle the world's toughest problems.

It's actually good pork.'\nAt the end of the video the McRib is put to the test.\nThe patty is finished off in a barbecue marinade and served in a bun. Pickles and onions are sprinkled on top. \n\nMr Imahara and Mr Bellamy, who have never tasted a McRib before, appear to enjoy the 500-calorie sandwich, licking their fingers and putting in a request for seconds.\n'The sandwich is actually pretty good. It's actually really good,' Mr Bellamy chimes.\nThe new push comes as McDonald's fights to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid 1.5per cent at established locations in the most recent quarter, following a 0.2per cent dip for last year.\nIn addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives.\nTo improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches.\nIt also plans to eventually let people swap out the french fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables.", "title": "What IS the McRib made of?", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T21:22:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6VlwRls6L4", "description": "This is a Ice Bucket Challenge not just 4 ALS but 4 the FucCCancer Lyfe Style.... 2 avoid this crafty killer, live rite, eat rite, bottom line take care of ya self.", "title": "X O Carcinoid Caner", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T07:52:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6W81dg2SbI", "description": "Featured video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1SB54FrhiE\n\nWebsite: http://jeromefitness.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/jlvi13/193888540646516?ref=ts\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=jlvi13\n\nNew articles on website:\nhttp://www.jeromefitness.com/gaining-muscle", "title": "\"300\" Body Weight Workout: Spartan Style Killer Calisthenics!", "publishedDate": "2012-06-25T05:48:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6W87amwV-k", "description": "The window washers who were rescued from a dangling rig off the WTC speak to CNN's Miguel Marquez.", "title": "Rescued window washer: I held on and hoped", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T02:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6WGnDsIA-g", "description": "Sonic Boom but Gill Grunt on the box RARE!!!!!!!!!!", "title": "Misprint Skylander", "publishedDate": "2012-12-07T21:09:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "A6WJss9ipFY", "description": "This is the old Swedich technique for weaving tapes on an inkle loom.

The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \"divorce\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure. And if a mate dies, or is killed by a predator, the remaining mate will take up with another; however, if all goes well in the pairing, they indeed will stay together for life. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.\n\nThe swans are the largest members of the waterfowl family Anatidae, and are among the largest flying birds. The largest species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can reach a length of over 1.5 m (60 inches) and weigh over 15 kg (33 pounds). Their wingspans can be almost 3 m (10 ft). Compared to the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks. Adults also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males are generally bigger and heavier than females.\n\nThe swans are generally found in temperate environments, rarely occurring in the tropics. A group of swans is called a bevy or a wedge in flight. Four (or five) species occur in the Northern Hemisphere, one species is found in Australia and New Zealand and one species is distributed in southern South America. They are absent from tropical Asia, Central America, northern South America and the entirety of Africa. One species, the mute swan, has been introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSwans feed in the water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of aquatic animals. In the water food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants.\n\nMute swan threatens a photographer in Toyako, Japan.\nAlthough swans only reach sexual maturity between 4 and 7 years of age, they can form socially monogamous pair bonds from as early as 20 months that last for many years, and in some cases these can last for life. The lifespan of the mute swan is often over 10 years, and sometimes over 20, whereas the black-necked swan survives for less than a decade in captivity. These bonds are maintained year round, even in gregarious and migratory species like the tundra swan, which congregate in large flocks in the wintering grounds. The nest is on the ground near water and about a metre across. Unlike many other ducks and geese the male helps with the nest construction. Average egg size (for the mute swan) is 113\u00d774 mm, weighing 340 g, in a clutch size of 4 to 7, and an incubation period of 34--45 days. With the exception of the whistling ducks they are the only anatids where the males aid in incubating the eggs.\n\nSwans are known to aggressively protect their nests. One man was suspected to have drowned in such an attack.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan\n\nThis video taken from Alipore Zoo at the time of visiting myself in April, 2014.

Object pronouns contrast with subject pronouns. Object pronouns in English take the objective case, sometimes called the oblique case or object case.[1] For example, the English object pronoun me is found in \"They see me\" (direct object), \"He's giving me my book\" (indirect object), and \"Sit with me\" (object of a preposition); this contrasts with the subject pronoun in \"I see them,\" \"I am getting my book,\" and \"I am sitting here.\"\n\nA reflexive pronoun is a pronoun that is preceded by the noun, adjective, adverb or pronoun to which it refers (its antecedent) within the same clause. In generative grammar, a reflexive pronoun is an anaphor that must be bound by its antecedent (see binding). In a general sense, it is a noun phrase that obligatorily gets its meaning from another noun phrase in the sentence.[1] Different languages will have different binding domains for reflexive pronouns, according to their structure.\n\nme (first-person singular pronoun, referring to the speaker)\n\nAs the direct object of a verb.\nCan you hear me?\n(obsolete) Myself; as a reflexive direct object of a verb. \u2003\nAs the object of a preposition.\nCome with me.\nAs the indirect object of a verb.\nHe gave me this.\n(US, colloquial) Myself; as a reflexive indirect object of a verb; the ethical dative. \n(colloquial) As the complement of the copula (\"be\" or \"is\").\nIt wasn't me.\n(Australia, UK, New Zealand, colloquial) My; preceding a noun, marking ownership. \u2003\n(colloquial, with \"and\") As the subject of a verb.\nMe and my friends played a game.\n(nonstandard, not with \"and\") As the subject of a verb. \u2003\n\nPronoun[edit]\nmyself (reflexive case of I)\n\n(reflexive) Me, as direct or indirect object the speaker as the object of a verb or preposition, when the speaker is also the subject.

First thing that people always want to know is how do you not cry with an onion. The main answer to this is absolutely, absolutely a sharp knife. If you have a dull knife, no matter anything I teach you, you are going to cry with the onion. It is just a fact of life. \n\nSo, the second part is you want to use always a slicing motion instead of a chopping motion. If you use a chopping motion, you will crush the cell structure that releases the gas that makes you cry. So, sharp knife, slicing motion. \n\nStart with an onion. You want to cut off the root structure. That is where the bacteria lives, but you notice, I cut just below that structure. I want this left so that it holds the onion together in a minute. It will become very important. Then I cut the top off. Once those are out of the way, you can cut straight down the center. This makes it easier to peel. \n\nYou always want to get that outer layer off. The outer layer is usually quite rubbery and tough. If it looks like something you do not want to eat, then do not use it. OK? Now, most people want to cut their onion like this. They go this way, and then they come this way, and then this way. This makes me nervous. I have landed that knife in my palm, and you do not have as much control. You always go a little bit this way, or a little bit this way. \n\nThe way that I have gotten around that is I cut my onion down the middle first. Once you have cut the onion down the middle, you want to imagine that there is an invisible line. Never cut past that invisible line, and the onion will stay together. You go straight in. You put the tip of your knife in at the invisible line and you drag the knife straight out. Again, with the slicing motion, not chopping. \n\nOnce you have gotten straight lines all the way down, you are going to flip the onion and do it again, so that you have now effectively done the same thing as if you had gone this way, but without ever aiming that blade at your hand. Once you have gotten those done, you can go straight across, and now these onions are nicely cubed. This is what you are going to want to do any time that your onions are going to stay in the final product because they are nice and even. \n\nNow, if you are going to strain the onion out, another way that is a little bit faster, and a cheating way to do it, is to follow the curve of the onion. So, if you notice, when I am down at this side, I go around, and then once I get up to the top, I am going straight down again.

This is that book.  Sanctioned by the Vincent Price Estate and daughter Victoria, THE PRICE OF FEAR is not only told through journalist Eisner's personal interviews with Price himself but with the cooperation, direct interviews and quotes from many of those with whom Price worked with throughout his illustrious career.  Before he passed away, all Vincent saw of this book was his fellow actor Peter Cushing's heartfelt foreward.\n\n Introducing the true story of a man born within a moderately wealthy family of candy manufacturers in 1911 St. Louis, Missouri, whose interest in theatre during the Great Depression led him into eventually becoming, arguably, the most universally iconic personification of the horror genre in the entire encompassment of the 20st Century.  That man was Vincent Leonard Price, Jr.\nWhat you now hold in your hands is the only authorized, official biography about Vincent Price's entire life in films ever published in history with his direct participation and approval, in his own words.  Never before has the story of Vincent's life been told, how he rose from dramatic theatre and stage to joining the ranks of the early cultured Hollywood elite fresh from where motion pictures were first spawned to eventually spend his life behind horrifying makeup and horror genre movie roles at the sacrifice of a greater passion for fine art and comedy.    \n\nFor nearly a century, we've known the name. We've heard the voice. We've seen the many faces.  At last, with The Price of Fear: The Film Career of Vincent Price, in His Own Words, we can know the man, directly from the legend himself, in this never-before-published highly entertaining and inspirational masterpiece.\n\nPublished by Black Bed Sheet Books, the world's #1 publisher of independent underground horror fiction.

But is it too late, and will the rest of Los Angeles fall victim to the ongoing displacement of immigrant communities and people of color?  \n\nOrganizers and lawyers say that gang injunctions take away civil liberties, promote racial profiling and criminalize the youth. It has been proven that gang injunctions are used as a tool for removing a certain group of people from their communities and replacing them with others who are more affluent - they turn streets into prisons without walls.  \n\nYouth CineMedia 2014", "title": "Echo Park Gang Injunction Defendant", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T05:12:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7ApDYDzcKc", "description": "Gerstl \n\nMao\n\nTung\n\nShun\n\nFervid", "title": "Double Engels Lappish", "publishedDate": "2010-12-12T08:56:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7Aqm4r3X1Q", "description": "nilgai antelopes near Port Mansfield Texas 2012-10-21.

Ampthill market has been held on a Thursday since 1219 and was confirmed by royal charter when the first of a number of annual fairs was authorised. The markets and fairs were for cattle as well as goods, and spilled along the main roads, particularly Dunstable Street, which was known as Cowfair End for a time.\n\nIn the mid-1780s, Lord Upper Ossory of Ampthill Park Jed a campaign to Improve the town centre (and increase income from the market) by creating a Market Square in front of a new Market House (now Richardson's), and tidying up the butchers' shambles, which ran from the Market House and into the Oxlet. (The butchers had been particularly unpopular in the 15th century when they were always throwing rotting offal into the town pond, the Oxflood).\n\nA new well was sunk on the Market Square and a pump installed encased in a stone obelisk (the gift of lord Ossory) and surmounted by an oil lamp. The town clock, formerly on the old market house, was set in a new turret surmounted by a cupola, and placed on the 15th century Moot Halll where the manor court met. The Moot Hall (similar to that at Elstow) was pulled down in 1852, and the town clock moved to present Clock House, which replaced it. \n\nFrom the Market Square two of the town's former coaching inns can be seen, the White Hart, a front of about 1730 on a very much older building once known as the Red Hart, remains in business. The White Hart is Ampthills principal coaching inn. A fa\u00e7ade from around 1730 fronts a much older interior. In 1975 a wall painting was discovered under the plaster in the front room depicting the Prince of Wales feathers, dated 1646. The hotel was badly damaged by fire in 2001. The King's Arms, formerly the Crown, now 9 Church Street, has an 18th century front, but is similarly much older; it closed in the 1950s when the ground floor was converted into shops.\n\nIn the Kings Arms Yard are ancient buildings used in the 17th century to house needy people at the expense of the parish. It is thought that the roundel of pargetting with crown, fleur-de-lis, the dated 1677 and initials W.H commemorates this use \u00adthe initials standing for Work House.\n\nThe path leads on to me newer parts OT me town passing The Hop Ground, formerly belonging to the White Hart, but now after a century and more of neglect a remarkable garden created from 1967 by William Nourish, and since his death maintained for the Town Council by a group of volunteers.

According to statistics, 40 percent of mothers still choose a vaginal birth in 2007. \n\nIn most cases, babies will turn upside down into the birthing position in the weeks before his or her birth. But there are times when babies don't turn and remain in a breech position. During a vaginal delivery, the baby would emerge feet or butt-first. \n\nWe spoke with Dr. Franny Bechek, an Obstetrician at Riverton Hospital. She says there are many reasons why a baby doesn't turn while in the womb. \n\n\"Premature babies are at a higher risk of being breech,\" Bechek said. \"And another reason they may not turn is if there is something going on with the uterus. Sometimes it is just babies being babies.\"\n\nThere are some techniques to try to help the baby turn face down. \n\n\"One of the things we can offer women is an External Cephalic Version,\" said Bechek. \"And that is when you put your hands on mom's tummy and turning the baby or getting the baby to turn themselves backwards or forwards so they are in a head down position.\"\n\nNot all women are candidates for the procedure and sometimes it doesn't work. In that case, the woman and her doctor will need to decide if the baby should still be born vaginally or if the baby should be born by cesarean section. \n\n(Copyright 2014 Sinclair Broadcast Group)", "title": "Options for Breech Babies", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T18:47:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7IzPx_2FK8", "description": "Woodlouse spider (Dysdera crocata)\n\n* Family: Dysderidae,\n\n* Genus: Dysdera,\n\n* Species: D. crocata,\n\n* Phylum: Arthropoda,\n\n* Class: Arachnida,\n\n* Order: Araneae,\n\n* Suborder: Araneomorphae,\n\n* Type: Bugs,\n\n* Diet: Carnivore,\n\n* Avarege life span in the wilds: no data,\n\n* Size: Female specimens are 11-15 mm long while males are 9--10 mm,\n\n* Weight: no data,\n\n** Dysdera crocata, is a species of spider that preys exclusively upon woodlice.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

This sort of water flow is typical of most sponges, and the total amount of water pumped can be really substantial for large sponges.  Even this small sponge is surely pumping many times its body volume per day.\n\nThe sponge in this video was partially encrusting a small rock in a coral reef aquarium at Augsburg College (Minneapolis, MN).  The sponge growth has either a tan color or a grey color in this video, depending on the lighting for the different views.\n\nSponges are animals whose bodies are colonies of only a few different cell types.  The body of a sponge is hollow inside (or in a sponge such as this, consisting of a complex network of water passageways).  Inside the sponge, on the interior surfaces of the passageways, are specialized cells called choanocytes (collar cells), each of which has a flagellum surrounded by a ring of shorter finger-like appendages (the \"collar\") which help to trap food particles.  The flagella, which are tiny beating hairs, create water movement inside the sponge.  Water is drawn in through very tiny pores in the sponge's surface (these pores are called ostia and are too small to be seen in this video), into the internal passageways.  In a complex sponge such as this (sponges with this basic body organization with branching complex systems of water passages are called leuconoid sponges) these passageways merge into larger and larger passageways which ultimately terminate in large openings called oscula, through which the water exits the body.  \n\nThe water flowing through the body of a sponge brings the sponge oxygen and carries away carbon dioxide and other wastes.  The water flow also brings food particles.  Food for sponges typically consists of very tiny organisms such as bacteria, other extremely small particles.  Food particles can be trapped by any cell in a sponge, and once trapped the particles (if they are suitable for consumption) are engulfed into food vacuoles via phagocytosis.\n\nAt first glance sponges look like they sit passively and do nothing all day, but as you can see in this video nothing could be farther from the truth.  They expend a large amount of energy pumping water through themselves. and though they don't get up and walk or swim around like you expect an animal to do, they are actually quite busy creatures!\n\nSponges can be found in both freshwater and saltwater, but they are particularly abundant and diverse in the ocean.  In the ocean, sponges of varying sizes, shapes, and colors are tremendously abundant, being found almost anywhere where there are solid surfaces for them to attach to (and some species can even be found in areas with soft seafloors).  They are very important, influential parts of marine (saltwater) ecosystems.", "title": "Sponge Waterflow", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T01:54:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7UsQFHEKNw", "description": "Treze\u015fte multe amintiri pl\u0103cute din vara lui 2001...", "title": "[Class - Te visez mereu]", "publishedDate": "2007-01-25T20:41:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7UwlRPnxcY", "description": "1.

It is also known by the other names such as Blue Mormon, Lemon Pansy or Bharangi. The flowers are white, purple or blue, butterfly shaped (pterygoid) with glittering blue stamens and style standing out in a smooth curve. Branchlets are densely yellow pubescent especially on nodes when young, becoming dark brown to gray-yellow and glabrous. Leaves opposite or in threes; petiole to 5 cm or leaf sub sessile; leaf blade oblong, obovate-oblong, elliptic, or ovate, 6-30 2.5-11 cm, papery, pubescent, margin sub entire to serrulate or sparsely coarse serrate, apex acuminate to acute; veins 10 or 11 pairs, abaxially prominent. Inflorescences are terminal thyrsus, densely yellow-brown hairy. Bracts are sessile, ovate to broadly ovate, 1.5-4.5 0.5-1.8 cm. Flowers white, bluish, or purplish, tube 7 mm. Petals oblong to obovate, 6-12 mm. Stamens 2-4 cm long, protruding out. The Style is long protruding and its Drupes are green when young, becoming black, spherical. It is used as a common herb for treating common cold, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, cough and other chronic respiratory problems. It is also used by Ayurveda for relief from fever and hyper-pyrexia. Bharangi has been investigated for its antipyretic and antihistamine activities.\n\nKas/Kaas Plateau is a lateritic soil plateau on the ridge of North Western Ghats of India located to the west of Satara, Maharashtra. Kas plateau has only a shallow upper layer soil in scattered depressions and composed of exposed porous soft rock. The plateau is filled with small rivulets and ponds. The origin of its name 'Kaas' is still unclear yet this was once home to 'kaasa' plants Elaeocarpus. Probably the place got its name from the 'Kaasa' plant. Kas Plateau is recently recognised by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site.  The flora on Kas plateau consists of herbaceous plants many of them being ephemerals dotted with clumps of shrubs, memecylon being the dominant species. The floral extravaganza at Kas begins with the advent of North West monsoon. The spectacle of Kas flowers has been unfolding each year after surviving through annual grazing and burning, yet Kas is threatened by the insurgence of thousands of visitors thronging the plateau on peak flowering days.\n\nSatara is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India. The town is 2320 ft. above sea-level, near the confluence of the Krishna and its tributary river Venna. The city was the capital of the Maratha empire in the 17th century, hence one of the historical cities of Maharashtra. This city is the capital of Satara Tehsil, as well as Satara District.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

For a World Series that was projected to be thisclose \u2014 and let's face it, it probably still will be \u2014 Game 1 was less a George Clooney thriller than a George Carlin laugher, at least for the Red Sox.\nThree runs in the first inning, two more in the second, a David Ortiz home run for good measure in the seventh, uncharacteristically poor defense by the St. Louis Cardinals and one potentially devastating injury, and it all added up to an 8-1 Sox rout at jam-packed Fenway Park.\nIf not for having to talk crew chief John Hirschbeck into reversing a blown call by second base umpire Dana DeMuth in the first inning, manager John Farrell could've hit the snooze button and slept right through it.\n\"I wouldn't say everything went right,\" catcher David Ross said, smiling before setting up the punch line. \"I was trying to hit a homer a couple times, and it didn't happen.\"\nAnd so, the Red Sox are three victories from destiny, to say nothing of the Duck Boats and another rolling rally, and have won nine consecutive World Series games, dating to their 2004 sweep of the Cardinals.\nJust don't expect them to get ahead of themselves.\n\"It's a smidge of momentum,\" left fielder Jonny Gomes said. \"But at the same time, as soon as we walk out these double doors, we've got to clear the slate and just play (tonight) as if it's 0-0.\"\nBut this one stung for the Cardinals, who lost right fielder Carlos Beltran to bruised ribs on his right side only two innings into his first World Series. Ironically, the injury occurred when he reached over the low right field wall in the second inning to make a sensational steal of a grand slam by Ortiz.\nOne inning later, Beltran was out of the game and on his way to Mass General Hospital for X-rays and a CT scan that came back negative. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny labeled Beltran \"day to day.\"\nEven Beltran wouldn't have made much of a difference. Not with the way Red Sox starter Jon Lester was throwing. By the time Beltran exited, the Red Sox were leading 5-0, and Lester mowed down the Cardinals for 72\u20443 innings, allowing only five hits and striking out eight with a dizzying array of fastballs and cutters.\n\"I mean, his pitching is absolutely incredible,\" Gomes said. \"He's got to be climbing the ranks of left-handed starters in the game. Great season. Playoffs, he's a beast, man. The way he's toeing that rubber \u2014 Game 1 of all three (series), it speaks miles about him. He did a great job.\"\nIt was a mismatch from the start, with the Red Sox taking advantage of every Cardinals mistake and jumping on ace Adam Wainwright, who needed 31 pitches just to get through the first inning.\nThe turning point came early. With two on and one out, Ortiz rolled a grounder that could have resulted in a double play. Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma, known for his stellar defense, missed the feed from second baseman Matt Carpenter, although DeMuth initially ruled that he dropped the ball on the transfer and called runner Dustin Pedroia out.\nFarrell burst from the dugout to protest, and after the umpires conferred, the call was reversed.", "title": "Jon Lester,  Cardinals Errors  Help Red Sox To Laugher", "publishedDate": "2013-10-24T10:20:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7lxd7RL1To", "description": "2014 US TOUR\n\n04/01 BOSTON\n04/02 NYC\n04/03 PONTIAC\n04/04 CHICAGO\n04/05 MINNEAPOLIS\n04/07 ENGLEWOOD\n04/08 SALT LAKE CITY\n04/10 SANTA CRUZ\n04/11 COACHELLA\n04/12 SAN FRANCISCO\n04/14 VANCOUVER\n04/15 SEATTLE\n04/16 PORTLAND\n04/18 COACHELLA\n04/19 SOLANA BEACH\n\nTickets & Informations: https://www.facebook.com/CaravanPalace/app_123966167614127\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\"PANIC\" - New Album Available : http://smarturl.it/CPPanic -\n\n\nFind us on facebook : http://www.facebook.com/CaravanPalace -\nhttp://www.caravanpalace.com/ -\nhttps://twitter.com/caravan_palace -\n \n(P) & \u00a9 2012 Le Caf\u00e9 De La Danse / Wagram Label / Wagram Music \nDirected By Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Ponchara", "title": "Caravan Palace - Dramophone [OFFICIAL VIDEO]", "publishedDate": "2012-10-23T15:56:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "A7m7edYSqxU", "description": "Welcome to my video for Tearaway on the Sony Playstation Vita (PS VITA).

We're going to take off the suckers. Now, how do you identify a sucker? Well, first you look for a leaf, and then above that at a forty-five degree angle there may be a feathery-looking thing coming out. That is a sucker. And, the more suckers you take off, the larger your tomatoes that are left on the vine will get. So, I take off all but one sucker on most of my tomato plants. Except for Brandywine and Cherry Tomatoes. Those I only allow maybe two or three suckers. And, the reason I take off all these suckers is to help to give the plant more energy to put toward fruit production, rather than green gross production. Because, these suckers, all they do is produce more and more leafy material and, correspondingly, less tomato actual production. \n\nWell, the most important thing to do is to take the suckers off, but sometimes I take off the leaves if they look diseased or turning into blight. What you have to remember, though, is to leave on the plant enough leaves to shade the tomatoes, because don't like to be out in full sun, they get a thing called Sun Scald. So, it's okay to remove some leaves as long as you leave enough that the tomatoes are in shade. The plant will produce clusters off of the main stem, and the first fruiting clusters usually are at somewhere between a foot, a foot and a half up on the main stem. And then, the main stem will keep producing fruiting clusters off of it, and the first sucker that you allowed to stay on will get just as big and produce fruiting clusters off of it. And, each stem will provide a nice amount of tomatoes, except for Brandywine and that's why you allow three or four suckers to stay on the plant. They all get about the same size as the main leader until you don't know which one was the main leader anymore.", "title": "How to Prune Tomato Plants?", "publishedDate": "2011-07-14T07:29:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "A818hq_06bk", "description": "This video shows you how to say Granulocyte\u2015Macrophage Colony\u2015Stimulating Factor.\n\nHow would you pronounce Granulocyte\u2015Macrophage Colony\u2015Stimulating Factor?", "title": "Pronounce Medical Words \u2015 Granulocyte\u2015Macrophage Colony\u2015Stimulating Factor", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T05:24:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "A81XNrJHqMg", "description": "Hey all!!!

They do this for exercise and to sharpen their defensive skills for survival. The chicks need to be comfortable with their environment to dance and it's so much fun watching them.\n\nI'm raising two ostrich chicks as pets, along with two emu chicks. All four are in the house right now to keep them safe and warm. The ostrich are about eight weeks old and the emu are two weeks. They'll be moved outside once they're sturdy enough to withstand the outdoors. For more information on them check out my ostrich vlog under video responses.\n\nThey're the biggest bird on the planet, but they have to start somewhere. These tiny adorable chicks will grow up to be up to 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds. With spots and stripes and porcupine like backs they don't look much like the adults they become, but who can complain? Their too cute for words.\n\nThey hail from Africa and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, including extreme heat. Because they're from the desert ostriches are okay with losing up to 25% of their body weight to dehydration before becoming ill. In fact, their Latin name is Struthio camelus, after the camel. Ostriches do not bury their head in the sand, instead when threatened they run- up to 45 miles per hour. Failing that they deliver a powerful forward kick that can easily kill a lion.", "title": "Baby Ostrich dance party", "publishedDate": "2013-07-15T19:12:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "A84VJ85KFS8", "description": "Panthelogy?

A mysterious force blocks the TARDIS - with Amy inside it - from landing, keeping it stuck in a materialisation loop. It's up to the Doctor to work out what that force is, lest Amy be lost forever along with his home.

To solve this mystery, the Doctor must pass himself off as a normal human and share a flat with Craig Owens. I do not own the clips they belong to the BBC.

The corn snake I'm buying is young, and relatively small. So in this video, I will be using a 10 gallon tank with a glass bottom. However, if you're adopting a juvenile or adult corn snake, you will need at least a 20 gallon tank or terrarium. As with any reptile, I strongly recommend buying a tank with a lid that is secure. Reptiles, especially snakes, are excellent escape artists.  \n\nNext, we want to pick a heating method. All reptiles need a heat source to regulate their body's temperature, facilitate appetite and digest food. Since corn snakes are nocturnal and typically do not appreciate bright lighting, I will be using a heating pad. Heading pads should always be applied to the bottom of the tank on the outside. Many people use overhead lights to provide heat, which is a decent alternative, but lights use more energy, bulbs need to be replaced a couple times a year, and they tend to negatively effect humidity levels inside the tank. The end of the cage with the heating pad will act as a warm spot for the snake and should maintain a temperature between 80 to 85 degrees. The opposite end of the cage should have no heating apparatus and therefore be about 10 degrees cooler. \n\nNext, we must pick a substrate to use as bedding. I chose aspen bedding because it's available at most pet stores, it's inexpensive, and is visually appealing. Aspen bedding is also a great buffer and helps to regulate the temperature of the warm side of the cage by simply adding or subtracting the amount of bedding between the bottom of the tank where the heating pad is located. I typically place paper towels down first for easy removal later, then put down 2 to 3 inches of bedding on the bottom of the tank. You should completely replace the bedding every month to ensure sanitary conditions. \n\nSnakes love to feel secure. So, providing a few places for your corn snake to hide will reduce any stress and they'll be much happier. Place one hide directly over the heating pad inside the cage and place another on the opposite end. This will provide your corn snake a safe place to relax whether it wants to be in a warm or cool environment.  Also, place a water dish in the cage. A water dish is essential for hydration, acts as a bath, and helps to maintain proper humidity levels. \n\nHumidity regulation is just as essential as temperature regulation when housing reptiles. Make sure you have a spray bottle handy and a humidity gauge inside the tank. Corn snakes are comfortable in 30 to 60% humidity and the inside of the cage will need to be sprayed a couple times a day. You will also need 2 thermometers. Place one near the hide on the warm side and the other near the hide on the cooler side. Since we are using a heating pad, leaving the gauges on the aspen bedding will give a more accurate temperature reading compared to sticking the gauges to the walls of the tank. \n\nLastly, I highly recommend setting up the cage before you bring your corn snake home. It gives you time to monitor the temperature and humidity levels in order to make the necessary adjustments. \n\nI bought all supplies at PetSmart. They had good prices and a decent selection of products. However, I do not recommend purchasing a reptile from a large chain pet store like PetSmart or Petco. Always buy a quality animal from a specialty pet shop, breeder, or at a reptile expo. I bought my corn snake at Zoo Creatures in Plaistow, NH, which is also home to the New England Reptile Distributors, also commonly known as NERD. \n\nIf you have any questions or suggest, please comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. I will be picking up my new corn snake in a few days, and will be posting a video of the snake shortly.", "title": "TUTORIAL: Simple and Easy Setup for Corn Snake", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T02:44:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8CWV0Iexnw", "description": "BELUGA / WHITE WHALE \n(Delphinopterus leucas, Pallas 1776) \nMonodontidae / Cetacea / Mammalia\nHabitat: Artic Sea\nMild Threatened Condition \n\nMYSTIC AQUARIUM - MYSTIC; CT; USA \n04/15/2014\n\nvideo by Rogerio Favilla", "title": "BELUGA (Delphinoptera leuca) - MYSTIC AQUARIUM - MYSTIC; CT; USA - video by Rogerio Favilla0", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T16:42:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8CxDeffTTI", "description": "\"A Healthy Mouth Is A Healthy You\"", "title": "Sinusitis Or Toothache?", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T23:49:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8DAeTlJDZ4", "description": "Nouvelle intro pour mes video", "title": "Mon intro", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T13:50:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8DC6NPFgSk", "description": "", "title": "Bird Cage for sale", "publishedDate": "2010-12-03T02:20:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8DrH9rUsd0", "description": "Chlorella is the poor mans version of a great heavy metal detoxer!\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.stephanieperson.com\nFB: stephanie \"the business\" person", "title": "KETOGENIC DIET: to keto adapt smoothy get out the heavy metals!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-08T02:22:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8E5p72L9Mo", "description": "Valdis Story: Abyssal City consigui\u00f3 gracias al portal de financiaci\u00f3n colectiva Kickstarter su objetivo y ahora anuncia que ya est\u00e1 disponible la demo para su descarga.\n\nEnlace: \n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/ecbvn6x2ahif3cy/Valdis_Story_AC_Demo.exe\n\nVisita: http://www.egam3rs.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/egam3rs \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/egam3rs\n\n\nTags: \"espa\u00f1a\"  \"Spanish\" \"castellano\" \"eGAM3Rs\" \"comunidad\" \"videojuegos\" \"portal\" \"videos\" \"Gameplay\"", "title": "Valdis Story: Abyssal City Gameplay Trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-07-08T14:50:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8EULOwr9CI", "description": "How To Train your Dragons 2 in cinemas July 11.\nBook Tickets: https://howtotrainyourdragon2.foxfilmbookings.com/\n\nThe thrilling second chapter of the epic HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON trilogy brings us back to the fantastical world of Hiccup and Toothless five years after the two have successfully united dragons and vikings on the island of Berk.

The pictures were taken in Deventer,Alkmaar, Dordrecht, Middelburg, Monnickendam, Doesburg and many other cities.\n\nA Stepped gable, Crow-stepped gable, or Corbie step is a stair-step type of design at the top of the triangular gable-end of a building.\n\nThe top of the parapet wall projects above the roofline and the top of the brick or stone wall is stacked in a step pattern above the roof as a decoration and as a convenient way to finish the brick courses.\n\nEarly examples, from the 15th century onwards, are found in England, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden. Crow-stepped gables were also used in Scotland as early as the 16th century.\n\nExamples of Scottish crow-stepped gable can be seen at Muchalls Castle, Monboddo House, and theStonehaven Tolbooth, all late 16th and early 17th century buildings.\n\nCrow-stepped gables are also common on Danish medieval churches.\n\nIn the Dutch language, this design is termed trapgevel or \"stair-step gable\", characteristic of many brick buildings in the Netherlands, Belgium, and in Dutch colonial settlements.\n\n19th century examples are found in North America, and the step gable is also a feature of the northern-renaissance revivalstyles.\n\nAbout scleroderma:\n\nhttp://sclerodermie-scleroderma.blogspot.com/\n\nBlog Cuba, Egypt, France, Italy and the Netherlands can be found at:\n\nhttp://travel-experiences-of-xandra.blogspot.com/\n\nAll about dollhouses and miniatures can be found at:\n\nhttp://dollhouses-and-miniatures.blogspot.com/\n\nOver sclerodermie:\n\nhttp://sclerodermie-scleroderma.blogspot.com/\n\nArtikelen over Cuba, Egypte, Frankrijk, Itali\u00eb en Nederland zijn te vinden op: \n\nhttp://travel-experiences-of-xandra.blogspot.com/\n\nAlles over poppenhuizen en miniaturen vind je op:\n\nhttp://dollhouses-and-miniatures.blogspot.com/\n\nVandaag is het onderwerp van mijn foto`s trapgevels.

It was founded in 1919. It was used in part as the winter quarters for circus animals. Long after WWII, when Ji\u0159\u00ed Badalec was appointed the director, an essential modernization of the garden started. \n\nLiberec is situated in a river basin between the Jizera Mountains and the Je\u0161t\u011bd Ridge, with the Nisa river winding throught it. The town hall is 373 metres above sea level. The city has a population of 100.000 inhabitants occupying an area of nearly 15 square km. \n\nThe zoo breeds more than 170 species with an overall number of 1000 individuals. More than 500 animals are registered in different European conservation programmes as EEP, ESB and RDB. These national programmes try to save species facing extinction. The treaty CITES concerning the international market of endangered species has the same aim. (by ZOO Liberec)\n---\nThe takin, also called cattle chamois or gnu goat, is a goat-antelope found in the eastern Himalayas. The four subspecies are: B. taxicolor taxicolor, the Mishmi Takin; B. taxicolor bedfordi, the Shaanxi or golden takin; B. t. tibetana, the Tibetan or Sichuan takin; and B. t. whitei, the Bhutan takin. Mitochondrial research shows the takin are related to sheep; its similarity to the muskox is an example of convergent evolution. The takin is the national animal of Bhutan.\n\nThe nyala (Nyala angasii or Tragelaphus angasii), also called inyala, is a spiral-horned antelope native to southern Africa. It is a species of the family Bovidae and genus Nyala, also considered to be in the genus Tragelaphus. It was first described in 1849 by George French Angas. The body length is 135--195 cm (53--77 in), and it weighs 55--140 kg (121--309 lb). The coat is rusty or rufous brown in females and juveniles, but grows a dark brown or slate grey, often tinged with blue, in adult males. Females and young males have ten or more white stripes on their sides. Only males have horns, 60--83 cm (24--33 in) long and yellow-tipped. It exhibits the highest sexual dimorphism among the spiral-horned antelopes.

Nonetheless, we know that if the cause is pregnancy, the cure is delivery. This can be more complicated if you develop it preterm and you mentioned--- it sounds like with some of your pregnancies, you did develop it preterm. But you're able to carry your babies to full term, so that's good. Whether or not you're going to get it again, that's a great question. It depends on a few different factors. Mostly, it depends on the severity of the case and how early you started to develop it. Overall, a woman who's had preeclampsia in the past has a seven-fold chance of having it on her next pregnancy. But, again, it depends on how severe it was and how early it hit. So studies have shown that women who develop a severe case in their second trimester have a 20-65% chance of getting it the second time or with subsequent pregnancies. But women who just had a mild case of it only have a 5-7% chance of developing it again. Now, there are certain things that can increase your chances. These things are your weight before you get pregnant-- for example, any woman who has a BMI greater than 26 going into pregnancy has a higher risk of developing preeclampsia. A woman who has chronic high blood pressure has a higher chance. These are actually things that you can modify and control. You can go into your next pregnancy making sure that you're at a healthy weight. Eat good food, exercise, and do what you can to control your blood pressure. Those are the only things within your power. Other than that, there's not really anything you can do to prevent it. My recommendation to you going into your next pregnancy would be to talk to your doctor. They know the specifics of your past history and they may have more recommendations based on that. My guess is they're going to be more vigilant in watching you this time for symptoms of it and if they start to develop, they'll do all the same testing that they've done in the past and then decide when it's time for you to deliver. You did mention that you want to have a natural birth this time. That's totally, 100% fine, except for some times, there are indications for having an epidural. If it's best for you or the baby, then the nurses and doctors that are taking care of you can give you guidance on that based on the circumstances of your individual situation. For example, if you have severe preeclampsia, then everyone might feel a little more comfortable with you having an epidural because it can affect things actually in a good way. It can reduce your blood pressure temporarily. It's not a cure for the problem, it's more just like a band-aid. It gets your blood pressure to run a little bit lower during labor and can reduce your chances of having complications like seizure and those sorts of things just because it helps control your blood pressure a little bit better. Also, your risk for C-section might be a little bit higher in case you had a seizure or something like that. Having an epidural already in place can be more beneficial to you and your baby. Again, these are all things that you should discuss with your doctor going into your next pregnancy.

Subscribe by clicking here: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\n\nThere is no way that James Bond could shoot a gun, not to mention stir a cocktail. The spy's hand tremors, resulting from excessive alcohol consumption, would prevent him from performing even simple activities. In short, you would never want to put the fate of the world in the hands of a man who consumed over four times the recommended amount of alcohol. \n\nIf you took 007 to bed with you, you would be similarly disappointed, as Ian Fleming's character is at high risk for sexual dysfunction, along with a long assortment of alcohol-related diseases that will eventually kill him at the age of 56. \n\nA medical analysis of James Bond, based on a study of his drinking habits from all 14 Bond novels, was recently published in the British journal BMJ. \n\nThe authors of the study challenge the notion that James Bond is to be seen as a strong role model, \"someone admired for his performance under pressure and his ability to be master of all situations he encounters.\"\n\nDrinking is his undoing. Indeed, for someone with such an impeccable etiquette, he makes the most elementary mistake when it comes to ordering a martini: shaken, not stirred. \n\nA separate analysis of the fictional spy was conveyed to Big Think by Kevin Dutton, author of The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success. Dutton, a psychologist, doesn't exactly view Bond as a role model either. And yet, Dutton finds something else in Bond's psyche that he argues, counterintuitively, is of great social value.\n\nBond is \"absolutely one of the classic examples of a functional psychopath,\" Dutton says. He possesses characteristics that can be used to \"benefit society rather than detract from society.\"\n\nIt is Bond's lack of conscience and remorse that society ought to value the most, as we need people like that to do our dirty work. For instance, a member of the special forces can't dwell on killing a person, Dutton points out. If you do, Dutton says, \"then the next bullet could be going through your head.\"\n\nSo it is Bond's emotional detachment that suits him so well as a spy. And that is why we would want to put his psychopathic personality, if not his shaky hand, on the line to save us all. \n\n\n\nTranscript: I've been running a survey over these past couple of months actually.  And I've been giving out a special psychometrically validated questionnaire, which tests the presence of psychopathic traits within members of the general population.  I've been giving it out to friends of mine who are film critics actually.  And I've been asking them to rate various iconic figures in film for where they fall on various characteristics.\n \nAnd if we take say the iconic spy figure, James Bond, the British secret service agent, 007 himself, you find that James Bond is probably one of the most nailed down, functional, psychopaths that there is.  I mean, James Bond is ruthless, he's fearless, he's extremely focused, he's mentally tough.  He's, of course, absolutely without conscience and remorse.  He's one of the biggest philanders that's ever worked for the British secret service.  Although, I couldn't say that hand on heart officially.  But I do know some of them.\n \nBut James Bond is absolutely one of the classic examples of a functional psychopath.  Those characteristics are being used to benefit society rather than detract from society.  I've interviewed a lot of Special Forces soldiers and in Special Forces you can't afford to dwell on the fact that you've pulled the trigger and killed someone.  If you do, then the next bullet could be going through your head.  So you have to be very emotionally detached in kind of professions like that.\n \nI think it was writer George Orwell once wrote that good men sleep soundly in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.  And I think this is exactly why we need figures such as James Bond who with a bit of poetic license do exist in real life.  And why we need certain Special Forces troops as well.\n\n\n\nDirected/Produced by Jonathan Fowler, Elizabeth Rodd, and Dillon Fitton", "title": "Kevin Dutton: A Psychological Analysis of James Bond", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T18:42:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8muSyXte7E", "description": "Guy Fawkes night fireworks display at Caerphilly Castle on November 5th 2011.\nThe event is put on by Caerphilly Town Council and is free to attend and there is a collection each year for charity; this year's being St David's Hospice and Caerphilly Lions Club.\n\nMusic: Tchaikovski: 1812 Overture, Op. 49\nCleveland Orchestra conducted by Artur Rodzinski\nColumbia 78rpm Set X-MX-205.

It's about the size of a baked potato, so it fits very neatly into the palm of your hand. \n\nBut what really captures peoples' imaginations is its nose itself. It looks like a sea anemone; tt looks like a starfish. The New York Times described it as \"raw hamburger being put through a meat grinder.\"\n\nIt does a couple of things that are pretty amazing. Most people think it uses that sea anemone thing on its nose as a way to smell the world, which they've discovered is not the case. It actually is this touch-sensing organ. The other really cool thing about it is recently it's been shown that it's the only mammal to actually be able to smell underwater. What it does is it sends out these bubbles and inhales at lightening speeds. The bubbles catch odor molecules underwater and as the animal inhales, it is able to sense food in its environment underwater. (Note: follow this link to see this behavior in action: http://youtu.be/7VD294VYAVg )\n\nMost people look at adaptations that organisms make to their environments as an opportunity for getting inspiration to solve their own problems. I think sometimes what we forget is that a lot of these organisms provide us with opportunities for wonder that's just as important as solving some of our critical challenges.\n\nSo can we learn some amazing things from the sensory apparatus of the star nosed mole's nose? Probably... or undoubtedly. But at the same time, the fact that this tiny, potato sized animal has developed this extraordinary way of navigating its world, is just a cause for wonder and a cause for celebration. And it's worth it just for that.\"", "title": "AskNature Nugget Ep. 9: Star-Nosed Mole", "publishedDate": "2012-08-02T19:12:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8oI4pfP4go", "description": "Israel / Jerusalem\n\nTime-lapse footage of The Tomb of Christ (and surroundings), from within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nPlease see http://israelfootage.com for more.", "title": "The Edicule / Tomb of Christ (Church of the Holy Sepulchre - Jerusalem)", "publishedDate": "2011-01-15T01:55:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8oaPRA9iYA", "description": "Daddy Noisemaker - Different Dimensions // German Hardstyle\n\nDaddy Noisemaker:\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/daddynoisemaker\n\nThe Magic Tunes on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/themagictunes\n\n-", "title": "Daddy Noisemaker - Different Dimensions", "publishedDate": "2011-04-17T13:01:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8oswQHw-c0", "description": "The Mile High Warp (Mashup) Download Link: \nhttp://soundcloud.com/user3454489/the-mile-high-warp-mashup-dj \nno copyright infringement intended rights belong to basic physics, steve aoki, funk d", "title": "The Mile High Warp (Mashup) - DJ Froyo", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T21:30:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8p-CYk7lwQ", "description": "Theory-Around-Skyword\n\n\u266aThe Re-coming - Guilty Gear 2 Overture\n\nreplay DL\u2192 http://www.mediafire.com/?jklu5dp0y6cbb49\nUnedited Ver.(60fps) \u2192 http://db.tt/GY3q8Apt\n\nPrevious \u2192 http://youtu.be/nVD2WPOfYGQ\nNext \u2192 http://youtu.be/cbkHBCGaBf4\n\nNG movie \u2192 http://youtu.be/UkTxfbRdcRg", "title": "[SSBB]Snake(red) vs. MetaKnight(white)[TAS]", "publishedDate": "2011-12-31T16:16:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8p-hqS8IWQ", "description": "European scientists threw their arms up in celebration as a probe delivered by the Rosetta spacecraft landed on the surface of a comet, the climax of a decade-long project to unlock some of the secrets of the universe.

The lyrics come from \"Defence of Fort McHenry\", a poem written in 1814 by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy ships in Chesapeake Bay during the Battle of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \"The Anacreontic Song\" (or \"To Anacreon in Heaven\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it would soon become a well-known American patriotic song. With a range (tessitura) of one and a half octaves, it is known for being difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was recognized for official use by the Navy in 1889, and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover.\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom. \"Hail, Columbia\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\", whose melody is identical to \"God Save the Queen\", the British national anthem, also served as a de facto anthem. Following the War of 1812 and subsequent American wars, other songs would emerge to compete for popularity at public events, among them \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".", "title": "John Stafford Smith - The Star-Spangled Banner", "publishedDate": "2013-02-04T19:28:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8ztPMK4M7M", "description": "Hymne UNAI di sesi final lomba paduan suara kopertis IV. so proud to be UNAI-ers! :)", "title": "Hymne UNAI - Gloria Festiva", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T13:27:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "A8zuvSa0IlM", "description": "", "title": "Christella Esperance", "publishedDate": "2011-08-04T14:00:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "A9-Rfc9bdMg", "description": "Ver descripci\u00f3n en http://www.avespampeanas.com.ar/Html/Loica-Comun.html", "title": "Loica Com\u00fan (Sturnella loyca)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-24T00:29:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "A9-XK9M60ek", "description": "pepas.ru \n\u0412\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0444\u043b\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043d\u0442\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b.", "title": "Passiflora edulis", "publishedDate": "2012-09-09T19:17:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "A9-eb68ca68", "description": "FIFA Online 3 Celebrations Tutorial - Finish Style\n\u261e Update: 22/05/2014\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u261e For more videos: http://full.sc/Z7IiOV\n\u261e Subscribe: http://full.sc/1qzfnMP\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nUpgrade +5 World XI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRTCEVrLlYE", "title": "FIFA Online 3 \u25ba Celebrations Tutorial - \u0102n m\u1eebng b\u00e0n th\u1eafng", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T07:15:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "A9-s1X8kHYk", "description": "Prod.

It is the most important of the four sites in India's Char Dham pilgrimage. The town gets its name from the Holy temple of Badrinath. \nThe tragedy in Uttarakhand is unfolding as the death toll in the flash floods and landslides continues. Over 550 people have been killed and thousands still remain stranded in different parts of the state.\nHowever, authorities are also saying that it is still difficult to put a number to those dead or those who may have been stranded. The government has already warned that the body count could rise dramatically as flood waters recede and rescue workers reach isolated areas.\nThe Army has confirmed that although 18,000 people were rescued by road and almost 1,300 by Army and private helicopters from various areas around Uttarkashi, thousands still remain trapped. A helipad has been constructed near the Kedarnath temple and rescue operations will continue on Saturday while Navy divers have been deployed as well.\n[source-http://ibnlive.in.com/news/uttarakhand-floods-over-550-dead-thousands-cry-for-help-in-badrinath/400773-3.html]\n[Source-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badrinath]", "title": "Uttarakhand Disaster - Badrinath Kedarnath Guptkashi flooded - 1000 of thousands died", "publishedDate": "2013-06-24T08:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "A930NaztsJU", "description": "Self explanatory.", "title": "Torrie Bronco Buster", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T05:12:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "A93g3xe9EqU", "description": "I have developed a piece of equipment for paralyzed patients have contractures of the fingers.\nIts name is MPSG ( Masanori Pre-Shaping Glove )\n\n Patents pending.\n\nPlease question.\n\n\u8133\u5352\u4e2d\u5f8c\u907a\u75c7\u7247\u30de\u30d2\u60a3\u8005\u3055\u3093\u306a\u3069\u3001\u624b\u6307\u306e\u62d8\u7e2e\u3092\u5448\u3057\u305f\u65b9\u306b\n\u7740\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u88c5\u5177\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u88c5\u5177\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f\u3001MPSG\uff08Masanori Pre-Shaping Glove\uff1a\u6a5f\u80fd\u80a2\u4f4d\u4fdd\u6301\u624b\u888b\u88c5\u5177\uff09\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u7279\u8a31\u51fa\u9858\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nmixi\u306b\u65e5\u8a18\u8f09\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u662f\u975e\u3054\u89a7\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\u3002\nhttp://mixi.jp/view_diary.pl?id=1679777490&owner_id=2463538\n\n\u307e\u3060\u8a66\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u4eca\u5f8c\u3001\u696d\u8005\u306b\u983c\u3093\u3067\u88fd\u54c1\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3059\n\n\u3054\u8cea\u554f\u306a\u308a\u4f55\u3067\u3082\u30b3\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u4e0b\u3055\u3044", "title": "\u8133\u5352\u4e2d\u3000\u30ea\u30cf\u30d3\u30ea\uff1aFinger contracture prevention after stroke etc.. : MPSG.wmv", "publishedDate": "2011-02-28T09:10:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "A942-lKZ52o", "description": "Subscribe to the ABS-CBN Online channel! - http://bit.ly/ABSCBNOnline\n\nVisit our official website! \nhttp://www.abs-cbn.com\nhttp://www.push.com.ph\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ABSCBNnetwork\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/ABSCBN\nhttps://twitter.com/abscbndotcom\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/abscbnonline", "title": "Jason Dy sings 'All Of Me' for Sarah G.", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T15:42:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "A943iw_Ypng", "description": "Th\u03b1nks f\u03c3r w\u03b1tch\u00edng\nsu\u0432scr\u00ed\u0432\u0454 f\u03c3r m\u03c3r\u0454", "title": "Verbascum", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T19:43:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "A94gQ9PvAYg", "description": "Electrical safety check from local Winchester electrician - Earthing and bonding\nMichael Footer from All Safe Electric explains the importance of Earthing and bonding and what it is.", "title": "Winchester electrician gives electrical safety check advice - Earthing and bonding", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T19:19:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "A95IE-ED6Cg", "description": "", "title": "BUSINESS FRENCH =  promulgation, enactment", "publishedDate": "2011-03-25T09:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "A95cnSmozW8", "description": "Zidane and Co. try to escape from the forest, but OH NOES Blank doesn't make it!!1", "title": "Final Fantasy IX - The Petrification Of Blank", "publishedDate": "2007-07-25T02:17:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "A96-KmGOkV8", "description": "http://300watches.com/catalog/breguet/transatlantique-titanium-watch.html\n\nThis men's Breguet Type XXI Transatlantique, model 3810TI/H2/TZ9 and reference number 3810, is a new luxury watch.

So, once you apply for the loan and you go through the process of speaking with your mortgage banker and your processor, then all that documentation is going to come to me, and I'm going to analyze your credit history, your income history, all your banking accounts and then based off of all that, we're going to be able to decide if we're going to give you a loan.\n\nMICHAEL: Everyone has a different background as far as their employment.  You may be self-employed, you may have just graduated from college and have started your first job - so everyone is going to be different, everyone is going to have different tax returns. \n\nMICHAEL: If I'm looking at your tax returns and I see that there might be something that wasn't included on the first time, then I would reach out to the processor to reach out to the borrower to make sure that we have that, to get a correct decision on your application. \n\nMICHAEL:  My role is important because it helps to make sure that you can afford the mortgage that you're applying for, and that way, you're not over-straining your family and your bills, and you don't run the risk of any kind of foreclosure or late payments.\n\nMICHAEL: As far as from a lending perspective, my job is to make sure that all the mortgages meet government guidelines.

The Cucurbita genus is an important source of human food and is used for other purposes such as beverages, medicine, oil, and detergent. Some Cucurbita species were brought to Europe after the discovery of America and are now used in many parts of the world. The plants, referred to as squash, pumpkin or gourd depending on species, variety and local parlance, are grown for their edible fruits and seeds. Real, used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita, but in different tribes.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nCucurbita_pepo-2.JPG from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cucurbita_pepo-2.JPG\n\nCucurbita_maxima_Cabaza_GFDL.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gourds_and_squashes\n\nCucurbita_maxima_02_-_Orange.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cucurbita_maxima_02_-_Orange.jpg\n\nCucurbita_pepo_var._styriaca05.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cucurbita_pepo_var._styriaca05.jpg\n\n220px-Cucurbita_2011_G1.jpg from http://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita\n\nCucurbita_moschata_Butternut.png from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cucurbita_moschata_Butternut.png", "title": "All About - Cucurbita", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T04:06:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "A9IrRV2M33o", "description": "This is my \"fast\" rendition of Maple Leaf Rag.

He was influenced by his multicultural parents and the European touch is unmistakable. From Italy he got his unrestrained character, from Mongolia his almond-shaped eyes, from Germany his conscientiousness and from Turkey, his assertiveness. Combined, these qualities create a great foundation for his career. He lives and breathes House Music.\n\nWith his new track White Rabbit - feat. Erin Ragland - DJ Soulstar revives the wild 1960s and brings back the vibe of movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Platoon. But of course not without giving the sound a major Soulstar-treatment: \n\nWhile the Original Mix is a piece of pumping House Music, the Club Mix goes with a more relaxed techy vibe.
