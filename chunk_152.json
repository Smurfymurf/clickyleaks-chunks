It is allowed to remain in contact with the charcoal for about half an hour. At 173K, only argon, krypton and xenon are adsorbed by the charcoal while helium and neon remain unadsorbed. These are pumped out and collected.\n     The mixture of helium and neon is kept in contact with coconut charcoal at 93K which completely adsorbs neon leaving free helium.\n     The charcoal at 173K containing argon, krypton and xenon is placed in contact with another charcoal at the temperature of the liquid air when argon diffuse into the other charcoal.\n     The temperature of the first charcoal (temp.173K) still containing krypton and xenon is raised to 183K when krypton is set free while xenon remain adsorbed in the charcoal. When it is heated, xenon is recovered.\n\nPrayaag Eduserv focuses to bring out educational digital contents in audio visual e-learning format, which is easy to understand and help the student remember as and when required. It relieves the student from cramming, memorizing the school text books.We thereby meet the unmet need of learning the school curriculum in multimedia format which makes the student motivated to learn deeper with ease, instead of learn by route. \n\nOur ultimate vision is to trigger creative imagination of the students to learn the content with enthusiasm. With the above mission in mind, we ventured to create Audio Visual Content for Tamilnadu State Board +2 Science & Mathematics. Each subject is given with animations, graphics, images, videos to help the students understand in a simple way. Number of academic experts who are leaders in the respective subjects worked hours &hours with visual communication technology experts to bring about an excellent collaborativeproject of educational ecosystem to achieve the best exam results. The DVDs are easy to use and hence the students enjoy learning.\n\nWe have included Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) plus solved Board Exam papers.\n\nTo start with, we brought out Physics, Chemistry, Biology &Maths for +2 Tamilnadu State Board Syllabus in English. Soon we will have Physics, Chemistry Biology &Maths for +2 TN State Board Tamil medium students, as well.\n\nThis long journey only just started. Our management is not only focused on the exam results but also on mind development of the students. As we progress we will bring out educational DVD's for +1 and 10th standard students for Tamilnadu State Board.The passion to benefit all the stakeholders including parents, students and teachers, driven us to center our attention on the art and the science of delivering client-delight.\n\nThe unique feature of our DVD content is our natural,easy to understand voiceover which reflects closely the contents as mentioned in the respective text books and also explains the visual images very clearly.\nIt is our endeavor and hope that all our efforts will help the students achieve their Educational Goal and also build job oriented career by preparing the students for engineering and other professional courses.\n\nPlease contact us immediately to get your FREE sample of DVDs.\noperations@prayaageduserv.org \nOr \nsales@prayaageduserv.org", "title": "Separation of noble gases (DEWAR'S METHOD)....Prayaag Educational Services(Prayaag Eduserv)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T06:36:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8a10SdH6EiA", "description": "http://hitachi-id.com\n\nAuthorization process using web approval\n\nContent:\n\n\u2022 An authorizer is invited to review and either approve or reject a change request.\n\u2022 Approvals take place via a secure, authenticated web form.\n\nKey concepts:\n\n\u2022 Multiple authorizers can be invited at the same time.\n\u2022 Approval by N of M people is standard.\n\u2022 Reminders are automatically sent to non-responsive authorizers.\n\u2022 Escalation and delegation can replace non-responsive authorizers.\n\nSee more at: http://hitachi-id.com/identity-manager/overview/onboarding.html", "title": "Authorization process using web approval", "publishedDate": "2014-05-07T21:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8a1Gm8_uNWc", "description": "http://www.tvcnetworks.mx/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/las12casas\nhttp://twitter.com/las12casas", "title": "Oraci\u00f3n para Vender lo que se Quiera (DC)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-25T22:48:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8a1dBo2xUaI", "description": "Chess Tactics Overloading \nOverloading: Damiano defense\n[Mato]\nOverloading is a chess tactic in which a defensive piece is given an additional task which it cannot complete without giving up its original defensive assignment. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5 fxe5 [3...Qe7] 4.Qh5+ Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5 [6...Kg6 7.Qf5+ Kh6 8.d4+ g5 9.h4 d5 10.Qf7 dxc4 11.hxg5#] 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 h6  White has sacrificed to get an attack, but is it good enough?

When you are waxing,\na time to wax is when you want to smooth your dreads out. You definitely\ndon't want . . . not everyone wants nice, neat dreads. You don't want them\nto where they look like just perfect round cylinders. You want a little\nmessiness, you want a little texture to them, because you want them to look\nlike they have their own personality, which is the whole point of wearing\ndreads.\n\nIn the case of waxing, we're just going to even out this dread, just a\nlittle bit. There's definitely nothing wrong with it, but we're just going\nto take some of the frizziness out of the middle part and just smooth it\nall in together. I'm going to use a pomade wax because I want it a little\nthin. I don't need a thick, sticky wax. You also want to look at the\ntexture of your hair and the weight of your hair. Since Aiesha's hair is\nfine but she does have a lot of texture to it, we don't need anything too\nheavy. Because like I said, after a while wax, overtime, will cause a\nbuildup and a residue.\n\nI'm going to get my pomade wax. I'm going to put it in my palm. Because it\nis a pomade, it does have some stick to it. I'm going to leave a little bit\non my fingers and my thumb because that's where I'm going to do my first\npinch at the root. I'm going to go down the whole length of the dread.\nYou'll feel it as it starts soaking in; you feel it even out the texture.\nIt becomes a little more moisturized, a little more oiled. Once you feel\nit, go from the roots to the ends, that when you start palm rolling. We're\ndoing this to smooth out the length of the dread, so we're not palm rolling\nfor the roots; we're mainly rolling for the ends. As I go down, I'm going\nto smooth it out, then palm roll, and twist all the way down.\n\nWaxing can also take some time, because when you do it yourself on your own\nhead, you want to be sure to go through each individual dread. It depends\non how thick and how long your dreads are, but you definitely want to take\nthe time to wax each and every one of them individually. We just gave it a\nsmoother look without changing up the shape too much, but it definitely\nlooks more oiled than the one that isn't.\n\nThat's basic waxing. You just want to smooth out from roots to end. That\nway, you keep your dreads oiled, and nice and uniform.

Did it necessitate that? Was there a need for that to happen?\n\n\"Was there an actual threat on the ground? And that's a concern - that the actual number of forces and the level of force used is disproportionate and it doesn't merit it based on the evidence.\"\n\nLocal shopkeeper Sutha Tangaraj works opposite the house and told Sky News he saw the armed police arrive.\n\n\"At about 7pm or 7:30pm at least half a dozen armed police surrounded the house, they knocked the door and no one answered.\n\n\"A lady in the house eventually opened the door and they went and have since been searching ever since.\"\n\nHe said police were at the same address six months ago.", "title": "4 Muslims arrested in plot to kill Queen Elizabeth", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T17:14:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8aAAE4HbYAs", "description": "Subscribe for new videos every MONDAY! \u25ba http://bit.ly/HPGlol\n\nJirard the Completionist eats a congo trinidad pepper and reviews Super Mario 3D Wo-CHRIST ALMIGHTY\n\nCheck out Jirard's channel\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatOneVideoGamer\nFollow  on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/JKCompletesIt\n\nWatch our last video \u25ba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfGJLzPO6tE\n\nFollow @HotPepperGaming on Twitter \u25ba http://bit.ly/HotPepperTweets\n\nSFX by http://www.freesfx.co.uk/\nMusic: Ideetje by RoccoW - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/RoccoW/~/Ideetje_extended\n\nHot Pepper Game Reviews is your only source on the internet for in-depth game reviews and also hot pepper reviews at the same time.", "title": "Super Mario 3D World - Hot Pepper Game Review feat.

Stay in this position for 30 seconds, and then slowly return to the starting position.

These exercises strengthen the muscles that bring the spine into a forward-bending position.\n\nNumber of repetitions:\nHold in child position for 10 seconds. Slowly return to the starting position, taking around 30 seconds. Repeat 6 times.  \nGradually work toward holding the child position for 30 seconds.

Trawlers drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor, clear-cutting a swath of habitat in their wake. These scars will take centuries to heal. \n\nA bottom trawl consists of a large tapered net with a wide mouth and a small enclosed end. The mouth of a trawl net has two weighted doors that serve not only to keep the net open, but also to keep the net on the ocean floor. These doors can weigh several tons. In addition to the heavy doors, the bottom of the net is a thick metal cable studded with heavy steel balls or rubber bobbins that effectively crush everything in their path. As the net drags along the seafloor, living habitat in its path is crushed, ripped up, or smothered as the seabed is turned over.\n\nhttp://www.savecorals.com/trawling.html", "title": "Video of Trawl Net Scraping the Ocean Floor", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T13:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8aHLJ_AxGtw", "description": "Rising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Treat Her Like A Lady\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Treat Her Like A Lady\n\nOpening Rising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014: http://youtu.be/OU3X4BgwYMY\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Mega Mauro - The Edge Of Glory - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/uW6aj7phzQI\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Mega Mauro - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/RLVbg0hpWEQ\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Hanin Dhiya - Give Your Heart A Break : http://youtu.be/frbxK5GR6a4\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Hanin Dhiya - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/TOfZMMKd2so\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Ghaitsa Kenang - Saat Kau Tak Disini -  Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/fKmlf4RSdrk\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Ghaitsa - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/ZcrGH96rJO0\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Reyna - For Once In My Life - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/uW6aj7phzQI\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Reyna - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/bY3x-qKh2Lg\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - BluesMates - Love Song - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/D76mf9TC-Wk\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk BluesMates - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/SdGgjv1NVBw\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Talita Arsyta - Say My Name - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/tHIHXt5q2og\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Talita - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/0hi_Z9jISvM\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Geisha - Setengah Hatiku Tertinggal - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/KqUBDElrKac\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - CND - Haven't Met You Yet - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/OSMhQ8WievI\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk CND - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/5w2HVubM3iI\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Treat Her Like A Lady : http://youtu.be/8aHLJ_AxGtw\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Indah - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/i-JvAPhQdvY\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014  - Evony Arty - Teristimewa - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/VkUYTh53E10\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Evony - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/jopUIsKr9-w\n\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Sonny Saragih - One Last Breath - Rising Star Indonesia : http://youtu.be/ziKXiBaHpMU\nRising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Komentar Juri Untuk Sonny - Rising Star Indonesia: http://youtu.be/bWsqV3kqWLQ", "title": "Rising Star Indonesia 7 November 2014 - Indah Nevertari - Treat Her Like A Lady", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T18:19:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8aHnKKT1Brw", "description": "comparative #1", "title": "Comparative Essay Writing part I", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T17:06:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8aHyhTVfAe4", "description": "For adolescent patients with Idiopathic scoliosis, rigid thoracic-lumbar bracing is the most widely accepted non-operative treatment to prevent increased spine curvature.

If you have an ink jet printer put he glossy side of the paper into the printer, print the images in reverse and then apply the Liquiskin TM skin adhesive over the sheet of images. ( The ink jet tattoo paper can also be printed by a Laser Printer) Use a ruler over the sheet to smooth out any bubbles\n\nNext cut out tattoos and apply to the skin with sponge and water.\n\nIf you don't have a printer draw your images directly onto the A4 sheet of paper using pens or coloured markers. Wait a few minutes for ink to dry. Be as creative as you want but make sure that the entire A4 sheet is full of images before you apply the Liquiskin TM Skin film adhesive over the top.\n\nThis concept is for fun and the tattoos have a slight shine to it.

It is one of the four sacred months of the year. Since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, Muharram moves from year to year when compared with the Gregorian calendar.\n\nMuharram is so called because it is unlawful to fight during this month, the word is derived from the word haraam, meaning \"sinful\". It is held to be the most sacred of all the months, excluding Ramadan. Some Muslims fast during these days. The tenth day of Muharram is the Day of Ashura, which to Shia Muslims is part of the Mourning of Muharram.\n\nSome Muslims fast during this day, because it is recorded in the hadith[citation needed] that Musa (Moses) and his people obtained a victory over the Egyptian Pharaoh on the 10th day of Muharram; accordingly Islamic prophet Muhammad asked Muslims to fast on this day that is Ashura and on a day before that is 9th so that they are not similar to Jews (since, according to him, Jews used to fast for one day due to the same reason, and many practices recorded in the hadith are specifically performed to avoid any apparent similarity to those of contemporary neighbouring Jews and Christians). Many Muslims cook something sweet like sweet rice and distribute it throughout their family and circle of friends to eat when breaking their fast.\n\nFasting differs among the Muslim groupings; mainstream Shia Muslims stop eating and drinking during sunlight hours and do not eat until late afternoon. Sunni Muslims also fast during Muharram for the first ten days of Muharram, or just the tenth day, or on both the ninth and tenth days; the exact term depending on the individual. Shia Muslims do so to replicate the sufferings of Hussein ibn Ali on the Day of Ashura. Shia Muslims go further in their replication, including self-flagellation.\n\nSaurce: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

This is favorably influenced by rehabilitation. \n\nDiaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. \n\nVon Monakow pointed out that development of diaschisis is enhanced by latent circulatory disorders in both the affected and unaffected areas of the brain.

The Aeroscraft company is seeking funding for its Aeroscraft ML866 model, which will carry 66 tons of payload, and for its Aeroscraft ML868 model carrying 250 tons. A model capable of lifting 500 tons, the Aeroscraft ML86X, is also on the drawing board.\nA scaled-down prototype called the Aeroscraft Pelican\" was completed in January 2013 with funding from the U.S. Department of Defense.\nAccording to the Aeros website, the Aeroscraft ML866 model will be 555 feet (169 m) in length, have a payload capacity of 66 tons, a top speed of 120 knots (222 km/h), a range of 3,100 nautical miles (5,700 km), and a flight ceiling of 12,000 feet (3,700 m). The larger Aeroscraft ML868 model will be 770 feet (230 m) in length and carry 200 tons, with the same speed and altitude ceiling as the Aeroscraft ML866.\nAeroscraft Commercial cargo\n\nIf Aeros is able to successfully fund, build, and operate their Aeroscraft design, an Aeroscraft could be used to transport civilian cargo to remote locations, or to locations with difficult terrain or poor roads. This would take advantage of the Aeroscraft's ability to land on any flat surface, paved or unpaved, and to hover over uneven terrain. The Aeroscraft design also calls for cargo bays that are larger than any current air, truck or rail transport,[1] which may enable the Aeroscraft to compete in the outsize cargo market, moving goods such as wind turbines or large aerospace parts.\n\nThe Aeroscraft manufacturer also envisions commercial use as a cargo carrier which could deliver a large amount of merchandise from a centralized location.\nAeroscraft Military uses\n\nThe Aeroscraft could be used to transport military vehicles or supplies to difficult terrain with no infrastructure, a job currently reserved for helicopters. The Aeroscraft design calls for payload capacities significantly heavier than the current 16-ton maximum for helicopters.\n\nSince many military transport needs involve either broken or unreliable infrastructure during disaster relief or combat, the Aeroscraft's independence from runways or other infrastructure is of interest to the military. The Pentagon has provided $50 million in funding for the development of the Aeroscraft \"Pelican\" prototype\nIn 2005, Aeros was granted the largest contract under DARPA's project Walrus HULA. Project Walrus was not renewed in 2010.[11] However, the Pentagon continued to fund Aeroscraft through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office, contracting with them in 2010 to build a prototype that could demonstrate key technologies.[12] This prototype became known as the Aeroscraft \"Pelican.\"\nAeroscraft Flight testing\n\nThe first floating of the Aeroscraft Pelican occurred on January 3, 2013. It hovered at 12 feet for several minutes in a former military hangar in Tustin, California.[13] The Pentagon has declared that the tests of the Pelican were a \"success\", with the craft meeting its demonstration objectives.[14] The Aeroscraft Pelican was rolled out of its hangar on July 4, 2013.\n\nThe Aeroscraft Pelican is 250 ft long, only half the size of the planned full-scale version, but uses the same structure and avionics.\nAeroscraft Future plans\n\nAeros is currently seeking $3 billion to fund the construction of 24 Aeroscraft vehicles, including the 250-ton capacity Aeroscraft ML868 model. Aeroscraft aim to finish construction in 2016.\nAn airship or dirigible is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that is propelled through the air by engine power. An aerostat stays aloft by having a large \"envelope\" filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity.\n\nBesides the main envelope, an airship also has engines and crew accommodation, typically in a gondola hung beneath the envelope.\n\nThe main types of airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid.[2] Non-rigid airships, often called \"blimps\", rely on internal pressure to maintain the shape of the airship. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer structural framework which maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gas bags or cells.\nhttp://aeroscraft.com/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroscraft", "title": "AEROSCRAFT World's Most Advanced AIRSHIP First Flight Commercial CARJAM TV 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T00:02:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8b-qouJtN5I", "description": "Sleeveless beach robe for kids in absorbent terry towelling.

Open your medicine cabinet and bring out that bottle of Listerine. Since this was first formulated by Dr. Joseph Lawrence and Jordan Wheat Lambert in 1879 as a surgical antiseptic, it has been marketed for numerous health concerns. Besides dentists using it to use in oral health care, in distilled form, it's also was used as a floor clearer as well as a cure for gonorrhea. Over the years, in the mid -1970's it was marketed as a cure for colds and sore throats. Currently, people are using this product for toenail fungus by soaking their foot or feet in it.\n\nHow does it work? Curative properties in this mouthwash include: thymol, an alcohol soluble substance originally used to preserve mummies in Egypt. Eucalyptol is an essential oil made up of eucalyptus oil and known for its antimicrobial properties and it also has the ability to act as an immune system stimulant. In this mouthwash, is salicylate. This is an organic acid that causes a greater amount of dead cells to shed, leaving room for new skin cells to grow.\n\nUsing this for a toenail fungus treatment, you must be persistent. People have claimed the remedy works only after soaking for about thirty minutes per day for a few days. We do live in a fast paced world, but in reality, this remedy may take longer than a couple of days to clear up. Before you run to the doctor and pay high prices for a prescription, visit your local drugstore and purchase a bottle of Listerine (your choice of taste or color), and give your toes a soak. Don't quit after one treatment, continue for at least a week of daily soaks.", "title": "Does Listerine Work On Nail Fungus?

Provision that allows feds to suspend passports of accused tax delinquents expected to pass Congress.\nhttp://www.infowars.com/irs-travel-ban-revoking-citizenship-by-stealth/\nEfforts to pass a bill that would allow the IRS to deny travel rights to U.S. citizens who the feds merely claim owe $50,000 or more in delinquent taxes represents a de facto move to revoke the citizenship of Americans without due process and in complete violation of the Constitution.\n\nThanks to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a recently passed Senate bill, the suitably Orwellian entitled 'Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act', includes a provision that allows the federal government to revoke passports of Americans accused of owing back taxes.\n\nThe legislation now moves to the Congress where, despite a Republican majority, the IRS provision is expected to be retained in the final version of the bill because it will raise an estimated $750 million dollars over ten years.\nhttp://www.opednews.com/articles/Pay-Your-Taxes-Or-Lose-You-by-Jack-Swint-120412-225.html\n\"There is no requirement that the tax payer be guilty of or even charged with tax evasion, fraud, or any criminal offense \u2014 only that the citizen is alleged to owe the IRS back taxes of $50,000 or more,\" reports the Daily Economist.\n\nEmpowering the IRS to deny fundamental rights on a whim is completely illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n\"There are also numerous Supreme Court precedents protecting these same rights,\" writes Jack Swint. \"Furthermore, the law appears to violate Article I, Section 9, paragraph 3 of the United States Constitution, which forbids \"Bills of Attainder\", which are laws providing for the punishment of an individual without benefit of judicial process.\"\n\n\"It takes away your right to enter or exit the country based upon a non-judicial IRS determination that you owe taxes,\" Constitutional Attorney Angel Reyes told FOX Business. \"It's a scary thought that our congressional representatives want to give the IRS the power to detain US citizens over taxes, which could very well be in dispute.\"\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2012/04/05/owe-irs-youre-not-going-anywhere/\nWhat's next? If the feds can bar you from leaving the country merely by claiming you have committed some infraction without having to provide any evidence, the prospect of Americans being abducted and interned indefinitely under the National Defense Authorization Act with a similar absence of due process is just around the corner.\n\n Will citizens have their drivers license cancelled if the state claims they are behind on their property taxes? How about the government working with big banks to suspend credit cards if an individual is accused of avoiding inheritance or capital gains tax? Will similar punitive measures of punishment be enforced for Americans who attempt to avoid mandatory government health care?\n\nPresumably because the provision was introduced by Harry Reid, there is a noticeable absence of uproar from the left even though the bill would achieve in one fell swoop what civil libertarians have fought against during the course of over ten years of the 'war on terror' -- the ability of the federal government to arbitrarily strip Americans of the inherent rights associated with their citizenship status.\n\nWhile U.S. citizens will be treated as guilty until proven innocent with regard to tax delinquency under this bill, individuals and corporations that have avoided hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes continue to escape any scrutiny whatsoever from the IRS.\n\nForget $50,000 dollars, people like Warren Buffett owe nearly one billion dollars in back taxes going back a decade, but I doubt you'll see Buffett being apprehended by the TSA on his next business trip if this bill passes Congress.\nhttp://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/buffett-irs-back-taxes/2011/09/01/id/409520\nThis has nothing to do with cracking down on large scale tax criminals and everything to do with greasing the skids for the federal government to randomly deny Americans the right to mobility, effectively revoking their citizenship, merely on hearsay alone.\n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/\nhttp://www.prisonplanet.tv/\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/RealAlexJones\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerikJones", "title": "IRS To Revoke Citizenship: RED ALERT!", "publishedDate": "2012-04-16T22:29:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8b7x1ubVIYo", "description": "Si sta per concludere la dodicesima edizione del festival \"Blues in Villa\" che si tiene a Brugnera nel Parco di Villa Varda.

Symptoms usually develop 7\u201314 days (average 10\u201312) after exposure to an infected person and the initial symptoms usually include a high fever (often &gt; 40 \u00b0C [104 \u00b0F]), Koplik's spots (spots in the mouth, these usually appear 1\u20132 days prior to the rash and last 3\u20135 days), malaise, loss of appetite, hacking cough (although this may be the last symptom to appear), runny nose and red eyes. After this comes a spot-like rash that covers much of the body. The course of measles, provided there are no complications, such as bacterial infections, usually lasts about 7\u201310 days.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nMorbillivirus_measles_infection.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles\n\nKoplik_spots,_measles_6111_lores.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles\n\nMeasles_virus.JPG from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles\n\nMeasles_and_Scarlet_Fever_(3796080398)_cs.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Measles_and_Scarlet_Fever_(3796080398)_cs.jpg\n\nMeasles_in_African_Child.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Measles_in_African_Child.jpg", "title": "All About - Measles", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T12:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bT01mC9xSA", "description": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/gop-rep-channels-mccarthy_n_135735.html\n\nA campaign to censure Rep. Michelle Bachmann over her remarks has been launched.\n* * *\n\nIn a television appearance that outraged Democrats are already describing as Joseph McCarthy politics, Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann claimed on Friday that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle held anti-American views and couldn't be trusted in the White House. She even called for the major newspapers of the country to investigate other members of Congress to \"find out if they are pro-America or anti-America.\"\n\nAppearing on MSNBC's Hardball, Bachmann went well off the reservation when it comes to leveling political charges against the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"If we look at the collection of friends that Barack Obama has had in his life,\" she said, \"it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs and values and thoughts are.

Meth users report that after taking the drug they experience a sudden \"rush\" of pleasure or a prolonged sense of euphoria, as well as increased energy, focus, confidence, sexual prowess and feelings of desirability. However, after that first try, users require more and more of the drug to get that feeling again, and maintain it. With repeated use, methamphetamine exacts a toll on the mind and body, robbing users of their physical health and cognitive abilities, their libido and good looks, and their ability to experience pleasure. Here's how the body reacts to meth and the consequences of long-term abuse.\nOne of the most striking effects of meth is the change in the physical appearance of meth users. Because meth causes the blood vessels to constrict, it cuts off the steady flow of blood to all parts of the body. Heavy usage can weaken and destroy these vessels, causing tissues to become prone to damage and inhibiting the body's ability to repair itself. Acne appears, sores take longer to heal, and the skin loses its luster and elasticity. Some users are covered in small sores, the result of obsessive skin-picking brought on by the hallucination of having bugs crawling beneath the skin, a disorder known as formication. Meth releases a surge of dopamine, causing an intense rush of pleasure or prolonged sense of euphoria.\n Over time, meth destroys dopamine receptors, making it impossible to feel pleasure. Although these pleasure centers can heal over time, research suggests that damage to users' cognitive abilities may be permanent. Chronic abuse can lead to psychotic behavior, including paranoia, insomnia, anxiety, extreme aggression, delusions and hallucinations, and even death.", "title": "Meth Patrons / Before & After Effects", "publishedDate": "2012-03-08T14:03:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bU95y72UMw", "description": "Steven Gerrard Slips And Costs LFC The Title (Liverpool v Chelsea)", "title": "Steven Gerrard Slips And Costs LFC The Title (Liverpool v Chelsea)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T07:37:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bUtQQTGMfg", "description": "Rhinos sty popped and he's now squeezing the puss out \n\nNarration by Tommy Solace", "title": "Sty n guys eye", "publishedDate": "2011-08-24T07:18:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bUzIlrzLHA", "description": "Music core 20140125\n\nRainbow Blaxx - Cha Cha, \ub808\uc778\ubcf4\uc6b0 \ube14\ub799(\uc7ac\uacbd,\uace0\uc6b0\ub9ac,\uc624\uc2b9\uc544,\ud604\uc601) - \ucc28\ucc28\n\n\u25b6Show Music Core Official Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/mbcmusiccore", "title": "[HOT] Rainbow Blaxx - Cha Cha, \ub808\uc778\ubcf4\uc6b0 \ube14\ub799(\uc7ac\uacbd,\uace0\uc6b0\ub9ac,\uc624\uc2b9\uc544,\ud604\uc601) - \ucc28\ucc28, Show Music core 20140125", "publishedDate": "2014-01-25T08:54:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bVA1MCWgbE", "description": "Learn how to prepare feta cheese for authentic tabbouleh; learn more about traditional Lebanese food in this free cooking video.\n\nExpert: Amy Staggs\nContact: www.myspace.com/amystaggs\nBio: Amy Staggs grew up in Western Pennsylvania, where, at an early age, she learned how to can fruits & vegetables with her mom on her family's farm.\nFilmmaker: Michelle Carter", "title": "How to Make Tabbouleh : Preparing Feta for Tabbouleh", "publishedDate": "2008-02-16T04:48:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bVQoXd_E8A", "description": "Morceau issu de la StreetTape de Nido \"Re/Co/Naissance\" Sortie en 2012 disponible en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur sa page Music :\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Nido.PageOfficiel\nhttps://twitter.com/NidoOfficiel", "title": "NIDO - Rue Gorges Cuvier", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T16:56:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "8bVvAwenjjY", "description": "Evening shot of Khurkhul village, Manipur.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I normally ride a bicycle for 6-10 minutes before \nstarting. Performing a short cardio warm-up before these is optimal.\n\nIt is best to do a dynamic warm-up instead of static stretching prior to a workout's start. Save major static stretching for after the workout is complete. Dynamic warm-ups have been shown to help prevent injury and improve performance.\n\nDynamic warm-ups increase heart rate, create greater range of motion for muscles and joints, increase body temperature, improve muscular elasticity, and increase circulation for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients.\n\nMost of these are best performed with a count of 10. #7 Grip Pull-Aparts do 2 times each way with a 2-4 count. #8 Cuban Press perform 3-5 times. #9 Russian Twist perform 10-20, if you only count the right side go 10. #10 Push-Up Plus perform 5-10. #11 Anchored Row perform 5-10.\n\nWarm-Up:\n1. Arm Rotations, Reverse Arm Rotations\n2. Single Arm Rotation, Reverse Single Arm Rotation\n3. Opposite Arm Rotations, Switch\n4. Forearm Rotation, Reverse Forearm Rotation\n5.

When Father Edward Sorin, C.S.C., envisioned the school that would be built next to two remote lakes in Indiana, he declared, \"This college will be one of the most powerful means of doing good in the country.\" Theology majors, having experienced the best of Notre Dame, are indeed powerful forces for good in this country, and in the world.\n\nhttp://theology.nd.edu\n\n---\n\nThe College of Arts and Letters is the University of Notre Dame's oldest and largest college.

M. luteus is found in soil, dust, water and air, and as part of the normal flora of the mammalian skin. The bacterium also colonizes the human mouth and upper respiratory tract. It was discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming before he discovered Penicillin in 1928.\n\nM. luteus is considered a contaminant in sick patients, is resistant to reduced water potential and can tolerate drying and high salt concentrations without forming spores, probably by slowing of major metabolic processes and induction of unique genes. \n\nM. luteus is coagulase negative, bacitracin susceptible, and forms bright yellow colonies on nutrient agar.", "title": "Culture a Bacteria on Agar \"Micrococcus luteus\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T10:59:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8c40L34pF5k", "description": "SolenoidI guess everybody has heard about solenoids. Solenoid is a coil of wire wound on a cylindrical surface. Well, if put simply then it is any inductance coil without a core. A solenoid's distinctive feature is its ability to draw ferromagnetic materials into the coil.Its power characteristic depends on the magnetic system structure (i.e. core and frame) and can be close to a linear characteristic.Let's try to make a solenoid and see how it works.We take a metal object and place it into the coil.DC solenoids are most often used as progressive power electrical drives. Unlike regular electromagnets they ensure substantial stroke of the mechanism. They drive the blades for cutting tickets and receipts in cash registers. They also drive lock catches, valves in engines, hydraulic systems, and other devices. The most popular and widely used solenoid is the so-called starting relay. It is a mechanism which connects a starter motor with the engine flywheel.", "title": "Solenoid", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T15:33:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8c4NbRzLjdo", "description": "A timelapse trip across Southeastern Wyoming.\n\nMusic:\nLuke Neumann - The Journey\n\nGear Used:\nCanon 5D3\n24-105 f/4\n16-35 f/2.8\nDynamic Perception Stage One\n\nMy Map: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=z132FxK4WBfw.kLTj-g48Ejl0\n\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/user13242032\n\nhttp://www.brianguicemedia.com\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/brianguicemedia", "title": "Summer In Southeastern Wyoming", "publishedDate": "2013-08-28T03:28:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8c4T3mYAOLU", "description": "Learn how to make corn husk flowers in only 30 seconds!

But not as you know them. 'Hands On Armada' is something different. Something refreshingly new and creative, as it points out the art of remixing. And not just that. It also points out the expertise of German mastermind Alex M.O.R.P.H.. \n\nNot only have the classics on this album moved millions of dance fans and created memories to be remembered for years, they've also got a special place in the hearts of the DJ's spinning them. One of them is Alex M.O.R.P.H., one of Germany's most prominent trance DJ's and producers. His productions, from 'Turn It On', ' Sunset Boulevard' and 'New Harvest' to Paul van Dyk collab 'In Between' and Rank 1 collab 'Life Less Ordinary', have given him a stellar reputation in quality trance. A reputation that also made his name rise as one of the most requested remixers. His remixes for the likes of Armin van Buuren, Faithless, Max Graham,  Filo & Peri and Josh Gabriel always stayed close to his very own sound. A sound, emotional but powerful, big room but sensitive. That same sound is heard on 'Hands On Armada', as Alex M.O.R.P.H. takes over 7 years of Armada classics and makes them completely 2010-fit. \n\nAlex:\"All of these tracks belong to my personal all time favorites in this music genre. They open up a lot of memories for me. They are fantastic and timeless compositions and sounds that marked a new era at that time\u2014but they don't sound up to date in 2010. The idea is not to make 'just another remix' of a classic, but to transform the original spirit of these productions and gain the quality to the highest level. And I'm sure many people will be infected now as we were a decade ago! I still love these classics today, that's why I wanted to put my hands on them.\"\nOn 'Hands On Armada', Alex M.O.R.P.H. touches classics likes 'Veracocha -  Carte Blanche', 'Binary Finary -- 1998', ' Pulser -- Point Of Impact', 'Insigma -- Open Our Eyes' and many more, to turn them into contagious, energetic and melodic infusions of the past and present. Old and new go hand in hand on 'Hands On Armada'.\n\nFor more info: http://www.armadamusic.com", "title": "CD2-05 The Thrillseekers - Synaesthesia (Alex M.O.R.P.H.`s Hands On Remix) [Hands On Armada Preview]", "publishedDate": "2010-12-08T09:54:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8cEBRVqs1IM", "description": "SVR 2 bedroom villa", "title": "Sheraton Vistana Resort 2 Bedroom Villa", "publishedDate": "2012-08-18T23:57:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8cEF8lG99LA", "description": "For classes/workshops CONTACT: booking.danieljerome@gmail.com\nSome raw footage of a class I taught recently in the hometown!

The Zahara series introduced in 2009 immediately became famous for its resistance to mildew and leaf spot, its nonstop blooms, and its larger flower size. Now we're delighted to announce a double-flowered cherry colored variety that will be the envy of the neighborhood. It has just won a 2010 AAS award, and it's waiting to transform your sunny garden into a sea of brightest red! These blooms are fully 2 \u00bd inches wide, and there's more of them -- they pop up all over super-compact plants, drawing bees and butterflies into the garden and absolutely wowing those hot, dry beds and water-starved containers. They're not really grown for cutflowers, but you'll find yourself picking plenty for bouquets . . . and why not? New flowers will open to replace them double-quick!\nRenowned for its ability to withstand heat, humidity, drought, and just about anything else, the Zahara series is the first bedding Zinnia that can truly claim to be disease-resistant. Mildew is a traditional enemy of the Zinnia, but Zahara's got it licked! (Or should we say \"dried\"?!) Luckily, it's also very long-blooming, prepared to continue well into autumn as long as the hot weather holds. What a joy!\n\nThis is the annual you'll want along that baking-hot driveway or cement path, crowding against the house (the walls reflect heat), and beautifying the patio (which never gets watered often enough). Just 8 to 12 inches high and wide, it can be planted a bit more closely than other bedding Zinnias, again thanks to the mildew resistance. No need to worry about the foliage \"touching\"!\n\nDirect-sow the seeds. When the soil has already warmed and spring is well underway, this plant will flower within 5 to 6 weeks of sowing. But if you want to get an earlier start, or if that hot April turns into a chilly May, no fear -- Zahara Double Cherry will grow vigorously all the same, and simply wait for the warm weather before blooming! Why can't all plants be this cooperative? No wonder it won an AAS award!

Handle the tasks of a classical farmer like cattle breeding and growing grain. Deal with the products of your farm and expand your machinery. \n\nThis game allows you to ride many tractors. Choose between many different models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm bigger areas. As a striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to maximize the crop. Don't kick over the traces or you won't be able to upgrade your farm and buy more land. Choose the right seed from different types of grains like barley, rye or wheat or decide to grow canola or corn. The harvest can be used as animal food or new seed as well as a product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices so you don't come out with losses after all the work.\n\nThe add-on \"Biogas\" expands the features of the original game \"Agricultural Simulator 2011\" by aspects of the green power generation. For that purpose, new expansions, crops and production cycles were added to the original gameplay. Harvest special crops for energy generation and transport those products to the biogas facility. In addition to the energy generation a complete new hay production cycle was added.\n\nSounds like a lot of work. Indeed, but you can invest your hardly earned money into helpers which can automatically seed and harvest your crops. Like that you can focus on the tasks you prefer and keep an eye on the expansion of your farm. If you do not want to leave the work of real men to these AI-Boys, simply enter the multiplayer mode and let your friends join you. Play with other farmers in the local network or via internet. \n\nThe Gold Edition delivers the full farming experience to the gamer.

Sensors in the eyes of the Face Bank detect your proximity and it begins eagerly chewing in anticipation of you shoving your hard earned cash in its gob-hole. Luckily, the coins can be easily removed again so you can use the Face Bank as a money box for your loose change.\n\nUsing sensors in its eyes, the Face Bank knows when youre about to feed it a delicious coin and starts to chew expectantly. Just wedge the coin in Face Banks mouth and it will chew and swallow it up. Dont try to feed it your finger or sweets though, its only interested in keeping your coins safe.\n\nFace Bank is hugely popular in Japan, where weird robots are highly sought after. The Face Bank uses a special PVC skin stretched over a number of electronic muscles to create a realistic chewing action. While at first the creepy monkey-like face may alarm you, once youve become accustomed to it it becomes irresistible and is a sure way of helping you save money.\n\nCheck out the video of the little critters in action.\n\nFace Bank will be your best friend. Just remember to feed it we cant be held responsible if you dont.

The suspects were managers of chemical companies, including the Jinchengjiang Hongquan Lithopne Material Company in Hechi City. Cadmium was first found in the Longjiang River, a tributary upstream of the Liujiang River, in mid-January. The concentration levels near the Lalang reservoir were 80 times above the official limit of 0.005 milligrams per liter. Cadmium is a cancer-causing chemical used for making batteries. It can damage the liver and kidneys, and reduces bone density. Environment protection staff poured aluminum chloride into the river to dissolve the contaminants. But the pollutants were still flowing downstream\u2014threatening water supplies for millions of residents living in Liujiang City.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Boston College vs. UMass | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T23:36:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8czOj2BT8uE", "description": "I don't own the melody or lyrics on this music video!\n\nDRUM N BASS GIGOLO GOREGRIND FROM CZECH REPUBLIC", "title": "Spasm - Miss Piss Junior", "publishedDate": "2011-09-14T23:18:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "8czUoFEz7lw", "description": "http://www.facts-about.org.uk/american-president-rutherford-hayes.htm Watch this video about President Rutherford Hayes providing interesting, fun facts and info about the life biography of Rutherford Hayes, President of the United States of America.

This starter course is very important, especially for wind resistance.\n\nGAF offers Pro-Start and WeatherBlocker starter strips that are manufactured with a perforated line.    This feature is a real time saver by eliminating the need to manually cut and cleanup shingles tabs.\n\nAlong with convenience and savings; the Pro-Start and WeatherBlocker products utilizing advanced Dura Grip adhesive to achieve maximum protection against wind blow-offs.  Now that we have covered the importance and benefits of  GAF precut starter strips lets take a look at they install. \n\n\nFor shingles exposure less than six inches, the use of either Pro-start or Weatherblocker starter strips can be used. For such applications; begin by separating the strip at the perforated line.\n\nWhen applying shingles with exposures greater than 6 inches, such as the Camelot collection, only full un-split WeatherBlocker starter strip can be used. \n\nPlace the appropriate sized starter strip with the sealant facing up at the eave edge. \nFor proper water drainage, Both Pro-Start and Weatherblocker starter strip require a one quarter to three quarter inches overhang at all eave and rake edges.\n\nEvery Starter strip requires a minimum of four nails driven in a linear fashion one and a half to three inches above the shingle's bottom edge.  Begin with the first nail at a distance of one and a half to three inches from the beginning side edge. Space the remaining three nails ten to twelve inches from the previous nail, and the fourth nail one to two inches from the ending edge.\n\n\nWhen installing Metric dimensioned shingles, you must trim five inches off the first WeatherBlocker starter strip or three inches off the first ProStart starter strip.  This critical step ensures that the starter strip butt joints and overlapping shingles butt joints are off-set a minimum of four inches. Depending on the length of the shingle being installed, A 10 to12 inch section of starter strip may periodically need to be cut and installed to meet the required 4 inch offset. Fasten the adjustment starter strip with two nails one to two inches from each side end.\n\n\nFor maximum wind resistance, starter strips should be installed along all rake edges. Begin by laying the strip with the sealant side up, closest to the rake edge.  Position the starter strip so that it overlaps the eave starter strip by at least three inches.

The most frustrating part is when it doesn't stick-- but after you learn the \"science\" of knife throwing (in that the knife completes a half spin that is about 3 - 4 times the length of the knife)  it becomes much easier.  This tutorial should also help you gauge your full spin distance ranging from small knives (6 inches) to large knives (14 inches).  Good luck!\n\nBy the way, I have modified my \"pinch grip\" into what I think of now is a \"pencil grip\"-- I started doing this naturally because of how heavy long knives can be.  You can pinch the knives at a different angle (in which the knife is perpendicular to the ground rather than parallel), but I believe If I pinch it so the knife rests in the web of skin between my thumb and index finger, it'll keep me more consistent with my throws (which I need to work on).  Notably, most knife throwers, as far as I know, don't throw using my \"pencil grip\" but usually so that the knife is perpendicular to the ground before their release.  \n\nThere are other grips to try. For example, you can throw using the \"hammer grip\" which I know John Bailey uses (that's holding the knife like a hammer), or holding your thumb along the spine, which was recommended to me by Joe Darrah (maker of the knives I throw in this video).\n\nFor a GREAT instructional DVD on knife throwing, check out Jack Dagger's website.

We address this limitation by proposing an approximation framework for streaming hierarchical video segmentation motivated by data stream algorithms: each video frame is processed only once and does not change the segmentation of previous frames. We implement the graph-based hierarchical segmentation method within our streaming\nframework; our method is the first streaming hierarchical video segmentation method proposed. We perform thorough experimental analysis on a benchmark video data set and longer videos.

The only variable is WHO they saw first!\n\n\nWhy We're Different\nWe know you have many options to choose from in Austin for chiropractic care, but Active Life Healing Center is a bit different from your run-of-the-mill clinic because:\n\n1. We're the only clinic that now has 3 doctors on their staff to consult about every patient. We use a variety of adjusting techniques to fit every patient, regardless if they like manual adjusting or gentle non-force, so we definitely have you covered. We have great manual adjusting, activator technique, light non-force, BEST, and even Thompson Drop Table. Postural distortion patterns are evaluated and treated with specialized exercises and adjusting techniques.\n\n2. We're the only clinic where ALL three doctors are graston-certified with continuing education in fascial distortion patterns.\n\n3. We're one of the few clinics who focuses on helping shape and change your posture and body structure so problems do not reoccur.\n\n4. Our clinic offers a Food sensitivity test as well as helping you design a nutrition program to help you detoxify, as well as helping you with adrenal fatigue, hormones, etc. This can be extremely helpful if you suffer from migraines, digestive problems or fatigue, or that overall blah feeling.\n\n5. We're one of the few clinics that has 5 highly trained Licensed Massage Therapists that are skilled in myofascial release, pre-natal massage, lymphatic drainage sports massage etc. You can request the therapist you want, based on your needs, and our massage hours are 6 days a week.\n\n6. We're the only clinic with our very own Therapeutic Yoga and Movement Studio conveniently located right next door! We offer discounts on classes for our Active Life patients as well as the option of having your Active Life doctor speak to the class instructor about the issues you are dealing with so you can get maximum benefit and joy from your class. \n\n7.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "7/13/14: Giants hit two grand slams en route to win", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T02:42:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dQo3ukccnQ", "description": "http://www.realrawresults.com/got-weeds\n\nYes, plural, with an S on the end. Come on, get a job you hippy bum! ;) \n\nHere's my garden, South Dakota 2013 edition. My mother told me to go out back and do some weedin' in my garden the other night, so I happily went out to take a look. Much to my satisfaction I wasn't going to be needing to do any weed pulling, just eating! Edible, nutritious, and tasty Purslane and Lambsquarters are popping up all over my garden, and I plan on eating them at bay. :) \n\n\"Purslane:\n\nIf you've ever lived in the city, you have seen good ol' Portulaca olearacea, or common purslane. The stuff grows in cracks in the sidewalk. Aside from being surprisingly tasty for a crack dweller, purslane tops the list of plants with omega-3 fatty acids, the type of healthy fat found in salmon.\n\nIf you dislike the bitter taste of dandelion greens, you still might like the lemony taste of purslane. The stems, leaves and flowers are all edible; and they can be eaten raw on salads \u2014 as they are prepared worldwide \u2014 or lightly saut\u00e9ed.\n\nYou should keep a few things in mind, though, before your harvest. Watch out for spurge, a similar-looking sidewalk-crack dweller. Spurge is much thinner than purslane, and it contains a milky sap, so you can easily differentiate it. Also, your mother might have warned you about eating things off the sidewalk; so instead, look for purslane growing in your garden, or consider transplanting it to your garden from a sidewalk.\n\nAlso, note the some folks incorrectly call purslane \"pigweed,\" but that's a different weed \u2014 edible but not as tasty.\n\nLamb's-quarters:\n\nLamb's-quarters are like spinach, except they are healthier, tastier and easier to grow. Lamb's-quarters, also called goosefoot, usually need more than a sidewalk crack to grow in, unlike dandelion or purslane. Nevertheless, they can be found throughout the urban landscape, wherever there is a little dirt.\n\nThe best part of the lamb's-quarters are the leaves, which are slightly velvety with a fine white powder on their undersides. Discard any dead or diseased leaves, which are usually the older ones on the bottom of the plant. The leaves and younger stems can be quickly boiled or saut\u00e9ed, and they taste like a cross between spinach and Swiss chard with a slight nutty after-taste.\n\nMaybe that taste combination doesn't appeal to you, but lamb's-quarters are ridiculously healthy. A one-cup serving will give you 10 times the daily-recommended dose of vitamin K; three times the vitamin A; more than enough vitamin C; and half your daily dose of calcium and magnesium.\"\n\nSOURCE: http://www.livescience.com/15322-healthiest-backyard-weeds.html#sthash.rS684X8t.dpuf\n\n\nCheck out my website and sign up for my newsletter to get more nutrition and weight loss information and to receive my FREE special report \"The Top 10 Biggest, Fattest Lies You've Been Told About Weight-Loss\": http://www.realrawresults.com\n\n\n\"Like\" Chris Randall of Real Raw Results on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/RealRawResults\n\n\nSend Chris a donation and buy him a bunch of bananas to see more great videos: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=XMBMXSEN677QC\n\nweeds, edible plants, purslane, wild edibles, edible weeds, lambsquarters, lambsquarter, edible plants in the wild, weeds you can eat,", "title": "GOT WEEDS?!?!", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T23:25:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dQvUMVQA1Y", "description": "NASA Confirms A 2,500-Square-Mile Cloud Of Methane Floating Over US Southwest\n\nWhen NASA researchers first saw data indicating a massive cloud of methane floating over the American Southwest, they found it so incredible that they dismissed it as an instrument error.\n\nBut as they continued analyzing data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography instrument from 2002 to 2012, the \u201catmospheric hot spot\u201d kept appearing.", "title": "NASA:2,500-Square-Mile Cloud Of Methane Floating Over US", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T04:46:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dRXsTbdN-o", "description": "Il mio allevamento di questi simpatici ed utilissimi animaletti che uso per sfamare i miei Guppy", "title": "Allevamento Artemia salina in casa", "publishedDate": "2009-01-17T19:47:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dRZPvwSyRs", "description": "Boss Music for SoulKnights!

It's almost always going to involve some sort of a traumatic event. The ligaments in your knee are fairly strong by nature. They're thick. There are two ligaments that run on the outside of your knee called your medial collateral ligament and your lateral collateral ligament. Then you have two ligaments on the inside of your knee called your ACL and PCL, or anterior cruciate ligament and your posterior cruciate ligament. So you have four ligaments that are there to support you knee.\n\nThe medial and lateral collateral ligaments, they're going to require you to either experience what's called a varus or a valgus force to the knee. That's basically a blow to the side of your knee, the inner side or the outer side, and like a rubber band, if you take a blow to the inside of your knee, it's going to create what's called a varus force, and then the outer ligament is susceptible to a tear. A blow to the outside of the knee is going to create a valgus force, and that's going to create a problem with the medial collateral on the inside of your knee. Based on that, the medial collateral ligament is much more susceptible to injury as we typically take our blows from the outside and creating a tear to the medial ligament. \n\nThe LCL is often spared from trauma and often stays intact. On the inside of your knee, you have your PCL and your ACL. The posterior or PCL is in a nicer place inside your knee. So it's going to require more of a blunt force to the front, like in a football game or something, to create that tear.\n\nAnd lastly is the ACL. I saved the ACL for last because that is the most susceptible ligament that gets injured. You may know one or two people that have had ACL injuries and ACL tears before. The reason why it's such a common one is its location inside the knee, and therefore it's so susceptible to both blows to the outer and inner, blows to the front, but it's also very susceptible to other traumatic events like landing long on your feet or simply twisting your knee when you're playing sports, or if you're running really fast and you have to decelerate on a dime, that might actually literally tear the ACL. So it's in a weird place. It's in a tricky spot inside your knee. It's much more susceptible to tears, and we deal with that the most in the clinic. LCLs being the least common and ACLs being the most common.", "title": "Causes of Ligament Tears | Knee Exercises", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T05:42:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dg2MYRudc4", "description": "T7 RNA polymerase elongation with ATP in PyMOL using 'pretty' preset representation, ray-traced, and performing a full rotation about the Y-axis", "title": "T7 RNA polymerase elongation with ATP - Y-Roll", "publishedDate": "2010-10-26T14:35:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dgI6CvLPu0", "description": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. \nPeople who have ocd, continually have unwanted over powering thoughts obsessions, they drive them to compulsive actions in a afford to make those thoughts go away.\nHere i show one of several obsessions of this disorder, symmetry.\nExcessive preoccupation with exactness, or perfect symmetry with items or\neven with himself.\n\nSchool project developed in ASP, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland.\n\nCatarina Coutinho", "title": "OCD, Symmetry", "publishedDate": "2012-03-03T05:29:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dgZbYRuMyc", "description": "A park in the city is a good place to be in almost anytime of the year, but of course, there are more things to do and see in the spring time especially when you have a good weather with it.", "title": "Sights and sounds of spring in Hohhot Inner Mongolia", "publishedDate": "2014-04-12T08:49:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dgdYMFEwJk", "description": "Unboxing of my newly received Oakley custom flak jacket sun glasses.", "title": "Oakley Custom Flak Jacket unboxing", "publishedDate": "2010-07-06T02:30:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dgeqZTZwHk", "description": "Earth is an electrical planet, charged with a subtle surface energy commonly known in the electrical world as \"ground.\" When in contact with the Earth, this tranquil energy naturally transfers to any conductive object\u2014whether it is a metal rod, a wire, a tree or plant, an animal, or a barefoot human\u2014and they become \"grounded.\"\n\nThe known effect of grounding is that it discharges and prevents the buildup of electrical stress.

These videos were made using Paint.NET and FL Studio 10. All songs and photos belong to their original creators.

At first, the portal was harmless, but then, creatures and malevolent forces emerged from the portal. Enter the main trainer, along with the trainer's opposite-gender childhood friend. They have recently cleared through the Elite Four, and were called in as Champions to assist in defending Unova. Unfortunately, they were detained for some time while trying to arrive, so when they finally got there, the forces of defense were already weakened. The scientists called to the feild were able to find a few things: This portal was actually a complex of 13 different portals (minimum), and it works as a two-way road, but unfortunetely, the scouts sent into the portal were lost within 1 hour every time. The two champions agree to assist in whatever way they can, but just when they were about to enter the portal themselves, it began to fluctuate, and a multitude of creatures unseen to the Pokemon world, rushed outward all at once. The two trainers were knocked uncincious. When they awoke, the scientists determined that each of the 13 worlds sent at least one enemy into their world. These enemies were known to have no sense of reason, no understanding of using Pokemon to battle (in fact, they all seemed to prefer to fight on their own), and no mercy. The two champions are now tasked with traveling together to face each of these enemies and send them back to wherever they came from. Once this is accomplished, they must travel into the portal, and try to make peace with all 13 worlds to protect the future of Unova.\n ~This is a fanmade scenario, and is in no way a legitimate crossover DLC for Pokemon Black and White.

Then in a dazzling display of choreography, all the components of a molecular machine lock together around the RNA to form a miniature factory called a ribosome. It translates the genetic information in the RNA into a string of amino acids that will become a protein. Special transfer molecules, the green triangles, bring each amino acid to the ribosome. The amino acids are the small red tips attached to the transfer molecules. There are different transfer molecules for each of the twenty amino acids. Each transfer molecule carries a three letter code that is matched with the RNA in the machine. Now we come to the heart of the process. Inside the ribosome, the RNA is pulled through like a tape. The code for each amino acid is read off, three letters at a time, and matched to three corresponding letters on the transfer molecules. When the right transfer molecule plugs in, the amino acid it carries is added to the growing protein chain. Again, you are watching this in real time. And after a few seconds the assembled protein starts to emerge from the ribosome. Ribosomes can make any kind of protein. It just depends what genetic message you feed in on the RNA. In this case, the end product is hemoglobin. The cells in our bone marrow churn out a hundred trillion molecules of it per second! And as a result, our muscles, brain and all the vital organs in our body receive the oxygen they need.", "title": "mRNA Translation (Basic)", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T18:42:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dt15VbKx9w", "description": "www.asc365.com\n\nhttp://stores.ebay.ca/asc365-store-art/Cutter-Plotter-/_i.html?_fsub=2445656014&_sid=159236914&_trksid=p4634.c0.m322\n\nASC365 Mini Flatbed Cutting Plotter is a 13\" mini desktop cutting and drawing plotter, it fulfills a wide variety of cutting applications where roll-feed cutting plotters are not suitable because of thicker rigid substrates such as chip boards and paperboards.

Related species in the genus Myrciaria, often referred to by the same common name, are native to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. The tree is grown for its purplish-black, white-pulped fruits; they can be eaten raw or be used to make jellies and drinks (plain juice or wine). Other common names include Brazilian Grape Tree, Jaboticaba, Jabotica, Jabuticabeira, Guaperu, Guapuru, Hivapuru, Sabar\u00e1 and Ybapuru (Guarani).\n\nJabuticaba tree\nThe tree has salmon-colored leaves when they are young, turning green as they mature. It is a very slow growing tree which prefers moist, lightly acidic soils for best growth. It is widely adaptable, however, and grows satisfactorily even on alkaline beach-sand type soils, so long as they are tended and irrigated. Its flowers are white and grow directly from its trunk in a cauliflorous habit. Naturally the tree may flower and fruit only once or twice a year, but when continuously irrigated it flowers frequently, and fresh fruit can be available year round in tropical regions.\nThe fruit is 3--4 cm in diameter with one to four large seeds, borne directly on the main trunks and branches of the plant, lending a distinctive appearance to the fruiting tree. It has a thick, purple, astringent skin that covers a sweet, white or rosy pink gelatinous flesh. Common in Brazilian markets, jabuticabas are largely eaten fresh; their popularity has been likened to that of grapes in the US. Fresh fruit may begin to ferment 3 to 4 days after harvest, so they are often used to make jams, tarts, strong wines, and liqueurs. Due to the extremely short shelf-life, fresh jabuticaba fruit is very rare in markets outside of areas of cultivation. Traditionally, an astringent decoction of the sun-dried skins has been used as a treatment for hemoptysis, asthma, diarrhoea, and gargled for chronic inflammation of the tonsils.\n\n\nLeaves of Plinia cauliflora\nSeveral potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory anti-cancer compounds have been isolated from the fruit. One that is unique to the fruit is jaboticabin.\nIn Brazil the fruit of several related species, namely Myrciaria tenella and M. trunciflora, share the same common name. While all jabuticaba species are subtropical and can tolerate mild, brief frosts, some species may be marginally more cold-tolerant. Commercial cultivation of the fruit in the Northern Hemisphere is more restricted by extremely slow growth and the short shelf-life of fruit than by temperature requirements. Grafted plants may bear fruit in 5 years; seed grown trees may take 10 to 20 years to bear fruit, though their slow growth and small size when immature make them popular as bonsai or container ornamental plants in temperate regions. Jabuticabas are fairly adaptable to various kinds of growing conditions, tolerating sand or rich topsoil. They are intolerant of salty soils or salt spray. They are tolerant of mild drought, though fruit production may be reduced, and irrigation will be required in extended or severe droughts.", "title": "Jabuticaba - The Brazilian Grape Tree(It Grows Fruits & Flowers Directly on The Trunk)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T11:41:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dtyFOvXlY0", "description": "Haliaeetus pelagicus pelagicus\navifauna alphen aan de rijn holland", "title": "steller's sea eagle", "publishedDate": "2011-01-05T12:02:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8duOwtZaxyA", "description": "", "title": "Iontophoresis - special guest star Dr. Mercer!!!", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T17:43:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8dvJCsBwowg", "description": "FRANCISCO GOMEZ EL NUEVO REY DE LA MUSICA POPULAR  Y SU AGRUPACION LOS MAJESTADES DEL DESPECHO\nCONTACTOS .COMERCIALES :3105517243 .3124523090 .\n3122753710 . .
