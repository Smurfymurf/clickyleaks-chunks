If men want to try something new, this supplement might be their answer because it uses ancient Oriental formulas to help really increase the sex drive and overall sex health of men.\n\nThe main active ingredient in this product is Deer Antler. That does not mean they cut the antlers off of deer and grind it into a supplement you take in the form of a capsule. This company takes the antler is a premature form and uses it as a potent aphrodisiac. This is a very humane method, and is natural at its best. No side effects are caused by Deer Antler Plus, and every ingredient used in this supplement work in different ways to make this product potent.\n\nOne huge benefit for men to take into consideration is that these pills can help to boost sperm count.

Immunoglobulins are \"Y\" shaped molecules that connect on one end to invading microbes (antigens) and on the other end they bind with various white cells that effectivley block and destroy the antigen. These specialized antibody molecules come in different shapes and sizes in order to provide flexibility in matching and destroying targeted antigens. Antibody molecules are found floating in the plasma as well as on the surface of specialized B-cells. \n\nImmunoglobulins are constructed from two types of amino acid chains, heavy chains and light chains. Ig molecules contain two identical strands of heavy chains and two identical strands of light chains. The end with the two heavy chains forms a stable non-variable receptor point called an effector, which is the part of the Ig molecule that binds with our own immune system cells. \n\nOn the opposite end of the antibody are two antigen binding sites, each with a light chain and heavy chain combination. This combination of light and heavy chains forms highly variable tips that can adapt to match a specific antigen. \n\nImmunoglobulins come in five basic types: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. Each type targets a specific type of antigen, which determines the make-up of the Y chain structure of each. \n\nIgD, IgE and IgGs all use a single Y chain whether as stand alone antibodies or as receptors connected to white cells. \n\nIgAs use a double Y chain, called a Dimer. \n\nIgMs are unique in that they form a single Y chain when expressed on the surface of a B-cell, but the stand alone version of the IgM molecule forms a combination of five Y chains, known as a pentamer. Consequently, stand alone IgMs form a very large antibody molecule.", "title": "Video 15 Ig Antibodies and Immunoglobulin Function", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T14:30:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6AABKtuVcC0", "description": "~~CZYTAJ OPIS~~~~\nUrsus 1224 z gruberem.

I am a young composer. I like to compose piano suites, string quartet and quintet, epic orchestral suite, creepy orchestral suite and some lullabies (not to mention about the scores I've made for my books). I like classical and mellow genre. Some of my videos are my arrangements I mean I arranged it with the orchestra or a piano solo a quite different from the original. I live a simple life when the music interrupts my life. Now I sit on the piano and play or compose much music I can. Beethoven, Bach, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Vivaldi, Pachelbel and Mozart are the persons who inspire me a lot about music. They are the best composers I know. Because even though they are successful the melody behind each composition are their own emotions. I mean the emotion of the music is there. That's why I like them all. I know that they are dead but I want to meet them all someday. Some of my videos or music was originally made by me. I actually do a lot of hobby. I don't were to start. But anyways hope you like my videos.\n\nAny Questions?

But what does that actually mean?\n\nThe human eye is constructed like a camera - with a clear lens in the front. The lens is located just behind the iris. It is contained in an elastic capsule. This capsule will serve as the housing for the new lens. All light that enters the eye has to pass through this lens.\n\nAs we age, this lens can become cloudy and gradually lose its ability to focus properly. This is called a cataract.If left untreated, a cataract can grow steadily worse - interfering more and more with your vision.\nGenerally, replacing a cataract with an artificial lens is a simple procedure.\n\nIt usually involves a single incision in the white of the eye. Through this single opening the cataract is removed and the artificial lens is inserted.\n\nYour Procedure:\n\nOn the day of your operation, you will be asked to put on a surgical gown.\n\nYou may receive a sedative by mouth and an intravenous line may be put in.\n\nAnd you'll given eye drops to dilate, or open, the pupil.\n\nYou will then be transferred to the operating table.\n\nTo begin, the surgeon will use a special instrument to gently hold the eyelids apart.\n\nThen the surgeon will apply an antiseptic solution to the skin around the eye before injecting a local anesthetic.\n\n\nWhile the anesthetic is taking effect, the surgeon will position a microscope in front of the eye.\n\nBy now, the pupil will be fully open, or dilated.\n\nWhen the operative field is numb, the surgeon will use the microscope to help make an incision just above the iris. \n\nNext the surgeon will open the top of the capsule and remove the lens.\n\nThrough the same incision the surgeon will insert the new lens.\n\nTemporary sutures are used to close the incision.\n\nPatient Engagement and Education Company", "title": "Cataract - Large Incision PreOp\u00ae Patient Engagement and Education", "publishedDate": "2014-06-08T20:28:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6AXtOnR5dnE", "description": "Chris and Rebecca update the HST mailing list. \nAre you on it yet?

He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing. In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his singing career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who noticed him at a talent show.\n\nEccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially-oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\n\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organized concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and \"Reggae Soul Revue; from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\n\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonnaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blue Busters.\n\nHe went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\". Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" was released by the recently-created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's Crystalites), featuring Winston Wright. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\n\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (a UK subsidiary of Trojan Records). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").\n\nA socialist militant, Eccles took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organizing a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle. They went around the island to support the campaign of People's National Party (PNP) leader Michael Manley. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power For The People\", \"Rod Of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\n\nBy the mid 1970s, his popularity declined and he had to live off the money from his concerts. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on June 30, 2005 in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.", "title": "The Dynamites - (Clancy Eccles) - Eternally", "publishedDate": "2009-02-15T13:28:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6AaiGMVdxkQ", "description": "http://www.mspaintadventures.com/\nhttp://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=002657", "title": "Homestuck - WV: Ascend", "publishedDate": "2009-10-12T17:23:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6AbPXMPNuAo", "description": "Authorities of the University of Abuja have agreed to transfer its protesting medical students to other institutions as demanded by them.\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Prof. James Adelabu, who made this known after the school's Senate meeting, however, said the final approval was with the National Universities Commission.\n- See more at: http://www.ngstudentsresource.com/uniabuja-transfer-protesting-medical-students-to-other-institution/#sthash.Dtm9Hv88.dpuf\n\nMedical students of the University of Abuja blocked entrance to the school Monday morning to protest stalled medical programmes at Uniabuja without accreditation.\nThe medical students demanded to be transferred to other universities, complaining they were tired of the school authorities \"lying to us, deceiving us, wasting our productive years.\"\nThey have also demanded that the university pay each medical student N10 million each in compensation for the \"torture\" of attending school for nearly a decade without accreditation.\nThe protest, which was largely peaceful, prompted the cancellation of examinations set for thousands of distance-learning students.\nEarly on, the students were met with heavy campus security intent on forcing open the school gates, which the protesters had sealed.\nStudents claim security on orders forced the gates open and threw stones at them, with one insisting a security used a \"knife\" on him.\nSecurity \"broke down the lock we kept on the gate, they started stoning,\" he said. \"We were on our own.

In this timeline, Vladimir Lenin was assassinated in 1916 and the Russian Revolution was prevented. With Russia in disarray, this timeline's Hitler was able to concentrate on the Western front, and conquered Belgium, France and Britain in quick succession. He followed his victories in Europe by invading the United States of America, conquering New York City, Washington, DC and much of the Eastern seaboard. In 1944, this Hitler made a state visit to New York and pledged to eradicate \"financial privateers\" (euphemism for Jewish interests).

William Hogarth (1697-1764) is one of the few artists whose works define a period of history. His paintings, drawings, engravings and portraits have become the accepted representation of 18th century London, chronicling the seething, impossible London of Gin Lane and Beer Street, with a piercing almost narrative moral sense, shown in such prints as A Harlot's Progress, the pictorial tale of a country girl gone to ruin. A complex, profoundly curious artist, Hogarth left a rich legacy and here his entire corpus is studied together with reproductions of much of his celebrated series The Rake's Progress and Marriage a la Mode. From the 1730s, Hogarth knew the power of novelty to sell and was determined upon reaching, through engravings, as large an audience as possible and Samuel Johnson unashamedly admired 'the pencil of a Hogarth'. 'Be vice and Dulness far away, Great Hogarth's honour'd dust is here.'

Whole life insurance is permanent life insurance coverage that lasts as long as you live and continue to make on time premium payments. The reason that whole life insurance quotes are so much more expensive is due to the fact that the policy will have to pay out a death benefit when you die.\n\nWhole life insurance quotes are available online from many insurance companies that have an online presence. Online life insurance quotes let you search for the policy that best suits your needs. When you log onto each site, you can read the information regarding the whole life insurance policies available and request free quotes. You should request at least three or more quotes so you can compare the different rates.\n\nWhen you compare the whole life insurance quotes you have got, the cheapest is not always the best one to choose. They can be quite affordable because the payment of premiums stretches out over a longer period of time. When you are comparing the online life insurance quotes you receive, you shouldn't just think about the amount of the monthly premium but the length of time that you have to pay the premiums.\n\nWhen comparing whole life insurance quotes there are quite a few things to think about.\n\nFor a website totally devoted to Life Insurance visit Peter's Website Life Insurance Answers and find out about Life Insurance Answers as well as Term Life Insurance and more, including Online Life Insurance and Life Insurance Agents.\n\nhttp://tiny.cc/LifeInsuranceQuotes\n\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Peter_Crump\n\n\nHelpful Tags:\n\n----------------------------------------------\nSearches related to life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance calculator\n\nmanulife life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance quotes\n\nlife insurance companies\n\nterm life insurance rates\n\nterm life insurance\n\nlife insurance rates by age\n\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates\nterm life insurance rates\nwhole life insurance rates\nbest life insurance rates\ncompare life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates by age\nlife insurance rate\naverage life insurance rates\nbest term life insurance rates\ncheap life insurance rates\npermanent life insurance rates\nlife insurance ratings\nlife insurance rate quote\nlife insurance rate chart\nterm life insurance rate\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rate quotes\nlife insurance company ratings\nbanner life insurance rating\nterm life insurance rates chart\nterm life insurance rates by age\nterm life insurance quotes\nlife insurance rate calculator\nlife insurance quotes\nlife insurance quote\nonline term life insurance rates\nterm life insurance\nlife insurance companies\nwhole life insurance quotes\nbest life insurance companies\nwhole life insurance\nbest life insurance\nbest term life insurance rate\ncheap life insurance\nuniversal life insurance\nlife insurance types\nlife insurance quotes online\nsenior life insurance\nlife insurance\nbest term life insurance\nterm life insurance quote\nlife insurance policies\naverage term life insurance rates\nlife insurance cost\naffordable life insurance\n20 year term life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates term\ninstant life insurance quotes\nonline life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates comparison\ntop rated life insurance companies\n--------------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/lifeinsuranceratable\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TermLifeInsuranceify\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLifeinsurancequot\n\nlife insurance rates,life insurance calculator,manulife life insurance rates,life insurance quotes,life insurance companies,term life insurance rates,term life insurance,life insurance rates by age,mortgage life insurance rates", "title": "Life Insurance Rates!

What junk scientists are saying about a plant growing in the lung is absolutely bogus!!  Ron Svenden's story about a pea growing in his lungs is false!!\n \nA pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the legume Pisum sativum. Each pod contains several peas. Peapods are botanically a fruit since they contain seeds developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower, however a peas are considered to be a vegetable in cooking. \n\nThe name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus.\n\n BOGUS STORY from the Media:\n\nRon Svenden became severely ill when he checked into a hospital this past Memorial Day. He was finding it hard to breathe. The 75-year-old from Cape Cod on Massachusetts thought he was going to find out he had developed lung cancer. However, something quite different occurred. Svenden told a television station in Boston, Massachusetts that he had a pea seed growing in his lung. \n\nApparently a pea that he had eaten somehow found its way to his lung and split then ultimately sprouted. His doctor, Jeff Spillane, a thoracic surgeon in Hyannis, MA, took the wayward pea out.\n\nIt's unknown how long the seed was present in his patient's lung. \n\nIt is his belief that it couldn't make it out of Svenden's airway because he's got emphysema and was unable to cough it up.\n\nExperts say that sprouting something within the body is not out of the question. \n\nA horticulturist from Atlanta, Walter Reeves, says that seeds don't have to have light to grow. \n\nThey need only moisture and warmth for the first few days.", "title": "About peas Mr Junk Scientist", "publishedDate": "2010-08-14T21:16:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6BMjZ9Ky6jw", "description": "Hi beautiful people!!!

The Aranyaprathet-Poipet border is notorious for the visa hustle, well-dressed official looking people trying to guide you into their official looking offices... only to overcharge you for a Cambodian visa.\n\nMy best advice is... Know before you go. I've filmed our border crossing to help prepare others planning this adventure. \n\nWhat You Need To Know\nThe visa hustle begins BEFORE you get to Thai Immigration departures. If you're taking a tuk tuk to the border, they will try to drop you off at one of the many official looking offices near the border. If you find yourself in this situation, ask your driver to take you directly to departures at Thai Immigration. Do not pay them until they do so. \n\nOnce inside the Thai Immigration building, wait in line and have your departure form filled out and ready to go. When it's your turn, the officers will check your departure info, collect the form, stamp your visa and send you on your way.\n\nAfter departing the Thai Immigration building, get ready for more hustle and touts on the street. There are a few tourist guides that actually try to help get you to the correct buildings. Unfortunately there's no way to tell the real guides apart from the hustlers... So it's best to know exactly where you're going.\n\nWalk across the bridge until you get to the Kingdom Of Cambodia archway, directly to your right is the International Border Control Of Poipet. This is the official building where you can obtain a visa on arrival, make sure to have 2 passport sized photos ready for them as well. *If you have an e-visa, you can skip stopping here and go straight to Arrivals at the Cambodian border.\n\nAfter receiving your visa, pass through the Kingdom Of Cambodia archway, walk a few minutes to the Arrivals building, where you'll be greeted by a border control officer and receive an arrival/departure form at the entrance. Fill out your form and wait in line (lines are long here). When it's your turn, an officer will check your passport, stamp your visa, collect your arrival form, fingerprint you and send you out the door. \n\nCongratulations you have successfully crossed the Thai/Poipet border! \n\nAt the roundabout you'll find free shuttles to the bus station. These are legitimate, but before getting on, confirm that shuttle is going to the bus station (International Tourist Terminal).\n\nAt the bus station you can purchase tickets for your Cambodian destination. Options are bus, minivan, shared taxi, taxi. Prices are between $9-12. Unless you're taking a private taxi, expect to pay $48.\n\nGood luck on your journey! \nxoxo,\nChristine\n\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod", "title": "Cambodia Border Crossing", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T01:40:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6BcTGQenVNs", "description": "Bei uns dahoam", "title": "SAM 1112", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T16:48:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6BdBc3eaC5Y", "description": "Madison Bumgarner pitches a shutout as the San Francisco Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 5-0 in game five of the 2014 World Series.", "title": "Giants Beat Royals 5-0 in Game 5 World Series Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T06:08:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6BdNTV8BoeI", "description": "**xXx** In ca. 1 - 2 Wochen, werde ich die deutschen Anleitungen zum Rentier- und Elefanten Hugger ver\u00f6ffentlichen!!! **xXx**\n\nDanke f\u00fcr's Anschauen.

The tubes are produced with electrostatic and electromagnetic control, where electrostatic or magnetic fields deviate the electron beam respectively. Animation shows the principle scheme of CRT with electrostatic control as well as the motion of the electrons in the beam drawing a sinusoid on the screen of oscilloscope. CRT consists of the glass bulb evacuated to a high vacuum, the cathode (a source of electrons), cathode heater, electrodes for brightness and focus control, several accelerating anodes, the pairs of horizontal and vertical capacitor plates deviating the electron beam, and fluorescing screen. One of anodes, which accelerate the electrons, is placed close to the screen. The high positive voltage is applied to this electrode. Under the action of the applied voltage the electrons are moved  with acceleration from cathode to anode. In the absence of the voltage applied to deviating plates of the capacitor the electron beam will be incident on the screen in the center brightening a point in the fluorescing layer. In oscilloscope the analyzed signal after amplification is applied to vertical deviating plates, while the periodic sawtooth signal is applied to horizontal plates. As a result the electron beam \"draws\"  the dependence of the investigated signal on time on the screen of the tube. Reaching the right side of the screen the beam has to be returned to an initial point at the left side. Thus, if CRT is not blanked during this retrace, then the beam will leave a track crossing the image of investigated signal.

The seeds are poisonous to people, animals and insects. All plant parts are poisonous if ingested.\n\nThe castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It belongs to a monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools. The toxicity of raw castor beans is due to the presence of ricin. Although the lethal dose in adults is considered to be four to eight seeds, reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare.  According to the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records, this plant is the most poisonous in the world. Despite this, suicides involving ingestion of castor beans are unheard of in countries like India where castor grows abundantly on the roadsides. The aversion to the use of the beans in suicide could be due to the painful and unpleasant symptoms of overdosing on ricin, which can include nausea, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and seizures persisting for up to a week. However, the poison can be extracted from castor by concentrating it with a fairly complicated process similar to that used for extracting cyanide from almonds. If ricin is ingested, symptoms may be delayed by up to 36 hours but commonly begin within 2\u20134 hours. These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3\u20135 days, however in most cases a full recovery can be made. Poisoning occurs when animals, including humans, ingest broken seeds or break the seed by chewing: intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin.Toxicity varies among animal species: four seeds will kill a rabbit, five a sheep, six an ox or horse, seven a pig, and eleven a dog. Ducks have shown far more resistance to the seeds: it takes an average of 80 to kill them.

The creamy-yellow flower spikes, whilst attractive, are not as interesting as the spiky maroon-red seed pods. In warmer climates ricinus can grow to the size of a small tree up to 15ft high, but it is usually grown as an annual in the UK and is unlikely to reach a height of much more thn 4ft/1.3m. However, it may be possible to over-winter container plants in a warm conservatory.  Note: All parts of the plant are poisonous, particularly the seeds. Handle the plant with care, as the sap may cause rritation to some individuals. See more: \nhttp://www.norfolkcottagegarden.co.uk/shop/item/Ricinus-communis-Impala\n\nThis plant is very poisonous to animals like horses,cows,dogs,cats etc  It can make honey toxic aswell.\n\nRicinus communis 'Impala' is a compact variety and grows to a reasonable garden height of around 120cm  with gorgeous copper-red palmate leaves with vibrant red veins. The leaves have deeply incised lobes and grow 30 to 75cm  across. The plants have red stems and in late summer clusters of creamy yellow blooms are followed by stunning scarlet seeds pods.   The plants are remarkably architectural and can be used very effectively in the centre of island beds or at the back of the border. In frost free areas they are grown in large borders or allowed to naturalise in the back of the landscape. In frosty climates, the Castor Oil plant is one of the best ways to quickly create a tropical effect in the garden. This fast growing plant tends to grow straight up at first, developing branches later in the season to form a well-proportioned shrub with sturdy stems and a dense canopy. Plants can be pruned to limit the size, or may need staking if top heavy; otherwise this plant needs very little maintenance.  Temperatures below 10\u00b0C are tolerated for a short time, but growth is inhibited. The plant is killed when the temperature drops below 0\u00b0C.   The seeds, or \"beans\" (they are not true beans), are only produced where the growing season is long enough (140 to 180 days). The shiny, intricately mottled seeds are quite attractive, each with their own unique design in colours of black, gray, brown, yellow-brown, maroon and white. The intricately mottled seeds have a spongy caruncle at one end which helps absorb water for germination when planted. Seeds remain viable for 2 to 3 years.

Intenta imitar en tono la m\u00fasica religiosa cristiana. Las versiones posteriores, cantadas por humanos y Vocaloids contin\u00faan y agudizan estos problemas. Cuando decid\u00ed usarla, trat\u00e9 de disminuir algunos, sobre todo la falsa fon\u00e9mica que ning\u00fan hablante nativo de Lat\u00edn habr\u00eda producido; sintaxis imposible, l\u00e9xico inventado, y patr\u00f3n de entonaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s del Tailand\u00e9s que del Lat\u00edn.

Gracias a GumiMegpoid por la iniciativa; y a ella se la dedico. \n\nOs iusti meditabitur sapientiam,\nEt lingua eius loquetur indicium.\nBeatus vir qui suffert tentationem, \nQuoniqum cum probates fuerit accipient coronam vitae.\nKyrie, ignis divine, eleison.\nO quam sancta, quam serena,\nQuam benigna, quam amoena \nO castitatis lilium.\n\nLILIUM:  is the opening theme for the anime series Elfen Lied. Originally sung by Kumiko Noma.\nComposed by Yukio and Kondo. Kayo Konishi arranged the lyrics. \nOk. This is a very nice and melancholy song. It is in \"Latin\" but it is not Catullus, meaning it is rather  defective Latin. The lyrics are based on biblical passages in psalms and the epistle of James, and the renaissance hymn Ave Mundi Spes Maria. Possibly written or translated and transliterated by Konishi.\nIt aimed  to mimic a european church piece (christian), with a bit of pseudo-biblical lyrics.\nNoma, the singer of the original  is not a native speaker of a  romance language, that is, of Latin diachronically evolved after 2000 years. Human-sung and  Vocaloid versions continue these trends a bit uncritically. When I sequenced it, I tried to patch a few of the holes:  false phonemics, intonation patterns, etc. to a more \"Latin\" manner (this is what LATIN really means). I tried to follow how a Latin speaker would fit her singing into the sequence. Since I am a native speaker of Latin, evolved 2000 years (Spanish) and since I work in a Linguistic theory department, I think I have some of the resources for this. I think Gumi now sounds more like a native speaker of Latin did (though possibly not classical Latin). I used the vsq from AzuraLunar and the midi from the midi shrine as references, but not as a basis.

In this study we explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation. Drawing on a sample survey of undergraduate Facebook users, we examine a particular privacy-enhancing practice: having a friends-only Facebook profile. Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings may be integrated into the design of systems to facilitate interaction while enhancing individual privacy.\n\nFred Stutzman and Jacob Kramer-Duffield\nSchool of Information and Library Science\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nOriginal source from Prelinger Archive (Public Domain): http://www.archive.org/details/Friendsh1949", "title": "Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-Enhancing Behavior in Facebook", "publishedDate": "2010-03-05T20:08:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Bzg7UoF7lQ", "description": "A Spaghetti Western Movie \"The Big Gundown\" (La Resa dei Conti) 1966.

Via a mathematical derivation and simulation results, the channel impulse response (CIR) of the fast fading channel is modeled as a linear function of time during a radio burst in the EDGE system. Therefore, a least-squares-based method is proposed along with the modified burst structure for time-varying channel estimation. Given that the pilot-symbol blocks are located at the front and the end of the data block, the LS-based method is able to estimate the parameters of the time-varying CIR accurately using a linear interpolation. The proposed time-varying estimation algorithm does not cause an error floor that existed in the adaptive algorithms due to a nonideal channel tracking. Besides, the time-varying CIR in the EDGE system is not in its minimum-phase form, as is required for low-complexity reducedstate equalization methods. In order to maintain a good system performance, a Cholesky-decomposition method is introduced in front of the reduced-state equalizer to transform the time-varying CIR into its minimum-phase equivalent form. Via simulation results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is very well suited for the time-varying channel estimation and equalization, and a good bit-error-rate performance is achieved even at high Doppler frequencies up to 300 Hz with a low complexity.", "title": "Fast Time-Varying Dispersive Channel Estimation and Equalization for an 8-PSK Cellular System.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-04-10T06:40:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6C54D69YLAc", "description": "Tea and liquor have become fast friends on drink menus that blend part high tea and part happy hour all into one.

But that was before Frederick Winslow Taylor brought his stopwatch onto the shop floor. Yet the man who thought everything should run like clockwork was also a quirky cross-dresser who spent the last years of life in ignominy, studying the growth of grass. The story of Taylor's rise, fall and phoenix-like rise again is a tale of conflicting ideologies, labor-management disputes and strikes, Congressional investigations and, ultimately, great human drama.\n\nBy 1910 Taylor's ideas had taken hold of American and he became a household name. Housewives adopted his scientific management principles, rearranging their kitchens to \"save steps\" and to be more efficient. Scholars and labor experts featured in Stopwatch discuss the impact of Taylorism on many social activities, including the management homes, farms, businesses, churches, philanthropic institutions and government. Trotsky, Lenin and Mussolini all embraced Taylor's theories, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis hailed him as brilliant. But a workers' strike in Watertown, Massachusetts and a subsequent Congressional investigation into Taylor's management system put his ideas to a severe test.\n\nBitter and angry after enduring the long Congressional investigation process, Taylor finally withdrew from the public arena. Though Taylor himself died a broken and discouraged man, labor leaders could not stem the tide of \"Taylorism\" or the efficiency movement. From auto-production plants that plan each task workers perform to fire fighting companies that use Taylor's theories to reduce their response time, Taylorism permeates the modern workplace.

We are using 21 and 27oz jigs to get down 100-200' and fish the drop off ledges of reef structure for monster lingcod and red snapper.  These jigs can reach bottom fast and remain vertical beneath the boat while drifting with moderate winds or currents.\n\nWe are fishing the jigs with penn330Gti reels, 80lb tuff line, and ugly stick rods.\n\nThe best technique is to lower the jig to the bottom, reel up a few turns quickly to avoid snagging bottom, then jig aggressively.  \n\nMore often than not the lingcod will strike the lure as its falling, on its initial drop, as soon as it reaches the bottom.\n\nA firm hookset is recommended.  The fish often bite the lure body so the firm hookset will ensure the hooks stick.\n\nFor more information goto www.FishingBC.COM\n\nI hope this video is of value to you.

He  has an estimated net worth of $20 billion. Hassanal Bolkiah is one of the world\u2019s richest and has been head of state since 1967. Since 2009 his fortune hasn\u2019t change according to Forbes magazine. He and Brunei weathered global recession with conservative economic policies and currency pegged to Singapore\u2019s. But oil production is slowing and reserves are expected to last only 25 years, so the priority is aimed at trying to diversify the economy.\n\nThe sultan continues to spend lavishly: in 2010 reportedly purchased 48 handbags, 24 \u201cduck\u201d umbrellas from Lederer de Paris shop in New York . The case against his brother Prince Jefri, accused of pilfering $15 billion from sultanate, remains in courts. The Sultan is famous for his vast automobile collection. It has been said that he has at least 7,000 cars and has bought over $789 million worth of high-performance cars.\n\nThe number purchased by his business interests and the number actually used by himself and his family differ greatly. According to Guinness World Records the Sultan\u2019s personal private collection has more than 600 Rolls-Royces, more than 450 Ferraris, and 134 Koenigseggs \u2014 the largest collection of that brand in the world. During the 1990s, his family accounted for almost half of all Rolls-Royce purchases, bulk buying slightly modified vehicles for diplomats and adding unique cars to their own collection. He also owns the very last Rolls-Royce Phantom VI, a 1992 state landaulette.\n\nThe Istana Nurul Iman palace, is Sultan\u2019s official residence, provides visitors a spectacular sight. It is the biggest palace in the world, much bigger than the Vatican palace. US$ 350 million was spent in erecting the palace. It has 1788 rooms, 257 bathrooms and the total floor area is 2,152,782 sq. feet.\nsultan of brunei sultan brunei brunei sultan sultan de brunei sultan of brunei net worth the sultan of brunei kekayaan sultan brunei sultan of brunei car collection sultan of brunei palace richest person of the world anak sultan brunei sultan von brunei sultan of brunei wealth sultan brunei cars brunei sultan cars isteri sultan brunei brunei sultan palace sultan of brunei house sultanate of brunei brunei sultan car collection sultan of brunei palace pictures sultan of brunei harem kereta sultan brunei sultan hassanal bolkiah cars sultan van brunei sultan of brunei wives sultan brunei car collection sultan brunei palace richest person of world brunei sultan wealth the richest people richest person of the world 2013 the richest person sultan of brunei plane rumah sultan brunei harta sultan brunei adik sultan brunei sultan brunei wealth sultan of brunei son brunei sultan house sultan brunei house brunei sultan net worth sultan brunei net worth sultan of brunei wiki sultan of brunei king of luxury anak anak sultan brunei sultan brunei harem brunei sultan car brunei sultan car list sultan of brunei car list the sultan of brunei net worth how much is the sultan of brunei worth sultan of brunei worth how rich is the sultan of brunei sultan brunei wife sultan of brunei garage gambar sultan brunei brunei independence brunei oil reserves cars of sultan of brunei sultan of brunei cars collection sultan of brunei hassanal bolkiah hassanal bolkiah sultan of brunei brunei sultan wiki prince of brunei net worth sultan hassanal brunei sultanate sultan brunei wives isteri isteri sultan brunei sejarah sultan brunei sultan brunei son sultan of brunei wife harta kekayaan sultan brunei kisah sultan brunei rich lists sultan of brunei car car collection of sultan of brunei palace of sultan of brunei brunei sultan house photos brunei sultan hassanal bolkiah hassan al bolkiah cars brunei richest man sultan brunei family images of brunei richest sultan prince bolkiah brunei sultan property brunei sultan plane brunei sultan wives brunei sultan harem sultan of brunei women sultans of brunei kemewahan sultan brunei sultan of brunei rolls royce sultan brunei dan isteri wealth of sultan of brunei cucu sultan brunei sultan of brunei daughter nama sultan brunei sultan of brunei 747 sultan of brunei children sultan of brunei palace interior net worth of sultan of brunei brunei hassanal bolkiah sultan bolkiah brunei sultan hassanal bolkiah of brunei", "title": "Brunei Sultan Wealth", "publishedDate": "2014-09-08T11:49:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6CFrY-Z1Wno", "description": "Evening traffic on the Via Del Corso, Rome.", "title": "viadelcorso.AVI", "publishedDate": "2010-02-28T14:33:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6CH05cuHh20", "description": "http://pulsetv.com/emailpromotion.asp?key=YOUTUBE&dest=http://www2.pulsetv.com/prodinfo.asp?number=6521\n\nEver wanted to know exactly how far you've walked without having to look at a screen or calculate the distance?

Cabeza con cresta, garganta y cuello enteramente rojos. Dos franjas blancas en el dorso debido a la base de la barba interna de las primarias y la base interna de las secundarias de color blanco. Pico negro y patas negras. \nLa hembra similar al macho, pero completamente negra y s\u00f3lo las plumas que rodean la base del pico de color rojo.\nPor sus colores y tama\u00f1o es imposible confundirlo con otra especie. La cresta es un poco m\u00e1s grande en la hembra y est\u00e1 compuesta por varias plumas largas satinadas que al erguirse, se doblan hacia adelante. \nAnida de preferencia en troncos verticales podridos, en donde taladran con su pico un hoyo redondeado a una altura de unos 15 a 20 mts. del suelo.

Its common names include passion fruit (US), passionfruit (UK and Commonwealth), and purple granadilla (South Africa).\n\nIt is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet, seedy fruit and is widely grown in several countries of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, Southern Asia, Australia, Hawaii and United States.\n\nThe passion fruit is round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds.  The fruit is both eaten and juiced; passion fruit juice is often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma.\n\nSeveral distinct varieties of passion fruit with clearly differing exterior appearances exist. The bright yellow flavicarpa variety, also known as the Golden Passion Fruit, can grow up to the size of a grapefruit, has a smooth, glossy, light and airy rind, and has been used as a rootstock for the Purple Passion Fruit in Australia.  The dark purple edulis variety is smaller than a lemon, though it is less acidic than the yellow passion fruit, and has a richer aroma and flavour.\n\nSeveral varieties of passion fruit are rich in polyphenol content, and yellow varieties of the fruit were found to contain prunasin and other cyanogenic glycosides in the peel and juice.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Terminada alrededor del a\u00f1o 2570 a. C., fue construida para el fara\u00f3n Keops (padre de Kefr\u00e9n y abuelo de Micerenios). Ubicada en Guiza, Egipto, es la \u00fanica de las siete maravillas del mundo antiguo que a\u00fan se puede contemplar.\n\nLos Jardines Colgantes de Babilonia.Hacia el a\u00f1o 600 A. C., Nabucodonosor II, rey de los caldeos, quiso hacer a su esposa Amytis, hija del rey de los medos, un regalo que demostrara su amor por ella y le recordara las hermosas monta\u00f1as de su florida tierra, tan diferentes de las grandes llanuras de Babilonia. Construidos durante los a\u00f1os605 a. C.-562 a. C. Ubicados en la ciudad de Babilonia, actual Irak. Perduraron hasta no m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de 126 a. C., cuando la ciudad fue destruida definitivamente por los persas.\n\nEl Templo de Artemisa en \u00c9feso (actual Turqu\u00eda). Tambi\u00e9n conocido como Artemision, fue construido hacia 550 a. C. y destruido por un incendio intencionado en 356 a. C., provocado por un griego llamado Er\u00f3strato. Alejandro Magno orden\u00f3 su reconstrucci\u00f3n, culminada tras su muerte en el a\u00f1o 323 a. C. Este nuevo templo, que debe ser considerado como el incluido dentro de la lista de las maravillas, fue destruido a su vez por los godos durante un saqueo en el a\u00f1o 262. El emperador Justiniano I utiliz\u00f3 algunas columnas helen\u00edsticas del Templo de Artemisa en \u00c9feso para la construcci\u00f3n del tercer edificio (construcci\u00f3n actual) de Santa Sof\u00eda en Estambul.\n\nLa Estatua de Zeus en Olimpia. Esculpida hacia 430 a. C. por Fidias. Ubicada en el interior del templo dedicado al propio Zeus en Olimpia, Grecia, desapareci\u00f3 entre 393, a\u00f1o en que el emperador Teodosio el Grande prohibi\u00f3 el culto pagano, y 426, en que Teodosio II orden\u00f3 la demolici\u00f3n de los monumentos de Olimpia.\n\nEl Mausoleo de Halicarnaso. Construido hacia 353 a. C. y situado en la ciudad griega de Halicarnaso, actual Bodrum (Turqu\u00eda). Se mantuvo en pie a lo largo de los siglos, pero una serie de terremotos hizo que hacia 1404 ya hubiera quedado reducido a ruinas.\n\nEl Coloso de Rodas. Construido entre 294 a. C. y 282 a. C. Ubicado a la entrada del puerto de la ciudad de Rodas en la isla de Rodas, Grecia, fue derribado por un terremoto en el a\u00f1o 223 a. C., por lo que fue la m\u00e1s ef\u00edmera de las maravillas.\n\nEl Faro de Alejandr\u00eda. Construido entre 285 a. C. y 247 a. C. en la isla de Pharos, en Alejandr\u00eda (Egipto), para guiar a los nav\u00edos que se dirig\u00edan al puerto de la ciudad. Al igual que la tumba de Mausolo dio nombre gen\u00e9rico a todos los grandes monumentos funerarios que la siguieron, la torre de Faros (Pharos) hizo lo propio con las torres de se\u00f1ales para la navegaci\u00f3n. El Faro perdur\u00f3 hasta que los terremotos de 1303 y 1323 lo redujeron a escombros; en el a\u00f1o 1480, sus restos fueron reutilizados en la construcci\u00f3n de una fortaleza cercana.\n\n\nS\u00edguenos \u00a1AHORA MISMO! desde:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/156366197751461\n- Twitter: http://twitter.com/arqhyscom\n- Google +: https://plus.google.com/115196599615670090931\n\nCr\u00e9ditos:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEl contenido de imagen utilizado en este video ha sido colaborado por nuestros usuarios.

Decay of the function and number of powerhouses that generate energy in each cell. Decay that occurs because the enormous amount of energy generated by mitochondria exposes them to constant free radical attack.\n\nUntil now, supplements that helped stave off mitochondrial decay were limited to nutrients that promoted more youthful energy output of existing mitochondria. \n\nPQQ ... pyrroloquinoline quinone ... has changed that. \n\nThis essential nutrient is a potent antioxidant that not only protects existing mitochondria, but also triggers the growth of brand new mitochondria in aging cells. \n\nSo naturally Life Extension\u00ae has enhanced its comprehensive Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer formula by adding BioPQQ\u2122 ... the highest quality PQQ available on the market today. But PQQ is just the beginning of this remarkable formula. There are six other important ingredients as well.\n\nAnd three of them are anti-glycation agents. The first is carnosine. You see, as we age our proteins become irreversibly damaged when sugar attaches to them. This glycation reaction destroys the protein's structure and eventually disrupts its normal function. Carnosine stops sugar from attaching to critical cell proteins.\n\nThe second is benfotiamine ... a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1. Benfotiamine can activate glucose metabolism and promote already healthy blood glucose levels. When you metabolize sugar better, it's unavailable for glycation. \n\nPyridoxal 5'-phosphate... the active form of vitamin B6 ... is the third. It's been shown to protect against both lipid and protein glycation reactions.\n\nIn addition, we have luteolin ... a super-potent plant extract that helps with the inflammation involved in nearly every undesirable consequence of aging. Culprits behind inflammatory reactions are pro-inflammatory cytokines. And luteolin suppresses them.\n\nMitochondrial Energy Optimizer with BioPQQ\u2122 also includes R-lipoic acid an antioxidant essential to fighting the free radicals generated by cellular energy production. And finally, acetyl-L-carnitine arginate is needed to transport fats into the mitochondria to be burned as cellular energy.\n\nNow, taking all of these ingredients separately would be cost-prohibitive. But you can get them all in one comprehensive, affordable formulation ... Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer with BioPQQ.\u2122  It's light-years ahead of anything else you'll find ... because Life Extension designed it to promote mitochondrial structure, function and formation.\n\nFor more info, please visit http://lef.org\n\nThese statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. \n\nThis product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.", "title": "Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer with BioPQQ\u2122 | Life Extension", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T19:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6CrTIS9YYCg", "description": "Writer and comedian Stephen Fry discusses the dangers of mass surveillance, calling for a campaign to urge governments around the world to curtail their monitoring of private data.

Thanks so much for commenting so quickly on the last episode. It made me so happy[: Here's the next one. 5 comments for the next one! \n\n\"You don't wanna go out with someone like me. I get it.\" Joe said as he pushed his chair back, got up from his seat, and started walking towards the door. \"JOE, WAIT! You didn't let me finish. I was going to say, I can't commit to anything until I find someone who can watch Nick for the night.\" I told him. \"Oh,\" Joe said looking down at the ground trying to hide that fact that he was embarrassed. \"Joe, how could you think I wouldn't want to go out with 'someone like you?' I think whoever 'someone like you' is an amazing guy that I really want to get to know. If anything, I would think you wouldn't want to go out with someone like me.\" I told him because that is honestly what I thought. \"Miley, how could you think that?! I think you're one of the prettiest, funniest, coolest, most down to earth girl I've ever met. It's an honor to be seen with you. This may sound crazy since we've only know each other for two weeks but I like you. And I don't mean like you, I mean liiike you.\" After he said those words, he gave me the cutest grin I'd ever seen. I had butterflies in my stomach, I liked Joe and Joe liked me. I didn't have to take the first step, he said it on his own. And he already knew I had a son so there less of a  risk in him leaving me because of that. I really like Joe and after all the sweet stuff he just said to me, I knew he deserved a chance. \"Joe, all that stuff you said to me was some of the sweetest things any guy has ever told me in my life. I would love to go on a date with you tomorrow night.\" I said. I could tell I had a giant grin on my face but I was happy and I wanted the whole world to know it. Joe and I slowly leaned in towards each other, our lips seconds away from touching when Nick returned from the bathroom. \"Momma, I want to go home now. Blue's Clues is on soon and I'm just DYING to know what happens!\" Nick said. Joe and I quickly pulled away from each other. \"Um, well I guess we should get going then.\" I said, kind of upset that I didn't get the kiss I really wanted. \"Yeah, I guess we should.\" Joe said with a hint of disappointment in his voice. The three of us walked to the car and got in. Once again, Nick entertained us with his talkativeness. \"So, should I drop you off at the school to get your car?\" I asked Joe. \"Actually, I don't have a car at the moment. It's in the shop. I just walk, it's only like three blocks away. So you can just drop me off at the school.\" Joe said. \"Joe, I'm not going to make you walk three blocks. Just tell me where you live and I'll drop you off.\" I told him. \"Miley, come on. I don't want to be a burden on your afternoon.\" Joe replied. \"Just tell me Joe, it's no problem. I want to take you home.\" \"You're not going to make this easy are you?\" Joe joked. \"Nope, so where am I headed?\" I asked him again. \"58 Maple Crest Road.\" Joe told me. \"No way! Nick and I live right down the road on Parker Street!\" I said a little too excited. Joe laughed a little. \"Well, what do you know? We're practically neighbors.\" Joe said. Five minutes later I pulled into Joe's driveway and he slowly opened his door. \"Thank you for the fun afternoon Mr. Jonas.\" Nick said. \"Oh, it was my pleasure bud. Have a good weekend and take care of your mom.\" Joe told Nick. Nick gave Joe a little salute. \"And Miley, I'll see you tomorrow. I can't wait for our date. Pick you up at 7.\" Joe said adding in a wink before heading into his house. I looked down and blushed before driving down the street to my house. \"Oooh, mommy's got a boyfriend.\" Nick said in a sing-song tone. I chuckled and thought to myself, 'Oh, how I wish that was true.", "title": "There for You - A Jiley/Joley Story Episode Eight", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T01:32:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6D0SxOP_-3k", "description": "Happy new years!

This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment. Many women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene or Metformin therapy will respond when these medications are reintroduced to the system after ovarian drilling.

He was wearing his work clothes and carried two bags, which he later explained contained his lunch.\n\nWhile she had no description of a possible suspect, the cop thought he looked suspicious. She ordered Stucky to sit on the curb and prepared to search him.  That's when Westby rushed to his side.\n\nAs a second officer pulled up to the scene in his police cruiser, the attorney demanded to know why her handyman of 30 years was being searched.\n\n\"I'm an attorney and this is wrong. Now please leave our neighborhood,\" she said. \"He works for us. He's been in this neighborhood for 30 years.\"\n\nWestby asked the cops which address they were responding to.\n\nThey answered: 4602 Foxhall Crescent.\n\nThey stopped Stucky in the 4500 block.  \"That house isn't even in this neighborhood,\" Westby said in the video.\n\nWhile the two blocks are close in number, the subdivision's curvy, unlinked streets meant the home in question was three-quarters of a mile away.\n\nWestby appealed to the second officer, while the first \u2014 still demanding Stucky sit on the curb \u2014 claimed the 64-year-old was loud and unruly when she attempted to search him.\n\n\"That's because you're accusing him,\" Westby explained.\n\nFinally, the cop in the car let Stucky go. Westby helped the man up, but the first officer wasn't convinced. She demanded the two stop, an order Westby ignored. The lawyer collected a business card from the cops and told them she's be reporting their actions.\n\nLater, police would realize there wasn't even a robbery: The call to police was made automatically by a resident's home alarm system because the homeowner accidentally mistyped his garage code, the Washington Post explained.", "title": "WHITE Attorney OUTRAGED When D.C.

There are many regional and local variations. It is a Piper betle leave chew, chewed as a palate cleanser, a breath freshener, and for digestive purposes as well. It is offered to guests and visitors as a sign of hospitality (after meals at both personal and social occasions) and at the beginning of social events. It has a symbolic value at ceremonies and cultural events in India and southeast Asia. Paan makers may use mukhwas or tobacco in paan fillings. Most paan contains areca nuts as a filling. Other types include what is called sweet paan, where sugar, candied fruit and multi-colored, sweetened, candy-like fennel seeds are used.\n\nChewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf is a tradition, custom or ritual which dates back thousands of years from India to the Pacific. Ibn Battuta describes this practice as follows: \"The betel is a tree which is cultivated in the same manner as the grape-vine; ... The betel has no fruit and is grown only for the sake of its leaves ... The manner of its use is that before eating it one takes areca nut; this is like a nutmeg but is broken up until it is reduced to small pellets, and one places these in his mouth and chews them. Then he takes the leaves of betel, puts a little chalk on them, and masticates them along with the betel.\"", "title": "Indian Paan- Louise and Stuart's Amazing India", "publishedDate": "2010-09-16T01:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DaU5iQJQbA", "description": "http://reasonprep.com/sat-grammar-bootcamp/\n\nCheck out this page or the Youtube playlist for a full review of the grammar rules and concepts that are tested on the SAT.\n\nWhen comparing two or more nouns, you need to make sure you are using the right \"comparing words\" - aka the comparitive and superlative.", "title": "#25 - Comparative & Superlative, SAT Grammar Bootcamp", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20T00:03:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DalIh9Al98", "description": "Internalz Pro has safeguards put in place so you can't destroy your system.

Consisting of siblings Ronny, Kenny, Larry and Yvonne, they first sang together in 1967 after being asked to sing during revival services at a small church in Freedom, California. Though they had never sung together as a unit, they soon found themselves a popular favorite in churches and concert appearances along the west coast of the United States. Initially, thy were known as The Singing Hinson Family. However, as time and their popularity progressed they became known simply as The Hinsons. Later, they were known as The Original Hinsons to distinguish themselves from Bo Hinsons' group, The New Hinsons now known as The Hinsons.\nYounger brother Larry tells the story behind the Hinsons signature song: \"It was written in 1970, in the downstairs bathroom of a church then called \"The Pentecostal Tabernacle.\" We had been rehearsing songs that Saturday evening and found the necessity to have new material to stage. Ronny disappeared for several minutes, only to return to the church sanctuary brandishing a long fluttering piece of toilet paper. The title of the song was none other than \"The Lighthouse.\" It was first recorded the next year by The Goodmans and then by The Hinsons. Songs of Calvary and Journey Music, (then owned by Rusty Goodman,) co-published the song. Elvis recorded it soon thereafter...\" 'The Lighthouse' quickly became a huge hit in southern gospel and remains one of the most recorded songs in the genre. From 1973 till 1980 The Hinsons were the co-hosts of the popular television show The Gospel Singing Jubilee. Although the Hinsons were an extremely popular touring group with excellent record sales, they were considered radical for their concert style, which was far more ministry oriented than most of the more established professional groups. Always innovators, the group recorded several albums in the mid 1970s with an eclectic mix of songs that weren't considered true southern gospel. Songs like 'Shinin' In' and 'Look what He's done for me,' had a decidedly contemporary feel, while others such as 'This Joy is Mine' had an undeniably country sound.\nThe family disbanded the group in 1988, but Larry Hinson approached their record producer at Calvary Music Group, suggesting a reunion project involving the original four founding Hinson members. They reunited one final time for One More Hallelujah which was completed in the fall of 1992. The album featured the song \"Joy Comes In The Morning,\" and spurred the 13 city One More Hallelujah Tour in 1993. The tour was cut short when lead singer, Kenny Hinson was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He died on July 27, 1995 at the age of 41.\nRonny, the eldest of the Hinson brothers, is a renowned songwriter, having written over 10 #1 songs on the southern gospel charts, and over 100 songs that charted in the top 10. He is also a sought after producer, and continues to perform.", "title": "The Hinsons-It All Still Amazes Me.avi", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T05:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Dejy7LEDYE", "description": "*************************LESEN**********************************\n\n\n\n\nVlog Kanal: http://www.youtube.com/DorientsWorld\n\nGesangsKanal:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Lamiyah\n\nFolgt mir auf Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/thedorient\n\nFacebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheDorient\n\nFacebookApp: http://apps.facebook.com/thedorient/\n\nBlogspot:\nhttp://www.thedorient.blogspot.com\n\nxoxo Lamiya", "title": "Red Eyecatcher - Outfit of the Night (for events,parties)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-07T09:37:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DeqN5CaPNY", "description": "Radio imaging sweeper sound effects for epic pauses and breaks.\n\nSounds under CC-BY 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ :\n\nBy kennysvoice http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/\nripbeepbounce.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158407/\nWipee5.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158406/\nbeestinger.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158405/\nMyBelch.wav http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158443/\nStatic Wipee.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158402/\nWipee1.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158401/\nWipee3.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158400/\nWipee4.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158399/\nwipenthump.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158398/\nwinencrunch.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158393/\nziptoboom.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158392/\nSiz_Boom.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158391/\nSkid1.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158390/\nHi_Thump.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158373/\nPunch.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158372/\nRize1.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158371/\nRize2.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158370/\nBipBip_Boom.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158361/\nDial.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158360/\nEErie Wipe.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158359/\nExciteStart.mp3 http://freesound.org/people/kennysvoice/sounds/158358/\n\nSounds under CC0 http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ :\n\nBy Lisnmusic http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/\nDigital 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122083/\nWhoosh 1 Flange.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122082/\nDigital 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122081/\nGeneric 4.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122080/\nGeneric 3.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122079/\nGeneric 2.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122078/\nGeneric 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122077/\nDramatic 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122076/\nDigital 6.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122075/\nDigital 5.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122074/\nDigital 4.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122073/\nDigital 3.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122072/\nDigital 2.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122071/\nDigital 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122070/\nDigital 2.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122069/\nDigital 1.wav http://freesound.org/people/Lisnmusic/sounds/122068/\n\nImage by Feindblut under CC-BY 3.0 from http://feindblut.deviantart.com/art/Plague-PSD-315314882", "title": "Radio Imaging Sound Effects [Free High Quality Download]", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T06:31:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DfvpJ5NS4Q", "description": "Beck stumps Palin on FOX.  mobile video cellphone Haiti Earthquake CNN Breaking News 7.0 Magnitude Quake uploaded from my phone wyclef red cross tweet twitter text live relief clinton obama sympathy bush video uploaded from my mobile phone", "title": "Beck stumps Palin: Who's favorite Founding Father?

The film takes place in ancient times, when a mighty swordsman, Memnon (Steven Brand, making his film debut) ruled over nearly all the known world. Memnon, a brutal tyrant, defeats his enemies in battle with the help of a beautiful sorceress, Cassandra (Kelly Hu), who can predict the future. The last of the \"free tribes\" form a fragile alliance to fight Memnon, and hire a trio of Akkadian assassins, led by Mathayus (pro wrestler The Rock, who made his big-screen debut as this character in The Mummy Returns), to kill the sorceress and thus remove Memnon's advantage. Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan of The Green Mile), the powerful leader of the Nubians, objects to hiring mercenaries, but the plan goes forward. The assassins are betrayed by Takmet (Peter Facinelli), the son of one of the tribal leaders, and Mathayus finds himself unable to kill Cassandra. Thanks to the unlikely machinations of Cassandra, and the aid of a horse thief, Arpid (Grant Heslov of True Lies), Mathayus escapes to the desert. He eventually abducts Cassandra, who explains that Memnon was holding her against her will. Mathayus thwarts Memnon's efforts to re-capture Cassandra, then uses his newfound sense of justice to convince the surviving tribal leaders to join forces again to defeat Memnon. The Scorpion King was directed by Chuck Russell. Jonathan Hales (Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones) was credited with the story, and WWF owner Vince McMahon has an executive producer credit. The film, which was shot in the U.S. (very unusual for a big action film), reportedly underwent extensive re-shoots when the first cut came in with a running time of 70 minutes.\n\n\"the scorpion king\",\"the scorpion king clip\",\"the scorpion king 3\",\"the scorpion king 3 trailer\",\"dwayne johnson\",\"michael clarke duncan\",\"grant heslov\",\"kelly hu\",\"bernard hill\",\"tutu sweeney\",\"sherri howard\",\"chuck russell\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",adventure,fantasy,\"josh mclaglen\",\"kevin misher\",\"stephen sommers\",\"richard luke rothschild\",\"vince mcmahon\",\"michael tronick\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++260902,/m/02lkcc,/m/0bsb4j,/m/015t7v,/m/014g_s,/m/0gp_07,/m/03l7xc", "title": "The Scorpion King (9/9) Movie CLIP - Hail to the King (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T14:02:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DitHiXsDCY", "description": "", "title": "Antheraea yamamai  2", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T12:48:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6DiyWWXR0k0", "description": "Foreign language learning needs a clear sensory focus for eye and ear!\nThe eye needs to see the foreign language and the mother language in one focus right underneath each other. \nThe ear needs to hear the word of the foreign language and the word of the own language almost interrupting each other.\nLike this the two languages fuse in the brain.

Dia masuk Islam setelah kagum dengan ayat-ayat Al-Quran tentang masa iddah wanita muslimah selama tiga bulan. Massa iddah merupakan massa tunggu perempuan selama tiga bulan, selama proses dicerai suaminya.\n \nSeperti dikutip dari societyberty.com, hasil penelitian yang dilakukannya menunjukkan, massa iddah wanita sesuai dengan ayat-ayat yang tercantum di Alquran. Hasil studi itu menyimpulkan hubungan intim suami istri menyebabkan laki-laki meninggalkan sidik khususnya pada perempuan.\n \nDia mengatakan jika pasangan suami istri (pasutri) tidak bersetubuh, maka tanda itu secara perlahan-lahan akan hilang antara 25-30 persen. Gelhem menambahkan, tanda tersebut akan hilang secara keseluruhan setelah tiga bulan berlalu. Karena itu, perempuan yang dicerai akan siap menerima sidik khusus laki-laki lainnya setelah tiga bulan.\n\nBukti empiris ini mendorong pakar genetika Yahudi ini melakukan penelitian dan pembuktian lain di sebuah perkampungan Muslim Afrika di Amerika. Dalam studinya, ia menemukan setiap wanita di sana hanya mengandung sidik khusus dari pasangan mereka saja.\n\nPenelitian serupa dilakukannya di perkampungan nonmuslim Amerika. Hasil penelitian membuktikan wanita di sana yang hamil memiliki jejak sidik dua hingga tiga laki-laki. Ini berarti, wanita-wanita non-muslim di sana melakukan hubungan intim selain pernikahannya yang sah.\n\nSang pakar juga melakukan penelitian kepada istrinya sendiri. Hasilnya menunjukkan istrinya ternyata memiliki tiga rekam sidik laki-laki alias istrinya berselingkuh. Dari penelitiannya, hanya satu dari tiga anaknya saja berasal dari dirinya.\n \nSetelah penelitian-penelitian tersebut, dia akhirnya memutuskan untuk masuk Islam. Ia meyakini hanya Islam lah yang menjaga martabat perempuan dan menjaga keutuhan kehidupan sosial. Ia yakin bahwa perempuan muslimah adalah yang paling bersih di muka bumi ini.\n\n kidung love jesus hari paskah bapa di surga roh kudus mimpi malam alkitab rohani yesus natal cinta lagu gereja  kidung love jesus hari paskah bapa di surga roh kudus mimpi malam alkitab rohani kesaksian kedamaian kebenaran kemenangan katolik protestan Indonesia faithfreedom org saksian kedamaian kebenaran kemenangan katolik protestan Indonesia faithfreedom org\n\n\nkasih sayang yesus natal cinta lagu gereja nubuat kidung love jesus hari paskah bapa di surga roh kudus mimpi malam alkitab rohani kesaksian kedamaian kebenaran kemenangan katolik protestan Indonesia faithfreedom org", "title": "Wow ...

It is debateable which is easier or more difficult to learn.\n\nThe big challenges with Chinese are pronunciation: Mandarin has four tones and Cantonese has six tone contours, and Chinese characters, you have to learn a lot of individual characters and their pronunciations are often not closely related to how they look. You just have to learn them.\n\nJapanese is arguably easier to pronounce, but many people say that it has a much more complicated grammar than Chinese. Also, as well as using some Chinese characters, Japanese has two sets of syllabaries, effectively two alphabets, which it uses alongside Chinese. They are easier to learn than Chinese characters, but still take some getting used to.\n\nSo which language is easier to learn? Well, both Chinese and Japanese demand a lot of persistence and effort for English speakers, but many people argue that Japanese is easier to get started with and becomes more difficult later, whereas Chinese is really tough at the beginning, and gets easier as time goes on. But, perhaps a more relevant question is, which culture and which language are you most interested in? My best advice would be to just follow your interest.
