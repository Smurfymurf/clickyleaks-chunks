The R-rated comedy takes the traditional body-switching movie, ties it up tightly and throws it off a cliff. Growing up together, Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) were inseparable best friends, but as the years have passed they've slowly drifted apart. While Dave is an overworked lawyer, husband and father of three, Mitch has remained a single, quasi-employed man-child who has never met a responsibility he liked. To Mitch, Dave has it all: beautiful wife Jamie (Leslie Mann), kids who adore him and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. To Dave, living Mitch's stress free life without obligation or consequence would be a dream come true. Following a drunken night out together, Mitch and Dave's worlds are turned upside down when they wake up in each other's bodies and proceed to freak the &*#@ out. Despite the freedom from their normal routines and habits, the guys soon discover that each other's lives are nowhere near as rosy as they once seemed. Further complicating matters are Dave's sexy legal associate, Sabrina (Olivia Wilde), and Mitch's estranged father (Alan Arkin). With time not on their side, Mitch and Dave comically struggle to avoid completely destroying each other's lives before they can find a way to get their old ones back.\n\nThis is the public available Trailer for the promotion of this film.\nvia: http://trailers.apple.com/", "title": "The Change-Up (2011) Movie Trailer HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-22T00:58:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "43QtgDhWhFQ", "description": "for more info you may visite us at http://baria-repairs.yolasite.com/services.php \nFor sale contact me @ psbaria@gmail.com", "title": "B-Samosa Machine 1", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T12:55:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "43RD1U_eabo", "description": "http://www.ippinka.com/shop/ceiling-mounted-drying-rack/", "title": "Ceiling Mounted Drying Rack", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T20:38:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "43SPKzRpWpM", "description": "Original : \ud0dc\uc591 (TAEYANG) - \ub208,\ucf54,\uc785 (EYES, NOSE, LIPS)", "title": "'\ub208,\ucf54,\uc785 (EYES, NOSE, LIPS) (Rap Ver.)' by EB", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T10:32:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "43U79B8vSg8", "description": "What blip.tv is doing is baffling, we need to do something about it now or it could end up worse then youtube in terms of trying to get a start. \n\nlink to petition: \nhttp://www.change.org/en-CA/petitions/blip-com-maker-studios-abandon-policy-changes-that-have-alienated-over-80-of-their-users\n\nlike, fav, and subscribe if you enjoyed and want to see more. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=megadrivesonic\n\nblog: http://dkunzcartoons.wordpress.com/\n\nfacebook page: http://www.facebook.com/DkunzCartoons\n\nTumblr: http://dkunzartcorner.tumblr.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/megadrivesonic", "title": "Blip TV purging newcomers", "publishedDate": "2014-06-19T02:45:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "43UBxPWf0L4", "description": "Castor & Pollux - Jean-Philippe Rameau\n\ntrag\u00e9die lyrique en un prologue et cinq actes\nChouers et danses\n\nHoward Crook (Castor)\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4meCorr\u00e9as (Pollux)\nAgn\u010ds Mellon (T\u00e9la\u010fre)\nV\u00e9ronique Gens (Ph\u00e9b\u00e9)\nSandrine Piau (Une Ombre / Une Plan\u010dte)\nMark Padmore (L'Amour)\nClaire Brua (Minevre)\nSophie Daneman (Un Plaisir)\nAdrian Brand, Jean-Claude Sarragosse (Deux Athl\u010dtes)\n\nLes Art Florissants\nDir.

Serrapeptase was proven to be a superior anti-flammatory agent in comparison to other proteolytic enzymes.  This is thought to be the result of its complete binding with Alpha 2 macroglobulin bio fluids\n\n\nProteolytic enzyme therapy is traced to contributions made by Max Wolf, author of the first endocrinology textbook.  When the book was published, endocrinology was very young.  Wolf, along with Benitez did most of their work in the years between 1930 and 1980.  They looked at enzyme combinations and the work did not have the strict control used today in research.  However, there were observations of the positive effects that enzyme therapy provided in cased of certain viral infections, vascular diseases, lymph edema and the healing of injuries and inflammations.  They were convinced that the primary cause of premature aging was a deficiency in proteolytic enzymes.  \n\nEnzymes such as these have shown themselves helpful with infections.  They are especially useful in UTI or urinary tract infections.  In European clinical investigations, use of antibiotic drugs along with systemic proteolytic enzymes provides a higher concentration of the antibiotic at the infection site, resulting in a more rapid cure.\n\nSerrapeptase is one example of these enzymes.  It is isolated using the microorganism Serratia E15.  This enzyme has been shown superior to others by providing specific anti-inflammatory effects.  In biological fluids, the enzyme binds completely to the alpha 2 macroglobulin.\n\nSufferers of RA (Rheumatoid arthritis) can also benefit from treatment using proteolytic enzymes.  The proteolytic enzymes offer help that avoids the potentially dangerous side effects of the normal drugs that are used to treat RA.\n\nAccording to studies of both animals and humans affected with RA, the use of the enzyme therapy allows for effective symptom management that rivals that of conventional drugs, but avoids the negative side effects.  In fact, these enzymes have practically no side effects.  Doctors that have experience with use of these enzymes in the treatment of RA report patients experience less pain and muscle atrophy, as well as better mobilization.\n\n\nSerrapeptase Dosage Information:\n-For general anti-swelling use: 1 -- 3  tablespoons on an empty stomach\n-For arterial occlusion use: 1 -- 3 tablespoons B.I.D\n\nSerrapeptase is currently available in:\n-90 capsules (enteric-coated). Tablets are equal to 80,000 IU each.\n-90 coated capsules with 350 mg MSM and 50 mg other minerals\n\nDisclaimer: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Presently, diabetes ranks as being the 8th leading killer in the world.\nCardiovascular disease. The world health organisation research also  concludes that heart disease is the cause of  between 50% to 80%  of deaths within the diabetic community. Therefore, according to 2004 figures of 374 million deaths by WHO is:-\n1. 187 million deaths are recorded because of diabetes based on 50% death rate.\n2. 299.2 million deaths due to heart disease on the higher percentage of 80%\nStroke can also be referred to as a brain attack. It occurs because the supply of blood to area of the brain gets cut off resulting in loss of memory along with loss of other bodily functions like walking and talking. The danger of a stroke for a person with diabetes is 2 or 3 times higher and more likely.\nKidney disease could affect anyone\u2019s life across the ages. The communities more prone to develop kidney disease were sighted as African, American, Hispanic & American Indians. For the most part, there was high incidence of diabetes and high blood pressure amongst such groups. But, as the diabetes is on the increase across the world. The whole world is equally at risk of  kidney disease/failure. Figures available suggest 44% of the people on dialysis are due to diabetes.\nBlindness. Diabetic retinopathy if the veins in the retina are damaged causing loss of vision or blindness. 40% to 45% of the American diabetic  population have  some level of retinopathy requiring regular monitoring or treatment even. \nLaser treatment can help repair the burst blood vessels in the retina and restore back and reverse several of the damage. But  laser treatment is very expensive  and due to that it is not available to everyone. \nOn the subject of blindness, people with diabetes are 10 to 20 times more prone to go blind than those without the condition.\nAmputations because of diabetes  is most common. The  2010 data  for UK below produces a startling reading:-\n1. 100 people 7 days lose a lower limb, toe or foot.\n2.  1 in 20 diabetics develop foot ulcer. And, 1 in 10 ulcers end in amputation.\n3.  Diabetics are 15 times prone to have a limb or toe amputated than those without diabetes.\n4. 70% death rate within 5 years post amputation.  \nFinally, these figures are a snapshot of the true devastation caused by diabetes. What is needed to counter-act the onslaught of this condition and its consequences  is more education, more awareness and more care.\nWhat should you do? \nWell, get help, keep yourself well-informed, make yourself more aware, be informed and stick to a tried and tested program.

So it's really your ribcage that defines the thoracic spine. \n\nThe thoracic spine is unique because the ribs stabilize the spine around your torso so it, in some ways, limits the range of motion. The thoracic spine can get misaligned from many different causes, including poor posture, poor sleeping positions, and repetitive stress injuries, sports injuries, even carrying heavy backpacks or other heavy loads in your arms or on your shoulders.\n\nThoracic pain can really be provoked by poor posture, and chiropractic adjustment is very effective at restoring the range of motion in the thoracic spine and even improving posture.\n\nThere are many ways that your chiropractor can adjust your thoracic spine. Usually it's done while you're lying on your stomach, and it's just a very gentle pressure, very specific pressure on the thoracic spine to restore normal motion in the vertebrae. But sometimes these adjustments can be done while you're sitting or even in other positions very effectively.\n\nChiropractors will also adjust the ribs that attach to the thoracic spine. And this rib pain can be very, very specific. Usually it's around the shoulder blade area or a little higher. And sometimes it feels like there's a knife in your back, and a chiropractor can very carefully examine you and be sure that's what's causing your pain and adjust it very effectively, along with the thoracic spine, and it can reduce pain and inflammation and restore range of motion. \n\nAnd what my patients appreciate most is that their posture comes back more to normal.

Preludium from Partita-Meditation (2007)\n\nDedicated to Innovation Duo\n\nfrom the album \"Post Mortem\"\n\nInnovation Duo - Anna & Jakub Dzialak Savytsky\n\n\nEuropean audiences first heard of the Innovation Duo in 2004 when they performed \nP. de Sarasate's works at the Porto-Carras Festival (Greece). Since then, they have performed hundreds of concerts and their courageous repertoire strategy has already been confirmed by the extensiveness of their tours, the enthusiastic reviews, as well as a library of scores written especially for this extraordinary duo.\n\nThe violin duo is a distinct, elitist chamber genre, meant for a discriminating and exacting audience. With their unique skills and phenomenal energy, Anna Savytska and Jakub Dzialak have been able to win the hearts of thousands of listeners. These brilliant soloists, winners of numerous prestigious international competitions (Grazyna Bacewicz Prize 1995,\nAsahi Shinbun Prize 1996, Yfrah Neamann Prize 1997, Bela Bartok Prize 1997, \nViotti Prize 1999, Romano Romanini Prize 1999, Lorenzo Perosi Prize 2000, Vaclav Huml \nPrize 2001, Club Lion Prize 2002, P.de Sarasate Prize 2003, Thessaloniki Chambermusic \nPrize 2004 and 2006, Culturprize B\u00fclach 2006, Stravinsky Prize 2007, Gyorgy Cziffra \nPrize 2008, Geraldine Whittaker Prize 2010), with the rare intuition of partner-instrumentalists, scarcely have equals in the concert world today. Their virtuoso technique with a wealth of sound gradations and multi-facetted dynamics -- from the strong, dramatic forte to the mystical, hushed piano -- create a feeling of a multi-timbre orchestra in miniature.\n\nThe goal of the Innovation Duo is to embrace the whole duet-violin repertoire from the 16th to the 21st centuries, to give new birth to forgotten masterpieces of the Renaissance and Baroque and to interpret in their individual style Mozart's popular salon music as well as that of the romantic epochs. In addition, they hope to offer their own interpretations of modern experimental scores, written especially for the contemporary music festivals in Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Kosovo and Ukraine. Irreproachable taste, a perfect sense of style, charisma and the ability to create an illusion of dramatic dialogue between the instruments are the keystones to success ensuring a long and creative future for Anna Savytska and Jakub Dzialak.\n\nVideo made by Artem Shmahaylo for InMuSt Productions \n\n\u00a9 InMuSt Productions 2011", "title": "Bohdana Frolyak - I.

The people in the first group live within a half circle of 350m (1148 feet) radius from the transmitter, which came into service in July 1996.\n\nThe results were startling. Out of the 622 exposed patients, 8 cases of different kinds of cancer were diagnosed in a period of just one year (July 1997 to June 1998): 3 cases of breast cancer, one of ovarian cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin's disease (cancer of the lymphatic system), osteoid osteoma (bone tumour) and kidney cancer. \n\nThis compares with 2 per 1 222 in the matched controls of the nearby clinic. The relative risk of cancer was 4.15 for those living near the cell-phone transmitter compared with the entire population of Israel.\n\nWomen were more susceptible. As seven out of eight cancer cases were women, the relative cancer rates for females were 10.5 for those living near the transmitter station and 0.6 for the controls relative for the whole town of Netanya. One year after the close of the study, 8 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the microwave exposed area and two in the control area.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nBelarus, Minsk\nCity of Lithgow,  Australia\nNorman, Oklahoma\nTorrance, California\nBhutan, Thimphu\nArgentina, Buenos Aires City\nChesapeake, Virginia\nBroken Hill,  Australia\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates,  Abu Dhabi, UAE\n\nhttp://www.emfnews.org/qlinks.html\nhttp://www.emfnews.org/productinfo.html", "title": "Israel  Cell Tower Radiation Study: fourfold cancer risk", "publishedDate": "2010-05-27T15:41:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "44Bc9BSABf4", "description": "Just so WMG or whoever it is bans music on youtube is happy, \"No I don't own this song.

And what does it mean for a society to be unfair? Learn Liberty asked these questions to two professors -- a libertarian (Professor Steve Horwitz), and a Rawlsian philosopher (Professor Jeffrey Reiman) -- in a debate on inequality in America.   See the full debate: http://lrnlbty.co/10hObEh\n\nThe distribution of wealth in America is dramatically lopsided towards the 1% - a point vividly demonstrated in \"Wealth Inequality in America,\" and agreed upon by both professors. For many, there is something intuitively and philosophically unfair about this inequality. \"We are the 99%!\" is a mantra of Occupy Wall Street's dissatisfaction, and a protest against America's status quo.\n\n\"Wealth Inequality in America\" draws a striking picture, but is that the whole story? \n\nProfessor Horwitz says that \"Wealth Inequality in America\" misses a central point: do the poor in our society regularly lift themselves out of poverty? \"How easy is it, or how difficult is it, for folks who start off poor, to no longer be poor?\" \n\nCheck out the full debate to hear Professor Reiman's response to Horwitz's arguments about wealth in America: http://lrnlbty.co/10hObEh.\n\nFilmed at the 2013 International Students for Liberty Conference. https://www.studentsforliberty.com\n\nGet new videos by liking us on Facebook.

This channel discusses and reviews books, novels, and short stories through drawing...poorly. New Minute Book Reports are posted every week.\n\nThis is a story about a family who is planning a road trip from Georgia to Florida.  The grandmother, an old, talkative woman, really wants to go to Tennessee, but her son, Bailey, insists on Florida.  Despite the grandmother's warnings of an escaped prisoner, The Misfit, Bailey, the grandmother, Bailey's wife, and three children, John Wesley, June Star, and a newborn, pack up and head out to Florida.\n\nAs they are travelling, the grandmother mentions a nearby old house with treasure in it, which entices the family to investigate it and leave the road.  However, when the grandmother realizes that the house she is thinking of is in Tennessee and not Georgia, she gets startled, causing Bailey to lose control of the car.  The car tumbles off the back road and into a little ditch, but no one is hurt.\n\nAs they assess the damage to the car, the family is approached by another car with three men.  The men seem friendly, but are all carrying guns.  Quickly, the grandmother recognizes one of the men as The Misfit.  \n\nThe Misfit instructs his two partners to take Bailey and John Wesley in the nearby woods and shoot them. Then he instructs them to take Bailey's wife with the newborn and June Star in the woods and shoot them as well.  Meanwhile, the grandmother tells The Misfit that he's too good of a man to shoot an old lady.\n\nIn the end, The Misfit shoots the grandmother.\n\nThrough The Misfit, we see a person who has been worked by the prison system.  His mind is murky and his thoughts, while interesting, leave the grandmother and readers questioning themselves about religious and philosophical ideals.  \n\nBut more importantly, the system has affected The Misfit to the point where he doesn't truly remember why he was incarcerated.   Maybe time isn't the only thing that prisoners lose.  Maybe to be truly institutionalized means that one experiences change, yet fails to understand why.\n\nOne of the lingering questions at the end of the story is whether The Misfit is literally the grandmother's son or not.  The author could have presented this scenario as more symbolic, but there are clues in the story that support this notion.  Although not sure, The Misfit thinks that he was put in prison because he murdered his father, which does coincide with the absence of the grandmother's husband.\n\nAt the end of the story, the grandmother also refers to The Misfit as her son.  However, this could have been because he put on Bailey's blue shirt and she was beginning to panic.  And while it is established that the grandmother recognizes Bailey as her only son, because the grandmother is very judgemental and old fashioned, she could have disowned The Misfit for his criminal past, which does technically leave her with only one son. \n\nAs readers get to know the grandmother through prose and dialogue, she comes to represent a person who likes to live in the past.  At the start of the story, she wants to go to Tennessee to see some old acquaintances.  And while there is nothing wrong with that, she is so fixated with the past that the past is all she lives for.  \n\nAnd it's from the grandmother that readers get the message of the story: Don't live in the past.  Her comments about Blacks on the side of the road are derogatory and her conversation in the diner with the owner, while nostalgic, is an act of grasping for times that are no more.

Well, most of it is, anyway.\n\nThere are a few out there that could put a dent in even particularly lush grocery budgets.\n\nHere are 10 of the most expensive fruits in the world.\n\nNumber 10. Densuke watermelon. Praised for its unique sweetness, this melon also has a very distinctive look. All black and lacking stripes, this beauty is definitely a grocery store stand-out. At its price point, it should be. In 2008 a 17-pounder sold at auction for 61 hundred dollars. \n\nNumber 9. Pineapples from the Lost Gardens of Heligan. Thank goodness pineapples have thick skins, because these ones are grown under straw, horse urine, and manure. To be fair, they hail from chilly England, so extreme measures are warranted. They're given to staff as gifts, but their estimated value is 16 hundred dollars. \n\nNumber 8. Yubari King Melon. A serious amount of effort goes into making sure that these cantaloupes are perfect. Each vine is trimmed to limit its yield to one. Once sprouted, each melon is given a little hat to protect it from the sun. When picked the stems are trimmed to a tidy 'T' shape.  One ideal specimen pair fetched around 23 thousand dollars at auction.\n\nNumber 7. Taiyo-no-Tamago Mangoes. The going rate for these beauties is 3 thousand dollars. To be fair, the price is for a box that includes 2. To earn the special distinction, the individual fruits must weigh at least 12 ounces and be high in sugar. \n\nNumber 6. Ruby Roman grapes. They're perfectly round, extra sweet, and about the size of a ping pong ball, all of which are apparently extremely desirable qualities. People are willing to pay in excess of 4 thousand dollars to get their hands on a bunch.\n\nNumber 5. Square watermelons. Sure, it sounds cool, but is it over 800 dollars worth of awesome? That's the price some Russians have been known to pay for the Japanese melons. To achieve the unique shape, farmers grow the fruit in plastic containers. \n\nNumber 4. Dekopon citrus. A cross between a mandarin and an orange, the membranes between the sections are known for their thinness and melt-in-your mouth quality. The flavor keeps happy customers combing back as well, as they hit an ideal balance between sweet and tart. A pack of 6 runs around 80 dollars. \n\nNumber 3. Sekai-ichi apples. The making of the 21-dollar apple -- that's a piece, not per pound -- is far from left to nature. Fields are hand pollinated and each apple is washed in honey and hand stamped. \n\nNumber 2. Sembikiya Queen strawberries. Named for the swanky fruit store in Tokyo that sells them, each box of twelve is hand selected and perfectly matched. Even with a price tag of about 85 dollars, the retailer rings up at least 50 units a day. \n\nNumber 1. Buddha-shaped pears. Molds are placed on the pears as they grow from the trees, resulting in a piece of fruit that looks much like a small, decorative statue. People don't seem to mind the 9-dollar price, and rush to buy them as soon as they're picked.", "title": "World's 10 Most Expensive Fruits", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T12:14:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "44g-GMB0Zns", "description": "Burgerbar Greenbelt 2 Ayala Center Makati.

I realize I was being more than a bit silly and vague. Many theists have used dishonest argumentation with me, which no doubt causes them to suspect that I, too, am using dishonest argumentation (projection), which can ironically cause them to be skeptical about the wrong things. That was the point of the misdirection and subsequent alien.\n\nPretty pretty please check out my new channel!!!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/darkantics\n\nI believe it is wrong to harm others. That is my opinion, which is subject to change under different circumstances. Furthermore, even my definition of \"harm\" is subjective. While I believe indoctrination of children is causing harm, there are religious people who see it as vitally important. Our opinions don't get to decide ultimate truth, though. So who is objectively correct? Neither of us. It isn't so simply black or white. Is it better to know a harmful truth or to believe a comforting lie? Which is moral?\n\nIf the vast majority of us agree upon what is good or bad for human beings, for all intents and purposes, that can be like objective morality, and I could see how one could justifiably call it objective, but that's not entirely accurate, and I don't wish to call it objective because that implies transcendence, which is baseless. When something is objective, it is true independent of our minds, yet our minds are a requisite of morality. For morality to be objective, you must explain how morality continues to exist if humans cease to exist.\n\nLet's put it another way:\n\nMorality is an emergent property. It is contingent upon there being people who are interacting. If there are no people interacting, then the property of morality is not generated. Therefore it is not a property that exists in the world or universe independent of us. So who decides what morality is? We do.\n\nTektonTV made a response to this video which I cannot answer because he blocked me. I performed experiments on him in which I provided two types of comments: cogent rebuttal-type comments and insult-type comments. He allowed the insult-type comments, but refused to allow the comments that made good points. This speaks volumes about his motivations, does it not?\n\nHere's a basic response to his video:\nNotice his confusion with penalties and morals? He considers them separate, yet they are inextricable. A punishment that doesn't fit the crime is immoral, is it not? I'd dare say it is a crime in and of itself. Furthermore, I believe punishment is itself an immoral action that should be replaced with preventative measures, positive reinforcement, and correctional action when necessary, leading to behavioral modification. \"Punishment\", is either vengeance or negative reinforcement; while it can produce temporary, insincere change, it has largely failed to produce a sincere desire to be good. In other words, it's treating the symptom rather than the disease.\n\nWhat he suggests is that a penalty can change, while morality cannot. Is that fair? Of course penalties DO change, which he says is because of varying social factors - which INCLUDE changes in a society's moral compass, but he conveniently omitted that piece of information. He describes it as varying penalties for an objective moral. These were written LAWS with set punishments. There weren't amendments or exceptions. They didn't give permission to become lax. Yet, over time, as society changed, it became unacceptable (immoral) to impose certain punishments on people.

It often occurs as a result of daily activities and exercise. The heel bone (calcaneus) is the largest bone in the foot and the heel is the first part of the foot to contact the ground during walking. \n\n\nTwo structures located on the bottom (sole) of the foot are primarily associated with heel pain: the plantar fascia, a band of fibrous connective tissue, and the flexor digitorum brevis muscle, which supports the arch and flexes the four small toes. \n\n\nNormally, as the foot absorbs the weight of the body during walking, the arch begins to flatten and the plantar fascia and the flexor digitorum brevis muscle maintain the arch and stabilize the foot.\n\n\nGait abnormalities can cause inflammation of the structures attached to the heel bone, resulting in heel pain. Inflammation of the plantar fascia, called plantar fasciitis, is the most common cause of heel pain. \n\n\nPlantar fasciitis often causes pain that is more severe following a period of rest (e.g., after sleeping). This condition is also called post-static dyskinesia, which means \"pain after rest.\" \n\n\nSometimes, muscle strain and tension (usually on the flexor digitorum brevis) pulls a piece of bone away from the calcaneus, causing a heel or bone spur. Heel spurs can irritate nerves and cause pain. \n\nSigns and Symptoms \n\nHeel pain varies in severity. In most cases of plantar fasciitis, pain is more severe following periods of inactivity (e.g., in the morning), subsides with activity, and increases in severity with prolonged activity. This occurs because inactivity causes the muscles in the foot to tighten, increasing the strain on the plantar fascia and aggravating heel spurs, if they are present. The muscles stretch with mild activity and the heel pain subsides. Prolonged or strenuous activity increases inflammation and the severity of heel pain. \n\n\nOther symptoms of plantar fasciitis include swelling, redness, and heat. \n\nTreatment \n\nIf you should be bothered by any or all of the symptoms mentioned, the first step in treatment can be tried at home. Often, relief can be attained by: \n\n- Padding the heel with a soft, foam-rubber material \n- Wearing supportive shoes with a thick rubber heel \n- Placing ice against the bottom of the heel to reduce swelling \n- Stretching the calf muscles \n\nTreatment of the \"heel-spur syndrome\" -- or plantar fasciitis is two-fold. First, the inflammation responsible for the discomfort needs to be reduced, and secondly, the abnormal motion of the foot needs to be controlled. Reduction of the inflammation can sometimes be accomplished simply by reducing the amount of motion. This can be achieved temporarily with taping or strapping the feet. \n\n\nIf symptoms resolve fairly quickly, then many times no further treatment is needed unless there is another flare-up. Oral anti-inflammatory medications often are helpful in reducing this inflammation and occasionally an injection of local anesthesia and cortisone into the inflamed area is needed to calm it down. \n\n\nControlling the abnormal motion is the key to preventing reoccurrence of this syndrome, and the most effective means of doing this is with the use of a custom-fitted orthotic device. \n\n\nWhen the condition has existed so long that these methods of treatment fail to resolve the symptoms, surgical treatment is sometimes necessary to afford permanent relief.", "title": "Podiatrist in NJ - Heel Pain and Diabetic Foot Care", "publishedDate": "2009-04-17T01:17:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "44p0z-rXHOE", "description": "", "title": "Eight Silly Monkeys: Xhosa with English subtitles", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07T21:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "44p3V56CBoE", "description": "Using the Owl Tutoring spreadsheet to auto-solve exponential  distribution problems.

They oppose the pipeline claiming the pipeline will damage the environment and the delivery to the refineries will contribute to global pollution.  \n\nThis is a prime example that Democrats, animal right groups, environmentalist, and American liberals care nothing about animals or the environment.  Their main and sole concern is to cripple capitalism in the USA.  These groups / people believe the USA is a cancer upon the earth and must be driven to third-world poverty to save the earth.\n-\nThe Canadians are not stupid and will not let the oil stay in the ground.  China has offered to purchase it and if not sold to the USA, will be sold to China. \n\nThe oil if transported in that pipeline virtually no resulting pollution.  If that oil is loaded on takers to be transported across the width of the Pacific Ocean, those huge tankers cause enormous amounts of pollutants.  The refineries in Texas produce gasoline with minimal pollution as oppose to the polluting refineries in China.  The gasoline produced in the Texas refineries are put into USA vehicles laden with pollution control devices.  The gasoline sold in China enters vehicles known for the lack of pollution controls.\n\nBasically selling that oil to China will cause greater pollution upon this earth as oppose to selling it to the USA.  However none of this matters to American liberals, animal rights, environmentalist, and the Democrats.

R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker) is the ruthless head of Travi-Com, a telecommunications firm on the cusp of a major breakthrough in laser communications technology. However, Travis needs diamonds to finish the project, so he sends a group of men to Zaire, where he's told that a large supply of the gems can be easily found. When the men go missing, Travis sends his trusted assistant Karen Ross (Laura Linney), a one-time CIA associate, into the jungle to find both his staff and the jewels. Hoping to keep her mission a secret, Karen travels to Zaire in the company of Peter (Dylan Walsh), a researcher on primate development who is hoping to return Amy, a gorilla who has been taught sign language and can \"speak\" English with the help of a glove-controlled computer device. Also travelling with them is Herkermer (Tim Curry), a Romanian with a secret agenda: he's convinced that Amy can guide him to the Lost City of Zinj, where he believes that King Solomon's Mines are located. Upon arrival, the group is met by Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson), a self-described \"great white hunter who happens to be black,\" and they discover that the jungle holds a menace that they weren't counting on: a tribe of bloodthirsty gray gorillas.

In this video, Dr. Rosann Faull Au.D, owner of Audiology And Hearing Aid Services, addresses the question of price. She speaks frankly about the price of hearing aids and the fact that the cost of hearing aids has barely risen over the past decade while hearing aid technology has made enormous gains.\n\nAudiology and Hearing Aid Services\n12276 San Jose Boulevard #710\nJacksonville FL 32223\n(904) 685-1394\nhttp://drfaull.com/\n\nVideo Transcript for those with Hearing Loss:\nI'm Rosann Faull, Board Certified Doctor of Audiology. I'v been practicing audiology since 1979 and in Florida since 1983. \n\nOne of the most frequent questions I'm asked is \"Why do hearing aids cost so much?\" and I hope that when I'm finished you will agree with me that hearing aids are a bargain for what they provide.\n\nWhen we look at the cost of what we are paying today for the cost of bread, milk and gasoline, hearing aids comparatively have not gone up in price, but they have many technological advantages, that are significant, and not available 20 years ago - automatic volume control, automatic noise reduction, directional microphones to help you reduce sounds behind you.\n\nHearings aids were included in Popular Mechanics \"101 Innovations that Changed the World\". That's right - hearing aids. Hearing aids keep you connected to your family and your friends and keep you employed. \n\nThese marvels are small and fit discretely in or behind your ears. They are a bargain. They have not gone up in price compared to gasoline and yet they keep you connected and are a wonderful electronic, digital device. \n\nI'm Rosann Faull, Board Certified Doctor of Audiology, your community resource for better hearing in the Mandarin area of Jacksonville FL.

in fact, they're attracted \nAnd I'm so infatuated with her soul so attractive \nThe beauty of her fashion; now Cupid's my assassin \nImagination wanting more than a tease\nI'll compete until my essence be absorbing her steeze\nTake the keys from the jeans, as we thrust to the street\nGas touch floor, and the clutch will release\n\nNow I'm stuck to the seat, me and gravity hug tight \nI'm pushed back; like I wasn't holding the gun right\nA flood of insight, when the mood is completed \nThe windows fully rolled down, the moon roof receded\nFitted and adidas be caressed by the speakers\nThat's in through one ear, with blue-tooth- like features\n-And if the city is a forest then the buildings are the cedars \nExploring every corner before the coroner sees us\n-Lone orator finally found a companion \nManifested in the barren metropolitan canyon \nAnd the night light covers like a drape or a blanket\nIt ain't the same than what they got described in the pamphlet\nLife's a sound track, when this car goes faster-\n-Add a session with the city then the tracks are mastered\nLos Angeles attached to my heart, like a laniard\n-And when my car's in transit, these angels are the passengers\n\nManeuvering it faster, through the tunnels and land bridges\nEntranced by the lights, metaphysical back flipping\nThe mastiff of rap ish, a passion for hand-lin'\nCraft that enamors these chicks with attraction\nIt's infinity; the city completing the symphony \nProficiently; but with these lyrics are my affinity \nLove slice the air with precision through vicinities\nElegant and delicate agility and symmetry  \nAnd music is the session; with speech, we jam well\nWith enough soul to make a Jazz piece look stale\n-Let's ditch the safe side, tonight we take chance\nGetting lost in the bliss till buildings can breakdance\n\nSo set the tone baby, cause I want feel your breath alone \nAccording to my tempo, my heart beat's the metronome \nLet me take the lead, and you could follow full heartedly\nReciting you my song, while you're singing me the harmony \nIt's Romeo and Juliet; so hold me close and truly yet\nI'm lonely so I'm taking these emotions and I'm fooling it\nI pray you fall from a tall place, and fast too\nCause that's the only way I could run fast and catch you\nSo attached to... the woman standing in my mirror image \n-Imperfection's my only way of showing heroism \nIt's lyricism simply 'cause I ain't the best addressing ya\nPoetry, cause I ain't the best confessing love \nLonging for what's better, for my always and forever\nAnd I be first to admit; I'm a novice giving pleasure \n-And through the sickness of the Winter to the Summer's embrace\nI spill my heart for you at night and we can watch the sky illuminate\nIt's hard to estimate on what time we will get there\nCause bliss makes time feel suspended in mid air\nIf wish it'd be fair to wish that could be time altered\nI'll savor every moment till it turns to nostalgia.\nSo meet me at the altar, cause I'm waiting where the service is \nDespite the nervousness, you know my love for you is permanent\nI can't wait 'till we're alone... just your beauty with the sun and I\nI wrote for you a poem but the lyrics turned to butterflies\nYour lullaby the best at inspiring the inner child in me\nPreaching it so vibrantly; yet you're speaking so silently\nIt's sexy how you got me deciphering all the irony \nIf I could only carry our future inside this time machine\nI'm in love with these angels; if your streets could talk,\nImma hug em till I'm just another piece of chalk\nYour love's a firing squad, so baby fire at will.\nI pray that when I gaze into you, time would just stand still \n\nLyrics \u00a9 NAK Music", "title": "NAK x Ruff Trak \"City Love Song\" (Bakoda Remix) - [nakhiphop.com]", "publishedDate": "2011-03-11T19:24:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "45aM-v_wwE4", "description": "Ammeter  by  http://physicsgalaxy.com/home.html Watch thousands of videos and learn Physics in an easy manner! \nVisit http://www.physicsgalaxy.com to crack your exams and reach your coveted goal.\nCovering Physics for IIT JEE, NEET, AIIMS as well as school curriculum.\nNew videos are constantly being added...

How Fast is a thoroughbred race horse galloping? Clocked with HR/GPS onboard at 44mph for a few seconds. GoPro Hero 3 action camera/video camera. This is not California Chrome winner of Kentucky Derby 2014 and Preakness Stakes, but this is what it looks like from the jockey's point of view to \"work out\" a race horse at high speed.\nMake sure you click the link in the video to the heart rate monitor chart on this horse. You may find it very interesting. Many thoroughbreds can reach these burst of fast galloping speeds, but it does nothing more than give you an indication of the horse's max galloping speed. A horse will almost never win a race over a half mile if he reaches his absolute top speed in the race. A thoroughbred race horse galloping at a 44 mph pace will quickly tire and falter, allowing his rivals to pass him in the stretch. It really doesn't matter how fast your horse can gallop. It matters how fast your horse can run and how far he can maintain this fast galloping pace.\n\nGoPro Hero 3 Helmet Cam. Jockey cam shows what super fast galloping at 44 mph (workout ) looks like from rider POV. Please Subscribe, Like and Share.\n\nA champion race horse needs to have a large efficient heart and a high ration of fast twitch muscle fibers. Both these traits can be measured. The muscle tissue can be biopsied and the heart measured with an ultrasound machine. The heart can also be measured with a heart rate monitor which tells you how hard a horse is working at a specific speed or workload. The GoPro Hero 3 Jockey Cam and HR monitors make a great pair. If a horse can maintain a high cruising speed and continue work out near the aerobic threshold then he would be an exceptional animal. All this said, the horse will still need proper conditioning and be mentally sound to be considered a great thoroughbred race horse like California Chrome, 2014 winner, and other Kentucky Derby Winners.\nIf you have never had the opportunity and wondered what it would be like to open up on a thoroughbred race horse then maybe this helmet camera video will give you a little taste of the thrill.

De bakermat van knoflook ligt in Kazachstan, Oezbekistan en Kirgizi\u00eb. Daar komt de plant in het wild voor. De Zeeuwse kleigrond is geschikt voor knoflookteelt. De plant vergt wel veel van de bodem en daarom wordt een stuk grond maar eens in de zeven jaar voor knoflookteelt gebruikt. Zodra tweederde van de plant geel verkleurt kan de knoflook met loof en al  worden gerooid. Als het bolomwindsel mooi wit is en vliezig aanvoelt, moeten de bollen nog nadrogen. \nKnoflook wordt niet gezaaid maar vegetatief vermeerderd: de tenen worden uitgeplant. Elke teen wordt weer een nieuwe bol knoflook. Je kunt ze in het najaar planten, maar ook in het voorjaar.\npapaver somniferum slaapbol blauwmaanzaad breadseed poppy opium poppy\n\nPapaver is de bron van opium en de chemische afgeleiden daarvan; morfine en hero\u00efne. In Amerika en Europa zijn papaverzaden legaal, omdat ze geen van de alkalo\u00efden bevatten die wel aanwezig zijn in de volgroeide papaverplant, zoals morfine, code\u00efne, papaverine, en theba\u00efne. Deze variant van het papaverzaad, Lilac single, is hetzelfde als maanzaad, dat vanwege de uitgesproken smaak vooral gebruikt wordt om brood en taart mee te decoreren.\n\nPapaver somniferum, ofwel de opium poppy plant, kan ongeveer 1 meter hoog worden. \nDe plant groeide van oorsprong in Zuidoost-Europa en west-Azi\u00eb, maar heeft zich verder over deze continenten verspreid, alwaar hij nu in het wild groeit, vaak als onkruid. Vervolgens is de plant in het grootste deel van de rest van de wereld ge\u00efntroduceerd, inclusief Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. \nVroeger werden gedroogde opiumrestanten (van het gedroogd melksap) gebruikt om te roken, of soms ook om door voedsel te mengen. Deze waren echter niet geraffineerd, wat zo zijn problemen meebracht. \n\nPapaver somniferum is the type of poppy from which opium and many refined opiates, such as morphine, thebaine, codeine, papaverine, and noscapine are extracted. It is also called the \"sleep-bringing poppy\", referring to its narcotic properties.\nThe seed of the poppy, breadsead, is widely used in and on many food items such as bagels, bialys, muffins and cakes.\n\nMusic Publishing Rights & Public Performance Rights\nare licensed by Stock Shot Music (label of Fauna Film)\n\nfootage info: http://www.stockshot.nl/", "title": "knoflook & papaver - garlic & opium poppy", "publishedDate": "2009-11-27T12:56:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "45jZ5cEMv20", "description": "Golden Tilefish", "title": "OffShore Tile Fishing ~ Electric Reels", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T15:53:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "45k7lYi8BfA", "description": "outro hacker combat arms os hacker dominaram", "title": "combat arms quarentena hacker", "publishedDate": "2012-02-26T21:03:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "45k8WEDYQBE", "description": "more about kvass is here: http://www.playriga.com/index/latvian-food/kvass", "title": "Kvass", "publishedDate": "2011-08-11T15:58:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "45kWJyYuti4", "description": "Tiendas Dpaso te da #tips de #salud #nutrici\u00f3n #estilo de vida y mucho m\u00e1s. #meprovocadpaso.

Simply tell them you are not registered to vote and you do not plan to vote. \n\nI DO vote, as much as I can, but tell the callers you are not registered.

You can also call the campaign and ask to be removed, but that doesn't always work, because the campaigns don't often have a process set up to remove people from a list.\n\nCampaigns have many ways to get your phone number. Some even pay companies to provide them with call lists, and campaigns share those lists with other candidates.\n\nPoliticians use robocalls because they're cheap and they're easy.

In this video, I talk about how I originally thought melatonin was simply a placebo effect type product. But once I began taking 5mg of the supplement, I was able to fall asleep almost instantly.\n\nAfter doing more research, I learned that you really only need to take 1mg of melatonin for it to work completely.\n\nThis review will basically answer the question, \"does melatonin work?\" For more information about Melatonin, you can always head over to my blog: \n\nhttp://www.dostrong.com/blog/personal-ramblings/melatonin-for-sleep-review-does-it-work/\n\nIn the article there is a poll.

Misto, Dr., musictherapyst\nPadova/ITALY\nAbstract: Rhythm-phonetic system Takadimi A set of techniques, of South Indian origin, with\nspecific musical, music therapeutic, logopedic, psychomotor and pedagogical values. It's especially\nappropriate to facilitate and improve the faculties of attention, concentration, assimilation, storage and\nrepetition: in this sense is aimed at fundamental aspects of the so-called \"operational intelligence\".\nDescription: From the practical point of view, Takadimi consists in articulating particular phonemes\n(which have the ability to loosen up and strengthen the muscles used in speech), accompanied by\nclapping and swaying motion of the whole body. It is very useful in working with hyper-active subjects,\nwith little ability to remain on task for significant time. Improves the acquisition and practice of\nmathematical calculation, facilitates the strengthening of brain neuronal synapses favoring the\nconnections between the two hemispheres. Generally improves mood and self-esteem and it's a\nvaluable aid in school learning in general. Including a graduated scale of difficulty levels, has the great\nadvantage of being applied to a wide range of users: from the pre-school children, students at various\nlevels, to the holders of psychophysical deficit, the elderly people and so on. At a recreational level, in\naddition to ensuring a moment of leisure and entertainment, facilitates empathic exchange inducing\nsocialization and opening channels to communicate through non-verbal. We start with a basic rhythm\nrather slow and then double it faster and faster: the conductor must master the articulation of\nphonemes and the different movements and clapping of hands and fingers, starting from very simple\nexercises and then developing a wide range of rhythmic structures which, including many odd\nformations, allows the improvement of psychomotor coordination, developing mental agility and\nemotional discharge. The cultural origin of the system (konakol) has its roots in Carnatic music of\nSouth India, and for thousands of years has been used in the Indian sub-continent both in strictly\nmusical education (rhythmic solfeggio) that for therapeutic purposes. Even in modern European music\ntoday you can hear hints and references to this system of phonemes, which facilitates its use in a\nmusic therapeutic key everywhere, overcoming cultural differences.", "title": "TELL ME TAKADIMI! - Riccardo Misto", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T23:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "462Oh1Y4Ltg", "description": "Male male in versione inedita cantata da gigi d'alessio", "title": "Male male(pero sto male)-Gigi d'Alessio", "publishedDate": "2007-12-14T15:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "462xM29q9Qc", "description": "opening 16 de one piece", "title": "hands up one piece (live) Kota Shinzato", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T05:09:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "463JmnC0rrw", "description": "Video Cam Direct Upload", "title": "Re: Human Rights = Fair apportionment of power", "publishedDate": "2008-09-15T10:26:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "463lAODIYzQ", "description": "Hey!

They thought it should be conserved for tourism and recreation. Therefore, they presented document to the Royal Forest Department in order to set a national park. On the 10th October 1986 ( B.E. 2529 ) this area was declared as Pa Hin Ngam Forest Park, with the area of 10km2.\nIn 1993 ( B.E. 2536 ), the Royal Forest Department surveyed the area near by and found that 80km2 of surrounding forest is still fertilizing. Therefore, due to its fertile forest and fascinating features, this Forest Park was designated a national park on the 19th September 1994 ( B.E. 2537 ). The area consists of mountain range which has mountains, such as Pung Haui Mountain, about 200-800 meters above sea level. In geology class, the area divides into Phupan Rock, Prawihan Rock and Phu Kradaung Rock which are the rock, about 180 - 230 million years ago, of Jurassic and Triassic era. Also, the area is the source of water of She River's area and Sonthi River which empty into Parsak River.\n\nClimate Flora and Fauna\nThe forest is semi-evergreen forest mixed with deciduous forest.

Wikipedia says:\n\"On 19 March 2011, Knut collapsed in his enclosure at the Berlin Zoo and died. Witnesses reported that the after the bear's left leg began shaking, he walked around in circles before falling into the water. The cause of death has yet to be determined.[...]\"\nAn autopsy was performed on the body on mondays. The current results after 22. of march tell from water in the lungs. Drowning was the actual cause of death. The fall into the water seems to be the result of a seizure caused by Encephalitis. I am currently watching Wikipedia for further notes.\n\nAdditional:\nOne of the main reasons for those people to say that Knut should not have been kept alive is, that such an animal tends to become mentaly sick when handraised by humans and that they later won't be able to put him to other polar bears to live and mate there. Mental sickness also was pretty much the reason why last year they shot the wild bear \"Bruno\".\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_JJ1\nThe public was angry and sad about this action.

That spasm of precautionary destruction, at his home in Romania\u2019s Transylvania region, did not help him much \u2014 especially as he left pieces of what would later become evidence scattered in the mud.\n\nTwo weeks later, on Jan. 22, a global hunt for the celebrated and mysterious hacker who first revealed self-portraits painted by George W. Bush and plundered a trove of personal emails from politicians, military officers and celebrities finally ended in an early morning raid of his home.\n\n\u201cI was expecting them, but the shock was still very big for me,\u201d the hacker, now serving a seven-year sentence, said.

He figured that would hide any fingerprints leading back to Romania, where he already had a police record. That followed a 2011 conviction for hacking into the email accounts of Romanian starlets and other celebrities under the name Micul Fum, or Little Smoke. Mr. Lazar denied any interest in celebrities, asserting that he had only stumbled on most of the people he hacked as Guccifer, a long list that included the actress Mariel Hemingway, the \u201cSex and the City\u201d author Candace Bushnell, the editor Tina Brown, the comedian Steve Martin, the author Kitty Kelley and many others. \n\nDarrin McBreen talks with Hollywood producer Nathan Folks about his films to expose the three big false flags in the United States.

The way he makes that level of contrast between the found sounds and the synthesized tones work is what first caught our ear through his own Sound Healers compilations and his remixes for people like Crewdson, but with his Hollowed EP the Leeds based beatsmith explores that tonal juxtaposition even further across seven original tracks.\n\"A large part of the EP is made up of recordings I have made along with sounds I have synthesized or vocals sent from friends,\" he offers of his processes. \"It's a way I've been trying to work more and more. It's basically a collection of tracks which represented the styles I was messing with at that time.\"\nA hip hop producer at heart, Bambooman's experiments tend to temper the slower tempos, revelling in that slower pace. But whether he's simply decorating the lurch and snap of tracks like 'Stacks' or 'Skip' with airy pads so that his enveloping basslines pull the focus or toying with the voices of his synths on beats like 'Frosted' or 'Hollowed', he manages to make his output sit comfortably with the low end addled zeitgeist.\n\nReviews for This Release:\n\n\"Loving all I'm hearing from Bambooman\" - Gilles Peterson (BBC 6 Music)\n\n\"The boy done good\" - Jehst\n\n\"Man's a don!\" - Jon K (Hoya:Hoya)\n\n\"This is brilliant!\" - Spam Chop (Wigflex)", "title": "01 Bambooman - Frosted [Sonic Router Records]", "publishedDate": "2013-04-29T00:00:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "46P4HbhTvtQ", "description": "Dr. Choi's WordBank\n\nMastering English Vocabularies \nthrough Elaboration Method: \nOne Word at a Time! \n\n\uc601\uc5b4\uc640 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0\ub85c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \n\ubc18\ubcf5\ud559\uc2b5 \uc601\uc5b4 \ub2e8\uc5b4\uacf5\ubd80. \n\ud55c \ubc88\uc5d0 \ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc529!\n\nCheers!\nOM~", "title": "Dr. Choi's WordBank [skinflint]", "publishedDate": "2011-12-17T01:14:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "46P4hnJPfH8", "description": "How to Read Thermal and Inversion in a Meteorology: Skew-T Graphic\n\nwww.facebook.com/BasatOkay\nwww.albatros.org.tr", "title": "METEOROLOGY : Skew-T graphic, Thermal and Inversion", "publishedDate": "2014-07-19T09:02:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "46PJmw0me8o", "description": "Just a top tip from www.total-hockey.com on how to fit your gum shield.", "title": "Top Tip - Gum Shields", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T13:52:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "46PK9UY3hcs", "description": "A look at the Typhus for my first commission\n\ncheck out Broken Toad Pigments \nhttp://www.artisan-quarters.com/index.php", "title": "First Commission Typhus", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T08:59:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "46PU8Wd_VBM", "description": "Woodpeckers new Shelf Pin Jig is a multi-featured tool that allows woodworkers to create accurately spaced and cleanly bored parallel rows of shelf pin holes.

However, a legend handed down from generation to generation reveals that the place is formerly inhabited by the natives known as Subanen who dwelt among rivers and lakes, they called the swift river current as \"MALAGOS TUBIG\", later on, upon the arrival of Spanish colonizer sometimes in the early part of the century, the term MALAGOS TUBIG was change to MARGOSATUBIG.\n\nThe municipality of Margosatubig is considered the oldest province of Zamboanga del Sur , it came into existence in the latter part of the Spanish regime and because of its strategical location, the Spanish colonizers found the place good and safe to live in, they built a Stone Fort, a few meters away from the present Municipal hall, now the site of Pax High School as their bastion against the Moro pirates and bandits who used to plunder the coastal inhabitants of the nearby places of the Baganian Peninsula and the Moro Gulf.\n\nThis Stone Fort provided the Spaniards wide commanding view of the surrounding areas and a large portion of the Dumanquillas Bay. The bay in turn provided them a safe and good harbor.\n\nThe town became a MUNICIPAL DISTRICT of the old province of Zamboanga del Sur in the part of 20th century with Mr. Francisco Paragas as the first appointed Municipal District President. Later on, the Municipal District of Margosatubig was made into a regular municipality during the Commomwealth Government by virtue of Executive Order No.77 dated December 23, 1936 issued by President Manuel L. Quezon composing of eight(8) barrios, namely: Poblacion, Maculay, Kabatan, Lapuyan, Malangas, Naganaga, and Talusan with Mr. Crispin Atilano as its first elected Municipal Mayor.\n\nMargosatubig, one of the original four(4) towns of the old province, became one of the eleven(11) original regular municipalities of Zamboanga del Sur when the old province of Zamboanga was divided into two(2) separate and district province upon the enactment of Republic Act 711 dated June 6, 1952 authored by Congressman Roseller T.

Pairs of shoals and reefs were compared, where one shoal was zoned 'green' (closed to fishing) and the other 'blue' or 'yellow' (open to line fishing). The demersal habitats and vertebrate communities were sampled using non-extractive Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). These BRUVS revealed a diverse fauna of fish, sharks, rays and sea snakes, including species prized by fishers, taken as bycatch, or not vulnerable to hook and line fishing.\n\nAt each shoal multiple BRUVS (typically 12) were deployed, each recording 1 hour of underwater video. These videos were then viewed by an expert classifier and the relative abundance and species of fish and other vertebrates (such as seasnakes, turtles, whales and dolphins) seen in each video were measured and recorded. \n\nThe videos shown in this series (162 videos from all 1102 BRUVS) were selected to show the best 30 secs of the best 3 videos (based on the abundance of coral trout and red emperor) from each of the 48 study locations. \n\nThis video was taken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). http://www.aims.gov.au\n \nZone: GREEN (closed to fishing)\nLocation: Barcoo Bank\nCamera depth: 26 m,\nDate taken: 05/11/09 11:39,\nBRUVSID: 7459\nOpcode: ARP4BB\nCamera: 53", "title": "Great Barrier Reef fish survey 7459, Green zone, Barcoo Bank", "publishedDate": "2010-12-10T02:42:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "46XoD6RjkjY", "description": "No. Not the hamburgers!

Taking technology from each of the previous Compost Wizard compost tumblers, the Dueling Tumbler is feature packed and an incredibly powerful gardening tool.  The twin chamber design allows you to compost two batches simultaneously; No more waiting for one batch to finish before adding your kitchen and yard waste you've been stockpiling.  50 gallons (7 cubic feet) of capacity provides enough space for most suburban gardeners.  The rich, black, polyethylene construction keeps the tumbler hot so composting is extremely fast and best of all, the plastic is completely recycled.  The base is hollow and catches liquid compost run-off for later use as nutrient-rich, compost tea.  The unit comes pre-assembled so the only setup involved is taking the composter out of the box and putting it where you want it.

An extensive archive created on behalf of the oil giant, the Library includes the only surviving moving pictures of important motorsport events. For Rallying in the 1960s we have chosen two evocative programmes which capture the spirit and atmosphere of the special stages of the decade.\n\nLap of the Gods This is an action-packed record of the 1966 Acropolis Rally, considered the roughest and toughest European motoring event. For two days and two nights, more than 100 crews fight a gruelling battle against heat, appalling roads and continuous eye-stinging, throat-choking dust. We follow the full story to its controversial conclusion, enjoying the sights and sounds of classic cars from Mini, Saab, Sunbeam, Volvo, Ford and more being pushed to the limit by legends including Roger Clark, Paddy Hopkirk, Timo Makinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Gunnar Andersson. Maxwell Boyd narrates as we enjoy the action, including in-car footage, and interviews with the stars.\n\nWorks Entry Narrow mountain roads are the setting for this film, following the progress of the 1963 Alpine Rally. Passing through the towns, villages and picturesque countryside of the Maritime Alps, this was an arduous, car-breaking event, and a rally which provided plenty of entertaining footage for the enthusiast. From watching the crews gather for the start in Marseille, we relive the whole adventure -- including the challenging road and weather conditions! There's a wonderful collection of cars, including Mini Cooper, Reliant Sabre, Hillman Imp, Saab 96 and Austin Healey 3000. Among the stars are Erik Carlsson, Rauno Aaltonen, Vic Elford, Timo Makinen and the Morley brothers, Donald and Erle, heroically chasing a Alpine Gold Cup hat trick.\n\n\"Another gem from the BP Video archive. Two 30 minute programmes covering each rally, with the first part especially sporting footage of on-the-limit Cortinas, Minis and Saabs. A charming reminder of competition in a bygone era, from the very unscientific team discussion on food and drink (\"I thought sausages and cold drinks chaps, and perhaps a cup of tea if it's a cold night\") down to the Russian entry with Communist red numbers on the door\" TrackDriver\n\n\"If you want to see Big Healey works rally cars in action, then you'll find them in the second of the two rallies featured on this DVD: the 1966 Acropolis and the 1963 Alpine. Many of rallying's greatest names (and cars) appear in these films from the Castrol archive, which are shot in colour with Ipcress File-style backing music and the clipped narration of Maxwell Boyd and Raymond Baxter respectively. Mk 1 Cortinas and Mini-Coopers get a lot of screen time, with some truly heroic driving from the likes of Clark, Hopkirk, Aaltonen, Makinen and many more. Gripping from start to finish\" Octane\n\n\"Two utter gems from the treasure trove that is the BP Video Library. The 1963 Alpine and '66 Acropolis Rally films feature colour footage of the superstars of the day: Erik Carlsson, Timo Makinen, Rauno aaltonen and Paddy Hopkirk, with plenty of onboard material and rare interviews\" Autosport\n\n\"This DVD comprises two 30-minute films from the BP archive, with classic footage from the 1963 alpine Rally and 1966 Greek Rally. Both have great on-board action and interviews with the drivers - impressive considering this was 50 years ago. Watching rally pros like Timo Makinen and Paddy Hopkirk negotiate traffic out of Athens only to get stuck at toll roads is hilarious.

The rawness of his music and the lyrical content of his songs have caused discomfort in some circles, taken the Mozambican and Portuguese speaking blogging community by storm worldwide, and saw him apparently fall victim to alleged attempts at silencing his voice. \n\nHis first album, \"Babalaze\" (Hangover), was released in 2007 making him a very controversial artist due to some of his lyrics. His song 'As Mentiras da Verdade' (The lies of the truth) talked about the murder of journalist Carlos Cardoso, the subsequent trial and questioned the truth presented by those  that rule and wrote Mozambican history. His \u2018Povo no Poder\u2019 (People in Power) was considered a panegyric on the 5th of February Maputo Riots. He was called in for questioning at the Attorney's Office on 30 April 2008 on grounds of inciting the violence due to his lyrical content. One of his songs included a call for the country's president, Armando Guebuza, and contained also what could easily be understood as a threat. Rolling Stone called him a \"hero of the people\" and he is respected in his country by people of all ages. He is censored, boycotted and his songs do not play on public television or radio.\n\nBorn in Namaacha, close to the Swaziland border, son of a farmer and a saleswoman, in his teens he was introduced to the protest poetry of Jos\u00e9 Craveirinha, a Mozambican writer in the colonial period, and started writing. When he turned 10, he moved to the capital, Maputo, and at 16, discovered hip-hop and decided that this was what he wanted to do.  His second album, \u201cCubaliwa\u201d (Rebirth), was released in 2013, has been critically acclaimed and has sold over 3000 copies in a country where artists barely sell 1000 copies. It includes the hit singles \"ABC do Preconceito\" (The ABC of Prejudice) and \"Homem Bomba\" (Human Bomb).\n\nIn June 2014, Azagaia suffered two consecutive epileptic convulsions which led him to pursue medical exams. The doctors discovered a brain tumor on the left temporal lobe, about the size of a golf ball. After getting opinions from four different doctors (in Mozambique and South Africa), they recommended surgery to remove the tumor. He was given two years to live if the tumor is not removed as future convulsions may result in a paralysis of his body. Due to the urgency, the doctors recommended Azagaia be operated in India because of their high success rates and their fast internment policy. \n\nUnfortunately, the cost for the surgery is very high and we can't raise on our own. We are here asking for the necessary funds to cover the surgery, the travel expenses for two medical attendants, as well as funds for pre-op and post-op treatment, which can take up to 6 months.", "title": "Save the life of renown Mozambican hip-hop artist and social campaigner Azagaia - Edson da Luz", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T19:03:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "474E3JVJvcI", "description": "It's Mom's birthday today.

Interior Ministry\nThai protesters besiege more government ministries\nProtesters Raid Compound of Thai Finance Ministry\nYingluck Pressured as Thailand Ministries Seized\nThailand PM invokes security law amid protests\nThai political protests paralyse more ministries\n\n\nNearly 1,000 flag-waving anti-government protesters massed in front of Thailand's Interior Ministry on Tuesday, intensifying pressure on Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra a day after storming compounds of two government ministries.\nProtest leaders said the demonstrations would spread, raising the risk of violence after a tough security law was imposed across Bangkok late on Monday to control tens of thousands of protesters rallying against Yingluck and her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\nThaksin, a former telecommunications tycoon, was ousted in a 2006 military coup but has hovered ghost-like over Thai politics since fleeing the country in 2008, accused of undermining the country's powerful monarchy, breaching conflict-of-interest laws and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison.\nHe remains a populist hero among the rural masses but is reviled by much of the traditional Bangkok elite of top generals, royal advisers, middle-class bureaucrats and business leaders - a group that backs the opposition Democrat Party.\nAfter forcing their way inside the Finance Ministry on Monday and bursting through the gates of the Foreign Ministry compound, the Democrat-led protesters marched on Tuesday to the agriculture, tourism, transport and interior ministries.\n\"Our important mission today is to surround the four important ministries of the government,\" Watchara Ritthakanee, a protest leader, told a cheering, whistle-blowing crowd.\nThe government shut and evacuated staff from the agriculture, tourism, transport ministries which are now guarded by protesters to stop people entering. About 800 protesters surrounded the Interior Ministry, warning staff to leave or they would storm the building, witnesses said.\nA 15-minute standoff ensued as thousands of protesters tried to march to Government House, the prime minister's offices, which was heavily barricaded by police. They retreated to Bangkok's historic quarter, an area popular with tourists where they have set up a main stage.\nYingluck and her ruling Pheu Thai Party began a two-day confidence debate in parliament where they hold a commanding majority after the opposition accused them of graft and trying to pass laws to white-wash Thaksin of corruption allegations.\nAt the Finance Ministry, more than 1,000 protesters filled a courtyard, waving Thai flags and chanting \"Get out! Get out!\" against the government. Many had stayed overnight, sleeping on plastic mats.\n\n\nStreet Tensions Intensify in Thailand\nThai protesters call for nationwide uprising\nAnti-government protests erupt in Thailand\nThailand: Long shadow of the 'Thaksin regime' prompts new protests and ...\nThai protesters besiege 4 more ministerial buildings seeking govt ouster\nThai foreign ministry occupied\nProtesters attempt to paralyse ministries\nThailand protests: Demonstrators target government buildings\nThousands at anti-government protests in Bangkok\nThai political protests paralyse more ministries\nThai Opposition Protesters Continue Occupying State Buildings\nThailand protests: More ministries surrounded\nThai protesters call for nationwide uprising\nUS urges calm amid Thailand protests\nThailand protests: PM Yingluck invokes security powers\nThai protesters occupy Finance Ministry in bid to oust government\nThai anti-government protesters occupy finance ministry\nThailand government under pressure as thousands march in protest\nThai anti-government protesters stage major rally\n\nRed Shirt Movement, Thai Protests Anniversary, Thailand Red Shirts, Thailand, Thai Red Shirts, Thailand Prime Minister, Red-Shirts, Thailand Protest Anniversary, Thailand Protests, Thailand Crackdown, Thai Protests, Thaialand Red Shirt Protests, World News\n\nSouth Asia, Thaksin-Shinawatra, Prime Minister Thaksin, Thailand, Thailand Protest Damage, Thailand Prime Minister, Thailand Protests, Asia, Thaksin, Thaksin Passport, World News\n\nRiot policemen,Thai anti-government,protesters,Thai protesters,Thailand protests,Thai opposition,Anti-government protesters,Yingluck Shinawatra,Thailand PM invokes security law amid protests,Protests in Thailand,Yingluck,Thai political protests,Thailand,Protesters attempt to paralyse ministries,Thousands at anti-government protests in Bangkok,Thailand Ministries Seized,Thailand Violence, Thailand Demonstrations,Thailand Prime Minister,Thailand Protests, Bangkok Protests, Thailand Emergency Law, World News", "title": "Thousands Protest OutSide Thai Governing Party's Headquarters And Army HQ In Bangkok", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T07:04:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "47D-2NhNgLo", "description": "Play GIG-IT catches up with The Kid Daytona to talk about his new project \"Savoir Faire\" and Social Media.  \nTW: @TheKidDaytona\n\nwww.facebook.com/playgigit \n@Playgigit", "title": "Play GIG-IT Presents: Well Versed Wednesdays - The Kid Daytona", "publishedDate": "2013-10-24T17:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "47E-JXfUFg8", "description": "Historic preservationist and avid volunteer Jim Whiting teaches us how to properly trim boxwood.

Imagine, God listens to all who believe in Him. He hears our every word, and in His own time, responds. \"You\" and \"me\", God listens to us. He yearns to have our voice reaching out to Him.\n\nThe Pattern of Powerful Prayer\n\nRead | Colossians 1:9-10\n\nPraying effectively isn't something we naturally know how to do\u2014for most Christians, it must be learned. In fact, one of the disciples who walked with Jesus asked for help in this area (Luke 11:1).\n\nSo often we hear requests to bless, protect, and provide for a person. While these are fine to ask of the Lord, there is another, more powerful way to pray: When we use Scripture to speak to the heavenly Father, our conversation contains His own divine authority.\n\nThe apostle Paul is the author of today\u2019s passage. It shows us the specific requests he brought before God concerning the Colossian church. These apply to us today as well. Let\u2019s focus on the first two requests today, and we\u2019ll look at the remaining four over the weekend.\n\nPaul prayed that the Christians at Colossae would . . .\n\n\u2022 Understand God\u2019s plan for their lives. While the Lord often does not reveal everything at once, He will give seeking hearts enough information to trust and follow His way.\n\n\u2022 Conduct themselves in a manner worthy of Christ and pleasing to Him. Paul longed to see the Colossians\u2019 lives prove consistent with their true spiritual identity: A follower of Jesus is evident to other people because of lifestyle and spiritual fruit (Gal. 5:22-23). One of the greatest gifts we can give is to lift a person in prayer. And there is no more powerful way to do this than to speak Scripture on his or her behalf. Colossians 1:9-14 is a beautiful example of a passage to pray as we bring loved ones and ourselves before God\u2019s throne.", "title": "The Pattern of Powerful Prayer", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T00:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "47GHbc-08I8", "description": "DAGUERRE.\n\"CARMEN\"\nAlbum Mandragore", "title": "DAGUERRE Carmen", "publishedDate": "2013-01-30T18:31:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "47GMTqUfaaQ", "description": "\uc815\ub9d0\ub85c \uac1c\uca4c\ub294 \uace1\uc774\ub2e4 \uc774\uac70 \uc2dc\ubc1c.....", "title": "[BMS] wigen - Stellaria Media 5K Another NOOBPLAY", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T13:35:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "47GRrONivUc", "description": "University of Chicago economist Don L.

fight SPAS - The battle in the city , in dense urban areas .\n  With the participation of the local population ( the rebellion , revolution , civil war) often occurs with the use of available tools ,

A street fight is characterized by three-dimensionality of the operational situation (at the multi-storey building ) , limited visibility territory battle , quick change of scene , a high density of shelters ready for firing points greater capacity for surprise hidden troop movements . A street fight is considered to be the most complex kind of combined arms combat , far superior to the complexity of the fight in the forest and mountains. Terms of street fighting dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of guerrilla and irregular military forces relatively regular troops over to fight in the open .

The discoverer of the piece, Ludwig Nohl, affirmed that the original autographed manuscript was dated 27 April. This manuscript has been lost.\n\nIt is not certain who \"Elise\" was. Max Unger suggested that Ludwig Nohl may have transcribed the title incorrectly and the original work may have been named \"F\u00fcr Therese\", a reference to Therese Malfatti von Rohrenbach zu Dezza (1792--1851). She was a friend and student of Beethoven's to whom he proposed in 1810, though she turned him down to marry the Austrian nobleman and state official Wilhelm von Dro\u00dfdik in 1816. According to a recent study by Klaus Martin Kopitz, there is flimsy evidence that the piece was written for the German soprano singer Elisabeth R\u00f6ckel (1793--1883), later the wife of Johann Nepomuk Hummel. \"Elise\", as she was called by a parish priest (she always called herself \"Betty\"), had been a friend of Beethoven's since 1808. In the meantime it has been proven that Rudolf Schachner, who in 1851 inherited Therese von Dro\u00dfdik's musical scores, was a relative of Babette Bredl who in 1865 let Nohl copy the autograph in her possession. Thus Kopitz's hypothesis is definitely refuted.\n\nThe pianist and musicologist Luca Chiantore argued in his doctoral thesis and his recent book \"Beethoven al piano\" that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today. Chiantore suggested that the original signed manuscript, upon which Ludwig Nohl claimed to base his transcription, may never have existed. On the other hand, the musicologist Barry Cooper stated, in a 1984 essay in the Musical Times, that one of two surviving sketches closely resembles the published version. It has also been suggested that Elise simply refers to a term at this point in history which simply meant 'sweetheart', therefore suggesting this piece was written for Elise (Theresa Malfatti)", "title": "F\u00fcr Elise on glass harp", "publishedDate": "2010-12-27T15:06:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "47UBCu5pf8k", "description": "Marcel Kittel gewinnt die \"Goldene Henne 2014\" in der Kategorie \"Aufsteiger des Jahres\".
