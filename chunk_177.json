It has a generally flattened body shape, a protective carapace, and flipper-like arms, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. E. imbricata is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving beak with prominent tomium, and the saw-like appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water temperature.

The surface is extremely hard and easy to care for.\n\nThe problem with laminate flooring is the composition of the fiberboard under the surface. Fiberboard will absorb water to cause swelling and warping. You do not want to use a wet mop to saturate a laminate floor with water. Water also leaves spots on laminate.\n\nFor day to day maintenance, you can keep your laminate looking great by sweeping or using a vacuum. If you use a vacuum, just use a soft brush head. A beater brush can scratch the surface. Next, use a microfiber mop to remove all light particles and debris. Microfiber will also wipe up water spots.\n\nTo clean a laminate floor, use a laminate cleaner rather than water. Using a microfiber mop, spray the head with the cleaner and mop your floor to remove dirt and stains.\n\nFor heavy stains, spray the stain with the cleaner and wait 5 minutes, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.\n\nYou can make your own cleaner by mixing 1 part vinegar and 3 parts warm water in a spray bottle. Vinegar will remove almost every type of dirt and grime that ends up on your floor and it doesn't leave streaks or water spots.\n\nNever clean your laminate with abrasives, scouring powder or abrasive pads. Never use a polish, varnish or wax.\n\nWipe up spills immediately. Protect your laminate from grit and particles, especially at an entry way.

Co. has transformed itself from a small bib overall company to the largest workwear manufacturer in the world. Sold in every state in the U.S., Dickies now offers a broad spectrum of work garments ranging from work pants and work shirts to denim jeans and women's workwear. Since its beginnings in 1922, every piece of Dickies workwear has stood for the quality, toughness, and pride that embodies the spirit of the American worker.\n\nC.N. Williamson and E.E. \"Colonel\" Dickie began their business careers in the \"vehicle and harness\" business in Bryan, Texas. In 1918, they made what turned out to be a momentous decision when they and a few friends established the U.S. Overall Company. Then, in 1922, C. Don Williamson joined with his father and cousin to buy 100% of the overall company on a one-third-each basis and renamed it Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company.\n\n\nFrom its early years, Williamson-Dickie enjoyed steady growth, slowed only by the Great Depression, and during World War II, the company was sequestered to produce millions of uniforms for the nation's armed forces. In converting to civilian production after the war, C. Don Williamson began a strategy of geographical expansion and established new production facilities, warehouses, and sales territories throughout the United States. In the late 1950's, Williamson-Dickie became an international company by expanding into the European market and the Middle Eastern market - where Texas oilmen introduced the Dickies brand to Middle Eastern oil fields.\n\nWhile Williamson-Dickie began as a bib overall company, today it has grown to be the number one manufacturer of work apparel worldwide. By continually expanding and updating its selection, Williamson-Dickie now offers garments ranging from its staple work pants and work shirts to items such as women's workwear, chore coats, and denim jeans. Dickies\u00ae workwear is currently sold in all 50 states and throughout the world in countries such as South Africa, Australia, Russia, Chile, Japan, Iceland, Canada, Europe and Mexico.", "title": "Dickies Canada - Quality Workwear Since 1922", "publishedDate": "2011-03-06T06:12:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AA6c3vvTS2Q", "description": "On Monday 23rd June -- Sunday 29th June, 9pm -- 10.30pm Current TV launch the Wasted season, a frank expos\u00e9 exploring the way drugs and alcohol are used and abused by young people today.

There is a full moon out that is marking the end of the Chinese New Year. During this festival, people often go into the street to play with lanterns, find a lover, have family gatherings, eat tangyuan, and other fun activities.\n\nCharacters:\n- Hok Sieu-Yuk (\u970d\u5c0f\u7389): A prosperous girl, dressed in pink, holding a rounded flat fan.\n- Hwan Xa (\u6d63\u6c99): A servant girl to Sieu-Yuk, dressed in blue, holding a lantern to light the path for Sieu-Yuk.\n\nNote:\n- I wanted to translate this for the longest time because it is one of my favorite operas. The difficult part of translating this scene is interpreting the poetic Classical Chinese language. In other words, a few words can paint a picture with a thousand meaning. So, the translations may not be close to experts, but I tried my best. If there are any constructive criticism, let me know in the comment box below.\n- \"The galloping horse lantern...\" is a lantern that allows a small picture to revolve inside due to the rising hot air of the candle flame. Also, Hwan Xa and Sieu-Yuk are describing the different lanterns in the area.\n- \"Others would not dream for that\" can be also interpreted as \"The person that strangely knows my (hidden) desires is not, in fact, a dream.\"\n- \"My highly-degreed gentleman is like a (high flying) cloud. Where could he be at?\" can be also thought as \"Many highly-degreed gentlemen are like many clouds in the sky. Yet, where can I find the gentleman that I desire?\"\n- \"Admiring that hanging lantern is like a butterfly loving a flower\" can also mean \"I am admiring that hanging lantern, like a butterfly clinging onto its flower.\"\n- The actresses' outfits are dressed as if they were already married. In the story, both are suppose to be dressed as little girls with less jewelry, hair, and elaborate clothes. However, it is fathomable that they wanted to impress the beauty of Chinese opera to their Beijing(?) audiences. In my opinion, it is a really beautiful piece of artwork!", "title": "\u7d2b\u91f5\u8a18\u9078\u6bb5 (\u5ee3\u6771\u7cb5\u5287) / The Legend of the Purple Hairpin (Cantonese Opera Excerpt)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T12:26:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "AA__L7lpBfI", "description": "http://www.Cap-d-Agde.com  or  http://www.naturist.de/56/\n\nLuxury naturist vacation house in Cap d'Agde.\n\nThis is a villa within the garden of the Port Nature.

It is part of a campaign to promote tourism in Yamagata, a farming area known for rice, beef, cherries and pears.\nThe inland city of Fukushima is more than 60 kilometres northwest of the tsunami-crippled nuclear power plant on the Pacific coast.\n\nTAGS\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "Japan to offer bullet train with footbath!", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T18:40:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AAopq_UnO2E", "description": "A loudspeaker that takes its performance cues from JBL's own legendary M2 Master Reference Monitor.

The abortifacient medications used are RU 486 (Mifepristone, Mifeprex, Mifegyne) and Misoprostol (Cytotec) that are normally used in the first trimester of pregnancy from 3 to 10 weeks gestation. We have been using the Abortion Pill to perform abortions from 3 to 24 weeks for over 25 years. \n\nMisoprostol was first used in countries such as Brazil in the late 80's where abortions are illegal to terminate pregnancies in the first and second trimester of pregnancy. The Misoprostol tablets were purchased at pharmacies without a prescription being required. Due to millions of women terminating their pregnancies in Brazil, Misoprostol is no longer available. This has caused many women to go back to old self inducing methods which include the use of coat hangers, knitting needles, cut glass, carved sticks, turpentine, coca cola, bleaches, poisons, and other caustic liquids used to attempt to abort their pregnancies. This leads to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. \n\nExtensive research on thousands of women has been done worldwide that shows the combination of the abortifacients RU 486 and Misoprostol are highly effective in terminating pregnancies at 20 weeks in 24 hours or less over 99.9 percent of the time. The process is safe and efficient. RU 486 works at 20 weeks by increasing the intrauterine pressure and increases the endogenous prostaglandins and the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin. When it binds to the uterine receptors on the pregnant uterus and causes uterine contractions which expel the fetus and pregnancy tissue. \n\nFor women who have an Abortion at 20 weeks pregnant the Abortion Pill can be used to start and complete the process in 24 hours or less in 99% of cases.

The To-199 Neophron jet is based off the \"Yak-130\", which exists in real-life. An attack aircraft, its primary purpose is to provide Close Air Support (CAS) for ground forces, although it can also play an anti-air role. \n\nI take this jet for a flight in the skies over Altis, engaging two M5 Sandstorm MLRS (artillery) units, and a squad of riflemen. This aircraft, just like the A-164 Wipeout, is heavily armed, so even when all the targets are down, I unleash the remaining weapon types.

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nMax: http://www.youtube.com/user/gassymexican\nMark: Mark: http://www.youtube.com/user/allshamnowow\nChilled: http://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage", "title": "LATIN FIRE!

First of all you should regularly top up your reservoir  with fresh plain water and adjust the pH. \n\nThis is because you will lose water to evaporation and plant transpiration but the strength of the solution does not necessarily drop along with the level of the water. So, in some cases as the reservoir water level drops the solution concentration actually goes up or gets stronger. \n\nSo, add only fresh water and then adjust your pH accordingly. Try and keep a record of how much water you are putting in the reservoir to top it off and once the amount of water added equals half of the reservoir capacity it's time to change the solution and rinse the reservoir. \n\nFor example if you have a 20 gallon reservoir and over the course of 12 days you have added 10 gallons of water, then it is time to change your solution.\n\nVisit Steve's Hydroponics at http:www.steveshydroponics.ca\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ABExF0CJcHU", "title": "How often to change nutrient solution? | Hydroponics Halifax", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T14:40:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABF5EnJ1zH4", "description": "This is a brief piece with 2-D cut-outs and 3-D models rendered together.

Many people forget that horses arent machines and that they are actually incredible animals who offer us so much. Some people need to view their horses as companions. Less and less people are listening to their horses these days and i just wanted some people to start seeing horses in a different light.

This is the boss I get to fight after going through the 12 secret rounds of the game, but it really is the same as the one you'd fight after Round 99 if you hadn't collected the crystal. The only difference is that you get a bad end for that, while going through the 12 secrets rounds grants you access to the happy end assuming you also are in 2 player mode (if you look closely, you'll notice the second player appearing at the last instant before the happy end starts. To make the second player appear if you're in single player mode, just press start and then select if you have at least one free life.) Just like the game says during the ending credits, the adventure is not over since they give you the BBAJI password which activates a mode called Super Bubble Bobble. You need to go through all the same rounds including the 12 secret rounds, but some things have changed like some enemies have been swapped with other enemies. You need to get the happy end in Super Bubble Bobble mode to really finish this adventure. The requirements are the same, get the crystal on Round 99, go through the door at the middle that then appears, make your way through the 12 secret rounds, fight the boss which is the same, but needs to be hit 80 times instead of the 60 hits on regular Bubble Bobble mode. You also need to end the game in 2 player mode and then you get the ultimate true ending. Video games simply showed no mercy back then!

Make it easy when you choose the right icing tip. Find everything you need to complement your delicious delicacies at Michaels: http://www.michaels.com/cake-decorating/bags-and-tips/809188220\n\n(0:21) The round tip is the simplest icing tip. It comes in a variety of sizes and can be used to create a many different patterns. To create a simple dot, hold your icing bag straight up and apply a steady amount of pressure while squeezing out your icing. When your dot has been fully piped you can stop applying pressure and pull up and to the side in a quick motion. Swirling slightly will help eliminate any tip.\n\n(0:28) Creating stars with the star tip uses the same principles as the round tip. Just make sure to quickly pull straight up when you have a complete star so you can avoid any jagged edges.\n\n(0:37) With the petal tip you can create an elegant ruffle to edge a cake or top a cupcake. Hold your icing bag at a 45 degree angle with the wide end of the tip touching your dessert and the narrow end facing towards you. Move your wrist in a short, wavy pattern to create an eye-catching ruffle.\n\n(0:43) Leaf tips are flat like a petal tip but have a small notch in the center. This gives the leaf tip a vein in the center to look like... a leaf! To create a simple leaf, hold your icing bag at a 45 degree angle and prepare to pull it in any direction you would like the tip to face. Squeeze harder at the beginning to form the base of the leaf then lessen pressure as you pull to the side and up. \n\n(0:49) Drop flowers are created in the same way you pipe a round tip or star tip design. Simply hold the bag vertically and pull up and away quickly after completing your flower.\n\n(0:59) With the basket weave tip, you can create complex weave designs that will really wow a crowd. Start by creating a vertical stripe from top to bottom. Place short horizontal stripes evenly down the vertical strip making sure to leave a tip's worth of empty space between them. Squeeze another vertical stripe at the end of your row of horizontal stripes. In the empty spaces, create a series of horizontal stripes by first burying your tip under a vertical stripe, then spanning over another before ending it at a third vertical stripe. Repeat as necessary. \n\n(1:14) A multi-opening tip is best used for flower centers, fur, or grass designs. There are a variety of ways to pipe the multi-opening tip, depending on the look you are going for. Treat it like a round tip for short dots or pull it at an angle to create long hair and fur.", "title": "Bakeware Basics: Icing Tips", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T21:07:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABVvq6i8MF4", "description": "Learn how to be proactive in your pest control.

Haptics is commonly referred to as the ability to interact with a virtual environment through physical contact, such as receiving sensations associated with what is going on in the virtual world through touch. There are two types of feedback. Tactile and kinesthetic. The first major breakthrough in Haptics technology came in 1993 when MIT's AI laboratory created a device that made it possible for a person to feel a virtual object.\n \nSince then Haptics technology has been making their appearance in everyday products such as smart phones that vibrate when touched. Haptic devices are even being merged with other fields of immersive technology. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have managed to combine Haptics with augmented reality with the creation of a hologram that can be paired with a tactile feedback system to give the user a physical feeling of the holographic object What's more amazing is that it requires no special equipment, just your bare hands.

Winters Company offers plumbing, heating, cooling. If you need service today; we're the business to call. My website is wintershomeservices.com. I'll be talking to you today about plumbing. \n\nAlright, so today we are gonna talk about how to clear a bathroom sink drain. So, we have our basic bathroom sink drain here. 9 times out of 10, usually the sink is blocked right here at this pop up assembly. This collects a lot of hair, it collects a lot of toothpaste, a lot of soap, so we have to disconnect it and then lift -- lift the assembly straight up and lo and behold, you can see that it's clogged full of what looks like mud and sludge and all that stuff. \nNow, if you have an old tooth brush, you take and scrub it out and knock these things out. But for this demo, I'm gonna just take some water and I'm gonna run it through and get all these little ports clean and clear. See, how they're getting more clear now. You want to still keep doing that. Done. The sink, it's still jammed, so now what are we gonna do? Now we've to take a plunger and see what we can -- see how we can fix it. You have a plunger like this, you have it in, there's two different settings for it. This setting would be for getting a seal off flat surface, like in a sink. This would be a seal for a toilet, when it goes into the bowl. So in this case when we go in to clean our sink, we're gonna push this in. \n\nOn every sink there's an overflow and it's located usually in the front. Take your plunger, you're gonna block of with a clean rag, block off this little overflow port and hold your hand firmly down in that port, you wanna push down with the plunger and then pull back, push down, pull back. Sometimes you wanna put more water in it and use the water to push the blockage. And there it goes. It's not fun but it's gonna get done by itself, so, very disgusting.\"", "title": "How to Fix a Clogged Sink | Plumbing Repairs", "publishedDate": "2011-06-07T16:46:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABgkp96mgag", "description": "SARAGOSA 26.06.1982 SP Sestic pada u sesnaestercu..penal..Petrovic daje gol..", "title": "JUGOSLAVIJA-HONDURAS 1-0 1982", "publishedDate": "2011-03-11T17:46:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABgy04lvoRQ", "description": "Information about the reptile Champsosaurus", "title": "Champsosaurus", "publishedDate": "2012-08-06T06:07:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABh2-Z5h4ks", "description": "Ngu\u1ed3n: Nh\u00e0 h\u00e1t Tu\u1ed3ng VN", "title": "L\u1edbp tu\u1ed3ng \"H\u1ed3 Nguy\u1ec7t C\u00f4 h\u00f3a c\u00e1o\" - V\u1edf \"H\u1ed3 Nguy\u1ec7t C\u00f4'\" (tr\u00edch gi\u1edbi thi\u1ec7u)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-21T05:53:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABh8CLDikW4", "description": "[Trailer] PUNICA 4D REALITY MEETING II [Prince Art] \u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e30\u0e08\u0e4a\u0e30", "title": "[Trailer] PUNICA 4D REALITY MEETING II [Prince Art]", "publishedDate": "2012-03-25T05:19:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABhDiXbUaBE", "description": "Download 'Break The Rules' (UK/IRE) from http://smarturl.it/BreakTheRules\n\nNew album SUCKER available Dec 16 (US) and Jan 26 (UK & Europe).

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest surviving terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.

Targeting the bright rimmed bedrock knobs, the image also captures the interaction of two distinct types of windblown sediments. Surrounding the bedrock knobs is a network of pale reddish ridges with a complex interlinked morphology. These pale ridges resemble the simpler \"transverse aeolian ridges\" (called TARs) that are common in the equatorial regions of Mars.\n\nThe TARs are still poorly understood, and are variously ascribed to dunes produced by reversing winds, coarse grained ripples, or indurated dust deposits. HiRISE observations of TARs have so far shown that these bedforms are stable over time, suggesting either that they form slowly over much longer time scales than the duration of MRO's mission, or that they formed in the past during periods of very different atmospheric conditions than the present.\n\nDark sand dunes (http://www.uahirise.org/images/2013/details/cut/ESP_033262_1725.jpg) comprise the second type of windblown sediment visible in this image. The dark sand dune seen just below the center of the cutout displays features that are common to active sand dunes observed by HiRISE elsewhere on Mars, including sets of small ripples crisscrossing the top of the dune. In many cases, it is the motion of these smaller ripples that drives the advance of Martian sand dunes. The dark dunes are made up of grains composed of iron-rich minerals derived from volcanic rocks on Mars, unlike the pale quartz-rich dunes typical of Earth.\n\nThis image clearly shows the dark sand situated on top of the pale TAR network, indicating that the sand dunes are younger than the TARs. Moreover, the fresh appearance of the sand dunes suggest that they are currently active, and may help shape the unusual TAR morphology by sandblasting the TARs in the present day environment.\n\nWritten by: Paul Geissler (audio by Tre Gibbs)   (18 September 2013)\n\nCredit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona\n\nHiRISE High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment: \n\"Explore Mars, one giant image at a time.\"\n\nhttp://www.uahirise.org/\n\nScience Theme: Geologic Contacts/Stratigraphy\n\nThe arrangement of different kinds of layered rocks is a powerful tools used by geologists to determine relative ages and processes that emplaced the rocks. How the rocks are positioned relative to each other is called stratigraphy. When rocks are horizontally layered, then the law of superposition states that for any given rock layer, rocks below it are older and those above are younger. This is because rocks are laid down as a sequence with the oldest rocks deposited initially, followed by younger rocks deposited above. If processes like mountain building, faulting, or erosion later disrupts the rocks, then this relative age determination may no longer be used. The geologic contacts between the rocks will show which one of these processes has disrupted the horizontal sequence and can be used by geologists to piece together what was the original stratigraphy. \n\nFurther Reading of this Science Theme:\nhttp://www.uahirise.org/science_themes/geologic.php\n\nView Images in this Theme: \nhttp://www.uahirise.org/science_themes/geologic_contacts_1.php", "title": "Mars Science: Two Generations of Windblown Sediments [HD]", "publishedDate": "2013-09-19T01:21:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABl6DVONZ2A", "description": "O foda da fossa \u00e9 a falta de foda.\n\nINSCREVA-SE: http://goo.gl/1ABgya\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/entrebrisas\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/entrebrisas\nSite: www.entrebrisas.com.br\n\n\n2014 \u00a9 Entre Brisas Todos os direitos reservados.", "title": "FOSSA", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T02:53:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "ABl70J9niXk", "description": "Matt Garrett|WP Traffic Tagger Reviews & Bonus\nClick here if you're looking To Make Money Online - http://toptierbusiness.org/go/instant-payday-network/\n\nFull WP Traffic Tagger Reviews & Bonus :http://toptierbusiness.org/make-money-online-internet-marketing/matt-garrettwp-traffic-tagger-reviews/\n\nWP Traffic Tagger by Matt Garrett.

This video doesn't just apply to AR500 Armor Body Armor, and can also be applied to other hard body armor such as ceramic, and SAPI style plates.\n\nIt's important to remember that with body armor we're attempting to prevent an immediate incapacitating blow by protecting your vitals. The definition of vitals can be open to interpretation. With our body armor, we aim for the balance between maximum protection of your vitals (vitals that will immediately incapacitate the operator if struck) vs. mobility. With the 10\" x 12\" armor plate which was used in this demonstration, protecting your entire torso isn't realistic, or the goal we are trying to achieve. Maximum protection while maintaining agility is the formula.\n\nThe 10\" x 12\" AR500 Armor Level III Chest Plate featured in this video is available for only $65.00 | http://www.ar500armor.com/ar500-armor-body-armor/chest-armor.html\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube for more test videos! \n\nVisit our Website | http://www.AR500Armor.com\nLike us on Facebook | http://www.Facebook.com/AR500Armor\nFollow us on Twitter | http://www.Twitter.com/AR500Armor\n\nMusic from https://Machinimasound.com\nLicensed under Creative Commons CC-BY 3.0 Unported License\nhttps://machinimasound.com/license", "title": "How to wear hard Body Armor - AR500 Armor", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T00:51:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC7813m-fYE", "description": "Abu Hamza, the radical cleric who became the face of violent extremism in Britain, can be extradited to the US to face terrorism charges, the European court of human rights has ruled.\n\nThe court in Strasbourg said the human rights of Hamza and four other men held in Britain -- Babar Ahmad, Syed Talha Ahsan, Adel Abdel Bary and Khaled al-Fawwaz -- would not be violated if sent to the US to stand trial. European judges decided they needed more information about the mental health of Haroon Aswat, an aide to Hamza, before reaching a decision on him.\n\nThe ruling clears the last realistic obstacle to Hamza's extradition.\n\nThe men have the right to appeal to the grand chamber of the European court and have three months to make an application.\n\nBabar Ahmad's sister said they would appeal the ruling. An appeal has only a slim chance of success, but it could delay extradition for months.\n\nNazia Ahmad, 27, told the Guardian: \"I think we will be taking that avenue.\" She said the family, from Tooting, south London, would fight on. \"We're very disappointed, we're going to carry on fighting for Babar,\" she said.\n\nAhmad said her brother should be prosecuted in the UK, and claimed the Crown Prosecution Service had not considered significant parts of the evidence against him, when it decided he should not face charges in Britain.\n\nShe said: \"His case should have been dealt with by the authorities in the UK. They gathered the evidence, they gave it to the US, and they should have looked at it and decided if he should be put on trial in the UK.\"\n\nAhmad said her brother's case represented a \"serious abuse of process\". She called for a public inquiry and for ministers to answer her famiy's questions.\n\n\nDavid Cameron welcomed the court's ruling. Speaking during a trade mission to south-east Asia, he said: \"I am very pleased with the news. It is quite right that we have proper legal processes, although sometimes one can get frustrated with how long they take.\"\n\nThe home secretary, Theresa May, said the government \"will work to ensure that the suspects are handed over to the US authorities as quickly as possible\".\n\nHamza, who controlled the Finsbury Park mosque in north London and turned it into a factory for violent jihad, was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in Britain after being convicted in 2006 of inciting hatred.\n\nThe previous government had wanted him sent to the US before his jail term had been completed, but the extradition was halted after his lawyers went to the European court.\n\nThe European court of human rights halted extradition proceedings in July 2010, arguing it needed more time to consider complaints that transferring Hamza and others wanted in the US risked breaching their rights by exposing them to possible life imprisonment without parole and solitary confinement.\n\nAhmad, who the US claims ran a website allegedly raising funds for Islamic extremists, is a computer expert from south London. He has been on remand and refused bail since his arrest in August 2004 on a US extradition warrant.\n\nHe was awarded \u00a360,000 in compensation because of the violence British police used during his arrest in December 2003, during which he was punched, kicked and throttled. His case has been supported by the former transport minister Sadiq Khan, who is a family friend and Labour frontbencher.\n\nIn the Hamza case, the US has had to given written assurances that it will not impose the death penalty or place the suspects before Guant\u00e1namo Bay-style military tribunals.\n\nThe US alleges Hamza was in contact with Taliban and al-Qaida terrorists and aided the taking of 16 western tourists as hostages in Yemen in December 1998, an incident that ended in the deaths of three Britons. He is also charged with attempting to set up a training camp for \"violent jihad\" in Oregon in 1999, along with Aswat.\n\nThe court in Strasbourg had considered the cases of the four men for over four years.\n\nIn a press release, the court said: \"The European court of human rights held, unanimously, that there would be: no violation of article three (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) of the European convention on human rights as a result of conditions of detention at ADX Florence (a \"supermax\" prison in the US) -- if Mr Ahmad, Mr Ahsan, Mr Abu Hamza, Mr Bary and Mr Al-Fawwaz were extradited to the USA; and, no violation of article three of the convention as a result of the length of their possible sentences if Mr Ahmad, Mr Ahsan, Abu Hamza, Mr Bary and Mr Al-Fawwaz were extradited.\"\n\nThe court said it wanted more information on Aswat before reaching a judgment: \"The court adjourned its examination of Mr Aswat's application as it required further submissions from the parties, on the relevance of his schizophrenia and detention at Broadmoor hospital to his complaint concerning detention at ADX.\"", "title": "10 Apr 2012- European Court Allows UK To Deport Islamic Hate Preachers", "publishedDate": "2012-04-10T19:40:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC784SvSsV0", "description": "swedish and german intro soon.", "title": "Orson & Olivia - English Intro", "publishedDate": "2008-02-29T04:52:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC7CRqcWKUM", "description": "http://www.surgicalhospital.com Do you have knee pain?

Richmann tried to actually \"weigh\" electric force.This was a good idea which led to the invention of absolute electrometer.Electrometer is a device for measuring difference of potentials. It was used for studying atmospheric electricity. The device consisted of a metal rod. A linen thread of certain length and weight was suspended on top of the rod. When the rod was electrified the thread would deflect. Deflection angle of the thread was measured with the help of a degree scale attached to the rod.Richmann was relentlessly working on his device. He enhanced it by combining it with Leyden jar. The electrometer's design was later updated multiple times. In the end it looked as we know it today.So to measure difference of potentials between conductors one conductor is connected to the rod while the other one is connected to the electrometer case. A rigid metal case of the device is an important part of it as it distinguishes electrometer from electroscope.Back then people said that electrometer could measure \"electric force\".But nobody knew yet what \"electric force\" was. That means nobody knew what kind of physical quantity the device measured. It turned out that by using electrometer one could learn about both charge and difference of potentials.So after gauging the device in volts or coulombs one can take corresponding measurements.", "title": "Richmann's electrometer", "publishedDate": "2011-05-06T23:21:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC7dR1yu1cE", "description": "Visit Us\n\nhttps://www.bharatswabhimantrust.org; \nBLOG: https://www.swami-ramdev.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bharatswabhimanrtrust; https://www.facebook.com/swami.ramdev\nhttps://www.bharatswabhimantrust.org; www.facebook.com/pages/Poojya-Acharya-Bal-Krishan-Ji- Maharaj/192639277447326?fref=ts\n\nGoogle +\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/b/116234359494767803939/116234359494767803939/posts\n\nFollow us on Twitter \nClick:https://twitter.com/bst_official\nClick:https://twitter.com/yogrishiramdev", "title": "Ayurvedic use  Purpel Tephrosia  (Sharpunkha)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T12:17:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC7udLh-240", "description": "", "title": "Houyhnhnm 07/22/09", "publishedDate": "2009-07-24T05:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC8MIb8o4vE", "description": "This was taken with a 4 inch refractor telescope.We took this video using no lenses and no filters and this is not stacked in registax or any other software!!!!!!!!\nPls comment below on how to get rid of the purple haze;can you just use a hydrogen alpha filter or an ultra-vilot filter!", "title": "Saturn through a 4 inch refracting telescope(using a web cam and not stacked and no filters)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-08T09:28:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC8On3Oov40", "description": "als Erinnerung an den Schund namens Fast Food!\n\nGuten Appetit!", "title": "MC Dreck - Video von Aktion Umwelt", "publishedDate": "2009-10-04T22:10:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "AC8j3qSI93w", "description": "TRESemm\u00e9 Style Setters and Teen Vogue go On-Campus to create some fresh back to campus looks.

Poon and Alan Stecker). You can read more about the Centenarian Study on our website ( http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron/research/centenarian_study.html ).\n\nA keystone research project at the Institute of Gerontology ( http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron/ ) is the Georgia Centenarian Study (1988 to 2008) of longevity and survival of the oldest old, led by the Institute Director Emeritus, Leonard W. Poon, and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Aging. An unprecedented number of elders in the coming decades will face the risks of disease, frailty, and dependence. The population at the highest risk is the oldest of the old who are increasing at the fastest rate among those who are 65 years and older.\n\nCentenarians by definition are survivors who have lived to at least 100, which is more than 20 years longer than the average life expectancy. A fundamental challenge is to understand how centenarians live longer and what specific biological, psychological, and sociological characteristics they possess that would allow them to survive longer. Another basic challenge is whether we could generalize the knowledge gained in our volumes of aging research to individuals of average life expectancy, which is in their 70s (e.g., the MacArthur Study), to individuals who live 20 to 30 years longer. \n\nAt the extreme longevity of the human species, centenarians represent the ultimate range of independence and dependence, frailty and strength. There is much to be learned from centenarians about survival, disease, frailty, and independence, for all who hope to maintain health and a successful quality of life in older adulthood. The Georgia Centenarian Study is broken into 3 phases: Phase 1 (1988-1992), Phase 2 (1992-1998) and Phase 3 (2001-2009).\n\nSelect Articles About This Study\n\nSydney Morning Herald (2010): http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/mastering-the-art-of-100-years-of-fortitude-20101110-17nmt.html\nUGA Research Magazine (2009): http://researchmagazine.uga.edu/aa/spring2009/aging-gracefully.php\nSharp Brains (2009): http://www.sharpbrains.com/blog/2009/11/07/100-is-the-new-65-living-longer-and-better/\n\nOur Important Links\n\nInstitute of Gerontology at the University of Georgia: http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/geron\nGeorgia Geriatric Education Center (Resources and training about best practices in the aging field): http://training.geron.uga.edu\nList of aging resources: http://training.geron.uga.edu/other_resources\nUGA Gerontology YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/ugagerontology\nUGA Gerontology Vimeo Channel: http://vimeo.com/channels/ugagerontology\nElder Cohousing & Other Intentional Communities: http://www.geron.uga.edu/eic/elderintentionalcommunities.html", "title": "Georgia Centenarian Study (Pt. 9): Engaged Lifestyle & Quality of Life", "publishedDate": "2010-11-11T21:02:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACE_2bu1Hr8", "description": "Hoy os traigo una sencilla f\u00f3rmula para haceros un aceite casero para u\u00f1as y cut\u00edculas.\n\nNecesitamos:\n-Aceite de almendras.\n-Aceite de rosa mosqueta.\n-Un frasquito de cristal.\n-Opcional: unas gotas de aceite de ricino.\n\n\u00bfPara qu\u00e9 sirve este aceite?

We have more than 1700 of the roughly 26,000 species in the Orchidaceae family known globally yet, regrettably, 25 per cent of orchid extinctions occur here.\n\nIn part our species are vulnerable because they require symbiotic relationships with specific types of 'mycorrhizal' fungi to grow and germinate, and many are pollinated by a unique species of pollinator. Unravelling one thread in these complex relationships can have disastrous consequences.\n\nThere are many ways in which Australian orchids are pollinated, but the majority require a third-party pollinator to transfer pollen from one plant to another. Some provide a pollen or nectar food reward; others simply mimic food-rewarding plants but provide no treat.\n\nOne of the more interesting pollination syndromes in Australia is sexual deception. Male thynnine wasps are drawn in by pheromones, and then copulate with the flowers, thinking they are female wasps. This transmits pollen between plants.

Termites are considered the top threat to wood-based structures, ahead of fire, flood and wind. Although many people believe that termites are only active in the spring, termites are actually active throughout the year.\n\nDrywood Termite Treatment Cost\n\nIt can be difficult to detect a drywood termite infestation because these insects live entirely within the wood on which they feed. Once they have taken up residence in your walls or a piece of furniture, there may be very few visible drywood termite signs. In fact, it can take up to five to seven years for a drywood termite colony to create noticeable damage.\n\nDrywood Termite Treatment Cost\n\nTermites prefer to be in dark, humid environments, so they do not typically feed on the surface of wood, where they would be visible to the human eye.

Fenugreek is certainly something I've been trying to incorporate more into my family's diet based on all this amazing new data. It's strong stuff though!

Enterococcus is an anaerobic bacterial genus that is a commensal inhabitant of the human intestine. Because of their intrinsic drug resistance, Enterococci are an important pathogen in the hospital environment and are a major cause of nosocomial (health care--associated) infections. Although colonization with resistant strains is the norm, physically debilitated patients can develop endocarditis, surgical wound, urinary tract or bloodstream infections.\n\nThe series depicts the evolution of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) rates for inpatient samples, combining the rates for E. faecalis and E. faecium. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic, one of few that inhibits the growth of enterococci, which is why CDC guidelines recommend for its \"prudent use.\" Before the development of newer antibiotics (linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline), treatment alternatives for VRE infections were severely limited.\n\nThe maps show considerable regional variation.  Vancomycin-resistance generally increases over time, with highest rates generally in the northeastern are of the country, but by 2008--09, increasing resistance rates begin to spread south and west.  Throughout the decade areas of the country experience resistance rates greater than 35%.\n\nThe National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) also reports Enterococcus resistance rates around 25% at the beginning of the decade, following a steep rise in the 1990s. The 2003 NNIS survey reports increasing resistance (29%), which is even higher in the 2006--2007 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) data summary (33%). The rise of VRE rates is disconcerting because the bug can share its resistance genes with S. aureus, giving rise to vancomycin resistance in that organism (a new superbug known as VRSA). In addition, with the emergence of linezolid resistance to VRE, future treatment alternatives are becoming fewer and more expensive. \n\nThe national average resistance level for the sample was 26%, rising from 24.1% in 2000 to 26.4% in 2009.\n\nThe sample consists of 257,579 inpatient isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium tested for vancomycin resistance.

Also the main vocal 'Sung Min Ki' has a voice that goes up to three octaves, and also 'm-nine's great rap and Bokiri's unique voice makes a perfect song. \n\n\n2013\u5e741\u67081st\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u300c\u304d\u308c\u3044\u300d\u3067\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3057\u305f3\u4eba\u7d44\u7537\u6027\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7'\u30a8\u30a2\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\uff08\u30a8\u30e0\u30ca\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30df\u30f3\u30ae\u3001\u30dc\u30fb\u30ae\u30ea\uff09'\u304c\u3053\u306e\u590f\u6dbc\u3057\u304f2nd\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0[\u96fb\u8a71\u306b\u51fa\u3066]\u3092\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3059\u308b\u3002\n\n[\u96fb\u8a71\u306b\u51fa\u3066]\u306f\u3001\u4e00\u5ea6\u30b1\u30f3\u30ab\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u305f\u604b\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306a\u3089\u5171\u611f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u8a71\u3092\u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u5bcc\u3093\u3060\u6b4c\u8a5e\u3067\u63cf\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u7a4f\u3084\u304b\u3067\u660e\u308b\u3044\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u304c\u52a0\u308f\u308a\u3001\u3044\u3064\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3082\u697d\u306b\u805e\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u66f2\u3060\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u3053\u306e\u66f2\u306f\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ab\u30eb'\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30df\u30f3\u30ae'\u306e3\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u3092\u884c\u304d\u6765\u3059\u308b\u9ad8\u97f3\u3001'\u30a8\u30e0\u30ca\u30a4\u30f3'\u306e\u8efd\u5feb\u306a\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066'\u30dc\uff65\u30ae\u30ea'\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u8abf\u548c\u3092\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n\n\u25b6 LOENMUSIC FB : http://www.facebook.com/LOENMUSIC.official\n\u25b6 LOENMUSIC TW : https://twitter.com/LOEN_MUSIC\n\n2013\ub144 1\uc6d4 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2f1\uae00 \uc568\ubc94 \"\uc608\uc058\ub2e4\"\ub85c \ub370\ubdd4\ud55c 3\uc778\uc870 \ub0a8\uc131 \uadf8\ub8f9 \"\uc5d0\uc5b4\ud50c\ub808\uc778(\uc5e0\ub098\uc778, \uc131\ubbfc\uae30, \ubcf4\uae30\ub9ac)\" \uc774 \ub354\uc6b4 \uc5ec\ub984 \uc2dc\uc6d0\ud558\uac8c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2f1\uae00 \uc568\ubc94 [\uc804\ud654 \uc880 \ubc1b\uc5b4]\ub97c \ubc1c\ub9e4 \ud55c\ub2e4.\n\n[\uc804\ud654 \uc880 \ubc1b\uc5b4]\ub294 \ud55c\ubc88\ucbe4 \ub2e4\ud248\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uc778\ub4e4\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \uacf5\uac10 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \uc7ac\uce58\uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc0ac\ub85c \ud480\uc5b4 \uae30\ud0c0 \uc5f0\uc8fc\uc758 \uc794\uc794\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubc1d\uc740 \ubd84\uc704\uae30\uac00 \ub354\ud574\uc838 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc5b4\ub514\uc11c\ub4e0 \ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ub4e4\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace1\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \uace1\uc740 \uba54\uc778\ubcf4\uceec \"\uc131\ubbfc\uae30\"\uc758 3\uc625\ud0c0\ube0c\ub97c \ub118\ub098\ub4dc\ub294 \uace0\uc74c\uc774 \ub3cb\ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \"\uc5e0\ub098\uc778\"\uc758 \uacbd\ucf8c\ud55c \ub7a9\uacfc \"\ubcf4\uae30\ub9ac\"\uc758 \uc720\ub2c8\ud06c\ud55c \ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4\uac00 \uc5b4\uc6b0\ub7ec\uc838 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc870\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "title": "[MV] Air Plane(\uc5d0\uc5b4\ud50c\ub808\uc778) _ Give me a chance(\uc804\ud654 \uc880 \ubc1b\uc5b4)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T03:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACc3VUOk1VM", "description": "Bibit Durian Bawor, Bibit Durian Bhineka Bawor, Bibit Durian Terbaik, Bibit Durian Bawor Banyumas, Bibit durian yang cepat berbuah, bibit durian bawor kemranjen, bibit durian unggul yang cepat berbuah, bibit durian bawor jogja, bibit durian bawor surabaya, bibit durian bawor di semarang.", "title": "Bp.H.Tovix 0813 2711 9234, Durian Bawor, Durian Bhineka Bawor, Budidaya Durian Bawor", "publishedDate": "2013-11-29T01:50:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACcss6mKi2s", "description": "tugas media pembelajaran \nade nuraini\n4915110494\np.ips 2011 A\nUNJ", "title": "media pembelajaran ips 2011 proses masuknya hindu budha", "publishedDate": "2013-12-22T07:01:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACdLA5FKID0", "description": "", "title": "force shielder", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T06:44:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACdT99zO6fE", "description": "Bio Span is the first supplement specifically designed to increase your life span with a unique combination of the miracle molecule Resveratrol, potent antioxidants and longevity gene activators.

A Thermo electric generator is normally made from two different sheets of plates of semi conducting material such as e.g. semi conducting metal. The sheets are electrical separated, but thermal connected at two end points. However, the construction and use of thermo electric generators is also a well-known technical field. \nThermo electric generators hold great promise for widespread use due to their solid state structure, silent operation, high reliability and long service life. Thermo electric generators used for power generation can produce electricity from virtually any source of heat, which could enable many energy conversion processes to increase efficiency, reduce pollutant emissions and lower costs. Thermo electric generators used for heating or cooling can achieve very sensitive temperature control, and thermo electric generators used for cooling do not require volatile working fluids. \nRadiation from the sun is the primary source for energy on Earth, however, depending on the location the energy contained in the radiation from the sun will vary. On the northern or southern hemisphere the effect from the sun may be between 600 and 1000 watt per square meter, closer to equator, e.g. in Sahara the effect may be as high as between 1200 and 1300 watt per square meter. Although, use of radiation from sun too power thermo electric device have been attempted, these attempts have not been very successful as the efficiency of the thermo electric generators was to low to provide any effect that was of economical and industrial feasibility. Examples of the prior use of sunlight to power thermo electric generators are e.g. disclosed in US patent document 20080142069. \nThe European patent application EP 2124267 discloses a thermoelectric generator for implants and embedded devices. This thermo electric generator is capable of producing electric power to an electric device. The thermo electric generator comprise a first unit that is adapted for being embedded or implanted into a body and a second unit that is adapted for being arranged at the outer surface of the body. When the first and second units are thermally connected to each the thermo electric generator converts heat (the temperature difference between the first unit and the second unit) directly into electrical power. \nThis thermo electric generator is, however, not suitable for power production in the scale required in a house hold. Moreover this thermo electric generator is adapted to produce electric energy on the basis of a rather low temperature difference and thus this thermo electric generator is not suitable for being used in a power generator formed as a solar panel. \nThus, it has hitherto not been interesting to use thermo electric generators for power production in a scale that is of commercial interest as the efficiency has been to low in relation to the required investments. A major problem associated with the prior art solar panels is that the either are optimized for producing hot water or to produce electric power. In solar panels suitable for photovoltaic power generation the energy from the sun is converted into electric power by using the photovoltaic effect. In such solar panels the solar cells will only produce power when the sun is shining. In hot water solar panels no electric power is produced. Accordingly, there is need for a solar panel that is capable of producing both hot water and electric power. \nIn application in which thermo electric generators are used to transform heat available on a large surface it is practice to provide the surface with a large number of thermo electric generators in order to archive a large surface power density. Since the surface has a limited capacity to receive heat/energy (e.g. from the sun). The thermo electric generators can not be fully utilised and thus the power generated per generator is reduced. \nIt is an object of the present invention is to provide a power generator with thermo electric generators that has a higher efficiency. \nIt is also an object of the present invention to provide a power generator suitable of being used as a solar panel that has a high efficiency and is cost effective. \nSee more at:\nhttp://tonchev.net \nhttp://starton.biz \nhttp://b2b.bg \nhttp://tonchev.org \nhttp://greenclips.eu\nhttp://eldrive.eu", "title": "THERMOELECTRIC Direct \"heat to power\" is  producing from virtually any source of heat", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T07:40:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACg41RGhLf0", "description": "Learn how to say MyocardialInfarction,Prophylaxis correctly with our pronounciation tutorials", "title": "How to pronounce MyocardialInfarction,Prophylaxis", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T00:26:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACgF6dD-T-I", "description": "Donations Accepted: http://bit.ly/1bnLbdq\nIf I have saved you a call to Apple Support, please consider a small donation.\n\nAbout to update your iphone / ipad / ipod and don't want to lose any data?\nhttp://www.errorchannel.net/How-to-backup-iphone-ipod-ipad-in-itunes.aspx\n\nThis article explains how to backup your iphone, ipad, ipod data using iTunes.

A few sequences are a combination of real footage and animation, shot with the canon 5D HD 1080. Whilst the picture sequences have been shot in double frames, the real footages has been converted a lower framer rate, approximately 10 frames per second.\n\nThe character is made of a wooden skeleton with all usual humans' joints. This allowed to move the character accurate and in a realistic manner. The head, face and hands were merely crafted with Newplast clay.\n\n \n\nHomunculus / Homunculi\nA Homunculus is a term used in different fields of study to indicate a human being. It merely accrues in the study of alchemy and preformation, psychology and science. It also has become a concept of miniature, since homunculus represents a little version of a human. Homunculus has its roots in Latin and stays for \"little man\"(Latin Homo = Human). A homunculus proportions are different to a human being, caused by its scientific usage. A homunculus can be understood as a sensory map of a human body. It presents each part of his body by proportion to its number of sensory neural connections. This proportions gives the creature a comical appearance.\n\nPlease visit my Blog for more films: Jeanneblatt.wordpress.com", "title": "Homunculus Clone Experiment / Epic Scientist (funny animation)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-13T14:05:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACmzHiwUp80", "description": "Japanese funk band Osaka Monaurail's PV. from their new album 'Reality For The People'(2006).", "title": "Quick Sand by Osaka Monaurail", "publishedDate": "2006-12-29T13:36:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "ACnHZTRyJF4", "description": "Visit the official site: http://itv.com/xfactor\n\nWell we weren\u2019t expecting this song from Ben Haenow, but does it work?

The Black Swan  - Cygnus atratus -  is a large waterbird, a species of Swan, which breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia. Black Swans are primarily black-feathered birds, with white flight feathers. The bill is bright red, with a pale bar and tip; and legs and feet are greyish-black. Cobs (males) are slightly larger than pens (females), with a longer and straighter bill. Cygnets (immature birds) are a greyish-brown with pale-edged feathers. The Black Swan is almost exclusively herbivorous, and while there is some regional and seasonal variation, the diet is generally dominated by aquatic and marshland plants. In New South Wales the leaf of reedmace (genus Typha) is the most important food of birds in wetlands, followed by submerged algae and aquatic plants like Vallisneria. In Queensland aquatic plants like Potamogeton and stoneworts and algae are the dominant foods. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan\n\nBenbow Pond lies on the Cowdray Estate near Midhurst in Sussex.  The Pond is home to a wide range of birds, ducks and Black Swans.  On the East shore of the Pond is a Memorial or Folly constructed in memory of the 3rd Viscount of Cowdray who died in 2000.  Close by at the Northern end of the Pond are some holiday cottages and to West lies a Golf Course.  The area has many paths and walks surrounding it and is popular spot for a cup of coffee, lunch and tea or just a few minutes peacefull rest. http://www.360cities.net/image/benbow-pond-south-side-cowdray-park-midhurst#-678.34,50.13,110.0\n\nSvartir Svanir hafa komi\u00f0 til \u00cdslands og eru einkum skemmtilegir og velkomnir gestir.

Ultimately we want to make solar harvesting surfaces that you do not even know are there,\u201d Lunt said in a MSU press release.\n\nMost solar panels capture visible spectrum light, which represents just a small segment of electromagnetic wave spectrum. The transparent luminescent solar concentrator (TLSC) doesn\u2019t capture visible light, but non-visible ultraviolet waves are absorbed by the device.\n\nThe concentrator then converts it into another colorless infrared wavelength and sends it to the edge of the concentrator, where photovoltaic solar cells convert light energy to electricity.\n\nRight now the TLSC is performing at around 1% efficiency, but the MSU team believes it can be optimized to around 5%. Currently, non-transparent luminescent concentrators perform can achieve 7% efficiency, at best.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

Homeowner's insurance does not cover termite damage.\n\nPalmetto Exterminators has over 50 years of experience and two graduate entomologists on staff, Palmetto Exterminators is always searching for innovative ways to improve our customer service and satisfaction.\nPalmetto Exterminators places emphasis on the education and training of our employees with special attention given to providing first-rate termite and pest control protection in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThe Palmetto Family\nSince 1960, we have been building long-lasting relationships with co-workers and customers. We understand that the key component to our company's strength, longevity and success is our employees. By providing a stable work environment and family atmosphere, Palmetto Exterminators has a record of high employee retention, which positions us to be the best at meeting our customers' needs.\n\nOur History\nPalmetto Exterminators, Inc. was established in 1960 in Walterboro, South Carolina. Albert and Lillian Snyder purchased the company in 1976, and the company has been in the Snyder family since that time. Albert \"Bud\" Snyder is a graduate of Penn State with degrees in Education and Entomology and has spent his entire career in the pest control industry.  In 1976, Bud Snyder put his knowledge and experience to work at Palmetto Exterminators.\nDuring the late 70's and early 80's, Palmetto Exterminators expanded adding branch offices in Beaufort and Charleston. In 1990, Bud and Lillian's youngest son, Bert Snyder, an entomology graduate from Clemson University, joined his parents in the family business and took responsibility for management of the Charleston branch office. During the 1990's, Palmetto Exterminators expanded again to meet the demands of its customers opening a Summerville branch office and a Greenville branch office. In 1999, with the retirement of Lillian Snyder, son Lance Snyder joined his brother in the family business bringing with him 15 years experience in accounting and business management.\nPalmetto Exterminators has continued to prosper in the new Millennium adding two more branch offices -- Columbia, South Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2003, Bert and Lance Snyder established Palmetto Mosquito Control, LLC, in an effort once again to meet the needs and concerns of their valued customer base. Focusing on the values of honesty, integrity, professionalism, leadership, safety and family, instilled in them by their parents Bud and Lil Snyder, Bert and Lance Snyder have propelled Palmetto Exterminators to one of the best, most innovative and most respected pest control companies, not only in the Carolinas and Georgia, but in the United States.\n\nPest control refers to the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest, usually because it is perceived to be detrimental to a person's health, the ecology or the economy.\nPractitioners of pest control are referred to as exterminators.\n\nTermites are a group of eusocial insects that, until recently, were classified at the taxonomic rank of order Isoptera (see taxonomy below), but are now accepted as the infraorderIsoptera, of the cockroach order Blattodea. While termites are commonly known, especially in Australia, as \"white ants\", they are for practical purposes unrelated to the ants (although they are prey to some ants, including the acrobat ant).\nThe American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), also colloquially known as the waterbug,but not a true waterbug since it is not aquatic, or misidentified as the palmetto bug, is the largest species of common cockroach, and often considered a pest.\n\n8 Locations serving South Carolina, North Carolina & Georgia\nCharleston, South Carolina\n1.800/585.8019\n843/766.9701\nColumbia, South Carolina\n803/254.5833\nSummerville, South Carolina\n843/873-7997\nGreenville, South Carolina\n1.888/293.3377\n864/233.3377\nHilton Head Area, South Carolina\n843.645.9550.\nCharlotte, North Carolina\n704/882.0641\nWalterboro, South Carolina\n1.800/334.5122\n843/549.1531\nMyrtle Beach Area\n843.215.2721\nPalmetto Mosquito Control\nCharleston: 843/766.9701\nHilton Head: 843/785.2399\n\nFor a free, no obligation inspection of your home or business, please complete the free inspection form at palmettoexterminators.net/free-inspection/ and we'll take it from there.\nOne of Palmetto Exterminators' trained professionals will contact you upon receiving your inspection request and set up a date and time that is convenient for you.

But the God of Matchmaking here is very famous and after praying, I had many more opportunities to meet people,\" says Alvin. \n\nYouths like Alvin are flocking to 'love' temples like Taipei's City God Temple \n\nOn a busy weekend, almost 3,000 young devotees would be jostling to pray for a partner. \n\n\"In the past, more educated people hardly come here. It's mostly mothers, villagers or elderly folks. But now many IT professionals visit us now, says Chen Huang Huang, administrator at the City God Temple. \n\nAccording to the temple, over 6,000 couples last year found partners after praying to the Matchmaking God. \n\nTheir good fortune can be seen in the stacks of engagement cookies they bring back in thanks. \n\nIf you are sick of all that speed dating, bar hopping and want to find a mate the traditional way, this is how it's done in Taiwan. \n\nFirst you have to buy some love products, which cost about US$10. And in the product, you'll find a red thread and lead money which symbolises love. Take these to the God of Matchmaking and before you pray, you have to introduce yourself, giving your name, age and address and most importantly, what you want in your partner. \n\nYoung Taiwanese are also flocking to Taipei's Longshan Temple to pray for love. \n\nEven tourists from Japan and South Korea have also been coming to try their luck. \n\nThey pray to a deity called 'The Old Man under the Moon' who is believed to have helped thousands tie the knot. \n\n\"My friend found love after praying here, so he must be very effective,\" says one Taiwanese. \n\nThis method may not be scientifically proven but the government should take heart in this growing fervency. \n\nAfter all, Taiwan is seeing plummeting birthrates and initiatives to encourage more babies haven't borne results. \n\nDespite modern dating services, Taiwanese are also getting hitched much later. \n\nThe average marrying age in Taipei for men is now over 34 and women over 30 years. \n\nSo for Taiwan's busy young professionals, if modern methods of matchmaking don't work, maybe they're better off doing things the old fashioned way. - CNA /ls", "title": "Young Taiwanese seek partners at 'love' temples", "publishedDate": "2007-03-19T23:49:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADBHkbanZSQ", "description": "Skater offers an endless stream of user-generated content that can be explored in open-world gameplay environments.", "title": "Skater - Launch Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T17:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADBHnv0JXHc", "description": "http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/devil-came-to-me/id307303499", "title": "DOVER - Judas", "publishedDate": "2012-08-16T12:42:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADBZqmalaj8", "description": "http://www.biosan.lv/eng/index.php?page=psu-2t\n\nShaker PSU-2T provides adjustable mixing of reagents in microtest plates.

Douleurs au froid et au sucr\u00e9 signent le plus souvent une carie active ou une d\u00e9nudation du collet dentaire, qu'il est urgent de faire traiter.\nDental caries (Latin, \"rot\"), also known as tooth decay or a cavity, is an infection, bacterial in origin, that causes demineralization and destruction of the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum). It is a result of the production of acid by bacterial fermentation of food debris accumulated on the tooth surface.[1] If demineralization exceeds saliva and other remineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes, these once hard tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries (cavities or carious lesions, that is, holes in the teeth). Today, caries remains one of the most common diseases throughout the world. Cariology is the study of dental caries.", "title": "\u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646 - \u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c \u062a\u0633\u0648\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T21:14:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADEzpL3bTFs", "description": "A man rescued a dog from being killed by an elevator and the whole incident was caught on a security camera in Perm, Russia.

Do you believe in psychic phenomenon?\n\nHeater: I do.\n\nRogue:You do, I'm sure you'd believe a cool demonstration of psychic phenomenon. I just need a number, I guess between one and a thousand, a three digit number.\n\nHeather: Um, 642. \n\nRogue: 642. You wanna change your mind or that's a good number? 642. I'm gonna actually ask you now to randomize this number. What is the reverse of 642?\n\nHeather: Um, 246.\n\nRogue: 246. All right, let's subtract these numbers.\n\nHeater: 642. 246. 396.\n\nRogue: 396?\n\nHeather: Yeah. \n\nRogue: Actually, let's randomize some more. What's the reverse for 396?\n\nHeather: 693.\n\nRogue: 693. And instead of subtracting them let's add them together. What number do you have for that? 396, plus 693. \n\nHeather: 1089. One thousand 89. \n\nRogue: One thousand eight-nine. Totally random number, would you say?\n\nHeater: Yep. \n\nRogue: Well, it's crazy. Before this uh, trick started, I wrote (?) on the back from last night, it happens to be 1089. Isn't that great?  \n\nHeather: That's crazy.\n\nRogue: Totally crazy. \n\nBasically what you're going to do is have your spectator name any three digit number. You can tell them that zero's a no good, not a real number, and don't repeat the numbers, so let's just try, like 123. It can be any three digit number like I said, three different numbers. And you're going tell them you're going to randomize the number. What you're going to do then is basically you're going to reverse the number that they just named, which is 321. And you're going to put the larger number on top of the smaller one and you're going to subtract that number so it's best to have somebody ready with a calculator. In this case let's do this. 198, you tell them, you know what, let's randomize it a little bit more, which you have to do for the trick to actually work, you're going to reverse the new number, 198, which is 891, and this you're going to add, so first subtract, then you're going to add the two numbers together. And believe it or not, you almost always, I would say 95-98 percent, it would equal 1089. \n\nAnd you're probably asking, what's the other number it could be? I would say 2 percent of the time it's going to be the number 99, in which case, you never want to look silly when you're doing a trick for somebody, so I would actually put a paper in my pocket in plain view, just in one pocket so they don't think you have a bunch of predictions all over the place, that says you will pick the number 99, just in case the number turns out to be 99, which is a very slim chance, but it'll either equal 1089, most of the time, or equal 99. I want you to have fun with this, this is amazing, any time there's paper around, pens, you can do this illusion, anytime, anywhere.

Their body shape is very slender and elongated. They have six legs; the first pair is short and stubby while the other two pairs are thin and elongated which are used for moving over the water surface which we call \"walking on water\". The first pair of legs is used for holding its prey, the middle pair propels the bug along the surface of the water with either a rowing or jumping motion, and the hind pair of legs is used as rudders. The entire body of G. lacustris including its legs is covered with many tiny hairs that have a wax-like coating. G. lacustris are dark brown in colour. Water striders have very strong sucking mouthparts known as a rostrum or beak. females are usually significantly larger than the males and the egg production rate is limited by the amount of food resources that are available to the female; the more food there is the more eggs the female lays. The adult water striders emerge around April and May. It is around this time that females lay eggs where the eggs undergo a process that takes about 12 to 14 days to develop before they are able to hatch. Hatching doesn't necessarily follow the eggs when their development is complete; hatching heavily depends on the temperature that the egg is exposed to in its environment. After hatching, G. lacustris go through another separate development process known as incomplete metamorphosis. In this process, the larvae or nymphs progress through a series of moults which basically are stages known as instars. There are five instars in the developmental process, with each one progressively longer than the last. The incomplete metamorphosis process usually lasts about 24 to 30 days for larvae to become an adult. G. lacutris males prolong their mating in the presence of other males because they are guarding their female against harassment from the other males.  It was found that males influence the duration of copulation while the females influence the copulation frequency.

The pondskater will then 'row' across the water at high speed to investigate and secure its prey, using its front legs to grasp the victim. It flies well as an adult and quickly colonises a newly created garden pond. Nymphs June to August.

In the spring, they form pairs, and before mating, row about together on the surface during the daytime. At night, they separate, and the females lay their eggs beneath the water in closely packed patches. Normally the eggs are laid on the surface of flat stones.See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerris_najas\n\nDuck weed - Lemna minor\nFloating fern - Salvinium natans", "title": "Pond Skater - Gerris  - Water strider -  Vatnaskord\u00fdr - P\u00f6ddur", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T16:16:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "ADTUOqF-XCs", "description": "Dragonica EU Fenir Server.
