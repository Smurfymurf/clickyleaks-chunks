The Mercurial Superfly IV is designed for the player who is always a step ahead of his marker and the game itself. This boot allows players to unlock their potential and earn that split second that can open up the game.\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS \nThe Mercurial Superfly's revolutionary design is driven through Nike's most advanced technology: Nike Flyknit. A new three-knit weave puts less material between the foot and the ball to enhance players' touch -- a vital element when operating at high speeds.\n\nThe high-top Dynamic Fit Collar, which radically transforms the Mercurial silhouette, is designed to create a better fit and a heightened sensation of the boot as an extension of the foot.\n\nOther vital breakthrough additions include Superfly's Brio cables, which are knitted directly into the upper and locked into the outsole. By connecting this tendon-like support to the heel, the Superfly acts like a slingshot that helps propel the player forward. In addition, a new, more-flexible full-length carbon plate helps players to more efficiently transmit power through the ground.\n\nAdded studs at the boot's heel offer stability, and extra traction has been placed at the toe to give players more grip and propulsion during the critical final 10 percent of their stride.", "title": "Nike Football: Flyknit Mercurial Superfly IV", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T14:03:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7kmSQe-GTe8", "description": "\u3088\u3053\u3061\u3087\u306e\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3084\u3064\u7b11", "title": "8EST", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T08:42:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7kmV1WvYi_k", "description": "A lesson in rouge's.

This test involves removing small amount of amniotic fluid (the fluid surrounding a developing fetus) from the uterus. The amniotic fluid can be tested to determine if the fetus has certain kinds of birth defects.\n\nAn ultrasound is used to visualize the baby and a very thin needle is inserted into the lower abdomen (not through the belly button) and small amount (about one ounce) of amniotic fluid is removed. The amniotic fluid contains fetal skin cells that have sloughed off and are floating in the amniotic fluid. These skin cells are taken to a laboratory and a karyotype test is performed to give a picture of the baby's chromosomes. FISH testing may also be performed.\n\nWhat does an amniocentesis test for?\n\nIn general, an amniocentesis tests for two things -- chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome, and neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly.\n\nA karyotype or FISH test is done on the fetal skin cells to look at the fetal chromosomes. The most common chromosome abnormality is Down syndrome which is cause by having an extra #21 chromosome.\n\nAn amniocentesis also tests for other chromosome abnormalities including trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. Testing detects over 99% of all chromosome abnormalities. An amniocentesis tests for open neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by measuring a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) which detects 96% of all open neural tube defects.\n\nWhat Doesn't an Amniocentesis Test For?\n\nNeither amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling can test for all birth defects. Every pregnancy has a risk of about 3% to 5% for different types of birth defects including things such as autism, cleft lip, forms of mental retardation other than Down syndrome and heart defects. No prenatal test is available to test for all birth defects. So while normal results from an amniocentesis are reassuring, they are not a 100% guarantee that your baby will have no health problems.\n\nIf you are worried about a specific genetic disorder that you are worried about, you may want to ask your doctor or genetic counselor if testing is prenatal testing is available for that disorder.\n\nWhat does an amniocentesis really feel like?\n\nMost women are surprised at how painless an amniocentesis is. Some women have an uncomfortable pressure or cramping feeling during the procedure but most feel no pain at all. The procedure is generally quick -- about 30 seconds to one minute. An ultrasound is used throughout the procedure to monitor the position of the baby and to make sure that the needle doesn't touch the baby.\n\nHow does an amniocentesis diagnose Down syndrome?\n\nAmniotic fluid contains fetal skin cells that have sloughed off. These skin cells are taken to a laboratory and tested to determine if the fetus has Down syndrome. Two different tests -- FISH testing and karyotyping -- can be done to determine if a fetus has Down syndrome. Both FISH testing and karyotyping directly analyze the fetus's chromosomes and determine whether or not the fetus has Down syndrome or another trisomy. FISH testing does not give you a complete picture of all the baby's chromosomes, but it can give you a quick answer about trisomies. Results of a FISH test are generally available in 3 to 4 days. A karyotype takes longer (up to two weeks), but gives you more complete information about the baby's chromosomes.\n\nResults\n\nIf your results are abnormal, you should talk with your doctor or with a genetics specialist about what your results mean.

Description of historical background of the ancient communities\n\n==Views==\n\nMufti Muhammad Iqbal Kharal, the Khatib of Hazrat Mian Mir Mosque, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had a distinguished status among the contemporary intellectuals and scholars. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had tried to spread the gnosis of the Holy Qur`an in the world by undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an. He said Shaykh-ul-Islam was such personality who was uniting Umma on a single platform as well as spreading the Quranic teachings in the modern way.\n\nDr Jamil-ur-Rahman Chishti of the Chishtia Abad, Kamoki, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadris translation of the Holy Qur`an enlightens the readers with the real spirit of the Holy Book. The unique and lucid style of translation distinguishes Irfan-ul-Qur`an from the existing body of translations. \n\nCentral Amir of Jamat Ahl Hadith, Pakistan, Allama Zubair Ahmad Zaheer said that Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri did full justice to the demands of translation and rendered the translation beautifully by rising above sectarian affiliations. He congratulated Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri for doing translation of the Holy Qur`an for the entire Muslim Umma and all sects. \n\nRenowned scholar Dr Tahir Hameed Tanoli said that if the translations of the Holy Qur`an done in the subcontinent were the tree, Irfan-ul-Qur`an, the translation of the Holy Quran by Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was its fruit. This translation had the unique quality of an exegesis in terms of its meaningfulness. Shaykh-ul-Islams translation of the Holy Book was a great scholarly feat of the contemporary age from which the Umma would continue to derive benefit for centuries. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has made the reverence for the Holy Prophet (saw) the pivot and no where does the translation go away from this.\n\nKhawaja Muin-ud-Din Koraija of Kot Mitthan said that Irfan-ul-Qur`an would continue to be read till the Day of Judgment. Irfan-ul-Qur`an not only removes the doubts and reservations of the modern mind but also offers remedy for the scourge of sectarianism. Our society is engulfed in terrorism. The Islamic message of peace was the dire need of the hour and Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is known as an ambassador of peace in the entire world. He also declared to hold the inauguration ceremony of Irfan-ul-Qur`an in the annual spiritual celebrations of Kot Mitthan.\n\nPrincipal of Pakistan Law College, Dr Hamayun Ihsan, said in his talk that undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an was the most difficult job of the world. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri deserved felicitation that he did a great favour to the Umma by doing simple, lucid and modern translation of the Holy Qur`an, which is also compatible with the contemporary demands. Dr Ihsan said that if the translations of the quality books were undertaken, it would go a long way in guiding people through a maze of problems. The Umma could regain its lost glory by reading Irfan-ul-Qur`an, for such is its scholarly depth.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith Muhammad Mi`raj-ul-Islam said that there were a few translation of the Holy Qur`an, which did not contain the element of reverence and respect. Irfan-ul-Qur`an is such a valuable treasure as removes all doubts and enhances respect for the holy personages.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith of Jamea Nizamia, Lahore Maulana Abdut Tawab Siddique said in his speech that there was dire need of reviving our relationship with the holy Quran. This endeavour of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri really deserves appreciation. His Quranic translation \"Irfan-ul-Quran\" is a became of light for all Muslims.\n\nArab scholars, ash-Shaykh Dr al-Farfur, ash-Shaykh Dr Sayyid Mahmud Abu al-Huda al-Husaini and ash-Shaykh As`ad Muhammad Sa`id as-Sagharji also addressed at the ceremony at the occasion. They said that they could not fully benefit from Irfan-ul-Qur`an because of their ignorance of the Urdu language, which they branded as great deprivation.", "title": "Irfan ul Quran, Sura Al-Quraysh (106) by Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T11:36:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7l67Wv0rk4U", "description": "Aqui una nueva faceta de David Coronilla, la Saeta este chaval le mete a to los palos", "title": "Saeta David Coronilla", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T22:38:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7l6epR2EHvA", "description": "A Stinkhorn (Mutinus sp) fungus attracting insects, Nam Lik, Laos.", "title": "Stinkhorn fungus, Laos. 20110712_092034.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T23:20:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7l6ts1YwnfU", "description": "In this video you'll see how you can do plywood subfloor leveling using the plywood sheets.

no matter the cost.\n\nDirector: Micha\u00ebl Roskam\n\nWriters: Dennis Lehane\n\nActors: Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, James Gandolfini, Matthia Schoenaerts, John Ortiz, Ann Dowd, James Frecheville\n\nIn Theaters September 19th, 2014\n\n\u00a9 2014 Fox Searchlight Pictures", "title": "The Drop Official Trailer (2014) Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace HD", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T18:19:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7lD-Qc7GRAY", "description": "\u0397 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03b9\u03b1 \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a4\u03b6\u03b9\u03ce\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd) \u03ba\u03b9 \u03bf \u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0396\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2/\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2) \u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03ac\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. \u03a4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5.\n\u0391\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0398\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9, \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7.\n\u0393\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \"\u0393\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 -

Nel 2011, dopo un'incessante attivit\u00e0 live, Salmo produce il primo disco solista \"The Island Chainshaw Massacre\" dove mischia sonorit\u00e0 elettroniche e rap anni 90, tratto distintivo e rivoluzionario per il panorama rap italiano.\n\nLo stesso anno SALMO si trasferisce a Milano con la sua Machete Crew e, a inizi 2012, in una sola settimana d\u00e0 vita - per Tanta Roba, l'etichetta indipendente di Gu\u00e8 Pequeno e Dj Harsh - all'album della svolta: \"Death USB\". Il disco va subito al primo posto in classifica su iTunes nella settimana di Sanremo. SALMO diventa cos\u00ec l'artista pi\u00f9 cliccato, davanti ai big della musica italiana e internazionale. Si aggiudica anche un MTV Music Awards nella categoria Best Crossover.

Though one of the most remarkable of modern classical composers, C\u00e9sar Franck labored for many years in comparative obscurity. After some preliminary studies at Li\u00e9ge he came to Paris in 1837 and entered the Conservatoire. He at once obtained the first prize for piano, transposing a fugue at sight to the astonishment of the professors, for he was only fifteen. He won the prize for the organ in 1841, after which he settled down in the French capital as teacher of the piano. His earliest compositions date from this period, and include four trios for piano and strings, besides several piano pieces. Ruth, a biblical cantata was produced with success at the Conservatoire in 1846. An opera entitled Le Valet de Ferme was written about this time, but has never been performed. For many years Franck led a retired life, devoting himself to teaching and to his duties as organist, first at Saint-Jean-Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, then at Ste. Clotilde, where he acquired a great reputation as an improviser. He also wrote a mass, heard in 1861, and a quantity of motets, organ pieces and other works of a religious character.\n\nFranck was appointed professor of the organ at the Paris Conservatoire, in succession to Benoist, his old master, in 1872, and the following year he was naturalized a Frenchman. Until then he was esteemed as a clever and conscientious musician, but be was now about to prove his title to something more. A revival of his early oratorio, Ruth, had brought his name again before the public, and this was followed by the production of R\u00e9demption, a work for solo, chorus and orchestra, given under the direction of M. Colonne on the 10th of April 1873. The unconventionality of the music rather disconcerted the general public, but the work nevertheless made its mark, and Franck became the central figure of an enthusiastic circle of pupils and adherents whose devotion atoned for the comparative indifference of the masses.\n\nHis creative power now manifested itself in a series of works of varied kinds, and the name of Franck began gradually to emerge from its obscurity. The following is an enumeration of his subsequent compositions: Rebecca (1881), a biblical idyll for solo, chorus and orchestra; Les B\u00e9atitudes, an oratorio composed between 1870 and 1880, perhaps his greatest work; the symphonic poems, Les \u00c9olides (1876), Le Chasseur Maudit (1883), Les Djinns (1884), for piano and orchestra; Psyche (1888), for orchestra and chorus; symphonic variations for piano and orchestra (1885); symphony in D (1889); quintet for piano and strings (1880); sonata for piano and violin (1886); string quartet (1889); prelude, choral and fugue for piano (1884); prelude, aria and finale for piano (1889); various songs, notably \"La Procession\" and \"Les Cloches du Soir.\" Franck also composed two four-act operas, Hulda and Ghiselle, both of which were produced at Monte Carlo after his death, which took place in Paris on the 8th of November 1890. The second of these was left by the master in an unfinished state, and the instrumentation was completed by several of his pupils.\n\nC\u00e9sar Franck's influence on younger French composers has been very great. Yet his music is German in character rather than French. A more sincere, modest, self-respecting composer probably never existed. In the centre of the brilliant French capital he was able to lead a laborious existence consecrated to his threefold career of organist, teacher and composer. He never sought to gain the suffrages of the public by unworthy concessions, but kept straight on his path, ever mindful of an ideal to be reached and never swerving therefrom. A statue was erected to the memory of C\u00e9sar Franck in Paris on the 22nd of October 1904, the occasion producing a panegyric from Alfred Bruneau, in which he speaks of the composer's works as \"cathedrals in sound.\"", "title": "Stokowski/Philadelphia - Franck: Panis Angelicus (Instrumental)", "publishedDate": "2010-05-31T00:53:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "7lFe9DmbL60", "description": "Well this is me and my friends biology music video project.

Es 10,000 m\u00e1s potente que la quimioterapia. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no estamos enterados de ello? Porque existen organizaciones interesadas en encontrar una versi\u00f3n sint\u00e9tica, que les permita obtener fabulosas utilidades. As\u00ed que de ahora en adelante usted puede ayudar a un amigo que lo necesite, haci\u00e9ndole saber que le conviene beber jugo de guan\u00e1bana para prevenir la enfermedad. Su sabor es agradable. Y por supuesto no produce los horribles efectos de la quimioterapia. Y s\u00ed tiene la posibilidad de hacerlo, plante un \u00e1rbol de guan\u00e1bana en su patio trasero.

No ocupa mucho espacio, Se le conoce con el nombre de Graviola en Brasil, guan\u00e1bana en Hispanoam\u00e9rica, y \"Soursop\" en Ingl\u00e9s.\nLa fruta es muy grande y su pulpa blanca, dulce, se come directamente o se la emplea normalmente, para elaborar bebidas, sorbetes, dulces etc. El inter\u00e9s de esta planta se debe a sus fuertes efectos anti cancer\u00edgenos.

The line-up was rounded off by cimbalom-player, when they were playing in a fixed location (since it took two people to carry the instrument).\nThese well-known musicians were from Borsodb\u00f3ta, while the middle \"first\" soloist Rudi Balogh came from the town of \u00d3zd. To the best of my knowledge all of them had a full-time day job (either in the mine or the sheet-metal works in N\u00e1dasd, or for example Rudi was a forklift driver in the \u00d3zd steelworks). By that time the music had already become \"just\" a part-time job, although if they were hired to play at a lot of weddings or christenings they could earn more this way than from their day jobs.\nTheir patrons were almost exclusively Hungarian villagers. By this time most of the villagers had begun commuting to the towns, since after the 1960s the traditional peasantry largely disappeared owing to the enforced nationalisation and collectivisation of agriculture. The villagers also worked full-time in heavy industry (mining, smelting) or possibly on the collective farms, but despite this they retained their connection with the land, and as a part-time occupation they would cultivate the remaining smaller private plots of land or allotments, and kept a few animals. By doing this they could even scrape together enough money to hire a large band for major celebrations, such as weddings. On such occasions the gypsy bands would play the songs requested by the Hungarians, a great many of which were the traditional Hungarian folk song, but many guests would ask for a \"czardas\" accompanied by a new-style folk melody, while in the more traditionalist areas such as the Hangony valley requests for old-style folk songs were also common. The communities of herdsmen that still existed at that time (in this area mainly shepherds), who continued to practice their ancient skills even in the era of the collective farms, adhered rigorously to their old-fashioned culture. \nTo their dying day, these herders preferred the melodies and herding songs associated with the older forms of Hungarian folk music, which is why we have placed so much emphasis on collecting the traditional \"bacsos\" shepherding tunes in the course of our travels. All the rural Gypsy musicians were full of stories when they played for the herders: \"they really knew how to have a good time\", etc. \nAlthough Rudi performed a lot in the villages, he differed from the rural musicians in that he had also played in restaurants in the town of \u00d3zd, and even toured abroad with the \u00d3zd folk dancing troupe and performed for the \"bigwigs\" in the management of the \u00d3zd smelting works. Naturally, he always played whatever songs were requested.\n-------------------------------\nBorsodb\u00f3t\u00e1n \"F\u00fctty\u00f6s Bandi\" mutatta meg nekem ezt az arch\u00edv k\u00e9pet, melyet valamikor az 1970es \u00e9vekben k\u00e9sz\u00edthettek.\nEgy falusi magyar cig\u00e1nyzenekart \u00e1br\u00e1zol, \u00fagynevezett \"nagyzenekart\", mely ezen a k\u00e9pen h\u00e1rom ! pr\u00edm\u00e1sb\u00f3l (k\u00f6z\u0171l\u00fck egy bizony\u00e1ra terces lehetett), egy klarin\u00e9tosb\u00f3l, k\u00e9t br\u00e1cs\u00e1sb\u00f3l \u00e9s k\u00e9t b\u0151g\u0151sb\u0151l \u00e1ll.

Vohra Wound Physicians: Healing Wounds, Saving Lives\n\nToday's healthcare environment -- and the economic environment in general -- necessitate efforts to lower healthcare costs, both for patients and for providers. This need is especially relevant to long-term care facilities, where residents' healthcare problems are a daily and expensive certainty. Both pressure ulcers and venous ulcers are common in long-term facilities, and the aging of our citizens means managing these facilities will be an increasingly significant concern for providers.\n\n\nA recent study shows that a multi-disciplinary team approach that focuses on standardized care and prevention can dramatically reduce costs and improve outcomes. In a report published in Ostomy Wound Management, researchers conducted a retrospective study of two groups of Medicare patients. One group received  pro-active, standardized  multi-disciplinary  wound care -- a protocol provided by Vohra Wound Physicians. The second group received a range of cares as would be expected in most nursing care environments.  \n\nThe standardized wound care protocol consisted of sharp debridement of nonviable tissue at the bedside and early aggressive topical treatment of wounds to prevent the need for systemic treatments. In addition, the wound care team addressed nutrition, wound offloading, vascular compromise, physical therapy, pain and diabetes control, and other support services.\n\nThe research revealed that the proactive team approach lead to wounds healing 21 days faster than traditional methods, an 88% reduction in wound related hospitalizations and a savings of over $19,000 for each wound incident -- a 47% savings for each Medicare patient.\n\nDr. Shark Bird, Chief Medical Director of Vohra Would Healing, commented, \"We see patients in nursing homes that have various kinds of ulcers. We see lots of patients with pressure ulcers. These patients in the past have been shipped out to a wound care center or a hospital. But, it made more sense for a patient to be seen in their own setting. So, our physicians combine with nursing home chains, like Avante for instance. We come directly into the facility and provide the same service to the patient at the bedside. We do bedside debridements when necessary, whenever there is necrotic tissue that needs to be removed. We can come back on a weekly basis to assure treatments we implemented the previous week are working the way we want them to.\"\n\nNursing home chains such as Avante partner with the Vohra Physicians to reduce re-hospitalizations and improve outcomes for their patients. Progressive nursing homes realize that treating these patients' wounds at bedside without the need to send the patients out to wound centers  enhance wound healing times and patient satisfaction. \n\nMichael Lubeslove, a patient at Avante at Lake Worth commented: \"I first ended up in a skilled nursing facility, because I had very bad stage 4 plus bed sores on numerous parts of my body. I feel I should have come here first, because of the service, the kindness, and the way they do it. Previously, they had me in wound vacs, hyperbaric chambers. I came here and the doctor said no. We don't need that. We're going to heal you and we're going to heal you good. I am now, in little more than a year, almost 100 per cent healed - out of eight years of having these wounds. It has totally changed my life.

Swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to other aerial insectivores, such as the related martins and the unrelated swifts.\n\nWire-tailed swallow breeds in Africa south of the Sahara and in tropical southern Asia from the Indian subcontinent east to southeast Asia. It is mainly resident, but populations in Pakistan and northern India migrate further south in winter.\n\nThis species is an uncommon vagrant to Sri Lanka.\n\nThis bird is found in open country near water and human habitation. Wire-tailed swallows are fast flyers and they generally feed on insects, especially flies, while airborne. They are typically seen low over water, with which they are more closely associated than most swallows.\n\nThe neat half-bowl nests are lined with mud collected in the swallows' beaks. They are placed on vertical surfaces near water under cliff ledges or more commonly on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges.\n\nThe clutch is three to four eggs in Africa, up to five in Asia (Turner and Rose). These birds are solitary and territorial nesters, unlike many swallows, which tend to be colonial.\n\nThis striking species is a small swallow at 14 cm in length. It has bright blue upperparts, except for a chestnut crown and white spots on the tail. The underparts are white, with darker flight feathers. There is a blue mask through the eye.\n\nThis species gets its name from the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. Sexes manifest similar appearances, but the female has shorter \"wires\". Juveniles have a brown crown, back and tail. The Asian form, H. s. filifera, is larger and longer-tailed than the abundant African H. s. smithii.\n\nThe scientific name of this bird is after Professor Chetien Smith, a Norwegian botanist, who was a member of the British expedition to the Congo River in 1816, led by James Kingston Tuckey.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Species in the family include white-tailed deer, mule deer such as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou), fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the Barbary stag, a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa.\nDeer live in a variety of biomes, ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\nDeer weights generally range from 30 to 300 kg (70 to 700 lb). The smallest species, the northern pud\u00fa, averages 10 kg (20 lb) and the largest, the moose, averages 431 kg (1,000 lb). They generally have lithe, compact bodies and long, powerful legs suited for rugged woodland terrain. Deer are also excellent jumpers and swimmers. Deer are ruminants, or cud-chewers, and have a four-chambered stomach. The teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation, and like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors, instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw. Some deer, such as those on the island of R\u00f9m, do consume meat when it is available.\nSources :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer", "title": "Deer  in The Alipore Zoo,India", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T05:46:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7lkY1I7TnqE", "description": "Video con explicaci\u00f3n de problema usando el principio de Bernoulli.", "title": "Principio de Bernoulli, ejercicio 2", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T19:09:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7lks1Cr7R3o", "description": "Salwar Kameez for girls is one of the divisions in Indian fashion that has been most explored and exploited by textile traders.

The remixers were picked carefully, all 3 versions show different kind of sound on the original theme presented by the greek prog master Christos Fourkis, Poland's beloved phenomenon Monojoke and a newcomer talent from Hungary, Markus Greg.\n\nOriginal mix is a slow building progressive piece, with sacred momentums and melancholic upbeat. Christos Fourkis dropped his own, unique soundprints alongside the main parts, from which he created an airy, mediterranean taste production.\nMonojoke did a simply amazing retouch, with deep vibe on a progressive foundation, including some driving tribal and percussion elements.\nMarkus Greg focused on the dancefloor, his techy reinterpretation oparating with a massive baseline and a wonderul synth theme.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. They are the only surviving proboscideans; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). These animals have several distinctive features, including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Hubble eXtreme Deep Field - Farthest Ever View of the Universe. Hubble goes to the eXtreme to assemble farthest ever view of the Universe. Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) pushes back the frontiers of time and space.\n\nThis video explains how astronomers meticulously assembled mankind's deepest view of the universe from combining Hubble Space Telescope exposures taken over the past decade. Guest scientists are Dr. Garth Illingworth and Dr. Marc Postman.\n\n---\nPlease subscribe to Science & Reason:\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/Best0fScience\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/ScienceTV\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/FFreeThinker\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/RationalHumanism\n---\n\nLike photographers assembling a portfolio of best shots, astronomers have assembled a new, improved portrait of mankind's deepest-ever view of the universe. Called the eXtreme Deep Field, or XDF, the photo was assembled by combining 10 years of NASA Hubble Space Telescope photographs taken of a patch of sky at the center of the original Hubble Ultra Deep Field.\n\nThe XDF is a small fraction of the angular diameter of the full Moon. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is an image of a small area of space in the constellation Fornax, created using Hubble Space Telescope data from 2003 and 2004. By collecting faint light over many hours of observation, it revealed thousands of galaxies, both nearby and very distant, making it the deepest image of the universe ever taken at that time.\n\nThe new full-color XDF image reaches much fainter galaxies and includes very deep exposures in red light from Hubble's new infrared camera, enabling new studies of the earliest galaxies in the universe. The XDF contains about 5,500 galaxies even within its smaller field of view. The faintest galaxies are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see.\n\n\u2022 http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/37/\n\n---\n\nFlight Through the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field\n\nThis scientific visualization depicts a flight through the galaxies in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). Using measured and estimated distances for approximately three thousand galaxies, astronomers and visualizers constructed a three-dimensional model of the XDF galaxy distribution. The camera traverses more than thirteen billion light-years of space. For cinematic reasons, the exceedingly vast distances in the 3D model have been greatly compressed.\n\nScience Credit: G. Illingworth, P. Oesch, and D. Magee (University of California, Santa Cruz)\n\n---\n\nFlight Through the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (2D Zoom and 3D Fly-Through Sequence)\n\nThis video begins with a zoom into the small area of sky that the Hubble Space Telescope observed to construct the eXtreme Deep Field, or XDF. The region is located in the southern sky, far away from the glare of the Milky Way, the bright plane of our galaxy. In terms of angular size, the field is a fraction the angular diameter of the full Moon, yet it contains thousands of galaxies stretching back across time.\n\nThe video then depicts a flight through the galaxies in the XDF. Using measured and estimated redshifts for approximately three thousand galaxies, astronomers and visualizers constructed a three-dimensional model of the XDF galaxy distribution. The camera starts from Hubble's viewpoint, traverses more than thirteen billion light-years of space, and exits the data set past a \"red dot\" galaxy (or proto-galaxy) with a redshift of 7.82. For cinematic reasons, the exceedingly vast distances in the 3D model have been greatly compressed.\n\n---\n\nXDF Moon Comparison Video\n\nThis video compares the angular size of the XDF field to the angular size of the full Moon. The XDF is a very small fraction of sky area, but it provides a \"core sample\" of the heavens by penetrating deep into space over a sightline of over 13 billion light-years. Several thousand galaxies are contained within this small field of view. At an angular diameter of one-half degree, the Moon spans an area of sky only one-half the width of a finger held at arm's length.\n\n---\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, and M. Estacion, G. Bacon, L.

People tend to/ are conditioned think that these signifiers, i.e., symbols, or dots, or sounds, signify a real, an actual apple (the signified). Although, at the beginning of our evolutionary history, when we were living in the state of nature and the language just began to be formed, one could show a physical apple on a tree (the signified) and call it with using one's voice as an 'apple' (the signifier). But following the complete development of language and invention of writing, no longer have the signifiers signified anything, the 'signified'; they are merely symbols and signifies nothing:\n\n\"...Such is the strange 'being' of the sign (a): half of it always 'not there' (b) and the other half always 'not that.'

The developing of events and circumstances that are not routine is one of the basic functions of the engineer of consent. Events so planned can be projected over the communication systems to infinitely more people than those actually participating, and such events vividly dramatize ideas for those who do not witness the events. \n\n\"The imaginatively managed event can compete successfully with other events for attention. Newsworthy events, involving people, usually do not happen by accident.

Molen, Robert Raymond, Lew Rywin, Steven Spielberg\nScreenwriter: Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian\nFilm Description: Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.\n\n\"schindler's list\",\"schindler's list clip\",\"schindler's list theme\",\"schindler's list trailer\",\"liam neeson\",\"embeth davidtz\",\"wine videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",biography,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"inspirational stories\",\"military war dramas\",\"period pieces\",\"steven spielberg\",\"kathleen kennedy\",\"gerald r molen\",\"branko lustig\",\"lew rywin\",\"irving glovin\",\"robert raymond\",\"compassion videos\",\"despair videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++119912,/m/0h5g_,/m/034b7r", "title": "Schindler's List (6/9) Movie CLIP - Helen Hirsch (1993) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T13:49:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7mJdAioYNqw", "description": "After more than a decade, the Wachowski masterpiece is back: discover the First All New Official Trailer of Matrix Reborn, Coming into the Theaters in 2017.\n\nThe Matrix\u00ae - \u00a9 Warner Bros.

Un perro mestizo, sin valor econ\u00f3mico puede proporcionar las satisfacciones a su propietario que el mejor campe\u00f3n; Los perros mestizos no tienen ninguna desventaja demostrada frente a los perros de raza y s\u00ed muchas ventajas. \n\nEn general son extremadamente amables y muy amistosos. Tienen una enorme capacidad de afecto y rebosan cari\u00f1o y si provienen de un refugio \u00e9sta capacidad se multiplica por el anhelo de ser queridos. Adem\u00e1s suelen ser muy inteligentes y f\u00e1cilmente adiestrables. Tratar\u00e1n de complacer a su due\u00f1o en todo. No sufren degeneraci\u00f3nes por consanguinidad como algunas razas puras y gracias a las mezclas de las que provienen disfrutan de graciosas peculiaridades que hacen de cada animal un ejemplar irrepetible, casi exclusivo. \n\nAs\u00ed mismo presentan una admirable resistencia f\u00edsica natural, \u00e9sta se debe precisamente a las mezclas, tambi\u00e9n resultan mucho m\u00e1s resistentes a las enfermedades y gozan de una gran longevidad. Se sabe de ejemplares que han llegado a los 20 a\u00f1os.\n\nA menudo son m\u00e1s tranquilos y equilibrados que sus nobles parientes de pura raza. Los cruces realizados por criadores poco profesionales pueden provocar alteraci\u00f3nes de comportamiento en algunos ejemplares de raza y de problemas degenerativos como sordera, fallas hep\u00e1ticas, hemofilia,c\u00e1ncer, problemas \u00f3seos entre muchos otros. Sin embargo la selecci\u00f3n natural de los mestizos evita casi en la totalidad dichas alteraciones. \n\nEl perro mestizo no es un perro callejero necesariamente. Ni tenemos porque verlo despectivamente. Hoy en d\u00eda muy pocas personas podr\u00edan llamarse de raza pura, si acaso nuestros err\u00f3neamente discriminados ind\u00edgenas, los dem\u00e1s somos mestizos, hijos de la mezcla de muchas r\u00e1zas, as\u00ed que cuando se\u00f1ales con un dedo a un perro y lo llames despectivamente mestizo o cruzado u ordinario no te olvides que tus otros cuatro dedos de la mano apuntan directamente, a t\u00ed. Los perros mestizos llevan generaciones viviendo en casas, conviviendo felizmente con sus due\u00f1os hasta que \u00e9stos, por diferentes circunstancias, cometen el acto inmoral y cruel de abandonarlos en la calle. \n\nPor tanto se trata siempre de ejemplares directamente ligados a la vida en familia, que han pasado escaso tiempo en la calle, y que desean ardientemente la segunda oportunidad que tanto merecen. Adem\u00e1s, y que nos perdonen los puristas, los perros de pura raza no son m\u00e1s que mestizos prolongados en el tiempo. Es absurdo ver como la gente se vanagloria y presume de su perro fino sin saber que su perro tan exclusivo es el resultado final de un mestizaje enfocado a una sola cosa. El comercio. \n\nEs la sangre de nuesros mestizos la que di\u00f3 origen a \u00e9se perro presuntamente \"fino\".

Name: Callisia\nFamilie: Commelinagew\u00e4chse (Commelinaceae)\nWuchsh\u00f6he: 10 bis 30 cm\nSchwierigkeit: pflegeleicht bis mittelschwer\nVerwendung: Blattschmuckpflanze, (vorwiegend als Ampelpflanze)\n\npflegeleicht: F\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger geeignet\nmittelschwer: Erfahrung und durchschnittliche Pflegekenntnisse erforderlich\nanspruchsvoll: Gute Grundkenntnisse der Zimmerpflanzenpflege sind zu empfehlen, diese k\u00f6nnen Sie hier nachlesen: Der gr\u00fcne Daumen\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Callisia\n\nDie Callisia ist eine bodendeckende Pflanze, verwandt mit der Tradescantia. Mit ihren eleganten Trieben ist die Callisia als Ampelpflanze gut geeignet. Je nach Art haben die Bl\u00e4tter eine F\u00e4rbung von olivgr\u00fcn bis purpurrot. Die Callesia sind nicht ganz so pflegeleicht wie die im Wuchsbild sehr \u00e4hnlich aussehenden Tradescantien. Beide Pflanzen sind bodendeckend und eignen sich nicht nur als Ampelpflanzen, sondern auch als Unterpflanzung in gro\u00dfen Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfen solit\u00e4rer stammbildender Zimmerpflanzen.\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Callisia bekommt einen hellen Standort mit ein wenig Sonneneinstrahlung am Vor- oder Nachmittag. Am besten w\u00e4hlt man einen halbschattigen Platz der ganzj\u00e4hrig vor der prallen Mittagssonne gesch\u00fctzt ist. Die Callisia m\u00f6gen keine niedrige Luftfeuchtigkeit.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Wachstumsphase gie\u00dft man die Callisia gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und l\u00e4sst die Erde nicht antrocknen. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit schr\u00e4nkt man das Gie\u00dfen ein. Man gie\u00dft die Callisia m\u00e4\u00dfig und l\u00e4sst die Erde zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben leicht antrocknen. Ballentrockenheit und Staun\u00e4sse m\u00fcssen aber vermieden werden.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Callisia w\u00e4chst problemlos bei Temperaturen zwischen 18 und 22 \u00b0C. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit im Winter sollte man die Callisia f\u00fcr 4 bis 6 Wochen in R\u00e4ume mit ausreichenden Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen und Temperaturen zwischen 16 und 18 \u00b0C stellen.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nDie Callisia vermehrt man im Fr\u00fchjahr durch 10 bis 15 cm lange Kopfstecklinge. Man kann die abgeschnittenen Stecklinge direkt in Gruppen von  5 bis 10 St\u00fcck in kleine T\u00f6pfe einsetzen. Als Substrat verwendet man ein Gemisch aus gleichen Teilen Komposterde und Torf.\nErde / Substrat\n\nF\u00fcr die Kultur der Callisia verwendet man ein Gemisch aus gleichen Teilen Komposterde und Torf.\nUmtopfen\n\nDa die Pflanzen nach zwei bis drei Jahren ihr intensive Blattf\u00e4rbung verlieren, sollte man die Callisia rechtzeitig durch Kopfstecklinge verj\u00fcngen. Die Callisia-Fragans w\u00e4chst sehr z\u00fcgig und sollte im Fr\u00fchjahr in ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df umgetopft werden.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nDer N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf der Callisia ist gering bis m\u00e4\u00dfig. Die Callisia wird alle 14 Tage mit einem handels\u00fcblichen Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger in schwacher Konzentration ged\u00fcngt. Von November bis Februar reichen zwei D\u00fcngergaben f\u00fcr die Callisia vollkommen aus.\nKrankheiten & Pflanzensch\u00e4dlinge:\n\nThripse, Blattl\u00e4use, Schild- und Wolll\u00e4use k\u00f6nnen bei zu niedriger Luftfeuchtigkeit, zu starker Zugluft oder anderen Pflegefehlern an den Callisia auftreten.", "title": "Callisia, Sch\u00f6npolster, Commelinagew\u00e4chse", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T00:43:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7mPDgPbEayU", "description": "Should The Police Have Ignored This Law?\n\nhttp://fullist.co.uk/2014/11/90-year-old-pastor-arrested-faces-jail-time-feeding-homeless/\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/FullistSubscribe\n\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/fullistuk\nTWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/fullistuk\nWEBSITE: http://www.fullist.co.uk\n\nSend your videos: contact@fullist.co.uk\n\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad---\n\nFullist does not claim ownership of the third-party material used, explicitly used for news, criticism and debate.\n\nProduced and Protected under UK, USA Copyright Law and Youtube Fair Use Policy:\n\nCopyright P-01. 8.

The different themes for this IB art exhibition are Self-cautiousness, Identity and Social Beliefs which have been portrayed using different mediums and inspired by artists from English artist, Jenny Saville, German-born British Painter, Lucian Freud to a local Thai artist in Phuket, Jay-da Rodnit. \n\nThe international baccalaureate is a demanding programme especially in the art course. Each student has to produce a range of 12-18 pieces which will then be moderated by an internal and external examiner. Followed by a 45 minute oral exam with an external moderator to examine how well each student can express what they are trying to portray through their pieces. After this two year course, the three artists, Num, me Mathilde and Zac have finally reached their grand opening for the presentation of their pieces to the school and the community. Each of them have their own distinct style. Num's creations are about Identity and social and cultural beliefs. Her main media used in each piece is acrylic. My pieces are about Self-cautiousness and social beliefs with photography as my main media. Lastly, Zac's pieces are a portrayal of relationships with oil paints as his main media. (The exhibition is on view until 24th April 2009 at BIS). This is Mathilde, at British International School reporting for Andaman News.

The endless options of EDM have ever been the object of \u00d8rjan Nilsen's affection. Thrilled by diversity, he has spend months of time in the studio, trying to find the perfect blend of house, trance, progressive and everything else that tingles his open mind. The result, an amalgam of years of creativity, is \u00d8rjan's promising debut album, 'In My Opinion'.\n\nIndulged with music from an early age, he mastered the drums and keyboard at only 9 years old. At the age of 16, as he experienced his first crush on trance music and completely fell in love with rhythmic patterns and melodies, he got his first synthesizer. The Norwegian music lover, reigning from the cold, upper part of the country, soon learned about the magic of working on a pc and started experimenting with that extraordinary grey box. After some unofficial remixes and solo tracks, it was the release of 'Red Woods' in 2005 that turned out to be \u00d8rjan's breakthrough. Ever since, no dancefloor is safe to the sounds of the characteristic Norwegian. Summer-hit 'La Guitarra', hammered by the trance elite for months in a row, the rough 'Moving Mojave' and sensitive 'Lovers Lane', keeping up with the ever-throbbing heart of the club society, contagious 'So Long Radio', 'Mjuzik' and the strong and outstanding 'Go Fast!'. All original and different, yet distinctively riding the Nilsen sound.\n\nAfter months of hard work in the studio, \u00d8rjan Nilsen proudly presents 'In My Opinion'. Days of experimenting, blending and shaping now come together in an album that is, sounds and represents \u00d8rjan. \u00d8rjan:\"I can't describe it other than being me. The sound you're hearing is me, and how I feel and think. It seems like I have so many things that need to get to the surface, and I'm showing that through my music.\"\n\n15 jewels of tracks tell the colorful story of musical talent, touching you on the inside with a palette of melody, beats, synths and a whole lot of feeling to glue it together. Whether you're in the mood to party or simply feel like absorbing the album with the volume up at home, 'In My Opinion' will fit all sceneries. Free of parochialism and one-style-fits-all, but crossing boundaries and hitting the right spot at the right time, is what 'In My Opinion' is all about. \u00d8rjan:\"I just didn't follow any kind of recipe. I've merged so many styles together, made so many new things and I hope it reflects both the past and future, as well as the present.\"\n\n1 The Thunder (feat.

Bagian akhir sistem pencernaan adalah kolon atau usus besar yang bertugas menyerap cairan dan membentuk limbah padat (tinja) dan mengeluarkannya dari tubuh.\nRadang usus besar merupakan kondisi serius dan kronis yang dapat berakibat fatal pada kasus yang sangat parah. Radang usus besar adalah kondisi di mana satu atau beberapa bagian usus mengalami radang. Ukuran usus besar manusia dewasa memiliki panjang sekitar 5 kaki dan letaknya yang berliku-liku yang merupakan organ sebagai media tempat menyimpan dan menyerap sari pati makanan untuk tubuh\n\nJika radang atau luka hanya terjadi pada lapisan permukaan usus besar, disebut colitis. Jika di dubur disebut proctitis. Dan jika terjadi pada usus besar dan dubur, maka Anda disebut menderita colitis ulserative. Radang biasanya dimulai dari dubur dan menyebar ke usus besar, tapi tidak meluas sampai usus halus. Akibat yang Anda rasakan adalah diare.\n\nRadang usus menyebabkan sel-sel yang melapisi dinding usus mengelupas, terjadilah luka terbuka pada dinding usus (tukak) yang kemudian mengeluarkan lendir atau nanah. Pada kasus ini, diare sering disertai lendir, darah dan nanah.\nKetika peradangan menembus dinding usus, maka Anda disebut menderita penyakit Crohn. Penyakit ini selain menyerang usus besar juga menyerang usus halus atau bagian lain dari saluran pencernaan. Risikonya, terkena kanker usus besar (32%) karena penyakit ini menyebabkan sel-sel selaput lendir usus besar menjadi embrio kanker (disebut displasia).\n\nProses Terjadinya Radang Usus Besar\n\nProses radang usus dapat dimulai dimulai ketika terjadi sumbatan di muara saluran usus, misalnya karena tinja atau feses yang terperangkap dan mengeras. Hal ini menimbulkan suatu kondisi usus dapat pecah dan dapat menginfeksi rongga perut bagian dalam dan organnya.\nRadang usus besar sering terjadi karena sembelit (konstipasi), gelisah atau keguguran. Namun, penyebab utama terjadinya colitis adalah kurangnya zat-zat organik di dalam tubuh yang dapat membantu lancarnya fungsi usus besar.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n \nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. Placoderms are paraphyletic, and comprise several distinct outgroups or sister taxa to all living jawed vertebrates, which originated among their ranks. This is illustrated by a 419-million-year-old fossil, Entelognathus, from China, which is the only known placoderm with a type of bony jaw like that found in modern bony fishes. This includes a dentary bone, which is found in humans and other tetrapods,. The jaws in other placoderms were simplified and consisted of a single bone. Placoderms were also the first fish to develop pelvic fins, the precursor to hindlimbs in tetrapods, as well as true teeth. 380-million-year-old fossils of three other genera, Incistoscutum, Materpiscis and Austroptyctodus, represent the oldest known example of live birth.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nPlacoderm_anatomy.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi\n\nDunkleosteusSannoble.JPG from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi\n\nBothriolepis_panderi.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi\n\n266px-Dunkleosteus_BW.jpg from http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placodermi", "title": "All About - Placodermi", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T05:18:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ml9fTh5XwI", "description": "Facebook - http://facebook.com/tvbluesky\nShiko Live - http://blueskymusic.tv\nAty ku muzika buron nga shpirti", "title": "Gjyste Vulaj -  Ve\u00e7 nj\u00eb her\u00eb  me t'puth fort (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-26T19:58:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7mlY0bQ7RPQ", "description": "HG Stove Glass Cleaner is a foam cleaner that easily removes soot, grease and tar from glass windows in stoves and hearths.

I'm happy about that,\" Sherman said. \" I'm sure if our team knew it was going to come down to a play like that they would be pretty confident going into it.\"\n\nSherman stole the attention on Sunday, first by deflecting a pass intended for Crabtree in the corner of the end zone with less than a minute left, right into the arms of Seattle teammate Malcolm Smith to seal the Seahawks' 23-17 win.\nBut then came the antics and Sherman's words that revealed a deep dislike for Crabtree and satisfaction in Seattle knocking off its division rivals to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile Smith was celebrating the interception, Sherman exchanged words with Crabtree, got shoved in the face as a rebuttal then made a choking gesture toward the San Francisco bench that he said was intended for quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\nAsked about the incident afterward by Fox reporter Erin Andrews, Sherman lit up Twitter with a rant that began: \"I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you gonna get. Don't you ever talk about me!\"\n\nSherman didn't back down even after getting some time to collect his thoughts. He apologized to Andrews, then proceeded to call Crabtree \"mediocre,\" making sure to annunciate each syllable of the word.\n\n\"I was making sure everybody knew Crabtree was a mediocre receiver,\" Sherman said. \"And when you try the best corner in the game with a mediocre receiver that's what happens.\"\nIt was a fiery, emotional rant from Sherman, who celebrated his first conference title by racing around the field after Russell Wilson took the final knee, then leaping into the first row of seats in the south end zone to celebrate with fans.\n\n\"I know how passionate he is about the game of football. He said to me before the game it's going to come down to us making big plays. We've got to do it. Somehow we've got to find a way to make big plays,\" said teammate Doug Baldwin.\n\n\"(Sherman) has been doing it all season. He is arguably the best cornerback in the NFL. They were trying to stay away from him the whole game. Eventually they were going to have to go his way and eventually they did and they made a mistake.\"\nSherman was rarely targeted by San Francisco, with most of the throws going toward Sherman's teammate Byron Maxwell. But when Kaepernick had to make a throw in the final seconds, he decided to challenge the All-Pro.\n\nSherman stayed with Crabtree, leaped and batted the ball into the air with his left hand. That allowed Smith to run underneath and make the interception that clinched the victory. It was San Francisco's third turnover in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I knew if I tipped it high enough someone would get there,\" Sherman said.\n\nSherman then ran over to Crabtree and gave him a pat on the backside, then appeared to extend his arm for a handshake.\nInstead, Sherman got shoved in the face before picking up his personal foul as his celebration continued.\n\n\"Sherman made a good play. That's probably the only play he made all game,\" Crabtree said. \"I ain't getting into that, he knows what time it is. When we're on the field, he ain't doing nothin'. That's one play, you know what I'm saying? ...\nHe's a TV guy, I'm not a TV guy. I play ball.\"\n\nSherman said his issues with Crabtree go back to something that happened during the off-season. He would not go into detail about what happened.\n\"He said something personal face to face,\" Sherman said. \"He knows what he said and he knows I'm going to be tough on him the rest of his career.\"", "title": "EPIC RANT: Richard Sherman Blows Up, Screaming 'I'm the Best Corner' after Big Win", "publishedDate": "2014-01-20T14:23:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7mloLtIbmSQ", "description": "Hey all!

While it does not appear commonly in the chantey collections of other authors, we do actually know a traditional form of it, due to a recording of practicing whalers on Nevis and St. Kitts, made by Roger Abrahams in 1962.  Abrahams later published a notation of it in his 1974 text Deep the Water, Shallow the Shore.\n\nOne issue is that the Caribbean style of chantey singing, at least in the off-shore boat trade that is now known, seems to be different than the deepwater global sailors chanteys.  Still, Hugill learned so many of his chanteys from Caribbean chanteymen.  Did European and American sailors adapt ~imperfect~ imitations of the West Indian chanteys or were these chanteys merely shared repertoire, which each nationality performed with equal integrity in his respective style?  Most would assume the latter, however, it is still relevant to consider to what extent authors like Hugill (and indeed singers in the mainstream of chantey performance today) meant to record West Indian chanteys but were unable to do so to the best effect due to limitations of both notational finesse and culture.\n\nGiven this context, the version of Yankee John, Stormalong that Hugill gives is so different from the Nevis/St. Kitts whalers version that I had to treat it as its own thing, i.e. the Abrahams recording could not really be used to enhance it.  The lyrics Hugill gives\u2014admittedly probably fairly incidental\u2014are not particularly characteristic of West Indian chanteying.  (The line In a hard case Down Easter to Miramashee sounds particularly non-characteristic, though that may just be my own ignorance.)  So I took Hugills as the transformed Euro-American sailors form of this very Caribbean theme, and tried to performed it as such.\n\nAlso found in:\nSharp 1914 (\"Liza Lee\")\n\nSee the whole \"Shanties from the Seven Seas\" project, here: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=58B55DD66F22060C", "title": "Yankee John, Stormalong [80] (74)", "publishedDate": "2009-01-21T01:09:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7nBNPCxtxgE", "description": "Ozeri 4xrazor Pedometer REVIEW.

It measures between 10 and 15 KV just in the air, about a foot away from the top of the ladder. The meter tops out at 40KV, which is about a third of the way up the ladder. I estimate the maximum voltage at the top would be between 120 and 160KV, if the variac was set to 220VAC. (The variac, which is connected to the 12KV neon sign transformer, is turned up to about 100VAC, which means that the transformer is supplying the ladder with about 5KV at the base, less than half its full potential).\n\nOperating from a 12 KVAC (RMS) transformer, the no load voltage should be 12,000 * (square root [2]) * 9 = 152734 volts.\n\nThe second part of the video shows the ladder connected to a spark gap through a home-made 1000MegaOhm resistor (the large white tube). This was an attempt to measure the current output. I measured around 10microamps on the ammeter (not visible in the video), before my survival instincts convinced me to ramp it down...     \n\nSee http://jonathanhoward.org/ for more details.\n\nThe Cockcroft-Walton multiplier, was named after the two men who in 1932 used this circuit design to power their particle accelerator, performing the first artificial nuclear disintegration in history. John Douglas Cockcroft and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton used this voltage multiplier cascade for most of their research, which in 1951 won them the Nobel Prize in Physics for \"Transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles\". Less well known is the fact that the circuit was discovered much earlier, in 1919, by Heinrich Greinacher, a Swiss physicist. For this reason, this doubler cascade is sometimes also referred to as the Greinacher multiplier. - wikipedia", "title": "Kilovolt Power Supply", "publishedDate": "2009-02-26T10:09:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7nLcIcv9IeQ", "description": "Sub Acromion Decompression - Impingement", "title": "Shoulder - Sub Acromion Decompression - Impingement", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T12:04:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7nLnrkleR_c", "description": "PCMag's Will Greenwald explains how to connect your XBox or Playstation 3 controller to your computer.

What is DST What does it save.\nDaylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m 2013 March\n\nTrue Mirror Youtube Video Channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bestvideofunmoments\nTrue Mirror Google+\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/117871618959439209149\nOnline Promotion and Web Development : Finsoft IT Solutions\nhttp://www.finsofts.com/\nTrue Mirror Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/TrueMirrorVideo\nTrue Mirror Facebook Page\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/True-Mirror-Video-Channel/336256449809817\n\nWhen is daylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m 2013. local time in all but a few parts of the USA.\n\nThe bad news: You will still lose an hour this Sunday morning.\n\nThe good news: With each passing year, there is less and less need to worry about that \"don't forget to move your clocks forward an hour\" part.\n\nThe U.S. first officially passed daylight saving time with the Standard Time Act in 1918. Since then, daylight saving has been repealed, reinstated for World War II, and finally etched firmly into a comprehensive law with with the Uniform Time Act in 1966. Each state can decide whether or not to participate, but those that do must conform to the nationally directed timeframes.\n\nSince 2007, daylight saving time in the U.S. has run from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November.\n\nPresident George W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act into law in 2005, which extended the length of DST by four weeks. It now begins at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November -- except in Hawaii and Arizona, where they observe standard time year-round. With all that sunshine, they probably don't even care what time it is. (Parts of Indiana, by the way, resisted dst until 2006.)\n\nFor the record, it is indeed \"daylight saving time,\" not \"daylight saving's time,\" though the matter can be avoided entirely by sticking with dst. (In some parts of the world it's called \"summer time.\")\n\nThe time switch has mixed effects on people's health. Night owls tend to have more trouble than early birds, according to a Finnish study in 2008, but everyone's sleep patterns can be disrupted by the transition into or out of DST.

It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Mowgli Productions Pvt Ltd. \n\nWrite to us for licensing this footage on a broadcast format, for use in your production etc Email Us at : themowgliproductions@gmail.com", "title": "The Green Sea Turtle Chelonia Mydas", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T04:27:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7nvaH7MlnlE", "description": "LA PAISANA POLKA ALEMANA TRADICIONAL DEL VOLGA INTERPRETADA POR JUAN FURLAN EN ACORDEON", "title": "LA PAISANA ( POLKA ALEMANA )DEL VOLGA", "publishedDate": "2008-12-26T20:48:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7nx6s7CYjgY", "description": "", "title": "Irish tunes on tenor banjo.

Hot Tools curling irons are the perfect tool to take your from plain to fabulous in minutes. Make sure your hair is dry, and lightly spray a thermal protectant before using your Hot Tools curling iron. Set the temperature to the appropriate setting based on your hair type and allow the curling iron to heat up fully before styling. Hot Tools curling irons can create many different hair styles from tight spirals to romantic waves. Divide hair into 3 sections, secure with clips and leave the bottom section down. Take a half inch section of hair and place the hair between the flipper and the barrel. Place the iron in hair, and wrap up to the top of the head making sure that all the ends of the section are completely enclosed in the barrel. Leave in place for 5 to 8 seconds. Release the section and slide the iron out. After all sections are complete and hair is cooled run your fingers gently through it to separate the curls and add volume. Spray with your favorite finishing product and apply a smoothing serum to the ends of hair. \n\nTIPS FROM THE PROS: For a more natural look, alternate the direction of the curls to prevent them from clumping together. For tighter curls, use a smaller barrel size iron. For loose curls or waves, use a medium to large barrel size iron. Hot Tools curling irons can also be used without the flipper by wrapping the section of hair over the flipper and barrel.

Son animales ungulados nativos de zonas secas y des\u00e9rticas de Asia.\nNombre\nEl nombre \"camello\" proviene del hebreo gamal, que significa \"devolver\" o \"compensar\", ya que el camello hace generalmente lo que su amo le solicita.\nEspecies\nExisten dos especies de camellos: el bactriano (Camelus bactrianus), provisto de dos jorobas, y el dromedario (Camelus dromedarius), que posee una sola joroba. Ambas especies son rumiantes sin cuernos, sin hocico, con los orificios nasales formando aberturas oblicuas, el labio superior dividido y movible por separado y extensible, sin pezu\u00f1as (tienen dos dedos diferenciados), el abdomen elevado y patas largas y delgadas. Al contrario de la creencia popular, el camello almacena grasa en vez de agua en la joroba, que suele caer hacia un costado al encontrarse sin reservas.\nAlgo particular es que muy poca gente sabe que los camellos son originarios de Am\u00e9rica y migraron a Eurasia y \u00c1frica gracias a las glaciaciones, esto se comprueba mediante el amplio registro f\u00f3sil de camellos en Am\u00e9rica. El m\u00e1s antiguo f\u00f3sil de camello descubierto hasta la fecha fue hallado en Kansas,a mediados de la d\u00e9cada de los 30s.\nComportamiento\nPor lo general, los camellos tienen un car\u00e1cter pasivo. Pero, para su defensa, suelen utilizar las patadas e incluso su saliva por medio de expulsi\u00f3n desde su boca, produciendo una sensaci\u00f3n de ardor al entrar en contacto con los ojos.\nSe les emplea normalmente como animales de carga, aunque tambi\u00e9n se aprovecha su piel, leche y carne. Puede ingerir 180 litros de agua de una sola vez y avanzar sin volver a tomar agua por m\u00e1s de 10 d\u00edas. Las hembras daban leche para el viaje y su pelo se hilaba para hacer vestidos y sogas. Con la piel se confeccionan sandalias y cantimploras, y el esti\u00e9rcol era \u00fatil como combustible para cocinar alimentos por la falta de \u00e1rboles en el desierto. En el norte de \u00c1frica existen \"dromedarios danzantes\" y de competici\u00f3n que divierten al p\u00fablico durante la fiesta conocida como \"el d\u00eda del camello\". Tambi\u00e9n son empleados para transportar turistas por el desierto.\nGranjas de camellos\nDurante las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, los camellos han recuperado el reconocimiento por su potencial producci\u00f3n de comida en zonas \u00e1ridas y semi\u00e1ridas de Sud\u00e1n. Despu\u00e9s de haber sido destituidos por inecon\u00f3micos por el gobierno de Sud\u00e1n, su papel vital en el soporte de poblaciones humanas en algunas de las \u00e1reas m\u00e1s pobres y azotadas por la sequ\u00eda del mundo ha sido ahora reconocido (Hjort af Orn\u00e4s, 1988). La devastadora sequ\u00eda de \u00c1frica entre 1984 y 1985 demostr\u00f3 que la posesi\u00f3n de camellos pod\u00eda dar a los pastores una excelente oportunidad de sobrevivir. Mientras todos los reba\u00f1os de ovejas y cabras sucumb\u00edan a las \u00e1ridas condiciones, la poblaci\u00f3n de camellos sobrevivi\u00f3 relativamente ilesa. Por consiguiente, algunos grupos de pastores con profundas ra\u00edces en la ganader\u00eda, como los Samburu del norte de Kenia, empezaron a adquirir camellos (Sperling, 1987), un hecho que atrajo la atenci\u00f3n de agencias de desarrollo y organizaciones internacionales.\nUsos militares\nSe han hecho intentos de utilizar los camellos como caballer\u00eda y monturas de drag\u00f3n y como animales de carga en lugar de caballos o mulas. Los camellos han sido usados militarmente, sobre todo, por su habilidad para asustar caballos en registros cerrados, una cualidad famosamente usada por los aquem\u00e9nidos persas cuando luchaban contra Lidia. Adem\u00e1s, los persas sol\u00edan usar los camellos como trenes de avituallamiento para transportar armas y equipo. Los caballos aborrecen el olor de los camellos que est\u00e1n cerca, incluso haci\u00e9ndose dif\u00edciles de controlar. El ej\u00e9rcito de los Estados Unidos tuvo una unidad de camellos desplegada en California en el siglo XIX, y los establos de ladrillos todav\u00eda pueden verse en el arsenal de Benicia, ahora convertido en estudio de artistas y artesanos. Los camellos se han usado en guerras por toda \u00c1frica; hasta el Imperio Romano de Oriente us\u00f3 tropas auxiliares conocidas como Dromedarii, reclutadas en las provincias del desierto. Durante la Guerra Civil Americana, los camellos fueron usados en una etapa experimental, pero no lleg\u00f3 lejos.", "title": "Camellos(dos gibas)", "publishedDate": "2011-06-12T11:44:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7o0w_GuP9WM", "description": "The song title is only tentative, Tom tells us in the introduction to this performance at the Beachland Tavern in Cleveland, where Tom appeared with American War and Old Canes on Monday, October 19, 2009.", "title": "Tom Evanchuck--Brakeman", "publishedDate": "2009-10-24T04:42:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7o15_IN2i8Q", "description": "Download: http://solutionzip.com/downloads/stack-infix-to-postfix-cpp/\nWrite a program in which the driver simply calls a function\nnamed inToPostfix which reads an infix expression from\nstandard input and writes the equivalent postfix expression\nto standard output.

Mit einer Ausnahme handelt es sich bei allen diesen Substanzen um Metalle; einige von ihnen sind giftig, w\u00e4hrend andere selten oder nie in nat\u00fcrlichen Umgebungen vorkommen. \n.\n.\n Das Poison Control Center berichtete dar\u00fcber hinaus, wie bei jedem Kontakt mit gef\u00e4hrlichen Substanzen k\u00f6nnte ein l\u00e4ngerer Kontakt mit Barium das Immunsystem schw\u00e4chen.\nJetzt ist die Zeit des Leugnens und Abstreitens vorbei. Wissenschaftler diskutieren in aller Offenheit \u00fcber M\u00f6glichkeiten, die Sonneneinstrahlung durch ihre Geoengineering-Programme zu verringern und das Blau des Himmels durch ein dunstiges Wei\u00df zu ersetzen. Als Folge drohen weltweit D\u00fcrren und Hungersn\u00f6te. Viele Hinweise belegen, dass derartige Experimente schon seit geraumer Zeit in gro\u00dfem Umfang laufen. Selbst der britische Chefwissenschaftler von Greenpeace, Doug Parr, der zu den \u00fcberzeugten Verfechtern der These geh\u00f6rt, dass vor allem von Menschen zu verantwortende Prozesse f\u00fcr die globale Erw\u00e4rmung verantwortlich sind, bezeichnete diese Vorhaben als \u00bbhaarstr\u00e4ubend\u00ab und \u00bbgef\u00e4hrlich\u00ab.

Toyon is a prominent part of coastal sage scrub communities, but also occurs in chaparral and oak woodlands. It can tolerate frost up to -12 Celsius in places such as Northern Europe where it is grown as a garden plant. In this video the berries haven't ripened yet, but supposedly the red berries that persist well into the wintertime are part of the appeal of this plant to some landscape planners. Here in San Elijo Hills I found these toyon plants as part of the landscaping next to dirt trails in conjunction with the biggest coyote brushes I've ever seen. As I surmised many videos ago, many of these chaparral plants will grow much bigger than the claimed maximum sizes listed online if they are cared for by humans and given adequate space. Eventually these toyon plants will perhaps reach the size of small trees as this planned community ages. The Wikipedia entry states that toyon can grow up to 10 meters in height in shaded conditions, presumably because the soil in north-facing slopes or shaded gulleys can retain more moisture and provide for better growth conditions in the chaparral.\n\nIn the 1920s Los Angeles had a problem with people running into the hills or private land to collect toyon branches with berries on them to serve as Christmas decorations.", "title": "Toyon, Heteromeles arbutifolia, San Marcos, California", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T15:32:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7oFPxSQ3uqI", "description": "Tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8ks-0Eeys&feature=channel&list=UL\n\nAll rights belong to Audiomachine", "title": "Danuvius - Audiomachine (piano cover by Alopex Lagopus)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T12:25:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7oF_l8ZInS0", "description": "https://soundcloud.com/toluhaukat/tolu-j-sike-da-sinista-tullaan", "title": "Tolu J & Sike Da Sinista   Tullaan Sun Sielus Per\u00e4\u00e4n", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T06:42:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7oFlYn2EK0s", "description": "Hundreds of interpreters who worked with British and US troops in Afghanistan are desperately seeking asylum in the countries they helped during the war.

For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the na\u00efve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered. But Hellboy (Perlman) isn't about to stand idly by as the planet is purged by a demonic despot, and with a little help from his team at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, he may just be able to send our otherworldly overlords packing. Of course, Hellboy's pyrokinetic girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), is always willing to conjure up an inferno or two when things get desperate, aquatic Abe (Doug Jones) is prepared to dive headlong into any battle, and protoplasmic mystic Johann (voice of Thomas Kretschmann) proves an invaluable companion in times of inter-dimensional conflict. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear up for an all-out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds.\n\n\"hellboy 2 the golden army\",\"ron perlman\",\"doug jones\",\"selma blair\",\"guillermo del toro\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"comic books and superheroes\",fantasy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"lawrence gordon\",\"lloyd levin\",\"mike richardson\",\"chris symes\",\"john swallow\",\"mike mignola\",\"building videos\",liz,\"young hellboy\",\"abe sapien\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++357814,/m/04gv3y,/m/03hhd3,/m/01mqh5", "title": "Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (2/10) Movie CLIP - Burn 'Em All!

What did I tell you about asking questions? That's right; don't. \n\n\nHow To Play:\n\nRed Team: \nYour main objective is to collect a predefined number of pages. It's not that simple though! You need to avoid whatever creature(s) happen(s) to be following you. Once all pages are collected, if the map allows, your team will need to escape the to win. Winners get to beat the the blue team to death. Fun. \n\nBlue Team: \nYou are seated in a waiting area and told to wait your turn. When the next round starts, the plugin chooses the next set of players. These players are picked depending on how many queue points they have. \n\nYou aren't completely left out, though! To watch players as a ghost, use the /slghost command! You can ghost other users by pressing the taunt button. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nOfficial Servers:\n\nEurope: \nGlubbable's first server - 188.165.198.6:27026 \nGlubbable's second server - 188.165.198.6:27019 \n\nThe United States: \nLunar Republic Gaming- 198.12.122.131:27015 \n\n\n\nDescription taken from Slender Fortress Steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SlenderFortress\n\nGlubs Servers Steam Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GlubsServers\n\nMy Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlycreature7\n\nMy Slender Fortress Guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=262138997\n\n\nI do not own any music that was in this video, it all came from in-game, nor do i know the song names/origins.", "title": "TF2 | Slender Fortress (80) | Atomics | Five Nights at Freddy's Boss Quintet", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T22:34:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ocMAR2X_j0", "description": "", "title": "time lap ful hd", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T03:19:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7octIzJtqlk", "description": "Ronnie Wood hears how legendary guitarist and songwriter Steve Cropper wrote the parts for hits including Wilson Pickett's 'Midnight Hour' and Eddie Floyd's 'Knock On Wood'.

If the wire is slanted, it radiates waves, which have both horizontal and vertical qualities. \" (quoted from below website)\nLoop Antenna Notes - KL7JR\n\nRegards, \n\nDream Antenna Designs", "title": "Dream Catcher Full Wave Loop Antenna - Dream Antenna Designs", "publishedDate": "2011-12-19T05:28:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7oday_Fc-Gc", "description": "", "title": "Joan Baez - Here's to you, Nicola and Bart", "publishedDate": "2009-11-30T20:19:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7odcSwn-HdA", "description": "Mary King's Close in Edinburgh is one of the most haunted locations in the UK. \nIt has been open to the public for the last five years, and reveals a mysterious time capsule.", "title": "Mary Kings Ghost Fest, Edinburgh", "publishedDate": "2010-08-10T15:36:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7oeINJpbAFo", "description": "Get yours at SwimOutlet.com\nhttp://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/48967.htm\n\nThe Sand Hopper Short gives you Oakley technology in a versatile print, designed for men of all age groups who love the water.\n\nBasic Four-Way Stretch.\nQuick drying.\nStretch fly.\nSublimated plaid print boardshort.\nSide flap pocket with Velcro\u2122 closure.\nTie tab closure system.\nFront and pocket logo embroideries.\n21\" outseam.\nRegular fit.\n94% Polyester / 6% Spandex.\n\nhttp://www.SwimOutlet.com is the web's most popular swim shop!\n\nWhen shopping at http://www.SwimOutlet.com you can always expect the following:\n\n\u00b7 Low & Free Shipping\n\n\u00b7 No Hassle Returns and Free Exchange Shipping\n\n\u00b7 Fast Shipping\n\n\u00b7 Widest Selection\n\n\u00b7 100% Low Price Guarantee\n\u00b7 24/7 Customer Service", "title": "Oakley Men's Sand Hopper Boardshort | SwimOutlet.com", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T04:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7of3rz37kxo", "description": "video uploaded from my mobile phone", "title": "Ina Amah Lasahon-by Raquel Alfante", "publishedDate": "2012-07-13T23:17:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7of4D0bzPYk", "description": "Joining Tim in the studio this morning are Federal Member for Perth Alannah MacTiernan and state Liberal MP Peter Katsambanis.

Sheep were kept for their milk, meat and especially their wool. Over the next millennia, sheep and shepherding spread throughout Eurasia. Henri Fleisch tentatively suggested the Shepherd Neolithic industry of Lebanon may date to the Epipaleolithic and that it may have been used by one of the first cultures of nomadic shepherds in the Beqaa valley.[1][2]\nSome sheep were integrated in the family farm along with other animals such as chickens and pigs. To maintain a large flock, however, the sheep must be able to move from pasture to pasture; this required the development of an occupation separate from that of the farmer. The duty of shepherds was to keep their flock intact and protect it from wolves and other predators. The shepherd was also to supervise the migration of the flock and ensured they made it to market areas in time for shearing. In ancient times shepherds also commonly milked their sheep, and made cheese from this milk; only some shepherds still do this today.\nIn many societies, shepherds were an important part of the economy. Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others. Shepherds also lived apart from society, being largely nomadic. It was mainly a job of solitary males without children, and new shepherds thus needed to be recruited externally. Shepherds were most often the younger sons of farming peasants who did not inherit any land. Still in other societies, each family would have a family member to shepherd its flock, often a child, youth or an elder who couldn't help much with harder work; these shepherds were fully integrated in society.\nShepherds would normally work in groups either looking after one large flock, or each bringing their own and merging their responsibilities. They would live in small cabins, often shared with their sheep and would buy food from local communities. Less often shepherds lived in covered wagons that travelled with their flocks.\nShepherding developed only in certain areas. In the lowlands and river valleys, it was far more efficient to grow grain and cereals than to allow sheep to graze, thus the raising of sheep was confined to rugged and mountainous areas.
