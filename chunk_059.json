Adapting the amorally enigmatic and violent Man With No Name persona from his films with Sergio Leone, Eastwood's second film as director begins as his drifter emerges from that heat haze and rides into the odd lakefront settlement of Lago. Lago's residents are not particularly friendly, but once the Stranger shows his skills as a gunfighter, they beg him to defend them against a group of outlaws (led by Eastwood regular Geoffrey Lewis) who have a score to settle with the town. He agrees to train them in self-defense, but Mordecai and innkeeper's wife Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom) soon suspect that the Stranger has another, more personal agenda. By the time the Stranger makes the corrupt community paint their town red and re-name it \"Hell,\" it is clear that he is not just another gunslinger. With its fragmented flashbacks and bizarre, austere locations, High Plains Drifter's stylistic eccentricity lends an air of unsettling eeriness to its revenge story, adding an uncanny slant to Eastwood's antiheroic westerner. Seminal western hero John Wayne was so offended by Eastwood's harshly revisionist view of a frontier town that he wrote to Eastwood, objecting that this was not what the spirit of the West was all about. Eastwood's audience, however, was not so put off, and an exhibitors' poll named Eastwood a top box-office draw for 1973.\n\n\"high plains drifter\",\"high plains drifter clip\",\"high plains drifter part 1\",\"high plains drifter trailer\",\"william oconnell\",\"scott walker\",\"clint eastwood\",\"gun videos\",\"pistol videos\",\"shaving cream videos\",\"classic action adventure\",westerns,\"classic country western\",classics,\"jennings lang\",\"aggression videos\",\"conflict videos\",\"life and death videos\",\"violence videos\",\"barber shop videos\",\"old west videos\",\"the stranger\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++22387,/m/0bwh6,/m/05sqg8q", "title": "High Plains Drifter (1/8) Movie CLIP - A Shave and a Shootout (1973) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T07:36:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fc41iDJU_Q", "description": "*No copyrights infringement intended*\n\u2726 Please Support Tohoshinki by buying the Original Single\n\u2726 toho-jp.net/ \n\u2726 You can buy it from : Amazon.jp , cdjapan.co.jp , hmv.co.jp \n(all these sites have english interface and they are counted into Oricon Chart!)\n\u2726 https://twitter.com/YODMANOODlllll", "title": "[PV] \u6771\u65b9\u795e\u8d77\u300cTime Works Wonders\u300d- Baby Don't Cry", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T06:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fcgE89cPWc", "description": "Monday, April 6th, 2010  Windsor, Ontario, Canada.\n\nA two vehicle collision occurred between a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan and a fuel transport truck at about 9:37pm Monday evening at the intersection of Ojibway Parkway and Weaver Road (in front of the Windsor Raceway).

Nevertheless, because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, and the participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery, it has adopted loanwords from all over the world.\nVery few Portuguese words can be traced to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal, which included the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, briefly present, also left some scarce traces. Some notable examples are ab\u00f3bora \"pumpkin\" and bezerro \"year-old calf\", from the nearby Celtiberian language (probably through the Celtici); cerveja \"beer\", from Celtic; through Latin \"cervisia.\"\nIn the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania) was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed only a few words to the lexicon, mostly related to warfare\u2014such as espora \"spur\", estaca \"stake\", and guerra \"war\", from Gothic *spa\u00fara, *stakka, and *wirro, respectively. The influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such has Ermesinde, Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic \"sinths\" (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix re comes from Germanic \"reths\" (council).\nBetween the 9th and 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired about 900 words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia. They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a(l)-, and include many common words such as aldeia \"village\" from \u0627\u0644\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0629 al\u1e0dai`a (or from Edictum Rothari: aldii, aldias),[80] alface \"lettuce\" from \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633 alkhass, armaz\u00e9m \"warehouse\" from \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646 almakhzan, and azeite \"olive oil\" from \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a azzait. From Arabic came also the grammatically peculiar word oxal\u00e1 \u0625\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \"hopefully\". The Mozambican currency name metical was derived from the word \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 mitq\u0101l, a unit of weight. The word Mozambique itself is from the Arabic name of sultan Mu\u00e7a Alebique (Musa Alibiki).\nStarting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, catana \"cutlass\" from Japanese katana and ch\u00e1 \"tea\" from Chinese ch\u00e1.\nFrom South America came batata \"potato\", from Taino; anan\u00e1s and abacaxi, from Tupi--Guarani nan\u00e1 and Tupi ib\u00e1 cati, respectively (two species of pineapple), and tucano \"toucan\" from Guarani tucan.\n\nPortuguese language schools\nPortuguese language software\nPortuguese language training\nPortuguese lesson\nPortuguese lessons\nPortuguese names\nPortuguese online\nPortuguese phrases\nPortuguese school\nPortuguese software\nPortuguese translate\nPortuguese translation\nPortuguese translations\nPortuguese translator\nPortuguese tutor\nPortuguese vocabulary\nPortuguese words\nPortuguese writing\nlearn basic Portuguese\nlearn how to speak Portuguese\nlearn Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese\nstudy Portuguese language\nteach me Portuguese", "title": "Portuguese lessons for students of all ages", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T09:38:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fhkLw4bxVM", "description": "", "title": "The wank prank", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T23:09:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fi-zfPBCQ8", "description": "NA SPRZEDA\u017b\nWa\u0142ach Santana Highbrow, ur. 06.2011r.\nod klaczy Sal Highbrow, rasy AQH\npo ogierze Sylwan, czystej krwi arabskiej oo\n\nkontakt - j.suliga93@gmail.com", "title": "NA SPRZEDA\u017b Santana Highbrow", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T20:24:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fi0m8ei_B4", "description": "Various train and subway door closing annouceemnts, beeps, and chimes\nfrom around the New York City, New Jersey, Boston, Denver, San\nFrancisco, San Diego, Portland OR, Seattle, Vancouver BC, London, and Tokyo", "title": "Train & Subway Door Closing Annoucements, Beeps, & Chimes", "publishedDate": "2013-12-30T20:00:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fiDtX_VQZg", "description": "A Cessna 172S doing flight training over Morgan Hill.", "title": "Cessna stall recovery training over Santa Clara county", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T03:27:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fiRqCw6xmc", "description": "In poor wet ground, one strategy that some plants have adopted in order to augment their nutrient intake is to catch and digest insects.

The current RV market has evolved very little, still producing big rectangular boxes with terrible gas mileage. SunRay's alternative is a sleek, curvaceous, lightweight body that cuts easily through the wind. A solar array on top of the full-scale vehicle will charge the battery banks that power the electric motor. A diesel generator will be used for backup power, and can be modified to run on vegetable oil.  This diesel-electric configuration has long been utilized to power trains and ships because of its greater efficiency and power.

M\u00e9dicamente se conoce como Herpes simple o HSV1.\n\nEl HSV1 se manifiesta como ampollas de fiebre alrededor de la boca, en los labios y dentro de ella normalmente.\n\nEl HSV2 se conoce como Herpes Genital. Es una enfermedad de transmisi\u00f3n sexual y afecta a las personas en su \u00e1rea genital. Sin embargo, no se limita exclusivamente a esa zona, tambi\u00e9n puede adoptar variaciones y afectar cualquier otra zona del cuerpo.\n\nEl HSV1 es m\u00e1s com\u00fan que el HSV2 en una proporci\u00f3n del 80% al 20% y la raz\u00f3n es simple. El HSV1 se puede contraer de distintas formas mientras que el Herpes Genital se transmite casi siempre durante las relaciones sexuales.\n\nHay quienes tienen Herpes Simple y Herpes Genital adem\u00e1s de Herpes Zoster como resultado de m\u00faltiples contagios. El contagio se produce por contacto directo en todos los tipos.\n\nEs importante que sepa que el Virus del Herpes no se transmite a trav\u00e9s de la sangre, tampoco lo puedes transmitir a tu generaci\u00f3n cong\u00e9nitamente. \n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los s\u00edntomas del HSV1 y HSV2 y Herpes Zoster?\n\nCon la aparici\u00f3n de la fiebre labial para el caso del Herpes oral, las enc\u00edas se enrojecen y se inflaman y pueden aparecerte unas sombras de color blanco sobre la lengua. Adem\u00e1s de estos s\u00edntomas puedes experimentar fiebre, dolores musculares, malestar general parecido al de una gripe. La gravedad de los s\u00edntomas va a depender siempre de tu capacidad para responder al virus. \n\nLos s\u00edntomas para el HSV2 (Herpes genital) es muy similar al HSV1, ocasionando igualmente fiebre, dolor de cabeza, malestar general, sensaci\u00f3n de gripe, dolor en la ingle, picaz\u00f3n y escozor en el \u00e1rea afectada, y por supuesto ampollas en el caso de los hombres en \u00e1rea del pene y en de las mujeres las ampollas aparecen alrededor de la vagina, o incluso dentro del cuello uterino y en el ano tambi\u00e9n para ambos casos, no siendo raro que las ampollas se desarrollen en los mulos y en las nalgas.\n\nEs cierto que el Herpes puede resultarte muy molesto f\u00edsicamente, ocasionarte cambios repentinos de \u00e1nimo y mermar la confianza que tienes en tu cuerpo, adem\u00e1s de ser realmente desesperante. Incluso en base a mi experiencia padeciendo Herpes y luego de conocer la historia de muchas personas puede llegar a acabar con tu tranquilidad y tu autoestima. Quiz\u00e1 tu Herpes sea tan molesto y desesperante como el de otros o puede que no lo sea, lo cierto es que ahora es posible que acabes con los brotes y sigas llevando tu vida tranquila y saludablemente.\n\nSi quiere eliminar definitivamente cualquier tipo de herpes de una forma natural y poder as\u00ed llevar una vida plena y tranquila visite el siguiente enlace: http://bit.ly/curaelherpes\n\nherpes tratamientos \ntratamientos herpes \ntratamientos de herpes \nherpes remedios \nherpes genitales tratamiento \nherpes vaginal tratamiento  \nherpes remedios caseros  \nherpes genital cura \nherpes curas \ncuracion de herpes  \ntratamiento herpes\ntratamiento del herpes genital\ntratamiento del herpes zoster\ntratamiento del herpes simple\ntratamiento del herpes oral \nherpes tratamiento\nherpes tratamiento natural\ncura del herpes \ncura del herpes genital\ncura del herpes labial  \ncura del herpes zoster  \ncura del herpes simple \nremedios herpes \ncurar herpes\ncomo curar el herpes\nherpes curar\ncurar un herpes\ncomo curar un herpes \ntratamiento para herpes\ntratamiento herpes genital\nherpes genital tratamiento\ntratamiento herpes genitales\ntratamiento herpes vaginal\nremedios herpes labial\nherpes labial remedios\nremedios caseros herpes\ncura herpes genital\nherpes labial cura\ncura para el herpes\ntratamiento herpes zoster\ntratamiento natural herpes\nherpes medicina natural\nmedicina natural herpes", "title": "Como eliminar herpes - Cure Su Herpes De Forma Natural", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T16:26:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2fwNT4p6qsg", "description": "This video will state \" i don't know how it happened\" ..

They are dead wrong they can and will if steps are not taken.. On mine after inspection I had over tightened the electrode to the point it actually bent.. This cracked the device and led to water separating a piece of it..  \n\nSummary is this.. Check the current torque of the installed electrode before removing initially or monitor closely when installing with stingray to ensure the electrode is staying tight but not bending...

Director Bruno Monsaingeon, himself a concert violinist, first heard Markov during a recital in New York entirely devoted to the Caprices and was left utterly dumbfounded. He says of that concert, \"the technical difficulties, as if naturally overcome, had been replaced by an incandescent musical imagination which made the Paganini Caprices a thrilling experience, far removed from the school-masterly and cautious approach of most violinists.\" Sir Yehudi Menuhin says \"Alexander Markov will certainly leave his mark on the music-lovers of the world and in the annals of the violin virtuosi of our day. He is without doubt, one of the most brilliant and musical of violinists.\" Mstislav Rostropovich says: \"Once I managed to hear his performance of the 24 Paganini Caprices on TV I am certain that he is one of the most interesting young violinists of his generation in the entire world.\"", "title": "Paganini - Caprice no.15, Alexander Markov, violin [HD]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T04:42:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2g-YDhgXzm4", "description": "http://www.pst-recovery.org/after-format.html - Watch this video to know how to recover lost Outlook PST files after formatting your Windows system. \n\nWe all know that PST file is present on the root directory where OS is installed, & can be lost due to formatting.\nYou can however easily get back deleted/lost PST file using the simple process which I am going to show you here.\n\nAfter following the recovery steps, you will get your deleted or lost PST file on the selected location.

It ate small mammals and carrion. It is thought[who?] that the bird grasped its prey with its beak and smashed it to the ground repeatedly like its modern relatives, the Seriemas. It had an enormous skull up to sixty centimeters long, armed with a powerful, hook-tipped beak. The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a bird of prey.

The leaf margin of Broadleaf Plantain is entire, or unevenly toothed. The flower stalks, are erect, long, slender, densely-flowered spikes. Each tiny flower is brownish and bell-shaped with four stamens and purple anthers. Flowers bloom most of the summer. The fruit is a two-celled capsule and containing four to sixteen seeds. Gather young edible Broadleaf Plantain leaves in spring. Gather Plantain after flower spike forms, dry for later herb use.  The young leaves of the Broadleaf Plantain plant are edible as a raw salad or cooked as spinach.  Broadleaf Plantain contains Acubin which is reported to be a powerful anti-toxin. The leaves and the seed are medicinal used as an antibacterial, antidote, astringent, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antitussive, cardiac, demulcent, diuretic, expectorant, haemostatic, laxative, ophthalmic, poultice, refrigerant, and vermifuge. Medical evidence exists to confirm uses as an alternative medicine for asthma, emphysema, bladder problems, bronchitis, fever, hypertension, rheumatism and blood sugar control.  \n\nFor the most current and detailed information on this plant, please visit our FREE Online Guide to Wild Edible & Medicinal Plants at  http://www.luminearth.com/luminearthsguide/ .\n\nDisclaimer: The statements in these videos are for educational purposes only and have not been evaluated by or sanctioned by the FDA.

The local landmark also was home for the world famous Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.\n\n\"It was much more emotional than I expected,\" said Pam Seal, a cheerleader in 1975. She decided only Saturday to drive from the suburb of North Mesquite to watch. \"I'm so glad that I had my family out there to hold my hand through it. I didn't think I would be that much of a basket case about it. It was like saying goodbye to an old friend.\"\n\nJerry Jones bought the Cowboys and the stadium lease for $160 million in 1989. The night he agreed to the deal, he went to the stadium, laid on the 50-yard-line and looked up through the roof. Driving by before dawn Sunday, he said he got a lump in his throat. The blast itself turned out to be emotional, \"more so than I thought it would be.\"\n\nHis daughter and granddaughter both cried.\n\nHundreds of people arrived Saturday and stayed up all night for \"final tailgate\" parties before the implosion scheduled for 7 a.m. Along with the more than 20,000 assembled at official locations, people watched from hotels and office buildings as far as 10 miles away in downtown Dallas. Many former Cowboys players were among those taking a last look.\n\nThe event was surrounded by hoopla befitting the glitzy image of a club that bills itself as \"America's Team.\" Local television stations carried the implosion live, and ESPN's Chris Berman served as the master of ceremonies.\n\nWhen Casey Rogers pushed the button, white light flashed in the stadium's interior and there was a rumbling that sounded like a drumbeat. Then the ground shook and a cloud of smoke went up as the building dropped within seconds.\n\n\"Awesome!\" said Casey, who was still wearing his blue construction helmet a few minutes later. \"It was better than I thought it would be.\"\n\nThe only glitch created a cool image: Three buttressing pillars leaned but didn't fall.\n\n\"Now we've got Stonehenge,\" joked Irving mayor Herbert Gears.\n\nThe Cowboys moved to the new $1.2 billion Cowboys Stadium in nearby Arlington after the 2008 season. With the new stadium and others in the area -- including the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, where the Cowboys played from 1960 to October 1971 -- Irving officials decided they needed the land more than the building and opted to demolish the stadium.\n\nThe state already has a 10-year lease to use the property as a staging area for a highway construction project.\n\nOver 38 seasons, the Cowboys won 213 of the 313 regular-season and postseason games they played at Texas Stadium. Many Americans can't remember a Thanksgiving that didn't include watching the Cowboys play there.\n\nHall of Famers Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman played there, and Emmitt Smith established himself as the NFL's career rushing leader. Coach Tom Landry set such a high standard a statue of him was erected outside the building.\n\nThe stadium also played a role in popular culture.\n\nIt was the setting for \"Mean\" Joe Greene's memorable commercial in which he throws his Pittsburgh Steelers jersey to a fan who gives him a Coke (\"Hey kid, catch\") and the movie \"Any Given Sunday.\" Billy Graham opened the place with a 10-day Crusade, and country music star Garth Brooks held three nights of sold-out shows during which he flew over the crowd. There also were wrestling events, monster truck shows and motocross races.\n\nThe Cowboys and their stadium also led changes in the business side of sports, introducing personal seat licenses and making luxury suites popular. In the 1990s, Jones exploited an NFL revenue-sharing loophole by signing sponsorships for the stadium instead of the team.\n\nStill, the enduring image of Texas Stadium will be an overhead image of a Cowboys game, shot through the hole in the roof and showing the men in the shiny silver helmets with the blue star cheered on by beautiful cheerleaders.\n\n\"Texas Stadium will never become tarnished, neglected or dishonored, but always remembered, revered and respected, a memory that will be cherished, a place forever honored by all of us who were there,\" said Alicia Landry, the coach's widow, at a Friday farewell event. \"It was a special time and a special place, for the team and for the fans, to be part of our memories forever.\"", "title": "Texas Stadium Demolition", "publishedDate": "2010-04-11T21:01:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gInfyRRQAw", "description": "Today on TMZ Takeout:\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio's crotch attacked: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CytRkg5EUuE\n\nPeter Pilotto Meets Target: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzzVniei4kY\n\nCarrie Underwood at Rebecca Minkhoff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOyEUR2g7a8\n\nYoko Ono Or A Whale Mating?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixBwNNAlgDo\n\nBurt Jenner Goes OFF On Paps Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roYjwY5QJB0\n\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwlCee8pGiE\n\nSarah Silverman or Kate Beckinsale, Who's Hotter?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GQ25Hz6-0k", "title": "TMZ Takeout: Leo DiCaprio's Crotch, Sarah Silverman, and Fashion Week", "publishedDate": "2014-02-08T01:23:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gIwNIcFXgI", "description": "Este video se subi\ufffd de un tel\ufffdfono Android.", "title": "Buen mallon", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T21:13:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gJ4b6ITfMs", "description": "For months and months, police and the media have grossly misrepresented just how far Mike Brown fled from Darren Wilson as being just 35 feet.

They have a tendency to aggregate and are difficult to dispel. They are capable of carrying over 100 pathogens, such as those causing typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis, bacillary dysentery, tuberculosis, anthrax, ophthalmia, and parasitic worms. Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides.\n\nHouse flies feed on liquid or semiliquid substances beside solid material which has been softened by saliva or vomit. Because of their high intake of food, they deposit feces constantly, one of the factors that makes the insect a dangerous carrier of pathogens. Although they are domestic flies, usually confined to the human habitations, they can fly for several miles from the breeding place. They are active only in daytime, and rest at night, e.g., at the corners of rooms, ceiling hangings, cellars, and barns, where they can survive the coldest winters by hibernation, and when spring arrives, adult flies are seen only a few days after the first thaw. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housefly\n\nUnfortunately handheld, with such a macro and a minuscule depth of field the video is shaky and not always on focus.

The moment Jennifer's perfect moment, and dress, comes undone\n\nBut when her name was read out to recognise her role in Silver Linings Playbook, disaster struck.\nShooting up from her chair and hugging people around her, the Hunger Games star did not notice someone had put the leg of their chair down on her expensive Christian Dior gown.\nKeen to get on stage, the actress attempted to run off tearing her dress almost completely around at the tops of her thighs, which were left totally exposed.\n\nThe cast members of Breaking Bad turned around shocked as the stricken star realised at their table she was in trouble.\nFellow actresses Nicole Kidman and Marion Cotillard certainly felt the young woman's pain, and were caught on camera reacting to the dress' tearing.\nSo shocked was the French actress that her eyes popped open.\n\n\nLike a professional, Jennifer quickly pushed the ripped section of dress under the gown's existing tuck and strode towards the stage.\nOnce there, the Winter's Bone star once again narrowly missed showing off more than she planned to as the dress slipped apart.\n\nHolding the frock together a breathless - either from her pneumonia or shock - Lawrence accepted her best actress award.\nThe 22-year-old thanked her co-stars, her family and mega producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nPoor Jennifer had thought her illness was going to be the hardest part of the night.\nThe 22-year-old was so ill that on the night before the SAGs she was forced to miss the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards on Saturday.\nHowever, she managed to leave her sick bed and look amazing doing it for Sunday's awards.\nWith red lips and her hair swept to one side the Hunger Games star shone in the now infamous navy Christian Dior Haute Couture dress, Chopard jewels - which included a 38-carat diamond necklace and emerald-cut 6-carat diamond studs and a diamond ring, Roger Vivier clutch, and Jimmy Choo shoes.\n\nJennifer happily joked about being sick and infectious telling Giuliana Rancic during E!'s live pre-show she had 'walking pneumonia'.\n'Everyone is scared of me, I'm like, \"I'm fine,\"' she joked.\n'I had walking pneumonia, and it is highly contagious.'\nJennifer's Silver Linings colleagues have been very worried about their star.", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence rips her dress", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T12:21:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gUek5faia8", "description": "Show: Voices Of Change\n\nContributor: Ali Khan\n\nTopic: Inqilaab chahye!\n\nDescription: Revolution!

Kitman Ho, Arnon Milchan, Joseph P. Reidy, Oliver Stone, Clayton Townsend\nScreenwriter: Oliver Stone, Zachary Sklar, Jim Garrison, Jim Marrs\nFilm Description: The November 22, 1963, assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy shocked the nation and the world. The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizeable publishing mini-industry ever since. In making this movie, director Oliver Stone had his pick of supposed or real investigative flaws to draw from and has constructed what some reviewers felt was one of the most compelling (and controversial) political detective thrillers ever to emerge from American cinema. Long before filming was completed, Stone was fending off heated accusations of artistic and historical irresponsibility, and these only intensified after the film was released. In the story, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald (Gary Oldman), and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson (the next president), the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society, focusing on the shady activities of local businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again. This movie won two of the many Academy Awards for which it was nominated: one for Best Photography (Robert Richardson) and the other for Editing (Joe Hutshing).\n\njfk,\"jfk clip\",\"jfk assassination tape\",\"jfk assassination\",\"kevin costner\",\"jay o sanders\",\"john f kennedy\",\"jacqueline kennedy\",\"john connally\",\"nellie connally\",\"car videos\",\"rifle videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",biography,drama,\"period pieces\",\"political dramas\",\"arnon milchan\",\"clayton townsend\",\"joseph p reidy\",\"oliver stone\",\"a kitman ho\",\"deception videos\",\"discovery videos\",\"building videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++25653,/m/0127m7,/m/0271cm0,/m/0h6mq,/m/0d3k14", "title": "JFK (2/7) Movie CLIP - Crossfire in Daley Plaza (1991) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T02:48:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gahYeYv3yw", "description": "Preview of the upcoming album\nTrophoblast - Better Than Black Cock\nRelease Date: 12/13", "title": "Trophoblast - Mongoloid Dickhead / Retarded Scumbag", "publishedDate": "2012-12-08T04:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gark7b5Fl8", "description": "How to avoid child hyperthermia deaths.", "title": "Avoiding Child Hyperthermia Deaths", "publishedDate": "2008-06-05T19:44:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gbCBsABGQI", "description": "An explanation of currency hedging in money markets by a U.S. importer", "title": "Money Market Hedging of Payables", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T14:04:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gboGj-8Hbw", "description": "Pauperization in Palestinian Territories is constantly worsening since 2000.

For Tic-Toc, you have to be really fast in order to get a good score. Here, you'll get a good score almost every single time. Plus, the potential is even higher. Every time a P gem is matched, a horizontal column is cleared and a 3x3 explosion will occur. So, if you have P's on every row, you can potentially nuke the entire board. The spawn rate of the P gems is pretty consistent too. You'll also get a P gem every time you make a white flame gem.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "tiny man eats a living octopus in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:46:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2grTdXQLyrA", "description": "\u25ba Shindy \u201eFBGM\" (2014)\n\u25ba Standart http://www.smarturl.it/FBGM_Standart\n\u25ba Deluxe http://www.smarturl.it/FBGM_Deluxe", "title": "Shindy - No Joke feat.

Lacouture, MD, dermatologist, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explains the challenges that need to be overcome to improve communication between oncologists and dermatologists.\n\nLacouture says that one of the major challenges stems from an overall lack of dermatologists. As a result, only 8% of patients who develop a dermatologic side effect will actually see a dermatologist during therapy.\n\nThe timing of communication is important as oncologists need to quickly judge whether or not to continue with therapy. At the initial referral to a dermatologist, the oncologist needs to provide information about duration of treatment and type of therapy. This can be used to more accurately determine the cause of the adverse event.\n\nDermatologists and oncologists have different systems for grading side effects in patients. To provide an accurate classification of adverse events, dermatologists must be aware of the language and terminology used by oncologists.\n\nFor more resources visit: http://onclive.com/", "title": "Dr. Lacouture on Dermatologist-Oncologist Communication", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T17:10:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2gxLJcaN86k", "description": "1986 AE86 Trueno hatchback imported into the U.S. under the 25 year exemption up for sale in California.

Press Corps react to Janet Yellen's explanation of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. \n\nThe Federal Reserve officially got it's \"dual mandate\" of stable prices and full employment, in the Humphrey-Hawkins Law of 1978. \n\nThe Fed has actually been interfering with the price system, and not letting prices fall, since the 1920's. Inflation from The Fed, kept prices rising throughout the 1920's. \n\n\"Suffice it to say here that the stability of prices in the 1920's was the result of monetary inflation, offset by increased productivity which lowered production costs and increased the supply of goods.\" - Murray Rothbard, in \"America's Great Depression\" \n\nSo The Fed increased the cost of living, and the inflation helped cause the stock market bubble, the Crash of 1929, and the Great Depression. \n\nIn the 1920's The Fed was also working against the American people, by inflating the American dollar, to help England by stabilizing the price of the English pound. \n\nHerbert Hoover loved price stability, even as it trashed the economy. \n\nJohn Maynard Keynes said inflation would cure unemployment, by increasing the cost of living, to reducing real wages. The stagflation of the 1970's and 1980's, proved that inflation doesn't cure unemployment. It still doesn't. \n\n\"By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.\" - John Maynard Keynes \n\nThat's what The Fed does.\n\nMade with Anime Studio Pro 8, and Vegas Movie Studio 10 \n\n---\n\n1) The Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate \nhttp://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/our_dual_mandate.cfm\n[pics of fed reserve assets and liabilities] \n\n2) Index of The General Price Level for United States (1860 to 1939)\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M04051USM324NNBR\n\n3) If You Want To Know The Real Rate Of Inflation, Don't Bother With The CPI 2-3-14\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/perianneboring/2014/02/03/if-you-want-to-know-the-real-rate-of-inflation-dont-bother-with-the-cpi/\n\n4) Alternate Inflation Charts \nhttp://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts \n\n5) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Graph\nhttp://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdp_glance.htm \n\n6) Andrew Huszar: Confessions of a Quantitative Easer \nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303763804579183680751473884\n\"We went on a bond-buying spree that was supposed to help Main Street.

Skin tags look like tiny bits of \"hanging\" skin and typically occur in sites where clothing rubs against the skin or where there is skin-to-skin friction, such as the underarms, neck, upper chest, and groin area.\nSkin tags are not present at birth and their frequency increases with age. Studies have shown a genetic predisposition to the development of skin tags. Therefore, skin tags can run in families.\nIn this video we demonstrate how to use the Skin Resurfacer\u2122 to treat small skin tags under the arm using the process of electrocautery to desiccate the skin tag with the help of the heat conduction, leaving a tiny brown crust or scab that will eventually slough off, leaving no sign it was ever there. Total time of treatment is generally a few seconds per growth.\nNOTE: We caution all technicians not to \"cut\" or \"remove\" skin tags. This could be considered a medical treatment and is not within the scope of your practitioner's license.

Sometimes swelling or itching can accompany the pain of this injury. These symptoms are due to irritation or damage to the plantar fascia, a tissue that is designed to protect other tissues in your foot.\n\nThe Causes of Plantar Fasciitis\n\nPlantar Fasciitis can be the result of several different conditions. Some of the more common include standing for long periods of time, poor running form, ill-fitting shoes, over-pronation of the foot, poor arch support and misalignment of the foot when walking. Obesity can place extra stress loads on the plantar fascia, and in this instance losing weight can help the condition considerably. \nSymptoms\n\nMost people start to notice pain at the bottom of the foot, especially when they first get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes this pain subsides throughout the day, but in many cases the pain is fairly constant.\n\nIn addition, Plantar Fasciitis symptoms may include:\n\nSwelling\nTenderness\nRedness\nItching\n\nTreatment Options\n\nTreating Plantar Fasciitis symptoms is dependent on a number of factors. First, it's important to identify the root cause of the condition and address it. For some, this may be fairly obvious. For example, if you have gained weight recently, then this may be the culprit. In some cases, orthotic shoes may provide some relief from maligned feet.\n\nR.I.C.E. is an acronym that stands for Rest, Icepack application, Compression and Elevation. This is the first management step for Plantar Fasciitis and can be performed at home. If pain is particularly acute when you exercise, then you should rest and avoid walking or working out until the pain subsides.\n\nAnother effective treatment option for Plantar Fasciitis is stretching. This might involve stretching the plantar fascia itself or the calf muscle as well. Calf stretches have been medically proven to help patients with Plantar Fasciitis.\n\nWhen it comes to stretching there are a number of options available, each designed to address a different aspect of the condition. Stretching helps relieve pressure, strengthen the muscles of the leg and foot, and allows the plantar fascia to heal. Most stretches are conducted for between 15 and 30 seconds 4 or 5 times.\n\nMany people are able to experience relief by adding specific supplements and vitamins to their diet. For example, Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps reinforce the plantar fascia. For a full list of supplements that help heal the condition, see Fast Plantar Fasciitis Cure\u2122, a top selling guide by exercise rehabilitation specialist Jeremy Roberts.\n\nPlantar fasciitis is a painful condition that can have a serious impact on your personal and professional life. However, with the proper treatment plan, you can eliminate plantar fasciitis symptoms and heal the damaged tissue in your foot.

Under this administration's Directive 21-03 \"Eye for an Eye,\" clinical trials of \nthe replicated Red Horse strain against interred Islamic jihadist prisoners resulted in 100% mortality \nwithin 48 hours of exposure. \n\nInterestingly, whereas Ebola patients suffer tremendous and incapacitating pain, Red Horse \nsubjects acquire a degree of homicidal psychosis that can blind the subject to his own pain and \nimpending mortality. \n\nThis video, of captured U.S. Diplomat Jed Mather, shows the effects of the virus. \n\nUpon inhalation, Red Horse patients begin to bleed out. Massive hemorrhaging follows with \nsubjects bleeding from lachrymal ducts, ears (via cerebral spinal fluid) anus and urethra. In 65% of \nthose subjects tested, external stressors exacerbated the hemorrhage resulting in full mortality \nwithin 45 minutes. Unlike Ebola, full hemorrhagic fever did not present, nor did patients live long \nenough to manifest symptoms of necrotic organ tissue. In all cases, cause of death was \ndetermined to be massive hypovolemic shock. \n\n\nDevelopment \n\nApproximately two years ago, a weaponized biological agent code-named Red Horse was \ndiscovered within a laboratory facility inside the Caspian port-sector of Cheleken, Turkmenistan. \nThe facility poses as an environmental testing facility but is known to be a hub for jihadist CBRN \noperations. \n\nAssets in-theatre tracked delivery of Red Horse by air into Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Hand-off of the \nagent to known jihadist sympathizers was captured before vectoring a UAV asset to follow \nsubsequent delivery by land south across the Vaksh River to a village of approximately 15 \nfamilies outside of Kulyab. \n\nThe agent was then dispersed. Sat recon suggests a portable pesticide sprayer was used. \n\nThe agent proved 100% effective within the village. From Patient 0 to Patient Omega, (73 \npersons) it is believed that 51 hours had elapsed. \n\nWhile Tajik nationals are not overt sponsors of the jihadist movement, Muslim sympathies negate \nserious antipathy. It is reasonable to believe that this Kulyab Event was a beta test of Red Horse \nprior to deployment against CONUS. \n\nFollowing the Kulyab Event, our assets recovered the Tajik courier, Hamid Al-Mahvand, a second \nsample of Red Horse and plans for a Site B contingency test location, also in Tajikistan. \n\nSubsequently we received the Jed Mather video. It is clear that jihadist cells have sufficient \nquantities of this virus that they want us to know that they have it. \n\nThe Tajik Red Horse trial proved that the agent is sufficiently deadly that a full TRVA was \nconducted. A vaccine development program has proven to be a qualified success, but has \ndemonstrated several symptoms that cannot, as of this date, be countered without diminishing the \nefficacy of the vaccine. \n\n\nConclusion \n\nCIA threat-risk-vulnerability analysis concludes that Red Horse presents a dire threat to both the \nAdministration and its backers. Because Red Horse is believed to be at the disposal of \ndispersed jihadist operatives that may or may not be currently within CONUS, it is the \nrecommendation of the CIA that: \n\n\u2022Continued discretionary funding be diverted to increase safer, faster production of the\nRed Horse vaccine; \n\n\u2022Existing supplies of the vaccine be provided for National Command Authority, the most\nsenior strategic positions of the Administration and key corporate and religious figures,\nthen increasing distribution to less-senior positions as inventory permits; and, \n\n\u2022Restrict all knowledge of Red Horse to this distribution list's eyes only to permit deniability\nand mitigate panic. \n\nShould Red Horse fall under the umbrella of public scrutiny, we should anticipate a panic with \nsevere repercussions to both economic and foreign policies. Considering Red Horse's efficacy, a \npublic scare uncontained by official Vox channels risks provoking a \"use it or lose it\" attitude among \njihadist operatives inside CONUS.", "title": "The Red Horse Vector [Bio-Agent]", "publishedDate": "2008-05-14T18:16:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2h7EQ_IcPk0", "description": "Find out more about zoom optics and how to interpret the lens' zoom factor.

It's been a long time coming but now his second full length album, 'The Average Joe' is finally here. Named in celebration of the millions of unique stories that make every individual the person they are, this record gives a little more insight into the man behind the mic. The past years leading up to this release have been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride, with a lot of things happening in Joe's personal as well as artistic life. All of the different resulting emotions and contemplations are reflected in the diversity and maturity of his sophomore LP. \n\nBesides crafting his own beats, Joe enlisted a small army of talented musicians to contribute to this album. From the nu-soul sounds and vocals of Sacha Vee, via the dusty warmth of Vinyl Frontiers to the boombap vibes of Polish veterans O.S.T.R. and DJ Haem, just to name a few of the influences and collaborators on 'The Average Joe'. In addition, with trustworthy partners in crime Killing Skills as the executives, every track is produced into perfection. With this second LP, released on gold colored vinyl, Joe is taking Project: Mooncircle back to it's legendary hip hop roots. The Average Joe kicks ass, indeed.", "title": "Joe Kickass - Hey Joe ft.

In this series, Nye will demystify the cutting edge science behind NASA's groundbreaking Juno mission to Jupiter.   Watch Nye bring the Juno mission to life with his signature blend of props, performance, and solid scientific know how. \n\nEach episode of Why With Nye will focus on a different aspect of the Juno mission.  Nye will explore all sides of the mission, from defending against deadly planetary radiation belts, to mapping Jupiter's mysterious interior.  In each episode a prop filled \"desktop demonstration\" will explain the scientific principles at play. \n\nJuno is a NASA New Frontiers mission to the planet Jupiter.  The multi year mission will place a spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter, and will study Jupiter's gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.  The Juno mission will help to answer questions such as: how did Jupiter form?  Does it have a core?  How much water does it have?  Answering these questions is the key to understanding how our solar system, and ultimately our home planet Earth formed.", "title": "Bill Nye and Jupiter's Super Storm (Presented by NASA's Mission Juno)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T18:18:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hJykxWodbw", "description": "Chief Keef - Bussin\n\nDownload: http://goo.gl/rMDk2u\n\nGLOGangNation FaceBook!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GLOGangNationz\n\nGLOGangNationz Official Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/GLOGangHQ\n\nFollow on Twitter &amp; Instagram:\n@ChiefKeef\nhttps://twitter.com/ChiefKeef\nhttp://instagram.com/chieffkeeffsossa\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iChiefKeef\n@GLOGangHQ\nhttps://twitter.com/GLOGangHQ\n\n\u00a9 2014 Glo Gang Records \n\nChief Keef - Bussin\nChief Keef - Bussin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Keef\nChief Keef \n\n\nMigos Diss\nMigos Diss\n\nMigos Glo Gang Beef\nMigos GBE Beef\nMigos Capo Beef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOGangNation\nGloGang\nGlogang\nGlogangnation\nGloGangNation\nGloGang\n\n\n\n\nChief Keef\nLil Reese\nFredo Santana\nBallout\nSD\nTadoe\nTray Savage\nGino Marley\nCapo\nGlo Gang\nGlory Boyz\nSoulja Boy\nA.Goff\nMigos\nYung Gleesh\nA$AP\nWaka Flocka\nBo Deal\n3Hunna\n300\nBang\nBang bang\nApril Fools\nCitgo\nFinally Rich\nCaught Lackin\nNo lackin homie\nLackin&amp;#39;\nEnd Up Dead\nEverydayS Halloween\nI don&amp;#39;t like\nHate being sober\nHobby\nLove Sosa\nKobe\nI&amp;#39;m Dat Nigga\nMacaroni TIme\nNo Reason\nRound Da Rosey\nFuFu\nFugazy\nGucci Mane\nYoung Scooter\nYoung Fresh\nU.O.E.N.O\nKendrick Lamar\nLil JoJo\nCoreyDinero\nRaja Supreme\nLil Bibby\nKing Louie\nLil Herb\nLil Durk\nLil&amp;#39; Mister\nMontana of 300\nP.Rico\nT.I\nSoulja Boy\nwww.gbe300.com\nBDK\nInsane Disciples\nJOJO\nLil Jojo\nShit Is Real\nP.RICO\nTrappin Ain&amp;#39;t Dead\nScary Site 2\nBang 2\nBang 3\n***EXTRA TAGS***\ntrap,drill,chicago,fredo santana,chief keef,lil durk,lil jojo,put in work,tied up,sd,gino marley,tray savage,capo,tadoe,lil reese,p.rico,rico reklezz,stain,bosstop,lil mister,young chop,smylez,beats,beat,instrumental,remi\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adx,viral,killa kellz,ballout,glo gang,1017 glo gang,savage squad,gbe,bdk,300,3hunna,black disciples,gangster disciples,insane,069,bricksquad,swagg,li\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adl jay,fbg,duck,tookaville,jojo,death,hang wit me,chiraq,chicago,drill,king yella,king louie,mikey dollaz,mic,il will,lil chris,d bo,t roy,block,lamron,chicago,gun,crime,arres\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adt,new,music,release,bang part 2,bang,part,two,super savage,GLONL,life of a savage,billionaire black,gucci mane,waka flocka,diss,beef,bloodmoney,gloryboyz,bo deal,flip,percy jones,lil herb,lil bibby,lil mouse,matti baybee,lil zay,versace,twitter,woofin,disses,rondon\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adumbanine,600,la capone,signed to the streets,mix tape,free,download,gas,lean,molly,judo heffner, Jank,485,duke da beast,clout,montana of 300,king dre,moosalina,808 mafia,zaytoven,migos diss,mike will made it,tm88,metro booming,c note,sonny digital,dun deal,fat trel,dirty vans,love sosa,fuck sosa,gunja,juicy j,dgainz,king samson,flytyboy,dgaines1234,dgainz,hidef\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adinitionphotos,itzjaybeatz,$wagg,C4,h\u00adi\u00adt\u00adt\u00adz\u00ad,CKFDltd,bd,gd,bgdn,soulja boy,SODMG,gang,crime,gangland,american,m\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adubu.SODMG\nOcean Gang, SPLASH, A.Goff, Tez Poe, Lil T", "title": "Chief Keef - Bussin (Prod.

Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae, that includes the tomistoma, was excluded in this article since new genetic studies reveal the possibility of tomistoma as a close relative of the gharial.[1] This article applies the term crocodile only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia: which includes all members of Crocodylidae, including the tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), and the rest of Crocodylomorpha, which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.\n\nAlthough they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial having a narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into. Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family, the species belongs to.[2] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians, are the much higher levels of aggression.[3] All reptiles are all scaled diapsids, which are divided into two groups: crocodilians are archosaurs, along with birds and the extinct dinosaurs, while other reptiles are lepidosaurs.\n\nAlthough all crocodiles are anatomically and biologically similar; their size, morphology, behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.[4] A lineage, including the rest of Crocodylomorpha, have been around for at least 225 million years, survived multiple mass extinctions, but today, due to habitat destruction and poaching, many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.---SOURCE CODE TAKEN FROM WIKIPEDIA.", "title": "CROKODILES RESTING", "publishedDate": "2013-12-10T15:04:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hTP7iD2RMc", "description": "http://www.ourbeautifulgarden.com/\nBeautiful leafy plant - Caladium lindenii 'Magnificum'", "title": "Beautiful leafy plant - Caladium lindenii 'Magnificum'", "publishedDate": "2012-10-16T16:19:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hTXAsVQ9AM", "description": "\uc5b4\ubc84\uc774\ub0a0 \uce74\ub124\uc774\uc158 \ube44\ub204\uaf43 \uc120\ubb3c \uc18c\uac1c\uc601\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\ubcc0\uce58\uc54a\ub294 \ube44\ub204\uaf43 \ud574\ud53c\ud50c\ub77c\uc6cc(http://www.salehappy.co.kr)\uc640\n\uc54c\ub9ac\ubc14\ubc14 \ub531\ud558\ub098\ub2f7\ucef4(http://www.ddakhana.com)\uc774 \ud568\uaed8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4", "title": "[\uc5b4\ubc84\uc774\ub0a0]\uce74\ub124\uc774\uc158 \ube44\ub204\uaf43 \uc120\ubb3c \uc2a4\uc2b9\uc758\ub0a0 \ud574\ud53c\ud50c\ub77c\uc6cc", "publishedDate": "2009-04-24T06:12:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hTsM28WpOc", "description": "For IN the NOW with Anissa Naouai, The Resident conducts an experiment on the streets of New York City: how do people react when people say mean things in person like they say online?

Make a Layton-style adventure game with rhythm minigames instead of puzzles. Maybe I'm just burnt by the cliffhanger ending. Who knows?\n\nThe song \"Mastermind\" is from near the end of the game. Storywise it's crazy as usual, Phantom R must dance to stop Paris from being destroyed because of his magic bracelet. At this point in the game you've seen enough bad disguises and weird dancing moments that it's nothing special. However, this time Marie is cheering you on with her magic violin. Stay with me here.\n\nThe song is great because it's a mix of the dance music from the earlier dance stages and the gorgeous violin music. The intro is my favorite piece of music in the whole game. It's starts off as a slow dramatic piece, then eventually builds and builds into something fantastic. There's even singing, and I hated the singing throughout the game, but here it's not bad. I mean, sure, it would be perfect without it, but it's still pretty good despite that.

Humiliated to be pulled naked from bed, he was repeatedly terrorised with the threat of instant murder if he did not fully comply and submit.\n\nThat victim of home invasion was Gordon Clark, a film director freshly returned from 26 years in Hollywood.\nSome investigation in the ensuing days revealed that his story was not at all news-worthy - not even to the local rag!  His tale was too mundane - every neighbour on all sides had been through similar.\nThe further he looked, the more-of-the-same he found - in every suburb across the country.\nTo air their plight and turn an urgent spotlight on the terror of it, Gordon resolved to give his neighbours the microphone to let them tell their story and put a human face on the bald statistics of home-invasion attacks that run with the monotonous repetitiveness of ticker-tape. \n\n#BehindParadiseTheMovie peels back the covers to illustrate what most of us don't realize about our own environment - be that environment another suburb or farm community - until we too become victims of ambush.\n\n\nThis documentary exposes reality in a single 'average' suburb of South Africa:\n - Every 3rd* night in just that small community, yet another family is assaulted; marauding gangs, sometimes military trained, burst in brandishing knives and guns\n   * 143 \"Robbery with aggravating circumstances\" in 2013 - as indicated by official police statistics at: \nhttp://www.crimestatssa.com/precinct.php?id=1081 - where the 'Robbery with aggravating circumstances\" category shows an unchecked rise from 2004, when 33 incidents occurred, until, 10 years later, a total of 813 individual victims or families in just this one suburb are now dealing with the terror of this dreadful experience.\n\nVictims are routinely threatened with murder, terrified to their core, and stripped of their valuables, dignity and sleep for years to come.\nTheir lives change forever.\nMost suburbs suffer similarly - there is nowhere to flee to.  Many emigrate.\n\nWatch the trailer, share this message, and, when voting days come around, send your politicians a powerful message - remind them: \"You are our servant - we pay the bills - protect us.\"\n\n___\n\nPLEASE VISIT our primary sponsor at: http://www.VoiceAlert.co.za \n\n----------\n\nOfficial Facebook and Twitter pages:\n\n- http://wwww.facebook.com/behindparadisethemovie\n\n- https://twitter.com/BehindParadise\n\nFeel free to stream or download the full 42-minute MP3 movie soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/stream", "title": "Behind Paradise - Suburb-after-Suburb Under Siege in South Africa", "publishedDate": "2014-03-19T16:43:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hnhv9PwcY8", "description": "More details:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nMore About plant preventive maintenance flow chart, Please Visit:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nSBM as one of the largest mining and crushing equipments manufacturers and vendors all over the world, we provide cone crusehr, jaw crusher, grinding mill, mobile crusher, ball mill, washer machine, vibrating screen, belt conveyor, etc for quarry plant to process iron, gold, aggregate, artificial sand, limestone, asphalt, ballast, bauxite, brick, cement, ceramic, clay, concrete, construction, glass, gypsum, kaolin, coke, coal, barite, bentonite, clinker, dolomite, earth, feldspar, fluorspar, fly ash, garnet, graphite, gravel, marble, talc, mica, perlite, porcelain, pozzolana, quartz, rubble, salt, silica, slate, soapstone, soda, sizing, bottle, aluminum, antimony, calcium, chrome, copper, diamond, hematite, Lead, lithium, magnesium, magnetite, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, pyrite, anthracite,etc.\nSBM company provide quarry plant machine for India, Oman, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Amercia, Indonesia, Sri lanka, Ghana, Uae, Iran, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi arabia, Australia, Thailand, Burma, Yemen, UK, Hungary, British, France, Russian, Gemany, England, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Nigera, Botswana, SA, Nigeria, Uganda, Gabon, Zambia, Ethiopia , Mauritania, USA, Canada, Peru, etc more than 100 countries.\nIf you need the answers of the questions, you can send messages to us or by the online services:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nPlant Preventive Maintenance Flow Chart\nFacilities Maintenance Help Desk Flow Chart.pdf eBooks for Free.

Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses \u2014 exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific.[1] Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. More than 20 families are currently recognized, comprising about 500 genera and about 3,400 species.[2][3] They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to the Reticulated python of up to 8.7 meters (29 ft) in length.[4][5] The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 meters (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.\nMost species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.", "title": "2009-11 Borneo slangen Wim Peters.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-06-28T18:43:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hu5YKxH77g", "description": "There is another way to see this allusion between Sirius and the Pleiades, and it takes on the image of a serpent's, or to the Greeks, a dragon's tooth that was planted as seeds. The following is taken from an article entitled, NASA continues ritual pattern as Discovery docks with IS (I) S, at the Enterprise Mission web site @ http://www.enterprisemission.com/isis.htm\n\n    \"As Robert Temple has shown in the recently revised edition of his famous book \"The Sirius Mystery,\" the Egyptian Goddess Isis was interchangeable with the star Sirius. According to Temple, Isis the personage and the star were both represented by a variety of hieroglyphs, but among them were the cobra or serpent and the serpent's tooth.\"\n \n\"The tooth is a vertically elongated triangle, rather than the equilateral triangle we are used to seeing associated with Sirius, and the cobra is coiled as if to attack. Taken together, they literally translate to \"the Goddess Sirius.\"\n\n     As I covered in the second chapter, goddesses associated with Isis, but in warring representations of the Daughter's of Ra, received their power to kill from the Eye of Ra, taken from atop Ra's Serpent Crown. This is an allusion to the Pleiades, because they are at the tip of the serpent's fang, (Isosceles shaped Cyon Star formation), where the deadly poison is spat. This fang tip is where the Sun is with the Pleiades, or Eye of Ra, and it sets antipodal to the Sun's position atop the head of Scorpio, which is the cobra's image. All of this, is the same representation of the Wadjet goddess, (a cobra), with the Wadjet Eye, which is a symbol of war represented by the Sun in relation to the helical rising of the Pleiades that are the shape of the Wadjet Eye.   \n\n     In both the Iliad and the Argonaut's myths, the epics end with a serpent's bite upon reaching the shores of Alexandria, and as a result the pilots of both myths are honored with the building of a temple to Serapis. Again, if the Nile Delta is seen as the head of Scorpio, the City of Alexandria is the ecliptic antipodal position of the superimposed Pleiades, i.e. Alexandria is the place of the bite, because it represents the antipodal position of the tip of the serpent's tooth, which is the Pleiades. And as I am elucidating, Serapis is Osiris in the Apis Bull form, which is the constellation Taurus with the seeds of the Ka, or life force represented by the Pleiades. I want to emphasize the two aspects of the Pleiades here, as being both the representation of death's poison and the seeds of resurrection.", "title": "Occult Readings 6", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T02:14:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2hux2KX16M8", "description": "A unarmed farmhand was killed using a poisoned arrow, in Olepolos, Mau Narok, Njoro Sub County  bringing the death toll to 4 in a span of four years near the Muthera Farm.\n\nThe land was still at the centre of a legal battle over ownership between the Maasai Community and the Koinange Family.

Some reflect worshipping God, while others are prayers and hymns calling for help, protection, forgiveness, salvation and songs of thanksgiving. \nRulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word (Psalm 119:161).

Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws (Psalm 119:164). Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble (Psalm 119:165). I wait for your salvation, oh Lord, and I follow your commands (Psalm 119:166). I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly (Psalm 119:167). I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you (Psalm 119:168).\nThought for today: when confronting difficulty, put your trust in God.\nThought for the future: no matter where you turn in life, you can always turn to God.

We thought that when we had the technology in place that the informational problems would be solved, instead they've compounded in their complexity.\n\nST: You know it's interesting, technology always seems to be the panacea, right. But the people process portion is probably equally as important. But you know, the changes you're saying, must make it more urgent for an information governance council to be in place to guide that change, and make sure that all of the different perspectives on the data are being shared.\n\nLK: We look at the strategic goals of an individual healthcare organization, every one of them is completely dependent on access and use of that information -- ranging from public policy all the way to an individual patient encounter. And that's true throughout the healthcare field, right from policy in Washington to using that information in an individual patient encounter.\n\nST: I just came from the Managing Electronic Records conference, and there were statistics that 40 percent, that we'll experience at least a 40 percent growth in information just this year. Volume, velocity, variety, it just demands that there's a concerted view of how to manage that information, and also mined for additional value -- Who your clients are? What additional products might need to be introduced, or how you sell those products to customers in healthcare. So it is time to measure governance.\n\nLK: There's another wrinkle to healthcare that I always need to bring to the floor, and that's that information we're managing isn't ours, it's the patient's. And so we have a special stewardship obligation to govern that data wisely and well to benefit the patient but also because the health information is really used for the public good. And I think that creates an obligation that's very aligned with the healthcare mission and I think that's a real area where we need to emphasize.", "title": "Why Information Governance Now?: Ep 41, HealthcareTalks", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T13:27:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2i6Ir-kvImg", "description": "Are mortgage insurance costs making FHA loans a bad deal? Recently, the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance has skyrocketed, making FHA loans more expensive than conventional loans.\n\nYou can save between $1,740 and $12,026 in just over five years if you take out a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance over an FHA loan, according to a new report from WalletHub, a financial information and networking site.\n\nThe FHA loan volume skyrocketed 330 percent from 2007 to 2009, after the housing market crashed. Now they've gone back to being the place of last resort because many of the loans they made went bad, and they've struggled to meet financial obligations. \n\nAs a result, FHA mortgage insurance premiums have more than doubled since 2008. Five years ago, if you took out a loan for a median-priced home at $212,000, you would have paid $9,200 in FHA premiums over the first five years of the loan. But if you bought that same house today, it would cost $17,398 in premiums. That's an $8,000 dollar increase for a home only priced at $212,000.\n\nOnce the borrower has 20 percent equity in their home, lenders will normally cancel private mortgage insurance. However, the FHA won't. So borrowers will not only pay more in the first few years of an FHA loan, they will continue to pay for it through the entire life of the loan. \n\nWith FHA loans costing more than conventional loans, this has created an interesting swing for first time buyers who are credit-challenged and can't get a loan in the conventional market. \n\nLooking for more of my real estate and personal finance tips?\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ExpertRealEstateTips\nRead my blog: http://thinkglink.com\nSee my tweets: http://www.twitter.com/glink\nFollow me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ilyceglink", "title": "Are Mortgage Insurance Costs Making FHA Loans a Bad Deal?", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T16:58:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "2i6LhaKTvOs", "description": "please check out my orginal channel for more videos :)\nwww.youtube.com/just516in\nwww.facebook.com/just516in\n\n\n\nNo fish were harmed during the filming of this movie and\nfirearm was unloaded filming this video :)", "title": "Puffer fish chases laser", "publishedDate": "2012-02-21T05:07:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2i6NXIVzpN0", "description": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDOWNLOAD ON ITUNES! https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/world-cup-song-feat.-randolph/id880336212\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe official YouTube World Cup song!

The planet is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. It is also referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because of its reddish appearance, due to iron oxide prevalent on its surface. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth. Unlike the Earth, Mars is now a geologically inactive planet with no tectonic activity.

For so many of QVC's viewers, Lisa Robertson is the host with the most.\nRobertson, 48, is one of the shopping channel's most popular personalities. Every week, the former Miss Tennessee sells the latest in beauty and fashion, drawing an estimated 20 million viewers a week.\nThat prominence has brought her a lot of attention, some of it unwanted.\nIn court documents obtained by the Daily Local News of Chester County, Pa., Robertson, who lives in Chester County, alleges that she has secretly lived in constant fear of one of a number of men who have reportedly been obsessed with her during her time with the network.\nIn a recent victim's impact statement, Robertson reportedly wrote: \"I lock myself in my house every day. I check my alarm constantly ... I watch my rearview mirror when I go home at night ... if there is a sound at night, I lay awake wondering.\"\nIn December, 50-year-old Peter Ferriera was sentenced to 7 years' probation for violating a court order from a previous stalking conviction. He is appealing.\nFerriera was first arrested for stalking Robertson 10 years ago. He allegedly went to Robertson's home and followed her to a movie theater, where he was, according to a police affidavit, \"close enough to Robertson that he could smell the popcorn she was eating.\"   \nIn that case, he pleaded guilty to stalking, and served 132 days in jail.\nRobertson's tenure at QVC was marked by more terror, as other men were also obsessed with her. In one case, according to the Los Angeles Times, one of those men reportedly traveled to the home of another QVC host, hoping to meet Robertson there. Police reportedly said that strapped to the man's chest were engagement and wedding rings.\nIn a statement to ABC News, Robertson said, in part:  \"... We enjoy the connection we have with our audience from being open and sharing our personal stories.  Unfortunately, one of the downsides to this is that people can take these connections too far and cross personal boundaries.\"", "title": "QVC Lisa Robertson Fears Stalkers Former Miss Tennessee Life in Fear", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T12:54:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2iHMVyrqWfw", "description": "Le 4\u00e8me mandat du Dictateur \nAbdelaziz Bouteflika \nexplique comment la France \na pu coloniser\nl'Alg\u00e9rie pendant 132 ans", "title": "Bouteflika explique comment la France a pu coloniser l'Alg\u00e9rie pendant 132 ans", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T12:56:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2iHQZc02R8w", "description": "Here we answer some very popular questions about the PA-5000.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "New 2014 Cadillac CTS V ahmed", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:04:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2iOi_Asqn0A", "description": "\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093\u304c\u4e00\u751f\u61f8\u547d\u4e2d\u56fd\u5f0f\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u3092\u713c\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3061\u306a\u307f\u306b\u3053\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30d7\u5c4b\u306f\u58c1\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n0507 \u5e08\u5085\u505a\u524d\u997c \u771f\u597d\u5403\uff01\uff01", "title": "Chinese Crepe", "publishedDate": "2007-05-12T16:46:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2iP4GOgQMsY", "description": "The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has created a number of fishery management measures designed to promote fishing techniques that improve the survival of fish that are caught and released.

Over the years scientists have proposed different theories to explain this puzzling phenomenon.\n\nHowever, according to paleontologist Cynthia Marshal Foe, there is only one legitimate explanation, which is that the dinosaurs died of asphyxiation. It is well know that animals, starved of oxygen when the die, can go into this characteristic posture due to muscle spasms. \n\nThis new understanding of dinosaur fossilization fits well with the Bible's history, where many dinosaurs were rapidly buried in sediment during the global flood. Starved of oxygen, many assumed this unique affixation posture. \n\nSo the Biblical flood provides a simple solution to a long held dinosaur mystery. \n\nRelated Articles:\nDeath Throes (http://creation.com/death-throes)\nWater and death throes (http://creation.com/water-death-throes)\nFossils Q&A (http://creation.com/fossils-questions-and-answers)\n\nRelated Products:\nCreation Answers Book (http://creation.com/store_redirect.php?sku=10-2-505)\nAmazing Fossils Comic Book (http://creation.com/store_redirect.php?sku=00-1-001)\nDinosaur Challenges and Mysteries Book (http://creation.com/store_redirect.php?sku=10-2-582)\nFossil Evidence of Creation DVD (http://creation.com/store_redirect.php?sku=30-9-501)", "title": "Death Throes -- Dinosaur fossil posture suggests asphyxiation", "publishedDate": "2013-02-11T13:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2iUrQDiZJas", "description": "Billy Talent - Line And Sinker 05.12.2009 K\u00f6ln, Die Kantine | Comment !

The music is by John Kander with lyrics by Fred Ebb and a book by Ebb and Bob Fosse. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration of criminal justice, and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\". The musical is based on a 1926 play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins about actual criminals and crimes she reported on.\n\nThe original Broadway production opened June 3, 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre and ran for 936 performances. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. Chicago's 1996 Broadway revival holds the record for the longest-running musical revival on Broadway (not counting the revue Oh! Calcutta!) and is Broadway's sixth longest-running show. As of January 12, 2010, it has played for more than 5,400 performances. The revival was followed by a production on London's West End theatre and several tours and international productions. An Academy Award-winning film version of the musical was released in 2002, directed by Rob Marshall and starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifah.\n\nThe musical Chicago is based on a play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of murderesses Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of Roxie Hart, was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,  murder of Harry Kalstedt. The Tribune reported that Annan played the foxtrot record \"Hula Lou\" over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\". She was found \"not guilty\" on May 25, 1924. Velma is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Gaertner was acquitted on June 6, 1924. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in Chicago, \"Billy Flynn\"\n\nJohn Kander and Fred Ebb began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional vaudeville number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society.

Daher r\u00fchre das Aussehen des wie abgetrennt erscheinenden Wurzelstocks. Der Teufelsabbiss ist eng mit der Skabiose (Scabiosa L.) verwandt. Scabiosa ist eine Ableitung vom lateinischen scabies (Kr\u00e4tze). Beide Pflanzen wurden als Heilmittel bei Krankheiten angewandt, so z. B. bei Ekzemen, Geschw\u00fcren, Endz\u00fcndungen der Schleimh\u00e4ute und Wurmbefall, ja man verwendete diese Heilpflanzen sogar gegen Syphilis und Pest. Die auswurff\u00f6rdernden Eigenschaften des Teufelsabbiss helfen bei Erkrankungen der Atemwege, auch wirkt er blutreinigend und harntreibend. Dem Wurzelstock des Teufelsabbiss werden zudem verdauungsf\u00f6rdernde Eigenschaften zugeschrieben, er kann als Grundlage f\u00fcr einen ausgezeichneten Lik\u00f6r dienen. Fr\u00fcher stellte man aus den Bl\u00e4ttern der Pflanze einen Tee-Ersatz her. Der von Faltern und Bienen besuchte Teufelsabbiss schm\u00fcckt im Sommer und Herbst feuchte Wiesen und S\u00fcmpfe mit seinen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig verzweigten St\u00e4ngeln, die in blauen Bl\u00fctenk\u00f6pfen enden.\n\nJe nach Standort wird der ausdauernde Teufelsabbiss 15 bis 50, manchmal sogar bis 80 cm hoch. Die aufrechten, mit wenigen Blattpaaren wachsenden  St\u00e4ngel sind im unteren Bereich der Pflanze kahl, im oberen Bereich behaart und verzweigt. Die derben, l\u00e4nglich-Ianzettlichen Bl\u00e4tter sind gegenst\u00e4ndig angeordnet. Die Blattr\u00e4nder sind ganzrandig, die oberen Bl\u00e4tter sind manchmal ges\u00e4gt. Die Bl\u00fctezeit erstreckt sich von Juli bis September. Die blauvioletten Bl\u00fcten bilden sich in halbkugeligen, von breit-Ianzettlichen H\u00fcllbl\u00e4ttern umgebenen, langgestielten K\u00f6pfchen. \nStandort / Hier findet man den Teufelsabbiss\n\nDer Teufelsabbiss w\u00e4chst im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Die Pflanze bevorzugt Magerwiesen, feuchte Wiesen, feuchte Gr\u00e4ben und Flachmoore. Man findet den Teufelsabbiss bis in H\u00f6henlagen von 2000 m.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Teufelsabbiss\n\nadstringierend, f\u00f6rdert den Auswurf, blutreinigend, magenwirksam, schwei\u00dftreibend, tonisch, wundheilend\nIn der Naturheilkunde verwendete Pflanzenteile\n\nIn der Naturheilkunde benutzt man von dem Teufelsabbiss den getrockneten Wurzelstock, die Bl\u00e4tter, die Bl\u00fctenk\u00f6pfe und den frischen Saft.\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nWichtige Inhaltsstoffe dieser Heilpflanze sind: Glykoside, Polyphenole, Alkaloide, Saponin, Gerbstoffe\n\nDer Teufelsabbiss wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet.

I captured it for you. Isn't it remarkably how they do that?\n\nEnten sind sehr saubere Tiere, wie man hier sieht. Man muss sich die Bewegungen mal genau anschauen.\n\n\nDuck is the common name for a number of species in the Anatidae family of birds. The ducks are divided between several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.\n\nDucks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.\n\n(Wiki Info)\n\nDie Familie der Entenv\u00f6gel (Anatidae) ist die artenreichste aus der Ordnung der G\u00e4nsev\u00f6gel (Anseriformes). Sie umfasst 47 Gattungen und etwa 150 Arten. Zu dieser Gruppe geh\u00f6ren so bekannte Typen von Wasserv\u00f6geln wie die Enten, G\u00e4nse und Schw\u00e4ne. Vielleicht abgesehen von den H\u00fchnerv\u00f6geln hat keine andere Vogelgruppe so zahlreiche Wechselbeziehungen zum Menschen: Allein f\u00fcnf Arten wurden domestiziert, Entenv\u00f6gel werden wegen ihres Fleisches, ihrer Eier und ihrer Federn gejagt und gehalten, und in vielerlei Form haben sie Eingang in M\u00e4rchen, Sagen und Comics erhalten.", "title": "Duck washing action - be clean!

It's called ANA, or antinuclear antibody.  This is the first test that doctors order when patients are suspected of having Lupus, and it indicates that their bodies are making antibodies, which are substances that bind to the nuclei of cells.  \n\nNow, what's in the nuclei of cells and why do these substances bind to them?  In order to discuss that, I'm going to introduce a new term.  The term is NuComs, or Nucleic Acid Components.  It refers to DNA, which is composed, as chemists know, of nucleic acids and the things that make them up.  It's been definitively established over the last few years that these antibodies to NuComs are responsible for creating many of the worst signs and symptoms of Lupus-for the arthritis, the joint problems, the rashes that occur on the skin, and the kidney disease.  \n\nIn the normal American diet, we take in a large excess of NuComs.  These substances may be responsible for the flares, the worsening, which is generally thought to be unpredictable, which occurs in these patients.  There's good reason to believe that reducing the excess of these NuComs, which comes in the typical American diet, will also reduce the signs and symptoms of Lupus, including the rashes, the arthritis, and the kidney disease.  \n\nIn order to do that, I've created a new diet which markedly reduces the amount of these substances, but is balanced in every other respect that patients need.  This diet is called DART, for Dietary Auto-Immunity Reduction Therapy, and I'll be discussing it in more detail in the next video.", "title": "What causes Lupus?", "publishedDate": "2013-05-13T19:13:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2igS3UT6mkI", "description": "BoA`s appearance from 0:44", "title": "[140703] BoA on Japanese TV show \u300c\u6d5c\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c!\u300d", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T05:03:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2igejj6BRcw", "description": "", "title": "Lycopodium Chem Toddler", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T15:15:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2igiAkQOeY0", "description": "From Episode 2.5.", "title": "Primeval Creatures - Silurian Millipede", "publishedDate": "2014-01-01T16:31:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ih2cg7XfAE", "description": "Attention: I do not claim any copyrights on this track.

And so you want to um, when you're doing a fondu you wanna find that place in between you calf muscle and your ankle. And this is the place that you want to put your toe. And you wanna make sure that you have a nice foot position and that's not sickled or winged. So you wanna place your foot in that position and bend both legs together and then straighten them. And the same thing talked about in the tondus you wanna make sure that you're not over crossing in the front or the back and that you're following your natural turnout line to the side. So I'm going to demonstrate fondu front, side, and back. And I'm going to demonstrate in fifth position which you can either do in fifth or first position.

It lays its eggs most often on Lilium and Fritillaria species. In the absence of Lilium and Fritillaria species, there are fewer eggs laid and the survival rate of eggs and larvae is reduced.  It is now a pest in most temperate climates where lilies are cultivated. The beetle overwinters in the soil and emerges early in spring. The adult is generally found in moist, cool environments. It emerges in spring to feed and mate. The female can lay up to 450 eggs each season in batches of about 12 on the undersides of leaves. It arranges the eggs in irregular lines along the midrib, where they are more concealed. The eggs hatch in about 6 days and the larvae feed for up to 24 days, beginning underneath the leaf then working up the rest of the plant. They then burrow in the ground to pupate in a cocoon of soil bound with saliva. In about 20 days they emerge as adults and continue to feed until winter. More than one cycle can occur in one year. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Beetle\n\n\nThe red or scarlet lily beetle  has become the lily growers' nemesis. Both the adults and larvae can defoliate lilies (Lilium and Cardiocrinum) and fritillaries (Fritillaria). Adults are 8mm long, bright red with a black head and legs. Eggs are 1mm long and orange-red, found in groups on the underside of lily and fritillary leaves. Larvae have orange bodies with black heads but are normally covered with their own slimy black excrement. The fully grown larvae are 8-10mm long. The pupal stage is in the soil. :  http://www.rhs.org.uk/science/plant-pests/lily-beetle \n\nBiology and Behaviour of the Lily Beetle : http://www.lilies.org/pdfs/lilybeetle.pdf", "title": "Scarlet lily beetle - Rau\u00f0 Liljubjalla   - Bj\u00f6llur - Liljubj\u00f6llur - Skord\u00fdr", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T22:01:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2j0NDcBDiB8", "description": "", "title": "Amputation Treatment with SWAT T **Warning   Graphic Video**", "publishedDate": "2013-02-07T14:48:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2j0PRC4-qhs", "description": "Baptist Smart Medicine Clip 19e", "title": "Baptist Smart Medicine Clip 19e - OTC Medication Facts", "publishedDate": "2007-06-27T22:02:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2j0XZihGDMA", "description": "Oscar Taveras Dies In Car Accident Muere pelotero Oscar Taveras y su novia en accidente en Santigo 201 Muere pelotero Oscar Taveras y su novia en accidente en Santigo 2014 RAW VIDEO -- Memories Oscar Taveras dies in car Crash Accident - Died Dead Body St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras &amp; girlfriend die in car accident in Puerto Plata, DR Muere pelotero Oscar Taveras y su novia en accidente en Santigo Pic from scene at 22 Years Old MLB Baseball Dominican Republic Dominicano Pelotero Muere Acidente de carro cuerpo Muere Muerto 10/26/2014!!!Oscar Taveras Dies In Car AccidentBy Charlie Wilmoth lowres Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras has Oscar Taveras, dies, in, car Crash, Accident - Dead at 22, With his girlfriend in car accident car crash, died on 22 yearRAW VIDEO -- Memories Oscar Taveras dies in car Crash Accident - Died Dead Body St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar .Oscar Taveras Dead in Car accident - Oscar Taveras Crash Car Images [EXCLUSIVE]Oscar Taveras Dead in Car accident - Oscar Taveras Crash Car Images [Exclusive] Oscar Taveras Dead in Car accident - Oscar Oscar Taveras Dies at 22 - Oscar Taveras Died in Car accident [TRIBUTE] (R.I.P)Oscar Taveras Dies at 22 - Oscar Taveras Died in Car accident [R.I.P] Oscar Taveras Dies at 22 - Oscar Taveras Died in Car .Intis soaress,Muere pelotero Oscar Taveras y su novia en accidente en Santigo 2014Muere pelotero Oscar Taveras y su novia en accidente en Santigo 2014 Oscar Taveras Died, dies car crash Subscribe Here: .Oscar Taveras dies in car Crash Accident - Dead at 22 [RIP TRIBUTE]RAW VIDEO -- Memories Oscar Taveras dies in car Crash Accident - Died Dead Body St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar .Oscar Taveras, OF, St Louis CardinalsSt. Louis Cardinals OF prospect Oscar Taveras For more video of Oscar Taveras click here .HDTaveras signed with the Cardinals in 2008 and, within a few years, became one of the top young talents in the game.

You can find numerous videos detailing the results of these filters at - https://www.youtube.com/user/statisticalapproach. \n\nThis specific shortlist includes 235 players who are all under 10m and under 35 years old. \n\n\nI can't stress this enough - please try to look past some of the \"conventional\" stats when using this shortlist. Give it a go and see if you can have the same success I've had in numerous saves (link to videos above).\n\n\nAs mentioned - PLEASE take into account your own judgment of the player and if he'll actually improve your club. If you are Real Madrid manager and sign a 34 year old CB from the Danish leagues then it's probably not going to work out well. If you are Accrington Stanley manager he'd probably be a fantastic signing for your club. It's all about using this shortlist to find value for your club.\n\n\n* some of the players on the list are well know but there is a huge number of \n\n\"unknown\" type players who perform well above expectations and market value. \n\n\n\nPlease download the shortlist and see for yourself!\n\n\n***************************************\n\nDOWNLOAD LINK - http://www.fmscout.com/a-moneyball-shortlist-for-fm14.html\n\n***************************************\n\n\nAlso please check out the new wonderkids shortlist by fmscout -http://www.fmscout.com/a-football-manager-2014-wonderkids.html", "title": "Moneyball Shortlist - 371 players included - Football Manager 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-04T14:07:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2jAVUqSef5g", "description": "In 1972, NASA's Landsat program launched on a mission to planet Earth.

documentary, short\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000410/\n\nThis film shows the demolition of the historic Star Theatre building (formerly Wallack's) at the corner of Broadway and 13th Street, New York. To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.", "title": "Demolishing and Building Up the Star Theatre (1901)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T21:34:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2jJ_-Lwkc1U", "description": "At http://www.do-it-yourself-joint-pain-relief.com/neck-and-shoulder-pain-relief.html learn a do-it-yourself neck and shoulder pain relief treatment  that can be done by anyone, anytime, anywhere.

We do the choke from here.  Now, lets talk about what not to do.  Alright, so we've all heard this.  \n\nNow, this is a neanderthal choke, not to say it doesn't work, but we've moved beyond that, we're more technical, more advanced, more leverage.  Watch again.  So, my hand doesn't go behind his head like this, it goes to my shoulder and I tuck.  Why?  I do this, he's going to grab my glove, and once he has that glove, it's very hard to finish the choke, he's going to pull it off.  Bringing the arm to the other side of his head and now there's no way I can choke him.  Very hard.  Alright, this happens to a lot of fighters doing that choke. Not to say it's wrong, it's not, it's just a little insufficient.  Alright, so what am I going to do?  First, snake around here, here at this control, keep me on the ground too, see right here.  \n\nChad, pull on my arm as hard as you can. You see how he's pulling on my arm, he can pull as hard as he wants on my arm, he'll never get that off, because I have this here.  He's going to try and grab my hand.  Boom, I punch it off.  Go, go boom, punch it off.  Boom, punch it off.  X marks the spot.  Slide, grab your shoulder tuck.  Chad, try and pull my hands out.  Nothing happening.  And I squeeze.  One more time, Chad is going to choke me.  He gets that sneak around my body.  See, he's got this control here.  He peels my hand off.  Makes X mark the spot.  Slides, tucks to the head, and finishes.  Alright one more time.  Here.  Boom. Like this.  This position, broken harness, X marks the spot, slide, tuck.  Okay, now what did I say, I said broken harness.  \n\nThis is the harness and we'll talk about that soon.  This is the position, here, we're going to talk about then ground control, broken harness, this is that snake position here, X marks the spot, this hand in front, slide, tuck your head, he's not going anywhere.  One more time.  Broken harness, X marks the spot, slide, finish.  Again, he starts grabbing your hand, peel it off.  Just like that.  One more time, full speed.  On the ground.
