Before he left, we adopted (are long term foster parents for SNARR-a special needs animal rescue) a special needs puppy with a severe birth defect.  Emma and her daddy were very close!  It broke her, and his, heart when he left.  When I come in the door, she normally sits at the end of the hallway and waits for me to pick her up.  This time, when her daddy came in, she went to him!  Mikey (the tan dog) was so happy he cried!  Gotta love homecomings!!\nMany have asked why Emma doesn't have a doggy wheelchair.  Emma has had several wheelchairs.  Unfortunately, she refuses to use any of them.  We have had custom ones made even.  We have worked with the companies to teach her to use it, but she will have nothing to do with it or with a \"drag bag\" or harness.  She's always been this way.  Emma has no idea she's \"special\".  She loves life and runs and plays well on her own outdoors.  She just has a little trouble on the tile indoors.  We do have rugs layed out for her all over the house, but we did not have any in this hallway at the time.  That's why you see her hopping to him.  Please watch her other videos on here or on her Facebook page (link below) to see how she really gets around.  \n\nAlso, Emma is still under the medical care of SNARR, the special needs rescue group that we got her from as foster parents.  So that they can keep a close eye on her, they have agreed to let us keep her for the rest of her life (Woohoo!) but still pay her medical bills, which are quite expensive at times.  If you want to check them out, see the other special dogs they have there, and possibly donate to help pay Emma's medical bills, please check out their website:\nhttp://snarranimalrescue.org/.  \nThey also have a FB page that's updated more often:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SNARRDOGPOLICE?ref=ts&fref=ts\n\nWe, as Emma's parents, are not asking for ANY money!  Any money donated goes directly to the animal rescue, not to us.  We are blessed enough just to have her!\n\nHere's Emma's FB page if you wanna read more about her and see more videos:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/EverythingEmmaDog?ref=ts&fref=ts", "title": "Airman comes home to handicapped dog from 6 month deployment!", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T04:22:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "62GRJN7gzpA", "description": "A Common Fly Found Almost All Over The World.

This Play Doh toy is similar to the Hungry Hippos board game because the hippo opens and closes his mouth to eat things. This Hippo eats 3 orange playdough fish that DisneyCarToys made for him. He also eats the Disney Pixar Cars micro drifter Chick Hicks, the green race car. Hungry Hungry Hippos is made by Hasbro. The board game comes with 4 hungry hippos that eat little white plastic balls. The hippo that eats the most wins!\n\nDisneyCarToys Color Me Hungry Hippo Eating Play Doh and Learning Toy review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLinE0MG9j8\n\nPlay Doh Hungry Hungry Hippo Disney Cars Prank with Micro Drifters and Play Doh food by an Alligator toy:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iFKeshc4ek", "title": "Play Doh Hungry Hungry Hippo Eats Cars Chick Hicks Micro Drifter and Play-Doh Fish Disney", "publishedDate": "2013-08-26T15:36:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "62KuzA1CR3E", "description": "You are going to hell if you use that dessert spoon\nhttp://bit.ly/aK0RDu\n(the Church is now offering an exchange rate of three acts of paedophilia to one act of fly-tipping.)\n\nThis is what I think - http://j.mp/cRcIPW", "title": "CHILD ABUSE IS THE SAME AS USING THE WRONG CUTLERY", "publishedDate": "2010-07-16T20:06:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "62KvcwJ94R8", "description": "This was confirmed as Ips calligraphis engraver beetle.

In this short video I am going to show you the easiest way to manually spin articles with Spin Rewriter. This way you have absolute control over what happens with your articles.\n\nYou can manually spin your articles on sentence and paragraph level in step 1. After you enter your article, make sure that you have the sentence and paragraph level spinning enabled.  Then, highlight any sentence or paragraph and you will see this popup window. You can enter different variations of your sentences and paragraphs here. To add more variations, simply click here. And when you are done, click this button.\n\nTo manually spin individual words of your article, click this button. Spin Rewriter will analyze the exact meaning of all words in your original article and prepare a list of thousands of the most appropriate synonyms for those words. Then, to see the list of suggested synonyms of a particular word, you can simply double click it. If this word has more than one meaning, you can find a list of all available meanings on the right and you can easily switch between them.  However, Spin Rewriter is intelligent enough to automatically select the correct meaning for you so you don't have to do the hard work. To use a particular synonym of the original word, you can simply click it. You can use this button to quickly select only the top synonyms -- these top synonyms are pre-selected by Spin Rewriter so, again, you don't have to waste any of your precious time on this. With this button here, you can quickly select all synonyms -- if you want to make sure that your articles are spun as thoroughly as possible, and you don't mind compromising a bit on the readability. You can also add your very own, new synonyms. Just type them in here and press enter.\n\nOnce you're satisfied with the selected synonyms of this particular word, you can apply the exact same synonyms to all occurrences of this same word with the exact same meaning in the entire article. To do this, simply click this button. This is a huge time saver as well!\n\nYou might want to rewrite whole phrases as well. To select a phrase, just highlight it with your mouse. Everything else is exactly the same and you'll be done in seconds. \nYou can also enter the \"fast mode\" by clicking here. In the fast mode, you can quickly navigate through the text with the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. \n\nWhen you are done selecting the best synonyms for your original words and phrases, simply click this button to finalize your article and you'll be ready to start creating hundreds of high quality unique versions of your original article in seconds.\n\nThank you for watching!

Basically, the process involves documenting the composition of those ancient rock layers and finding out what environments in our modern world produce sediment of similar composition.Today, geologists can observe rain, ice, and wind eroding mountains and carrying the debris, called sediment, down rivers, streams, and glaciers to be deposited across floodplains, lakes, desert valleys, and ocean basins. Geologists can then document the kinds of sediment, such as sand, silt, and clay that are deposited in layers within each of these environmental settings and compare them to the kinds of rock layers, such as sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, found in ancient rock sequences containing dinosaurs. Thus, observing present geologic processes is an important key to understanding past geologic environments, and dinosaur fossils can only be preserved where sediments are deposited that can quickly bury the skeletons and begin the processes of fossilization.Such studies have revealed that most of the dinosaurs we have found lived along ancient rivers or streams and roamed across the adjacent forested floodplains and densely vegetated swamps and lakes. Some discoveries have also shown that dinosaurs inhabited ancient deserts strewn with fields of sand dunes, and dinosaur skeletons have also been found along the sandy shorelines of ancient seas. Sediments representing mountainous environments are fairly rare, since erosion and not deposition is more common in these habitats. So examples of mountain-dwelling dinosaurs are also rare. Although a few dinosaur skeletons have been found in marine sediments, especially ones deposited near the shoreline, no dinosaurs have been documented to actually live in the oceans, and these rare skeletons in marine sediments appear to represent carcasses, carried by river currents, that floated out to sea before sinking to the bottom.", "title": "In what kind of environments did dinosaurs live?", "publishedDate": "2012-12-03T17:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "62Zkq1kKJMg", "description": "Britney Spears' father wants more money to watch over her.\n\nFor the latest celebrity news, check out: www.hollyscoop.com\nLike Us on Facebook!: http://facebook.com/hollyscoop\nFollow Us On Twitter!: https://twitter.com/Hollyscoop\nCheck Us Out on Instagram!: http://instagram.com/hollyscooptv", "title": "Britney Spears' Father Wants More Money as Conservator", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T21:28:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "62_1-Ypuvkk", "description": "Video is copyright of The Weather Channel 2013.

Das Problem ist allerdings, dass ich inzwischen jeden Tag an die 150 derartige Mails mit allgemeinen Fragen aus der ganzen Welt bekomme... (\"welche Epiphone kannst Du empfehlen..., \"...was ist der Unterschied zwischen einer Custom-Shop-Les-Paul und einer normalen...\", \"..welche Strat-Pickups soll ich in meine Road-Worn einbauen\", \"..was ist der Unterschied zwischen einer Vintage-Fender/Gibson und einer Reissue ..\".\nIch habe jetzt eine ganze Zeit jeden Tag solche Mails beantwortet - und im Einzelfall w\u00e4re dies auch kein Problem. Aber, sorry, in diesem Umfang geht das leider nicht mehr! Nehmt es also bitte nicht pers\u00f6nlich wenn ich solche allgemeinen Fragen ab jetzt deshalb grunds\u00e4tzlich nicht beantworte!

It's a game about filling the screen with mechanical nasties and unleashing you upon them -- body slamming, punching, shooting and detonating anything you encounter.\n\nIt pitches itself as dumb fun, a message underscored by the chaos of four-player co-op, a huge number of daft unlockable items and the sort of brainless ribaldry that revels in burping, boozing and firing missiles shaped like garden gnomes. This deluge of silliness campaigns against sour-faced criticism: hey man, it says, you can't stay angry at someone wearing a Viking hat and golfing trousers. Gizza hug, grumpy bear.\nWell, as it happens, I'm pretty good at staying angry at things, particularly things which try to make me sign up for a Facebook plugin when they launch, unless disabled in the settings menu. And while we're talking about usability, why do you have to drop back to the main menu to invite people into your game? And you'd think they might have fitted in gamepad support somewhere, too.\n\nLuckily for my weathered stressball, the game underneath mostly delivers on its promise of cathartic, frivolous carnage, with no small thanks due to the art and its weighty, goonish sense of caricature. On the battlefield, frantic gunfire rattles through wave upon wave of adorable chainsaw-wielding robo-spiders, turning their heaving numbers into a tinny percussion set.\n\nYour character is nimble, when the nigglesome level geometry permits, double-jumping over charging foes, pummelling their vulnerable backs with bullets. Other enemies fire rockets that must be punched back the way they came. Dealing with such tricky customers while keeping the waves of chainsaws at bay is a pleasantly fraught challenge, enhanced by flying menaces, homing missiles and grenades.\nYour armoury isn't too shabby either: the main impetus of the game is to scoop up the shattered components of fallen enemies and trade them in for better weapons, backpacks and amusing hats. The buffs behind each have been cleverly considered, and their irreverent, often nonsensical descriptions are a pretty witty send-up of the traditional stat screen.\n\nThis consumer-collector impulse is necessary, however, given the lacklustre progress of the levels. There aren't quite enough interesting enemy types, or tactics to defeat them, and the set-pieces -- boss battles and survival levels -- are tortuous and lacking in ingenuity. The otherwise punchy action is also slightly sullied by minor collision issues, which get worse with online lag, and the occasional foibles of the camera as it struggles to keep players on screen.

Pick up any major newspaper and many periodicals and there are plastic surgeon's advertising their vaginoplasty services.\n\nSome of these surgeries, such as removal of labia are considered medieval and in some countries there is outraged that young girls are forced to undergo such procedures. Yet women in more modern countries seem to think it is the answer to their vaginal prayers.\n\nWhy Do Women Have Vaginal Rejuvenation Surgery?\n\nWhy does a surgery that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state has not been proven to result in vaginal tightening have women still flocking to their doctor's offices in droves?\n\nThe most common reason women have vaginal tightening surgery is obviously because they are unhappy with the way their vaginal looks or feels. For many women, this is due to vaginal changes that occur from giving birth, especially multiple times. Having vaginal tightening surgery that takes care of this issue for them can seem like something to put in the pro column when thinking about this issue.\n\nIf you;re looking for a natural way to tighten your vagina, we advise you to check out Venus Virgin Cream here - http://womensupplementsreview.com/venusvirgincream/", "title": "How To Tighten Vagina - The Best Vaginal Tightening Cream", "publishedDate": "2013-08-27T05:03:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "62oUlJhTiWo", "description": "", "title": "Anemone Heleegui HD video clip", "publishedDate": "2013-01-14T11:41:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "62oZgSn2OJ8", "description": "xianjiaren000@gmail.com ;xianjiaren@gmail.com ;QQ:695943034;phone:+0086-13680860674\nWe supply and export bletilla striata (Rhizoma Bletilla ) , please send me email or call me if you want to order.Thank you .

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\nSchool science & people science\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "magnet detector", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T07:47:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "62qSGmLrR6c", "description": "http://www.incathlab.com/EN/videos/2-endovascular/36-lower-limb-arteries-femoral-artery/618-segmental-recanalization-with-supera-stenting-of-sfa-popliteal-artery-and-recanalization-and-pta-of-tibioperoneal-trunk", "title": "TSR SEGMENTAL RECANALIZATION WITH SUPERA STENTING OF SFA & POPLITEAL ARTERY AND RECANALIZATION AND P", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T18:15:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "62qfbs6pCwE", "description": "", "title": "140117 \uc5f0\uc608\ud2b9\uc885 \uace8\ub4e0\ub514\uc2a4\ud06c \ube44\ud558\uc778\ub4dc \ub85c\uc774\ud0b4", "publishedDate": "2014-01-17T13:32:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "62qfxp7-qt8", "description": "floodgate performing  distorted at the raise the dead fest", "title": "floodgate distorted", "publishedDate": "2007-05-28T20:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "62r9_XGQZSA", "description": "People's Voice...

You can be creative in your process, but the Camel Back holder on the middle of the vest needs to be moved over to the back right side. i used some metal clips and snipped a few holes in the  back of the camel back holder. I stuck the clips to the back of the shoulder strap. If you find a better method, great! this one was the only thing i could think of. Now, im guessing a lot of ppl are wondering how to make the lenses... easy! all you need is two butter lids (I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER works perfect), and ur window film and lighting gels. cut a hole in both butter lids so the lenses can fit in. cut out 4 pieces of lighting gels that fit inside the lids. take ur window film and stick 2 of the gel pieces to it. cut the NOW reflective pieces of film/gel from the sheet. smooth out the bubbles from the lenses you just cut. place the extra plain lighting gels into the lids 1st, then put the reflective lenses in after. you shouldnt be able to see through them now. simply snap the lids into the S10 lenses and you're good to go! if anyone needs any further help... please feel free to contact me.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!!", "title": "HUNK COSTUME: HOW TO MAKE IT", "publishedDate": "2009-08-09T06:40:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "637lBUlLSF0", "description": "Enjoy the video?

The 87B features a 15 shot under barrel tube magazine and the unusual Stevens action - the bolt stays open after you fire a shot , not going forward to chamber the next round until you release the trigger.

Despite intensified dialogue since January 2012 on the possible military dimensions of the programme, there had been no agreement, said Yukiya Amano ... Mr Amano admitted on Monday that \"because of the extensive activities by Iran it may no longer be possible to find anything, even if we are given access\". These included the massive removal of soil, asphalting and possible dismantling of infrastructure, he said.

In this addition, East Durham College lecturer Della Frank shows you how to create and apply a natural nail whiting formula using products found in the kitchen.\n\nDark nail polish / varnish can often leave your nails stained, looking yellow or discolored.  Here's a super easy technique you can use at home to get your nails looking lovely and white again.\n\nThe skills displayed in this film are taught to students studying on our beauty therapy courses.\n\nIf you are interested in studying beauty therapy, please have a look at the East Durham College website http://www.eastdurham.ac.uk\nOr join us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EDCollege\nand Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EastDurhamCol\n\nV/O: Today I\u2019m going to show you a little tip as to how you can whiten your nails.\n\nQuite often they become discoloured and all I have is a little bit of bicarbonate soda in here and some pure lemon juice, we\u2019re going to mix them together. \n\nIt will froth up initially, it should be a nice paste that shouldn\u2019t drop off immediately from a spoon, so this is perfect.\n\nTake some of the paste and all we\u2019re gonna do is to massage the paste into each nail. Massage all the way around the nail plate. Mixed with the lemon juice, the citric acid in the lemon juice gives it a lovely brightening and enlightening effect, so together they\u2019re really really good.\n\nTake a little cotton wool bud, slightly dampened, give it a really good massage, work all the way through. Lemon juice also has fabulous antiseptic properties and bactericide properties so it cleanses the hands and the nails as well.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, all you're going to do then is to soak your hands into a bowl and you can either squeeze some lemon juice or if you prefer you can put a few drops of essential oil of lemon in there as well. \n\nJust add to the water and help to lighten those nails and literally dry the nails off. \n\nSoak thoroughly because you want to get the little grittiness out of the bicarbonate soda and it\u2019s just a very very quick and simple tip as to how you can whiten your nails using products within your kitchen.\n\nVideo produced by Noovo Creative.

Serving York PA. Our phone number is 717-755-5461. Our website address is http://www.wilburhenry.com/ .  \n\nHere's some things you can try to do on a clogged toilet. \n\nThe 3 most common things that clog toilets way to much toilet paper, the flushable wipes.  I know they say flushable on them. But older houses with their cast iron pipe the wipes get caught on the build up on the pipes and they will stop up your sewer lines sooner or later. \n\nSome of the things you can do is, once the clog occurs, let it sit for a couple of hours you know, three or four hours.\n\nYou can try a metal coat hanger, what I'll do is cut a coat hanger and try to bend it as long as I can and stick it up as far as I can to help break it up. The other thing you can \ndo is try flushing the toilet when it's clogged. \n\nThe more water in the bowl the more head pressure is on the clog and might help it push it out through.  If the water comes up to high you push the flapper back down as fast as you can and that will stop the flush by pushing the flapper back down. \n\nYou can try a regular plunger or go to any hardware store and try a toilet auger.\n\nHowever if you need to go to this step you may want to save yourself the time and money and call a plumber to get the issue resolved.\n\nYou also want to make sure the jets are cleaned out on you toilet.  This is especially true for people on well systems with the calcium deposits.\n\n\nThank you.", "title": "Have A Clogged Toilet? 5 Simple Steps YOU Can Do Before You Call A Plumber", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T12:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "63GeE1VKz6g", "description": "Hazel at Bards, Ballads n Bulldust night at Ancient Briton Hotel in Naseby, Central Otago.", "title": "Ancient Briton Hotel, Naseby", "publishedDate": "2006-10-09T20:22:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "63GjFRnOrJI", "description": "WordAi (Get free trial: http://goo.gl/KR8XKE; Discount info: http://goo.gl/FXNBih ) is the most advance article re-writer that uses artificial intelligence to rewrite/spin articles.

They also have vertical pupils and many small scales on the top of the head. Their fangs are also longer and more mobile than for most other elapids, although still far from the size seen in some of the true vipers. Despite their name and appearance, they are not vipers at all. This is a case of convergent evolution.\n\nThey normally take 23 years to reach adult size. Females are generally slightly larger than the males. They can also be easily distinguished from other Australian snakes because of a small, worm like lure on the end of their tail, which is used to attract prey. Most have large bands around their bodies, though the color itself is variable, depending on their locality. Colors are usually black, grey or red and yellow, but also include brown and greenish-grey.\n\nMore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_adder\n\nor http://www.reptilepark.com.au/animals.asp?catID=16&ID=106", "title": "Death Adders (Genus Acanthophis)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-08T16:02:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "63TudFk9-u8", "description": "Music video by Vivian Green performing Emotional Rollercoaster.

Strokes happen when blood flow to your brain stops. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. There are two kinds of stroke. The more common kind, called ischemic stroke, is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind, called hemorrhagic stroke, is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. \"Mini-strokes\" or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), occur when the blood supply to the brain is briefly interrupted.\n\nSymptoms of stroke are\n\n    Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)\n    Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech\n    Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\n    Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\n    Sudden severe headache with no known cause\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, you must get to a hospital quickly to begin treatment. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot or by stopping the bleeding. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Drug therapy with blood thinners is the most common treatment for stroke.\n\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke", "title": "Stroke - Causes, Symptoms and Treatment Options", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T14:06:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "63WrFoMv4vg", "description": "How to make borsht", "title": "HOW TO MAKE BORSHT", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T15:15:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "63X3jgQSFls", "description": "laffin again", "title": "SGML laffmad 2", "publishedDate": "2008-03-16T09:25:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "63XA6R2CriI", "description": "Woman on NYC Subway is scared to death of the Ebola Virus.\n\nSubscribe to OpieRadio - http://bit.ly/OpieRadioYouTube\nWebsite - http://www.opieradio.com \nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/OpieRadio\n\nSiriusXM - http://www.siriusxm.com/theopie&anthonychannel \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/opieradiofans\nGoogle+ - https://plus.google.com/103868778080957140985/\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/opieradio", "title": "Woman has Ebola scare on NYC Subway - @OpieRadio", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T17:59:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "63Xls6TDDzM", "description": "L'astuce en vid\u00e9o pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone tomb\u00e9 dans l'eau par recettes-pas-b\u00eate, expliquer pas \u00e0 pas\nMerci de mettre un j'aime \u00e0 la vid\u00e9o =)  20 j'aimes = 1 vid\u00e9o en forme :D\nRetrouvez nous sur notre page Facebook http://www.facebook.com/RecettePasBete\nhttp://recettes-pas-bete.fr/trucs.html\nhttp://recettes-pas-bete.fr/index.html\nVisitez nos sites partenaires\nhttp://www.delires-du-net.com\nRetrouvez nous sur notre page Facebook http://www.facebook.com/deliresdunet\nhttp://www.auto-ecole-bozzolo.fr", "title": "Astuce pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone tomb\u00e9 dans l'eau HD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T16:07:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "63Y5XjlO4vk", "description": "An early-at-morning thought about new idiom I did learn: Like Shoot Fish in a Barrel.\n\nFollow Flula Hier // http://www.twitter.com/flula\n\nLike Flula Hier // http://www.facebook.com/flula\n\nFlula Shop! // http://flulashop.com", "title": "Shooting Fish In The Barrel, Why Is It That?

The method that you choose largely depends on what you will be using the asparagus for. Boiling the asparagus will make it very tender and this makes it ideal for dipping or for topping soups and creamy dishes. Grilling is perfect for getting it very crispy and dry, especially if it will be served for dipping. Roasting asparagus gives it a tender-crisp texture which can be used for most dishes.

Her countenance inspires love, adoration and awe. She exudes beauty beyond description. She is patroness of the sick, protectress of the helpless, benefactress of the needy. Her miracles are numerous and are not only part of the past but continue to adorn the present. Hence so strong is the devotion her devotees have for her that wherever they may find themselves they do not fail to visit her to ask that Masses be said for them at her shrine or that candles be lighted on their behalf before her. Some send flowers to decorate her throne and others even prepare a cloak for her wear.\nOn the hilltop where the Lady of Manaoag's shrine stands up to this day, thousands continue to flock every year. Huge crowds attended the day the image was canonically crowned by the Papal Nuncio in April 21, 1926. So also during the silver jubilee celebrations in 1951. This year, 1976, Manaoag is preparing itself to receive the flocks of devotees who will come to honor her on her golden jubilee of the year. By the time that comes she shall have visited all the barrios of Manaoag, and all the towns of Pangasinan -- something she does every twenty five years.\n\nFrom the Solemn Novena in honor of Our Lady of Manaoag published by the Shrine of Our Lady of Manaoag, Manaoag, Pangasinan, Philippines.", "title": "Our Lady of Manaoag ( Ang aming Ina ng Manaoag)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T12:23:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "63_vRtRD1HU", "description": "This is the band Sarracenia, they're from Sweden.

While Fosbury never broke the world record using his new technique, other \nhigh jumpers were inspired by his gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in \nMexico City, where he introduced his new jumping technique.  \nFosbury was born in 1946 in Oregon and went to Oregon State University. He won the \ngold medal in the Olympic Games at the very young age of 21. It was assumed that his \nodd-looking new method for clearing the bar was based on a careful study of the physics \nand biomechanics of high jump technique. However, Fosbury claimed it was the product \nof pure intuition.  \nPrior to Fosbury's invention, most high jumpers used a \"straddle\" technique. In this \nolder style of jumping, the front leg led the jumper up and over the bar in a face down \nposition. Fosbury's technique involves approaching the bar in a curve with a last second \nacceleration. Then, at the point of take-off, the body rotates, positioning the back to the \nbar and leaping backwards. The head faces the sky as the body arches over the bar with \nthe mid-body and legs trailing behind.  \nFosbury had begun experimenting with the technique when he was only sixteen years \nold. In a meet in 1968 in which Fosbury used his new technique, a local newspaper's \nheadline read, \"Fosbury flops over the bar.\" Thus, the name of the newly invented \ntechnique was born.  \nSince Fosbury's competitive days, his technique has been widely copied. Once \nexperienced jumpers mastered the technique, records started to fall in the sport, due \nmostly to the Fosbury Flop, but also to better equipment and running surfaces. Dick \nFosbury will always be known for his revolutionizing of the sport of high jump.", "title": "Fosbury Flop", "publishedDate": "2012-06-01T06:00:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "63e0_pet_Gg", "description": "Each of these social innovators -- all in their 20s -- are recognized as 2010 YouthActionNet Fellows.

If the mixture is too wet of mixture causes sloppy, acrylic beads that can run into the cuticle, it will also cause excess shrinkage when acrylic hardens.

Whether you're an art worker, digital designer or photographer, a portfolio is a must have for securing any position, be it freelance or permanent. So, here are some tips on how to get it right from Mark Begley, Major Players Head of Recruitment for Creative, Design and Digital jobs.\n\nNot got time for a video? Check out the main points below...\n\nKeep it simple\n\"You don't want to bombard the reader with pages and pages of images so it's best to pick 7-12 key pieces and lay them out in a clean and simple and easy to read format.\"\n\nDon't rely on print\n\"Don't just rely on print; you could also have an online present (teaser) which you could send over in advance of an interview. Also think about bring a PowerPoint or flash presentation along with you to the interview so you can talk through your work.\"\n\nKeep it current\n\"Presenting an out of date portfolio could be a real deal breaker for your interviewer so make sure yours is current and tailored to the agency your visiting, for example if you're seeing a consumer agency only include work relevant to them.\"\n\nBde commerically aware\n\"This is more relevant for senior creatives -- so make sure that you are aware of the commercial impact of your work on a campaign. Perhaps come with some figures to demonstrate your results.\"\n\nDrafts\n\"Include drafts, this shows the thought process for a project and also gives you ownership of it. You could even include any good alternative ideas that weren't chosen.\"\n\nState the brief\n\"Accompany each piece with a short synopsis of the brief; it will make things much clearer for the reader allowing them to interpret your work more fully it will also help if they ask you to discuss the work itself so come prepared.\"\nWant you brush up your creative CV too?

They understand that certain trace minerals can be absorbed more efficiently to meet the biological and nutritional needs of their livestock.  Through this efficient absorption, animals will generally be healthier, build muscle faster, and have better structural integrity of bones, fish scales, footpads, and hooves.  On the other hand, inorganic trace minerals are absorbed less efficiently.  When animals are fed excessive amounts of trace minerals that they can't absorb, the minerals simply pass through the animal and are excreted into the environment.  In addition, excessive trace mineral supplementation can inhibit the absorption of other essential trace minerals and nutrients.\n\nNot only is this a waste of money for producers, nutritionists, and veterinarians, but it leads to other unwanted conditions such as an adverse effect on soil and water quality.  In order to stay competitive and remain profitable, producers, nutritionists, veterinarians must do everything they can to maximize their return on investment by getting more meat, milk, or eggs per animal.", "title": "Chelated Trace Minerals Benefits for Nutritionists and Producers", "publishedDate": "2011-02-28T17:53:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "647VTMujTNo", "description": "Science Titan Ibrahim demonstrates and explains how to make and use a microscope made with hardware and a smartphone!\n\nChicago Math and Science Academy is a public charter school that provides its students with an innovative world class education, rich in math, science and technology focused on preparing students to become bold inquirers, problem solvers and ethical leaders, skill-ready for post-secondary education to meet the challenges of a competitive global workforce.\n\nWalk through the doors of our school and you would feel a palpable sense of something unique and strong.

Over the last 30 years or so it has still been a topic of shame and skepticism even for those of us who have it. This piece explores transformation and enlightenment to this ultimately powerful gift of a heightened level of perception. As seasoned sailors before me know, the ocean is one of the few places our senses are truly heightened, like anechoic chamber of silence. Similarly to this, one can begin to have a sensory experience, hallucinating and devising a life's narrative which drive and shape us, whether it be inspired by the madness of perception, love, loss of family, or the obsessive need to create art. As we re-live our sense memories we chose which senses we decide to turn off at will to survive, and which parts of us we must follow and be true to. \n\nTo donate funds to this project from $1 and up please go to www.usaprojects.org\n\nCollaborators:\n\nThe Dramaturg is Noreen C.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I'm sitting here with the Taylor Parlor guitar. I love Parlor\nguitars, because they're quite small and very easy to hold. They cuddle in\nyour arms like a beautiful woman. So, this guitar has a spruce top. It's\ngot an ebony finger board, so it's quite a bright sound. But to top that\noff, it's got Madagascar rosewood back, and rosewood sides. So, this\nguitar, this little baby, is a real beauty. Now, the price of this guitar\nranges about $4,000. [Music] Well worth the price. I'm going to have my\nfriend Dave, talk about the expression system that's unique to the Taylor\nguitars; the expression system which I like so much, because it gives you\nsuch a beautiful, balanced sound; and I'm going to plug in the guitar right\nnow, to demonstrate that.\n\nDave: [starts mid recording] humbugging pickup with one coil here. That's\nthe pickup. The other side, that's the hum cancelling coil, the dummy coil.\nSo, most of the pickup is coming from this magnetic pickup under the neck.\nActually, this is an older revision of the system that has only one sensor.\nBut the sensor is a coil immersed in hydraulic liquid and as the top\nvibrates, the coil moves around and picks up the vibration of the top, sort\nof like a microphone. It's really resistant to feedback. This is a string\nground, a few string grounds. If some shock came through the system, that\nwould pop the fuse instead of electrocuting you. And, that's it. That's how\nit works, the preamp up here - volume, base and treble.\n\nA: Very nice.\n\nDave: Yeah.\n\nA: Thank you. All right, I've plugged the guitar in; the plug goes down in\nat the tail. The volume and tones are right up here, very easily\naccessible.\n\n[Music]", "title": "Taylor Parlor Guitar Review", "publishedDate": "2011-06-29T13:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "64k5THdC64s", "description": "An excerpt from the 8/03/10 Giant Bombcast that I animated.", "title": "Giant Bombcast Animated! - Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh", "publishedDate": "2010-09-04T21:28:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "64kCKwlKaWQ", "description": "Top 10 Largest Companies by Revenue\n\n10.

Over 70% of the average household's energy use goes into space and water heating, so a free source of hot water can make a dramatic financial saving. \n\nA solar thermal water heating system consists of three main parts: now lets take a look at the process step by step. An evacuated solar collector is fitted to the roof to absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to the fluid in the solar circuit pipes. The solar circuit transports the hot fluid from the collectors to the hot water cylinder, the hot water cylinder receives the hot fluid and transfers the heat to the domestic hot water supply. \n\nOf the many benefits resulting from the installation of a solar thermal hot water heating system, the three biggest ones are as follows:\n\n1. An immediate saving on hot water bills\n2. The extended life of your boiler by up to 60%, having reduced the amount of heavy work required to heat your hot water\n3. Long term financial reward from the tax-free income proposed by the government's renewal heat incentive scheme. \n\n#end of transcription#\n\nTo find out more about solar pv and how it can help you save money - and the world, visit us http://www.tecg.co.uk.

I'm Lorie Marrero and today's Clutter Video Tip is about guest rooms.  I'm sitting in my own guestroom where we just had [POP] guests this weekend.  I just took the sheets off the bed to wash them and I was thinking I want to share with you a couple of things we use to help our guestroom feel a little more organized and our guests to feel more comfortable.  One thing is this shoebox full of forgotten items.  [POP] This we have in the cabinet with the towels, so our guests don't even have to ask us for anything.  If they forgot something they can just grab what they need.  Something like, a toothbrush or some razors.  We also have in here a cute little deodorant, we have some Q-tips and band-aids and hairspray and shaving cream, or course, and floss.  And there are many other things I'm sure you can think of to put in here.  But this is wonderful and the guests just are completely comfortable and have everything they need.\n\nAnother thing we do is we have a tourist binder.  So, I want to show you a few things in here.  What we keep in here is a really nice [POP] walking map of downtown, extra museum tickets in this envelope, some gift certificates for our favorite ice cream place, and we also have a Word document that we keep updated, probably once a year or so, with favorite restaurants and things to do.  And then [POP] we have clippings from local magazines about great restaurants and other things to do around town.  \n\nIf you like these tips, you can get more at our free tips page where we have our guestroom checklist on the left side of the page at clutterdiet.com/freetips.\n\nSee you next time, and may you always be happy and grateful for having more than enough.", "title": "Clutter Video Tip: Guest Room and Tourist Binder Tips", "publishedDate": "2010-11-03T17:31:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "64ocw5fYYJA", "description": "Escucha la nota completa d\u00e1ndole Click...", "title": "PELEA DE CARMEN ARISTEGUI Y LORET DE MOLA POR CASO CHAPO!!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-25T20:52:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "64oeFXayPqA", "description": "An assignment for my broadcast class.\n\nI have a blog too!\n\ndearredeyes.blogspot.com", "title": "Zuni Harvest", "publishedDate": "2010-11-06T17:28:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "64po6lMeAIw", "description": "Climbed up a barn that had burned down with my \"grapple buddy\".

After you've inked in the whole situation, you can take color pencils, pastels, wash, watercolor, whatever you want.  I'm going to do this one with some pastels, because they're really nice to shade.  So you just start out on the outside, you pick your color blocking, which this dress has a lot of color blocking in it.  With pastels less is more because they spread around the page really well.  And this might or might not be the final color that I decide to do this dress in, but it's mainly used to create color blocking, so that you could see what the final design is going to be.  \n\nI'm going to go heavy on the shoulders to show shadow, in here and here, and here I'm going to hit this with some more red.  I want to go with a paler shade of red here.  It's a very volcanic dress so far.  And we're going to go with, you know, we're going to go with red sleeves since they're in line, should be nice, actually is more of a burgundy or a wine color, excellent.  So now you take your handy dandy smudging device, and work the color in.  And by creating those lines on the outside, you automatically create shading, because now you're just drawing the color into the panels or design lines of the dress.  One thing to keep in mind with pastels is after you get done finished working with one color, if it's not in the same family, you have to use a different side of your smudge stick, otherwise you're going to turn your whole dress the same color, which you don't want.  \n\nThen you'll have to redraw the whole thing, and that's a pain.  So I have these oranges in here, I'm using just the side of my smudge stick.  Make sure you blow on it every once in a while, because that pastel is just basically powder compressed into a stick.  And I think I want to darken these a bit, because these are going to be a different color.  It really, I just love pastels, it's because it's instant gratification, it's like, damn, it's colored.  And if the pastel happens to go outside the line, it's no big deal, you can just take an eraser to it later.  I'll go in and do the skin toning later, but that is one way using pastels to color in a fashion sketch.", "title": "How to Color a Sketch | Fashion Sketching", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T12:25:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "64qHwMLGAlY", "description": "Dr. Peter Timoney covers the basics of the contagious venereal disease.", "title": "Contagious Equine Metritis Pt 2", "publishedDate": "2009-03-24T16:15:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "64qObP0FE-w", "description": "Rick Ross ft.

Your going to need light to levelup pass 20.\n\nThe word \u201cLight\u201d is used in quite a few places in Destiny, and it can get confusing at times.\n\nMotes of Light are a currency you earn with experience once you reach Level 20. At 20, you no longer gain levels normally; instead, every time you would have gained a level, you earn a Mote of Light instead.\n\nLight levels come from the Light stat on your armor, which is how you gain levels past 20. Light shows up as a stat just like any other, so you can have a piece of armor with +5 Light or +10 Light. You can see exactly how much Light you need to earn another Light level by moving the cursor over your Light stat.\n\nOrbs of Light grant super meter energy. These are created when a Guardian kills an enemy with a super move, or when a Defender Titan absorbs damage with the Ward of Dawn. Note that you cannot see your own Orbs of Light; only other Guardians can see and pick them up. If you killed several enemies with a super move and saw the message that you generated Orbs of Light and couldn't figure out what or where they were, that\u2019s why!\n\nLight as a concept is the literal energy granted by the Traveler to the Guardians. The Ghosts are a manifestation of this energy, as are many of the superhuman abilities that Guardians can perform.\n\nWelcome to Destiny Walkthrough Gameplay lets play and playthrough which will also include a Review, all Chapters, Missions and the Ending.

Long ago, it breathed new life into our system. Rain washed over Mars. Fresh air cleansed the skies over Venus. Soon after, humanity raced into the black, and colonized these newly remade worlds. It was a time of miracles -- a great Golden Age.\n\nIt did not last. The Traveler had an ancient enemy. A powerful darkness that found us here on Earth, and nearly destroyed us. No one knows exactly what happened in those final moments, but we know this: we survived, and we owe our lives to the Traveler.\n\nIn our darkest days, Humans, Exos, and Awoken found the Traveler where it made its last stand, low above Earth, silent and immobile. We built the City -- our last -- within its protective veil, fighting countless wars to keep its peace. From that dark age, Guardians were born.\n\nNow, a new era has begun, and the only hope for our future lies in unlocking the greatest mysteries of our past. You are a Guardian of the last safe city on Earth, able to wield some of the Traveler's incredible power. You are taking this mantle just as a new day dawns. Titans, Hunters, and Warlocks have finally returned to our long-lost worlds, only to find out we are not alone.\nDefend the last safe City on Earth. Defeat our enemies. Explore the ancient ruins of our solar system. Discover all that we have lost.

It's 80 feet tall, 330 feet wide, 25,000 square feet.

The rate for a four-week advertising blitz is $2.5 million, according to the New York Times.\n\nCoghlan added, \"It's the most beautiful display here in the square. It's the biggest in the square. The biggest digital advertisement display in the world.

He graduated in arts and law with distinction from the Punjab University. He was awarded PhD by the Punjab University in 1986 on the thesis Punishments in Islam, their classification and philosophy. He took allegiance at the hand of Sayyidina Tahir Ala-ud-Din al-Qadri al-Gilani who groomed him in the mystic way of life and who is his spiritual benefactor. Among his teachers are included his father Dr Farid-ul-Din Qadri, Mawlana Zia-ud-Din Madani, Mawlana Ahmad Saeed Kazmi, Dr Burhan Ahmad Farooqi, Dr Muhammad bin Alawi, all men of high intellectual calibre and scholarly stature. He has delivered thousands of lectures spanning diverse facets of Islam, its religious, spiritual, historical, moral, legal, political, economic, social and scientific aspects and its comparison with other religions. He also delivers lectures at foreign universities on various intellectual and contemporary issues. He has written numerous books in Urdu, English and Arabic to date. Many of his books have been translated into different languages. His lectures are also broadcast from different TV channels in the Western and Arabian world.\n\nMinhaj-ul-Quran International launched by him is thriving now in more than 80 countries of the world. He also laid the foundation of mass education programme (MEP) in Pakistan, which is the greatest educational plan at the unofficial level. His political party, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), is playing a vital role in national politics by promoting the tradition of tolerance, principle observance and progressiveness in national political culture. He is a unifying symbol of Muslim world and known as an ambassador of peace and human welfare. His intellectual and social contributions to human progress are internationally acknowledged. American Biographical Institute has pronounced him outstanding man of the 20th century and his name has been included in the Millennium Biographical Dictionary as a distinguished intellectual and thinker of the world. Moreover, he is also included among the 500 most effective leaders at the end of the second millennium as recognition of his original research and services to humanity. He was declared 1998-99 personality by the International Biographical Centre, Cambridge as an acknowledgement of his educational and social contributions. In the recent past it is hard to find an individual who has rendered such unprecedented services in such a short span of time for the improvement of the Islamic community through his intellectual and practical struggle.\n\nDr Qadri is, therefore, not an individual but a tradition.

Vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus) in Kruger National Park, South Africa, have become a major pest at tourist sites by stealing food and even attacking visitors. To better inform this primate-human conflict, we sought to examine in-camp vervet habituation and the culturally accepted notion that vervets are more fearful of males than female humans.  By measuring vervet flight initiation distances to human approach we found that vervets were significantly more fearful of males than females. We also found that in-camp vervet populations were significantly less fearful than out-of-camp populations. The high levels of habituation that we observed in multiple Kruger National Park rest camps and the lack of fear expressed by the vervets towards women highlight the danger that these habituated populations pose to both tourists and staff.  Additionally, we explored the use of non-lethal pepper ball shooting as a control strategy and found it ineffective in associating an entire area with a danger. Despite that, it did have some success in decreasing vervet visitation immediately after the five-day shooting period. We also explore other deterrent strategies employed by park staff and suggest initial steps towards mitigating primate-human conflict. This is a human-created problem and Kruger National Park must combine strict management with a consistent deterrence strategy in order to mitigate potential future conflict and to deter current problem populations.", "title": "Vervet Monkeys of Kruger National Park", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T14:47:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "65FLHn_cObI", "description": "Pri\u00e8re \u00e0 YHWH (L'Eternel) Notre P\u00e8re provenant des manuscrits retrouv\u00e9s de l'Evangile de Matthieu r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en H\u00e9breu.\nsource internet :\nhttp://www.aprayertoourfather.com/learn-the-avinu-prayer-in-hebrew/", "title": "Pri\u00e8re \u00e0 YHWH (L'Eternel) Notre P\u00e8re en H\u00e9breu chant\u00e9e par Andrew Hodkinson", "publishedDate": "2011-12-20T17:55:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "65FLJibH1Aw", "description": "This a song from my most recent recording sessions.

The Indian state of West Bengal lies to the south.\n\nWith around 607,000 inhabitants as of 2011, Sikkim is the least populous state in India and the second-smallest state after Goa in total area, covering approximately 7,096 km2 (2,740 sq mi). Sikkim is nonetheless geographically diverse due to its location in the Himalayas; the climate ranges from subtropical to high alpine, and Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak, is located on Sikkim's border with Nepal. Sikkim is a popular tourist destination, owing to its culture, scenery and biodiversity. It also has the only open land border between India and China. Sikkim's capital and largest city is Gangtok.\n\nAccording to legend, the Buddhist saint Guru Rinpoche visited Sikkim in the 8th century AD, introduced Buddhism and foretold the era of the monarchy. Sikkim's Namgyal dynasty was established in 1642. Over the next 150 years, the kingdom witnessed frequent raids and territorial losses to Nepalese invaders. In the 19th century, it allied itself with the British rulers of India, but was soon annexed by them. Later, Sikkim became a British protectorate, before merging with India following a referendum on abolishing the monarchy in 1975.\n\nSikkim is the only state in India with an ethnic Nepali majority. Sikkim has 11 official languages: Nepali (which is its lingua franca), Bhutia, Lepcha, Limbu, Newari, Rai, Gurung, Mangar, Sherpa, Tamang and Sunwar. English is taught in schools and used in government documents. The predominant religions are Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism. Sikkim's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and tourism, and as of 2011 the state has the fourth-smallest GDP among Indian states, although it is also among the fastest-growing.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

So we drove out an 90 min outside of downtown Halifax to Hirtle Beach. This is located pretty much in the middle between Lunenburg & Bridgewater.\n\nThe beach is maintained by the municipality of Lunenburg and the parking lot can accommodate about 40-50 cars. Best to arrive early on a really hot day.\n\nWe arrived at 9am and our temperature gauge displayed 17C, down almost 10 degrees from the mainland. We timed out visit well, so that we could walk along the sandy beach. High tide will make the walk a bit more difficult due to the beach stones.\n\nWe walked down the beach for about 2km, until we arrive at Gaff Point and headed for the tree line to start the hiking trail. This area is under a conservation program to protect a certain amount of coastline. The walking trail starts up the middle, the a lovely loop trail along the shoreline.\n\nWe did the trail clockwise and  enjoyed a well maintained terrain which changed as we got closer to the shoreline. A segment is hikes along the tilted shale rock which appear to be sticking up. The total hike was 6.4kms.\n\nOnce we got back to the car, it was a warm 21C, perfect to enjoy some lunch at the beach.\n\nExpected the take about 2-3 hours to fully enjoy your visit. Keep your pets on a leash when hiking the trail as you will be walking along the edge of significant cliffs.\n\nNicolas Bustos - My Electricity (The Gathering Cover) [Instrumental] by slackerpo is licensed under a  Creative Commons Licence.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/slackerpo/nicolas-bustos-my-electricity\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSubscribe on YouTube (new video every Sunday!) http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thecyr\n\nGoogle+: http://profiles.google.com/jimcyr\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/thecyr\n\nCheck out more videos from the gang at http://avoidingchores.com\n\nThanks to our supporters\n\nhttp://www.inreachcanada.com/\nhttp://delorme.com\nhttp://www.keenfootwear.com/ca\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAvoiding Chores is a collection of interests from a group of guys who do everything possible NOT to do chores.

Proposal is simple: introduce 5/10 tax system in the economy of UKRAINE!\n\nKiev 2014: Golden Cow As a Symbol of Balashov 5/10\n\nCREATED: June 12-th 2014, Kiev, UKRAINE.\nTAGS:\nUkraine, \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435, life in Ukraine, \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b, peculators, Kiev, Kyiv, Theatre, Maidan, Independence, market, Street, \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a, \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c, \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a, \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440, \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432,   Kiev, UKRAINE,  Kyiv, Theatre, Maidan, \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a, \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c, \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a, \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440, \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439, \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0438, \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c, \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b, Ukraine, Kiev, Kyiv, Theatre, Maidan, Independence, market, \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a, \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c, \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a, \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440,  \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439, \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0438, \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c, \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b,   \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b, peculators, corruption,  Opera, Theatre, monument, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f,  Maidan, celestial hundred, heavenly hundred, \u041d\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044f,  \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430, entomology, entomologist,  Shevchenko park, University, \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432, welcome, \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d, \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435, economy, Balashov, corruption, economic, 5.10, reforms, claims, \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b, peculators, \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435, \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435, cow,  cattle, ax, taxes, peculator, peculators, \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435, life in Ukraine, Miami, Beach, rich, oligarkhs, \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430, \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0441, war, crisis,\n\nMVI 6735 UKraine Kiev MAIDAN Institutska \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044c\u044e1 89\n\nSUBSCRIBE to MY CHANNEL = http://www.youtube.com/user/ufensia/featured \n\nRed Cow 5.10 - Surprised?

The comic legend is as sharp as ever and isn't running out of ideas any time soon. In fact, he is still creating superheros! And his newest creation to make it to the big screen will be called The Annihilator. The Annihilator's story begins with a Chinese expatriate named Ming, who is faced with the decision to either stay as a prisioner or join a US super soldier program that manipulate genetic enhancements from animal species. Of course, Ming enlists and goes through a unique genetic procedure, which he barely survives, yielding him with all of these amazing abilities. And of course we will see him use these enhancements to go up against one of those pesky villain types. Looking at some of the initial artwork, the look of The Annihilator is actually familiar to many of the heros we have seen before. Actually, if Wolverine was of Asian decent, and spent a little more time manscaping, he might be Ming's long lost brother, right? So far, there are some pretty big names working on the project including Bourne Legacy writer, Dan Gilroy as well as Bones and Enchanted producer, Barry Josephson. Stan Lee is excited about doing the project for his Chinese fans, and he has high hopes about the storyline saying quote \" Dan's story and character is unlike anything I have developed before, so I wait with intrigue as we begin to reveal more details about the Annihilator franchise and to hear what audiences think as they immerse themseves into his world through the film. So, we have to ask you all about your thoughts on The Annihilator! Do you like what you hear so far about the plot? And who do you think should star as Ming!?!?

With that said, it makes sense that our body needs building blocks to work with while we sleep. This is why Optimum nutrition developed gold standard 100% casein. Let's take a look at the label.\nLooks like the typical Optimum Nutrition Tub. Here we see that it provides 24 grams of protein, 10 grams of bcaas and glutamine precursers, and 0 sugars. It says that it's a slow digesting protein enhanced with aminogen. So far so good, let's see what real consumers have been saying about this supplement, time for some social proof.\nReported pros\n- No longer hungry when waking up\n- Improves recovery\n- Helps build muscle\n- Less sore the next day\nReported cons\n- Doesn't mix that well\n- Slightly gritty\n- A tad pricey\n- Becomes thick if it sits\nSo far it looks to be quite effective. As for the ratings, here we see that bodybuilding.com has a massive 1841 ratings scoring a very solid 8.7. Supplementreviews.com provides us with 134 ratings scoring a similar 8.8. This gives us a total of 1975 scoring a very nice 8.71. This supplement seems to be very effective, let's see what the active ingredients are all about.\n\nMicellar Casein (33 grams)\n- This provides you with 24 grams of protein and a long list of amino acids\n- This is a slowly digested protein which provides a consistent drip of nutrients to the body. \n- Extracted via the method of ultra-filtration of milk, this protein is a concentrated form of milk protein in combination with whey protein.\n- The ratio of whey and casein is 20:80 when extracted as a concentrate of milk. \n- This form of protein is easily absorbed and digested by the body to release instant energy; therefore, it is widely used by athletes and bodybuilders.\n- One of the important benefits of micellar casein is its ability to control the formation of Cortisol that is induced due to stress. \n- This helps reduce stress due to heavy workouts and provides mental strength for enhanced focus and concentration.\n- Because casein contains various kinds of proteins, it is highly efficient for endurance while weight lifting.\n- It helps provide maximum energy to avoid fatigue and to recover faster.\nAminogen\n- A plant enzyme thought to help absorb protein in the body (which is needed for healthy lean muscle mass, strength and energy)\nFinal Verdict\nIt seems quite clear that optimum 100% casein is very effective for the masses. The user can expect:\n- Quicker recovery\n- Increased endurance\n- Faster muscle gains\nHowever, there are some draw backs to consider, they include:\n- Doesn't mix that well\n- A little gritty\n- A bit pricey\nIf you'd like to know when optimum 100% casein goes on special, visit rawmusclegain.com and sign up using our form. We will then email you when 100% casein or any of your favorite supplements has a substantial promotion.

A decimal number can be also used to describe a fraction out of 100.c\u00a0You can change a percent into a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left.\u00a01. For example, begin with 25%.\u00a02. If there is no decimal shown, you can insert it at the end of the whole number to make it 25.0%.\u00a03. To remove the percent, move the decimal point to the left twice. This makes 0.25, which is the decimal form of the percent.\u00a0If you have a larger percent, such as 314.2%, move the decimal point over two places. This will become 3.142.\u00a0After you have converted the percent to a decimal number, you can convert it back to a percent by moving the decimal point\u00a0two places\u00a0to the right (or by multiplying the number by 100).c\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-convert-percents-to-decimals/", "title": "How to Convert Percents to Decimals", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T18:53:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "6693eG7mBOY", "description": "This is yet another blackhead extraction from nose video, there are a lot of comedones on the nose of the patient.

Finalists are displayed in an exhibition at the Gallery (although in the early years all entrants were hung). Although it is a non-acquisitive prize, several of the entries are now part of the Gallery's collection.\n\nThe Archibald Prize was first awarded in 1921.
