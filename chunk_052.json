It is an S-type asteroid approximately 34.4\u00d711.2\u00d711.2 km in size, the second-largest near-Earth asteroid (NEA) after 1036 Ganymed, belonging to the Amors. It is a Mars-crosser asteroid and was the first asteroid that was known to come within the orbit of Mars. Eros is one of the few NEAs with a maximum diameter greater than 10 km. It is believed to be larger than the impactor that created Chicxulub Crater in the Yucat\u00e1n, which has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs\n\nEros was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker probe, which orbited it, taking extensive photographs of its surface, and, on February 12, 2001, at the end of its mission, landed on the asteroid's surface using its maneuvering jets.\n\nObjects in an orbit like Eros can exist for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is perturbed by gravitational interactions.

I am pretty sure that the author would never advise dealing the same way with a cheating wife too.\n\nLet me show you an excerpt from the report that was published on Mail Online on April 9, 2014:\n\nWant to win back a cheating husband? Then YOU must eat humble pie: The most unexpected relationship advice you'll ever read\n\nBy ANDREW G MARSHALL\n\nPUBLISHED: 22:05 GMT, 9 April 2014 | UPDATED: 22:59 GMT, 9 April 2014\n\nThey're the words no woman ever wants to hear. In 30 years of relationship counselling I've worked with around 2,000 couples and I've learned the most common reason a husband tells his wife he doesn't love her any more is because there's 'another woman'.\nDiscovering that your husband has fallen out of love with you or is 'involved' with someone else is  simply horrible.\n\nYour heart races, it feels like a bag of cement is lodged in your stomach and your mind starts working overtime.\n\nWhy is he doing this, you ask? You've been a loyal and supportive wife, after all. He's got a lovely home and children who adore him. What more could he want?\n\nOf course you're not perfect -- who is? But you're not the one sending inappropriate texts to another woman. You're just trying to hold the family together. If only he'd grow up and start acting his age.\n\nAny woman who finds herself in this situation has my sympathy. Though there is always hope, the weeks and months ahead are going to be really tough. But while it might surprise you, the person whose behavior needs to change first is...\u2009you.\n\nRead More: dailymail.co.uk\n\nIf you go and read the comments below the article, you will be able to gauge the magnitude of rejection that the author received for writing what he did.\n\nNext the author in the name of giving his own brand of relationship advice, goes on explaining how even though he is cheating but SHE should apologize. He is assuming that it must have been due to her nagging, brooding or complaining habits. It's for these that she should apologize.\n\nHow can he assume so? Does no man ever turn a cheating husband whose wife doesn't nag, brood or complain? Even a cheating wife does not really have any concrete reasons to turn into one. In fact, the reality is that nagging or no nagging do not have any connection with infidelity in marriage on the part of a cheating husband or even of a cheating wife.\n\nThe real fact is that there is a basic contradiction between the inherent human nature and the controlling regime of the institution called marriage. Biologically, as animals, and psychologically, as homo-sapiens, we are designed not as monogamist (or even as polygamist) creatures; but as Wilhelm Reich once pointed out, we as a species are serial monogamists. We need a change of intimate interaction after a certain gap of time in our life.\n\nWhat marriage does is that it expects us to remain loyal monogamists all through our life with one single person to interact with at the level of a close intimacy. But that's not what we are made like. Almost all of us keep having mental sex with so many fair sex partners inside our minds. No one can deny this fact. And the ones who get a real chance to do so, get swayed by its irresistibly strong currents.\n\nThis is no relationship advice, it's only stating the facts the way they are.\n\nWhat to do? How to avoid having a cheating husband or else a cheating wife?\n\nI think we cannot avoid it any more than our strict social regimentation is doing right now at the moment in the most advanced nations on the planet. We cannot follow the examples of a few undemocratic countries that have provisions for severe punishments in the courts of law for any such violations of the marriage codes. And the fact is that such violations are way more in those countries than their more liberal counterparts!\n\nSo the best relationship advice is giving space to your partner as well as getting space from them. Be natural in your interactions with the fair sex without hiding it from your partner or without turning possessive about them. If you are not possessive, your partner is not going to run away from you. But if you are, they may!\n\nLet's accept the truth and embrace it.\n\nIs it possible for our psyche to absorb this truth and ingest it well?", "title": "Relationship Advice to Deal with A Cheating Wife or A Cheating Husband", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T05:03:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EKCp8_qlf0", "description": "Airing on BBC4 Monday July 23rd at 10pm and the opening film of the East End Film Festival on July 3rd this BBC Arena / Other Voices co-production with exclusive concert and archive footage, highlights Amy's unique talent and explores her deep affection for jazz, soul and gospel.", "title": "Arena: Amy Winehouse - The Day She Came to Dingle", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T17:46:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EKJWc0cotk", "description": "http://www.equilibriointerior.com\nTratamento de Merecimento de Louise Hay\nIdeal se praticado durante 21 dias consecutivos.\n\nSou Merecedor.

Using water from this source provides us with the only chance at saving cities like New York and countless others, which are situated at or near sea level.  It is my suggestion that we encourage persons, businesses and governments to use water from this source without restriction.  In fact, we would encourage use in every conceivable way bordering on abandon.  We would use desalinized water for everything.  This would include drinking, animal production, farming, manufacturing processes, watering our lawns and gardens, etc.  We should take the concepts that The Romans developed and expand on it globally to build a network of aqueducts worldwide, where appropriate.  The aqueducts can refill lakes, streams and aquifers that have become depleted from continued over-extraction.  These aqueducts can be powered by pumps that are serviced by solar panels and corkscrew wind vane power generators alongside of the aqueducts.  If we can pump oil across Alaska then we can certainly pump water to all of the inhabited regions of the Earth.  This would relieve the stress on nations that are in traditionally arid regions.  Approximately one-third of the worlds population lives in countries with moderate to high water stress.  Consider that this can be solved by the provision of desalinized water to all populations.  However, even if every country built these plants and used the water for merely just those purposes mentioned above the reduction in sea levels might remain relatively unaffected or possibly even continue to rise.  The next section offers the solution to considerable water usage to draw down the impending rise of oceanic sea levels.", "title": "If Earth Could Speak: Global Water Stress", "publishedDate": "2008-12-02T22:08:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ESPvZzhDS8", "description": "Infliction of Need playing their kick ass songe Zombies at music at the mall march 1st", "title": "Infliction of Need - Zombies", "publishedDate": "2008-03-02T19:10:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ESfdqTB0OU", "description": "Keep your Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto\u00ae Coffee machine in tip top condition by learning the easy way to descale it using our Liquid Water Descaler: http://bit.ly/R8EObg\n\nDescaling your coffee machine every 3-4 months gets rid of the build up of limescale and will help to lengthen your machine's life-span.

Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he's pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy named Marie (Franka Potente) ten thousand dollars for a ride to Paris. Encountering more professional killers bent on his destruction, Bourne discovers that he possesses a surprising degree of skill in combat, martial arts, and linguistics -- handy talents that clearly indicate his past includes work as a spy and assassin, but for whom? With Marie's reluctant help, Bourne edges closer to the truth, something CIA officials want concealed at all costs. The Bourne Identity co-stars Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.\n\n\"the bourne identity\",\"the bourne identity clip\",\"the bourne identity part 1\",\"the bourne identity ending\",\"matt damon\",\"franka potente\",\"car videos\",\"motorcycle videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"spy action adventure\",\"spy thrillers\",thriller,\"frank marshall\",\"richard n gladstein\",\"david minkowski\",\"patrick crowley\",\"matthew stillman\",\"doug liman\",\"andrew r tennenbaum\",\"robert ludlum\",\"risk videos\",\"survival videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262376,/m/0169dl,/m/02c23m", "title": "The Bourne Identity (8/10) Movie CLIP - The Paris Chase (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:36:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ETu6V0KrlI", "description": "Art\u00edculo del origen y evoluci\u00f3n del grupo armado menos popular de Colombia.

A must for any music fan who champions visceral experience and sing-along, gravel-slinging, true Rock and Roll.\n\n\"The Obvious are on FIRE\" ~ Pete Steinkopf of The Bouncing Souls, Chief Engineeer and Producer on The Obvious' debut EP, Bringing Wreck, Maybe She's Bored With It. \n\n\"She's like a female Kurt Cobain\" ~ Dan Ridenour of Chemtrail\n\n\"Bringing Wreck is a precarious downhill\ndelight filled with a savage self-awareness\nfrom a band that knows how to manipulate\npound for pound sound. Boisterous, while at\nthe same time commercially viable, Bringing\nWreck is a traditionally aimed punk record that\nis heading down the right musical path.\" \n-Jon Pfeiffer, The Aquarian\n\n\"We awaken something ancient\nin our fans, its like a revivalist tent meeting\nfeel and they pitch that energy right back at\nus in a way that only true rock and roll can\naccomplish.\" ~ Angie Sugrim\n \nAbout The Video: Don't Match showcases the long running creative and personal friendship between Dan Astorri (Lead Guitar / Vocals) and Angie Sugrim (Lead Vocals / Guitar). The two are opposites that compliment each other perfectly. Together these two are undeniable in their presence, and make a remarkable force to be reckoned with.\n \nDirector Name: Rob Vornkahl\nProducer Name: Travis Meyers, JT Habersaat\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheObviousBand/info\nMyspace: https://myspace.com/theeobvious\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheObviousAP\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/theobviousap\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/theobviousmusic\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/theobviousbringwreck\n \n \n \n***\n \nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://BlankTV.com\n \nCheck out the new merch!\nhttp://blanktv.bigcartel.com/\n \nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/blanktv\n \nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n \nUpvote us on Reddit:\nhttp://reddit.com/BlankTV", "title": "The Obvious - \"Don't Match\" Altercation Records - A BlankTV World Premiere!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T19:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EYU9c4oQl0", "description": "The Mysterious Character is \u014ctsutsuki Toneri and not Rikoudu Sennin's Brother.\nDon't Forget to Subscribe my Channel for more News of Naruto ^^\nFacebook: http://goo.gl/T3mkMX\nTwitter: http://goo.gl/oaokCe\n\nNaruto the Movie: The Last is an upcoming Japanese anime film.

Leaves are oblong-lanceolate to narrowly lanceolate, 14-28 cm long, 3-6 cm wide, minutely pustulate, otherwise usually smooth, sometimes with scattered hairs on nerves of lower surface, leaf stalk 0.5-2 cm long, ocreae tubular, usually 20-30 mm long, apex not ciliate, sometimes with a few small bristles ca. 0.5 mm long. Flowers in open racemes, sometimes in paniculate inflorescences 5-10 cm long, each flower on a jointed pedicel; tepals white or pinkish, 3-4 mm long, sometimes sparsely so, glandular punctate. Nuts dark brown to nearly back, broadly ovoid, biconvex or subtrigonous, 2-2.5 mm long, the surface glossy. Persicaria is a genus of plants in the family Polygonaceae, collectively known as smartweeds or pinkweeds. The genus was formerly included in the genus Polygonum. The genus includes both annuals and perennials. Most have terminal spikes of pink or sometimes white flowers. Most members of the genus are aggressive and/or invasive weeds, though some have been used as cover crops in the field and ornamental plants in the garden. \n\nKas/Kaas Plateau is a lateritic soil plateau on the ridge of North Western Ghats of India located to the west of Satara, Maharashtra. Kas plateau has only a shallow upper layer soil in scattered depressions and composed of exposed porous soft rock. The plateau is filled with small rivulets and ponds. The origin of its name 'Kaas' is still unclear yet this was once home to 'kaasa' plants Elaeocarpus. Probably the place got its name from the 'Kaasa' plant. Kas Plateau is recently recognised by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site.  The flora on Kas plateau consists of herbaceous plants many of them being ephemerals dotted with clumps of shrubs, memecylon being the dominant species. The floral extravaganza at Kas begins with the advent of North West monsoon. The spectacle of Kas flowers has been unfolding each year after surviving through annual grazing and burning, yet Kas is threatened by the insurgence of thousands of visitors thronging the plateau on peak flowering days. Satara is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India. The town is 2320 ft. above sea-level, near the confluence of the Krishna and its tributary river Venna. The city was the capital of the Maratha empire in the 17th century, hence one of the historical cities of Maharashtra. This city is the capital of Satara Tehsil, as well as Satara District.\n\nSource: Wikipedia & www.flowersofindia.net \n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

In the same year, the band held a session for John Peels Radio program on BBC.\n\nIn June of 1995, after the release of Vicious World (their first experimentation with many sound effects and different song structures), Tottsuan, the bands lead vocalist, committed suicide by jumping onto railroad tracks as a train was moving. Soon after, Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth took Tottsuans place during live S.O.B. performances, but in 1996, the band announced that Tottsuan had been replaced by Naoto, former bassist of rise of the dead.\n\nIn 2003, S.O.B. made a comeback with the release of Still Grind Attitude and a series of re-recorded classics with their most current vocalist Itsushi. They still exist today but are only actively known in Japan.\n\nReleased on CD with \"Leave Me Alone\" in 1993 by Toys Factory.\n\nEarly S.O.B. showed the band playing intense hardcore punk/thrash.\n\nMost lyrics are in the band's native Japanese language while some are mixed\nwith English and Japanese and very few are sung in full English.", "title": "S.O.B. - Let's Go BEach", "publishedDate": "2009-02-23T00:15:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EjEabA_BQo", "description": "The easiest way to get your perfectionist title and emblem", "title": "MW3 Perfectionist Title and Emblem Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2011-11-10T21:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EjHG-WwujQ", "description": "Liz 9.2.13", "title": "Liz's Bass Lesson -Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger-", "publishedDate": "2013-09-03T06:01:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EjHTKylk24", "description": "Alpha male markhor shows everyone whose log it is", "title": "Turkmenian Markhor", "publishedDate": "2008-06-04T05:15:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EjQSHllslg", "description": "U.S. Royalty performing \"Into The Thicket\" at the DC Gibson Guitar Showroom for Creative Mornings on October 25, 2013.", "title": "\"Into the Thicket\" - U.S. Royalty (Creative Mornings)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T19:38:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EjnGLK9hCM", "description": "", "title": "Sheepwalk!

It was a lengthy hearing, longer than most at the preliminary hearing stage, with at least eight different witnesses called to the stand including investigators, family members and the bar owner himself.\n\nEd Gawel, the owner of Edders Den Bar, in the Oakhurst neighborhood of the city, and his girlfriend testified Wednesday that they were in their car in the parking lot when the shooting happened. And they said they watched the entire thing.\n\nThey both recalled to the judge that they saw Keith Reed, whom they knew as frequent bar patron, get out of a gold-colored car before another man, alleged to be Joshua Cambric, came up to the car with a handgun and shot through the window twice and then jumped into a black SUV that sped off.\n\nPolice said the man in the driver's seat of the car, Tony Phillips, was shot and killed. The coroner said he died of a gunshot wound to the chest. Phillips' death was ruled a homicide.\n\nCambric and Reed, along with Jeremy Woodard, are facing serious charges in connection with Phillips' death.\n\nProsecutors allege all three men had met earlier in the day and conspired in the shooting. Reed is believed to have gone to Philips' home to get him before bringing him to Edders Den. Prosecutors said Woodard, who is believed to have pulled the trigger, then dropped Cambric off at the bar's parking lot.\n\nTheir defense attorneys told the judge there hasn't been enough evidence presented to identify their clients or to show that any of them committed a crime. But prosecutors said surveillance video they have, from before and after the shooting, speaks for itself.\n\n\"The video surveillance is absolutely fantastic for the commonwealth in this case,\" said Jessica Aurandt, assistant district attorney for Cambria County. \"It shows all three individuals that are charged in this case acting in accordance with one another throughout the entire incident.\"\n\n\"There's still a lot of evidence that's going to come out, a lot of suppression, a lot of different things that are going to happen,\" said Broc Jennings, who defends Reed. \"As of right now, it's getting bound over, and it might actually be a good thing.\"\n\nThe video does not show the shooting itself, but it does show three men who appear to be Cambric, Reed and Woodard acting in ways witnesses testified to.", "title": "Three men charged in deadly Johnstown shooting will stand trial", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T15:44:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EliWtNg-8c", "description": "Live pinfish was the bait in 35 feet of water off St Pete", "title": "Cobia on live pinfish", "publishedDate": "2010-10-09T18:45:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ElqkdalKCM", "description": "", "title": "Excellent Pavage Sealer asphalte repairs   line stripping   IMPERIAL TOBACCO", "publishedDate": "2014-03-13T04:38:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2EmMvMxj3PM", "description": "\u0413\u043e\u0434 : 2014\n\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 :  RD ClaN\n\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 : RD ClaN\n\u0421\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f :http://www.share.az/js6fk057xfpv/RD_ClaN_-_%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%8C_(ReMiT_&_DoNNi_STyLe).mp3.html\n\nMastering Ziq Zaq......

That craze seems to have now passed, but on the streets of London a 21-year-old Russian socialite has found a new way to express her inner Paris \u2014 by bedazzling her Mercedes-Benz with 1 million Swarovski crystals.\n\nDaria Radionova, a Russian business student, told the Daily Mail that the people who covered every part of her 2011 Mercedes CLS 350 in crystals, from the door handles to the Mercedes badges, came over from Russia and worked \"12 hours a day for two months.\" She parked the car outside of the Levin Hotel in Knightsbridge on Monday and caused quite the stir.\n\nThe diesel CLS, with its license plate reading \"BAII BYY,\" truly came alive when day turned into night, and London's lights glistened off the fancy Merc's body. There is no word regarding how much Radionova spent on the transformation (she reportedly used $33,000 worth of faux diamonds), but the Russian-born student did take offense to the Mail saying she paid \"just\" \u00a325,000 (about $41,000) for the vehicle, stating on her Facebook page that \"the car is worth more than 25k.\"\n\nWith the crystal-encrusted Mercedes' newfound fame, it's sure to be worth more than that now, and if Radionova ever decides to sell the car, she claims all proceeds will go to charity. But for now it appears she will just enjoy her creation, saying that, \"If you have the cash, why not do it?\"\n\nAnd unlike a bedazzled iPhone, a glass-covered Mercedes makes a far bigger statement \u2013 and a larger cut out of one's wallet.", "title": "Russian Women socialite coats her Mercedes in 1 million Swarovski crystals - Car in Diamonds HD!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-24T08:57:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Ep-6RJ2fpE", "description": "---LEE LA DESCRIPCI\u00d3N---\n\nEso mismo, explico un poco sus bases, como funciona, y como usarla.\n\n\nSi practicas Aikido, Qi Gong o Tai Chi, te sonar\u00e1 mas.\n\n\n\nEsto no es una frikada otaku, es real, si no busca \"Morihei Ueshiba\" aqui en Youtube (es el fundador del Aikido)\n\n\n\nSi eres un puto troll que no tiene nada que hacer, no postees, borrare los comments.\n\n\n\n\nTu eliges, creer o no creer, en su dia yo crei y me va muy bien :D\n\n\n\n\n------ATENCI\u00d3N------\n\nDebido a la avalancha de Mensajes privados, aqui dejo algunas de las paginas, en ingl\u00e9s:\n\nhttp://theteachingsofki.tripod.com/\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/theforce/vicious/\nhttp://www.geocities.com/thekiwarrior87/\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/kipower/index.htm\nhttp://kiwarriorshideout.tripod.com/index.html\n\n\nPaginas de Psi:\n\nhttp://www.psipog.net/home.html\nhttp://psipog.net/activepsy/", "title": "Como usar la energ\u00eda Ki/Chi en la vida real.", "publishedDate": "2007-11-17T13:26:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Ep2RtmlLPg", "description": "Biker runs too fast down slope and hits guard rails", "title": "Biker runs too fast down slope and hits guard rails", "publishedDate": "2013-01-20T14:40:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Epyq2XWo9Q", "description": "6/18/12: R.A.

But as a caregiver I think I speak for most of us when I say vacation is a bit of a double edged sword. No matter how wonderful a holiday away can be, part of my heart is always with the chimpanzees, missing them and wondering what's happening. And just as with any friend or loved one, it's especially wonderful to greet them upon return.\n\nWhen chimpanzees greet one another after a separation, their greetings can be strikingly similar to our own in posture, gesture, vocalization, and seemingly emotion. The chimpanzees understand much, if not all of what we say, but here at CSNW we use the chimps' gestures and vocalizations with them as much as possible. And as of their society and being good subordinate apes, we always try to greet the boss lady, Jamie, first. So on my first day back I walked into the chimp area to find Jamie and was surprised when she charged toward me, with her hair pilo-erect (standing on end). From her behavior (and well, Jamie being Jamie) I fully expected that she was going to skip the pleasantries and express her general displeasure about something with me and braced myself. But much to my surprise she stuck her lips out for a kiss!\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough to make my day, Foxie was the next person to spot me and caregiver, Keri, was able to capture her greeting me on video. But while chimpanzee greetings are much like our own, this greeting bears no resemblance to anything I could do. It's all Foxie. Which is, of course, why she is so endearing.\n\nPlease like and share this video (and don't forget to subscribe to our channel!)", "title": "Chimpanzee Foxie greets a caregiver", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T23:28:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ErFSvk0rPY", "description": "This podcast was recorded at ALT-C 2009 and features Carol Elston- a winner in the Jorum Learning & Teaching Competition.

O pai, Miguel Guarnieri, era barbeiro e m\u00fasico, e tocava flauta. A m\u00e3e, G\u00e9cia Camargo, tocava piano. O pequeno Mozart aprendeu m\u00fasica em casa.\nTeve aulas de piano a partir dos dez anos de idade com Virg\u00ednio Dias. Para este professor dedicou sua primeira composi\u00e7\u00e3o, a valsa Sonho de artista (1918). A obra foi desdenhada pelo professor, mas seu pai julgou que a obra era fruto de promissor talento, pagando sua publica\u00e7\u00e3o em 1920.\nEm 1923, Miguel Guarnieri decidiu mudar-se com a fam\u00edlia para S\u00e3o Paulo a fim de proporcionar melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de estudo da m\u00fasica ao filho. Sendo uma fam\u00edlia de poucos recursos financeiros, Guarnieri trabalhou junto com o pai na barbearia e trabalhou como pianista. At\u00e9 1925 manteve v\u00e1rios empregos, tocando em cinemas, lojas de partitura e casas de baile da cidade. Estudou piano com Ernani Braga...\nA obra musical de Camargo Guarnieri \u00e9 formada por mais de 700 obras e \u00e9 provavelmente o segundo compositor brasileiro mais executado no mundo, superado apenas por Villa-Lobos.

Its use in gestational diabetes has been limited by safety concerns. It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and has been investigated for other diseases where insulin resistance may be an important factor.

My thoughts on that aside, the gameplay looks pretty awesome.\n\nThe walkthrough in the video focuses on the Nemesis System, a gameplay mechanic where enemies remember your previous encounters with them, which is unique to each player. The orc shown in the video is called Ratbag, and is a coward that has faced Talion before, and after being defeated will come under Talion's power.\n\nHe can control other characters like Ratbag by using the mysterious powers he gains from a Wraith. There aren't details on who the Wraith is and how Talion receives these powers, but they look powerful. Activating the Wraith powers allows him to pursue enemies into Mordor, along with moving between the physical world and the Wraith world. Talion can also spread terror with Wraith powers, controlling characters to scout other enemies that are connected to that particular character.\n\nPlayers can use information learned to make choices about how they want to carry about specific missions. You can use stealth to sneak into heavily guarded areas, you can run in sword flying, or you can use Wraith powers to take over other characters and make them your minions.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EscapistMag\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/TheEscapistMag\nFind us Google+: http://bit.ly/EscapistGoogle\nFollow us on Pinterest: http://bit.ly/EscapistPins\nCheck out our Merch: http://www.splitreason.com/theescapist", "title": "MIDDLE-EARTH: SHADOW OF MORDOR GAMEPLAY (Escapist News Now)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-24T00:12:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FJvq8_uDBs", "description": "\u017dab\u010dice, duben 2014", "title": "Mokr\u00e1 veverka po p\u00e1du do rybn\u00edka", "publishedDate": "2014-05-21T17:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FKFpUZX-Rw", "description": "the best movies of the great and unfortunately dead actor heath ledger in my opinion.. send your top 10 in the comment section or just post a comment..\n\nenjoy.", "title": "Top 10 Heath Ledger Movies", "publishedDate": "2010-02-02T15:42:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FKIlBUNyyE", "description": "Black and yellow-Whiz Khalkha", "title": "S Fudge and E Thistle rap", "publishedDate": "2010-12-23T00:40:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FKPDOpKzDo", "description": "Coach Carter Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/LjNqRY\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nCoach Carter (Samuel L.

Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) was once a star player on the Richmond High School basketball team in Richmond, CA, and years later, after establishing himself in publishing and marketing, he returns to the school and to the team as the new basketball coach. Carter quickly sees that his work is cut out for him -- the team is having an awful season, and their fights off the court are more decisive than their play on the court. While Carter wants to make the Richmond cagers into a winning team, he also wants a lot more -- to teach the boys to respect themselves and one another, and that they must excel in the classroom as well as in the gymnasium. Under Carter's guidance, the team turns their losing season around, with the state title a genuine possibility. However, when Carter learns that a number of his players have let their grade point averages slip below 2.3, as mandated in a contract he entered into with the students, he decides to lock the team out of the gym and send them into study hall until their marks improve. Carter's plan quickly becomes a subject of controversy among parents and team boosters, and their objections are soon picked up by the local news media, many of whom are not sympathetic to Carter's belief that his players must have goals beyond college ball or the NBA. Coach Carter also features Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez as members of the team, and R&B diva Ashanti in her film debut as the girlfriend of one of Carter's players.\n\n\"coach carter\",\"coach carter clip\",\"coach carter part 1\",\"coach carter full movie\",\"samuel l jackson\",\"channing tatum\",\"rob brown\",\"robert richard\",\"antwon tanner\",\"nana gbewonyo\",\"texas battle\",\"sports dramas\",basketball,biography,drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"sports stories\",\"triumph of the underdogs\",\"van toffler\",\"david gale\",\"michael tollin\",\"brian robbins\",\"nan morales\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++304499,/m/0f5xn,/m/084snt,/m/09knm1,/m/087v8v,/m/0f9vlr,/m/06lvlf,/m/09x8hz", "title": "Coach Carter (5/9) Movie CLIP - A Better Life (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T19:57:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FKU__DP2Rc", "description": "Hay Hill Garden Market at 1625 Bluff Rd. in Columbia, SC is partnering with serious local talent like Jenks Farmer for perennial sourcing & deeply detailed plant species information essays available via download from a special QR code on each plant tag.\n\nHay Hill Garden Market\n1625 Bluff Road, Columbia, SC 29201\nPhone: 803.834.6652\nhttp://www.facebook.com/hayhillgardenmarket\n@hayhillsc\nHours: Mon-Sat, 9am-6pm\n\nAbout Jenks Farmer\nPlantsman, http://www.JenksFarmer.com\n\nHorticulturist, seventh-generation South Carolinian, nursery owner, crinum lily expert, author, garden curator, and more, Jenks Farmer is partnering with Hay Hill to find the highest quality, most sustainable perennial plants and organic gardening materials.

Then place it into an ice bath to keep it cold.\n\nSecond, add concentrated sulfuric acid directly to the solution and constantly stir. As you add it will produce iodine.\n\nAt first the mixture will become pasty and eventually liquefy.\n\nOnce it's liquefied, pour it directly into cold water (the ice bath itself is useful for this) and stir it up. Then let it settle for ten minutes or so.\n\nThe iodine will settle to the bottom so pour off the water and acid.\n\nThe iodine will still be contaminated with acid so you'll need to add water and pour off several times to get out most of the acid.\n\nFilter it and now you have a solid plug of iodine.\n\nIt's usable as-is for most purposes but you can purify by placing it in a beaker with a ice-filled round bottom flask on top. Then heat the beaker. The iodine will vaporize and deposit on the flask.\n\nA cool reaction is to take some iodine and pour magnesium powder over it. It will react to form a purple cloud of iodine vapor. If it doesn't react quickly enough, just add a drop of water.", "title": "Make Iodine from Sulfuric acid and Alkali Metal Iodide", "publishedDate": "2009-03-28T23:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2F_r8j5aYgs", "description": "La Page officielle :\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Karim.ElGanG.Page.Officiel", "title": "Karim ELGANG ,Bilal Milano & Djamel Stay 1 2 3 Viva l'Alg\u00e9rie \u0641\u064a \u064a\u062f\u064a \u0631\u0627\u0641\u062f \u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T11:25:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2F_uj0IpqVE", "description": "Pon un Troll en tu vida, Si te quieres re\u00edr eres bienvenido :D\nClick aqu\u00ed para Suscribirte \u25ba http://bit.ly/18wvSUa\nCAMISETAS TROLL LOL \u25ba http://www.latostadora.com/CooLife\n\u00bfQUIERES JUGAR? \u25ba https://twitter.com/CooLifeGame\nFacebook  \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/Coolifegame\n\n\nPARTICIPANTES:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByufJrYE7jU ( ANTONIO SANCHO)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N16-1jD7FaI ( HuevoGordo )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSmKfNs1tG8&feature=youtu.be (AlexPrice )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCucELfFk6g&feature=youtu.be  (Nekos Games )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KNF220LpU8 ( iTeamBash Rap )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_0maEa8YFc&feature=youtu.be  (luciano mereles )\n\nVuestros LAIK y comentarios me agrandan el ... coraz\u00f3n ( L ) \n\nJUEGA AL LOL GRATIS CO\u00d1O!: http://bit.ly/1fjjDJE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Coolifegame", "title": "LEAGUE OF BUGS | VOLANDO A CUENCA | Cap 3", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T17:49:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Fa8-rhlm2A", "description": "O Sajna - Is a heart touching song sung by Puja Thaker & Gajendra Verma.

While this trend within Catholicism is more subdued and focused on the actual gifts of the Spirit in its Anglo manifestation, its Hispanic adherents interpret it more as a lively and even boisterous form of praise. The actual origins of this melody are clearly Afro American, and this organ version, played by our organist Richard Mendenhall, clearly manifests this more clearly than the more contemporary, fast-tempo interpretation of this hymn.

Director Bruno Monsaingeon, himself a concert violinist, first heard Markov during a recital in New York entirely devoted to the Caprices and was left utterly dumbfounded. He says of that concert, \"the technical difficulties, as if naturally overcome, had been replaced by an incandescent musical imagination which made the Paganini Caprices a thrilling experience, far removed from the school-masterly and cautious approach of most violinists.\" Sir Yehudi Menuhin says \"Alexander Markov will certainly leave his mark on the music-lovers of the world and in the annals of the violin virtuosi of our day. He is without doubt, one of the most brilliant and musical of violinists.\" Mstislav Rostropovich says: \"Once I managed to hear his performance of the 24 Paganini Caprices on TV I am certain that he is one of the most interesting young violinists of his generation in the entire world.\"", "title": "Paganini - Caprice no.02, Alexander Markov, violin [HD]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T06:32:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FqXZYhoNKE", "description": "\"When the spinous rotates to the open side of the wedge, but the convexity of the scoliosis is on the opposite side, contact the mammillary process on the convex side of the scoliosis.

I take that back. I think about thinking of stuff...if that makes sense. \n\nWell, it's like I'm getting to know myself, asking myself simple questions like what I do with my time, what I want to do next week. All that jazz. Just so I can refresh my memory of who I am. But right now, I'm just listening. The birds are chirping, it smells like pasta, the cars are loud and the people are quiet. There's hardly anyone out on this beautiful Sunday morning. My last Sunday morning in Italy, to be exact. \n\nWeirdly enough, there she is. Standing right there, eyes \nwide and afraid, like she's been waiting. Anxiously, patiently, because she knows I have things to say to her. \n\nThe wind stirs, and her auburn locks flip into her face, her cobalt eyes being cast aside quickly, but she doesn't move. \n\nShe doesn't hide. \n\nShe knows I've waited long enough; I think we all have. \nSo, I'll be the brave one. I walk up to her. I purse lips, ready to speak. But she's meeting me half way, weird.\n\n\"Hey.\" Softly she begins, \"Weird seeing you here Cleo...\" \n\n\"Same with you...what are you doing here?\" \n\n\"Um, business...\" Sophia trails off, the winds flipping her hair again. I suppress a giggle, \"Bull shit. Really, what are you doing here?\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" She scuffed her shoes, \"Running, again...\" \n\n\"You can stop now; your little game is over. You lose.\" \n\n\"I know.\" She replies to my snarky remark, and she quickly catches my eyes, but I show little to no remorse. \n\nI repeat, carefully, slowly, \"What. Are. You. Doing. Here?\" \n\n\"It's hard to explain,\" Sophia began again. I shook my head, and sighed, averting the subject \"I have to pick up a few things for Margo, did you hear? She's getting married.\" \n\n\"Wow, I'm so happy for her.\" She looks genuine, her eyes glittering, the slightest bit of appreciativeness \noverwhelming her gentle, doe like eyes. \n\n\"Anyways, I don't know this part of Rome that well, and I was wondering if you could help me.\" \n\nShe just stares at me for a moment, and in her eyes, I can see she doubts what I'm saying, as if she's wondering if I'm speaking to someone behind her. She looks around, \n\"Oh...um, sure! I'd love to.\" \n\nHer accent is gruff, and groggy. She smells, and it seems \nlike she's been around a couple times too many. But I don't care, because in this moment I'm actually beginning to like Sophia. \n\nBut like I said, only in this moment.", "title": "C L E O. 2x24 Part 1", "publishedDate": "2011-05-09T03:41:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FtU97AL0Oo", "description": "Calgary Home & Garden Show 2014: Custom Cottage Walk-through http://experthome.ca/cottage-videos/\n\nBrad Sander, CEO and President of Expert Home, debuts the 2014 Custom Cottage at Calgary's 2014 Home and Garden Show.", "title": "Expert Home - Custom Cottage Recreational Home Tour", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T06:26:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FtxEocu0ac", "description": "A Bart\u00f3k32 Gal\u00e9ria legut\u00f3bb Szikszai K\u00e1roly k\u00e9pz\u0151m\u0171v\u00e9sz k\u00e9peit mutatta be a ker\u00fcleti k\u00f6z\u00f6ns\u00e9g el\u0151tt.

These snow houses can be constructed even at latitudes far from the Arctic regions.\n\n\nWarning\nWhen inside the igloo, make sure you have adequate ventilation. Always keep the entrance open.\n\nStep 1: Select a quarry site\nSelect a suitable site for quarrying snow blocks. The snow should be firm enough to cut into blocks, but soft enough to allow the blocks to fuse when pressed together. If the snow is too soft, tramp on it for 15 to 30 minutes, then wait another half hour to let it collect.\n\nTip\nProbe the snow with a pole to make sure the snow in the quarry site formed in one snowfall. Multilayered snow tends to fracture and is unsuitable for building igloos.\n\nStep 2: Dig a trench\nUse a snow shovel to dig a trench beside the quarrying site. The trench will provide access to the underside of the snow blocks, allowing you to free them as you cut them to size.\n\nStep 3: Start a circular spiral\nUse the snow saw to cut enough blocks to make a circle on the ground that is the size you want your igloo to be, leaving space for the door. Trim the blocks so that successive block is slightly higher than the preceding one. Smooth the ramp with the snow knife. A spiral ramp should result when you arrange the blocks in the circle.\n\nTip\nThe size of your blocks will gradually decrease, but the largest blocks, used at the base, should be rectangular \u2013 about 3 feet long, 18 inches high, and 8 inches thick. The blocks will gradually become more and more triangular, rather than rectangular, as you move up the igloo.\n\nStep 4: Make a door\nMake the door by placing two blocks vertically, facing outward, with a third block on top.\n\nTip\nPlace the blocks slightly aslant so that they taper toward the inside of the igloo. \n\nStep 5: Complete the dome\nContinue adding blocks to form a dome, removing snow build-up from the inside as you work. Add the last few blocks from inside the igloo, leaving a small ventilation hole in the roof. \n\nStep 6: Fill any cracks with snow\nFill any open cracks with snow, and smooth the inside of the igloo to prevent dripping. \n\nStep 7: Construct an entry passage\nConstruct an entrance covered with snow blocks. Dig into the snow so that the entry passage is below the level of the igloo's door to prevent heat from escaping. \n\nDid You Know?\nIgloos work not by providing heat, but by preserving heat generated by the human body.", "title": "How to Build an Igloo", "publishedDate": "2010-03-10T13:00:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2FvOA2lBSrs", "description": "Una recensione di Simonetta Bartolini del libro Eudeamon di Erika Moak, pubblicato dalla casa editrice zero91.", "title": "Radio Rai: L'Argonauta - Eudeamon di Erika Moak", "publishedDate": "2010-05-11T12:28:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Fv_Gq1NEl8", "description": "\uc190\ud765\ubbfc Heung-Min Son Great Goal - Zenit Petersburg vs Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 (UCL) 04/11/2014\n\uc190\ud765\ubbfc Heung-Min Son Great Goal - Zenit Petersburg vs Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 (UCL) 04/11/2014\n\uc190\ud765\ubbfc Heung-Min Son Great Goal - Zenit Petersburg vs Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 (UCL) 04/11/2014", "title": "\uc190\ud765\ubbfc Heung-Min Son Great Goal - Zenit Petersburg vs Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 (UCL) 04/11/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T18:28:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Fw0lrRSaUI", "description": "http://www.clicktotweet.com/C0fz4\n\nThis is The Walking Dead Terminus from the Backlot at the Halloween Horror Nights Employee Preview at Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, California.\n\nBusiness Contact: deathbyillusion@live.com\n\nFan Mail: deathbyillusion@live.com\n\nSupport, Questions, Concerns, and Copyright issues: deathbyillusion@live.com\n\nCheck Out Our Other Channel Http://www.youtube.com/user/CoasterSpot\n\nMy Website: http://www.CoasterSpot.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter http://www.twitter.com/deathbyillusion\n\nAdd me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/deathbyillusion\n\nFacebook Fan Page: http://www.facebook.com/deathbyillusionfanpage\n\nAdd me on Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/deathbyillusion\n\nAdd Me On Google Plus: http://www.plus.google.com/104182120878203142488\n\nFan Mail To: P.O.

This Act paved the way in 2007 for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") to grant special \"U Visas\" to immigrants (both male and female) who are victims of egregious crimes and cooperate with authorities to prosecute the perpetrators.  In this program, immigration attorney Harlan York provides an extensive examination of U Visas and the winning strategies that can be employed by attorneys to successfully obtain them for their clients.  Mr. York begins his presentation with a discussion of the requirements for a U Visa and the supporting documents required with the application.  He then explains how to handle an initial intake meeting, ask critical questions, and assess the strength of a potential client's case.  Mr. York does a stellar job of explaining how to overcome common pitfalls (removal proceedings, ineligibility, and missing documents), and also stresses the importance of establishing a rapport with law enforcement so that the essential \"Supplemental B\" form can be acquired.  This program is a must see for immigration attorneys who want to learn how to file U Visas on their clients' behalf.", "title": "\"U Visas: Benefits for Battered Immigrant Women and Other Crime Victims,\" Harlan York", "publishedDate": "2011-07-22T22:19:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Fy5sVrgPuI", "description": "Its Chanterelle Mushroom season here in Missouri, and they are yummy.

He was injured by a magical poisoned arrow and lived in pain as he was immortal but could not heal himself.\n\nChiron calls to us to examine our own deepest pain. Fear, rejection, where we feel alienated in life are all under the domain of Chiron.\n\nIn some versions of the story, he wounded himself to save mankind so there is also an association with self sacrifice.\n\nChiron recently entered Pisces followed soon after by Neptune. Neptune is the ruling planet of Pisces and Chiron is also at home in these healing waters.\n\nThe temptation to heal others but not ourselves can be strong under this influence and many with this placement in their natal chart are devoted to healing careers.\n\nThe message is surely that by healing ourselves, we are better placed to help heal those around us and in doing so, create a healthier world for all.\n\nWhen we dig deep into our souls and shine a light into our own personal darkness we have the chance to confront and heal our innermost pain if we harness the energy that Chiron offers.\n\nThe placement of Chiron in your own personal birth chart will reveal where this healing is most needed. This could be a bad habit regarding health, a lack of self esteem in career or relationships, poor self expression or a negative belief in your core being, either way it is an imporant factor to bring to light.\n\nFor Society, Chiron in Pisces is significant as Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and represents our collective consciousness. We are now experiencing a return to Source. Science and spirituality are coming back together after a long period of false division. Soul searching and holistic living are where we can put our energies to take giant leaps towards elevation for ourselves and for humanity as a whole.\n\nSeparation is an illusion and yet one that has been believed since the imperialistic world carved everything into little boxes and took its scalpel to the human experience. This has been a very harmful experiment that has lead to mental, physical, emotional and spiritual distress.\n\nIt is vital to feel the interconnected nature of the All. Your connection to Source is the most important thing that you can recognize and celebrate right now and will solve the question of alienation and pain that Chiron has shown you.\n\nWe need to work together and happily, gratefully contribute to the needs of the collective, while knowing that the first step is to go deep inside and heal our own wounds.\n\nPhysician, heal thyself.\n\nhttp://www.astrozo.com/The-Planets-in-your-Chart(2255693).htm", "title": "Chiron sign", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T14:07:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GET9D7mgo8", "description": "Meara McLaughlin, VP Business Development at FlightStats talks about   the creativity she finds in Amadeus and why Amadeus Partner Network represents a unique approach to the industry.\n\n\"I Hear more from different entities within the Amadeus universe that any other GDS that I speak with.\" \n\n\"There is a lot of creativity in the organisation, at every level.\"\n\n\"What is unique about Amadeus Partner Network is that I have a single point of contact.

It has a free turbine wheel which means, air is fed\nin the inlet, passes the guide vanes and hits the turbine wheel which in turn spins\nthe shaft that is connected to. Then, with a 12:1 gear ratio the power is transmitted to \nto a propeller (108mm x 68mm). For its size i think it's quite powerful, but  \ni don't know if it could fly a small rc plane. Maybe if i could increase the air pressure for example at 50 or 60 psi it would probably be able to lift a micro rc plane. The reason i didn't do it was due to the fact that i wasn't sure if the bearings could withstand that much stress ...Also, this engine could be used as a micro turboshaft engine for a micro sized hepicopter, as it has really good torque. The only limiting factor i think is the air supply. It's difficult to make a reliable micro air tank that could fit to a micro sized aircraft, that is strong enough to withstand high pressure to power the engine for 3 or more minutes, and small enough to fit the aircraft.\nAs you can see in the video the turbine wheel was spinning at 144,000 rpm which is pretty high and if i attempt to grab the shaft with my hand (if i remove the propeller of course) it's really hard to stop it which means it has some good torque. I will definitely connect it to an electric motor generator to see what kind of power it can produce.

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\n\n\nSchool science & people science\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "gas lighter  -how it works", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T00:05:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GI5_BauG4Y", "description": "Adam Jarvis - Misery Index - The Weakener.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease.

(http://www.panda.org.cn/english/)\n\nThe care takers are bringing the baby pandas indoors with their mother. They do this during the summer to let the baby pandas cool down. Below is the wiki entry on the Giant Panda:\n\nThe panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, lit. \"black and white cat-foot\"),[2] also known as the giant panda to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda, is a bear[3] native to central-western and south western China.[4] It is easily recognized by its large, distinctive black patches around the eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99% bamboo.[5] Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[6][7]\nThe giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.[8] As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.\nThe panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.[4] A 2007 report shows 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.[9] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[9] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[10] Some reports also show that the number of pandas in the wild is on the rise.[11][12] However, the IUCN does not believe there is enough certainty yet to reclassify the species from Endangered to Vulnerable.[1]\nWhile the dragon has often served as China's national emblem, internationally the panda appears at least as commonly. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.", "title": "Baby Giant Panda being Moved | Chengdu China", "publishedDate": "2012-08-18T18:17:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GPXVwGUVKQ", "description": "\u00c7ekili\u015fe Kat\u0131lmak \u0130\u00e7in Yapman\u0131z Gerekenler Yorum Yerine \u015eunlar\u0131 Yazmak Vede Kanal\u0131ma Abone Olmak : \n\nAd : \nSoyad : \nSkype :\nFacebook :", "title": "Minecraft Premium \u00c7ekili\u015fi : Biti\u015f Tarihi : 5.8.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-01T23:57:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GPZ9tQ8aOU", "description": "Wiz Khalifa - LetR (28 Grams)\n\n\n\n\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR\nWiz Khalifa - LetR", "title": "Wiz Khalifa - LetR 28 Grams (Oficial Audio) HD 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T14:40:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GPknlF-Ge8", "description": "I wonder if people who are against the death penalty are truly against it or are just against it for people they judge as not being worthy of it. \n\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/troy-davis-lawrence-brewer-2-executions-2-very-different-reactions.html", "title": "Anti Death Penalty Inconsistency", "publishedDate": "2011-09-26T01:45:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GPv0SvDU2Y", "description": "Westringia fruticosa - maintenance", "title": "Westringia fruticosa - maintenance", "publishedDate": "2011-08-22T03:00:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GQ40lO9bKA", "description": "Don't watch video before dinner\nYou many loose your apetite", "title": "Elliott video 18 Butcher shop in Moradabad", "publishedDate": "2009-01-18T14:31:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GQ8cbSIISI", "description": "Forse si vede un po' male.\nIn tal caso, mi scuso anticipatamente.", "title": "The Silent Comedy-Exploitation Lyrics", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20T02:20:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GQNOWH91Rg", "description": "Muzyka: \nSirsy - Fireflies\n\nhttp://ewelinka2100-news-sims2.blog.onet.pl/\n\nNora Cane (27 l.) budzi si\u0119 pewnego ranka w szpitalu bez \u015bwiadomo\u015bci tego gdzie i dlaczego si\u0119 znajduj\u0119 oraz... kim s\u0105 otaczaj\u0105cy j\u0105 ludzie.

Highest Concentration (More than 3x Strength): 1-Scoop Potency. Reactive hyperemia describes the increase in muscle blood flow that occurs during high-intensity resistance exercise and produces the \"pump\" associated with increases in muscle size. The Nitraflex pretraining formula contains ingredients that in vitro, animal and clinical studies suggest possess properties that may help advanced athletes maximize energy, intensity, vascularity and reactive hyperemia (pumps) during their workouts, and provide long-term support of testosterone and nitric oxide levels in the healthy range when used as directed. Unique Properties of some of the key compounds in Nitraflex: 1-Scoop Potency: Nitraflex is so potent, only 1 scoop (1 serving) is necessary. Do not exceed 1 scoop in a single 24-hour period. Do not take Nitraflex with 5 hours of bedtime. High Citrulline: Arginine Ratio: Arginine is a proven precursor in nitric oxide (NO), a vasodialator. What most people don't know is that Arginine supplementation stimulates the activity of arginase, an enzyme that breaks down Arginine. Over time, this may actually result in reduced Arginine and NO levels in turn causing your preworkout formula to stop working. Research suggests that supplementing with a high ration of citrulline to Arginine may reduce this risk by avoiding overstimulation of arginase. 6 Weeks of Testosterone: Calcium fructopyranose borate (CFB) has been shown to increase testosterone in health subjects. The average increase in total and free testosterone in a 6-week study was 56% and 29.5% respectively. In a second study, total and free testosterone increased on 3 hours after a single dose of CFB. Effective Doses of Beta-Alanine: The clinically-proven performance enhancer beta-alanine was not \"fairy dusted\" in this formula. Rather, we added an exceptionally powerful does that you will feel working following your very first serving. Creatine-Free: Creatine causes water retention, which can make achieving a dry, hard muscular look even more difficult. Sometimes creatine is added to products precisely for this reason. (When you see yourself getting bloated, you may be fooled into thinking the product is \"working.\") We left it out of Nitraflex precisely for this reason. Cognitive Enhancers: Nitraflex contains unique ratios of scientifically validated compounds that help you remain alert, intense and focused while you're flying from set to set with veins fully dialated and muscles pumped to the hilt.", "title": "GAT Nitraflex Review - CFB & Vasoactive Compounds", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T23:56:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GwYg4eweLw", "description": "Initiaion bio 2014", "title": "Bapt\u00eame phyllostachys (Bambou)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T18:59:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Gwe68kpKb8", "description": "I love this couple They're amazing and so cute really?\n\nI made this video because I love the show  but mostly I like charlotte and gary\n\nI dedicate this video to all the fans of this big show...GEORDIE SHORE!!! \nHahahahahahahah and by all who see it for these two as well :)\n\nGeordie shore make me so happy because it makes me smile and laugh\nThey are very funny and amazing, living life day to day and  they know  enjoy it", "title": "Charlotte & Gaz | I will always want you", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T11:33:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2GxjZWgH-tI", "description": "Album - Once More", "title": "Dolly Parton & Porter Wagoner 08 - Ragged Angel", "publishedDate": "2012-02-19T00:07:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Gy0UyuToPM", "description": "Hear from the Frozen filmmakers on how Norway inspired Disney's newest animated feature.

This method requires you change your compass setting 3 times, thus, 1-2-3. If the first setting has radius 1, the second setting has radius 2, and the third setting has radius 3. The largest circle is tangent to both of the smaller circles at the same time, and so it becomes difficult to discern where the curve changes from one circle to the other (after the construction lines have been removed). We are pattern recognizing machines, and so our eyes are quickly fooled into seeing an oval, rather than seeing the intersection of four circles. A similar technique may be used to draw an egg, by changing the size of one of the two smaller circles.

In 2010 over 1/3 fell out. By 2011 I was bald and missing most of my body hair. In late Feburary 2012 I discovered an amazing doctor and company that could reverse it by simply changing my diet and taking vitamin/mineral supplements.\n\nIf anyone needs help with their Gluten Free diet or how to live and recover from Alopecia Areata please feel free to email me at emjbecker@yahoo.com\n\nAlso I am not a doctor and I am not claiming I can cure anything. All I can do is share with you the steps I took and my results.\n\n\nHere is my Testimony which can be found on my site: \nSince fall 2008 I was losing my hair. At first it was small nickle sized patches of hair that fell out. One month after my hair stylist discovered my first bald patch I passed two (painful) kidney stones. During the first year of suffering I feared going to the doctors for two reasons. First I had no health insurance and I don't believe in buying into anything I can't pay back immediately; secondly, I knew they would only offer drugs -- a steroid they inject into you scalp or taken orally that only covers up the symptoms and not cure/reverse the actual problem.\n\nIn June 2010 I had about a fourth of my hair gone, just enough to look amazing on my wedding day. But within three month of that I had lost two thirds of my hair (probably more). I looked very sick and fell into a depression, and my loving husband allowed me to shave my head so that it would boost myself esteem in the fact that I had control over how I looked, being bald was a choice and I wouldn't look sickly. This helped my depression for sometime.\n\nIn January 2012 everything went down hill, I was almost bald, no eyelashes, no eyebrows, very little body hair and became more stressed out then I thought I could ever be. We ate fairly healthy foods with occasional fast food. Nothing I could do would help.\n\nThen in February 2012 my husband who listens to the Live show of Alex Jones everyday mentioned Dr. Wallach and thought we might check it out, just to become healthy.  We ordered the Healthy Brain and Heart Pack to try it out, got instant results from the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and decided to see his seminar here in Bloomington, MN not even considering that Dr. Wallach could help with my alopecia until we got there.  We listened to his amazing lecture and at the end he started taking questions.  Being nervous with the possibility that he couldn't help I put my hand up. (Earlier in the lecture Dr. Wallach had asked if we had a dog, and we talked about how if I fed my dog Sadie human food she'd die.)\n\n\nTo nervous to ask the question I just said \"I have Alopecia\". He went through the list of Celiac disease symptoms and I had all of them, then he told me I was a celiac and needed to cut Gluten (Wheat, Rye, Barley and Oats) he was going to put me on the Healthy Start Pack but since I was such a severe case he said to take the Healthy Brain and Heart Pack (thankfully that's the one I started on three days before the seminar).\n\nIn the first week the pattern of my hair falling out and growing back stopped. Nothing fell out. Now it is hard to go gluten free but with gluten free spaghetti and hot dogs I managed the first week then expanded from there. Hair was growing in the first two weeks, it was amazing but I couldn't get my hopes up because this and happen in the past with my condition, after a month I had most my eyebrows and eyelashes, hair on my head was baby hair (thin white hair).  After two months more hair kept growing, now 6 months later my body hair and the hair on my head is in full force. All the hair on my head has returned, I feel better than I ever have... All the anxiety and depression is gone my hair is back! And I look GOOD!\n\n\nStop eating their poison, think for yourself, learn about all the different solutions! Become the healthy independent God intended you to be!\n\nHope I helped others! Take care.\n\n**** FDA Required Legal Notice ********\n\n We do not treat or cure disease.

You'll need long pants to cover part of your shoe, and room in the pant leg for the clip and wire. \n\nStep 2: Attach the clip to the pocket\nAttach the clip with the retractable wire to one of the bottom of one of the front pockets in the pants. Then use one or two safety pins to attach the stopper next to the clip. \n\nTip\nThe belt clip is often used with cell phones or ID badges and can be found inexpensively online. The drawstring stopper is often found on outdoor clothing. \n\nStep 3: Attach the shoelaces\nTie a pair of shoelaces to the end of the retractable wire. The shoelaces must be identical to the ones on the shoes you will wear during the trick. \n\nTip\nThe laces on the wire will be sticking out from the bottom of your pant leg, so make sure they look like untied laces. \n\nStep 4: Pull the wire down\nPull the wire with the laces attached down to the bottom of the pant leg, so the laces extend further than the pant leg, but not so far that the wire is exposed when the pants are on. \n\nTip\nPart of the untied laces should be hidden inside the pant leg.\n\nStep 5: Fold the wire\nMake a small fold in the top of the wire, near the clip. Take the folded piece of wire and slide it through the stopper, and then release the stopper button so that the stopper is clamping down on the folded wire. This will keep the wire extended down to the bottom of the pant leg. \n\nStep 6: Put the pants on\nPut the pants on and set up the bottom of your pant leg so it covers the laces that are already tied on your shoe. Let the untied laces attached to the wire hang down over your shoes. \n\nStep 7: Perform the trick\nShake your foot as if you're trying to tie your shoe with no hands. Squeeze the stopper from the outside of your pants to release the wire and, when the wire retracts, show the already tied laces to your audience. \n\nDid You Know?\nNumerical simulations have shown that the trefoil knot has the shortest possible rope length.", "title": "How to Do the Self-Tying Shoelace Trick", "publishedDate": "2011-02-28T15:56:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2H8x83WWvQ4", "description": "Motifs are used often in classical music.

Quite often you'll see a school of fish and generally the larger mackerel, etc aren't far away,  Drift the school and structure with knife jigs can be a game changer and put some runs on the board.  That's what we did in this video and scored some nice Spanish for the effort, or else we wouldn't have caught anything.  Just drop your jig to the bottom and high speed retrieve, Mackerel just love a fast retrieve and will quickly home in on your lure if in the area.  This jigging technique is also great on other species such as Yellowtail Kingfish and Samson fish.\nThe jigs are Reidy's Heavy duty knife jigs, with a great variety of sizes.  The only thing I would recommend is putting wire assist hook rigs on to prevent bite off by Spanish mackerel's sharp teeth.\nTo get into some of the best Spanish Mackerel and Reef fishing on the Great Barrier Reef, make sure you check out our long range Mothershipping charters to some remote untouched fishing some 200 kilometres or more offshore, It just doesn't get any better.\nPlease rate and subscribe with more great fishing videos and tips coming soon,\nCheers Greg\nFor more information on our Mothershipping fishing Charters to the Great Barrier Reef and some of the best reef fishing videos, be sure to check out our website at\nhttp://www.mackayfishingcharters.com.au/", "title": "Knife Jigging for Spanish Mackerel", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T11:30:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2HOH0_sn764", "description": "www.balticsession.com\nFB: balticsession", "title": "Mother Leiomy Prodigy Judge solo | JJ-Street Baltic Session 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T13:10:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2HOJhSr38oA", "description": "Infinity Pro's Ionic Shamballa Bracelets are the best way to get a constant supply of negative ions while looking gorgeous with a sparkling wrist!\n\nOur shamballa bracelets emit around 2600 negative ions per second!

In his first role since winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2001, Benicio del Toro stars as Aaron Hallam, one of the U.S. military's most skilled hand-to-hand combat operatives. In the years following his successful assassination of a Serbian warlord in late-'90s Kosovo, Hallam finds himself plagued by traumatic flashbacks of death and destruction, so much so that when he finally returns home, he regresses into a feral, survivalist state in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. There, he deliberately and elaborately hunts and kills poachers who happen to cross his path. When the FBI investigates the murders, they call in the man who taught Hallam everything he knows: retiree L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones). As the instructor pursues his unhinged former pupil, Bonham begins to learn about key events in Hallam's life that pushed him over the edge.\n\n\"the hunted\",\"the hunted clip\",\"the hunted trailer\",\"the hunted part 1\",\"the hunted knife fight\",\"the hunted full movie\",\"the hunted 1995\",\"the hunted 2003\",\"tommy lee jones\",\"william friedkin\",\"snow videos\",\"wire videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime thrillers\",\"spy thrillers\",\"marcus viscidi\",\"compassion videos\",\"ethics videos\",\"helping videos\",\"justice videos\",\"nature videos\",\"cabin videos\",\"forest videos\",\"woods videos\",\"lt bonham\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++267164,/m/01kwsg", "title": "The Hunted (2/8) Movie CLIP - No More Snares on Wolves (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-03-03T00:17:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2HgdXDkmV60", "description": "", "title": "Hideki Tojo Brought to Justice", "publishedDate": "2012-04-09T22:51:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2HgnLnXoaTE", "description": "Xavier Mortimer fait son num\u00e9ro de Diabolo au festival \"Magic M\u00e9ribel\"\nMusique compos\u00e9e par Xavier Mortimer", "title": "Xavier Mortimer/ Complainte pour un Diabolo", "publishedDate": "2011-12-30T18:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Hgx2109Mf0", "description": "Floods in Bulgaria are now subsiding after claiming the lives of three people on Saturday.\n\nThe most severely affected area was in the Black Sea region around the city of Burgas, where much of the infrastructure has been destroyed.\n\u2026\nREAD MORE : http://www.euronews.com/2014/09/07/bulgaria-mourns-flood-victims\n\nWhat is in the news today?

The workshops have to be conducted in some form of incarceration because if one goes after these children on the platforms they vanish to another platform, another life. A few weeks on the platform and the child is into drug abuse and sex-work.\n\npandies' workshops create theatre with these children spanning their lives at home, the travails and highs of platform living, at the shelters and for those who return home, issues of return. Stories of neglect, of exploitation and maltreatment, of being treated as Nobody's children. Through the medium of collective dramatising the children go through a therapeutic process, demand what they seek from society, try create a collective vision of the future and above all, present a scathing critique of valorised institutions of middle class social living.\n\nThere is also the linking story of the young who facilitate them. Sagas of youthful, nonconformism. Narratives of their trauma of working with these children, of confronting truths and lies of their own middle class existence.\n\nOfftrack is an attempt to recreate these stories. Five stories off the tracks, from the platforms, from the skits made by the platform young looking at the world from their perspective. Five stories laced with hard humour, overflowing with joy and sorrow of living. These stories strung together with vignettes from the lives of their facilitators.\n\nWhen the two voices come together, they present a challenge to all norms of structured living.\nAsking for greater resources and fundamental changes in policies vis-a-vis these children, Offtrack takes another step in pandies' movement towards a theatre of Confrontation asking its audience to define better 'roles' for itself.\nCast Team\nDiksha Lamba\nJitender\nMuntazir\nUdit Khurana\nPriya Prethora\nShilpi Gulati\nAtul Bandhu\nNikita\nRohan Sachdeva\nKritika Aggarwal\nSanyukta Saha\nVineet Tirkha\nVishwa Gulati\n\n\nThe play is being directed by Sanjay Kumar.\n\nThe group seeks funding from private resources and willing donors", "title": "Pandies Theatre Delhi", "publishedDate": "2012-03-31T10:12:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2I-zOJ5JAI4", "description": "Porsche Exclusive is on a showering spree which is recently concluded by a palladium metallic painted 2015 Cayenne. \nThe exclusive scheme for outer is crusted with elite metallic palladium shade on every nooks and corner inclusive of 21-inch SportEdition alloys, bumpers, rear diffuser and ORVMs. There are quad exhausts along with smoked headlamps complementing the perfect outlook of season. \nExtensiveness of contrasting can be sensed inside by means of air con vents, grab rails, dashboard, sun visor, steering wheel, armrest and seats.
