This particular was made by Zuker, comes in a wide range of colors. And a simple rule to remember is during dark days or early morning, throw the darker colors, something like this and then during the bright sunny days, go with something brighter, something like this. Size, you know it's up to you. If the fish are really a little bit smaller, I would probably go ahead and throw something smaller like this.\n\nNow there's other ones that come out like this where the heads are all drooled out, the water passes through and makes a big bubble trail. It's good for attracting fish. It's really popular for sale fish and marlin stuff, but also works for yellowtail and they come in a wide range of sizes too.\n\nNow the larger feathers for yellowtail would probably -- this would probably the maximum size I would use for yellowtail personally. Now the way you rig these, is with the double hook and it just slides on. You just tie it on directly and it would sit just like this.\n\nNow one thing that I like to do, cheating a little bit is I'll put a big McMahon swivel in between the double hook so as that lure and that feather runs through the water, they can twist and turn, and it won't mess up my line, because by throwing lots of times we ruin our line because the lure is spending through the water and stuff. So adding this little swivel will help that.\n\nNow some anglers like to use a large single hook and the thinking behind that is that the hook will grab a bigger piece of meat that the fish will make a harder to get away. But I usually go for yellowtail, I'll stay with the double hook like this.\n\nNow for slow trolling, these are going to troll a little bit faster. Slow trolling if you go something like this. This is a long A by Bomber, comes in a wide variety colors. If I use a slow troll of this like with the 4O with 50-pound test line, it will work great and again, pick the colors according to the bait fish that are in the water. You might want to go sardine colors, macro colors or something like this, this would work fun.\n\nOnce you find the fish, then it's up to you. You can go ahead. You locate the fish by this method of trolling, then once you find the fish, you can go ahead and switch over and through an artificial bait like an iron jig, or something like this a popper jig. This is a creek chub, and all you do is cast it out right to the fish and the scoring fish crank it back really fast and it just makes a bigger traction the fish come up and eat --", "title": "How to Select a Feather for Yellowtail Fishing Video", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T23:19:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FCGnBNUkhs", "description": "Trio Punta Icaco: Cumbia Chinandegana\nMusica Nicaraguense de corinto\nbordenmission.org", "title": "Trio Punta Icaco: Cumbia Chinandegana", "publishedDate": "2013-07-06T15:09:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FChTqAaxCg", "description": "anniversaire dans la vie hhhhh  https://www.facebook.com/belharraga.ryo", "title": "accidence", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12T16:32:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FCrrVBidq4", "description": "Obstructed duplicated ureter: Axial: Sequence of images using axial, sagittal, and 3D volume rendering demonstrates a duplicated collecting system of the left kidney with an obstructive upper pole ureter with loss of cortex int he upper pole of the left kidney.

The PBF Personal Trainer Cert. Program is a very unique, unmatchable, and well rounded program.  We provide trainers (all levels, certified and those looking to get certified) with real hands on training experience in areas such as outdoor/indoor boot-camps, Endurance Circuit training, Speed & Agility training for youth and elite athletes, individual weight loss, weight gain, Enhancing Athletes overall performance, Sports specific weight training, Special population weight training and Functional training, Youth Athletic Development training, and much more.  \n \n     Unlike most programs we do not place our focus on filling up the class for show and tell. Everyone who registers for this program will get worked to the max.  We expect you to stay on the study schedule, mandatory show for the trainings, perform community service hours, and maintain a positive and humble attitude towards others.  Andre chooses to mentor the trainers during the course of the camp, providing them all with the knowledge needed to positively change the lives of many.  Andre has studied and analyzed the training industry and believes that adding his personal touch to this program, gives trainers an edge over most because the industry is overpopulated with one dimensional trainers. I ask the question, why settle for being good in one style of training when you have the opportunity to be good in many? Yes, It's great to have a wall loaded with certifications and degrees but what good are they if you don't have the confidence to train someone, the proper hands on guidance, and you don't look the part?  We expose our trainers to Andre's scheduled trainings from week to week. This allows them to witness the pressure and realities that come along with being a go-getter trainer.\n \n  For a total of 5 and a half months (22 weeks) the trainers have to shadow Andre during a number of different personal training sessions.  They will be assigned every 2 weeks, a section in the book to read and study  (with a scheduled 2hr per week group study available), followed by a mandatory meeting to assure that everyone is on the right track.  After months of studying together, shadowing training sessions, learning and participating in number of different marketing strategies, and giving back time to our communities and the less fortunate.  The sacrifices made by each trainer throughout the course of the class hold a value much greater than what it cost (in time and money) to attend it. \n \nAfter completing and passing the PB Personal Training Program,  trainers will have earned the right to wear the brand! A brand that's reliable, delivers top quality training on a consistent bases, and holds an A+ customer service reputation that stands out.\n \nPro Builder Fitness Inc. - TODAY A PLAYER, TOMORROW A PRO!

We are currently accepting legal claims for children with spina bifida who were exposed to Depakote in utero. We may be able to help your child recover compensation through a depakote lawsuit. Children with spina bifida have a lifetime of special needs. Compensation available through a depakote lawsuit may include recovery for past and future medical expenses, including both hospital and out-patient needs, as well as pain and suffering.\n\nIf your child has spina bifida and was exposed to depakote in utero, please contact us toll-free at (888) 552-5247 for a free consultation regarding a depakote lawsuit. It is not too late to get your child the help he or she needs.\n\nIf we do not make a recovery for your child, you owe nothing.\n\nDepakote and Spina Bifida\n\nDepakote is a drug indicated in the treatment of bipolar mania. The FDA has warned that Depakote is a major teratogen. In particular, exposure to depakote drastically increases the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. According to the FDA:\n\n\"The risk of neural tube defects is much higher in babies born to mothers treated with valproate during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with the risk increasing to 1 in 20 babies... The rates for neural tube defects in babies exposed to valproate during the first trimester are 30 to 80 times higher than the rate for neural tube defects in the general U.S. population.\"\n\nThe FDA also released this video to alert consumers to the risk of birth defects associated with Depakote and Depakote ER (extended release):\n\nDepakote Birth Defect Registry\n\nIn April of 2009, the FDA asked the manufacturer of Depakote, Abbott Laboratories, to add information regarding the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry to the drug label. The Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry at Massachusetts General Hospital is designed to investigate the safety of drugs like Depakote when taken during pregnancy. The success of pregnancy registries depends upon consumers being aware of the ability to report pregnancy exposures to the registry. We strongly encourage all women exposed to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy to file a report with the registry by calling toll-free (888) 233-2334.\n\nDepakote Black-Box Birth Defect Warning\n\nDepakote was originally approved in 1978 for the treatment of epilepsy. Approvals for similar drugs followed for Depakote CP, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon, and Stavzor. Recently Depakote has been prescribed for less serious conditions such as migraine headache. Depakote has an extensive history of revisions to labeling related to birth defects and suicidality. As of 2009 the Depakote label contains a \"black box\" warning regarding teratogenity:\n\n\nTERATOGENICITY:\nVALPROATE CAN PRODUCE TERATOGENIC EFFECTS SUCH AS NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS(E.G., SPINA BIFIDA). ACCORDINGLY, THE USE OF DEPAKOTE TABLETS IN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL REQUIRES THAT THE BENEFITS OF ITS USE BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE RISK OF INJURY TO THE FETUS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THE TREATMENT OF A SPONTANEOUSLY REVERSIBLE CONDITION NOT ORDINARILY ASSOCIATED WITH PERMANENT INJURY OR RISK OF DEATH (E.G., MIGRAINE) IS CONTEMPLATED.

A PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET DESCRIBING THE TERATOGENIC POTENTIAL OF VALPROATE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS.\n\nA black-box warning is the most serious type of warning that can placed on a drug label.", "title": "Depakote Parmaceutical Claims (888) 55-BLAIR", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T01:24:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FH5EgAGT3I", "description": "Pneumatic+Conveyance Video", "title": "Pneumatic+Conveyance+by+KREISEL", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T02:12:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FHiV8gjIXg", "description": "Polyodon agression", "title": "Petrochromis Polyodon", "publishedDate": "2009-07-31T20:57:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FIA7nQDNWs", "description": "http://www.firstplaceparts.com/klim-elite-snowmobile-gloves.html\nKlim's Elite Glove represents the highest class of technology and performance ever included in snowmobile gloves.

In the world\u2019s eastern hemisphere, the total eclipse happens after sunset October 8.\n\nWhen is the October 2014 moon exactly full? \n\nGenerally speaking, we in the Americas will say the moon stays full all through the night tonight, October 7-8.\n\nMeanwhile, because of the difference in time zones, this same full moon happens at local midnight (October 7-8) for far-western Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It\u2019s sunrise (October 8) for northeastern North America and far-western South America, and it\u2019s sunset (October 8) in Asia.\n\nRead More Here:\nTotal eclipse of Blood Moon on night of October 7-8\nhttp://earthsky.org/tonight/total-lunar-eclipse-blood-moon-hunters-moon-october-7-8-2014\n\nECLIPSES DURING 2014\nhttp://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html", "title": "Total Lunar Eclipse on Night of October 8  2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-19T20:14:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FKTTe3fHhI", "description": "", "title": "Ronn-Esther", "publishedDate": "2009-05-05T09:54:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FKwZePPneY", "description": "", "title": "Sex Scene From The MOH Episode Haeckel's Tale", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T02:37:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FL5y0vmIEk", "description": "marshtini (loop. holes) - DOGSHIT\nhttps://soundcloud.com/marshtini/dogshit", "title": "marshtini (loop. holes) - DOGSHIT", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T03:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FLT83oqUWY", "description": "Propeller planes are staging a comeback, as airlines look to make savings over more expensive jets.

Mit diesen wurde er im Jahre 1670 in den Dritten Orden der Karmeliter aufgenommen und erhielt den Namen Frater Onuphrius. Die Einsiedler fanden in den weiteren Jahren immer mehr Anh\u00e4ger, doch es fehlte ihnen an einer geeigneten Eremitenklause. Am 27. und 28. September 1689 konnte am Walchensee die Einweihung des Herzst\u00fcckes des Eremitoriums der Klosterkapelle St. Anna, die sich \u00fcber zwei Stockwerke hinzog, vorgenommen werden. Die Eremiten mussten 1725 aufgrund von Streitigkeiten mit der Bev\u00f6lkerung von Walchensee das Kl\u00f6sterl verlassen, welches dann vom Kloster Benediktbeuern \u00fcbernommen wurde.\n\nDas Kl\u00f6sterl war ab der S\u00e4kularisation 1803 die Wohnung des Pfarrers von Walchensee und Jachenau. 1968 zog der letzte Pfarrer vom Kl\u00f6sterl aus. Fast 10 Jahre stand das Kl\u00f6sterl dann leer, trotz privater Kaufinteressen, die das Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege ablehnte. In dieser Zeit wurde das Kl\u00f6sterl durch Einbr\u00fcche arg verw\u00fcstet und durch Antiquit\u00e4tenr\u00e4uber systematisch ausgepl\u00fcndert. In den Jahren 1979/80 veranlasste die Di\u00f6zese Augsburg die grundlegende Renovierung des Kl\u00f6sterls. Im Mai 1989 belegte dann die erste Gruppe das Kl\u00f6sterl als Jugendhaus, was es bis heute geblieben ist.\n\nDer kleine Turm des Kl\u00f6sterls beherbergt keine Glocken. Der Glockenstuhl ist im Garten des Kl\u00f6sterls im Wald aufgestellt.

Rendon, a Bank One employee was kidnapped from a Chevron station and driven to a desolate area. in the 9300 block of Kniight Road. Campbell and a co-defendant Leroy Lewis robbed her of her money and jewelry and then raped her. Rendon was then marched at gunpoint to a field and then told by Campbell to run. Campbell shot once at the woman's head but missed. He then shot her in the back and left her to die. Both then fled the scene in her car. Lewis later gave police a taped confession. Rendon's body was found 12 days after she was shot. \n\nCampbell had been to prison for a robbery in Harris County. He was given 5-years and entered TDCJ on April 30, 1990.He was released on parole less than 4 months later on August 22, 1990. Four months later Rendon was dead. \n\nHis co-defendant Leroy Lewis was sent to TDCJ on August 26, 1993 after receiving 35-years for kidnapping with a deadly weapon, robbery with a deadly weapon and murder with a deadly weapon. He has since been paroled and lives in northwest Houston. He also must register as a sex offender for life. \n\nHours before Texas could carry out the nation's first execution since Oklahoma officials botched a lethal injection last month,  the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a dramatic unanimous ruling Tuesday that halted Robert Campbell's execution and granted him a new appeal.\n\nThe court cited new defense evidence that Campbell is intellectually disabled, with an IQ of 69 \u2014 below the minimum threshold set by most courts that would make it unconstitutional for him to be executed. \n\nHis attorneys had appealed to the courts and to Gov. Rick Perry for a stay of execution on two main grounds: that Campbell suffers from intellectual disability and that he is entitled to know the details of the state's execution procedures, which have not been fully disclosed.\n\nThe attorneys argued that Texas should especially be compelled to disclose the details of its lethal injection procedure in light not only of Oklahoma's botched execution, but problems with other lethal injections. They noted that when Jose Villegas, 39, was executed last month in Texas for murdering his girlfriend, he complained of burning, as did an Oklahoma inmate executed in January.\n\nUnlike Oklahoma who uses three separate drugs, Texas uses only one. \n\n\"Campbell and his attorneys have not had a fair opportunity to develop Campbell's claim of ineligibility for the death penalty,\" the court wrote. \"In light of the evidence we have been shown, we believe that Campbell must be given such an opportunity.\"\n\nCampbell's execution would have been the eighth this year in Texas, which puts more inmates to death than any other state \u2014 515 since lethal injections began in 1982. In fact, Texas has executed more inmates than the next half-dozen busiest death penalty states combined (Virginia, Oklahoma, Florida, Missouri, Alabama and Georgia).", "title": "051314 HUNTSVILLE EXECUTION HALTED", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T02:42:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ffzs-hGQ2o", "description": "Choose Yes: A PSA on Organ Donation\n~WON \"Best Short\" at Western Kentucky Film Festival\n\nProduced by Madison O'Shields and Chaz Olivier\nWritten, Directed and Edited by Madison O'Shields\nDirector of Photography, Assistant Editor and Colorist: Chaz Olivier\n\nCast(in order of appearance)\n\nLunchroom Boy: Johnathan Rankin\nLunchroom Girl: Claire Deaver\n\nJerk Dude: Blake Pugh\nTroubled Teen: Michael Day\n\nHospital Patient: Ivy Rhodes\nHospital Friend: Aaron Mirtes \n\nShot on a Canon t3i, using the similaar picture style \"Flaat 10\"\n\nLenses:\nTakumar 55mm f1.8\nNikon 80-200 f4\nNikon 24mm f2.8\n\nEdited in Premiere Pro\nTranscoded with 5dtoRGB\nColor Graded in Davinci Resolve", "title": "Choose Yes: A PSA on Organ Donation", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T21:54:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FgELPKQAs4", "description": "I called my friend Megan and yeahh", "title": "Blondness", "publishedDate": "2011-05-22T20:16:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FgFxsQXCio", "description": "For more Game Fails visit http://www.youtube.com/gamefails\n\nGot something funnier?\nSubmit your clips now at http://ahuploads.com\nFails from all games accepted!\n\nSubmitted by: xxTDGPainxx", "title": "Game Fails: Assassin's Creed 2 \"Desynchronized\"", "publishedDate": "2012-06-16T05:32:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FgGU3MyeZY", "description": "Looool \n\u064a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0634\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0639\u0627\u062e\u0639", "title": "Muhammad Alhanshali", "publishedDate": "2013-01-25T20:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FgqY_x56fE", "description": "Download \"First Flight Home\" on iTunes HERE: http://smarturl.it/FFHiTunes\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jakemiller\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jakemillermusic\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/jakemiller\nManagement: Frank@23-management.com \nBooking: Mark Cheatham - Creative Artists Agency - mark.cheatham@caa.com - 212.277.9000\n\nListen to Jake Miller on Beats Music: https://listen.beatsmusic.com/artists/ar1526655 \n\nMusic video by Jake Miller performing First Flight Home. \u00a9 Warner Brothers Records.", "title": "Jake Miller - First Flight Home (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T10:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FgvqG8Gz0c", "description": "Curious Ad\u00e9lie penguin pecking at my camera.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats reprise)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T03:36:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FnaTWZDHD8", "description": "After an intense week, we've finally made the final table of six for the 2009 WPT Merit Cyprus Classic Poker Tournament.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Tips on How to Learn Hindi Online For Free", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T13:44:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FpaDCiFXMI", "description": "", "title": "21 Bottom DMI Plow", "publishedDate": "2012-11-17T18:23:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FpdIYvF_HI", "description": "Chef Patron Enrico Crippa prepares a dessert together with his pastry chef at 2 Michelin star Piazza Duomo in Alba, Piedmont, Italy.

The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. Some exceptionally large cultivars of squash with similar appearance have also been derived from Cucurbita maxima. Specific cultivars of winter squash derived from other species, including C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata, are also sometimes called \"pumpkin\". In New Zealand and Australian English, the term \"pumpkin\" generally refers to the broader category called winter squash elsewhere.\nPumpkins, like other squash, are native to North America. Pumpkins are widely grown for commercial use, and are used both in food and recreation. Pumpkin pie, for instance, is a traditional part of Thanksgiving meals in the United States, although commercially canned pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie fillings are usually made from different kinds of winter squash than the pumpkins frequently carved as jack o'lanterns for decoration around Halloween.\nPumpkins, like other squash, are thought to have originated in North America. The oldest evidence, pumpkin-related seeds dating between 7000 and 5500 BC, were found in Mexico.\nSince some squash share the same botanical classifications as pumpkins, the names are frequently used interchangeably. One often used botanical classification relies on the characteristics of the stems: pumpkin stems are more rigid, prickly, and angular (with an approximate five-degree angle) than squash stems, which are generally softer, more rounded, and more flared where joined to the fruit.\nTraditional C. pepo pumpkins generally weigh between 6 and 18 pounds (2.7 and 8.2 kg), though the largest cultivars (of the species C. maxima) regularly reach weights of over 75 pounds (34 kg).\n\nThe color of pumpkins is derived from the orange pigments abundant in them. The main nutrients are lutein and both alpha and beta carotene, the latter of which generates vitamin A in the body.\nThe word pumpkin originates from the word pepon (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd), which is Greek for \"large melon\", something round and large. The French adapted this word to pompon, which the British changed to pumpion and later American colonists changed that to the word that is used today, \"pumpkin\".\nThe term \"pumpkin\" as it applies to winter squash has different meanings depending on variety and vernacular. In many areas, including North America and the United Kingdom, \"pumpkin\" traditionally refers to only certain round, orange varieties of winter squash, predominantly derived from Cucurbita pepo, while in Australian English, \"pumpkin\" can refer to winter squash of any appearance.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin", "title": "Pumpkin Plantation in rooftop net", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T21:31:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Fy6ssU9m-E", "description": "Kurt Hugo Schneider directs Rixton's one-take music video for their hit single \"Me and My Broken Heart\".\n\nUSA: Download the Me and My Broken Heart EP on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/MyBrokenHeart \n\nUK: Pre-order 'Me and My Broken Heart', out 7/13 http://smarturl.it/MyBrokenHeart \n\nhttp://RixtonBand.com \nhttp://youtube.com/Rixton \nhttp://twitter.com/RixtonOfficial\nhttp://facebook.com/RixtonOfficial\nhttp://instagram.com/RixtonOfficial", "title": "Rixton - Me and My Broken Heart (One-Take)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T18:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7FyIQ6Sdrpg", "description": "For detail study and animations go to http://www.sinhalab.com\nI turned my chair to the fire [after having worked on the problem for some time] and dozed.

It normally takes place in the ampullary region of the uterine tube.\nShortly after ejaculation, spermatozoa swim from the vagina to the uterine cavity via the cervix, propelled by whip-like motions of their flagella. \nOf the 200 million spermatozoa found in each ejaculation, approximately 3-5 hundred will reach the secondary oocyte.\nThe secondary oocyte cannot be fertilized until capacitation and the acrosomal reaction have taken place, which can take several hours. \nDuring capacitation, two changes occur to the spermatozoa. First, the flagella beat more quickly triggered by the accompanying seminal secretions. \nSecond, vaginal secretions promote the removal of glycoproteins and seminal plasma proteins from the heads of the spermatozoa, resulting in the membrane becoming more fluid, in preparation for the events of fertilization. \nA spermatozoon must penetrate two layers before it can fertilize the secondary oocyte. These layers are the corona radiata, composed of granulosa cells and the deeper zona pellucida, made up of glycoproteins. \nSpermatozoa penetrate down to the zona pellucida where they bind to a sperm-receptor molecule called ZP3 glycoprotein,  triggering the acrosomal reaction. \nDuring this process, the acrosome releases acrosomal enzymes, which digest the zona pellucida and allow the spermatozoa to cross the perivitelline space, the space between the zona pellucida and the oocyte membrane.\nThe head of the first spermatozoon to reach the plasma membrane of the secondary oocyte fuses with it. Fusion of the spermatozoon and oocyte membranes activates two mechanisms that help prevent polyspermy, or fertilization of the secondary oocyte by more than one spermatozoon. These are a fast and a slow block to polyspermy. \nDuring fast block to polyspermy, the oocyte membrane depolarizes, preventing other spermatozoa from fusing with the membrane. This activity stimulates slow block to polyspermy.\nDuring slow block to polyspermy, a wave of intracellular calcium is released, causing the secondary oocyte to release cortical granules by exocytosis, rendering ZP3 inactive, and making the zona pellucida impermeable.\nImmediately after the fusion of the spermatozoon and oocyte membranes, the nucleus of the spermatozoon containing haploid genetic material and associated centrioles is released into the cytoplasm of the secondary oocyte.\nUpon the spermatozoon entering, the oocyte undergoes meiosis II, and develops into the female pronucleus. During this time, the tail of the sperm detaches and degenerates, and the spermatic nucleus develops into the male pronucleus. The two pronuclei then fuse to form a single cell with a diploid nucleus. This cell is known as a zygote.", "title": "General Embryology - Detailed Animation On Fertilization", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T11:25:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7G32q4V4qfA", "description": "", "title": "Kara Tointon & Artem Chigvintsev - Charleston- Strictly Come Dancing - Week 4", "publishedDate": "2010-10-24T10:09:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7G3RpPR6UQw", "description": "http://instatour.propertypanorama.com/instaview/mfr/T2539736 is the place to go if you are seeking listings near WESLEY CHAPEL Florida.

Its architecture is a composition of four continuous, flowing volumes that are set apart, fused or linked by stretched bridges. These volumes adapt to each other in all directions, generating a panoramic architecture without corners or abrupt transitions that break the fluidity of its formal composition.\n\nThe great interior courts of the project are a reflection of traditional Chinese architecture where courtyards create an internal world of continuous open spaces. Here, the architecture is no longer composed of rigid blocks, but instead comprised of volumes which coalesce to create a world of continuous mutual adaptation and fluid movement between each building. Shifting plateaus within the design impact upon each other to generate a deep sense of immersion and envelopment. As users enter deeper into the building, they discover intimate spaces that follow the same coherent formal logic of continuous curvelinearity.\n\nThe lower three levels of Galaxy SOHO house public facilities for retail and entertainment. The levels immediately above provide work spaces for clusters of innovative businesses. The top of the building is dedicated to bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s that offer views along one of the greatest avenues of the city.

Not only is there a reboot of Sailor Moon, but Revo composed the main theme too?  This is too much for me to handle.  This was all done entirely by ear, so sadly, I don't have any tabs or sheet music, or anything of the sort.  However, I can say with safety that if this video gets popular enough, I'd be willing to make tablature, or do a tutorial video on how to play the very cool parts of this killer tune!\n\nSome backstory on the process of how I went about making this:\n\nAfter hearing the opening in bits and pieces from a video recorded on somebody's cellphone, I knew right then that I HAD to cover this track.  It's very reminiscent of Revo's style, and I could tell right away from the chorus, progressions, and orchestration that he was behind it.  I'm pretty damn tired right now too, as I figured this out within a period of two days, and have spent a crazy amount of time practicing, recording, and editing audio to make sure that I get a kick-ass end product!  Thanks so much for watching, I hope you all enjoy!\n\nJust a heads up: I'm going to be out for most of the day engaging in general 4th of July shenanigans / watching the Colombia vs Brazil game, so I may not be able to respond to comments for a bit!\n\nOh!

Hand cars are the human powered train cars from a bye-gone era and you'll see some of the traditional kind, but mostly some new-fangled kinetic sculptures based on hand cars.  In the words of the Public Address announcer, it's not about winning or losing, it's about showing up, and many of the hand cars that turned out were feats of imagination.  In fact, the competition is almost a sideline of the main event, people watching.  The costumes, sculptures, entertainment and music are a feast for the senses.\n\nAlso included is a first-hand account on team ZAP and the Alia... I mean Ale Car.  No, it's not an Ale-powered car, it's a pedal powered car, the creation of ZAP machinist Ben Conrad and ZAP founder Gary Starr.  Also thanks to other volunteers Justin, Brad, Craig, Ricky and Frederic for building the car in their spare time.  Did we forget anyone?  Well, the ZAP Ale Car was highly celebrated, but lost out in the semi-finals, apparently throwing a chain.  Good job battling the heat, the junk parts and the wildly dressed crowds.  \"More grueling than the X PRIZE,\" says team leader Gary Starr.

The first and probably more accurate sources we have, regarding the Druids, come from Ancient Rome and Greece. Some of them seem to be more reliable than others. The Druids were, that seems to be undisputed, the spiritual class, the sorcerers, of the Celts. Julius Ceasar paints them in both good, and bad colors. Regarding the good: the Druids were philosophers, who studied the stars, and were interested in their meaning. Also, they were close to the gods, and deities, and practiced magic. The druids also had a great amount of knowledge, regarding nature. The Druids, most likely, would also act like Judges and solve and decide about Judicial problems, and disputes. Both civil, and criminal. But they practiced human sacrifice, which was seen by the Romans, at the time, as a highly barbaric and savage ritual. All these accounts make sense. And they would also explain why the Romans occupied and turned Gaul into a Roman territory so quickly. There were probably lots of people who feared the sacrifices to the Gods. The \"wicker man\" is one of the most well known celtic/druidic human sacrifice. These happened mostly to improve crops. According to Caeasr, the Druid's main teaching was the concept of reincarnation. The druids taught that the soul does not die. Instead, migrates to another body. This is related to the Circle of Life, and of everything, for that mater. Universal concept, and highly studied, and symbolized within Heathen religions. A form of druidism survived in Britain, until the Christianization of the island. In a way, as happened with all ancient heathen wisdom, we can say it was transfered to common people who never stop searching for it, and studying wherever and whenever they could. Hence, the \"witches\", and \"sorcerers\", as the Christian Stablishment started to call those individuals, women or men. Besides today's France, and today's Great Britain, there were probably druids, or a similar class, within the Iberian Peninsula's Celtiberian settlements, at least during the Iron Age. In the end, regardless any label, to me, the word \"druid\" describes everyone who seeks knowledge and wisdom, from every source. There were probably many druids who were no druids at all, and others who didn't have the status, and should have had. Such is life, and different human natures. Today, and 2000 years ago. In any case, I dedicate this song to all of those, who, since the beggining of ages, dedicated - and dedicate - themselves to embrace that knowledge, the cosmic words and signs, plants, nature, ghosts, spirits, symbols and essences. Regardless what names they mant call themselves. Or be called, by others. \n\nYou can listen to some more of my music here:\n\nwww.reverbnation.com/weapon1143\n\nwww.reverbnation.com/weapon12\n\nFree downloads available.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in Norse Mythology, please visit:\n\nthecompleteguidetonorsemythology.blogspot.pt\n\nAny further questions, or doubts, feel free to contact me.\n\nRegards.", "title": "Medieval Music (Chapter About Druidism)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T17:08:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Gf_DgHkuMA", "description": "Crevcing for gold in Northern Georgia creek -- digging in the Saprolite bedrock cracks & crevices...sluiced & panned the material -- found some fine GA gold!", "title": "Crevicing For Georgia Gold", "publishedDate": "2008-12-20T17:33:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7GfeEUX3KFE", "description": "Stevie Wonder 14 years old in 1964 \nBrilliant performance from a Motown legend", "title": "Little Stevie Wonder - Fingertips", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T21:46:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Gfk634VjSE", "description": "Exotic Coach Caddy CTS (Pinnacle Limousine Mfg)", "title": "Exotic Coach Caddy CTS (Pinnacle Limousine Mfg)", "publishedDate": "2009-02-08T23:16:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Gg0OJii6Ug", "description": "Se desato una balacera entre la policia y maliantes el d\u00eda de hoy en villahermosa tabasco.", "title": "Balacera en villahermosa", "publishedDate": "2013-12-12T18:45:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7GgJYMg1LO8", "description": "Lapdog the best drummer ever talks about enlightenment!", "title": "Electric Apricot - Lapdog!!!", "publishedDate": "2007-12-06T01:18:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ggd5stjJsQ", "description": "http://www.piertech.com/products/helical-piers.html\n\nPierTech Systems is a leading manufacturer of helical piers and piles.

The first being just how far this country remains from any semblance of reality. It's the kind of delusional denial that truly can only be believed when witnessed from within. As Keith Olbermann was describing the cinematic quality of the \"Strykers driving into your living room,\" I could really think of only one thing -- The aftermath of a 7.5 year all out United States operation to decimate a people and their society.\n\nThere's no way to comprehend the scope and facets of this operation, because you would need a Pentagon for that. From the first day after initial conquest when the money disappeared from the banks and their record of civilization was decimated by the looting of their museums, it was like any other colonial conquest in history, except every excruciating moment of this one was on television. The following 7.5 years of the assimilation of a country went as diagrammed.\n\nFrom control (denial) of power, water, and even seed monopolization, to toxic contamination of the gene pool and re-education 'schools,' to monopolization of natural resources, to fostering drug addictions and self-perpetuating violence, etc., what took a hundred years to do to Native Americans was accomplished in under a decade. Quite an example of lessons learned from hundreds of years of colonization.\n\nAnd in the name of all that is Holy, please do not delude yourself into believing this war is over. 50,000 troops will remain, an 'unknowable' number of contractors / mercenaries, and an embassy that makes the Vatican look like the summer home will remain. Certainly, the colonization of Iraq was one of the fastest and most efficient in history. It also needs to be the last.\n\nSo there are no delusions of the reality we have left for the Iraqi people, please watch the short videos below. Then, while you're sitting with your family watching the MSM pundits debate whether the war was 'worth it' or not, think about how long you could survive the kind of 'Freedom' we have heaped on the Iraqis. Face the reality, and forget the cinema.\n\n1.5M Iraqi War Widows: http://ow.ly/2rBGR\n\nThe poisoning of Iraq: http://ow.ly/2rBJv\n\nIraq -- Unknown Illness Spreads: http://ow.ly/2rF0K\n\nIraq -- Another little girl's house gone: http://ow.ly/2rEYX\n\nStill no electricity in Baghdad: http://ow.ly/2rBJM\n\n\u2014\n\nBill Noxid http://billnoxid.wordpress.com/ Twitter http://twitter.com/attentionalert", "title": "Iraq: Unknown Illness Spreads", "publishedDate": "2009-03-13T12:36:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7GyrdLcf9vw", "description": "This setup uses 21 SS switch plate covers with the on/off opening switch hole in between the water in and gas out.

It worked well but it was very heavy to remove from the water. we also had to reapply the water proof after that with a few cans. I would use the concentrated liquid Lysol if I did it again.

This show, recorded shortly after the band released its popular live album, came with the momentum of a much ballyhooed appearance at California Jam in front of 600,000 crazy fans. \n\nA cross between Lynyrd Skynyrd and Thin Lizzy (with a touch of the Allmans thrown in for good, guitar-dueling measure), Black Oak Arkansas was spearheaded by their controversial front man, Jim Dandy Mangrum. Jim Dandy, as he was called, got the name at age 10 when his father nicknamed him from the 1950s LaVern Baker song \"Jim Dandy To The Rescue.\" Black Oak Arkansas would later have a #1 single with their own re-make of the song, after Mangrum got a personal call from Elvis Presley himself who recommended they cut it.\n\nSongs such as \"Hot and Nasty,\" \"Hot Rod,\" \"Hey Y'all\" and the aforementioned remake of \"Jim Dandy\" dominated the band's song list and have remained among their best loved songs. \n\nThe group started to wane in the late 1970s due mainly to the rigors of the road and the band's inability to remain innovative within an industry that was embracing disco and corporate rock. They continued throughout the '80s, leaving Atlantic Records for a short-lived career on MCA. Since that period, Mangrum has broken the band up and reformed it a number of times, remaining the figurehead. Sadly, backing vocalist Ruby Starr, who sang on the band's version of \"Jim Dandy To The Rescue\" died of a brain tumor in 1995.\n\n This show, recorded at Bill Graham's Winterland Ballroom, exudes sweat and energy and is not to be missed if you are a fan of BOA and their vivacious blend of hard southern rock.", "title": "Black Oak Arkansas - Jim Dandy (To The Rescue) - 3/30/1974 - Winterland (Official)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T16:10:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H1vzfOtwlk", "description": "Luuis Espinosa Films \ud83d\ude09 \u2764", "title": "E-Motion Chiapas Demo de Jury Buzz (Dirty vission)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T16:49:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H2R-SkQ9sA", "description": "Game Clip", "title": "Buddytang99 - Black Ops Game Clip", "publishedDate": "2011-06-15T11:23:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H39QzIcFsc", "description": "deja vu blueberry gape\nbest i have smoked todate", "title": "blueberry gape Hookah tobacco", "publishedDate": "2011-08-05T06:10:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H3LANCHnW0", "description": "Chelsea winger Victor Moses was non-committal on his Stamford Bridge future when quizzed about his hopes and aspirations moving forward.\n\nThe Nigeria international is currently enjoying a season-long loan stint with Stoke City after failing to make an impression on Jose Mourinho, who opted to farm the former Wigan Athletic star out to gain more regular first-team football.", "title": "Chelsea winger Victor Moses' non-committal on Stamford Bridge future", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T12:58:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H3pnTYq6n4", "description": "Saxon 1K in the undergrowth.

Rob was doing music way before Twilight.  ('I have been playing the piano for my entire life --since I was three or four and I used to play classical guitar from when I was about five to twelve years of age.  Then I didn't play guitar for years.  About four or five years ago, I got out the guitar again and just started playing blues and stuff'.  ~ Quote taken from \"The Robert Pattinson Album\" a biography by Paul Stenning.)  His voice is reminiscent of the likes of Van Morrison and Jeff Buckley (two of his favorite artists), hence his raw, bluesy, folksy sound.   Rob has a very soulful voice that touches you deep within....you can really feel it in this song....it gives me chills.   I selected pictures of him not smiling, somber,....he looks like he has a lot on his mind.  As far as the pictures of him smoking (don't judge!).....it just fit the mood of the song or at least my interpretation of it.   I imagined him at the beginning where you hear this gritty guitar chord, having a smoke out back to take the edge off, before going on stage to perform and of course having one to relax after performing.   He looks so James Dean.\n\nCheck out Rob's other songs on YouTube.  He has been recorded (unknowingly) singing in some clubs.  Look for the following songs; \"I Was Broken\", \"I'll Be Your Lover Too\", \"To Roam\", \"Stray Dog\", \"In Your Head\" and an almost full live version of \"Let Me Sign\".  Some recordings are clearer than others.  My favorite is \"I Was Broken\", he sings it with so much heart and soul!\n\nAs you may know, this bit was recorded specifically to be used for a scene (ballet studio) in the movie \"Twilight\".

Interpretations are subjective, but here is some food for thought.   My take is that a person is so enamored with another that they would \"sign\" their soul over to the devil just to be with the object of their desires even if for just one night.  \n\n*************************************************************************\nThe following are the official lyrics to the original song written by Marcus Foster and Bobby Long and can be found on their respective MySpace pages.\n\nShe was standing there by the broken tree\nHer hands were all twisted she was pointing at me\nI was damned by the light coming out of her eyes\nShe spoke with a voice that disrupted the sky\nShe said ' Come on over to the bitter shade,\nI will wrap you in my arms \nand you'll know you've been saved'\nLet me sign, let me sign, \ncan't fight the devil so just let me sign.\n\nI was out for a drink in a soho bar\nThe air was smoked out liked a cheap cigar\nShe rose out of her seat like a painted ghost\nShe was the woman that I wanted the most\nAs she reached for my arm I gave her my hand\nI said 'Lay me down easy let me understand'\nLet me sign, let me sign, \ncan't fight the devil so just let me sign.\n\nAs I walked through the door \nshe was still in my head\nAs I entered the room she was laid there in bed \nShe reached out for me all twisted in black\nI was on my way down, never coming back\nlet me sign, let me sign, \ncan't fight the devil so just let me sign.\nlet me sign, let me sign, \ncan't fight the devil so just let me sign.", "title": "Robert Pattinson - \"Let Me Sign\" (w/Lyrics in \"more info\")", "publishedDate": "2009-01-06T11:26:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7H49FKQ8afk", "description": "En el concurso por unos puntos.

Prowadzi samotniczy, drapie\u017cny tryb \u017cycia. Wyr\u00f3\u017cnia si\u0119 liczne podgatunki. W Polsce podlega \u015bcis\u0142ej ochronie, jako gatunek wymagaj\u0105cy ochrony czynnej.\nNazwa:\nPolska, jak i \u0142aci\u0144ska nazwa tego stworzenia prawdopodobnie si\u0119ga rodowodem j\u0119zyka perskiego, w kt\u00f3rym znaczy \"\u017cyj\u0105ca w ogniu\".

Zaproponowano mi\u0119dzy innymi nazw\u0119 S. maculosa. Kolejna nazwa Lacerta salamandra pojawi\u0142a si\u0119 m.in. w 10. wydaniu linneuszowskiego Systema Naturae. Rodzaj, w kt\u00f3rym znajduje si\u0119 dzi\u015b, przywr\u00f3ci\u0142 jej Joseph Nicolai Laurenti.

Dobrze sobie radzi w \u015brodowisku zmienionym, widuje si\u0119 j\u0105 nawet w ogrodach. Szczeg\u00f3lnie lubi lasy bukowe, iglastych za\u015b unika, podobnie jak gleb wapiennych, w przeciwie\u0144stwie do piaskowc\u00f3w, margli, a wg niekt\u00f3rych te\u017c granit\u00f3w. Bytuje tak\u017ce w otoczeniu ro\u015blinno\u015bci \u015br\u00f3dziemnomorskiej. Zamieszkuje g\u0142\u00f3wnie okolice podg\u00f3rskie (lasy pog\u00f3rza, regiel dolny), w Alpach dochodzi zwykle do wys. 800 m n.p.m., a w polskich Karpatach i Sudetach od 250 do 1087 m n.p.m., nie licz\u0105c Tatr -- tam do 1000, rzadko 1300 m n.p.m.. Zaproponowano, i\u017c obecno\u015b\u0107 tego ogoniastego na g\u00f3rskich pastwiskach mo\u017ce oznacza\u0107, \u017ce w przesz\u0142o\u015bci porasta\u0142 je las.\nZachowanie:\nSalamandra plamista to zwierz\u0119 wyj\u0105tkowo wilgociolubne. Prowadzi samotny tryb \u017cycia, chocia\u017c kilka, a nawet kilkadziesi\u0105t osobnik\u00f3w mo\u017ce zimowa\u0107 w jednym miejscu. Jej aktywno\u015b\u0107 przypada na noc. Wyj\u0105tek stanowi\u0105 samice podczas sezonu rozrodczego i zwierz\u0119ta obu p\u0142ci podczas deszczowej pogody. Dzie\u0144 zwierz\u0119 to zazwyczaj sp\u0119dza pod k\u0142odami, w norach, rozpadlinach i wykrotach. Kryje si\u0119 tak\u017ce po\u015br\u00f3d mchu. Potrafi wykopa\u0107 tunel d\u0142ugi na 40 cm, przy czym jego szeroko\u015b\u0107 wynosi zwykle 4-6 cm. Na \u0142owy wychodzi tylko noc\u0105 lub w ciep\u0142e pochmurne i deszczowe dni. Nie znosi upa\u0142\u00f3w (jest wtedy nadzwyczaj osowia\u0142a i apatyczna). W ciep\u0142ym klimacie to na lato przypada spadek aktywno\u015bci tego ogoniastego. Poluje g\u0142\u00f3wnie na sk\u0105poszczety i nagie \u015blimaki. W czasie polowania porusza si\u0119 bardzo niezgrabnie, wi\u0119c owady, paj\u0119czaki lub wije udaje si\u0119 jej z\u0142apa\u0107 tylko wyj\u0105tkowo. Bez po\u017cywienia mo\u017ce oby\u0107 si\u0119 kilka tygodni. Zaskoczona nie ratuje si\u0119 ucieczk\u0105, lecz zamiera w bezruchu. P\u0142ywa bardzo kiepsko, a w przypadku stromych brzeg\u00f3w zbiornika nie mo\u017ce si\u0119 wydosta\u0107 i umiera. Poniewa\u017c ma stosunkowo silny jad oraz odstraszaj\u0105ce ubarwienie i prowadzi nocny tryb \u017cycia, ma relatywnie niewielu wrog\u00f3w. Zaliczaj\u0105 si\u0119 do nich \u0142ososiowate i gatunek raka Procambarus clarkii. Salamandra zapada w sen zimowy do\u015b\u0107 p\u00f3\u017ano, na prze\u0142omie pa\u017adziernika i listopada, a nieraz na pocz\u0105tku grudnia. Czasem wykazuje aktywno\u015b\u0107 nawet w czasie grudniowych ocieple\u0144. Na wiosn\u0119 p\u0142aza tego spotyka si\u0119 ju\u017c w marcu.\nW kulturze:\nZwierz\u0119 to znane jest cz\u0142owiekowi od dawna. Wzmiankuj\u0105 o nim stare kroniki. W przesz\u0142o\u015bci wierzono, \u017ce salamandry rodz\u0105 si\u0119 i \u017cyj\u0105 w ogniu. Przes\u0105d ten spowodowa\u0142y liczne obserwacje ucieczki zwierz\u0105t kryj\u0105cych si\u0119 po\u015br\u00f3d drew rozpalanego ogniska.\nIstniej\u0105 doniesienia o u\u017cywaniu toksyn z gruczo\u0142\u00f3w tych stworze\u0144 jako pomoc w medytacji, podczas wchodzenia w trans i dla uzyskania halucynacji.\nPodobnie jak niski lot jask\u00f3\u0142ki, spotkanie tego p\u0142aza w dzie\u0144 wi\u0105zano z nadej\u015bciem deszczu.\nSalamandra plamista stanowi symbol Pog\u00f3rza Kaczawskiego. Znajduje si\u0119 te\u017c w logo Gorcza\u0144skiego Parku Narodowego. W okolicach Tatr p\u0142azy te nazywa si\u0119 jaszczurami. Dzi\u0119ki temu ciep\u0142e \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142a, gdzie w przesz\u0142o\u015bci cz\u0119sto je widywano, otrzyma\u0142y nazw\u0119 Jaszczur\u00f3wki. Podobnie wygl\u0105da etymologia nazwy miejscowo\u015bci Jaszczurzyce le\u017c\u0105cej blisko Orawic. Nazwa zwierz\u0119cia pojawia si\u0119 r\u00f3wnie\u017c w tytu\u0142ach czasopism i nazwach organizacji (jak np.

As a young child, Pitka is abandoned at the gates of an ashram in India and taken in by kindly gurus. An American by birth, Pitka absorbs the lessons taught to him by his teachers and later returns to the United States to become a leading authority on spirituality and self-help. While Pitka's methods are decidedly unorthodox, they may be the only means of ensuring that the Toronto Maple Leafs win the coveted Stanley Cup. Maple Leafs star Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) is in trouble. His estranged wife has recently begun dating L.A. Kings star Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) in a vengeful effort to send her husband's career into a tailspin, and when Roanoke starts to falter on the ice, the whole team starts to suffer. As their visions of leading the Maple Leafs to the Stanley Cup are quickly going up in flames, team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) and Coach Cherkov (Verne Troyer) enlist the aid of the world's best-known relationship expert in restoring the peace between Roanoke and his wife, and getting their team back on track to the championships.\n\n\"the love guru\",\"the love guru clip\",\"the love guru funny scenes\",\"the love guru part 1\",\"justin timberlake\",\"meagan good\",\"marco schnabel\",\"letter videos\",\"sports comedies\",comedy,\"late night comedies\",satires,\"spoofs and satire\",\"roger birnbaum\",\"michael de luca\",\"donald j lee jr\",\"mike myers\",\"alli shearmur\",\"graham gordy\",\"sean gannet\",\"conflict videos\",\"determination videos\",\"risk videos\",\"house videos\",\"pool videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++389227,/m/0p__8,/m/0j1yf,/m/01xg_w", "title": "The Love Guru (3/9) Movie CLIP - Smuggling a Schnauzer (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T23:21:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7HHPPs86MX0", "description": "300 g de chocolat blanc\n200 g de cr\u00e8me liquide\n1 gousse de vanille\n\n300 g of white chocolate\n200 g cream\n1 vanilla pod\nMusique G\u00e9n\u00e9rique: \nhttp://www.musicscreen.be", "title": "cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e vanille et chocolat blanc ( CUISINERAPIDE)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T16:58:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7HHQ_oBQWqM", "description": "ZippO - \u041a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0447\u0438\u043a  \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b.\n\u0421\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0435\u043c,\u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c,\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c,\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0441\u044f. \n\u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430:http://vk.com/zippo_official\n\u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c:http://vk.com/id43077685\nyoutube:https://www.youtube.com/user/RapOfficialZippo\n\u0421\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438:\nhttps://youpartnerwsp.com/join?9526\n========\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 ========\n\u041a\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 Webmoney:\nU448914986808 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\nZ624025910772 \u0414\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u044b\nE313383950372 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e \nR404010325059 \u0420\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\n=================================", "title": "ZippO \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438 \u0435\u0451 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0443", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T07:47:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7HHedek5Y-M", "description": "Great things come in small packages.\n\nPost to Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1k0Rs2p\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1ilcE7k\nPost to Twitter: http://bit.ly/1k0RtDq\n\nMusic:\nGot The Look\nMusic Licensed Via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCredits:\n\nhuman hand with tape-measure and set of pieces\nAndrey_Kuzmin / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeasuring a man\nJozsef Szasz-Fabian / Thickstockphotos.com\n\nSexy young man with measure tape\nAntonioGuillem / Thickstockphotos.com\n\n2014 MTV Movie Awards - Show\nFrederick M.

Tre ingredienti per studiare la vita.\n\nChe il pomodoro di Pachino, lIgp su cui si regge buona parte delleconomia di una vasta area a  sud della Sicilia, godesse di importanti propriet\u00e0 salutistiche era cosa gi\u00e0 nota. Ma che il licopene, la sostanza di cui \u00e8 ricchissimo, fosse fondamentale per la lotta ad alcuni tumori, \u00e8 invece una scoperta recente resa possibile solo dalle nuove tecnologie e dalla bioinformatica, scienza nata per lo studio del genoma umano. Per studiare il genoma sono nate scienze che riescono ad analizzare il corredo genetico, proteico e metabolico di ogni singola cellula  precisa Giuseppe Carruba, direttore dell Unit\u00e0 operativa di oncologia sperimentale del dip. Oncologico dellospedale civico di Palerm - e che possono darci informazioni preziose, prendere le impronte digitali di ogni singola patologia, non solo quella tumorale,  e consentire di sviluppare dei percorsi terapeutici personalizzatiIl progetto MeDiet , elaborato dalloncologia sperimentale del dipartimento oncologico dellospedale civico di Palermo, \u00e8 un lavoro unico al mondo, finalizzato a studiare limpatto della dieta mediterranea sui geni. I primi risultati sono relativi ad un gruppo di ricerca sottoposto ad un particolare regime alimentare che prevede la presenza di pomodoro pachino. I nostri nonni ce lo dicevano delle peculiarit\u00e0 alimentari di questo prodotto  commenta Roberto Iodice, commissario ex Agensud del Ministero dellAgricoltura - ora arriva il sigillo di unautorevole conferma scientifica.Lrna viene estratto dal sangue, e convertito in dna. Il dna della persona sotto osservazione, marcato con gruppi chimici fluorescenti che possono essere rilevati da uno scanner, viene messo su dei vetrini e confrontato con i cosiddetti cancer genes, i geni cancerogeni, ovviamente invisibili ad occhio nudo. Se sul monitor il confronto evidenzia un colore verde il gene \u00e8 ipoespresso, ovvero, il confronto \u00e8 positivo. Il licopene, lo spazzino dei radicali liberi, \u00e8 il valore aggiunto di un prodotto che anche scientificamente si dimostra dunque un presidio di salute. I risultati del progetto Mediet, che \u00e8 gi\u00e0 arrivato alla fase 2, al momento parlano chiaro: il giusto consumo di pomodoro Pachino, soprattutto se associato allolio doliva, dunque piena dieta mediterranea, riduce del 45% il rischio del cancro della mammella.\n\nhttp://neapolis.blog.rai.it/2009/12/16/caccia-alloro-rosso-nea-polis-16112009/", "title": "TgR Neapolis 16-12-2009", "publishedDate": "2010-01-16T16:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7HNwXczQD6w", "description": "Drunk guy keeps falling over", "title": "Drunk Stumbler", "publishedDate": "2006-07-26T19:03:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7HOBP8D-KqE", "description": "Stage.TV: http://videos.stage-entertainment.de/ \nOffizielle Website & Tickets:  http://www.stage-entertainment.de/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DasPhantomDerOperDasMusical\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/@StageGermany \n\nHamburg, 17.

Hope you like it.\n\nWholesale Soybean Massage Candle has been carefully blended using only pure essential oils and natural plant waxes. Jojoba oil adds a tactile and luxury feel to this warm wax massage. \nThe ingredients are extremely rich and moisturising so a little will go a long way. Ideal for rubbing into those dry skin areas to replenish and nourish the skin. Made with the finest natural blend of waxes and only pure essential oils.\nSo turn down the lights set the mood with some relaxing music. Ensure the room is warm and you have soft towels and warm hands. \nWe hope you and your customers enjoy this unique  and sensual massage candles. \n\nHow to use:\nIt is important for your pleasure and safety that you read these instructions carefully.\nFirstly don't worry that the wax will burn you. This special natural wax blend has a very low melting point, it will melt at around 45C which is like warm bath water.\nLight the candle and allow to burn for ten minutes or until a pool of wax forms. When a pool of wax appears, blow out the flame and wait for a minute or so (some experienced massage therapists use the wax while the candle still burns). The wax will be warm but not hot enough to burn the skin. Now you can pour directly from the jar on to the skin. The warm oil creates an especially tactile and sensual experience. \nWarnings:\nAs with all  massage preparations we highly recommend that you test as small area of skin first, to ensure that the person being massaged does not have an allergic reaction.\nNot recommended for use on the face. Take special care to avoid contact with eyes.

Thus, Golem Arcana combines the tactile fun of a tabletop game with the accessibility of an online game. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, offering up a unique experience that neither could deliver on its own.\n\nThe key to the game\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Bluetooth-powered Tabletop Digital Interface (TDI) Stylus. You can tap any of the game pieces with the stylus to send information to the Golem Arcana app running on your smartphone or tablet.

Blanchard cited three reasons for why he thinks gold could climb to $1,600 an ounce by year end, all of which have to do with the fundamentals.\n\n1. A gold short squeeze appears to be in play, Blanchard said. In other words, many investors sold gold short in hopes that its price would plunge, but the price of gold has been climbing for several sessions now. So the shorts must cover their trade, meaning they must buy back the gold position they shorted and take a loss, since they now have to buy gold at a higher price.\n\n2. An increase in gold demand from China and India has been another catalyst for gold, Blanchard said. China's consumption of gold in the first half surged by more than 50%, reinforcing expectations that the nation will overtake India as the world's top gold consumer this year, the China Gold Association said in a statement on its website on Monday.\n\n3. The biggest driver for gold prices, though, is the expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at near zero, Blanchard said. Also whether or not the Fed will taper its $85 billion per month in quantitative easing. \n\nFind more price forecasts by Jim Rogers, Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Max Keiser, Gerald Celente, David Morgan, Bill Murphy, James Rickards and Eric Sprott here: http://dailysilverupdate.com/price-predictions/", "title": "2014 Price Forecast - Where Will Gold Be By Year End?

Las hembras son mucho m\u00e1s largas que los machos. El cuerpo es medianamente robusto, la cabeza grande, bien diferenciada y claramente triangular vista dorsalmente. Las escamas dorsales est\u00e1n fuertemente quilladas.  El color de fondo es gris oscuro, caf\u00e9 o verde oliva, con un patr\u00f3n dorsal distintivo que consiste en una serie de dise\u00f1os triangulares a ambos lados del cuerpo, vistos dorsalmente los dise\u00f1os recuerdan una letra X, raz\u00f3n por la que en gran parte de su distribuci\u00f3n la especie es conocida tambi\u00e9n como serpiente equis. La terciopelo se distingue tambi\u00e9n por la presencia de bandas pos-oculares a cada lado de su cabeza.  La especie es vivipara y muy fecunda, pudiendo dar a luz hasta 90 cr\u00edas. Su alta fecundidad explica en parte por qu\u00e9 la terciopelo es una de las serpientes m\u00e1s abundantes del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s, es una especie que se adapta a ambientes perturbados, lo que explica que sea responsable de m\u00e1s del 50% de los accidentes of\u00eddicos en la regi\u00f3n. La terciopelo se distribuye por el Caribe desde el noreste de M\u00e9xico hasta Venezuela, y desde el Pacifico Central de Costa Rica hasta las tierras bajas del Pac\u00edfico de Colombia y Ecuador.

A bit about American Coots shown in video: Their body is all black and it's beak is white-chicken-like which distinguishes it from real ducks. Also, these Birds have toes with lobes, not webbed feet like a duck. Habitat - lakes & ponds, Food - plants. The American Alligator is a reptile, AKA Gator, Habitat: Wetlands (the lowcountry), fresh water and brackish water, The Refuge was established in 1927, has 29,000 acres of fresh water marshes, tidal rivers, bottomland hardwoods, sandhill ridges, & diverse wildlife,  which are great  alligator habit loaded with prey.  Male alligators usually do not grow larger than 14.5 feet and females 9.8 feet. As I walked the area, more and more Alligators began surfacing. I made sure not to get too close to the edges of the marsh thinking an alligator could be nesting on the edge of the marsh. A combination of gusty winds and light rain made filming difficult.

We are warriors who fight with the strength of the falcons claw and ascend to the heavens on the wings of the same. We remember with the clarity of falcon-sight the words of Kerensky. Through the smoke of time he speaks to us, his chosen, and urges us onward with the promise of Eden. We will retake what is ours by right, that shining jewel Terra. Not the vastness of space nor the Wolf's obstinate howl will stay us from our righteous goal. We are Crusaders and will trample all who stand in our way!\"\n\nClan Description\n\nThe strictly traditionalist Crusaders of Clan Jade Falcon have long resented and been envious of Clan Wolf for their strength, holdings, and (most of all) possession of the coveted Kerensky Bloodname. The Jade Falcons participated in the initial invasion of the Inner Sphere and seized many Lyran worlds from the Federated Commonwealth. \n\nThey were the first Clan to taste defeat at the hands of Inner Sphere forces, losing on Twycross in 3050. Achieving a draw with the ComGuards on Tukayyid, they schemed and plotted to undo the Truce. \n\nThey were nearly destroyed by their Refusal War with the Wolves in an attempt to do just that. They lost many warriors and both of their Khans in subsequent politicking. Their new khan launched a daring strike at Coventry in the Lyran Alliance and managed to restore the Jade Falcons' strength by winning possession of other Crusader units in the Harvest Trials.\n\n The Jade Falcons beat the ComGuards during the Great Refusal on Strana Mechty and then pushed the Steel Vipers out of their Occupation Zone; after that, they seized (and lost) several more Lyran worlds during the FedCom Civil War. They still eye Terra and have not given up hope of claiming it.\n\nPlease Rate, Comment, Subscribe and Enjoy!", "title": "MechWarrior 2: Clan Jade Falcon (Intro)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T10:42:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IAmghIYIF4", "description": "How Inductive Filter Suppresses High-Frequency Noise Electromagnetic noise filters are designed to suppress high-frequency noise generated by the signal source or caused by the external electromagnetic field. Noise is suppressed due to frequency properties of a capacitor or an inductance coil.Let's consider how an inductive filter suppresses high-frequency noise. An inductive element is serially connected to the noisy circuit. The higher frequency is, the greater the impedance will be. This mitigates or suppresses noise.In such a case you can use general-purpose inductors as EMI filters. However, you might face the risk of resonance in inductor-containing circuits and the risk of wanted signal distortion.High-frequency mode properties of inductors used in EMI filter manufactured by Murata are close to those of resistors. Firstly, this reduces the risk of spurious oscillations and, secondly, prevents from distorting the form of the wanted signal.The figure shows the comparative analysis of capacitor and inductive EMI filters. You can see that damping caused by the capacitor filter at a given frequency is greater than that of the inductive filter.However, it is of no surprise given the design of Murata capacitor filters.", "title": "How Inductive Filter Suppresses High-Frequency Noise", "publishedDate": "2010-12-01T10:50:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IArAa5mjvg", "description": "\u4e2d\u5713\u5bf5\u7269-\u5357\u5d01\u5e97\n0926376535 \u5c0f\u66c4\n\n\u85cd\u5e7b\u5f69\u9713\u8679 \n\uff1aRainbow shiner\n\u5b78\u540d\uff1aNotropis chrosomus\n\u79d1: cyprinidae\u9ca4\u79d1\n\u76ee: Cypriniformes(carps)\u9ca4\u5f62\u76ee\n\u9ad4\u9577: 8 cm\npH\uff1a6.5 - 7.5\uff0cGdH\uff1a12\u3002\n\u6e29\u5ea6\uff1a21 -- 24C\n\u7522\u5730 : \u5317\u7f8e\u6d32~\u55ac\u6cbb\u4e9e\u5dde\u897f\u5317\u90e8\uff0c\u963f\u62c9\u5df4\u99ac\u5dde\u8207\u7f8e\u570b\u7530\u7d0d\u897f\u5dde\u6771\u5357\u65b9\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u85a9(Coosa)\uff0c\u5361\u54c8\u5df4(Cahaba)\uff0c\u963f\u62c9\u5df4\u99ac\u5dde\u8207\u6700\u4e0a\u6e38\u7684\u9ed1\u6b66\u58eb\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df(\u5168\u6469\u6bd4\u7063\u6d41\u57df)\u3002\n\u7279\u6027: \u91ce\u5916\u68f2\u606f\u65bc\u591a\u788e\u77f3\u7684\u6025\u6d41\u8207\u5c0f\u6eaa\u6d41(\u5c40\u90e8\u70ba\u6c99\u8cea\u5e95\u5c64)\u6c34\u6c60\uff1b\u4e5f\u5728\u5c0f\u6c34\u6cc9\u6216\u6e05\u6f88\u7684\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e2d\u767c\u73fe", "title": "\u5e7b\u5f69\u9713\u8679    \u82f1\u6587\u540d\uff1aRainbow shiner \u5b78\u540d\uff1aNotropis chrosomus", "publishedDate": "2012-12-31T13:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IAsyXXVhnw", "description": "Chinese Pistachio Trees in Autumn\n\nTook this pretty autumn footage, today, of Chinese Pistachio trees growing in a village in the Lachlan Valley, NSW, Australia.

Kutil bisa begitu datar sehingga tidak terlihat dengan mata telanjang, tetapi dapat menyebabkan nyeri dan gatal. Mereka dapat muncul secara sendiri-sendiri atau berkelompok. Pada pria, kutil kelamin biasanya muncul di penis atau di bawah kulup. Kutil kelamin juga dapat muncul di dalam uretra, biasanya hanya pada meatus uretra (pembukaan uretra di kepala penis). Pada wanita, kutil kelamin terlihat pada vagina, labia atau uretra.

It happened on our land and we could not standby and watch her die.\n\n'We didn't want Sirga to become like other lions in captivity, constantly fed by streams of tourists. She only interacts with me and Valentin.\n\n'She hunts her own food, taking antelopes and she will let us be near her when she eats it which is remarkable.\n\n'Sirga doesn't mind people, but she doesn't pay them any attention. Wild lions are scared of people, the problem comes if you release a lion that is used to people in the wild, that can cause problems.\n\n'With Sirga we want to release her to the wild eventually as a wild lion not as one that has met lots of people. That would be dangerous.'\n\nThe Modisa Wildlife Project aims at removing lions from areas where they face certain death after coming into conflict with farmers.\n\nMr Legarth added: 'If you release wild lions somewhere else, they will come straight back to where they were before because there is food there.\n\n'And if you just dump a pride of lions in the middle of a new territory they will disturb the prides that are already there.\n\n'In Botswana all lions are protected by the government - like swans being the property of the Crown in the UK. This also makes moving them a problem.\n\n'What we have now are 10,000-hectare plots with 10 to 15 lions in fenced enclosure, they are wild lions but we do have to feed them.\n\n'The first time you walk up to a lion all your body is telling you this is not something you should be doing.'\n\nBlog : http://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com/\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews", "title": "Amazing abandoned big Lion and her heartwarming bond with men who saved her", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T16:16:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ie3wWx7-Yc", "description": "http://hans-kleines-heavy-metal-eck.jimdo.com/heavy-metal-ostfriesland/necrobiosis/", "title": "Necrobiosis Memories Of The Past Drowning In Melancholy", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T18:46:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IeJM7LjVHU", "description": "The official video of the Planain single.", "title": "MYRO PLANTAIN", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T00:31:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IeR3ld0KHE", "description": "Dr. Joe talks about the impact of Nitric Oxide on health.", "title": "Nitric Oxide prevents high blood pressure that saves your heart, brain and kidneys", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T22:48:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IeX4yb7rCg", "description": "HARPIA - \"harpy eagle\" eagle\nNome cient\u00edfico: Harpia harpyja. \nNome em ingl\u00eas: Harpy Eagle. \nOrdem: Falconiformes. \nFam\u00edlia: Accipitridae. \nHabitat: Ocupa a mata prim\u00e1ria alta, em beira de rios e proximidade de barreiros. \nDistribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica: Ocorre do M\u00e9xico \u00e0 Bol\u00edvia e Argentina, e em grande parte do Brasil, mais encontrada na Amaz\u00f4nia.\nTempo de Incuba\u00e7\u00e3o: 52 dias. \nN\u00famero de ovos: 01. \nAlimenta\u00e7\u00e3o: pequenos e m\u00e9dios mam\u00edferos. \nCuriosidades: \u00c9 o mais possante rapineiro do mundo, apesar de n\u00e3o ser o maior.

Because of its high mechanical strength, good heat resistance, flame retardant, low toxicity, low smoke and its property of getting blended with other polymers to achieve high performance it is widely used in molding compounds, wood adhesives, laminates, insulation, and other fields. Phenolic resins are used in plywood and in fibrous and granulated wood products. Demand for wood products is influenced by the health of the construction industry and overall state of the economy. Since the major portion of phenolic resins is used in the wood products industry, the market for phenolic resins in most countries closely tracks GDP growth and housing market growth.\nWood adhesives will continue to have the largest share of the world market for phenolic resins and will drive phenolic resin consumption on a global scale. The developing regions of Central and South America and Central and Eastern Europe will experience the largest growth in this application. Phenolic resin consumption for molding compounds will grow primarily in China, India and other Asian countries as more molding operations start up in the region.\nThe report analyzes the global phenolic resins market trends and forecasts till 2019.

How do you do that? What are the steps? \n\nFirst, you need to ask yourself, \"Do I want to have a business of my own?\" Because it's a lot of work. Not only  will you be a designer, but you'll also be the bill collector, you'll be the marketing person, you'll sometimes have to be the project manager, the developer. You might have to learn other skills that you weren't necessarily ready to do. \n\nI think the good question to ask yourself is, \"Is this something that I really want to do? Do I have the means to do it and can I do it?\" All of those, of course, the last one is yes. You can do it. But it's really about getting the right knowledge beforehand before making such a hasty decision. \n\nThe first thing I would do is, there was this wonderful book that I read called \"How to Be a Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Soul\". And this book really breaks down a lot of different things about setting up, how to find a job, being a freelancer, setting up your own studio, running the studio, winning work, and the creative process, clients, and self-promotion. Like it really goes all around to basically tell you this is what to expect if you're running your own company and if you're running other people. \n\nAnother book is called, \"Design is a Job\". This is a beautiful book, too, that also basically points to the fact that a lot of designers are taken advantage of sometimes because it's just pretty design at the end of the day. But, when in reality, as a job, is business and you have to make sure that you have not only your tax paperwork ready which you can find out everything on startupnation.com or also on freelanceswitch.com. You also have to decide your rate, you have to decide what type of corporation you're going to be, if a corporation at all. Are you're going to be just a contractor. \n\nSo you're learning basically Business 101 before you even start designing and trying to set up those systems in place so that everything can be done in a productive and organized way. From billing your clients to emailing your clients to having a consistent brand to having consistent, even email template and business cards. \n\nSo the decision to be a business is a big one. So do your homework.", "title": "How to Set Up a Business | Graphic Design", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T15:37:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7IvivHAjG50", "description": "A New Bright Star - A Place for Amazing Innovative Art: China\n\nThis is not London or New York - this is modern art in Beijing.

Carob is a naturally sweet bean-like pod that grows alongside small flowers on carob trees. Originally used as feed for livestock by the Greeks, its use and consumption expanded in all over the world. Its current use is more versatile, as it is typically processed into a cocoa-type flour that is used to flavor sweets.\nBy simply heating the carob fruit and passing it through fine filters, the process makes a clear sweet syrup, with a low glycemic index, which, gram per gram, has much more less calories than sugar, so great for anyone who wants to control their sugar intake, even diabetic's.\n \nAs more people search for alternatives to sugar, our natural carob syrup is the perfect choice for all and an ideal replace for sugar in cooking, baking, as a topping for cereals, on hot and cold desserts or in tea and coffee.\n \nExcept carob syrup is one of the best healthy sugar replacements, has more and very important benefits:\nIt contains 3 times more calcium than milk\nis rich in iron and phosphorus\nis very helpful in cases of osteoporosis and bowel malfunction.\n \nCarob syrup is a healthy replacement for sugar that can be used as a natural sweetener in your tea, yogurt, in cakes, ice cream as a syrup, etc.\n\nBecause carob syrup is high in calcium and rich in phosphor, is ideal for:\nosteoporosis\npregnancy\nhair loss\nand during childrens growing up\n \n \nHow Carob syrup helps you in weight loss\nCarob syrup also is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, those fibers adsorb much water in the intestine and increase mobility, meaning that is perfect for:\n \nbad digestion\nconstipation.\n \nBecause it's rich combounds, carob may increase fat oxidation and energy expenditure in our body. In other words, carob may help to burn calories from our every day life and fat from the body. It also has beneficial effects on postprandial lipid metabolism related to hormones in the stomach; this means that it helps to increase the metabolism by positively affecting the secretion of hormones in the stomach.\n \nHow to use carob syrup: 1 tablespoon daily is enough to fullfill your needs. You can just eat one tablespoon of carob syrup or you can add it in your coffee, tea, salads, ice cream or yogurt as a natural sweetener in order to use it daily. No alergies or sideeffects are known but if you have any health problems related to food alergies it would be better to ask your doctor before the use of any food suplement even it is 100% natural as carob syrup.\n \n*General facts for carobs\nCarob usually used as a substitute of the chocolate, but carob has its own unique flavor and is very nice for drinks, bars with nuts , bread products , even mixed with baked beans and barbecue sauces. Carobs are very different nutrients and chemicals from chocolate, in a degree that people who are allergic to chocolate can enjoy sweets carob. Carob products are an incredibly rich source of food, and are perhaps the perfect \"food for survival\" since it lasts for a long time, does not require special storage conditions and can be eaten without preparation.\n\n \n\nBuy Carob Syrup\ncarob syrup benefits\nbuy carob\ncarob benefits\ncarob\n\n\nSource: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J0ZZMnnhDg", "title": "Buy Carob Syrup | Carob Health Benefits", "publishedDate": "2014-02-20T15:56:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "7J17Vb67vEY", "description": "Following in the footsteps of this year's legendary collaboration between hip hop act Run DMC and superstar DJ A-Trak, adidas Originals has brought together six unique Australian and New Zealand artists to produce three exclusive tracks.

No word of the party has been received in nearly two months.\nThe group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom.\nThe expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures.\nCarlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi.\n-New York Evening Post - Oct 15, 1919\n\nERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA\n\nMOMBASA (Reuters) - In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life.\nSeveral Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest.\nMiss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition.\nDetailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow.\nHer companion, Mrs. Victoria Post indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyle's purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship.\n-New York Evening Post March 11, 1920\n\nCARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle Expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives.\nRoger Carlyle, New York's rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing.\nAuthorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites.\nErica Carlyle, Roger Carlyle's sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the Site.\nAmong other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead.\n-New York Evening Post - May 24, 1920\n\nMURDERERS HANGED\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial.\nTo the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment.\nMiss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice.\n-New York Evening Post - June 19, 1920\n\nHope you find this useful :)", "title": "Carlyle Expedition News 2", "publishedDate": "2011-07-10T08:30:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7J9RurulVpE", "description": "Meaning of Implied Volatility, How to use IV, How Implied Volatility can make profits in Options strategies.
