It's not just an annoyance\u2014it's a hazard.\n\n\nWarning\nWorking with electricity is very dangerous \u2014 be extremely careful and, if you have any doubts, contact a professional.\n\nStep 1: Cut the power\nCut the power to the outlet by flipping the circuit breaker or removing the fuse at the main panel.\n\nTip\nIf you have a voltage detector, test that the power is off by inserting the tip of it into the outlet\u2019s smaller slot. Or just plug in an electrical fixture that you know is in working condition and test it.\n\nStep 2: Remove outlet cover\nWhen you\u2019re certain the power is off, unscrew and remove the outlet cover.\n\nStep 3: Remove the outlet\nUnscrew and remove the outlet itself from the electrical box. Notice how the wires are connected to it, either by two screws on the sides of the outlet, or fastened to the back.\n\nTip\nTake a digital picture of the back of the outlet so you\u2019ll have a reference of what wire attaches where.\n\nStep 4: Detach wires\nDetach the wires. If they are attached on the side by screws, loosen the screws with the screwdriver. If they\u2019re inserted in holes in the back, place the screwdriver in the slot located next to each hole to release the wire.\n\nStep 5: Get a new outlet\nTake your old outlet to the hardware store and purchase a new one just like the old one.\n\nStep 6: Reconnect wires\nInstall the new outlet by connecting the green or bare copper ground wire first. Bend the tip of the wire into a loop with the wire cutter and curl it around the screw in a clockwise direction. Use the screwdriver to tighten the screw into place.\n\nTip\nYou\u2019ll need about half an inch of bare wire to wrap around the screw; if you don\u2019t have enough, use the wire cutters to remove excess insulation.\n\nStep 7: Connect wires\nConnect the white wire, followed by the rest of the wires.\n\nStep 8: Replace the outlet\nReplace the outlet in the electrical box, making sure the green or bare copper grounding wire is not touching the other wires.\n\nStep 9: Replace the cover\nReplace the outlet cover.\n\nStep 10: Restore power\nTurn the power back on. You can use a voltage detector to check the outlet for power, or test it with an appliance. Congratulate yourself for a job well done.\n\nDid You Know?\nElectricity travels at the speed of light \u2014 more than 186,000 miles per second!", "title": "How to Replace an Electrical Outlet", "publishedDate": "2009-09-30T18:49:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "84aHeh_TxSE", "description": "House Tully of Riverrun is one of the Great Houses of Seven Kingdoms.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nUdayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are partly natural and partly artificial caves of archaeological, historical and religious importance near the city of Bhubaneswar in Odisha, India. The caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri, mentioned as Kumari Parvat in the Hathigumpha inscription. They have a number of finely and ornately carved caves. It is believed that most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain monks during the reign of King Kharavela. Udayagiri means \"Sunrise Hill\" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves.\n\nThe caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, called lena or le\u1e47a in the inscriptions, were dug out mostly during the reign of Kharavela for the abode of Jaina ascetics. The most important of this group is Ranigumpha in Udayagiri which is a double storeyed monastery.\n\nThe number of existing caves at Udayagiri is 18, while Khandagiri has 15. The local names of the existing caves are listed below, numbered according to the enumeration of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In what Judith Crist of Saturday Review called \"a magical blend of sight and sound that transcends the screen,\" Rasky drinks in the lush colors and mystic images of Chagall's paintings, tapestries, murals, mosaics, and stained glass windows from the Paris Opera to the Jerusalem Museum.\n\nHomage to Chagall is a documentary film of a magnitude (it features over 100 of the artist's paintings) that rivals the work of its subject. Rather than trapping Chagall's achievements in an amber of dry historical context and typical documentary didacticism, Rasky's casual mastery of film-making irresistibly humanizes and personalizes the art of Marc Chagall while only increasing its lingering, transcendent beauty.\n\nFor more information on this DVD or to purchase please visit:\nhttp://www.kultur.com/Homage-to-Chagall-p/d4622.htm", "title": "Homage to Chagall", "publishedDate": "2011-06-14T14:11:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "84quLlGds8I", "description": "For more latest and breaking news headlines...\nSUBSCRIBE: - https://www.youtube.com/user/BBCWorldNews111\nAIRLINES  ban FLIGHTS  to ISRAEL  after ROCKET STRIKE    BREAKING NEWS 2014\nTAGS\nAirlines ban flights to Israel after rocket strike\nA Hamas rocket exploded Tuesday near Israel's main airport, prompting a ban on all flights from the U.S. and many from Europe and Canada as aviation authorities responded to the shock of seeing a civilian jetliner shot down over Ukraine.\nIsrael declared that Ben-Gurion Airport was safe and said there was no reason to \"hand terror a prize\" by halting flights.\nThe rare flight ban came as Israel grappled with news that a soldier went missing after an attack in the Gaza Strip, raising the possibility he was abducted, a scenario that could complicate intense diplomatic efforts to end the two-week conflict.\nPalestinian militants have fired more than 2,000 rockets toward Israel since fighting began on July 8, but most \u2014 including several heading toward Tel Aviv \u2014 fell harmlessly into open areas or were shot out of the sky by the \"Iron Dome\" defense system, keeping Israeli casualties low.\nTuesday's rocket attack was the closest to the airport so far, said police spokeswoman Luba Samri, and largely destroyed a house, slightly injuring one Israeli in the nearby Tel Aviv suburb of Yehud.\nAviation authorities reacted swiftly. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited American airlines from flying to Tel Aviv for 24 hours \"due to the potentially hazardous situation created by the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza.\" Later, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory to airlines saying it \"strongly recommends\" airlines avoid the airport.\nGermany's Lufthansa, Air France, Air Canada, Alitalia, Dutch KLM, Britain's easyJet, Turkish Airlines and Greece's Aegean Airlines were among those carriers canceling flights to Tel Aviv over safety concerns amid the increasing violence.\n\n\n\n\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines .\n\n\nJOIN QUIZGROUP PARTNER PROGRAM: http://join.quizgroup.com/ .", "title": "AIRLINES  ban FLIGHTS  to ISRAEL  after ROCKET STRIKE    BREAKING NEWS 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T23:13:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "84qwkEvgJ3I", "description": "", "title": "Gregor Gysi macht Angela Merkel im deutschen Bundestag fertig", "publishedDate": "2010-11-08T20:03:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "84rDP2hhjHE", "description": "", "title": "Meconopsis TV   Accueil", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T21:06:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "84rImCUKU4Y", "description": "", "title": "TERATOMA", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T06:07:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "84rJTWGnYNE", "description": "http://www.waterhealstheworld.com/compare_ionizers.htm\nhttp://www.waterhealstheworld.com/Eczema-Skin-Disorders-Alkaline-Water.html\n\nVital facts about the appliance\n\nIf the sources are to be believed it is said that alkaline water provides a number of health benefits.

This large two-handed broad sword, (from the Gaelic Claideah-more=great sword), was considered a rough tool, although effective, as the users. It was King Jacob I's effective use of the Claymore sword that made it one of the symbols of national scottish pride. The Claymore sword, feared because of its size and strength, was used in the constant clan wars as well as against the English as late as the Rebellion of 1745.\n\nJacob I (1394-1437), King of Scotland, was crowned in 1424 in Scone. After overwhelming the Albany clan because of the conspirations againt him when he was a child, he decreased the power of the feudal lords. Under his rule, the Scotish laws were codified and a system of weights and measures was instituted. Assassinated by Sir Robert Graham in a conspiracy, he was brave in battle and had a \"strong hand\" in ruling his country. He was called the \"Lion of Scotland\".\n\nThis beautiful Miniature Damascene Claymore Sword Letter Opener is manufactured in Toledo Spain by the famous Midas factory of the Marto swordsmiths.

Additional parts were designed in CAD software, and fabricated in ABSplus material using a 3D printer. A 48V DC motor, powered by a servo-amplifier in current mode, imparts the actuating forces to the cart through a cable drive transmission. The position of the cart along the track is calculated from the angular position of the motor's output shaft, which is measured using an optical encoder. A second optical encoder, mounted on the cart, is used to measure the angle of the pole. \nThe pole balancing controllers were designed using LQR techniques, and run in real time under WinCon in Simulink.\n\n\n2013 Final year project by Mouratis Kiriakos\n\nProject supervisor: Dr. M.

This would literally take you years to go through all these websites just to find the particular movie you're looking for. I've been down that road of bookmarking a bunch of movie sites and latter find out that the site is no longer available, or that the website got shut down for whatever reason.\n\nThe site listed in this video has all the movies you could ever want, with a database of over 10,000 movies there is no way you wouldn't find the movie you were looking for. All the movies are of Blue-Ray quality so the movie will play back great no matter what mobile device you're using. Another great feature about this website is its search capabilities. With such a large database of movies one would expect that it would take a long time before you could actually find the movie you want but they have a streamline system which makes this process much faster and much more efferent than any other site.\n\nAs opposed to any other movie site on the net, they have all the latest release much earlier before any other sites get them. The reason I like this so much was due to the fact that in the past, I would latterly have to bookmark several different sites for each purpose and after a while thing started to get cluttered. What I'm trying to say is each site had its strong points and it's weak points which made the process that much more complicated because if you wanted to watch a new movie release you would have to go to this Site A and if you wanted to find mobile compatible movies then you would have to go to Site B.\n\nThis leads me to my next point, this site is one of the only few sites which allowed me to watch good  movies from my mobile device. A lot of sites claim to do this but they don't do it well enough so in the long run you end up wasting a lot of time trying to figure out ways to make it work. When you are pressed for time there is no way you could spend all day messing around with your phone trying to figure out why the site doesn't load. You came to watch movies, not put together a jig saw puzzle.\n\nWith the site listed above you won't have any of these problems, I took the time myself to check it out. Everything on this site works, all the movies works, all the links work and you can even download some of the movies directly to your mobile device if you don't feel like watching it now. This site latterly has everything you could want in a movie site without the hassle. If you don't believe me just go check it out for yourself and see.\n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention was that they also have servers all over the world which makes the access times very quick. A lot of the movie sites that I've been to in the past had one major issue in common and that was the location of the server which made the access times to the movies much longer.", "title": "Good Movies", "publishedDate": "2013-09-13T17:06:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "85EUOLWqsXg", "description": "Tracks- 01 - Intro + 02 - Troops of Desolation ... from the  EP\n\nBand: Vomit of Doom\nSpeed Black Metal Forces!!!!!", "title": "Troops of Desolation - Vomit of Doom", "publishedDate": "2011-11-11T19:02:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "85EbUUBKo3w", "description": "Funeral For A Friend - She Drove Me To Daytime Television", "title": "Funeral For A Friend - She Drove Me To Daytime Television", "publishedDate": "2007-04-05T12:28:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "85End5flPtI", "description": "MS ATOK,MS SABLAN,MS KABAYAN,MS MANGKAYAN,MS BAKUN,MS TUBA,MS BOKOD,MS ITOGON,MS BUGUIAS,MS TUBLAY,MS LA TRINIDAD,MS KAPANGAN,MS KIBUNGAN", "title": "cowgirl attire", "publishedDate": "2011-11-30T07:38:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "85F38q0K2xo", "description": "Sur le Fil du Sacr\u00e9 nous emm\u00e8ne en ballade d'une tradition religieuse \u00e0 lautre, tissant des ponts entre elles.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/TEN-Printed/149227725146153\nhttp://www.collectifartdealer.com/#!page-9", "title": "Trio Ten Printed: \"Durvun Oirdiin Uria\" Solo Morin Khuur", "publishedDate": "2013-05-08T13:48:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "85FCvu6O6js", "description": "Kinsley's Citrus Lane box came in for the month of January and I love it!

So the only really true way to know if you have gonorrhea weather you're male or female is to get tested for it, and the way to get tested for it is through a urine or a swab test. If there are going to be symptoms usually they tend to be more symptomatic in women than in men and it might be a discharge that you see, it may be a burning when someone urinates, it might be a discomfort during penetration, and it might also be a itching or burning sensation. Those are the things that you would look for. One important thing to note is that although gonorrhea is completely curable with antibiotics, if left undiagnosed and or untreated it can lead to infertility in both men and women. And finally, Gonorrhea is very infectious so if your partner has it and you don't use some sort of barrier method when your sexually active, so a condom or a dental damn or a female condom, you're likely to get it from your partner. So if your partner gets diagnosed with gonorrhea you should definitely be tested for it to make sure that you don't have it, and if you do have it that you both get treated at the time as it is completely curable.", "title": "Symptoms of Gonorrhea in Men vs. Women | STDs", "publishedDate": "2011-12-31T22:37:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "85OReOQNXGA", "description": "Cinema 4d intro that is AWESOME. i made it in 2hours with Cinema 4D and Sony Vegas OMGosh COOL BRA\nattracter", "title": "Epic Cinema 4D Attractor Intro  - Fnepf", "publishedDate": "2011-02-05T20:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "85OpCRtG0hA", "description": "Truant entertainment is a group of energetic students based on the campus of the university of technology here are some of our more candid moments", "title": "Truancy in action", "publishedDate": "2013-02-27T15:23:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "85P6cB_WGK4", "description": "tailskid leftmost semiology jotted puffily armure redfish beneficial buttes allegri dashingly disseized", "title": "allegri dashingly disseized", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T11:09:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "85PPYVlZe7I", "description": "Kisshergoodbye's BRAND NEW SONG!!!!!!!!\n\n@ the Coup\nClarksville, TN", "title": "Settle In Maturity KHG NEW SONG!", "publishedDate": "2009-05-17T21:56:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "85PUfhcXAns", "description": "\"Yo ser\u00e9 tu pueblo y tu ser\u00e1s mi Dios\"", "title": "Hermana Glenda - Tu eres el agua viva.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-03-14T17:46:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "85Q7oBIjf1M", "description": "Video of Ashley being given ear medicine.

There appears to be a hormonal component to its presentation. It is rarely seen in males, but is more common in males with androgen-deficient states, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, hypogonadism, postcastration states and in those patients receiving estrogen therapy for prostate cancer. The cellulite becomes more severe as the androgen deficiency worsens in these males.\n\narticle credits: Wikipedia", "title": "LIES About Cellulite Products- Why they're sucking you dry...", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T09:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "85QcRyKr4Xo", "description": "http://www.digitalmag.net/Video-detail/toshiba-satellite-c55-is-a-machine-worth-looking-into/\n\n\nT\n\noshiba Satellite C55-A-127 targets a pretty wide market segment as this machine incorporates the two characteristics that seldom go hand in hand... these are good performance and low price.

The refurbished golden strip-hardwood floor absorbs the halogen track light.  The current tenants renovated the space with style: improving the flow, lighting, wiring and walls, from the staff kitchen to the third floor studio.  Natural light escorts you from one floor to the next, to the next.  The second floor boasts four large rooms all of which have their own personality and are serviced by an open, updated washroom.  One office has a Juliette balcony another features a second full size bay window.  The third floor also has it's own washroom and makes a fine creative studio space.\n\nThe block, east of Greenwood Ave. is close to the Beach, Little India, South Riverdale, highways, bike routes and major avenues.

Daytime sees a steady traffic of families and east-enders commuting and shopping locally; the evening brings scores of 'outsiders' (905 and west enders) for culinary delights.\n\nClose to unique parks, light industry and major retail centres, the area continues to grow and evolve - given the potential of undeveloped properties along Eastern Avenue to the south.

Today I'm at Natchez Trace Greenhouses where they are growing some of the most striking Rex Begonias, which are perfect for holiday decorations.  Rex Begonias are primarily indoor plants known for their colorful and textured foliage. The coarse textured leaves are certainly colorful, with streaks and splashes of silver to cream to burgundy. There is a symmetry to the spiral shape of the leaves which adds to their beauty.  Rex Silver Blush has an almost metallic sheen with its silvery edges and bright pink middles.  The variety Redington has red tinged green leaves on top with rusty brown bottoms.  Rex Iron Cross has medium green leaves with a pebbled and quilted surface. The middle of the leaf features chocolate brown highlights on the center veins.  A most unusual selection is Rex Escargot. The foliage has a curling snail-like pattern starting at the base of the leaf.  Propagation of Rex Begonia is as interesting as their varied colors. Whole leaves are cut and placed in growing media and new plantlets form at the base of the leaf.  Direct sunlight can damage your Rex Begonia, so always place in indirect light for the best growth and performance.

And that is exactly what they did. They paid for a new fire station in Mr. Hill's home town, set up a scholarship fund for their local high school, and gave $50, 000 to buy land for a new municipal septic tank.\n\nWe'd all like to think we'd be this generous with our earnings but the reality is, most people fall into the next category.\n\nNumber 2: Personal Pleasure\nMany lottery winners have a rags-to-riches stories,  so maybe it's not surprising that some choose to keep the money for themselves.\n\nTake Adam Young and Tracy Tyler for example. The couple, who had two young children, were struggling to pay rent when they won almost \u00a36 million late last month. The British couple is planning to move out of their three-bedroom rented apartment and buy a five bedroom mansion, a new rover and take a safari in Kenya. \n\nNow, The National Endowment for Financial Education estimates that about 70% of people with a sudden wealth gain lose that money after a few years.  This could explain the next category.\n\nNumber 3: Lottery Winners Who end up Poor\nAt just 16 years old Callie Rogers was the youngest Brit to ever win the lottery. At the time, she was living in a foster home and working for \u00a33.60 an hour when she won almost 2 million pounds in the UK lottery. After spending excessively on drugs, parties, vacations and plastic surgery, Rogers frittered away almost all her money. Now ten years later, she has about \u00a32,000 pounds in the bank and is training to be a nurse. She says the money almost ruined her and she tried to commit suicide three times before she finally got her life back on track.\n\nNumber 4: Law Suits\nJack Whittaker experienced a number of tragedies after winning $350 million in a 2002 US multistate-jackpot. Already pretty well off from his work at a construction company, he blamed the new money for the series of tragedies that followed his win. He not only lost his daughter, and his granddaughter to drugs but his attorney estimates that he spent about  $3million dollars fending off lawsuits. As of 2007 he said he had had 400 lawsuits filed against his, and in his words, it was because \"everybody wants something for nothing.\"\n\nNumber 5: MURDERED \nSadly there have been a few cases where winning the lottery has meant loss of life. \n\n46-year-old Urooj Khan from Chicago was poisoned in 2012 with cyanide within hours of accepting his lottery check of about half a million dollars. His death has been classified as a homicide but no arrests or convictions have been made.\n\nSimilarly, 47-year old Abraham Shakespeare from Florida was murdered after winning $30 million in a state lottery. Dee Dee More was convicted of his murder, after his body was found on her boyfriend's property.\n\nSo, while this month's US jackpot hits $425 million was split by three winners, it will be interesting to see what they do with all that cash.\n\nWell, what do you think? Have you ever won any money in the lottery? How did you spend it? How do you imagine your life would be different if you became a multi-millionaire all of a sudden.

I think it's a Christmas Miracle! :::: Lyrics below ::::\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMerry Christmas \nAnd ah happy new year\nEverything I say is from the top with no fear\nI be on my grind and when im looking at my peers\nI see them looking at me but they never wanna back me.\nThat's ok im like the goose that bake bread,\nWhen it's time to eat, enough said \nI got a watch that don't work\nMy girl needs a new skirt\nAnd this dude looking at me like he want hurt\nI don't even mean be jerk\nBut I'm out work\nMy patience thinner than a silk shirt\nPlus my girl is gone, so im alone on Christmas eve\nI need Christ to keep the dirt from coming out my sleeve \n\nThey say the more you sip the more you slip\nBut if you limp when you walk, and pimp when you talk\nWhatcha supposed to do after dark?\nI guess that's why they locked the clubs to the thugs\nAnd told us to come back without the drugs\nBut the drugs were full of colors\nAnd with the colored wearing colors\nThe only colors left, were the lights lit\nIlluminate the white wit\nAnd witness the white fur from a ferret\nPeradventure bite me no denture \nI catch her\nLike the rye\nWho am I? Who am I?\nI black man in the night sky \nYou cant see you or I, or who I eye\nBecause my eye black but never blue\nFrom a beating or European seeking \n\nBy Clinton Washington", "title": "SPACE FUNK CHRISTMAS EVE FLOW by Clinton Washington / produced by Multipoly", "publishedDate": "2012-12-25T07:44:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "86Mmawy4Akg", "description": "\u039a\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2: \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf)", "title": "\u039a\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03c3\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2: \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf) - Kladema kerasias", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T17:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "86MrNROyklU", "description": "", "title": "Midpoint 6k", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T16:54:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "86NtXtC8Zbw", "description": "If you want the most delicious accompaniment to nearly ANY dish, look no further than this bright, vibrant and flavour packed tomato salad.

The end of the video shows a more typical form of the behaviour where severe pecks are directed towards back feathers in the region of the preen gland.\n\nSevere (SFP) is the most problematic type of feather pecking in terms of damage to the recipient. It consists of forceful pecks and pulls of feathers that are frequently eaten and results in feather loss on the back, vent and tail area. Victims of SFP often initially show a behavioural response to receiving SFP, either by moving away or by confronting the pecker. If SFP continues, however, victims have also been observed to surrender to being pecked and remain still. \n\nSFP results in feather damage and feather loss which leads to bald patches and can be followed by pecking to the bare skin. If pecking to the skin continues, it can lead to wounds and can eventually lead to the victim's death due to excessive blood loss and tissue damage.\n\nHow to identify the behaviour:\n\nLook out for birds performing sharp forceful pecks and pulls directed at another birds feathers. Often targeted towards the back, vent and tail. Feathers are also frequently eaten.\n\nCauses of Severe feather pecking:\n\nThe general consensus is that the abnormal behaviour is a redirected foraging behaviour which can develop in the absence of suitable foraging material. However, SFP is affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to; diet, stress, fear and genetics.\n\nFor more information please visit: http://www.featherwel.org/injuriouspecking", "title": "Severe Feather Pecking", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T14:58:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "86XQBI1f6CA", "description": "Pierid butterfly found in Asia and parts of Australia.

So are some politicians. Even some famous athletes are fanatical. So it shouldn't surprise us that some Christians have to work hard at avoiding their tendency toward fanaticism.\nThink of it this way. Every Christian has opinions on many secondary areas of doctrine and practice. I am talking about things that are not essential for salvation. This is the level I call \"Convictions.\" Picture it being the center circle of several concentric circles. At this level, Christians differ from one another on a multitude of perspectives and practices. It doesn't change the fact that every believer, regardless of his other convictions, is saved by grace through faith in Christ alone. We are one in Christ through the blood that He shed to make us His own. We are family forever.\n\nThe next level out from \"Convictions\" is \"Tangents.\" A Christian moves to this level when he is constantly dwelling on his conviction about a secondary issue of doctrine or practice. He is no longer keeping the main thing the main thing. Rather than maintaining a balanced approach to Scripture and discipleship, he has gone off on a mental tangent and it has caused him to become restless in his heart and mind. His tangent has taken away his joy of walking with Jesus, as well as the joy of fellowship with others in the body of Christ.", "title": "Fanaticism is Not Christianity", "publishedDate": "2012-06-24T15:45:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "86bL7NN70h0", "description": "Maggie Frost, co - owner of Native Son Landscaping, describes her positive experience working with Captivation Media and the value our web design and social media management brought to the business.\n\nFor More Information Visit http://www.captivationmedia.com", "title": "Captivation Media Client Testimonial - Native Son Landscaping", "publishedDate": "2012-04-02T19:42:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "86bdBgM0Rfw", "description": "27th / 27\u00e8me SULTAN MARATHON DES SABLES.", "title": "27th / 27\u00e8me SULTAN MARATHON DES SABLES", "publishedDate": "2012-03-07T14:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "86bqq3DIP0w", "description": "Fragile..una delle tanti canzoni stupende di Tony Colombo...", "title": "tony colombo...Fragile...", "publishedDate": "2009-04-03T12:11:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "86buLyRqHtw", "description": "In 1966, when I was just a girl of nine, I fell in love with Davy Jones of The Monkees.

Adeev studies under the Dizzy Gillespie prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jon Faddis at SUNY Purchase, while Ezra received a full ride scholarship to Manhattan School of Music on Bass Trombone. The twins have performed around the country at notable venues such as Jazz at Lincoln Center and First Avenue, as well as festivals like South By Southwest (SXSW), and perform annually for Warren Buffet's Shareholders Meeting. Ezra and Adeev also delivered a TEDtalk, as a part of the popular online video series. The twins have also performed with piano virtuoso Jonathan Batiste. They have cultivated relationships with musicians like; Chris Botti, Gregory Porter, Terell Stafford, Stefon Harris, Joshua Redman, Don Vappie, Big Sam Williams, as well as the entire Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and many more. The twins hope to use their relationships to spread jazz to a wider audience.

Uranium is radioactive and decays into a series of other radioactive elements. Therefore, UF6 in storage emits low levels of radiation. The radiation levels measured on the outside surface of filled depleted UF6 storage cylinders are typically about 2 to 3 millirem per hour (mrem/h), decreasing to about 1 mrem/h at a distance of 1 ft (0.3 m).\nChemical Effects\n\nIn addition, if UF6 is released to the atmosphere, the uranium compounds and HF that are formed by reaction with moisture in the air can be chemically toxic. Uranium is a heavy metal that, in addition to being radioactive, can have toxic chemical effects (primarily on the kidneys) if it enters the bloodstream by means of ingestion or inhalation. HF is an extremely corrosive gas that can damage the lungs and cause death if inhaled at high enough concentrations.\n\nThe potential health risks associated with uranium compounds and HF are discussed in further detail in Chapter 4 of the PEIS.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_Uranium_Hexafluoride_Processing_Facility\n\nhttp://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/10/uranium-hexafluoride-release-tonight-at-honeywell-works-metropolis-il-3051664.html\n\nhttp://optimalprediction.com/wp/uranium-hexafluoride-releases-at-honeywell-metropolis-works-may-2012-part-1/", "title": "Nuclear Watch: USA Illinois Uranium Hexafluoride' Release at Honeywell Works 10/26/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T11:02:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "86sCA8lbnQ0", "description": "", "title": "Syndrome de beckwith wiedemann", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T13:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "86sllhIgnEc", "description": "Follow @SlateViral, Watch more: SlateV.com, Facebook.com/SlateVideo\n\nWhat appears to be an adult albino orca has been sighted off the eastern coast of Russia--perhaps the first sighting ever of its kind in the wild.

The name comes from the ancient Greek for \"river horse\" (\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and the heaviest extant artiodactyl. Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, their closest living relatives are cetaceans (whales, porpoises, etc.) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago. The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates around 60 million years ago. The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the genus Kenyapotamus in Africa, date to around 16 million years ago.\n\nHippos are recognizable by their barrel-shaped torsos, enormous mouths and teeth, nearly hairless bodies, stubby legs and great size, adults average 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) and 1,300 kg (2,900 lb) for males and females respectively. Despite its stocky shape and short legs it can easily outrun a human, being capable of reaching 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the most aggressive and unpredictable creatures in the world and, as such, ranks among the most dangerous animals in Africa. Nevertheless, they are still threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.\n\nThe hippopotamus is semiaquatic, inhabiting rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to 30 females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land.\n\n----------------\nVisit my blog: http://donaldsharev.blogspot.com\nVisit my channel: http://youtube.com/donaldsharev\nSUBSCRIBE: \n\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/donaldsharev\ntumblr: http://donaldsharev.tumblr.com/\n----\nThanks for watching!\nPost comment, share, like and tell me what you think!\n- Donald.\n\nhttp://www.ask.com/  http://vk.com/\nhttp://www.yandex.ru/  https://twitter.com/\nhttp://www.liveleak.com/  http://www.wykop.pl/\nhttp://www.bing.com/  https://www.tumblr.com/\nhttp://www.reddit.com/  http://www.google.com/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/  https://www.facebook.com/", "title": "Big hippo's eating hay in 4K", "publishedDate": "2014-09-24T14:03:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "86vtF8nalpM", "description": "", "title": "Escaleras Becquerel...", "publishedDate": "2010-06-29T00:47:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "86w5olK2T6U", "description": "\u265aIf you enjoyed the song hit the \"Like\" button, it helps me a lot by showing me your love/support\n\u265aDon't forget to share it with your friends\n\u265aSubscribe Here: https://youtube.com/officialtrapparty\n\u265aTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrapParty \n\u265aFacebook: https://facebook.com/officialtrapparty\n\u265aTo find the latest and the best!\n\nSupport JSTJR\nSoundCloud \u25bahttps://soundcloud.com/jstjr\nFacebook\u25bahttps://www.facebook.com/Jstjr\nTwitter\u25bahttps://twitter.com/jstjr603\n\nIf you guys are looking for a good music channel that uploads good Trap/Bass/Dubstep/Chill music then check my friends channel \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SpareMusic\n\nIf you like our new art/design/video effects go and check DataExe right here: http://www.youtube.com/user/DataExe\n\n\nFor more information contact us at officialtrapparty@gmail.com.\nSee Ya all Soon :)\nIf you dont like that i uploaded your song then message us on our Gmail and we will delete it ASAP.\n\nFor any business inquiries contact us on our Email: officialtrapparty@gmail.com", "title": "JSTJR - Valhalla", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T02:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "86wmHyijr2Y", "description": "Joe Torre discusses his number being retired.

The dealership ended up declining my loan because of my credit history. A few years ago, I was in over my head with credit cards. I maxed out all my credit cards and I couldn't pay for them. As you can imagine, my credit was in really bad shape. \n\nI was ignorant in thinking that I could get financed either way. I had friends that had worst credit than me, but they were able to get financing for a new car.  So, I went online and started to do research and I came across this website.\n\nI found a website that specializes in bad credit auto loans. This website was completely different than the lenders that the dealerships use. They end up only using a few local lenders and have special financing through the manufacturer. This website uses a network of lenders across the nation that specializes with individuals that have really bad credit.\n \nOf course, I was skeptical, but I tried it anyways. So, I filled out a really simple form and within minutes I got more than 4 lenders that would finance me immediately for a new car. \n\nI was so happy. I got to purchase the car I initially wanted. \n\nbad credit car loans\nbad credit auto loans", "title": "How I Got a Car Loan with Bad Credit", "publishedDate": "2013-02-03T14:18:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "86zygWn4bgM", "description": "Teledysk pod bit DJ Podpierdalacza zrealizowany w Bia\u0142ogardzie, sierpie\u0144 2009.\n\nJe\u015bli klip jest u Ciebie wy\u015bwietlany w niskiej rozdzielczo\u015bci to prawdopodobnie powiniene\u015b zainstalowa\u0107 Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae Player 10", "title": "G.A.B. - Szczere zwroty", "publishedDate": "2009-08-22T20:36:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "87-Q3bkQguQ", "description": "EL DETRACTOR ULTIMO TEMA EN EL DISCO 1 DEL DISCO DOBLEMENTE 4 DE ESCAPE LIBRE www.escapelibrerock.com EL PRIMER DISCO DOBLE DE LA BANDA Y EL CUARTO EN SUS 26 A\u00d1OS DE VIDA.

The dog, named Piggy, is five and a half years old and had received professional training. Piggy, who has participated in 12 rescue operations, arrived at the epicentre of Longtushan Town on Monday, along with the Red Cross mountain team. The dog's arrival has helped to speed up the team's relief work and find several buried villagers in the earthquake ruins, but the high intensity of the work has exhausted Piggy and swelled its paws. Piggy now has finished the search task in Ludian and will return to Sichuan with its team. The team will send Piggy to the vets to cure its paws and sense of smell. After treatment, they'll bring it home to rest for a good few weeks. Report by Claire Lomas.\n\nITN is becoming ODN.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Rather, it is a lifestyle including foods, activities, meals with friends and family, and wine in moderation with meals.

Most of the effect was seen in a reduction in strokes.\n\nMediterranean Food Cooking style\n \nThe way to prepare a Mediterranean food meal is fairly easy, as everything about the diet plan is kept simple and nice. Spices are being used a lot in preparing the dishes, for instance, mint, oregano, thyme, basil, etc etc.. As we know spices are being used a lot in eastern culture too, Olives are a staple of the Mediterranean diet and are reported to have a lot of benefits to how our body stays in an optimal condition.\n \nBasil is also a good source of vitamin A, which helps to prevent damage to the cells by free radicals. Vitamin A also prevents free radicals from oxidizing cholesterol in the blood stream, preventing the cholesterol from building up in the blood vessels.\n\nThyme's essential oils have expectorant and bronchial antispasmodic properties, making it useful in the treatment of acute and chronic bronchitis, sore throats, coughs, and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. laryngitis and asthma.\n \nWild oregano is found to have a diverse mineral content including calcium, iron, and potassium. It is also high in Vitamin C.

Not only is his latest release Googly continuing to do well at the box office in its sixth week, but he claims that the scripts of his films are also in great demand. The filmmaker, who has just directed the Telugu version of his debut directorial Govindaya Namaha, titled Potugaadu, the audio of which was launched recently, has sold the remake rights of Googly as well.\n\"The rights have been sold for Rs 45 lakh, which is the highest for a Kannada script,\" claims Pavan. But that news apart, the fact that the producer of Googly is splitting that amount with Pavan has him on cloud nine. \"Normally once the film is made, the script belongs to the producer, but in this case, there was a mutual understanding and we decided to split the money,\" says the filmmaker, who adds that the script of Govindaya Nahama has been picked up for a Hindi version.\nAs for the casting for the Telugu version of Googly, Pavan says that Nagachaitanya may not do the film, even though he saw the original and expressed interest to work in the remake, as he is tied up with other commitments and can allot dates only in early 2014. \"In a day or two we will have a final picture on the casting,\" he says.

So the oral posture for a general Russian accent is to pull your tongue all the way back in your throat. So you're pulling your tongue all the way back here. And a lot of the sounds take care of themselves when you pull your tongue all the way back where it needs to be. Let's take a look at some Russian sound changes. \n\nThe first thing I want to look at is that r sound. It's a really hard r when your tongue is pulled all way back in the back of your throat. Rachel runs errands for her mother and father on Saturdays. Rachel runs errands for her mother and father on Saturdays. Let's look at the ah to the eh. So in American English, I'd say I had a bad day. But in your Russian accent I had a bad day. I had a bad day. And listen to the friction in that h. Had. I had a bad day. Bad day.\n\nAgain, that th sound changes for your Russian accent. So thin, thick, this, and that becomes thin, thick, or this, that. Thin, thick, this, that. So again that th sound changes for your Russian accent. In American English it would be thin, thick, this, that. In Russian it would be thin, thick, this, that. Or it becomes completely dentalized, meaning your tongue is all the way up on your teeth. For thin, thick, this, that. That ih to e transition. So in American English it would be I loved my big trip. Ih, ih. In your Russian accent it would be I loved my big trip. I loved my big trip. E, e.\n\nAnd listen to that l sound when I say the word loved. Loved. Instead of loved, loved, where I'm using just the tip of my tongue. Loved, loved. I'm using my whole tongue, and bringing the back of my tongue almost to close off my throat. I loved my big trip. La, la, la. Give that a shot. And then also notice that vowel sound. Instead of loved, uh, that shwa sound that's very American. The American oral posture sound uh. It opens up and it becomes forward a little bit. For loved, loved.\n\nSo try this sentence. I got up and saw my files were corrupt. I got up and saw my files were corrupt. In American English it would be I got up and saw my files were corrupt. Uh, uh. But in your Russian accent it's got files corrupt.\n\nSo what do you hear in the musicality of the Russian accent? It's a little bit slower. It's a little bit heavier than your American accent. There's less pitch variety in your Russian accent. But don't take my word for it. Listen to native Russian speakers, and see what you hear for yourself.

Current levels in the atmosphere are at about 393 ppm (parts per million). Commercial green houses operate with CO2 at 900 ppm to 1400 ppm growing plants faster, more nutritious, and larger so that more people can be fed. If you're against CO2 you're against Green Life on Earth.\n\nGiven a new peer reviewed estimate of climate temperature rise from CO2, a 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C for a doubling of CO2, that means that if CO2 where to double from the current level of ~393 ppm, rounding to 400, to 800 ppm we'd have a 1.1 C increase... then double again to 1600 ppm and we'd have a 2.2 C increase. That is about the temperature range seen at least three times since the end of the last major Ice Age about 12,500 years ago. So what is the big deal?\n\n900 ppm to 1400 ppm is the typical range in commercial greenhouses that have plants grow faster, more nutritious, and larger (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87HL29fMtW8&hd=1). More plants equals more food for humans and other plant eating animals.\n\nIn fact rising CO2 is a net positive benefit for just about all life on the planet Earth .

Click \"See More\" for the transcript. \n\nTRANSCRIPT: Seeing geese heading south for the winter, notice their V-shaped formation. Scientists say that each bird's flapping creates uplift for the bird immediately behind. The entire flock gains at least 70% greater range than a bird flying alone.\nA goose that drops out of formation encounters drag and resistance. That prompts her quick return to the formation. As the lead goose tires, it rotates back and another takes the point. Geese behind honk to encourage those in front to maintain speed.\nThis is Howard Butt, Jr., of Laity Lodge, with this reminder from geese in flight: Working together and encouraging one another will take us further than our going it alone, in the high calling of our daily work.\nWhat then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.\n(1 Cor. 14:26)", "title": "V Formation", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T17:23:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "87L19U0Jcjs", "description": "***LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE***\n\nMechromancer #1: http://youtu.be/skunRxgDAZo\n\nConsidering the volume of Borderlands 2 stuff out there, I thought I would make a series of quick vids just showing how my character is being built. \n\nBorderlands 2 Gunzerker Build tutorial Tips and Tricks Commentary class tree Borderlands 2 Gunzerker Build tutorial Tips and Tricks Commentary class tree Borderlands 2 Gunzerker Build tutorial Tips and Tricks Commentary class tree", "title": "Borderlands 2 Gunzerker Build Episode 1 - LVL 14", "publishedDate": "2012-09-20T08:01:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "87L25ED9t90", "description": "PDF Manual: http://goo.gl/ZVeWNv\n\nPlaces you can purchase:\n  Hold Fast Foundry - http://goo.gl/toaYkB\n  MyFonts - http://goo.gl/CI8O1M\n  Creative Market - http://crtv.mk/tSgw\n  Font Bros - http://goo.gl/wp2kak", "title": "How to Layer the Industry Inc Typeface", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T11:42:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "87LAIaaTUyw", "description": "Are you aware that a sensitivity to a chemical in some foods can promote eczema and psoriasis?", "title": "Salicylic Acid Sensitivity", "publishedDate": "2014-02-07T20:30:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "87LC0PBC2kY", "description": "", "title": "\u0e41\u0e21\u0e25\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T10:58:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "87M0axtpL1c", "description": "Calan performing Swansea Hosepipe Set live at Acapela Studio. \nFrom Season 1 of the S4C television series 'Yn Fyw o Acapela'.\n\nwww.acapela.co.uk", "title": "Calan - Swansea Hosepipe Set (Live at Acapela Studio)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T16:26:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "87MVH7YHz2g", "description": "Lite exempel p\u00e5 hur Mona har fifflat och fuskat genom \u00e5ren, med skatt, p-b\u00f6ter, svartjobb, obetalda tv-licenser, osv osv. \n\nDet finns lite olika versioner p\u00e5 den h\u00e4r lilla klassikern, men jag s\u00e5g att originalet inte fanns kvar, s\u00e5 jag g\u00f6r min samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nst och \u00e5teruppladdar klippet.

It was set up in January 2013 in the yard of the National Research University of Information Technologies (ITMO University).\n\nThe owners of the monument have said they were motivated in removing the structure for two major reasons. The first referred to last week's announcement by Apple CEO Tim Cook that he was openly gay. ZEFS have reportedly stated that they were seeking to comply with a law that bans the promotion of \"nontraditional sexual relations among minors.\" The second reason was recent leaks by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden which indicated that Apple devices were used by US intelligence agencies to spy on people worldwide.\n\nThe monument, in the shape of a giant iPhone 4G, was equipped with an interactive touch screen that provided information about the founder of Apple. On the back side of the monument there was a QR-code, which forwarded to a website dedicated to Steve Jobs.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/Ruptly\nLiveLeak: http://www.liveleak.com/c/Ruptly\nGoogle Plus: http://google.com/+RuptlyTV\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/Ruptly\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/RuptlyTV\nDailyMotion: http://www.dailymotion.com/ruptly\nVideo on Demand: http://www.ruptly.tv", "title": "Russia: Steve Jobs iPhone monument dismantled in St. Petersburg", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T15:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "87Q5PEjmrCU", "description": "Pobierz nowy utw\u00f3r \"Flirt\", dost\u0119pny wy\u0142\u0105cznie w serwisie Muzodajnia.pl:\nhttp://www1.plus.pl/muzodajnia/main/track.html?artistId=433776&trackId=3861863&t=Sylwia+Grzeszczak%2BFlirt\n\nDolacz do Sylwii na Facebooku http://www.facebook.com/SylwiaGrzeszczakOfficial \nMusic video by Sylwia Grzeszczak performing Male Rzeczy.

Rh\u00e9al, the gentleman helping me is a great neighbor, has a well equipped shop and I met him as he was planning to build a conventional wood stove. I believe we were brought together on this project by design more than by chance, Anyways, he wanted a new wood stove, and I needed a place and equipment to build myself one too.. I extolled the virtues and benefits of Rocket Stove Heaters, their combustion efficiency and thriftiness on combustibles and he was skeptic when I told him he would no longer need to cut 7 cords of wood to heat his shop. Rheal is 80 years old and understandably, not a techie nor is he into YT or the Web but after I showed him some of the YouTube Stovie videos on my smartphone, he agreed to help me build my 1st RSH in his shop, in exchange for some materials,some cash and a little know-how (as this my first build). \n\nHats off to fellow stovies;\ntrying2lhard,\nkbbacon,\ncaotropheus\nJeff Crutchfield, \nqwertyscot, \napostolengineering, \nppotty1, \nPekka Leskala, \nMr. Teslonian,\n\nand all others committed to designing, recording and mostly posting their plans and build videos on YouTube to promote this technology and their respective skills, knowledge and experiences. Without all you fellas I wouldn't know where to begin.CHEERS, Y'ALL !!\n\nThis build includes;\n\n4\", .25\" thick square tubing riser, burn chamber, feed tube system. 6 inch galvanized stove pipe with perlite for insulation stuffed between it and outside of the riser tube. Burn chamber 20.5\" long, riser 21.5\" high.18'' long (at inside angle) 20 degree angled 4'' feed tube. An expanded steel grate will be inserted right to the back of the \"J\" in the burn chamber and bent upwards to allow air to flow under the feed tube. A 3.5'' wide, 13'' long, 1/16'' thick stainless plate will be inserted under the expanded steel grate to act as a heat reflector to help minimize heat transfer to bottom of burn chamber. Another thinner ss plate will be inserted between burn chamber and bottom 20'' x 20'' plate to further decrease heat transfer. A 3'' wide, 2 inch deep slot will be cut on the front end bottom of the burn chamber and a trying2lhard designed 3.5 inch section of pipe will be capped on one end then welded to cover air inlet slot with a screen to catch sparks/embers. A rotating cover on the open end of pipe will allow air inlet adjustments or dampening. . A trying2lhard designed front burn chamber glassed door will be added when test burns are completed. A basic, hinged, magnetically fastened thin metal plate for feed tube cover and temporary burn chamber air inlet choke. A small, 13.5'' dia. lube barrel will cover the riser tube assembly and be custom cut and sealed with stove cement where the  feed tube and burn chamber exit the barrel at the bottom, front part of the stove. A 20' 'x 20'' 1/8th'' thick base plate will be welded to the bottom of the burn chamber, then fastened to the bottom of barrel using 6 uniformly, radially distributed 90 degree tabs welded to the barrel with holes drilled through the bottom plate allowing nuts and bolts to fasten it together. High temp sealant will be added to make this joint leak-proof. The barrel will also be cut into 2 sections near the top part, to allow inspection and clean-out. This joint will be secured by a homemade aluminum band clamp and sealed with high temp sealant to make it leak-proof. I may have to weld a 1/8'' thick 13.5'' diameter plate to the top of my barrel in the future if it gets too hot, too quickly, to reduce risk of meltdown or burning my freaking trailer down with me inside of it!!   Four 10'' legs fabricated from angle iron and large flat washers for feet will be welded under the base plate recessed inwards about 2'' from the trimmed corners. A 4'' diameter hole will be cut near the bottom of the barrel for the exhaust. A 4'' aluminum elbow will be inserted through this hole & fastened by cutting and flaring 3/4'' tabs on the inside of the barrel, using high temp sealant or stove cement to make this joint leak-proof. A  24'' aluminum pipe section will then be clamped to the elbow, then a 4'' flexible dryer vent tubing will be clamped to that 24'' pipe and a 4'' hole will be cut through the RV wall near the roof line, with the flex tubing extending out the wall up & over the roof line into another 12'' of 4'' vent pipe with a ppotty1 designed swivel cowling assembly at the very top to prevent any downdraft. When I can find a suitable, lightweight material for a thermal mass I may include it into my design to conserve all possible exhaust heat.P.S. IF YOU BUILD ONE LIKE THIS ADD AN ASH CATCHER AND CLEAN OUT. I REGRET NOT DOING THAT. PUT IT UNDERNEATH MAKE IT AT LEAST 6' LONG...Thanks for watching ,commenting and subscribing.", "title": "DIY Rocket stove heater build, plans in description", "publishedDate": "2013-10-06T03:17:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "87QbxrCAU5U", "description": "Vladimir Kramnik beat Veselin Topalov in the Russia-Bulgaria match in round five of the Chess Olympiad in Troms\u00f8.

Remember, this should only be done if it's worth spending the \ntime and effort analyzing the risk; else, it's better to move from Qualitative Risk analysis to Risk Response planning, which is the next step in Risk \nmanagement.Usually, Quantitative Risk Analysis is done for highest risk on the project to further investigate them.So the updated list of Risk Register is the input to Quantitative Risk Analysis.The numerical quantitative risk data is usually collected by analyzing past project data or by expert judgment. Sometimes numerical data are also used for simulation and one of the simulation techniques is Monte Carlo Analysis.For example, using Monte Carlo Analysis you can check if the project is executed 100 times, what is the probability of completing the project on a specific \ndate. Similar analysis can be done for the risk as well.Numerical data also helps in using Decision tree concept to objectively analyze project risks and impact.But again let me emphasize that, quantitative risk analysis should only be done when it's worth doing it. Usually large multi year project may require quantitative risk analysis.The output of this process is the quantified list of prioritized risks. Along with this, some times the amount of contingency reserve in terms of time and \ncost is also calculated as part of this process.", "title": "Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis | Project Risk Management | PMP Exam Prep Online", "publishedDate": "2012-03-02T06:23:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "87U1RhPSs1w", "description": "", "title": "Paloma Ant\u00e1rtica (Chionis alba)", "publishedDate": "2011-10-22T10:53:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "87UVT_jhUPE", "description": "Orange gets a lesson from the hottest pepper alive: Jalape\u00f1o\n\nRETWEET: http://bit.ly/g8mN3M\n\nFREE version of my video game Kitchen Carnage:\niTunes: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnageFREE\nAndroid: http://bit.ly/KCLiteGoogle\n\nMERCH:\nAO TOYS! http://bit.ly/AOToys\nT-SHIRTS: http://bit.ly/AOMerch\niPHONE/iPOD GAME: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnage\niPAD GAME: http://bit.ly/KitchenCarnageHD\nANDROID GAME: http://bit.ly/qqDmRi\nMUSIC: http://bit.ly/AOMusic\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/annoyingorange\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/annoyingorange\nGOOGLE+: http://bit.ly/AOGooglePYouTube\nMY WEBSITE: http://annoyingorange.com\n\nWATCH MY EPISODES! http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=F7804CA8F551DF96\n\nCREATED BY: \nDANEBOE: http://youtube.com/daneboe\nDANEBOE GAMING CHANNEL: http://youtube.com/superboebros\nDANEBOE 2ND CHANNEL: http://youtube.com/user/gagfilms\n\nSTARRING:\nJAMES CAAN (Chairman of Openfilm.com) as JALAPENO \nhttp://youtube.com/openfilm\nhttp://openfilm.com\nSHIRA LAZAR as PEACH: http://youtube.com/partnersproject", "title": "Annoying Orange - Jalape\u00f1o", "publishedDate": "2010-12-17T15:44:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "87UbVqAu5tw", "description": "Boost your laptop sound to the level it deserves with the Altec Lansing Orbit USB.

One of the best-known porphyrins is heme, the pigment in red blood cells; heme is a cofactor of the protein hemoglobin. Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their \u03b1 carbon atoms via methine bridges (=CH\u2212). Porphyrins are aromatic. That is, they obey H\u00fcckel's rule for aromaticity, possessing 4n+2 \u03c0 electrons (n=4 for the shortest cyclic path) delocalized over the macrocycle. Thus porphyrin macrocycles are highly conjugated systems. As a consequence, they typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible region and may be deeply colored; the name \"porphyrin\" comes from a Greek word for purple. The macrocycle has 26 pi electrons in total. The parent porphyrin is porphine, and substituted porphines are called porphyrins. The specific porphyrin in heme B (see Figure) is called protoporphyrin IX and has 4 methyl, two vinyl, and two propionic acid substituents at the indicated positions.", "title": "synthesis of Heme porphyrin ring", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T19:06:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "87VAiOQ2k0Q", "description": "Quinto video de Pasaporte llamado: \"Detente\" el cual es soundtrack de la segunda serie de MTV: Popland\n\nDescarga gratis la musica de Pasaporte en:\nwww.lospasaporte.com", "title": "Pasaporte - Detente (Oficial)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-30T01:22:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "87VJIPBIo4w", "description": "\u2732 Hope you enjoy my new video! \u2732\n\u2192 watch in HD 720p :) \na like and comment would be much appreciated!\n\n\u25bbMY FIRST MERLIN RELATED VIDEO!

Discovering this kind of causal relationships can help us prevent or correct negative outcomes caused by their antecedents. In this paper, we propose an innovative data mining framework and apply it to mine potential causal associations in electronic patient data sets where the drug-related events of interest occur infrequently. Specifically, we created a novel interestingness measure, exclusive causal-leverage, based on a computational, fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we previously developed. On the basis of this new measure, a data mining algorithm was developed to mine the causal relationship between drugs and their associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The algorithm was tested on real patient data retrieved from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan. The retrieved data included 16,206 patients (15,605 male, 601 female). The exclusive causal-leverage was employed to rank the potential causal associations between each of the three selected drugs (i.e., enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) and 3,954 recorded symptoms, each of which corresponded to a potential ADR. The top10 drug-symptom pairs for each drug were evaluated by the physicians on our project team. The numbers of symptoms considered as likely real ADRs for enalapril, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin were 8, 7, and 6, respectively. These preliminary results indicate the usefulness of our method in finding potential ADR signal pairs for further analysis (e.g., epidemiology study) and investigation (e.g., case review) by drug safety professionals.", "title": "A Method for Mining Infrequent Causal Associations and Its Application in Finding Adverse Drug React", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T20:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "87d5x7AsghU", "description": "Online Conveyancing service for the Vow Financial Network.\n\nFor more info please go to http://www.vowlegal.com.au", "title": "Vow Legal - Online Conveyancing Services for our mortgage broker network", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T07:12:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "87dUh_qdrn0", "description": "The Village Greens is one of the main venues for crafts and goods at the National Arts Festiva in Grahamstownl.CueTube tours the Great Field at Rhodes University to see the food stalls, craft vendors and surprise performances. \n\nReport by Taryn Isaac & Natalie Austin\nSchool of Journalism and Media Studies, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa", "title": "CueTube on the Beat at the Village Green Market", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T18:26:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "87dhdKueQ7c", "description": "I rode the back of the Neon hanging on via the broken out rear window for about 100 feet before the driver finally stopped.

The Leopard 2 is a main battle tank developed by Krauss-Maffei in the early 1970s for the West German Army. The tank first entered service in 1979 and succeeded the earlier Leopard 1 as the main battle tank of the German Army. Various versions have served in the armed forces of Germany and twelve other European countries, as well as several non-European nations. More than 3,480 Leopard 2s have been manufactured.[citation needed] The Leopard 2 first saw combat in Kosovo with the German Army and has also seen action in Afghanistan with the Danish and Canadian contributions to the International Security Assistance Force.\n\nThere are two main development batches of the tank, the original models up to Leopard 2A4, which have vertically faced turret armour, and the \"improved\" batch, namely the Leopard 2A5 and newer versions, which have angled arrow-shaped turret appliqu\u00e9 armour together with other improvements. All models feature digital fire control systems with laser rangefinders, a fully stabilized main gun and coaxial machine gun, and advanced night vision and sighting equipment (first vehicles used a low-light level TV system or LLLTV; thermal imaging was introduced later on). The tank has the ability to engage moving targets while moving over rough terrain.\n\nLeopard 2A6\nIncludes the addition of the Rheinmetall 120 mm L55 smoothbore gun and other changes. All German tank battalions of the \"crisis intervention forces\" are equipped with the A6. Canada purchased 20 Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands. These were delivered in 2007.[40] Portugal also purchased 37 Leopard 2A6 from the Dutch in 2007, with delivery in 2008. In January 2014, Finland purchased 100 L2A6s, as well as munitions, simulators, and a ten-year supply of reserve parts from the Netherlands. The tanks are being delivered in batches between 2015-2019.[41]\n\nThe Leopard 2A6M is a version of the 2A6 with enhanced mine protection under the chassis, and internal enhancements to improve crew survivability.[42] Canada has borrowed 20 A6Ms from Germany for deployment to Afghanistan in late summer 2007. The new tanks all have turret electric drive.\n\nThe Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian variant of the Leopard 2A6M. Significant modifications include distinctive black boxes mounted on the rear of the turret bustle, originally expected to be the new air conditioning unit but instead likely contains Canadian Forces designated communications gear (as they lined up with the new antennae stands),[43] and stand-off slat armour.[44] The first tanks configured in this variant are the twenty tanks loaned from the German Bundeswehr, in an effort to increase firepower and to increase protection given to Canadian troops operating in the south of Afghanistan. The loaner tanks are expected to retain their German MG3 machine guns, while the ex-Dutch tanks are expected to retain their FN MAG machine guns due to commonality with existing Canadian stocks.[45] Due to the loaned status of the first 20 tanks, the air conditioning unit originally could not be installed as only minimal changes could be made (instead, the crew wore cooling vests, and the turret's electric drive generates less heat than the hydraulic drive of Canada's older Leopard C2). The loaned German tanks will now be kept by the Canadian Forces and may be upgraded even further, while the ex-Dutch Leopard 2A6's were modified to German Leopard 2A6M's specifications and used as restitution for the loaned tanks.[46] Currently, Canadian Leopard 2's in Afghanistan have since been fitted with an air conditioning unit, and the Saab Barracuda camouflage mats which also serve to reduce solar loading by 50 percent.[9]\n\nThe Leopard 2 Hel is a derivative of the 2A6, ordered by the Greek Army in 2003. The \"Hel\" stands for \"Hellenic\". The 170 tanks were to be delivered between 2006 and 2009. A total of 140 will be built in Greece by ELBO, which delivered the first units in late 2006.[47]\n\nThe Leopard 2E is a derivative of the 2A6, with greater armour protection,[48] developed under a program of co-production between the defence industries of Spain and Germany. The program was developed within the frame of collaboration decided in 1995 between the Defence Ministries of both countries, in which also was included the cession of use by a period of five years of 108 Leopard 2A4 from the German Army to the Spanish Army. However, this cession was extended up to 2016, and after that those tanks will be the sole property of the Spanish Army, as has been made public on 24 January 2006, then having been paid a total of 15,124,014 euros in ten yearly installments, giving the Spanish co-ownership from 2006. In 1998, the Spanish government agreed to contract 219 tanks of the Leopard 2E line, 16 recovery tanks Leopard 2ER (Bufalo) and 4 training vehicles. They chose Santa B\u00e1rbara Sistemas as the main contractor.", "title": "PRIDE OF NATO German military Leopard 2 A6 Main Battle Tank", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T07:09:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "87eQ1BURhJk", "description": "", "title": "L\u00e9gendes urbaines au Lyc\u00e9e Maillol de Perpignan", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T09:58:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "87eYB3HuBO4", "description": "Meet Libby, also known as The Hobby Hoarder.

This is what the corner looks like with the piece cut out. And there are two main ways that you can tie off this blanket. The first is a very simple, overhand kind of knot. You'll take your slash piece, you want both pieces, top and bottom, and kind of stretch it out a little bit, and you'll use your finger to make a little loop. And you want to pull the end of the fringe through the loop. Make sure you get both pieces of fabric and there you go.  You want to make that you pull the knot close to the blanket side just like that. So this is what this knot looks like once you have it tied. It's a really cute knot and you'll notice that it's a good way to have your blue showing on your black side. \n\nNow I'm going to show you a second knot to do tie your blanket together. It's a really simple square knot. You're going to take your fringe, two pieces, and then instead of being together this time, you want them separate.  You'll take one piece in your left hand and one piece on your right, and you'll do left over right. Make a really simple tie and pull. And then you're going to do the opposite to make the knot. You're going to take right and put it over left. Put the fringe through and pull. It makes a little bow.\n\nOkay. So we are almost finished tying off all the fringe on our no sew fleece blanket.

One day, it might be lots of targeted keywords. The next day, it might be something else entirely. \n\nUnless you use a search engine optimization program like SEO Elite or manually track what each of the search engines are looking for on a daily basis, then you won't know how to get your web site to rank well with each of the major search engines.\n\nSecond, every search engine uses different things to come up with their rankings. If Google gives a higher ranking for having one factor... then another search engine might ignore or even penalize your web site for having it! \n\nThird, when most people use a search engine to do a search, they won't look past the first page of listings. If they are highly motivated to find what they are looking for, then they might look through two or three pages of listings. \n\nBut that's rare. \n\nSo unless your web site has a keyword that scores well with a search engine, then it can be very difficult to get listed on the first page. \n\nFourth, every competitor of yours is also vying for the first page of the search engines. And they are trying to make it for the same keywords that you do. \n\nIf you want to rank higher than your competitors than you have to prove that your site is more \"worthy\" and deserves to be ranked higher. (I'll explain in a few minutes how to become more \"worthy\".) \n\nFifth, most website owners think that search engines are their friends. \n\nNot true. \n\nSearch engines are friendly to their customers \u2014 who are using their search engine. In fact, search engines value their own customers so much that any website which doesn't provide useful information... could find themselves falling in rank \u2014 or be dropped from the search engine completely!\n\nHere's Some Even Worse News \u2014 Search Engines Aren't \nthe Only Traffic Source Going Through Some Big Changes!\nIf the threat of search engine traffic drying up was the only problem that marketers were facing, it wouldn't be nearly as bad. Some marketers would make changes to their business so their websites stayed in the good graces of the search engines and continue to get lots of targeted traffic.\n\nOthers might struggle for a while, but they would start looking for other traffic sources to draw from. \n\nThe problem is... search engines aren't the only traffic source starting to dry up. Some of the others have gotten worse! Here's what I mean...\n\n\n \nPay Per Click: As a general rule, the higher your ad lists in a search engine like Google, the more prospects will see your ad and be sent to your site. Unfortunately, the business with the biggest budget can out-bid everyone else and get the top ranking spot in any pay per click engine. \n\nLet me give you an example.\n \nHow about Directory Submitter?\n\nDomain Information: directorysubmitter.imwishlist.com - Directory Submitter\nWebsite Title: Internet Marketing Wish List | Directory Submitter \u00bb Directory Submitter  \nKeywords: No Keywords Defined \nMeta Description: No Description \nGoogle Pagerank: /10 \nServer IP: 209.68.28.154 united states \nAltavista Links:  471 \nAlltheweb links: 500 \nAlexa Rank: 112294 \nAlexa Backlink: 79 \nYahoo inlink: 42491 \nYahoo indexed : 117 \nOutbound Links: Outbound: 1\n \nInternal Links: Internal: 111\n \n\nIndexed Data\nDMOZ:  No \nDomain Age:  Unknown \n\nhttp://www.GetMineToday.com/bryxen5.htm", "title": "Directory Submitter", "publishedDate": "2009-01-18T18:49:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "884FArp_F4s", "description": "According to the American Cancer Society's Cancer Statistics 2013 article, and its companion publication Cancer Facts & Figures 2013, there has been a 20 percent drop in cancer death rates in the United States since the early 1990s.\n\nIn this video, The Society's John Seffrin, Ph.D. and Dr. Otis Brawley discuss the promising findings.\n\nLearn more about cancer facts and figures for 2013 at http://cancer.org", "title": "Cancer Statistics and Cancer Facts & Figures 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-01-17T16:14:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "884Fukx-0Kk", "description": "Raghunath Timsina (Teacher of Culture and Social Science) on Nepal Unification and Prithvi Narayan Shah's teaching.\nPersonal view, recorded on casual talking, posted with consent.", "title": "Nepal Ekikaran/ Unification Of Nepal111.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T15:31:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "884SDuvXKOo", "description": "The Exotics had several local hits, \"Ginger Snap\" being one of them.

I prefer to work with black iron. It's pretty easy to remove the galvanized coating using hydrochloric acid (HCL). This is available at most hardware stores as muriatic acid, which is never more than 38% HCL. I dilute it with water to 10% to 15%. ... The galvanized coating is zinc, which reacts very strongly with HCL. Iron reacts relatively slowly with HCL, so once the acid dissolves the zinc coating (about 5 minutes) it will hit the iron and have very little further effect. Once the violent bubbling stops you can remove the part and wash it with water.\n\nIf you have never worked with hydrochloric acid then you should educate yourself in its safe handling before attempting to use it. Even the consumer grade stuff from the hardware store will fume vapors that will burn your eyes and lungs. HCL hurts if you get it on your skin, but that's nothing compared to getting the fumes in your eyes or lungs. The violent fizzing of the zinc + HCL reaction will spray a fine mist of acid into the air. Furthermore, the zinc + HCL reaction releases hydrogen gas, which is flammable... but all scary warnings aside, and following reasonable safe handling of HCL, this is a pretty quick and easy way to remove zinc from iron and steel.", "title": "remove galvanization with hydrochloric acid", "publishedDate": "2013-10-16T00:05:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "885NxUvewow", "description": "Listen to this future dentist talk about the possible career ending injury he sustained.", "title": "Dental student extensor tendon laceration x 2", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T23:17:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8861fKjHK9I", "description": "Music video by Alacranes Musical performing Solo Los Tontos.

In this lesson I am going to show you how to form a past perfect continuous and when to use a past perfect continuous. Now let's get started. Take a look at these sentences:\n\nI had been working a lot.\nIt had been snowing.\n\nThey are both in the past perfect continuous tense. \nHow do we form a past perfect continuous? We use the auxiliary verb to have, but we use the past form so 'had.' We use the past participle form of 'to be', been and the base form of the verb and 'ing.' So for the singular forms:\n\nI had been working all afternoon.\nYou had been listening to the radio.\nHe had been sweeping the floor.\nShe had been spending a lot of money.\nIt had been raining all week.\n\nFor the plural forms:\n\nWe had been playing computer games all night.\nYou had been searching for a supermarket. \nThey had been watching the news all afternoon.\n\nWe need to pay special attention to verbs that end in an '-e' such as live, make, close and wipe. These verbs drop their '-e' take a look at the examples:\n\nI had been living there for quite some time.\nHe had been making a lot of noise and they had been wiping the floor for over an hour.\n\nLet's have a look at the past perfect continuous in questions. We use had, we use been, the base from of the verb and 'ing.' \nFor example:\nHad she been talking about him?\nHad you been playing tennis and had they been doing their job. \n\nFor negations we use the past simple form of have which is had, but we add not to it contracting it into hadn't and the past participle form of to\nbe the base form of the verb and 'ing.'\n\nI hadn't been listening to the news.\nShe hadn't been waiting for you for over an hour.\nThey hadn't been paying attention.\n\nNow let's have a look at when we use the past perfect continuous.\nWe use the past perfect continuous for activities that started in the past but before something else in the past.\n\nFor example:\nI had been travelling before I met her.\nSo I started traveling in the past, which lasted for some time and then I met a specific person. All these things were completed in the past.\n\nAnother example is:\nThey had been working as a chauffeur before ore taking a job as a doorman. \nSo first they worked as a chauffeur for quite some time, and then they took another job.", "title": "Past Perfect Continuous Tense - English grammar tutorial video lesson", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T12:14:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "88LQxK8DkfQ", "description": "en vivo en la vendimia de Ica 2014", "title": "Vortex Revolution In Pollux live", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T18:44:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "88LZ1SUmNRM", "description": "of course your not a shirt lifter!", "title": "Timmy andrews \"cheering\" us up", "publishedDate": "2008-10-19T17:48:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "88LfDVcvLuo", "description": "Title: Omission \nArtist: Jerico\nAlbum: Suspicious Prediction\nCircle: Jerico's Law\nOriginal: Ghost Lead\nEvent: M3-29", "title": "\u3010M3-29\u3011\u3010Jerico's Law\u3011 Suspicious Prediction- Omission", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T21:43:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "88MBCyiaPSM", "description": "Here's a video from the Evaluate section in the \"Pure Substances and Mixtures\" 5E Lesson.

The Airport's IATA code -- \"BOM\", is derived from Bombay, Mumbai's former name. The airport is the second busiest airport in India in terms of overall passenger traffic. The airport has five operating terminals spread over an operational area of 1,500 acres (610 ha) and is India's and South Asia's largest and most important airline hub; CSIA handled 30.74 million passengers and 656,369 tonnes of cargo during FY 2011-12. Along with Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, it handles more than half of the air traffic in South Asia. \n\nThe year 2006 witnessed a momentous change for the airports in India with the privatization of Mumbai's CSIA. On 3rd of May 2006, the consortium led by GVK was awarded the mandate to modernize and redevelop CSIA. Modernization and redevelopment of CSIA is a reflection of India's rapid growth. Being in the financial capital and a key gateway of the country, redevelopment of CSIA holds great significance in aiding the city to retain its fast paced growth.The transformation of CSIA, a brown-field project, is a one-of-its-kind unique infrastructural project in the world, unlike any other airport development projects.With a vision to become one of the world's best airports, MIAL has been continuously and consistently upgrading CSIA to an airport that delights its guests by offering best in class comfort and convenience.In order to achieve a global standard, MIAL has partnered with well-known international experts for airport design and operations. CSIA handled traffic of 29.1 million passengers and around 670,2 35 tonnes of cargo in the FY 2010-2011.\n\nCSIA's visual identity has been an integral part of its modernization process. With the launch of CSIA's new face, it became the first Indian airport to receive a unique visual identity. Derived from a peacock feather, the acronym 'CSIA' has been woven seamlessly in the logo. The new identity symbolizes the three essential attributes: Pride in India, People of India and Global Standards. CSIA's Services and facilities include: \n\n    Airline Lounges\n    Airline Ticket Counters\n    ATMs\n    Baggage Reclaim\n    Check-in Counters/Self Check-in Kiosk\n    Childcare\n    Forex Services\n    Inter Terminal Transfers\n    Left Luggage Facility\n    Medical Services\n    Parking Facility\n    Postal Services\n    Prayer Room\n    Smoking Lounge\n    Special Needs Passengers\n    Wi-Fi\n\nSource: http://www.csia.in\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Whenever I think of pinched harmonics the first person I think of is Billy Gibbons the guitarist for ZZ Top. A lot of other great players have made nice use of pinched harmonics as well. One of the things to keep in mind is that there are harmonics five, seven, and twelve frets away from every note as well as in other positions. For more details, I did do another Howcast lesson on harmonics, so you should check that out.\n\nLet's look at the position of the second fret, F sharp minor. My clearest harmonics here are twelve frets away. That's the fourteenth fret. So, just for demonstration, I'm going to use my first finger and I'm going to pick each harmonic. If I were to tap those it would sound like this. \n\nOkay. So, these aren't good for pinched harmonics because it's very hard to pick up here. What I want to do is go twelve frets higher, right. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. Now, here I start to run out of room. So, I have to use the pick-up or the body of the guitar to memorize where I am. Now, using pinching technique I can find the harmonics. So, I'm just picking the note. As I pick the note my thumb is supposed to go over the harmonic. Now, I have to find this. No. There we go. Okay. \n\nSo this is easy to remember because on this guitar it's pretty much right in the line of the pick-up. On another guitar it might be above the screw of the pick-up, and it's going to be in a different place for each key. A big part of this is memorizing where the harmonics are on the guitar. But since I know where the main harmonic is for F sharp I can figure out where the rest of the notes are. Alright, it's rough, but basically that's this pentatonic and harmonics.\n\nWhen playing pinched harmonics it really helps to be on the treble pick-up. It helps to have a lot of distortion, too. I can continue through the scale and play harmonics. Okay. \n\nHaving mapped out the harmonics I can now play some licks and just throw in pinched harmonics here and there. Check it out. \n\nSo, with pinched harmonics you sort of have to guess where they are. You're not going to nail them every time, but when you do nail them they sound cool. \n\nI hope you've enjoyed this lesson on pinched harmonics.", "title": "How to Play Pinch Harmonics | Heavy Metal Guitar", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T07:40:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "88TTZ-S4bSk", "description": "Fernandes EAA400E into the laptop mic and some lyrics that I'm not sure where I was going to.
