At first, the body shell was entirely stripped and all elements which were considered unnecessary were removed. This allowed a widening of the body on both sides by 8 cm. The weight of the car was reduced to 1.150 kg due to the use of fibreglass cowl, new hardtop as well as company's front fender. The Opel GT by M\u00e4dchen & Motoren is powered by the 6.2 litre Corvette LS3 engine with a hot cam, other valves and a carbon airbox.

Factor Finders provides this cash easily with flexible options. Learn more here: http://www.factorfinders.com/distributors-factoring\n\n-Distributors, Importers and Resellers offer terms to their customers that may actually put a delay on receiving much-needed cash. Such a delay can block your business from  meeting its objectives, taking on new clients and accepting new distribution orders. Because of this you, may try to depend on business loans or other types of business funding to get things running as usual. Unfortunately, these other forms of financing can carry fees that can break your company through debt. Distributor Factoring steps in to advance cash to these companies that experience slow-payments so that they can continue business. The process simply allows you to sell your unpaid invoices in exchange for cash advancement.  To engage in invoice factoring, you don't need to be a perfect business. The presence of slow-paying customers, rejection from banks, poor credit and seasonal sales patterns can all actually qualify your firm for factoring. This is because we check your customer's creditworthiness instead of focusing on your financial performance or ability to pay a loan. Other factoring services we provide to finance your business include purchase order financing, asset based lending, and government contract receivables financing.  The requirements for invoice factoring isn't complicated either. Here's what we need. - Application, an accounts receivable aging report, a customer list, copy of articles of incorporation, and your invoices to factor. With distributor factoring, distribution firms are able to dodge the pitfalls that come with other funding methods while obtaining cash fast.

This protein possesses a large C-terminal membrane-spanning domain preceded by two soluble cytoplasmic domains that are together termed `NFeoB'. The first of these soluble domains is a GTPase domain (G-domain), which is then followed by an entirely [alpha]-helical domain. GTP hydrolysis by the G-domain is essential for iron uptake by FeoB, and various NFeoB mutant proteins from Streptococcus thermophilus have been constructed. These mutations investigate the role of conserved amino acids from the protein's critical Switch regions. Five crystal structures of these mutant proteins have been determined. The structures of E66A and E67A mutant proteins were solved in complex with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, the structures of T35A and E67A mutant proteins were solved in complex with GDP and finally the structure of the T35S mutant was crystallized without bound nucleotide. As an ensemble, the structures illustrate how small nucleotide-dependent rearrangements at the active site are converted into large rigid-body reorientations of the helical domain in response to GTP binding and hydrolysis. This provides the first evidence of nucleotide-dependent helical domain movement in NFeoB proteins, suggesting a mechanism by which the G-protein domain could structurally communicate with the membrane domain and mediate iron uptake.\n\nRead the paper here :http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0907444911039461", "title": "A suite of Switch I and Switch II mutant structures from the G-protein domain of FeoB", "publishedDate": "2013-10-14T14:50:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "73JR2XSHS7o", "description": "www.minerals-passion.com\nfacebook.com/mineralspassion", "title": "Chrysocolla , Malachite , Quartz , Chalcedony , some trace of Cuprite", "publishedDate": "2013-07-15T18:10:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "73JmNJHZEAE", "description": "", "title": "ARIJIT SINGH live in concert - Muscat, Oman", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T11:54:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "73JsO82_SII", "description": "The Common Linnets - Love goes on\nGespeeld v\u00f3\u00f3r de uitzending van De Wereld Draait Door van 12-03-14", "title": "The Common Linnets - Love goes on - DWDD 12-03-14", "publishedDate": "2014-03-15T15:30:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "73K2jZZSX50", "description": "", "title": "United's fans cheering for Ronaldo", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T07:28:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "73K3bvV5_Zk", "description": "REKT.

Amongst many other black projects, a team of British scientists working at an Infinitum Research experimental station stumbled across some remarkable phenomena involving DNA manipulation. This led to deeper research with dangerously unpredictable results, often leading to human patients losing their lives in irresponsible and immoral experiments.\n\nTime passed on, and by the mid 1990s the failure rate of the experiments had been reduced from 75% to a mere 15%, enough for Infinitum to move onto the next stage: Biological Light Refraction. The British team were hoping to unravel the possibilities of light manipulation to create the perfect covert military agent. Early into the new millennium, due to a gross miscalculation, a series of tests on Subject 617 led to a massive synaptic trauma leaving the patient with multiple genetic anomalies.\n\nThe subject was left in constant pain and with unstable DNA. The subject escaped captivity, killing anyone that got in its way. The I.R.I.S. (Infinitum Research Interception Squad) team have been deployed to return the subject to a maximum security Infinitum Research facility for further study and dissection. The entire project was considered a failure: all funding ceased and development was discontinued while all records and traces of the experiments were destroyed. Infinitum Research denies all knowledge of any form of human DNA manipulation but are more than happy to comment on the possibilities of cloning human organs inside suitable animal donors. It is believed that these organ cloning experiments form the main cover for their human genetic manipulation experimentations.\n\nSubject 617, known as 'The Hidden', must turn the tables and become the hunter instead of the hunted as the I.R.I.S. team close their net around him.\"\n\nJuicetra: http://www.youtube.com/user/juicetra\nJericho: http://www.youtube.com/user/IIJERiiCHOII\nGoldGlove: http://www.youtube.com/user/GoldGloveTV\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "HUNTED BY MARILYN MANSON (The Hidden)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-12T16:03:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "73PC6xOMtIA", "description": "ProdBy DaEmond\n039records Peje\nLufta e Artit\nREAL RAP, Diss skenes politike kosov", "title": "Gjikla - Juda(diss Politikes)", "publishedDate": "2009-12-10T21:00:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "73PTL_14Hxk", "description": "", "title": "Ti\u1ec1m H\u00e0nh Truy K\u00edch -  Lives of Omission OST - \u795e\u9397\u72d9\u64ca - Michael.mp4", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T14:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "73PW56YHvXs", "description": "An 18-foot great white attacks a shark cage while a diver is trapped inside. | For more Shark Week, visit http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week/#mkcpgn=ytdsc1\n\nSubscribe to Discovery! | http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=discoverynetworks", "title": "18-Foot Shark Attacks Cage | Great White Serial Killer - Shark Week 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T13:00:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "73Pa6FtmnWk", "description": "This is a hidden clip that shot while I'm in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Whether they are present, and to what degree can make a difference in plea bargaining, negotiation, and sentencing. Whether your offense is a violation, misdemeanor, or even a felony the factors we come into play at some level of your proceedings.\n\nThe factors have a wide and diverse range:\n\n1. Your job (employment history)\n2. Drug, mental, & alcohol counseling or treatment or rehabilitation.\n3. No Accident (the lack of property damage and/or people damage)\n4. Your cooperation and respect (during and after the arrest)\n5. Education \n6. No weapons or violence.\n7. Your low BAC number in a DWI case\n8. Your age\n9. No Prior offenses or no criminal history\n10. Restitution. Paying back for damages to property.\n\nThis video explores some common factors used in New York criminal cases.\n\nRead more about the factors in my blog, Aggravators & Mitigators:\n\nhttp://ithacadwi.blogspot.com/2012/01/aggravators.html\n\nI am a member of the NCDD (National College of DUI Defense), and a co-author of Strategies for Defending DWI Cases in New York, 2011 ed.: Leading Lawyers on Understanding Today's DWI Environment, Constructing a Defense Strategy, and Counseling Clients (Inside the Minds) New Edition\n\nhttp://west.thomson.com/productdetail/180677/41015444/productdetail.aspx\n\nTo learn more about how DWI and injury cases work in the state of New York, I encourage you to explore my educational website http://www.ithacadwi.com.

Placing an anchor casting in the concrete's substrate allows the bollard to be secured with a threaded rod and nut. It is important to note that, with this installation method, the bike bollard will not offer a great level of impact resistance. When installed in this manner, the primary function of the bollard will be bicycle storage. Available in many finishes and styles, Reliance Foundry offers a vast array of bollards that can be fitted with secure bike-locking arms.

Taken aback by this square-jawed genocide, Quigley grabs Marston and hurls him through a window. Marston, who controls the region, sets out to hunt Quigley down. But helping him stay one step ahead of Marston is the addlebrained expatriate American trollop Crazy Cora (Laura San Giacomo) who insists that Quigley is her husband Roy.\n\n\"quigley down under\",\"quigley down under clip\",\"quigley down under trailer\",\"quigley down under part 1\",\"accuracy videos\",\"crazy cora\",\"rifle videos\",\"tom selleck\",\"simon wincer\",westerns,\"action adventure\",\"bucket videos\",\"horse videos\",\"alexandra rose\",\"alan rickman\",\"affirmation videos\",\"laura san giacomo\",\"stanley otoole\",\"farm videos\",\"matthew quigley\",\"elliott marston\",\"countryside videos\",\"megan rose\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++39912,/m/09y20,/m/0300lh", "title": "Quigley Down Under (2/11) Movie CLIP - Proving Himself (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T02:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "73i1kwzM4b0", "description": "Wodal stands for World of Darkness Arbitrary Language and is a mod for Vampire the Masquerade - Redemption  that is designed to bring the gameplay mechanics closer to Pen & Paper rules.

Ong (Internist and Cardiologist)\n\nWhile it is true that the aging process cannot be stopped, there are still many things we can do to delay and slow down aging. So no matter what age you are, let us learn how to have beautiful and healthy-looking skin.\n1. Avoid the sun -- Sunlight is the primary cause of wrinkles and aging. Thus, we should avoid the sun from 10 AM to 3 PM. Use a sunscreen daily that has at least an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30. It may seem that young people are immune to the deadly rays of the sun. However, be aware that the wrinkles and age spots will come out 15 to 20 years after sun exposure. Therefore, wear a hat, bring an umbrella, and avoid the sun.\n2. Stop smoking and avoid alcohol -- Studies show that cigarette smoking can double the fine lines on your face. Smoking also decreases your cell's oxygen content and slows down the skin's ability to repair itself. Constant puffing will cause wrinkles to form around the mouth area. Similarly, alcohol can damage your blood vessels and dehydrate the skin. Heavy drinking can result in puffy and wrinkled skin, giving your skin a dull and lifeless look.\n3. Be weather-conscious -- Skin can be damaged by very hot or very cold weather. Strong wind, dust and pollution cause wrinkles to form in your face. By all means, avoid riding a motorcycle because the wind, sun and dust will damage your beautiful skin.\n4. Get enough sleep -- Sleeping and resting are the easiest way to boost your energies. At night, try to go for 8 hours of sleep. This will help your body regenerate and give you a vibrant-looking skin.\n5. Limit stress -- Stress and too much work are factors that hasten the aging process. If you're a workaholic, it is possible that your calendar age is 40 years old, but you already have the arteries of a 55-year-old man. Conditions like diabetes and heart disease can age you faster than normal. \n6. Clean your face -- After a long day, you should clean your skin thoroughly. My wife, Dr. Liza Ong, uses cotton balls dabbed in an alcohol-based astringent to clean her face. Cleaning the face will remove dirt, excess oil, make-up and dead skin cells.\n7. Moisturize your skin -- After cleaning your face, you can use a moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. Moisturizer is especially helpful if you have dry, flaky skin. The cheeks and neck areas are the usual dry areas, while the eyebrows and nose area are the usual oily areas.\n8. Be gentle -- When touching your face, like washing or applying creams and make-up, be sure to use gentle strokes. The skin around the eyes is particularly thin and prone to wrinkles. Use light, upward strokes, rather than dragging your skin downwards. As we age, the loss of skin elasticity and the pull of gravity cause our skin to sag.\n9. Use clever make-up -- Choose make-up products containing UV filters and skin-nourishing ingredients. Use the latest light-reflecting kinds of foundations, concealers and powders. These products bounce off light and make your skin look younger and smoother.\n10. Eat wisely -- Eat lots of colorful fruits, vegetables and salads. Choose high-fiber foods. Foods with vitamins A, C, and E are beneficial for the skin. Vitamin A, found in carrots and spinach, repairs skin tissues.

This \"simple fix\" video is intended especially for STUDENTS who are in a pinch and have very few tools or resources nearby! This video shows how to revive almost any laptop that keeps turning itself off, or shuts off while it's being used due to an \"overheating condition\" (without any special tools or taking anything apart). The fix shown in this video deals with a VERY common problem that so many laptops will have. The common cause of \"overheating\" is often a hidden dust build-up on the fan, heat sink, and/or internal parts!\nIMPORTANT NOTE! There is always a possibility that the laptop fan could become \"jammed-up\" with the dust that is blown back from the processor heat sink while doing this cleaning procedure, so be warned! The odds are very slight, but they ARE there! If this situation occurs, I would (and have in the past) used a vacuum hose from something like a shop vac, or something similar to get the dust off the fan allowing it to spin free. Myself, I would power off the laptop, place the vacuum suction near the \"fan inlet\" vent to achieve this. The vacuum will dislodge the dust, and the fan will start to spin. DO NOT let the fan spin up at a fast rate of speed as damage to the fan could occur. I have cleaned many laptops, and by using the procedure described here and in this video, I have always had success. I have never had to take a laptop apart because of a dust build-up.\nBTW, ANY laptop (AND PC) that moves air \"into and out of itself\" with a fan, will be susceptible to a dust build-up, eventually leading to an overheating condition.\n\nSymptoms of laptop over-heating may include (but are not limited to)\n\u2022 A very noisy or racing cooling fan with little air coming out from the laptop.  \n\u2022 If any air is coming out from the laptop, it is quite hot! (It should only be warm)\n\u2022 No cooling fan sound, because the fan is stuck from dust build-up.\n\u2022 The bottom of the laptop near the fan area getting very hot.\n\u2022 Laptop performance slowing down, or the laptop is shutting off completely because the laptop is trying to protect itself from damage caused by an excessive heat build-up.\n\nnote;- This video shows a \"general method of cleaning\" that can be used if tools/equipment are not available. It would be helpful to check the owner/user's manual of YOUR device to get clarification on the cleaning procedure of your laptop vents. Every laptop has a different configuration. \n\nPLEASE NOTE. There are times when a laptop will turn off because of a virus or malware, hardware or software problems/conflicts as well. If you believe your Windows laptop is \"not\" overheating, I would download and run (from microsoft.com/downloads) the \"Microsoft malicious software removal tool\"(There is a NEW updated one every week.). A FULL scan MUST be done in my opinion. This will take hours, but it is well worth it. If the tool does find problems, make absolutely sure YOU ARE running an antivirus program on your laptop. Many new laptops come with \"trial versions\" that expire leaving the unsuspecting user vulnerable! Reboot the laptop afterwards, run \"Windows update\" and install all recommended updates. Reboot the laptop again, then try it afterwards. \n\nDISCLAIMER; - This video is shown as a sample of what \"I did\"! I WILL NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY in any way/shape/or form for damage/ injuries/ problems/ loss/loss of data that occur to anyone or anything as the result of seeing/trying to follow this video or the notes contained in it or in the description!

Al meer dan 20 jaar staat deze band aan de top van het Nederlandse feestcircuit, volgens sommigen hebben ze het feestrepertoire zelfs uitgevonden. Feit is in ieder geval dat de karakteristieke combinatie van humor, theater, feest en gezelligheid vaak is gekopieerd maar zelden tot nooit is overtroffen.\n\nEn wat ook prettig is, De Sjonnies zijn niet alleen de leukste band van Nederland, ze hebben toevallig ook nog het leukste publiek van Nederland. Een publiek waar je graag bij wil horen. Ook voor kroegeigenaren en festival-organisaties is de band al jaren een zekerheidje, vooral omdat elk optreden gegarandeerd bieromzet-proof is.\n\nWaar De Sjonnies met recht trots op zijn is dat in het eerste decennium van deze eeuw (2000-2009) geen enkele Nederlandse band zoveel optredens heeft gescoord als De Sjonnies. In deze gloriejaren kon je eenvoudigweg niet om ze heen, en als het aan de heren ligt zal dat voorlopig nog wel zo blijven.\n\nAnno 2012 zijn De Sjonnies weer helemaal terug van nooit weggeweest. Met de line-up Paddo, Friso Ruysdael en de nieuwe liedzanger Tommie Transvaal staat de band sterker dan ooit. De tour voor 2013 is al weer voor een deel ingevuld, een avondvullend programma is al helemaal rond en in de loop van volgend jaar staat er een nieuw album op stapel met uitsluitend nieuw repertoire.\n\nSongtekst- Blauw van de Sangria\n\nTekst: Konstantijn Ruysdael\n\n\nIeder jaar in juli dan zit heel mijn auto weer vol\nJa dan gaan we met vakantie naar de Costa del Sol\nNa de eerste dag lig ik al uitgeteld\nBen ik door dat Spaanse fruit geveld\n\nREFREIN\nJa ja zo blauw blauw blauw van de sangria\nLig ik op het strand, de fles nog in mijn hand\nHasta la vista ol\u00e9 aan de Middellandse Zee\nDe groetjes thuis in Nederland\nLalala....\n\nIn het eerste kroeggie daar heb ik alleen maar wat gesjanst\nIn het tweede kroeggie daar heb ik de flamenco gedanst\nIn de derde kroeg daar werd ik toreador\nAan het eind zong iedereen in koor\n\nREFREIN\nJa ja zo blauw blauw blauw van de sangria\nLig ik op het strand, de fles nog in mijn hand\nHasta la vista ol\u00e9 aan de Middellandse Zee\nDe groetjes thuis in Nederland\nJa ja zo blauw blauw blauw van de sangria\nLig ik op het strand, de fles nog in mijn hand\nHasta la vista ol\u00e9 aan de Middellandse Zee\nDe groetjes thuis\nAan Sonja, Linda, Bea, Frea, Marloes, tante Thea, Roos, Viola, Albert en natuurlijk aan mijn schoonzusje \nin Nederland\nLalala....\n\nREFREIN\nJa ja zo blauw blauw blauw van de sangria\nLalalalala..\nHasta la vista ol\u00e9 aan de Middellandse Zee\nDe groetjes thuis \nO ja en aan oma in Huize Vogelenzang \nin Nederland\n\nDe Sjonnies kun je boeken bij:\nWINGS PRODUCTIONS\nTELEFOON: 024 324 48 96\nEMAIL: INFO@WINGSPRODUCTIONS.NL\nADRES: GERARD NOODSTRAAT 12\n6511 SW NIJMEGEN, NEDERLAND\nhttp://wingsproductions.nl\nhttp://sjonnies.com", "title": "De Sjonnies - Blauw van de Sangria", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T09:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "74egQ77gJX4", "description": "I cant wait new parts and milling :)\nSee more on Facebook :) https://www.facebook.com/WnukuLaboratory", "title": "My new steel homemade cnc router X axis first start :)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T19:24:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "74ezTBSuKy0", "description": "\u00a9 2007 WMG \n'Living Room' by Tegan and Sara.

Recycling the leaves into new soil is a great way to keep leaves out of the landfill, or leaf ash out of the air.\n\n\nStep 1: Wait until the leaves have turned brown\nWait until the leaves have started to turn brown before you rake them up. If you have a lawn mower or a leaf shredder, shred the leaves before raking them. Both of these techniques help the leaves to compost more quickly.\n\nStep 2: Place the leaves in a bag\nPlace the leaves in a burlap bag and set it near the compost pile.\n\nStep 3: Add handfuls of leaves to the compost pile\nAdd a few handfuls of leaves from the bag to the compost pile at a time. If you add too many at once, they mat together and slow down the composting process.\n\nStep 4: Maintain a chemical balance\nMaintain a balance between carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich materials in the compost pile. Brown leaves are rich in carbon. Kitchen scraps (not meat), fruit and vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, and grass clippings are rich in nitrogen. The nutrient-rich compost pile should consist of two-thirds carbon-rich materials and one-third nitrogen-rich materials.\n\nTip\nAs nitrogen-rich materials are added to the compost pile, toss a few leaves on top.\n\nStep 5: Compost leaves only\nBuild a 4-foot diameter by 3-foot high leaf-only compost pile if you have too many leaves to put in the main compost pile. Place a layer of soil between each foot of leaves. Keep the pile damp, but covered so that it does not become waterlogged. Leaf compost is best used as organic soil amendment and conditioner rather than as nutrient-rich compost.\n\nDid You Know?\nIn fall, cork-like layers of cells between the leaves and the stems in deciduous trees block the production of the green chlorophyll, making the leaves turn yellow or red.", "title": "How to Compost Autumn Leaves", "publishedDate": "2010-12-20T20:08:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "74pPP8PM_6Y", "description": "http://feelgoodtime.net/what-is-horehound-herb-marrubium-vulgare/ - Horehound herb, Marrubium Vulgare has erect and hairy stems of 30-40 cm, which rises from the spindle root.

Christians believe Jesus to be the awaited Messiah of the Old Testament and refer to him as Jesus Christ or simply Christ, a name that is also used by non-Christians.\nVirtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that a historical Jesus existed, although there is little agreement on the reliability of the gospel narratives and their assertions of his divinity. Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of the Roman prefect, Pontius Pilate. Scholars have constructed various portraits of the historical Jesus, which often depict him as having one or more of the following roles: the leader of an apocalyptic movement, Messiah, a charismatic healer, a sage and philosopher, or an egalitarian social reformer.Scholars have correlated the New Testament accounts with non-Christian historical records to arrive at an estimated chronology of Jesus' life.\nMost Christians believe that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, from which he will return. The majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three Persons of a Divine Trinity. A few Christian groups reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.\nIn Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets. To Muslims, Jesus is a bringer of scripture and the child of a virgin birth, but neither divine nor the victim of crucifixion. Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh. Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scripture almost never refers to Jesus as the Messiah, but calls him a Manifestation of God.\n \nEtymology of names:\nA typical Jew in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes supplemented with the father's name or the individual's hometown. Thus, in the Christian Bible, Jesus is referred to as \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (NRSV, Matthew 26:71), \"Joseph's son\" (Luke 4:22), and \"Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth\" (John 1:45). The name Jesus, which occurs in several languages, is derived from the Latin Iesus, a transliteration of the Greek \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (Iesous). The Greek form is a rendition of the Aramaic \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u200e (Yeshua), which is derived from the Hebrew \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u200e (Yehoshua). The name Yeshua appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus. The first-century works of historian Flavius Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with this name. The etymology of Jesus' name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as \"Yahweh saves\", \"Yahweh will save\", or \"Yahweh is salvation\".\n\nMusic credit to:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\".\nLicensed under Creative Commons \n\"Attribution 3.0\" \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nLicence for Images in video:\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\nThis file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.", "title": "Jesus - Who is Jesus", "publishedDate": "2013-09-14T20:34:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "75BM2O8ytZs", "description": "This is a short clip of a gyroscope undergoing precession and nutation.", "title": "Precession and Nutation", "publishedDate": "2008-02-16T01:14:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "75BMC0Ku82M", "description": "Whether it's for a bridal bouquet, a holiday event, a building lobby, Big Apple Florist in Midtown Manhattan has a floral arrangement to suit the space or event.

The fruit is popular throughout Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and parts of East Asia. The tree is also cultivated throughout non-indigenous tropical areas, such as in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the southern United States.\n\nThe fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually five, but can sometimes vary); in cross-section, it resembles a star, hence its name. The entire fruit is edible and is usually eaten out of hand. They may also be used in cooking, and can be made into relishes, preserves, and juice drinks.\n\nThe Hornbill festival held in the first week of December shows that with its stunning natural beauty and great cultural traditions, Nagaland can offer a rich fare to tourists.\n\nOrganized by the State Tourism and Art & Culture Departments, Hornbill Festival showcases a m\u00e9lange of cultural displays under one roof. This festival usually takes place between the 1st and the 7th of December every year in Kohima.Festival highlights include the Traditional Naga Morungs Exhibition and sale of Arts and Crafts, Food Stalls, Herbal Medicine Stalls, Flower shows and sales, Cultural Medley - songs and dances, Fashion shows, Beauty Contest, Traditional Archery, Naga wrestling, Indigenous Games, and Musical concert.\n\nThe Hornbill Festival provides a colourful mixture of dances, performances, crafts, parades, games, sports, food fairs and religious ceremonies. The festival both exposes the culture and tradition of tribal peoples, and reinforces Nagaland's identity as a unique state in India's federal union.\n\nTraditional arts are also featured, with paintings, wood carvings and sculptures by modern Naga artists on display. Naga troupes sing folk songs, perform traditional dances and play indigenous games and sports. In the evenings a programme of music concerts, catering for all tastes, ensure that the festive spirit continues through the night.\nHornbill Festival is held at Naga Heritage Village, Kisama which is about 12 km from Kohima. All the tribes of Nagaland take part in this festival. The aim of the festival is to revive and protect the rich culture of Nagaland and display its extravaganza and traditions.\n\nFor visitors it means a closer understanding of the people and culture of Nagaland, and an opportunity to experience the food, songs, dances and customs of Nagaland.\n\nsource - Wikipedia, http://www.hornbillfestival.com/\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The pain means they are alive. I am very very confident I will be successful.)\n\nFOOLS PARADISE - Kick can down road. Lasted over a year. Aspiration only offers temporary solution and relief of symptoms. Situation just gets more hopeless. This tooth is toast. ETA execution date 12-01-12. RECINDED - DECIDED TO REHAB INSTEAD.\n\nWHERE IS MY BONE? - Sir you lost your bone and have nothing left but - DESOLATION AND SACRIFICE.\n\n05-23-11 - irrigation-needle-debridement burst periodontal abscess - First maxillary molar-bicuspid buccal - liberate bloody blobs of periodontal crud - Kendall 23 guage \"half-moon\" endodontic needle. Biotene. Self-dentistry.\n\nSUMMARY - This particular abscess location first burst in around November 2006. Post curettage with Gracey curette. At the time I wasn't really aware of any reasonable ways to rehabilitate except more curettage. But as the area healed and tightened up the deeper areas became more and more inaccessible. I call this area the Upper-Deck. Deep. Controlled access. Festering.\n\nIn November 2010 the upper right molars all went critical. Including stinky-bone. Stalky. Exposed. Critical. Vulnerable. Toast.\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention. I became more aware of irrigation and focused my attention on the 23g Kendal half-moon 1.5 inch endodontic needle. So along with more curettage and traditional irrigation I also explored removing exhudate infection with aspiration.\n\nAs exhudate is removed the localized area becomes healthier and tends to shrink. This in turn exposes deeper areas to the possibility of relieving them with aspiration too. Eventually this process can lead to the bottom of the infection and to removing the exhudate drop by drop.\n\nHere I knew there was a deep area. But I was too afraid to go in deep. Except as a progressive process. Which I can Bulls-eye or the Big O. Object is to work from the periphery until overcome by waves of fear and paranoia and rapidly intensifying pain and obvious clear and present danger. Then stop. Then to give the area a week or so to recover and repeat the process.\n\nThis is what I did here. Finally leading me to the Gates of the Abscess and its liberation.\n\nEPILOGUE - Haven't spent much time here since. But occasionally give it a squirt of the hyaluronic acid and explore and walk the periphery with a Furcator. Also using the HA and other stuff and even honey too as Drilling Mud to drive out latent infection.\n\nBut the nerve is still vulnerable and is literally hanging in the middle of the air. The tooth could turn to toast anytime. Plan is to spend more time with a more sophisticated regenerative strategy. \n\nBut still developing the protocol? Somewhat. Mostly it it is the dicipline. Also incuding tooth conditioning. Largely thing the hyaluronic acid can be used for tooth conditioners.  And to forget about the EDTA or citric acid. Since both can be dangerous. But... if can get everything just so - These things must be done very very carefully very carefully - then can move forward with more ambitious regeneration strategies. But only with total knowledge and commitment and concentration and dicipline for this one particular area. So once put out a few more fires will focus more on regeneration.\n\nRESPONSE - blah blah blah - wake up finally - TOOTH IS TOAST - STOP DREAMING OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT TO BE - While I was living in my Fools Paradise imagining all the nice things I was going to do for my tooth through soothing concoctions and magic potions - most of which I never did much of anyway - the abscess was bubbling away, going deeper and deeper, causing greater and greater destruction. So what use were all my concoctions then?\n\nWHAT COULD I HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY? Knowing what I know now I would have debrided the lingual side of the tooth better. What happened was I was blocked by layers of calculus. IT WAS TOO HARD!! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT IF IT IS TOO HARD SHOULD I? Then the fact that the more difficult areas were never properly debrided because they were too hard to do caused the abscess to destroy the viability of the tooth. Leading to its hopelessness.\n\nCOULD I HAVE SAVED THE TOOTH? Maybe it would have been impossible. The furcation was already tunnelling through the middle of the tooth. Turn into Class III - which is largely considered terminal. But possibly could have kicked the can down the road for a few more years.", "title": "t3 - molar - FOOLS PARADISE -  burst perio abscess w needle - maxillary molar buccal crater", "publishedDate": "2011-06-04T14:08:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "75FmvRwz99Q", "description": "PESEM \u017dIVLJENJE SO ENE \u0160TENGE SKUPINA MALIBU", "title": "\u017dIVLJENJE SO ENE \u0160TENGE MALIBU", "publishedDate": "2008-11-24T03:27:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "75G-feXIRVU", "description": "Shoring systems are temporary supports used after a collapse in order to mitigate hazards.", "title": "Shoring - Taiwan Red Cross org DR SAR Training", "publishedDate": "2006-10-23T09:49:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "75G86Qwvz9g", "description": "Informationstext - Aufgabe - L\u00f6sungen\n\nDer Bulle der Elenantilope frisst ruhig das Besch\u00e4ftigungsfutter, das die Tierpfleger bereitgestellt haben.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day.

The overall sound has also been enhanced, featuring full robust tube sound in a class AB design with three 12AX7 tubes in the pre-amp stage and power amps boasting two EL34 tubes.\n\nThe two-channel design delivers not only the traditional VOX clean and crunch sounds, but also modern high-gain sounds as well. We've also added dedicated cabinets that are a perfect match for the amp heads, making the Night Train G2 a diverse lineup that conveniently covers all your needs for full-tube amps, from compact amp heads and combo amps to large amp heads for studio-class stages. In any music scene, you'll be able to experience serious full-tube sound any time and in any place.\n\nTraditional VOX all tube sound using vacuum tubes in both pre- and power-amps\nVOX's traditional tube sound is alive and well on the Night Train G2. The class AB design delivers awesome power, with a preamp containing three 12AX7 tubes and a power amp containing two EL84 tubes on the NT15H-G2/NT15C1 and two EL34 tubes on the NT50H-G2. With the wide ranging Night Train G2 lineup, you'll enjoy distinctively fat tube amp tone in any situation.\n\nGIRTH/BRIGHT two-channel design provides a wide range of tonal character\nEach model offers up two channels with a differing tonal character: GIRTH and BRIGHT. The GIRTH channel has a powerful modern high-gain sound that's unparalleled even among VOX amps. It's also ideal for the guitarist who seeks an even heavier sound. The BRIGHT channel provides VOX's distinctive clean/crunch sounds and also features a THICK mode that bypasses the tone control circuit and boosts the gain to obtain a thicker tone, achieving a rich variety of tonal character. An optional VFS2A foot switch can be used to switch between the two channels with your foot, for convenience during your live performances.\n\nExcellent expandability\nFor the guitarist who seeks more originality, the Night Train G2 provides send/return jacks that are a convenient way to connect an external effect unit to your amp. You can easily connect your favorite effect units without impairing the potential of the Night Train G2, dramatically expanding your sound-shaping possibilities. The NT50H-G2 also provides a DI output that can be connected to a mixer or PA system. A high-quality reverb has been added to all models, letting you obtain a broad variety of sounds without needing to involve any other equipment.\n\nNew suitcase-type handles overflowing with vintage feel\nLike previous Night Train models, the NT15H-G2 and NT50H-G2 amp heads carry on the cool-looking modern design with VOX's trademark diamond grille and vacuum tube circuitry that's visible through the punched metal. The distinctive mirror finish has been changed to metallic black for an even more distinctive appearance on stage. All models use suitcase-type handles that are brimming with vintage appeal, providing these units with a truly distinctive look.\n\n-Output Power: 50 Watts RMS into 8\u03a9 or 16\u03a9\n\n-Tube Complement: Preamp: 12AX7 (x3) Power amp: EL34 (x2)\n\n-Inputs/Outputs: Guitar input, FX Loop (Send/Return), D.I.

The L-1049 was Lockheed's response to the successful Douglas DC-6 airliner, first flying in 1950. The aircraft was also produced for both the United States Navy and Air Force as transport and AWACS aircraft.\n\nDesigned and built by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to the specification of the legendary Howard Hughes, the Constellation, the world's first commercially successful pressurized airliner, heralded a new post-war era of safe, comfortable and fast transatlantic air travel. This graceful looking aircraft with its long sinuous fuselage - curving downward at the nose and upward at the rear to its distinctive tripletail, became synonymous with the halcyon days of the big Propliners and is still widely regarded with awe and affection.\n\nIn all, 856 Constellations were built, ranging from the first C-69 variant to the magnificent L-1649 Starliner. Sadly 55 years after the first aircraft flew, only a handful remains airworthy as a vibrant reminder of perhaps the most beautiful propliner of them all.\n\nSony HDR-FX7e Camcorder\nRode SVM Microphone\n\nVideo and Audio content is\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Malcolm Auld\n\nThis video and audio material may not be reproduced in any form (except as the videos You tube embedded video option on any other website), without written permission.", "title": "Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation", "publishedDate": "2014-07-20T09:37:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "763LeEckDi0", "description": "students having a ball at massasoit brockton mass", "title": "massasoit limbo", "publishedDate": "2012-10-08T17:46:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "763_W7fGcD0", "description": "Fred The Godson \nThe Sermon\nFat Boy Fresh Mixtape ( http://goo.gl/4td5w9)\nTBM/BlokWork\nDirector: L.E.S\nEditor: L.E.S\nProduction: @VisualAddikts \n\nwww.FredTheGodSon.com", "title": "Fred The Godson - The Sermon | Directed by: L.E.S Official Video", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T16:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "763em1w1gY0", "description": "For more details, please contact us on 5251-2667/8 or send us an e-mail on immoexpress25@gmail.com.", "title": "Coromandel (Chapman's View) - Land - 80 toises @ Rs1.4M", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05T20:47:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7640tnjzR6c", "description": "Experience a bird's eye view of Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort with a ride aboard Characters in Flight, operated by Aerophile.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Colourful tableaus in Deity Procession", "publishedDate": "2013-12-10T17:50:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "76By9DVRCcY", "description": "Thundering herd of Cape Buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at Klopperfontein in the Kruger national Park coming to drink.

Entoptic image is a visual perception that is produced by structures within the eye - in this case vitreous opacities. Patients complain of small specks or dots that can be seen against a bright background such as a diffusely illuminated wall or the blue sky. Sometimes fine dark lines in amorphous mass - like small branching twigs - are seen.\n\n These floaters move around and are also called 'muscae volitantes' because they seem to dart about like flies as the eye is moved. Over time you will become less aware of these floaters as the brain learns to ignore these retinal images. Therefore, while some floaters may remain in your vision, many of them will fade over time and become less bothersome.\nFloaters, if present since a long time or increasing in number very gradually, are harmless. \n\nThey may be annoying but do not cause any problems.

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation. The herbal ingredients that may be used include virgin coconut oil, blueberry leaves, mashed papaya seeds, licorice, dandelion leaves, turmeric powder, bitter neem leaves, chamomile, camphor, aloe vera, spearmint leaves, witch hazel and nutmeg. \n\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\neczema\nAlternative treatments\ntreatments\nmoisturisers\nmoisturising soap substitutes\nitching\nscratching\nbarrier function\ntopical corticosteroids\ninflammation\nflare-ups of eczema\nInflammation\ndry skin\nLichenification\nantimicrobial medicines\ninfection\nimmunosuppressant medicines\nGamolenic acid\nevening primros extract\nTraditional Chinese herbal medicines\nChinese medicine\nUVB light therapy\nPUVA\npsoralen", "title": "Dyshidrotic Eczema Treatment - Managing Dyshidrotic Eczema", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T13:42:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "76EvUdybH_U", "description": "THE FACILITATOR by V\u00edctor Arregui (Ecuador 2013; Drama/Social)\nElena comes back to Ecuador to take care of her ill father.

Diagnosis is based on the clinical features of the disease. Diagnostic imaging should be considered to rule out other causes of hip pain or to establish the diagnosis of GTPS when in doubt. \n\nThe greater trochanter is the site of attachment for the tendons of five muscles: the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus laterally, and the piriformis, obturator externus and obturator internus medially. As in the shoulder, injury and subsequent degeneration may occur in the components of the rotator cuff of the hip, starting with tendonitis, tendinosis, and eventual tear. This process is occuring more commonly in the gluteus medius than the gluteus minimus. \n\nFurthermore, there are three bursas present around the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter, i.e., the subgluteus maximus bursa, the subgluteus medius bursa and the gluteus minimus bursa. These bursas are believed to serve as cushioning for the gluteus tendons, the iliotibial band, and the tensor fascia latae. Trochanteric bursitis occurs mostly secondary to repetitive friction between the greater trochanter and the iliotibial band with hip flexion and extension. Trochanteric bursitis is also often associated with overuse, trauma, or other conditions that may alter normal gait patterns. \n\nGTPS has been reported to affect between 10% and 25% of the general population, with an increased prevalence in women compared to men. \n\nTherapy of symptomatic tendon tears comprises rest, antiinflammatory medications and physiotherapy focusing on range of motion and strengthening exercises. Trochanteric bursitis is usually self-limiting and responds to rest, ice, antiinflammatory medications and physiotherapy focusing on stretching, flexibility, strengthening and gait mechanics. When symptoms persist despite these interventions, bursal injections of local anesthetics and corticosteroid can provide effective pain relief. \n\nRadial shock wave therapy (RSWT) has been demonstrated to be efficient for recalcitrant GTPS. In case of inefficacy of RSWT, surgical intervention may be considered in cases in which other potential sources of the patient's symptoms have been ruled out.", "title": "Swiss DolorClast\u00ae : Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome - (RSWT\u00ae) Radial Shock Wave Therapy", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T07:11:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "76IMjH2nCcc", "description": "de Marivaux / mise en sc\u00e8ne Michel Raskine\nDu mercredi 22 avril au jeudi 7 mai 2015\nPour parvenir \u00e0 approcher l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime que l'on croyait disparu, L\u00e9onide, avec la complicit\u00e9 de sa suivante, d\u00e9cide de se travestir en homme afin de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer plus ais\u00e9ment l'enclos de sagesse o\u00f9 il a trouv\u00e9 refuge.

It consists of substituting haptic stimuli, composed of a kinesthetic component and a skin deformation, with cutaneous stimuli only. The force generated can then be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic interaction, cutaneous and kinesthetic, and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this approach as sensory subtraction. Sensory subtraction aims at outperforming other non-kinesthetic feedback techniques in teleoperation (e.g., sensory substitution) while guaranteeing the stability and safety of the system. We tested the proposed approach in a challenging 7-DoF bimanual teleoperation task, similar to the Peg Board experiment of the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Sensory subtraction showed improved performance in terms of completion time, force exerted and total displacement of the rings with respect to two popular sensory substitution techniques. Moreover, it guaranteed a stable interaction in the presence of a communication delay in the haptic loop.\n\nPaper: http://sirslab.dii.unisi.it/papers/2014/Meli.TBME.2014.Haptics.Fin.pdf\n\nThanks to Fiamma Romagnoli.", "title": "Sensory Subtraction in Robot-Assisted Surgery: Cutaneous Feedback to Ensure Safety", "publishedDate": "2014-08-27T13:34:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "76Jb1GUaom4", "description": "Play-Doh Regenbogen Eis - Knetmasse - Knete\n\n\n\n\nSchlagw\u00f6rter:\nPlay-Doh Play Doh Playdo Playdough Playskool Barbie Disney Cars Princess Spongebob Emily Erdbeer Barby Lauras Stern Feuerwehrmann Sam TeleTubbies Clay Hasbro.

Premi Kandinsky 2007-20012. \n\nLa fundaci\u00f3 ArtChronika va ser creada i \u00e9s presidida per Shalva Breus, l'editor de la revista m\u00e9s important d'art en llengua russa, Artchronika, que t\u00e9 per objecte la promoci\u00f3 de l'art contemporani a R\u00fassia. Per assolir aquest prop\u00f2sit, el Premi Kandinsky va ser creat el 2007, i es considera un dels majors premis nacionals d'art contemporani de R\u00fassia. El premi s'ha convertit en tot un s\u00edmbol de les m\u00e9s significatives tend\u00e8ncies d'innovaci\u00f3 i perspectives sobre l'art. L'art rus avui necessita desenvolupar els contactes amb la resta del m\u00f3n, i el Premi Kandinsky fa molt per solucionar aquest problema mitjan\u00e7ant l'organitzaci\u00f3 d'exposicions a l'estranger. Les obres dels guanyadors i finalistes del Premi Kandinsky han estat exhibides amb gran \u00e8xit a Riga, Berl\u00edn i Londres.\nL'exposici\u00f3 est\u00e0 comissariada per Andrei Erofeev, un dels m\u00e9s destacats coneixedors de l'art rus contemporani i ex-conservador de la Galeria Nacional Tretiakov de Moscou, i Jean-Hubert Martin, ex-director del Centre Georges Pompidou i de la Kunsthalle de Berna.\nLa mostra inclou obres dels millors i m\u00e9s rellevants artistes contemporanis russos, seleccionats d'entre tots els participants del premi durant les seves cinc edicions.\n\nAquesta exposici\u00f3 \u00e9s un intent de sistematitzar aquestes obres i revelar els motius omnipresents i els temes i enfocaments repetits, des dels quals es pot tra\u00e7ar l'emerg\u00e8ncia d'una\"escola\"nacional de l'art.\n\nL'exposici\u00f3 es desplega en totes les plantes, a quatre espais, d'Arts Santa M\u00f2nica, a les seccions que han conceptualitzat els comissaris:\n\n\u00b7 Dimitri Prigov , l' \u00faltim conceptualista\n\u00b7 Caos material.

It is, however, generally agreed that, on December 16, 1916, having decided that Rasputin's influence over the Tsaritsa had made him a far-too-dangerous threat to the empire, a group of nobles, led by Prince Felix Yusupov and the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (one of the few Romanov family members to escape the annihilation of the family during the Red Terror), apparently lured Rasputin to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace, where they served him cakes and red wine laced with a massive amount of cyanide. According to legend, Rasputin was unaffected, although Vasily Maklakov had supplied enough poison to kill five men. Conversely, Maria's account asserts that, if her father did eat or drink poison, it was not in the cakes or wine, because, after the attack by Guseva, he had hyperacidity, and avoided anything with sugar. In fact, she expressed doubt that he was poisoned at all.\n\nDetermined to finish the job, Yusupov became anxious about the possibility that Rasputin might live until the morning, which would leave the conspirators with no time to conceal his body. Yusupov ran upstairs to consult the others and then came back down to shoot Rasputin through the back with a revolver. Rasputin fell, and the company left the palace for a while. Yusupov, who had left without a coat, decided to return to grab one, and, while at the palace, he went to check up on the body. Suddenly, Rasputin opened his eyes and lunged at Prince Yusupov. When he grabbed Prince Yusupov he ominously whispered in Yusupovs ear \"you bad boy\" and attempted to strangle him. As he made his bid to kill Yusupov, however, the other conspirators arrived and fired at him. After being hit three times in the back, Rasputin fell once more. As they neared his body, the party found that, remarkably, he was still alive, struggling to get up. They clubbed him into submission and, after wrapping his body in a sheet, threw him into an icy river, and he finally met his end there \u2014 as had both his siblings before him.\n\nThree days later, the body of Rasputin, poisoned, shot four times and badly beaten, was recovered from the Neva River. An autopsy established that the cause of death was hypothermia. His arms were found in an upright position, as if he had tried to claw his way out from under the ice. In the autopsy, it was found that he had indeed been poisoned, and that the poison alone should have been enough to kill him. Yet another report, also supporting the idea that he was still alive after submerging through the ice into the Neva River, is that after his body was pulled from the river, water was found in the lungs, showing that he didn't die until he was submerged", "title": "The Assassination of Grigori Rasputin", "publishedDate": "2008-11-17T17:21:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "76MtfCyPJc0", "description": "Acute Mind -  Misery\n\nWandering the world \nI saw you \nat the crossroads \nof my life. \n\nLate into the night\nI'm talking to you\nI pray for you\nIn my mind.\n\nWaiting for you in my dreams.\n\nEvery single day\nI look for you\nI need you \nin my life. \n\nIt's about time \nI'm standing at your door \nthe hallway is cold \nlike your heart. \n\nWaiting for you in my dreams.", "title": "Acute Mind -  Misery", "publishedDate": "2010-06-01T14:34:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "76N7S9NdaT8", "description": "Learn how to do caving turns on your snowboard. Carving is when you ride your snowboard edge around a turn, with your back foot following your front, leaving a clean line in the snow. Carving turns are used to keep you in control of your snowboard at high speeds, for doing quick snowboard turns and in the terrain park when you carve on the approach for a spin.  There are five snowboard skills that come together to complete a carving turn. Your stance, edging,  steering, pressure control, and adapting to terrain. Work on putting all these snowboard skills together to have a solid carving turn. If you have any question you can leave them in the comment section.

There is no apparent cause for these growths, which are usually between 1 and 3 mm in diameter, but their sudden appearance is often extremely concerning.  A surprising number of men are affected by these growths, with an estimate of around 20 percent developing the condition at some point during their lifetime.  However, the actual number could be higher than this, since it is highly unlikely that all cases are reported.  Many men choose to treat their pearly penile papules using natural methods, meaning that they will not see a doctor.\n\nThere are many natural remedies that can be used to reduce the symptoms and hopefully remove pearly penile papules completely.  Eucalyptus oil is just one of the many herbal treatments that you can try.  There are several varieties of eucalyptus oil, all originating from different species of the Australian plant.  You should look for one that is cineole-based, known frequently as oil of eucalyptus.  This has a wide range of medicinal uses, due to its antiseptic properties, and it has commonly been used in natural medicine as a method of preventing infection.\n\nApplying the eucalyptus oil is carried out in a very similar manner to all of the other natural treatments that can be used.  Wash the area thoroughly first, and make sure it is completely dry before you begin.  However, be gentle, especially when you are drying it, because you do not want to scratch the papules.  This could lead to the onset of infection and the development of scarring, even though you are using an antiseptic substance.  Scarring is likely to be even more unsightly than the papules themselves.\n\nUsing cotton wool, carefully dab the eucalyptus oil onto each papule, making sure that they are all coated properly.  This should ideally be done at night, so that the movements you make during the day will not cause the area to become sore.  You should let the oil dry before you cover it.  In the morning, wash off all traces of the oil.  You will need to repeat this daily for several weeks, and you should start to notice the papules gradually decreasing in number as they fall off.  All natural remedies take a while to start showing results, so it is important that you persevere with your chosen method.  However, if your skin starts to become irritated, you should choose a different remedy instead.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76SUKxiZbXo\n\nSearch Terms:\nhow to get rid of pearly penile papules\nhow to get rid of pearly penile papules at home\nget rid of pearly penile papules\nhow to get rid of pearly papules\nget rid of papules\npearly penile papules how to get rid of them\nhow do you get rid of papules\nhow to get rid of papules\ngetting rid of papules\nhow to get rid of spots\nhow to remove pearly papules\nhow to remove pearly penile papules\nsmall penile\nsmall hard bumps under skin on penile shaft", "title": "How To Get Rid of Pearly Penile Papules at Home | How To Get Rid of Papules", "publishedDate": "2014-02-08T23:55:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "76SWZwdtNKY", "description": "How to download the oracle 11g database", "title": "HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ORACLE 11G DATABASE", "publishedDate": "2012-04-12T08:06:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "76SlUJU4DeY", "description": "", "title": "HPM 300-ton Thermoset Molding Press", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T21:39:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "76Sy9Zb1jaU", "description": "There once was a baby who loved pizza. \n\nSo she ate it until it was gone. \n\nThe end. \n\nHaha okay, in all sensuousness... my daughter loves her food and this video just shows that all the more! :p", "title": "One Baby & Her Pizza", "publishedDate": "2012-01-17T18:24:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "76TBlLaedRY", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "usg guided axillary block", "publishedDate": "2013-02-22T01:39:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "76TN3wPTKcU", "description": "http://www.freemathvideos.com In this video series I show you how to evaluate trigonometric expressions by using trig identities and also co-function identities.

Hybridisation refers to the process in which two complementary pieces of DNA (or a piece of DNA and a piece of RNA) anneal to form a double-stranded molecule.\n\nThe piece of DNA or RNA used to detect complementary sequences is often called a probe. If the probe is labelled, for example by making it radioactive or fluorescent, then any pieces of DNA or RNA that it hybridises to will also be labelled and can be detected.\n\nBefore it can be used for hybridisation, a double-stranded DNA molecule must be separated into single-stranded DNA molecules, or denatured. Denaturing is usually achieved by heating the sample; when it is cooled, the resulting single-stranded molecules will hybridise to complementary molecules in the mixture, including those of the labelled probe.", "title": "DNA Test Methods - Hybridisation", "publishedDate": "2008-10-08T10:18:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "76ePuJc2Xmc", "description": "Follow my Instagram: @lachieforsythproductions\n\n\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ READ \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\nPromotional video for Otus Apparel.\nWebsite: http://www.otusapparel.bigcartel.com  Email:otusapparel@gmail.com \nInstagram: @otusapparel  Facebook: /otusapparel\n\nFollow David on Instagram - @david_olsen \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidolsenscooterpage\n\nSong - Frank Ocean - Forrest Gump\n\n\"I do not own the copyright to this song\"\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

But, engineer Liangfang Zhang had another idea. With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Zhang and his team at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), have created a nanosponge to combat drug-resistant infections, such as those caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n\nThe nanosponge, made from biocompatible, biodegradable polymer nanoparticles, is camouflaged with a red blood cell membrane. It circulates in the bloodstream, absorbing the toxins produced by infection. One red blood cell membrane can be used as a cloak for more than 3,000 of these stealthy nanosponges. Once the nanosponges are fully loaded with toxins, they are safely disposed of by the liver. They are designed to work with any type of infection or poison that attacks the cellular membrane.\n\nZhang is working closely with doctors and students at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center on this \"nano\" approach to tackling infections. He has been testing his approach on mice, with nearly a 100 percent success rate against staph infections. Human clinical trials are the next step! \n\nThe research in this episode was funded by NSF award #1216461, EAGER: Red Blood Cell Membrane Camouflaged Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery. \n\nMiles O'Brien, Science Nation Correspondent\nMarsha Walton, Science Nation Producer", "title": "Nanosponge decoy fights superbug infections - Science Nation", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T19:28:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "76tyDwZI6TU", "description": "Per me shume leksione www.worldacademy2013.com", "title": "Zarf katror prej letre", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T12:40:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "76uIADXG_KU", "description": "\u25ac\u25ba Mr.Rek ....", "title": "BUSY SIGNAL - JAMAICA LOVE ...
