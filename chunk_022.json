What If It Was Purple\n\nBlotter is yet another new hardcore punk band to come out of Austin featuring members of Glue, Breakout, Creamers, and the singer of Wiccans on drums. Do his drums sound like DDDDUUUURRRRR? Yes, yes they do.\n\nThey're definitely my favorite band to come out of this younger crowd of Austin kids. Catchy, punky hardcore is the name of the game here. Nothing fancy, but it's still very engaging and will have you raging, in theory. What also sets them apart is their detached-yet-evolved vocal delivery/lyrical content of the band. I love it. It's no coincidence that there is more than one way in which the singer almost IS Bill Murray in Stripes.\n\nNot sure what's happened down in Austin, but it seems as if the younger, excluded crowd of late teens/early twenties kids have buckled down and graduated from moshing beers out of garage rockers' hands to starting a shit ton of new bands. I don't like every band in this crowd, but that doesn't even matter when it's quite inspiring to think that they've all gotten their shit together enough to create a new scene out of seemingly nothing. I'd say the best way to follow this crowd and their bands would be to check out the False Form blogspot, which seems to be putting out tape releases of everything at a furious pace.\n\nhttp://icoulddietomorrow.blogspot.gr/", "title": "Blotter - What If It Was Purple", "publishedDate": "2013-04-20T18:52:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KTqeGq4UNg", "description": "1999, programa S\u00e9ptimo de Caballer\u00eda, emitido por Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola;  dirigido y presentado por Miguel Bos\u00e9.", "title": "Montserrat Caball\u00e9 y Montserrat Mart\u00ed - Duetto Buffo Di Due Gatti", "publishedDate": "2011-06-28T21:09:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KTr8Cj_7lo", "description": "M\u00fasica \"Quem ama espera\" no Via Show/ Rio de Janeiro - 2011\n\nwww.bandadopa.com.br\n(11)7817-3239", "title": "Banda DOPA - Quem ama espera (ao vivo no Via Show)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T21:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KU-WObT00k", "description": "", "title": "Akhil Vishwa Jai ShreeRam Gau-Sanvardhan  Kendra Nanus Valpoi Sattari Goa", "publishedDate": "2011-09-08T10:27:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KU8jbXU77g", "description": "Das Crazy Washhouse liegt neben dem Wellenflug und dem Mystery Warehouse in der Westernstadt des Parks.

The 'dead disco' is intended to be anywhere, be it a hall, a gym, a church or simply memory of your first intermediate school dance. As the silhouetted band play as a back drop to beautiful but ghoulish dances, the driving bass and drums of this song create haunting but danceable arrangement of visuals and sound. The song \"Dance Dark at the Dead Disco\" in itself seems to be a homage to grinding zombie flicks and that desolate memory of vacant halls when everyone's gone. While this video references the cliche, it does so in a slightly ironic manner; remaining genuine enough to convey the dark tonality of the song and in Graveyard Love's music.\n\nDirected by Evan Howell & Alec Hutchinson\nProduced by Hamish Black\nDOP Evan Howell\nChoreography by Tallulah Holly-Massey", "title": "Graveyard Love - Dance Dark at the Dead Disco", "publishedDate": "2013-06-18T11:23:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KUTfgWvHTM", "description": "Hi everyone!

Then welcome to the club.\n\nMillions of people are suffering from this skin condition. Urticaria also known as hives are red and bumpy rashes usually triggered because of an allergic reaction.\n\nTypes and Causes of Urticaria\n\nThere are two types of urticaria; acute and chronic. The former usually goes away after a couple of hours but can last up to six weeks. Chronic urticaria is an outbreak that lasts longer than 6 weeks.\n\nCertain foods such as milk, eggs, wheat, nuts as well as food additives and preservatives are usual culprits that lead to acute hives. Some medications and insect bites can also cause a reaction wherein histamine (a chemical produced by our own bodies) is released into the blood vessels of the skin causing an outbreak of hives.\n\nTaking NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), aspirin and painkillers like codeine can also cause a person to develop hives. Physical activity, poor health, change in temperature and even stress are also known triggers of acute urticaria.\n\nChronic Urticaria\n\nAs for chronic urticaria it can be more difficult to find the causes since it seldom due to an allergic reaction. The majority of people who are suffering from chronic hives do not know what is causing their outbreaks. Causes however can be malignancies, hormonal imbalance or viral infections with about 30 to 40 percent of these sufferers having an autoimmune disorder.\n\nUrticaria Treatment\n\nThe purpose of urticaria relief is to lessen the symptoms so that you can get on with your normal everyday life free from discomfort since the rash itself typically vanishes on its own.\n\nThe most common urticaria treatments used to ease the itchy, stinging and burning sensation are ointments and topical creams. You don't need a prescription for it and they can be bought at your local pharmacy.\n\nAntihistamine such as Benadryl, Zyrtec and Claritin are the most frequently used urticaria relief medications. These can also be bought over the counter with no prescription required.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with chronic hives you may need to undergo a treatment plan. It is also recommended that you take prescription antihistamines, along with H2 blockers. Oral steroids like prednisone can be used to treat your hives outbreak but only for a short period of time as long-term use can pose some health risks.\n\nImmunosuppressant,s UV radiation and antifungal antibiotics may be considered as well however these urticaria treatment plans are uncommon.\n\nhomeopathic treatment of urticaria\nhives natural remedies\nhives homeopathic treatment\nurticaria hives treatment\nnatural cures for chronic hives\nherbal remedies for urticaria\nhives cures natural\ncure for urticaria hives\nnatural remedy for hives\nchronic hives natural treatment\nurticaria hives cure\nchronic urticaria angioedema\nhives treatment natural remedies\nnatural hive remedies\nurticaria natural remedy\nchronic urticaria treatment natural\nurticaria herbal treatment\nremedies for urticaria\nidiopathic urticaria and angioedema\nhomeopathic cure for", "title": "How To Get A Natural Urticaria Treatment To Find True Urticaria Relief", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T15:33:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Kc_3yemAbE", "description": "Panda e Os Caricas performing Boa Noite, Descansem Bem.

With their high productivity and unmatched numbering quality, it is no surprise that Morgana numbering machines can make a great impression on your profitability.\n\nThe FSN rotary numbering machine is ideal for the small inplant, instant or commercial printer. With a production speed of 72,000 impressions per hour when using 8 heads.\n\nThe FSN features quality numbering and the ability to feed up to 17.9\" x 17.9\" sheets.\n\nThe FSN has a powerful suction feeder which will feed a wide range of paper weights.\n\nPositive control of the paper from feed to delivery ensures unmatched and consistent register of numbering action.The suction feed system uses electronic pulsing, while feeding from the bottom of the stack allows loading on the run for non-stop production.\n\nOur standard inking system uses a micro porous ink roller. This transfers ink onto a forme roller to give clean consistent inking of the numbering heads. Ink rollers are available in black and red.\n\nThe FSN control panel allows for fast simple operation with make ready from job to job is accomplished in seconds.\n\nSlitting perforators give flat perforating on a wide range of stocks.

Charles Darwin was among the first scientists to dabble in plant hormone research. In his book \"The Power of Movement in Plants\" presented in 1880, he first describes the effects of light on movement of canary grass (Phalaris canariensis) coleoptiles. The coleoptile is a specialized leaf originating from the first node which sheaths the epicotyl in the plants seedling stage protecting it until it emerges from the ground. When unidirectional light shines on the coleoptile, it bends in the direction of the light. If the tip of the coleoptile was covered with aluminum foil, no bending would occur towards the unidirectional light. However if the tip of the coleoptile was left uncovered but the portion just below the tip was covered, exposure to unidirectional light resulted in curvature toward the light. Darwin's experiment suggested that the tip of the coleoptile was the tissue responsible for perceiving the light and producing some signal which was transported to the lower part of the coleoptile where the physiological response of bending occurred. He then cut off the tip of the coleoptile and exposed the rest of the coleoptile to unidirectional light to see if curving occurred. Curvature did not occur confirming the results of his first experiment (Darwin, 1880). \nIt was in 1885 that Salkowski discovered indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in fermentation media (Salkowski, 1885). The isolation of the same product from plant tissues would not be found in plant tissues for almost 50 years. IAA is the major auxin involved in many of the physiological processes in plants (Arteca, 1996). In 1907, Fitting studied the effect of making incisions on either the light or dark side of the plant. His results were aimed at understanding if translocation of the signal occurred on a particular side of the plant but his results were inconclusive because the signal was capable of crossing or going around the incision (Fitting, 1907). In 1913, Boysen-Jensen modified Fritting's experiment by inserting pieces of mica to block the transport of the signal and showed that transport of auxin toward the base occurs on the dark side of the plant as opposed to the side exposed to the unidirectional light (Boysen-Jensen, 1913). In 1918, Paal confirmed Boysen-Jensen's results by cutting off coleoptile tips in the dark, exposing only the tips to the light, replacing the coleoptile tips on the plant but off centered to one side or the other. Results showed that whichever side was exposed to the coleoptile, curvature occurred toward the other side (Paal, 1918). Soding was the next scientist to extend auxin research by extending on Paal's idea. He showed that if tips were cut off there was a reduction in growth but if they were cut off and then replaced growth continued to occur (Soding, 1925).", "title": "AUXINS EXPERIMENT VIDEO!!!!!! ft.

This incorporates the sale of enzyme supplements that are enzymes which contain plant based enzymes. This contains the enzymes protease, lipase, cellulase lipase and amylase. This kind of enzyme products can be grown in a laboratory on plants like barley or soy plants. \n\nEnzymes are defined as any complex chemical substance that is produced by cells that are living and is a biochemical catalyst. So in most cases a customer would certainly look to online websites for these enzymes or enzyme supplements. Buying Enzyme Products Before somebody purchases enzyme supplements they have to find out what the body necessities are. \n\nFor example one typical enzyme deficiency is lactose intolerance. As a man or woman grows and grows most persons start producing less of the enzyme lactase which is the enzyme that truly digests lactose. Lactase tablets could aid or lactase drops could be bought in drop form to put on food. This is certainly one example where enzyme providers can certainly market enzyme supplements for sale. The entire body produces many enzymes however the enzyme business is a booming one particularly on this time of healthier eating and much more natural ingredients and supplements.\n\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/blog/\nhttp://www.takebackyourhealth.com/articles.html", "title": "The Sale Of Enzymes By Enzymes Suppliers Markets Part 1", "publishedDate": "2012-02-10T07:03:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0LFbAF_Y3Yo", "description": "This is Mikes 120 gallon aquarium .

With a spirit of athleticism in the air, a graphic fusion of clean shapes and sporty sleekness pushes accessories across the finish line. Put spring into your step and make a dynamic statement with casual elegance in fresh colors of pastel shades or a cheery palette of exuberant hues. This season, the roaring twenties roared again; striking geometric lines and refined art deco motifs revive the glamorous sophistication of the Jazz age.\n\nStay ahead of the sports game this year with high performance inspired New Athlete Collection. Jam-packed with great mesh and micro perforation, sporty and sexy are an investment-worthy option and bring a well-appointed twist to the season's athletic look. Neon hues, black, navy, silver and grey champion the collection in pointy flat pumps, sandals, wedges, oxfords and slip-on platform block heels accompanied with large totes and small cross-body bags.\n\nThe Cottage Collection is drenched in the palest of washes for spring. Springtime's spectrum of pastel shades and wallpaper floral prints come together to stimulate a cotton-candy garden in full bloom. This was all set to the feel-good moment of the season in linen ballet flats, straw sandals, cork wedges, patent pumps, canvas totes, hobos and clutches.\n\nGo Minimal Bold in a display of colours on classic styles. Take your cue from the catwalks with a cheery palette of exuberant hues and follow Spring's theory to go bold and bright. Beat Monday blues with a burst of sunshine yellow, electric blue or jade mint in whichever style suits you best -- open toe sandals, pumps, low heels or ballerinas and structured bags or wallets.\n\nArt Deco draws inspiration from the arts and echo architectural icons with striking geometric lines and refined motifs. Supply high-octane glamour with a palette of emerald, burgundy and gold, worked to perfection. Revive the sophistication of the 1920's Jazz Age and create style with elongated silhouettes, clean angular lines and blocks of bold colour in open, peep toe heels and structured bags.\n\nProduct collection:\nFootwear: Pump heels, ballerinas, oxford heels, wedges, loafers, flats, moccasin, heels, sandals\nBag: Structured bags, sling bags, totes, hobos, hard clutches, handbags, wallets\nBelts: Standard, skinny and thin low, mid and high-waist belts\nEyewear: Aviators and frames\nBracelet: Steel Alloy and leather bracelets", "title": "Charles & Keith Spring 2013 previewed in Dubai", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T16:50:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0LUtbQKNLMg", "description": "G\u0435t a gr\u0435at d\u0435al \u043en \u0430maz\u043en.\u0441\u043em http://bit.ly/SB2tRM  \n\nLenovo Lephone S890\n1.

It appears a shiny, dark grey, silver colored metal. It's also extremely strong and resilient to many different types of external forces which may cause other metals to scratch. \n\nThe main pro of a tungsten carbide ring is that it's durable and very strong. Many different metals, especially that of the ubiquitous gold wedding bang, often show signs of strong wear after a couple of years. Gold easily scratches from daily use, and many customers are often obligated to send their rings in for maintenance every few years -- which can cost a lot of money. This, is rarely the case with tungsten carbide as it's an extremely strong metal which hardly shows any wear even after years. \n\nAnother very important benefit about the tungsten carbide ring is that it's very affordable. Gold, platinum wedding bands may cost even up to the thousands for the bride and groom, however tungsten carbide rings only cost a fraction of that. A good quality tungsten carbide ring will set someone back around two hundred dollars. Leading to massive savings, even in the long term -- as mentioned above, there is usually no need for a tungsten carbide ring to be maintained every few years.\n\nTungsten rings cannot be re-sized as in the case of rings made of other metals. So, if you put on weight or may be lose some, you cannot get your ring size adjusted. However, there are many jewelers who give a lifetime guarantee when they sell tungsten rings. Due to this guarantee, you can get your ring replaced due to the problem of size, for free. Hence, while making your purchase, ask questions regarding this to your jeweler.", "title": "Tungsten Carbide Rings Pros and Cons", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T17:53:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Lk5Q7m-jeM", "description": "My personal best time on this track and current 11\u00ba on the cup (Android leaderboard).\nI made this time this morning, but I couldn't upload it then...\nIt was a nice lap, but even better time is possible getting more havoc city on tunnel and making a barrel roll at 1:18.

You can get more info here: http://migrationology.com/2013/11/chips-mayai-french-fries-omelet-a-staple-of-tanzanian-junk-food/\n\nAs the name suggests, chips mayai (also sometimes known as chipsi mayai) is the basic combination of fresh chips or French fries wrapped into an egg omelet and fried in lots of oil. If you're ever in Tanzania and notice a big black wok sitting outside a restaurant with a fire underneath it and bubbling oil frying chips, you can be certain they serve this classic dish. To make chips mayai, the French fries are first fried. Normally the potatoes of cut in quite large pieces, and then fried until a golden yellow in color. East African style chips are not overly crispy, they are a little on the soggy side, and that's the reason why chips mayai works so well.\n\nSo after the French fries or chips are finished cooking, they are thrown into a frying pan, and a couple of eggs are thrown on top. The result is the ultimate omelet that's hearty and very unhealthy, but it definitely tastes pretty decent. For this particular food video, I (Mark Wiens), was in Dar Es Salaam, and stopped at a small street food restaurant stall in the Upanga neighborhood. Feeling a little bit hungry, I decided to just order chips mayai. It just took a few moments, and my plate was delivered to me in all its glory. The Tanzanian omelet came served with a  pile of salt on the side and also some fresh chilies. Also, the dish wouldn't be complete without a good dousing of East African style tomato sauce, which is similar to ketchup but a little more transparent and a little sweeter. Overall, chips mayai is a little on the plain side, but it tastes a lot better when it's combined with the chilies, and covered in the tangy tomato sauce.\n\nChips mayai is not my overall favorite food in the world, and it's far from being even close to a healthy snack, but it is one of the comfort Tanzanian foods and it's widely available anywhere you travel in the country. \n\nFollow my food adventures at http://migrationology.com/ & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ & http://travelbyying.com/\nBangkok 101 Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-things-to-do-in-bangkok/\nThai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/\n\nThank you so much for watching this food and travel video by Mark Wiens.

Armin van Buuren is one of them. Through his 'Universal Religion' series, he's captured the summer since 2004, landing a mix compilation that burst with exclusive highlights. In 2012, he lands the 6th Chapter of 'Universal Religion', recorded live during the A State of Trance Night at the world-famous Club Privilege.\n\n2012 has already proven to be a significant year in the career of the Dutchman. The producer/DJ, relentlessly driven by his perfectionism, celebrated the 550th episode and 11th birthday of his A State of Trance radio show, with 6 events in 5 different countries. Each of the events were broadcast live, uniting millions of listeners around the globe, sharing their passion for music. The next, logical step was taking his Ibiza residency to a higher level. Armin van Buuren landed his A State of Trance night at the biggest European club: Privilege. Serving its 10,000 strong crowd a show of outstanding quality with a star-studded line-up, the A State of Trance Ibiza Invasion has spread far beyond the regions of the Balearic sea.\n\nRecorded live in the summer of 2012, 'Universal Religion Chapter 6' makes you part of these special happenings with two live recordings. It makes you feel the energy of the crowd, lets you hear their screams for more, as well as bringing you a selection of exclusive and custom-made tunes and remixes by some of the world's most talented producers. Tracks by Protoculture, Orjan Nilsen, Aly & Fila, Jorn van Deynhoven, A.R.D.I., Solarstone and many more. Including the brand new Armin single, 'I'll Listen' and many other premieres, 'Universal Religion Chapter 6' is the timeless musical memory of 2012's summer season.\n\nCD1\n01 Andrew Rayel feat.

With the existing health risk at these standards and industry resistance due to the feasibility of lowering these standards, we explore the idea of using genetic testing in the workplace as an alternative to lowering the current PEL. The existence of polymorphisms in genes involved in benzene metabolism may make certain workers more susceptible to developing leukemia through benzene exposure, and therefore possible candidates for genetic screening. Some drawbacks to this approach include possible genetic discrimination, a shift of responsibility in occupational safety from employers to workers, as well as cost and proper counseling/handling of the results. In the case of benzene, the number of polymorphisms involved and the complicated nature of their effects on benzene metabolism, paired with the high prevalence of these polymorphisms in the population add even more challenges.\n\nEuropean Environment Agency.

The island, 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, lies about 145 kilometres (90 mi) south of Cuba, and 191 kilometres (119 mi) west of Hispaniola, the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Jamaica is the fifth-largest island country in the Caribbean. The indigenous people, the Ta\u00edno, called it Xaymaca in Arawakan, meaning the \"Land of Wood and Water\" or the \"Land of Springs\".\n\nOnce a Spanish possession known as Santiago, in 1655 it came under the rule of England (later Great Britain), and was called Jamaica. It achieved full independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962. With 2.8 million people, it is the third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. Kingston is the country's largest city and its capital, with a population of 937,700. Jamaica has a large diaspora around the world, due to emigration from the country.\n\nJamaica is a Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth II as Queen of Jamaica and head of state. Her appointed representative in the country is the Governor-General of Jamaica, currently Sir Patrick Allen. The head of government and Prime Minister of Jamaica is Portia Simpson-Miller. Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with legislative power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.", "title": "Jamaica - Usain Bolt - Once you go you know - TV Tourism Commercial - TV Spot - The Travel Channel", "publishedDate": "2013-09-02T14:44:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0M3aAStmjP0", "description": "Wordt je Rhododendron te groot of kleuren de bladeren geel?

Nurse Jenny Lee (Jessica Raine) has hung up her forceps and departed Call the Midwife (BBC One). One of the BBC's most closely guarded secrets in years was revealed in the rather downbeat, but nicely achieved, closing moments of the final episode of the current series, doubtless leaving legions of the 1950s Poplar-based series' 10 million or so fans reeling from shock.\n\nTo be fair, news-addicted fans would have known since early morning, when the story broke that this was to be Raine's last appearance. (She's off to try her luck in Hollywood.) Only the manner of her departure was at issue, and it came at the end of an affecting episode in which birth and death were placed in constant opposition to one another.\n\nNot only was Jenny confronted with a series of Herculean labours, but that other favourite Midwife character Chummy (Miranda Hart) was having an emotionally excoriating time coping with the death of her cold-as-ice mother, Lady Brown (Cheryl Campbell), from cancer. Tears flowed by the bucketful.\n\nFinding her vocation for midwifery waning, Jenny's interest in the newly founded hospice movement bloomed and she was increasingly convinced that everyone deserves a good death as well as a good birth. So she handed in her notice.\n\nOf course, she had found a handsome new beau to run off with. A little soon after the death of her last boyfriend just three weeks ago, but this new chap's surname was Worth. Keen-eared Midwife fans will have spotted the link to Jennifer Worth (n\u00e9e Lee) author of the original books. \n\nI created this video with the YouTube Slideshow Creator (http://www.youtube.com/upload)", "title": "Call the Midwife, series 3, the final episode, review", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T16:18:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0M73at_iOhI", "description": "In the test kitchen of Noma, the celebrated chef and his pastry chef, Rosio S\u00e1nchez, demonstrate the difficulties of making the Mexican staple.\n\nProduced by: Andreas Koefoed\n\nRead the story here: http://nyti.ms/Zh4eY4\n\nSubscribe to the Times Video newsletter for free and get a handpicked selection of the best videos from The New York Times every week: http://bit.ly/timesvideonewsletter\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\n\nWatch more videos at: http://nytimes.com/video\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more from The New York Times?\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nytvideo\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nytimes\n\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+nytimes/\n\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Two representations of the data exist simultaneously at two different scales, providing an alternative to classical pan & zoom for navigating multi-scale interfaces. For many practical applications however, the magnification range of focus+context  techniques is too limited. This paper addresses this limitation by exploring the quantization problem: the mismatch between visual and motor precision in the magnified region. We introduce three new interaction techniques that solve this problem by integrating fast navigation and high-precision interaction in the magnified region. Speed couples precision to navigation speed. Key and Ring use a discrete switch between precision levels, the former using a keyboard modifier, the latter by decoupling the cursor from the lens' center. We report on three experiments showing that our techniques make interacting with lenses easier while increasing the range of practical magnification factors, and that performance can be further improved by integrating speed-dependent visual behaviors.", "title": "High-Precision Magnification Lenses", "publishedDate": "2010-03-05T10:18:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MVBmjWJLf0", "description": "No copyright infringement intended\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/kuntandthegang\nwww.kuntandthegang.co.uk", "title": "Wank Fantasy - Kunt And The Gang", "publishedDate": "2012-02-08T01:19:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MVDupyC8aw", "description": "punkbirders scoring heavily.", "title": "Azure Tit", "publishedDate": "2007-01-17T15:14:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MViyJNCV8c", "description": "From the album \"Life Is Talkin' Misery\" released in 2009", "title": "MoOt - It's A Beautiful Day", "publishedDate": "2013-01-07T09:15:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MW2595_u6c", "description": "Leave a LIKE/FAV for some AW!

Trumpetfish can be a bit more than 36 inches (3 ft) long and have greatly elongated bodies with small jaws at the front end of a long, tubular snout. The gills are pectinate, resembling the teeth of a comb, and a soft dorsal fin is found near the tail fin. A series of spines occurs in front of the dorsal fin. Trumpetfish vary in color from dark brown to greenish but also yellow in some areas. A black streak, sometimes reduced to a dark spot, occurs along the jaw, and a pair of dark spots is sometimes found on the base of the tail fin.\nTrumpetfish swim slowly, sneaking up on unsuspecting prey, or lying motionless like a floating stick, swaying back and forth with the wave action of the water. They are adept at camouflaging themselves and often swim in alignment with other larger fishes. They feed almost exclusively on small fish, such as wrasses and atheriniformes,by sucking them suddenly into their small mouths.\n\n\nTrumpetfish at Molasses Reef, Florida Keys\n\n\nCornetfish (a close relative often mistaken for a trumpetfish) in Kona, Hawaii.

From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami.\n\"I don't know how to describe what I saw. It's horrific.\"\nMost of the dead are understood to have drowned or were crushed by collapsed buildings. Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and in the roads.\n\"On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,\" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.\n\"They were covered with just anything - tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,\" she said. Asked how many, she said, \"Well over 100 where we passed.\"\nBut the destruction extended well beyond Tacloban, a city of 200,000.

Be sure to keep sanding until there is no jagged edges or cuts in the surface of your wheel.\n\nTake your scuff pad and scuff all wheel surfaces, six inches in every direction from the repair area.\n\nMask off the surrounding area with butcher paper or newspaper to protect your tire and other parts of your car from paint overspray.\n\nShake your can of primer for 60 seconds. Test your spray patter on your masking paper and apply 3-4 really light coats. Try not to get any primer in areas that you did not sand.\n\nNonetheless I managed to get a little primer too far beyond the repair here. I'll just use my scuff pad to sand it out.\n\nTake a small square of your black, fine-grit sandpaper and using really light pressure sand down any bumpy spots in your primer.\n\nBe sure to wipe away any dust that settles in the spokes of the wheel.\n\nShake up your silver paint bottle for about 20 seconds, insert the aerosol sprayer, and test your spray pattern against your masking paper.\n\nPut a couple light coats on your wheel to see if pure silver is going to be a color match. If you do not see a match, you can always add a little black, give it a shake, and try again. I should note that 9 out of 10 can be painted with pure silver, no need for tinting.\n\nNow that I've got a good color match, I'll just look at the wheel from a few more angles and make sure to mist on a little bit of silver to blend in the repair. \nRemove the air sprayer from the bottle, wipe the straw clean, and clear the nozzle so that we can use it later on other wheels.\n\nIf you get a little bit of paint in places you didn't want to, like maybe you didn't mask off the tires or lugnuts, you can wipe those areas clean at this time with a little bit of paint thinner or nail polish remover works fine, too.\n\nShake your clearcoat can for about 60 seconds, and apply two light coats over all the areas that you laid down silver paint.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later your clearcoat should be cured up, and you remove the paper and enjoy the sight of a freshly restored wheel.\n\nI should note that his wheel was actually a medium silver, but I still used pure bright silver to repair it, because I sprayed about six inches beyond the scratch and feathered in the paint, the repair is imperceptible. \n\nSo. in about half an hour we've gone from curb damages like this and achieved this result with the wheel wizard repair system.", "title": "Alloy Wheel Repair Kit: Demonstration", "publishedDate": "2014-05-28T18:49:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MkyQJmAW58", "description": "Bees pollinating Sedum Stonecrop on a beautiful June day.

They are most notable for their red, yellow to white, and black colored banding. Coral snakes are native to North America such as the eastern or common coral snake, the Texas coral snake and the Arizona coral snake, found in the southern and western United States. Coral snakes can be found in other parts of the world which can have distinctly different patterns. Most species of coral snake are small in size. The North American species average around 3 feet (91\u00a0cm) in length, but specimens of up to 5 feet (150\u00a0cm) or slightly larger have been reported. Aquatic species have flattened tails acting as a fin, aiding in swimming. Coral snakes vary widely in their behavior, but most are very elusive, fossorial snakes which spend the vast majority of their time buried beneath the ground or in the leaf litter of a rainforest floor, only coming to the surface while raining or during breeding season. \nLike all elapid snakes, coral snakes use a pair of small fangs fixed in the front of their top jaw to deliver their venom. They feed on smaller snakes, frogs, lizards, nestling birds and young rodents.  Coral snakes have a tendency to hold on to a victim when biting, unlike vipers which have retractable fangs and tend to prefer to strike and let go immediately. Coral snakes are not aggressive or prone to biting however, and account for less than one percent of the number of snake bites each year in the United States. Coral Snakes were filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in Florida in 2013.", "title": "Coral Snakes 07  Music", "publishedDate": "2013-05-23T20:12:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MxfC1NR9A4", "description": "http://bit.ly/IonicDetoxFootSpa - For pictures of Ionic Detox Foot Bath results.\n\nDetoxification through the ionic detox foot bath is a valid way of maintaining good health. From this process, the toxins in the body gotten from food, air and water, are eliminated. These toxins are excreted through bowel movement and sweating. Bowel movements, if not done regularly, can be induced by different colon cleansing procedures. Sweating on the other hand is done by exercise and body movement. However, just like bowel movement, sweating can also be stimulated either by sauna or foot bath.\n\nToday, the ionic detox foot bath has opened its doors to help in the health maintenance of many different types of individuals. We do not just use our feet for walking, running, skipping and the like. The invention of foot detox spa is now an inducement for sweating, which augments the process of toxin elimination.\n\nWhat is ionic foot detox?\n\nThis is actually a process of soaking the feet in a foot spa in which the water has been electrically charged. This process can improve the microcirculation of the blood with the end view of re-balancing the body's electrical system. Foot detox helps eliminate the toxins in our body by sweating them out.\n\nIonic detox procedure\n\nThe ionic detox foot bath resembles any other spa. The ionic detox works for the person's health in many ways. It is a new technology for the creation of positive and negative ions to re-energize and revitalize the body system. During the procedure of ionic detoxification, the foot bath transmits titillating currents throughout the entire body and at this time the positive ions are released. The concentration of ions thus released neutralizes the wastes and toxins and bring them to the pores of the feet from where they can be eliminated. Thirty minutes soaking can complete this helpful detox procedure.\n\nIt is a fact that detoxification is very beneficial in the holistic health of a person as wastes and poisonous toxins are eliminated from the body. This is good for both adults and children, the ionic detox foot bath is offered in many health salons and spas.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/IonicDetoxFootSpa - For pictures of Ionic Detox Foot Bath results.", "title": "Ionic Detox Foot Bath Review and Results", "publishedDate": "2012-12-23T03:33:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0My4gaVPHyI", "description": "asl gum story", "title": "the gum story", "publishedDate": "2009-02-06T02:44:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MyWNLvDudM", "description": "Catch the latest scintillating cosmic-shoegaze album from Glaze of Cathexis \nWe spared no expense to psychically rock you as hard as we can!! \n\nWe are Glaze of Cathexis .  \nCheck us out at \nhttp://glazeofcathexis.bandcamp.com/", "title": "GLAZE of CATHEXIS and their astral gramophone radio campaign", "publishedDate": "2014-06-21T13:24:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "0MyzdVGQXkg", "description": "http://www.ultimatehandyman.co.uk/ shows you how to tap a hole using a cordless drill and a taper tap.

They have long bodies with muscular tails, and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate.[2] Commercially important species include two species of Homarus from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi -- the northern-hemisphere genus Nephrops and the southern-hemisphere genus Metanephrops. Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word \"lobster\" in their names, the unqualified term \"lobster\" generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae. Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters. The closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.

Album e canzone si chiamano \"Curre curre guagli\u00f2\" e a cantarlo era un combo napoletano che da l\u00ec spicc\u00f2 il volo imprimendo le proprie parole nel mondo della musica mondiale: i 99 Posse. Quell'album vinse il Tenco come miglior album in dialetto e la canzone omonima fu scelta da Salvadores per il suo \"Sud\".\n\nA 21 anni di distanza quelle parole e quell'album sono ancora attuali e raccontano la protesta contro il potere costituito, riuscendo anche, paradossalmente, ad istituzionalizzarsi e finire nei libri di scuola con quelle parole di protesta cantate ininterrottamente da quell'anno. Un album che parlava a chi non accettava le cose come stavano, contro il razzismo, le autorit\u00e0 violente, il fascismo di ritorno.\n\nPer festeggiare quell'album, il 25 marzo ne uscir\u00e0 il secondo capitolo, \"Curre curre guagli\u00f2 2.0 - Non un passo indietro\", ovvero una versione rieditata a cui hanno collaborato alcune tra le migliori forze del panorama musicale italiano. Quattordici brani, ma 18 pezzi in una playlist che vede alcune canzone cantate pi\u00f9 di una volta da musicisti diversi. \"Curre curre guagli\u00f2\", \"'O doumento\", \"Ripetutamente\", \"Rigurgito antifascista\" sono solo alcune delle canzoni che facevano parte di quell'album; Alborosie, Mama Marjas, Caparezza, J-Ax, Clementino, Pau (Negrita), Punkreas, Samuel (Subsonica), Banda Bassotti, Francesco Di Bella (24 Grana), Ensi, Signor K e Bonnot, Valerio Jovine, Enzo Avitabile e i Bottari, Roy Paci, invece, sono alcuni dei feat. che troverete. Ognuno di loro rilegge a modo suo la canzone assegnata, che sono state rinominate vestendosi anche di nuovi abiti: rap, rock, elettronico o funky.\n\nQuesta attesa riedizione \u00e8 stata anticipata gi\u00e0 da un paio di teaser e da oggi potete guardare l'ultimo, in esclusiva su Fanpage e YouMedia, che vede protagonista il musicista/comico napoletano Gino Fastidio (che molti conosceranno per la partecipazione a \"Made in Sud\") ed \u00e8 girato dai The Jackal, il gruppo di videomaker partenopei protagonisti di lavori come \"The Parker\", \"Lost in Google\" e gi\u00e0 collaboratori della band per cui hanno girato il video di \"Tarantelle pe' camp\u00e0\", singolo tratto dal precedente album dei 99 Posse \"Cattivi Guagliuni\".\n\n\"Non un passo indietro, rispetto a quello che siamo, che facciamo e che rappresentiamo. Non solo un altro mondo \u00e8 possibile, ma anche un'altra strada in questo mondo, nel frattempo, \u00e8 praticabile... E la nostra longevit\u00e0 ne \u00e8 la dimostrazione. \u00c8 nella direzione del fare comunit\u00e0, che poi \u00e8 la sintesi di ci\u00f2 che facciamo da sempre, che abbiamo pensato questa rilettura di Curre curre guaglio', invitando decine di vecchi amici, e scoprendone di nuovi, giovani ed ormai diversamente giovani estimatori che, per i motivi pi\u00f9 disparati, si sentono legati a quel disco e al periodo di cui \u00e8 diventato, suo malgrado, simbolo; circa 40 musicisti, tra cantanti e gruppi musicali, a rinfrescare le sempre attuali rime storiche, arricchendole di nuovi punti di vista, e naturalmente di nuove \"contraddizioni\". Abbiamo voluto concentrarci su ci\u00f2 che ci unisce, Curre curre guaglio', ignorando tutto ci\u00f2 che potrebbe allontanarci, ed \u00e8 venuto fuori questo disco, che, detto tra noi, non \u00e8 niente male\" firmato 'O Zul\u00f9.\n\nIn esclusiva per Fanpage ecco la Tracklist completa con tutte le collaborazioni\n\n1234 feat.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

However, curiosity got the better of him and he headed outside to find the cashew tree's trunk snapped in half by a mysterious metal sphere lying in a hole nearby.\n\nSome 20 villagers joined Mendes to help him extract the object from the ground and examine it. Mendes says the sphere is hollow and if shaken some sort of liquid can be felt swishing inside. Locals quickly spread the news, as they reached the town of Mata Roma over 2,000 people flocked to see the \"UFO\".\n\n\"It was a huge uproar here. Some feared it was the beginning of the 2012 end of the world, others said it was 'alien', but I think it is a piece of satellite,\" said Max Garreto Mauro, 25, a resident of Mata Roma.\n\nPeter Costa, the meteorologist at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), agrees with Garetto, saying the object would probably be part of a satellite. \"I'm sure this is not a weather balloon or part of it,\" he said as quoted by O Imparcia.\n\nMilitary police confiscated the sphere and took it to the barracks in the nearby Mata Roma. They have not specified what the UFO's possible future will be.

The fit is crucial. Your hand must be relaxed. At the same time, it must be properly sized and measured in order to be able to throw the ball the proper way and create the dynamic that you want to for your purpose. Everyone has a different size, shape, flexibility, and strength. And it makes a big difference on how the ball is fitted in order to perform properly. You have fingertip. You have conventional. \n\nYou have fingertip. Each one will fit a different purpose, and also a different type of hand. A person that has a large hand, a small hand, or thin, or a little bit larger, it's going to make a big difference in how you fit. Also, we have different fitting techniques to help you perform also, be it the pitch, the span, and also the accessories that you can use to help you feel comfortable throwing the ball. It's very important to have the person fit not only the size but also the flexibility, the person's flexibility of their fingers, their thumb. You want to make sure it's comfortable. At the same time, you're not going to get caught up in the ball, because you are going to swell. And you may shrink, depending on the weather and depending on the person's body. \n\nAlso you have to make sure that when you do fit somebody, you should be able to be relaxed and not be struggling to hold onto the ball. You want it to be snug, but at the same time you want it to be loose enough to come off and also let the ball down the lane the proper way. A person's hand is crucial to get the proper fit. A ball driller should be able to not only determine the flexibility and the size and the strength of the person's hand to properly fit a bowling ball. You have the flexibility of the fingers, the elasticity and also the length and size. The is the same point. The flexibility, the size, and the lateral movement makes a big difference on how you're going to fit the ball in order to get out of the ball properly. When holding a ball, you have to make sure that not only the tension is taut, but it's also relaxed. \n\nThere's a fine line between being too strong of a grip and not enough grip. Properly fitting a ball, you're hand should be submerged in the ball and also with a little tension. Your fingers actually give yourself a little bit of leverage for holding the ball. So it's very important that that thumb and the fingers are fit properly in order to hold the ball and release it at the same time. The proper fit of a bowling ball to a person and player is very crucial, and that's how you get the proper fit.", "title": "How to Be Fitted for a Bowling Ball | Bowling", "publishedDate": "2013-10-16T20:26:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0NeafCHczYA", "description": "Colors: Black (shown), Red, Silver\nSizes: 2-inch, 3-inch\nCurrent Price: http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/56608/i/pro-armor-4-point-harness?SiteID=YT_VD_proarmor4point&WT.mc_ID=14004\nPro Armor knows what it takes to keep you and your UTV safe.

Varied varieties of flowers with all different colours are in full bloom during this season. This is the indeed the best time for the enthusiastic photographers to grab their cameras and head start out to Kaas. One can capture different flowers here which are indeed incredible to watch; as such this is aptly titled as \"Valley of Flowers\".\n\nKas/Kaas Plateau is a lateritic soil plateau on the ridge of North Western Ghats of India located to the west of Satara, Maharashtra. Kas plateau has only a shallow upper layer soil in scattered depressions and composed of exposed porous soft rock. The plateau is filled with small rivulets and ponds. The origin of its name 'Kaas' is still unclear yet this was once home to 'kaasa' plants Elaeocarpus. Probably the place got its name from the 'Kaasa' plant. Kas Plateau is recently recognised by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site.  The flora on Kas plateau consists of herbaceous plants many of them being ephemerals dotted with clumps of shrubs, memecylon being the dominant species. The floral extravaganza at Kas begins with the advent of North West monsoon. The spectacle of Kas flowers has been unfolding each year after surviving through annual grazing and burning, yet Kas is threatened by the insurgence of thousands of visitors thronging the plateau on peak flowering days. Satara is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India. The town is 2320 ft. above sea-level, near the confluence of the Krishna and its tributary river Venna. The city was the capital of the Maratha empire in the 17th century, hence one of the historical cities of Maharashtra. This city is the capital of Satara Tehsil, as well as Satara District.\n\nSource: Wikipedia \n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

No clip, just the song and bandpic.Stichting 't viaduct, Groningen, nL. Produced by Jan Heddema.\nOn Tympanic:\n\nHet best bewaarde geheim van Groningen. (Groningens best kept secret!)Tympanic telt niet minder dan drie broers uit het roemruchte geslacht Gubbels in de gelederen. Oudste broer Henk snoof ooit aan landelijke roem met Weekend At Waikiki, dat trouwens furore maakte tot diep in de toenmalige Sovjet-Unie. Zijn twee jongere broertjes deden het niet onaardig in Tender Mercy, dat het nog behoorlijk ver schopte in Grote Prijs-verband. Als Tympanic doen zij aan messcherpe gitaarnoise, doorsneden met felle metal en donkere psychedelica. Denk aan Melvins, Helmet, Motorpsycho, Monster Magnet. Vooral live een ongekende, intense sensatie, dat Tympanic. Op de plaat vallen ze trouwens nog niet te horen, in tegenstelling tot de andere kant van de gebroeders Gubbels. Want zij zijn ook nog Cochon Bleu, een redelijk stijlvast en zeer behoorlijk opererend cajun- en zydeco-gezelschap, dat dezer dagen al wel met een CD komt. Zoiets kun je muzikale schizofrenie noemen, maar de mannen van Tympanic/Cochon Bleu varen er wel bij en hun respectievelijke publieksgroepen ook.
