Koch\nScreenwriter: Neil Simon\nFilm Description: Compulsive neatnik Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) is thrown out of his house by his divorce-bound wife. He wanders aimlessly through the streets of New York, toying with the idea of suicide, before gravitating to the apartment of his best friend, incorrigibly sloppy sportswriter Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau). Worried that Felix will try something desperate, Oscar, himself in the process of being divorced by his wife, invites Felix to move in with him. Within a few days, this mismatched pair is on the verge of mutual murder: Felix cannot abide Oscar's slovenliness, while Oscar is driven insane by Felix's obsession with cleanliness. A potentially passionate evening with Oscar's neighbors, the \"coo-coo\" Pigeon sisters (Monica Evans and Carole Shelley) is ruined when Felix, ruminating over his wife and children, reduces the two ladies to remorseful tears. Pushed to the brink, Oscar stalks around the apartment making as big a mess as possible. Comes the next week's poker game, and the previously vengeful Oscar is worried that Felix might have attempted to do away with himself again. Instead, a surprisingly self-confident Felix shows up to collect his belongings, then announces that he's temporarily moving upstairs with the toothsome Pigeon sisters! There's a laugh a second in this faithful movie adaptation of Neil Simon's hit Broadway play. A foolproof comic situation (allegedly based on a chapter in the life of Simon's brother Danny) is kept alive and healthy by some of the funniest dialogue ever written. The Odd Couple was later adapted into a long-running TV sitcom starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman.\n\n\"the odd couple\",\"the odd couple clip\",\"the odd couple episodes\",\"the odd couple theme\",\"the odd couple part 1\",\"the odd couple trailer\",\"the odd couple theme song\",\"the odd couple 2\",\"the odd couple tv show\",\"the odd couple intro\",\"the odd couple christmas\",\"jack lemmon\",\"walter matthau\",\"gene saks\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"screwball comedies\",\"howard w koch\",\"apartment videos\",\"oscar madison\",\"felix ungar\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++35944,/m/040z9,/m/0gyy0", "title": "The Odd Couple (7/8) Movie CLIP - Oscar Breaks Down (1968) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-07T12:58:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VOUJ7bbesk", "description": "Call 888-925-2218 to get tested today!

This accepting nature that Norm (God) is proving to have is one of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century that has shown many the true scientific specifications of God like a manual for It and for consciousness in general hinting at its adaptability/programmability to the point of FADING AWAY for the individuals who choose the atheistic LIFE STYLE/CHOICE. So the future of humanity on our planet as an untapped vessel and as a source of personal accomplishment/satisfaction will be in spiritually and physically interfering in the management of existing quarters of the cosmos, and creation / regeneration of new parts for it.

Known for his bold artistic vision and fresh dynamic interpretations of classical Chinese music, Mr Chiang collaborated and struck notes with the NYPCO members to introduce western music, Chinese pop, evergreen songs and even Japanese and Korean pop pieces into the repertoire.\n\nIn October 2010, the Orchestra's performance clip of a specially-arranged K-pop Medley was put on YouTube and amassed more than 28,000 views worldwide within a short space of time, making it the fourth most favorite music clip on YouTube for that month! Numerous international websites, including Korean sites, as well as local media, such as The New Paper, featured the success of this viral hit. \n\nThanks to the nurturing support endowed by the NYP management, the NYPCO has grown from strength to strength, giving the young performers new opportunities and inspiration to hone their musical talents and enrich their learning journey. \n\nIn 2007, the Orchestra competed internationally for the first time. At the Australian International Music Festival, the Orchestra set a new record in the Festival's 18-year history for being the first performing group to secure perfect scores from the entire panel of international adjudicators. They were subsequently invited to perform at the Festival's Command Performance at the Sydney Opera House to a standing ovation. \n\nIn 2011, the Orchestra clinched another gold medal at the 2011 Asia Pacific Chinese Music Exchange and Competition in Taiwan, despite facing tough competition from Chinese Orchestras from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The competition was adjudicated by a panel of nine eminent composers, Chinese classical musicians and renowned academics from around the region. NYPCO received the highest marks allocated in the competition. \n\nStudents and alumni members of the NYPCO are also privileged to be able to walk the distance in dedicating their musical talents to worthy causes by performing in charity events for the less fortunate. These include performances staged for the Chinese Development Assistance Council's Ready for School Project as well as fund-raising projects in aid of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Foundation and the PAP Community Foundation.", "title": "Paparazzi - Nanyang Polytechnic Chinese Orchestra", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06T12:37:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VRr71HVgOU", "description": "Visit http://ilectureonline.com for more math and science lectures!\n\nIn this video I will show you how to find the heat and work done from a P-V diagram using the 1st Law of Thermodynamics", "title": "Physics - Thermodynamics: (5 of 22) P-V Diagram And The First Law Of Thermodynamics", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T14:15:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VRsQ7T_SA8", "description": "Eli Kari Gjengedal decides to go invisible in her last ever weather forecast on TV2 in Norway.

They are among the best known local populations due to their residence near the many game parks of the African Great Lakes, and their distinctive customs and dress.[3] The Maasai speak Maa (\u0254l Maa),[3] a member of the Nilo-Saharan language family that is related to Dinka and Nuer. They are also educated in the official languages of Kenya and Tanzania, Swahili and English. The Maasai population has been reported as numbering 841,622 in Kenya in the 2009 census,[1] compared to 377,089 in the 1989 census.[4]\n\nThe Tanzanian and Kenyan governments have instituted programs to encourage the Maasai to abandon their traditional semi-nomadic lifestyle, but the people have continued their age-old customs.[5] Recently, Oxfam has claimed that the lifestyle of the Maasai should be embraced as a response to climate change because of their ability to farm in deserts and scrublands.[6] Many Maasai tribes throughout Tanzania and Kenya welcome visits to their village to experience their culture, traditions, and lifestyle.[7]\n\nAccording to their own oral history, the Maasai originated from the lower Nile valley north of Lake Turkana (Northwest Kenya) and began migrating south around the 15th century, arriving in a long trunk of land stretching from what is now northern Kenya to what is now central Tanzania between the 17th and late 18th century. Many ethnic groups that had already formed settlements in the region were forcibly displaced by the incoming Maasai,[11] while other, mainly southern Cushitic groups, were assimilated into Maasai society. The resulting mixture of Nilotic and Cushitic populations also produced the Kalenjin and Samburu.[12]", "title": "Masai Traditional Dance Maasai Mara", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T19:41:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VS8GEFYTGM", "description": "L\u00e4nnen farmari (I'm an Old Cowhand) -- fox-trot.

First meeting took place on July 1st - members of the band (which were: the formentioned founder, vocalist Valyen Songbird and bass player Bartek Biedro\u0144czyk) played the piece 'Metanoia' and some Opeth and Dream Theater covers. August was the time when drummer Maciek 'Graveborn' Borecki joined the band; early autumn when Piotrek Golis [ex-Anamnezis] began to rehearse on the lead guitar. Not-so-fruitful coexistance with Bartek came to the end in January 2013; few months later Artur Moska\u0142a [ex-Ishtar Gate] took his place. At the moment we're recording our first EP and starting to give live gigs.\n\nZesp\u00f3\u0142 powsta\u0142 w czerwcu 2012 z inicjatywy Wojtka Muchowicza - w zamierzeniu mia\u0142 wykonywa\u0107 muzyk\u0119 z pogranicza metalu i rocka, \u0142\u0105cz\u0105c\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cne elementy progresji.

Od sierpnia wraz z za\u0142o\u017cycielami Valyen Songbird, Bartkiem i Wojtkiem gra Maciek 'Graveborn' Borecki, a w pa\u017adzierniku sk\u0142ad uzupe\u0142ni\u0142 Piotrek [ex-Anamnezis]. W styczniu 2013 kapel\u0119 opuszcza Bartek, a na jego miejsce wskakuje Artur Moska\u0142a [ex-Ishtar Gate]. Pr\u00f3by odbywaj\u0105 si\u0119 w Zabrzu. .

I decided to take my chances and ask the zoo's PR representatives if they would also go on camera for me.\n\nThey immediately agreed to help me. I learned that the lionesses have no blood on their paws, at least not directly. They left the deer alone as soon as they were called back into their enclosure. The PR rep told me that they are highly trained. They weren't allowed to finish their hunt main because the deer might spread diseases to the animals.\n\nThe zoo sees a host of visitors wandering in from Rock Creek Park. Raccoons, fox, squirrels and pigeons frequently make their way into the exhibits, but this is the first time the lions had the chance to hunt live prey.\n\nAt one point, the deer made an escape and jumped into the water cheered on by many onlookers. However, when the vets took the injured young animal in to be treated, it couldn't be saved.

You can see I have a miniaturized table here. And the casino table is a little bit bigger than this, but the same basic rules apply.\n\nCheck with your table in the casino. Normally the table minimums will be about $5 or $10. I'm just going to use a couple of chips here. The game starts with a player placing a bet on the pass line, and then the dice go around the table in clockwise fashion from player to player. They all represent the shooter. \n\nFor this I'll be the shooter here. You pick two dice. You'll be given five, and you get to pick any two you like. You take two; these come up against the wall, and we've got two stages of play here. First up when this puck is in the off position, that means we're on the come out roll. That means you're rolling the dice up against the wall, and you're looking for a seven or eleven. If a seven comes up you win even money, just like that. If an eleven comes up the same thing. If a two, three, or twelve come up then they take your money, and then you have to start again. \n\nSo, any other number that comes up typically, like an eleven came up there, so you would get paid. Any other point that would come up, in this case five, that becomes your point. Now I take this puck and I put this in an on position, so now this is the second part of the game on the pass line. Now the object of the game is to get another five before you roll a seven to win. And it doesn't matter; you could roll any other numbers in the meantime and it doesn't matter. You could roll, see I rolled a nine, and I just have money on the five, so it doesn't matter, I just keep rolling. \n\nI keep rolling, and roll another nine, and that keeps going on until I roll either another five, or if I roll a seven. In this case, I rolled the five, which is good news, the crowd goes wild. He gets paid and takes his winnings, puts it up on the rack up there. This puck goes in the off position. When we're in the off position again, then we're going to come out and you roll a seven or eleven again to win another bet. And that is the basic rules of craps.", "title": "Basic Rules of Craps | Gambling Tips", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T14:25:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VovJZ42xXY", "description": "From Fate/Extra Limited Sound Track.\nRemix of the Emiya theme from Fate/stay night. \n\nOfficial name of the track: survant_stay_night (archer, nobody knows him/the hero)\n\nI don't own anything, all trademarks and copyrights are owned by their respective creators (TYPE-MOON, Marvelous Entertainment), and all of that legal stuff.", "title": "Fate/Extra OST: theme of Archer / Unlimited Blade Works", "publishedDate": "2010-10-09T14:19:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Vozr9vHeMo", "description": "TWEET IT - http://clicktotweet.com/he8Re\n\nWhat happens when the condom breaks?

Authorities displayed massive stacks of cash that were seized in the raids, which were the result of 80 search warrants, according to an FBI spokeswoman.\n\nOne of the indictments described the torture of a U.S. citizen drug distributer by the Sinaloa Cartel at a ranch in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. \u201cVictim A\u201d was kidnapped, held hostage and beaten, shot, electrocuted, and water-boarded at the ranch in fall 2012, according to the indictment.\n\nThe victim incurred a \u201cdebt\u201d to the cartel when 100 kilograms of cocaine he or she and two family members intended to distribute in America was seized by U.S. federal agents.\n\nThe two relatives were forced to pay $140,000 in cash ransom for \u201cVictim A\u201d to Q.T. Fashion, a clothing wholesale business on 12th Street, according to an indictment.  Q.T. Fashion allegedly worked with a Mexican clothing firm called Maria Ferre to funnel the ransom money through 17 other Fashion District businesses to the cartel.\n\n\u201cVictim A\u201d was released from the Sinaloa ranch when a payment was made in December 2012; the victim is currently in the U.S., federal officials said.\n\nQ.T.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\". Kecuali Wajah dan telapak tangan.", "title": "188 Video Cara Memakai Jilbab Pashmina 2 Warna by Mersil 27 03 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T21:24:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Vw5_fspWcQ", "description": "Get an Inside Look at Doctor Who's Ep 10 \"In The Forest of the Night\" with exclusive interviews with stars Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman.\n\n*** SPOILER ALERT.

Featuring Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen, Genera Energy CEO Dr. Kelly Tiller and DuPont Biofuels Director Dr. William Provine.\n\nTITLE\nTENNESSEE\n\nBRAD BLACK\nTENNESSEE FARMER\nOur farm lies in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains. We've been here since 1820. This land is as important to me as one of my kids.\n\nMAIN TITLE\nHARVESTING FOR FUEL\n\nPHIL BREDESEN\nGOVERNOR OF TENNESSEE\nThe crisis that's going to occur in terms of our security, the finances of our country, when oil starts coming to an end, are just awful.\n\nDR. KELLY TILLER\nCEO, GENERA ENERGY\nThe reality is fossil fuels are a finite resource, and as we deplete them they're not being regenerated. If you contrast that with what you're seeing here, every single acre you're looking at of switchgrass could be a thousand gallons of fuel, year after year.\n\nBRAD BLACK\nWhen Doc Tiller first said that she was going to turn the switchgrass plant into gasoline or ethanol I thought, \"Well, you know, stranger things have happened.\"\n\nDR. KELLY TILLER\nWhat we're really doing in the bio-refinery is demonstrating, in a very large scale, how to extract sugars from plants. Once we have sugars, then we know how to make very useful fuels and other products from those.\n\nDR. WILLIAM PROVINE\nBIOFUELS DIRECTOR, DUPONT\nThe energy demands are so huge around the world. In the US, alone, there's 150 billion gallons of gasoline used today. We want to make a significant fraction of that renewable. This enterprise is a joint venture between Genera, DuPont and Danisco. And by combining those specialized talents together, you make the winning proposition. If you act alone, more likely you'll lose alone.\n\nDR. KELLY TILLER\nWhat we'll see over time is that various regions of the world will have different crops that are a best fit locally. \n\nPHIL BREDESEN\nThe answer is think globally and act locally. This, to me, is a perfect example of doing that.\n\nDR. KELLY TILLER\nA lot of farmers have a lot of pride in the fact that they are part of a solution to a global problem.\n\nBRAD BLACK\nWe're trying our best to produce food and fuel for generations to come.", "title": "DuPont Works with Local Farmers in a Switchgrass Based Ethanol Renewable Energy Program", "publishedDate": "2011-05-19T17:01:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Vz7b5EGeR0", "description": "", "title": "What the word crab means to me.mov", "publishedDate": "2010-05-08T02:18:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VzCgGU0-9k", "description": "", "title": "Lid van Jan Smit V3.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-01-28T17:16:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VzbRjU8F_c", "description": "Gaviscon - Heartburn & Indigestion TV Commercial", "title": "Gaviscon - Heartburn & Indigestion TV Commercial", "publishedDate": "2013-05-13T19:10:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VzpfEsMSIA", "description": "TiKi Official Fan Page https://www.facebook.com/TiKi.Official1", "title": "Tiki feat  Maksi -  Dhezim Flak  ( qmimi 3t Kosova fest 2010 )", "publishedDate": "2010-12-20T13:32:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7W-38flT2sM", "description": "Guitarra - Antonio Carrion", "title": "ANTONIO NU\u00d1EZ \"EL CHOCOLATE\" - Solea", "publishedDate": "2010-12-29T21:13:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7W-9NNGG1RQ", "description": "MOMO / Dumpling Recipe - Nepali style \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n2Ai9qlcic\n\n7 Ways To Fold a Dumpling or Momo - Part 1 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh5_DuuxHC0\n\n7 Ways To Fold a Dumpling or Momo - Part 2 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gjn1S3cb2s\n\nPani Puri - Easy Recipe \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CffoPRqgbWY\n\nGlowing Green Smoothie Recipe for Great Skin & Weight Loss\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00MVja_jueQ\n\nSpicy Potato Salad Recipe - Nepalese Cuisine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yaSDTArg8&list=PLDsPvQID9hNdqn_BH6zqhxXSxCQbtpEjT&index=1\n\nWai Wai Chatpat Recipe - Hot & Spicy Nepali Snack\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbBrKlC1k2s&list=PLDsPvQID9hNdqn_BH6zqhxXSxCQbtpEjT&index=5\n\nHie guys, Welcome back to channel and Today I'm going to show you how to make Bhatta ko Chuntey, in english Soyabean Chutney.

This was a vehicle for Everett's characters and sketches (his fellow writers were Ray Cameron, Barry Cryer and Dick Vosburgh), interspersed with the latest pop hits, either performed by the artists themselves, or as backing tracks to dance routines by Arlene Phillips' contemporaneously risqu\u00e9 dance troupe Hot Gossip (which featured Sarah Brightman).\n \nVarious pop and TV stars made cameo appearances on the show, including Rod Stewart, Billy Connolly, Kate Bush, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury, Terry Wogan and Suzi Quatro and classical musicians such as Julian Lloyd Webber.\n \nEverett would often ad-lib and deviate from the script; his bloopers were sometimes left in the final cut and on several occasions he pulled the camera around the studio revealing the crew not quite sure what was going to happen next. Quite often the crew were victims of his humour -- on one occasion Everett encouraged the crew to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to a cameraman, presenting to him a cake which he duly pushed in the cameraman's face.\n \nThere were also the stories of Captain Kremmen, a science fiction hero voiced by Everett and originally developed for his Capital Radio shows, who travelled the galaxy battling fictional alien menaces, along with his assistant Dr Gitfinger and his voluptuous sidekick Carla. In the first three series these segments were animations created by the Cosgrove-Hall partnership (responsible for the successful children's cartoon series Dangermouse, among many others). In the fourth series (Video Cassette) Kremmen was featured as live action, with Anna Dawson playing Carla; the segments were comedy shorts, rather than the earlier stories.\n \nOther characters included: aging rock-and-roller Sid Snot, unsuccessfully flipping cigarettes into his mouth -- at one point Everett managed to catch one in his mouth, to the amusement of the studio crew; Marcel Wave, a lecherous Frenchman played by Everett wearing an absurdly false latex chin; and \"Angry of Mayfair\", an upper middle class City gent complaining of the risqu\u00e9 content of the show, banging the camera's lens hood with his umbrella, and then storming off, turning his back to us, only then to be revealed as wearing women's underwear in lieu of the entire back half of his suit.\n \nHe also created the never-seen character of 'Lord Thames', supposedly the owner of Thames Television (the company was actually owned by two conglomerates). The character was often the butt of Everett's rants and was said to symbolise his contempt for senior management at the company, claiming they lived behind an ancient, cobweb-covered door marked as the \"Office Of Saying 'No'\". Thames never disciplined him for these comments, unlike prior employers such as the BBC.\n \nEverett's interest in (then primitive) video processing technology and electronic effects showed itself in such features as the appearances of a bobbing 'alien' entirely composed of a distorted video image of his own head (\"Hello. I'm Spod, from Planet Thfnnnn. And this is all I do... Pathetic, isn't it?\").\n \nThe series ran for four seasons on ITV, and was a big ratings hit. The last episode ended on a rather sour note (after Everett had locked horns with Thames management over his show and its scheduling) with Everett giving a restrained farewell speech as the set and scenery was being stripped down by the crew. The final shot before the closing credits was Everett himself being picked up and placed inside an oversized dustbin.\n \nIn Australia, complaints resulted in ongoing censorship of the programme, especially the Hot Gossip segments due to the provocative, skimpy and highly revealing costumes and leotards worn by the dancers.", "title": "The Kenny Everett Video Cassette: Terry Wogan gets his on 'Star Quiz'.", "publishedDate": "2012-02-05T20:32:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7WG-eyPs5R8", "description": "Katie Cassidy's got some real mental issues in The Scribbler\n\u2605 Sub NOW \u25ba http://bit.ly/TRAiLERS \u2605 Join us on Facebook http://facebook.com/HorrorScifiMovies\n\u2605 Best Sci-Fi Movies are here  \u27a8 http://bit.ly/Sci-Fi-Movies \n\nTHE SCRIBBLER follows Suki (Katie Cassidy), a young woman confronting her destructive mental illness using \"The Siamese Burn,\" an experimental machine designed to eliminate multiple personalities.

The video shows, at the pause, that the structure of the bound domain of light and heavy chain allows for an antigen to attach itself between the red and yellow areas at the end of the molecule due to the absence of bulky bonds between the two chains.

Current Tivoli platform enables IDBI to move towards delivering IT as a service to internal customers. Tivoli is integrating, Tivoli is empowering.\n\n\nSanjay Sharma, Advisor-IT, MD & CEO, IDBI Intech Ltd\n\n\nWe found IBM Tivoli Particularly valuable from the point of view of completeness of Vision in the space of infrastructure management in the sense that it offered us not only what we will what we needed now but also what we will most definitely need tomorrow. IDBI needed to manage the disparate heterogeneous infrastructure as an integrated goal from a single console. Tivoli is helping us do that today. IBM Tivoli has enabled us to move from a dock manageability approach to a best practice base analytical approach but most importantly it has integrated all our IT infrastructure pieces and enabled to have a unified manageability paradigm for the disparate heterogeneous steps. Our future road map is to keep extending the IBM Tivoli management platform that we have set up. One of the immediate steps that we see for ourselves is to use IBM tivoli for in-depth performance and  response time analysis of our applications. Current Tivoli platform also enables us to move towards delivering IT as a service to our internal customers using IBM Tivoli.

Two of these species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia.\n\nMembers of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5--5 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400--600 g); and a large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their powerful premolar and molar teeth to grind up plant food.The Indian rhinoceros, or greater one-horned rhinoceros, (Rhinoceros unicornis) has a single horn 20 to 100 cm long. Its size is comparable to that of the white rhino in Africa. Its thick, silver-brown skin forms huge folds all over its body. Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart-like bumps, and it has very little body hair. Grown males are larger than females in the wild, weighing from 2,500--3,200 kg (5,500--7,100 lb). Shoulder height is 1.75--2.0 m (5.75--6.5 ft). Females weigh about 1,900 kg and are 3--4 m long. The record-sized specimen was approximately 3,800 kg.\n\nIndian rhinos once inhabited many areas ranging from Pakistan to Burma and maybe even parts of China. However, because of human influence, they now only exist in several protected areas of India (in Assam, West Bengal, and a few pairs in Uttar Pradesh) and Nepal, plus a few pairs in Lal Suhanra National Park in Pakistan. It is confined to the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas. Two-thirds of the world's Indian rhinoceroses are now confined to the Kaziranga National Park situated in the Golaghat district of Assam, India.\nSources :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros", "title": "Rhinoceros, in the NANDANKANAN ZOO,Odhisha,India", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T16:08:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7WaUhkDxbS4", "description": "4 ragazzi e un sogno che diventa realt\u00e0", "title": "formentera 2008 e la passerina", "publishedDate": "2008-08-13T12:36:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7WahBH9sANg", "description": "\"Oh Myyy!

They are found in the wild along stream banks and on the borders of swamps.  They are extremely adaptable as regards site and conditions, but prefer a well-drained but moist acid high-humus soil.  Light shade or full sun is just fine, although I have seen one or two growing under Oaks and Tulip Poplars, and they flowered reliably. They are reputed to be pollution tolerant, but on that point I will not stake my reputation. There is pollution and there is POLLUTION, in my opinion, and where the line that divides tolerant and intolerant depends on whether you live in Chester, PA or Chester, CT.\n\nThe main display for the American Fringe tree happens in early June here in Connecticut, lasting for about three weeks, if the weather permits.  Too hot or too much rain, and the flowers will either wilt or get knocked off the tree.

The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning one's teeth. The ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue, as is widely believed.

After a long trip home from Gawler, South Australia to Melbourne, Victoria, we set about cleaning out the sludge in the sump. Then after a little TLC around the injector pump an injectors, ensuring oil pressure was ok, it fired up easily, first on 1 cylinder, then the other two joined in. I still plan on a \"cosmetic\" restoration though, sandblast, painting etc. Then I will pair it up with a 15 Kva 240 volt alternator and set up properly in a purpose made tandem trailer. It goes to show how well made these were. This engine is about 69 years old, and looks to have had a very hard life so far. Now it's time to give it the care and dressing up it deserves!

Your defense attorney thought one thing, and they thought another.\n\nSecond,  it could have been a mis-communication, or a mis-understanding of terms. Many deals have numerous aspects or conditions. Kinda like, \"if this then that\" or \"if that then this.\" It could involve the final charges (offenses), time periods of probation or jail, conditional discharges, money (as in fines), special conditions (aka drug/alcohol treatment/restrictions). \n\nThe renege could have also come about because of a re-review of a file by a judge or assistant DA, new or recently discovered evidence (blood test results, prior offense history, new charges), or a change of assistant DAs, or a change of policy.\n\nThird and last, what can be done is a re-sit down. \n\nsee my blog post on a recent DWI plea renege here:\n\nhttp://ithacadwi.blogspot.com/2014/07/can-district-attorneys-renege-on-dwi.html\n\nAlways remember to consult with an attorney about any criminal or non-criminal charges you have pending to discuss your options and/or defenses.\n\nhttp://www.ithacadwi.com\n\nnewman.lawrence@gmail.com\n607-229-5184\n\nReviews of Larry Newman:\n\nhttp://www.avvo.com/attorneys/14850-ny-lawrence-newman-530905.html\n\nChosen as a 2013 Rising Star in DWI/DUI in Upstate New York by Super Lawyers", "title": "Can the District Attorney Renege on a DWI Plea Bargain?", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T15:22:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Wq4EwsZ8Eg", "description": "Car bombs detonate in Baghdad and Iraq's city of Ramadi killing at least 20, including soldiers.

The distinction between a heron and an egret is rather vague, and depends more on appearance than biology. The word \"egret\" comes from the French word \"aigrette\" that means both \"silver heron\" and \"brush\", referring to the long filamentous feathers that seem to cascade down an egret's back during the breeding season.\nEgrets at dusk in Kolleru Lake, Andhra Pradesh, India\n\nSeveral of the egrets have been reclassified from one genus to another in recent years: the great egret, for example, has been classified as a member of either Casmerodius, Egretta or Ardea.\n\nIn the 19th and early part of the 20th century, some of the world's egret species were endangered by relentless plume hunting, since hat makers in Europe and the United States demanded large numbers of egret plumes, leading to breeding birds being killed in many places around the world.\n\nSeveral Egretta species, including the eastern reef egret, the reddish egret and the western reef egret have two distinct colours, one of which is entirely white. The little blue heron has all-white juvenile plumage.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\n \nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The dead whale had been lying on the beach for two days, after getting stuck in the waters between two islands, when marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen was sent to cut it open. As he made incisions in the whale's side the carcass exploded due to a build up of methane gas from the decomposition creating a loud sound and releasing a pungent smell. It is reported that a local museum will collect the skelton and put it on display.

In der Anatomie wird zwischen echten, das hei\u00dft mit einem fl\u00fcssigkeitsgef\u00fcllten Spalt versehenen, und unechten Gelenken unterschieden.

La synth\u00e8se du cholest\u00e9rol se fait principalement par la voie de l'hydroxym\u00e9thyl-coenzyme-A-r\u00e9ductase (HMG-CoA-r\u00e9ductase). Cette voie permet la synth\u00e8se de squal\u00e8ne et de lanost\u00e9rol desquels d\u00e9rivent de nombreux autres st\u00e9rols.

I decided to use it for a couple of days before I did a review/demo. So since I have been using this foundation and powder for the past couple days- my final outcome is- I LOVE IT! It is a sensational foundation for anyone who has oily or acne prone skin.\nRecently I switched my birth control and my hormones have been going crazy in the form of break outs and blemishs on my face. Today I went to get a facial and the girl told me that when you get breakouts around where I have them is due to hormones, and I knew the exact reason was because of my birth control switch. So anyway, after I solved the problems why I was getting the breakouts I needed to find a way to cover up the blemishes and red marks while I let my skin heal with the routine my facial lady told me to do. I googled \"Best Foundation for Oily Skin\" and it was on Elle Magazine online in which I found the Neutrogena Skin Clearing Oil Free Foundation!! I picked up two colors to mix them to make my perfect match.\nI love this foundation so much because it covers SO well, it is light weight, and it dries matte on you skin! I just topped it off with some of the Neutrogena Skin Clearing powder. I now only powder my skin once per day instead of every hour or so!\nSo overall this foundation I would reccommend to anyone!

The brain works harder to counteract sleep deprivation effects, but operates less effectively, and a person's ability to focus and complete tasks is impaired. \n\nInsufficient rest can even cause hallucinations and contribute to anxiety disorders and other psychiatric problems.\n\nOther possible sleep deprivation effects are:\n\n\u2022 Depression\n\u2022 Heart disease\n\u2022 Hypertension\n\u2022 Irritability\n\u2022 Slower reaction times.\n\nWeight changes, especially weight gain, are common sleep deprivation effects. The amount and quality of sleep affects hormone levels, particularly levels of leptin and ghrelin, which in turn affect physiological processes that depend on these hormone levels. This relationship further complicates the connection between sleep and health.\n\nLeptin is a hormone that affects feelings of fullness and satisfaction after a meal, and ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite. When people suffer from sleep deprivation effects, levels of leptin fall and ghrelin levels increase. This means that people end up feeling hungrier and may be less satisfied by eating, causing them to eat more and, consequently, gain weight.", "title": "Sleep deprivation effects:  The sleep deprivation effects can drive to obesity", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T10:22:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7XbMICiIsjo", "description": "", "title": "ussj2trunks (camus di aquarius surplice) vs aiolia di leo", "publishedDate": "2011-01-18T17:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7XbiCBeSSCQ", "description": "Siren the lurcher, 8-months-old, at lure coursing practice near Junction City, Oregon.

'Synaesthesia' was born on UK grounds, but became a Top 20 hit on global soil. It was only the beginning of a glorious career for The Thrillseekers, as Steve likes to veil himself. He's shared 12 years of co-production credits with Chicane and reworked Sonique's 'Feels So Good' into a worldwide number one record. But let's not forget about his own productions that have rocked the speakers, with 'By Your Side' and 'Waiting Here For You' reminding you of where it all started: 'Synaesthesia'.\n'Synaesthesia' is ready to re-conquer the dancefloors and hits a new, 2010 sound. A strong feel of reminiscences takes over as soon as this one hits the speakers, whether in its original or one of the remix versions in this pack. Steve himself presents his 'Thrillseeker's Live Xtreme Remix', on which he backed up the original with a stir of effects and freshness. With his 'Connected Remix', UK based DJ/producer Sonny Wharton contributes a more house oriented 'Synaesthesia' to the pack. British duo Vegas Baby take you down the deeper, more progressive road, while German Alex M.O.R.P.H. delivers a stunning uplifting version.

The Indian Peafowl is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent and has been introduced into many parts of the world and feral populations exist in many introduced regions. The peacock is the national bird of India.\n\nThe species is found in dry semi-desert grasslands, scrub and deciduous forests. It forages and nests on the ground but roosts on top of trees. It eats seeds, insects, fruits, small mammals and reptiles.\n\nFemales are about 86 cm (34 in) long and weigh 2.75-4 kg (6-8.8 lbs), while males average at about 2.12 m (7.3 ft) in full breeding plumage (107 cm/42 in when not) and weigh 4-6 kg (8.8-13.2 lbs). The male is called a peacock, the female a peahen. The Indian Peacock has iridescent blue-green plumage. The upper tail coverts on its back are elongated and ornate with an eye at the end of each feather. These are the Peacock's display feathers. The female plumage is a mixture of dull green, grey and iridescent blue, with the greenish-grey predominating. In the breeding season, females stand apart by lacking the long 'tail feathers' also known as train, and in the non-breeding season they can be distinguished from males by the green colour of the neck as opposed to the blue on the males.\n\nPeafowl are most notable for the male's extravagant display feathers which, despite actually growing from their back, are known as a 'tail' or train. This train is in reality not the tail but the enormously elongated upper tail coverts. The tail itself is brown and short as in the peahen. The colours result from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena. The ornate train is believed to be the result of female sexual selection as males raised the feathers into a fan and quiver it as part of courtship display. Many studies have suggested that the quality of train is an honest signal of the condition of males and that peahens select males on the basis of their plumage. More recent studies however, suggest that other cues may be involved in mate selection by peahens.\n\nThey lay a clutch of 4-8 eggs which take 28 days to hatch. The eggs are light brown and are laid every other day usually in the afternoon. The male does not assist with the rearing, and is polygamous with up to six hens.", "title": "Peacock - Peafowl \u0637\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633", "publishedDate": "2009-09-21T17:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YFQR3zmsK0", "description": "Archeage how to plant 10 pine trees on a large scarecrow...now Pines are considered the best trees to plant for THUNDERSTRUCK based on Korean and RU data\n\nArcheAge is an MMORPG developed by Korean developer Jake Song (former developer of Lineage) and his development company, XL Games.

Ships need to be built and equipped with weaponry and manpower and fights can be between players or against sea monsters.\n\nPlayer vs player (PvP)\nPlayer ships can be attacked.[8] Player constructed buildings, including castles, can be destroyed with siege weapons. City founding is possible by erecting floating city stones which can in turn be attempted to be captured by enemy forces.\n\nCrafting\nThe crafting system in ArcheAge is extensive, allowing crafting of, among other things, equipment, food, vehicles, and furniture for the player-owned homes.

Gegr\u00fcndet 1608 von Samuel de Champlain, blieb sie bis 1759 unter franz\u00f6sischer Verwaltung. In diesem Jahr entschieden die Briten die Schlacht auf der Abraham Ebene f\u00fcr sich; die Stadt musste kapitulieren, und der Frieden von Paris 1763 brachte sie mit ganz Kanada unter die britische Krone. \n\nZw\u00f6lf Jahre sp\u00e4ter scheiterte ein Versuch der USA, die Stadt zu erobern. Benannt ist sie, und damit die ganze Provinz, nach dem Ausdruck Kebek aus der Algonkin-Sprache, der Engstelle bedeutet, und die Flussenge des St-Laurent bei Qu\u00e9bec bezeichnet, wo sich der Fluss am leichtesten \u00fcberqueren lie\u00df.\n\nRund um den Place d'Armes und das Ch\u00e1teau Frontenac gibt es eine Reihe von Restaurants, die sowohl Touristen als auch Stra\u00dfenk\u00fcnstler anziehen.\n\nEin Abstecher auf die gegen\u00fcberliegende Seite des St-Laurent, nach L\u00e9vis lohnt sich.

Founded in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, it remained under French administration until 1759. In this year, the British decided the battle on the level of Abraham for themselves, the city capitulated, and the Peace of Paris in 1763 brought Quebec and all of Canada under the British crown. \n\nAn attempt of the USA to conquer the town failed twelve years later. The city and thus the whole province, is named according to the expression Kebek from the Algonquian language, describing the narrowness of the river of the St-Lauwrence at Quebec, where the river could be crossed most easily.\n\nAround the Place d'Armes and the Ch\u00e1teau Frontenac there are a number of restaurants that attract tourists, as well as street performers.\n\nA side trip to L\u00e9vis, on the opposite side of the St-Laurent is worthwile. From here you have the best view of the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac and the Citadel.\n\nAt night, Quebec shines in a true blaze of colour. If you feel like, you can now make your purchases. The Rue du Tr\u00e9sor is now used as a picture gallery.

So when you get to have a conversation with a child who was born deaf, that's just amazing and so rewarding to know that I'm part of that process. My name is Julie Martinez Verhoff and I am the director of audiology at the River School in Washington, D.C. \n\nAs a mentor, I train doctoral students in audiology. Currently we have a doctoral student named Jennifer who is really great. She was diagnosed with a hearing loss when she was five years old. The students love when they come into the clinic and they see Jennifer and they see her hearing aid. And they'll be like you wear a hearing aid, so do I. \n\n[Martinez Verhoff speaking to a patient, \"You ready? It's going to be on your left side.\"]\n\nIt's so rewarding to see the children here is once they get to the final grade\u2014to that 3rd grade\u2014and they leave and they're mainstreamed. That's amazing that they can go to the library and get a book by themselves. That they can pick up the telephone and talk to their friends. And these children can do that. They can sing. They can play violin. These are all exciting things and audiologists are a part of that.\"", "title": "Dr. Julie Martinez Verhoff: School Audiologist", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T19:23:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YdHl85l_Oc", "description": "Ver\u00e3o 2007  Cabo Verde Mergulho", "title": "Carenza Mergulho Cabo Verde", "publishedDate": "2007-12-02T19:11:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YdZl_rg5fQ", "description": "Skidmore Sonneteers Spring Jam 2012", "title": "The Water is Wide-- Sonneteers", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T00:44:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YdgPy21hBM", "description": "Tropic Thunder Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/z8iy2p\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nTugg (Ben Stiller) proves himself to Kirk (Robert Downey Jr.) as a true actor when he nearly misses a bomb and almost dies.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Dreamworks (2012)\nCast: Jay Baruchel, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Brandon T.

Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Cockburn takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Cockburn drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger.\n\n\"tropic thunder\",\"tropic thunder clip\",\"tropic thunder trailer\",\"tropic thunder tom cruise\",\"robert downey jr\",\"jack black\",\"nick nolte\",\"jay baruchel\",\"brandon t jackson\",\"bomb videos\",\"gun videos\",\"helicopter videos\",\"action comedies\",comedy,\"showbiz comedies\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"stuart cornfeld\",\"ben stiller\",\"eric mcleod\",\"patrick esposito\",\"justin theroux\",\"brian taylor\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++389934,/m/05wjnt,/m/01vsn38,/m/016z2j,/m/03c52ms,/m/0lkr7,/m/0mdqp", "title": "Tropic Thunder (10/10) Movie CLIP - You're My Really Cool Brother (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T19:57:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ydv9Ef-99I", "description": "So did they hear our FART IN FRANCE........\n\nWell 2 people say they did but we don't have any concrete evidence as yet but thanks to everyone thats supported this and thanks to the french for being such good sports maybe you can fart back someday.\n\nThanks to Tim Woods for the Drone footage.\n\nThe song Fart at the French is free to download for a wek from this link.\n\nhttp://we.tl/G9d3kIYtsy\n\nAnd the bands latest album is availible here\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-raven-tapes-ep/id776046332?uo=4\"\n\n\n\nTo contact me about this project email fartatfrance@yahoo.co.uk\n\nfollow me on twitter https://twitter.com/colin_furze\n\nand my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Colin-furze/521680751253584", "title": "Fart@France-The Result", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T15:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Ydy1eD-vkg", "description": "http://whiskerman.com\n\nGraham Patzner of Whiskerman playing Ram's Head on a violin at a top secret location in Oakland, CA.

She is six stories high and is listed on the National Park Registry of Historical Landmarks. The park is fenced and contained, making child supervision easy. Picnic tables are on site for eating out-of-doors.The site has friendly, trained volunteers and staff to assist you during your visit. On the tour you will learn about Lucy's unique architecture and her history and you will get to climb a spiral staircase through her insides all the way up to the howdah on her back, providing a spectacular 360\u00b0 view of the surrounding shore area.\n\nLucy the Elephant was built by real estate developer, James Lafferty, in 1881, as a gimmick to attract potential buyers to his land holdings along the coast of South Atlantic City (now Margate). Eventually, a popular hotel business was built around Lucy. Presidents and royalty came from around the world to stay at the neighboring Elephant Hotel and climb the stairs to Lucy's howdah. During her history, Lucy has survived hurricanes, ocean floods, and even a fire accidentally started by some inebriated party-goers when she served as a tavern. However, by the 1960's it became apparent there was one disaster Lucy could not overcome neglect. By that time, the once proud jewel of the South Jersey coast had become an almost hopeless, wretched wreck. Then in 1970, a developer purchased Lucy's land and intended to build a condominium building on the site. The beach and the ocean could stay - but the elephant had to go. To the rescue came the Save Lucy Committee. Within weeks, this small concerned group of ordinary citizens had raised enough money to move the entire decaying structure two blocks away to a new site owned by the city. Thirty years and over 1.5 million dollars later, Lucy was completely restored to her original splendor, inside and out. In 1976, Lucy was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States government as the oldest surviving example of a unique form of \"zoomorphic\" architecture, and the oldest \"roadside\" attraction in America. Today, she stands as the most popular non-gaming attraction in the greater Atlantic City region. She has brought fame to Margate City and is known all over the globe as \"The World's Largest Elephant.\"\n\nIn this short video Rebeca Nesselrode, Unravel Travel TV spoke to Richard Helfant, Executive Director / CEO, Lucy The Elephant.\n\nLucy The Elephant http://www.lucytheelephant.org\nAtlantic City, NJ  http://www.atlanticcitynj.com\n\nLIVE broadcast Unravel Travel TV http://www.unraveltraveltv.com\nUnravel Travel TV on You Tube http://www.youtube.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Twitter http://www.twitter.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Pinterest http://www.pinterest.com/unraveltraveltv\nUnravel Travel TV Website http://www.unraveltravel.eu", "title": "Lucy The Elephant, Atlantic City - Unravel Travel TV", "publishedDate": "2014-08-10T11:04:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YjmHh4AJsc", "description": "\"The Perfect Tune\", filmed in South Florida by Creative 101 is a simple  outdoor version of one of my oldest songs.", "title": "Isaac Thorny - The Perfect Tune", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T01:22:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YkNtLhLl78", "description": "It's my first video so be nice :)  I was really nervous, but I really want to thank John Graybill for giving me inspiration to do this.  \n\np.s.--sorry about the sound effects hahaha and I def should have fixed my hair", "title": "Limb Girdle Muscular Difficulty 2A--getting up off the couch and computer chair", "publishedDate": "2008-12-15T22:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YkWWAAglJ8", "description": "Multiprocess Firefox Electrolysis [e10s] demo in Ubuntu 14.04 linux\n\nhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis\n\nThe goal of the project is to run web content in a separate process from Firefox itself.

I need to put them together before adding my second layer of petals.\n\nLet's start with the center and I have my petals.  In order to add my wired petals, I need to bend back the petals so that they open up.  At this point, if I look at my petal, it looks like the petal is falling over.\n\nSo I want to grab the base of it and open it up.  Make sure you don't grab the top of it because, if you grab the top, it's just going to snap off; this is sugar that we're working with.\n\nSo I'm going to bend back my petal on the wire and I want to make it look like a little chair that I could sit in.  That way it will go right against my center of my flower.\n\nI'm going to attach three petals with floral tape.  I want to keep most of the floral tape in one hand and a tiny tab on the other side.  Fold it over and pinch the tape together.\n\nNow rotate the wires and pinch the tape.  Now I have bent the wire for a second petal.\n\nFor this layer I need to add three petals that are wired all the way around.  As soon as I have all three petals on, I can run the floral tape down the length of the wire and pinch off any extra floral tape that I have and just set that aside.\n\nI do have the ability to move the petals around just a little bit.  I want to make sure that my petals are roughly triangulated around the center. I'm just going to rest that right straight upside-down on my table before I add my next petal.\n\nNow I've rolled and cut my petals, just as I did for the first layer; it's exactly the same steps.  I cut it with my petal cutter, separated the pieces, pressed them onto the veiner.  The difference here is that I did not use wires; I'm not using wires on this layer.\n\nWhen I attach these petals to my flower, I use a teeny tiny little bit of glue on the petal edges; just trace the bottom edge, just a little bit.  Turn it over and attach it to my flower; I'm just going to press in.\n\nNow, tulips are very much like bell-shaped or trumpet-shaped, so when we're adding them, we want to make sure that the flower stays nice and round as we work around the flower.\n\nIf you have a little bit of extra, it's okay if a little piece of the petal works up the stem; we'll paint that stem later when we go to finish it off.  I need a little bit more glue for my third petal, and I attach that around as well.\n\nNow, if I need to, I can pick the flower up and push down the pieces.  And I can add a teeny tiny little bit more glue to make sure that everything sticks all the way around and then that shape stays nice and round as I work around the flower.\n\nNow all of my petals have been added. There are six total; three of them were wired and three of them were not.\n\nI'm going to leave my tulip upside-down, right on the table to dry overnight before I paint it.", "title": "How to Assemble a Tulip | Sugar Flowers", "publishedDate": "2013-05-22T14:03:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7YwtAJ9BB5o", "description": "More Targeted Gameplay Videos Than Anyone!

It is found in the wetlands of the plains of tropical Asia south of the Himalayas in the Indian Subcontinent and extending into Southeast Asia. Their distinctive pink tertial feathers give them their name. They forage in flocks in shallow waters along rivers or lakes. They immerse their half open beaks in water and sweep them from side to side and snap up their prey of small fish that are sensed by touch. As they wade along they also stir the water with their feet to flush hiding fish. They nest colonially in trees, often along with other waterbirds. They only sounds they produce are weak moans or bill clattering at the nest. They are not migratory and only make short distance movements in some parts of their range in response to food and for breeding. Like other storks, they are often seen soaring on thermals.This large stork has a heavy yellow bill with a down-curved tip that gives it a resemblance to an ibis. The head of the adult is bare and orange or reddish in colour. The long tertials are tipped in bright pink and at rest they extend over the back and rump. There is a distinctive black breast band with white scaly markings. The band continues into the underwing coverts and the white tips of the black coverts give it the appearance of white stripes running across the underwing lining. The rest of the body is whitish in adults and the primaries and secondaries are black with a greenish gloss. The legs are yellowish to red but often appear white due their habit of urohidrosis or defecating on their legs especially when at rest. The short tail is black with a green gloss.The Painted Stork is widely distributed over the plains of Asia. They are found south of the Himalayan ranges and are bounded on the west by the Indus river system where they are rare and extend eastwards into Southeast Asia. They are absent from very dry or desert regions, dense forests and the higher hill regions. They are rare in most of Kerala and the species appears to have expanded into that region only in the 1990s.They are mainly seen on freshwater wetlands although they sometimes forage on the coast. They are resident in most regions but make seasonal movements. Young birds may disperse far from their breeding sites and a juvenile ringed at nest in Keoladeo National Park has been recovered 800 kilometres away in eastern India.They breed in trees along with other water birds. The platform nests are typically placed in a tree on an island or in an otherwise undisturbed area. The best nesting sites are at the tops of the trees and birds jostle for these locations. In some areas where they have been left undisturbed they nest very close to human habitations.The breeding season begins in the winter months shortly after the monsoons. In northern India, the breeding season begins in mid-August[ while in southern India the nest initiation begins around October and continues till February and or even until April. A lot of variation is noticed in the onset of breeding across sites with the season at Kokrebellur and Edurupattu around January or February but at Telineelapuram, Kundakulam and Tirunelveli the breeding begins around October or November. Predation of eggs is mainly by crows and while very young chicks were sometimes attacked by crows, the older chicks were attacked by Black Kites. The typical clutch varies from 2 to 5 eggs with early breeders having larger clutches.Young chicks, when threatened, disgorge food and feign death by crumpling on to the nest floor.The incubation period is about a month while the fledging period is nearly two months.The occasional predation of chicks by migrant Aquila eagles has been observed.During the mid-day heat, adults will stand at the nest with wings outstretched to shade the chicks. To feed chicks, adults regurgitate fish that they have caught and these are typically smaller than 20 cm long.The daily requirement for chicks has been estimated to be about 500 grams made up of about 9 fish fed in two sessions.The bare red skin on the head is developed when reaching breeding maturity and involves the loss of feathers and the deposition of lipids under the skin. Birds in captivity have been known to live for as many as 28 years", "title": "Flight of Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) Flock in Sky", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T09:48:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Yysq204lGs", "description": "BSK Technologies (www.bsktechnologies.com) offers Economical Digital Battery operated 1\" line size water flow meter with flow rate indication and totaliser aval.

It is a miracle we take for granted. The book, as we know it today, evolved over many millennia of discoveries, technological innovations and adaptations.  And it is still evolving.\n\nNarrative carried our stories, and the invention of writing allowed us to preserve and to propagate them in our culture. The inventions of paper in China and of moveable type by Gutenberg made possible mass distribution of codified knowledge. Until then, knowledge was the domain of the privileged and the wealthy few.\n\nFrom the beginning, artists and craftsmen labored to make books object of beauty. We all love beautiful things: the design of fonts, the layout of the pages, the proportion of text to sizes of margins, color application. The making of books became an art form. We judge the content of a book as we read it, but it is human nature also to judge its success or failure as a visual artifact. \n\nThe late 20th Century brought us a new miracle, the digital codification of knowledge -- think of the book as an analog codification. As it was in the time of Gutenberg, new technology opens new paths. Today, it is not whether to copy by hand or to copy by machine, but whether to transmit knowledge through an analog media (books) or through a digital medium (e-reader). \n\nIt is possible that some time in the future paper books will become rare, objects for the privileged and the wealthy, as were illuminated manuscripts. But we are not there yet. Throughout the history of the book, new inventions and technologies were incorporated into the book to enrich it.  But, paper has limitations. It cannot play music or show moving pictures. It is heavy, making it difficult to carry more than a few books at a time.  On the other hand, I have never heard a person say when he pulls out an e-book,  \"I love the smell and the feel of this book.\" Why can't we have it all?\n\nToday, in early 21st century, many authors and publishers are taking advantage of the general-purpose nature of  e-readers to enhance the reading experience. But these early efforts merely mimic the paper book. In the Digital Over Analog (D/A) Book, we are experimenting with using digital media to enhance the contents of a book, much as footnotes do. But, D/A is much more.\n\n D/A Book combines a traditional, fine book with digital augmentations. The augmentations can be through music, images, voice and animation. D/A Book requires both a physical book and a digital viewing medium. The basic idea is that although the book is stand-alone, viewing the book pages through an App greatly expands and enriches the contents.\n\nOur first D/A book is about total eclipses of the sun. It is a two-sides accordion book; one side is a book about my feelings and observations on watching a total eclipse from a high desert in the Bolivian Andes. The other side is a chronologically arranged stories related to eclipses over the past four millennia. I wrote and made an artists book on the same subject ten years ago. It was totally inadequate. Why?\n\nFirst, my words were inadequate. But I feel any words are inadequate to describe the feelings that arise while watching an eclipse to anyone who has not had the same experience. What is the feeling that made emperors execute astronomers, generals sign truces, kings relinquish empires, people hide in terror? Second, how do you explain to people who are not familiar with geometry, the coincidental arrangement of the sun, the moon, and the earth that gives rise to this incredible phenomenon? Third, what were the historical contexts in which the myths arose?\n\nFor the past three to four years, ever since Apps for creating contents became possible, I have been thinking about how to make a 'digital' book out of my book on total eclipses. But I felt that whatever I could do in this medium could be better done as a video or a movie. What's the role of written narrative? Where's the book? A few months ago there came a moment of discovery. I was introduced to the technology of Augmented Reality. The software can view, through a camera, physical markings that trigger other software.  That software can play music or show animation. This was the 'aha' moment that led to the Digital Over Analog Book. With music I can create the mood and the feelings I experienced; I can explain the geometry through video -- I can 'show' the experience.\n\nD/A Book is only an experiment, an idea. I would feel wildly successful, if it can be considered a part of a bigger experiment that is the evolution of the book.", "title": "\"Totality\" D/a Digital over Analog book by PennyNii & Mohammed Allababidi", "publishedDate": "2012-02-24T19:02:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Z5DEgQCEmo", "description": "Please visit my Amazon A store for some great Radio Products.\nhttp://astore.amazon.com/af5dn-20\nPlease visit my web page @ http://www.AF5DN.com", "title": "Homebrew 20 Meter Dipole Antenna -- Home Depot / Lowes Part 3 - AF5DN", "publishedDate": "2012-11-21T02:34:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Z5IZkx9Afs", "description": "Purchase A THOUSAND CUTS now on Itunes -  http://bit.ly/AThousandCuts\n\nFacebook\nhttp://facebook.com/iamlocksmith\n\nTwitter\n@dalocksmith\nhttp://twitter.com/dalocksmith\n\nInstagram \nhttp://instagram.com/dalocksmith\n\nwww.IAMLOCK.com\nhttp://iamlock.com/\n\nSunny Los Angeles provides the beautiful landscape for Locksmith's latest video \"Free\" from his album A Thousand Cuts now available everywhere. \n\nVideo directed by Locksmith & Brian Storm\n\nTrack produced by Locksmith & Mike Blankenship", "title": "Locksmith - \"Free\" (feat.

It is the only non-episcopal country house in England to hold the title of palace. The palace, one of England's largest houses, was built between 1705 and circa 1724. UNESCO recognised the palace as a World Heritage Site in 1987.\n\nIts construction was originally intended to be a gift to John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough from a grateful nation in return for military triumph against the French and Bavarians at the Battle of Blenheim. However, it soon became the subject of political infighting, which led to Marlborough's exile, the fall from power of his Duchess, and irreparable damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh.\n\nDesigned in the rare, and short-lived, English Baroque style, architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s.[2] It is unique in its combined usage as a family home, mausoleum and national monument. The palace is also notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nThe building of the palace was a minefield of political intrigue by Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Following the palace's completion, it became the home of the Churchill family for the following 300 years, and various members of the family have in that period wrought various changes, in the interiors, park and gardens. At the end of the 19th century, the palace and the Churchills were saved from ruin by an American marriage. Thus, the exterior of the palace remains in good repair and exactly as completed.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "BhaBhi On Chair Talking Slang", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T11:13:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZB3qwoK-dc", "description": "Hey loves, I am using a cream instead of Gel for this wash and go.

Women who wish to have a medical abortion further than 10 weeks gestation can electively do so up to 24 weeks gestation.  The abortion pill process can be performed further than 24 weeks gestation in women where the pregnancy is a threat to the mother's life or health, a significant fetal abnormality, genetic defect, rape or incest.  \n\nRU 486 is combined with Misoprostol (Cytotec) to terminate pregnancies from 3 to 24 weeks in 99% of patients in 24 hours or less in 99% of patients.  The RU 486 abortion pill process works by attaching to the progesterone receptors on the uterine wall.  Progesterone is responsible for the maintenance of early pregnancies.  Without the presence of progesterone, the following occurs: 1) decidual necrosis of the uterus which leads to sloughing of the wall of the uterus, 2) detachment of the trophoblast layer (placental tissue) from the uterine wall, 3) cervical softening and dilation (opening) of the cervix, 4 increases uterine sensitivity of prostaglandins, 5) increase intrauterine pressure, 6) uterine contractions.\n\nThe second medication used in the abortion pill process (Misoprostol) works by binding to the prostaglandin receptors on the uterine wall which causes the uterus to contract and expelling of the fetus and gestational tissue.\n\nHow much is RU 486?  First trimester medical abortions cost $300 to $1,500.00.  For patients between 14.1 to 24 weeks the cost is $500.00 to $12,500.00.  For patients who are not able to afford the medical abortion procedure, we have non-profit organizations and private donors we can turn to in order to help with a portion of the abortion costs for women in one of the most difficult times in their lives.\n\nFor patients who have uterine bleeding and are soaking through more than two pads an hour for more than two hours, severe abdominal or low back pain chills and a fever of 100.4\u00b0F or higher after the day of the procedure, continuous nausea or vomiting or diarrhea that lasts more than 24 hours, an foul smelling genital discharge or signs of continuous pregnancy (nausea, vomiting, swelling of hands and feet, abdominal bloating etc.)\n\nOther side effects associated with the abortion pill procedure is abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or weakness that continues for more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol could be a sign of serious infection. Women should contact their physician, or go to an hospital if they have any of the above symptoms.\n\nPlease call our medical offices and ask about how the abortion pill process works.  We are here to serve you in one of the most difficult times in your life.\n\nhttp://www.womenscenter.com/abortion_pill.html", "title": "How Does the Abortion Pill Process Work", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T08:04:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZC-L9EAkqA", "description": "", "title": "Modest Mussorgsky cuadros de una exposicion- el gnomo", "publishedDate": "2011-05-07T03:47:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZCsZSckD8k", "description": "Luke has been obsessed with a video game.\nWatch JESSIE on Disney Channel! \nCheck out more JESSIE at http://www.DisneyChannel.com\nClick the SUBSCRIBE button to get notification when new Disney Channel videos are posted!", "title": "Krumping and Crushing - Clip - JESSIE - Disney Channel Official", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T00:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZDbBNcVa3Q", "description": "Sagittarius October 2014", "title": "Sagittarius October 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T23:15:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZDsMxoyPtM", "description": "Vidalia Chop Master, www.getchopmaster.com", "title": "Vidalia Chop Master", "publishedDate": "2013-02-14T15:40:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZDzGF8O798", "description": "", "title": "MARCELINHO CARIOCA   GOL DE PLACA   CORINTHIANS x SANTOSts", "publishedDate": "2011-06-10T23:10:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZE9arwAgU4", "description": "Plzz Comment and Subscribe", "title": "How to make a Paper Wallet...", "publishedDate": "2012-12-27T12:14:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZEbIRx0P7U", "description": "", "title": "VOCABULARY IN 20 LANGUAGES = Pithead winding gear", "publishedDate": "2011-04-06T06:34:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZEgNSJoVQI", "description": "", "title": "the making of the lithuanian costume", "publishedDate": "2009-12-04T13:18:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZFDMcXz_XY", "description": "Os acidentes mais il\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o os que acontecem em cruzamentos com sem\u00e1foros.

More specifically the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of chromosome 22 is fused with part of the Abelson (ABL) gene on chromosome 9.  The resulting BCR-ABL genetic domain now located within chromosome 22 and codes for a mutant tyrosine kinase also known as BCR-ABL.  Under normal circumstances tyrosine kinase proteins respond to external cellular messaging proteins, and ultimately initiate a series of reactions that culminate in cellular replication.  Conversely, BCR-ABL is constitutively active, meaning it does not require activation by the aforementioned cellular messaging proteins in order to stimulate cellular replication.  This results in acceleration of cell division, an inhibition of DNA repair, overall genomic instability, and the fatal blast crisis characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia. \n            The animation progresses to introduce Gleevec (imatinib), the first in a class of drugs that specifically target and competively inhibit the ATP binding site on BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase.  This prevents the ABL domain from phosphorylating the tyrosine residue, and as a result preventing the proliferation of hematopoietic cells that express BCR-ABL.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers in the brain. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering which acts as an electrical insulator.\n\nThere are several forms of ALD:\nThe classic childhood form, which is the most severe and affects only boys, may occur between ages 4 and 10. It affects only boys because the gene is on the X chromosome. Features of this form may include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, dysarthria (poorly articulated speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, melanoderma (increased skin pigmentation), and progressive dementia. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance.\nWomen carriers: Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the disorder. Symptoms are mild and may include spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs, ataxia, hypertonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary problems. \nThe milder adult-onset form typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include leg stiffness, progressive spastic paraparesis (stiffness, weakness and/or paralysis) of the lower extremities, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function.\nNeonatal (newborn) ALD affects both male and female babies. Symptoms may include mental retardation, facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, hypotonia (low muscle tone), hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and adrenal dysfunction. This form is usually quickly progressive.\n\nThe treatment for all forms of ALD is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy, psychological support, and special education may be useful for some individuals.\n\nThe prognosis for patients with ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nmedical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "What Is The Definition Of Adrenoleukodystrophy Medical Dictionary Free Online", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T18:01:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZPm5dbvE50", "description": "Nubble Lighthouse, northeast of York Beach, ME.

His funeral, though many hoped would be streamed live on the Internet, was private and closed to the public and media.  The Christian Post  spoke with a member who attended the service, T.J. Bristol, who stated that Tims' face appeared peaceful, serene and had a smile on his face.  The death of Zachery Tims stunned the nation as the popular, Charismatic pastor was frequently seen on The Word Network and TBN, giving him a much larger audience than his congregation of approximately 7,500.  Zachery Tims was known to have personal struggles and there is a possibility his death is drug related; but he is also known as a great man of God and a wonderful teacher with a compassionate heart for those hurting.  He may also be known for operating under the gift of prophesy as a new video shows Tims' preaching and apparently prophesying his own death.", "title": "Pastor Zachery Ex-wife Selling His Funeral Tape", "publishedDate": "2011-08-21T03:21:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZQgoVgAesY", "description": "Video explicativo de la resoluci\u00f3n de ejercicios de transformada inversa de Laplace.
