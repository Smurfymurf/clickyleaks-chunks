Olivia Chow, a left-leaning former federal politician, came in third with about 23 percent of the vote.\n\nBut Rob Ford, who made global headlines last year when he admitted to using crack cocaine while in office, was easily elected to the city council in west Toronto ward, a stronghold for the close-knit political family that has a base of supporters dubbed \"Ford Nation.\"\n\nRob Ford withdrew from the mayor's race in September after being diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer.\n\nHe threw his support behind his brother, a city councillor, who took his place on the mayoral ballot, and ran for city council instead on a populist platform of keeping taxes low and ending waste at city hall.\n\n\"Folks, if you know anything about the Ford family, we never ever, ever give up. And I guarantee, I guarantee in four more years you're going to see another example of the Ford family never, ever, ever giving up,\" Rob Ford told his supporters at a rally after the vote.\n\nElected with about 59 percent of the vote in the ward his brother Doug Ford had held, the mayor said he would continue to fight for the ordinary people and hinted at bigger goals in the 2018 election.\n\n\"Friends, I want to thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the dedication and I am so humbled, so humbled along with my family, by your support,\" Doug Ford said.\n\nRob Ford dropped out of the election after doctors revealed he has malignant liposarcoma, an aggressive type of cancerous tumour, in his abdomen. He is undergoing treatment in Toronto.\n\nTory, riding on a groundswell of \"anyone but Ford\" sentiment, was endorsed by every major newspaper in Toronto, home to about 6 million people.\n\nHe has pledged to improve Toronto's overcrowded and ageing public transit, identified by most voters as a top priority in the campaign.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Toronto Replaces Disgraced Mayor, Rejects Brother's Bid for Top Job", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T13:31:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MPsrnWDeLo", "description": "A thermistor is heated and the change in resistance is measured.

Many log splitters consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate. The higher the pressure rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split.\nMost log splitter models for home use have a rating around 10 tons, but professional hydraulic models may exert 25 tons of force or more. There are also manual log splitters, which use mechanical leverage to force logs through a sharpened blade assembly and screw or 'corkscrew' types that are driven directly from an agricultural tractor's power take-off shaft where the splitter is mounted on the three point linkage.\nAlthough smaller firewood splitters are intended for home, there are now many commercial units available. Some commercial splitters are part of a 'firewood processor' that saw logs of timber into lengths, split them, and then carry the wood up an inclined conveyor onto a pile or into a bag, truck or trailer. Specialty producers such as those producing maple syrup use units that split 4 foot lengths. Machines that split and point wood for fence post also exist though they are few in number as it is generally safer and more convenient to saw the posts.\nThe rising cost of domestic heating gas oil has reawakened a desire for alternative fuel sources and burning wood is carbon neutral. Modern wood burning stoves are efficient and safe. Many consumers that would not have considered splitting their own logs a few years ago are now burning wood fuel for both ecological and economical reasons.\nAlthough a good log splitter can save the operator hours of labor, it is not possible to make it completely safe. Only trained adults should operate a log splitter, since anything caught between the log and the splitting blade will receive at least 10 tons of pressure. Most hydraulic machines now have 'two handed operation' for safety which means that both of the operator's hands are needed to actuate the splitter thus keeping them out of the way of the moving blade. Moreover when using it a safety zone should be established around the splitter to prevent injury from flying splinters of wood.\nThe behaviour of each log can not be predicted, so a safety zone should be established around the splitter to prevent injury from flying splinters of wood.

The case roughly doubles the thickness of the iPhone and includes both a thermal and visible light camera. The FLIR ONE will capture and store both still thermal images and thermal video. The resulting stored data can be shared seamlessly through Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, or even saved to the iPhone camera roll.\n\nEvery object gives off heat, even if very cold. The FLIR ONE thermal camera takes thousands of measurements of this heat to create a meaningful thermal image of the world around you. Applications are almost endless: use it as a night vision camera, a security camera, or locate wildlife or a missing pet. Easily use the FLIR ONE to find energy leaks in a building such as missing insulation, or air leakage around doors and windows. Because it changes temperature at a different rate, water leaks or possible mold conditions are possible to detect with a thermal imager. Even use the FLIR ONE to identify dangerous electrical circuits or overheating motors and bearings.\n\nThe FLIR ONE MX app is available for free and offers a host of features. It includes FLIR's excellent MSX technology which combines the digital and infrared pictures to give the clearest image. You can also change the color palette of the thermal image for better clarity or user preference. Even turn the spot temperature measurement function on and off as needed.\n\nThe FLIR ONE Infrared Camera includes its own internal battery which will power the unit for up to two hours. If needed, the software app includes an option to use the FLIR ONE battery as a backup battery for the iPhone itself, similar to other available battery boost packs. The camera case charges through a standard micro USB.", "title": "FLIR ONE iPhone Infrared Camera Case", "publishedDate": "2014-01-08T04:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MTOQrpBGn0", "description": "Gary playing Dowland recorded at the Apex Bury St Edmunds in May 2011", "title": "Gary Ryan plays Dowland - Allemande", "publishedDate": "2011-06-23T22:53:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MTb9b4aSQU", "description": "Bachmann Porthole coaches close coupled with Roco 40270 couplers, topped and tailed by Hornby Stanier brake coaches fitted with Hornby R8220 couplers, hauled by ex Mainline Amethyst fitted with a Bachmann mechanism.

Various risk prediction scores are available to identify high-risk patients. We present here a pragmatic review of the literature discussing the main scoring systems.

Based on this, Caspar and Klug introduced quasi-equivalence theory to predict the relative locations of the coat proteins within these containers and classified virus structure in terms of T-numbers. Here it is shown that quasi-equivalence is part of a wider set of structural constraints on virus structure. These constraints can be formulated using an extension of the underlying symmetry group and this is demonstrated with a number of case studies. This new concept in virus biology provides for the first time predictive information on the structural constraints on coat protein and genome topography, and reveals a previously unrecognized structural interdependence of the shapes and sizes of different viral components. It opens up the possibility of distinguishing the structures of different viruses with the same T-number, suggesting a refined viral structure classification scheme. It can moreover be used as a basis for models of virus function, e.g. to characterize the start and end configurations of a structural transition important for infection.\n\nRead the paper here: http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0108767312047150", "title": "Structural constraints on the three-dimensional geometry of simple viruses - 1", "publishedDate": "2013-10-14T12:59:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Md3KrO6IzE", "description": "Learn an efficient trick to get to the top of a bar. \nCheckout my Website: http://www.ronniestreetstunts.com\n\nLike my videos? be sure to follow and like me on my other networks:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ronniestreetstunts\nhttp://www.twitter.com/ronnieshalvis\nhttp://www.instagram.com/ronniestreetstunts\n\nMusic:\nLogo Intro - Kitten Air - ScottDW http://www.youtube.com/user/scottdw?feature=watch\n\n03 Rameses B - Memoirs (Elliot Berger Remix)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQFGseXuAHK3b0CchWUvhNg\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ElliotBergerMusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ElliotBergerMusic\n\nOutro: Shadow Of The Mind (outro) by Per Kiilstofte (Machinimasound.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons CC-BY 3.0 Unported License | https://www.machinimasound.com/license", "title": "How to BAR KIP - Parkour Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2014-09-13T01:53:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6MdASt7Ti9w", "description": "This is my Corydoras Stream Aquarium.

Hi I'm Dan Moyle with AmeriFirst Home Mortgage and THIS... is your \"60 Second Mortgage Tip.\"\nAt its core, APR is essentially the \"annual percentage rate\" on a loan. APR is meant to help you as a home buyer - or borrower - compare the \"cost of credit.\" This means a lender takes the loan's interest rate and adds in any fixed dollar costs and fees that go into the cost of processing the loan. APR adds these amounts into the advertised rate, creating a new percentage of the amount borrowed. \nQuite often, people mistakenly think the APR is just the interest rate plus the \"closing costs.\" That's too simple of an explanation, and misses the point. APR only includes costs associated with the actual loan, not fees outside of the loan. You'll find that there are other costs like government transfer fees or other transaction fees paid at the time of closing, which are not part of the APR.\nThanks for watching.

Old, haggard bogans of the future are sure to look back and reminisce fondly about their first time seeing Soulseller; the band that saved Dunedin music from falling into a hackneyed spiral of repetition of the inescapable \"Dunedin Sound\". Their music is a pure distillation of their three parts, an expression imbued with artful innocence and integrity that could only issue forth from three characters like Damo, Jared and Hayden. The beard-clad, long-haired youngsters show a refined sensibility for riff-worship and bluesy, unadulterated emotion well beyond their years, channelling the spirits of 70s fuzz and psychedelia, reified with youthful aggression and wide-eyed experimentation; the soundtrack to punching, driving trucks, beards, leather, denim and manhood.\n\nTheir music (delivered in the form of a ripper of an EP (self-titled) and a glorious fuckfest of a live show) showcases pure rock n' roll fury with wild abandon, tearing a new one in the seat of your pants, barely hinged together in the frenzy of it all; but all converging with a supernatural focus, with great discipline and honorable respect for the one, the unholy awesome bastard of a riff - the kind that induces involuntary head movements, ordering a hand to your crotch and a fist to the air, air-guitaring and spilling beer all over your friends.\n\nTheir newer songs logically develop and extend from their foundations in the time-tested Soulseller formula, but hint at a maturity and intensity beyond that of their EP, which in itself is one of New Zealand underground rock music's greatest releases and easily one of the best debut records of any kind in recent years.\n\nSerious fans of stoner rock, psychedelia and straight-up rock and roll would do well to keep an eye on Soulseller. - John Strange, 2010''", "title": "Soulseller - Dead in the Water", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T06:40:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6N3uhoeDr38", "description": "This educational video explains the steps you need to take to protect yourself, loved ones, and property in the unfortunate event of incapacitation.

We wanted to find out whether there is a physical connection between those two organelles. Therefore we decided to use laser-based \"optical tweezers\" to pull at Golgi bodies and see whether the ER would follow, or if they would rip off.\n\nFor this experiment we used different coloured fluorescent proteins to make the Golgi bodies and the ER visible in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We then took our plants to Wageningen University in The Netherlands, where they have a confocal laser scanning microscope connected to a laser micromanipulation system.\n\nIn order to grab Golgi bodies, we took small Arabidopsis seedlings, put them on the microscope and then used a laser beam to optically trap and move them around. As you can see in the video, we managed to show that indeed there is a physical connection between Golgi bodies and the ER, which was very exciting.

We also take a look at the ACC teams who have advanced to the Women's NCAA Tournament\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University.

After more than two months of deepening antagonism over Ukraine, he now appears to think it is time for a truce, and - if possible - a return to business as usual.\nTAGS\nabc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "BREAKING NEWS: Vladimir Putin condemns Prince Charles's 'Nazi' remarks", "publishedDate": "2014-10-19T01:49:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NBGKSfPguw", "description": "This video shows before and after treatment of Dupuytren's contracture of the right hand using Xiaflex as performed by Dr. Kenty Sian.", "title": "Dupuytren's Contracture Before & After Xiaflex Treatment Video #1 (Dr. Kenty Sian)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-05T19:48:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NBRZ1ZUzBQ", "description": "And now for the big reveal: Build.VERSION_CODES.L...", "title": "Android L: Licorice?

It is the third game in the Borderlands series, serving as an interquel between the original Borderlands released in 2009 and its 2012 sequel Borderlands 2. It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux/Steam OS, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 14 October 2014. The rumored existence of the game was first reported on 7 April 2014, and it was officially announced two days later on 9 April 2014.\n\nSimilarly to previous Borderlands titles, the game combines FPS gameplay with mechanics common to role-playing video games (such as quests, character building and randomly generated \"loot\"), and collaborative multiplayer campaign gameplay. The storyline of The Pre-Sequel focus on four playable characters\u2014all of whom were NPCs or enemies in previous Borderlands games, working as henchmen for Handsome Jack, the antagonist of Borderlands 2. The plot follows Handsome Jack's descent into villainy, focusing on his escape and capture of the Hyperion company's base on Pandora's moon Elpis. The game expands upon the engine and gameplay of Borderlands 2 and introduced new gameplay mechanics, including low-gravity environments, freeze weapons, and oxygen tanks which are used to navigate environments and perform special attacks.\n\nThe Pre-Sequel received mixed to positive reviews; while praised for its new gameplay features, maintaining the trademark humour of previous entries in the Borderlands series, and for appealing to long-time fans of the franchise, the game was characterized by some as an expansion pack for Borderlands 2 that did not provide many significant deviations from the core mechanics of its predecessor.", "title": "Borderlands The Pre-Sequel Handsome Jack Doppelganger Pack Release Date Revealed At PAX Australia!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T01:43:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NChGO4tJGU", "description": "Symphylans have been recently detected causing establishment problems in cotton on the Darling Downs", "title": "Symphyla", "publishedDate": "2013-11-15T02:00:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NClPBpofnA", "description": "Integrante:\nYeison Andres Rondon Hincapie.\nMateo Acevedo Bustamante.\nTatiana Moreno Aricapa.\nKelly Juliana Salazar Osorio.", "title": "Preparaci\u00f3n de una soluci\u00f3n molal.", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T21:05:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NDddEZnpOQ", "description": "SUBSCRIBE for daily car videos! http://vid.io/xkQ\nHyundai Unveils New Gamma 1.6L GDI Engine", "title": "Hyundai Unveils New Gamma 1.6L GDI Engine", "publishedDate": "2010-05-02T23:52:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NDjZ2_hwT4", "description": "Alger manifestation CNCD non autoris\u00e9e du Conseil National pour le Changement et la D\u00e9mocratie", "title": "Alger manifestation CNCD 26/02/2011", "publishedDate": "2011-02-26T11:28:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NEDNysTab4", "description": "Using the Tul ammo steel case out of my Saiga.", "title": "Saiga break-in with Tul steel case ammo. 7.62x39", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T14:27:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NEZDQdRvjM", "description": "Voyez les effets de la cataire (catnip) sur Lolotte !", "title": "Herbe \u00e0 chat (cataire)", "publishedDate": "2007-06-20T07:52:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NEdxVvu2Y4", "description": "", "title": "\u0e22\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e1f  \u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21 Vosups", "publishedDate": "2011-09-11T12:22:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NEfxYCaQ7I", "description": "How to easily sharpen your saw using the Veritas Handsaw File Holder.

The best humor commercials leave you with a chuckle, but firmly tie that humor back to the product and its features.  \n\nIn this three-minute emotional marketing lesson video, emotional marketing expert Graeme Newell shows how the best humorous advertisements avoid the mistake of being \"funny for the sake of being funny.\"\n\nAs ad writers, creating the funniest commercials around isn't always a top priority. While it often gets put on the back-burner, good advertising humor can endear the viewer to your product, and some of the best television ads are humor commercials. But what if I told you that humor in advertising can be easy and effective. Today I'm gonna tell you how to make humorous advertisements that move product.\nHumor Commercials for the Sake of Being Funny\nToo often humor in advertising loses track of its initial purpose. All humorous advertisements exist to not only entertain the viewer, but to also sell a product. You can be making the funniest commercials in history, but if the viewer never associates it with your product, it's all for nothing. The key to humor commercials is that they must some double-duty with the humor. Commercials that are immensely entertaining are wonderful, but they must also sell a product.\nAdvertising Humor with a Purpose\nSo when we look at the best television ads that use advertising humor, we discover that there is always a motivation and a message behind the humor commercials. When making humorous advertisements you have to make it an integrated approach. Too often humorous advertisements are made with the product pitch in mind, and then the humor is just added on as an afterthought. Or sometimes the ad is made just as a humorous advertisement, and it feels like the product pitch is just tagged on to the end as an aside. Instead, the funniest commercials and best television ads are considering both of these aspects from start to finish. Advertising humor is just that -- humor that is to be used effectively in a humorous advertisement.\nHumor in Advertising\nWhen going about making humorous advertisements, there are many different approaches you can take. Instead of just aimlessly going for the nebulous idea of \"funny,\" try to go at it from an emotional marketing approach. Instead of making cheap jokes, humor in advertising is a deliberate procedure. Spoof is a fantastic approach that many of the funniest commercials around use. Take a well-known fixture of popular culture, and lampoon it. It will establish a connection with the customer and then fulfil you side of the bargain by entertaining them. Once they are entertained, they will happily listen to your product pitch. You can also go the approach of absurd next step. In this creative vehicle, you take a common situation and flip it on its ear. The more mundane, the more extreme the flip.\nSo, let's recap what was covered here:\n\u2022 Way too often advertisers pass over humorous advertisements. They think that humor in advertising is too difficult to effectively do and they either do not bother, or they add it as an afterthought.\n\u2022 Humorous advertisements are great vehicles for delivering a message. They endear the customer to you with the entertainment, and make the message memorable by pairing it with the humor\n\u2022 Two great ways to deliver the message is to either utilize the parody or absurd next step creative vehicles", "title": "Funniest Commercials: Humor in Advertising & Humor Commercials", "publishedDate": "2013-03-26T19:07:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NTw_qwjPv0", "description": "\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc3DS\u7528SRPG\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc2 \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u300d\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u8feb\u771f \u7434\uff08\u30de\u30b3\u30c8\uff09\uff0fCV:\u6ca2\u57ce\u307f\u3086\u304d\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n2015\u5e741\u670829\u65e5\u767a\u58f2\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\n\u8a73\u3057\u304f\u306f\u30b3\u30c1\u30e9\u3000http://ds2-p.atlusnet.jp/", "title": "\u3010\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc2 BR\u3011\u30de\u30b3\u30c8", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T07:49:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NU-6nDZlD0", "description": "Highlights from the final match between Robin Soderling (SWE) vs Andy Roddick (USA) at the 2011 Brisbane International.", "title": "Brisbane International: Soderling vs Roddick Highlights", "publishedDate": "2011-01-09T05:48:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NUDnviFBJ8", "description": "un gratuito atto di violenza.\ndirector: Capitan Ignoto\nMusic and Action: (b)ananartista orgasmo SBUFF\nwww.bananartista.com\n\nWatermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.), family Cucurbitaceae) is a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) flowering plant originally from southern Africa.

Lorne's brother, Wyatt can be seen at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. Lorne is being raised with the hope of using him in educational talks to raise awareness for an often misunderstood animal. Despite media attention that wolves in the wild have stabilized their numbers, they are still very much at risk. Wolf hunting continues to persist, both legally and illegally. Wolves are still stigmatized in society, especially by farmers and ranchers who if merely seeing a wolf will on sight, no matter the threat. This mentality is hurting our intelligent friend, whose relationship and companionship led us to the domesticated dog we have today and love. Lorne visits with the public regularly and even though he's just a cub, he has instantly charmed his way into the hearts of many others who before misunderstood and feared one of our closest ties to the natural world.\n\nLorne is a subspecies of the Grey (or Timber) Wolf. He was born in April (wolves are only born in the spring, unlike domesticated dogs) and until he came to me just shy of 7 weeks was used in meet-and-greets at the Georgia zoo. In July he went on a trip across the United States from out West to Chicago. Unfortunately once there, he swallowed a small slip lead and had to have a life threatening surgery to remove it. His recovery was remarkable and the vet that preformed the surgery said it was the fastest she had ever seen. Wolves are strong and very adaptable. Their immune system due to their varied gene pool and lack of interbreeding as seen in domesticated dogs, makes them lack the health problems they often do. It was a scary time, but thankfully today you wouldn't even know it ever happened (except for the constant reminder of paying off the bill!). \n\nI'm working with Lorne every day and I hope that he is able to continue to reach out to the public as he matures. It is common that wolves once establishing a territory upon reaching adulthood have trouble leaving it and feel much more comfortable at home than in strange places. We will see what path Lorne wants to follow in life, but I hope that he will be kind enough to continue to make a positive impression on others and be an ambassador for his species.\n\nIf you have a problem with wolves harming your livestock, please look into obtaining a quality livestock guardian dogs from working lines. This is the humane way to keep wolves and other predators at bay. Altercations between guardian dogs and wolves typically result in the dogs running the wolf or wolves off your land and away from your livestock. Shooting on sight is unnecessary and should only be used in situations where it is a last resort to protect your animals. Shooting for sport, isn't a sport. It's just murder. Please respect the wolf and his place on our planet.\n\nYou can see Lorne's other videos by checking out his playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW_CpthVZVQ&list=PL7CQVvLqPwpqe4UTSvzWdTQmOG8eq6hy2\n\nYou can send Lorne and the dogs a gift by visiting: http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/14RKCEYEMWH1Z/ref=cm_sw_su_w\n\nAll gifts will be donated directly to the animals, no matter how small or what it is, it's appreciated. Donations allow me to continue to spend more time working with the animals in training and in public, participating in rescue work and fostering, and working on videos to help educate a wider audience about often misunderstood animals. Minks, ostriches, camels, wolves, everything- they are all our friends and deserve a peaceful life.\n\nThank you for watching.\n\nhttp://www.camelsandfriends.com", "title": "Wolf puppy keeps up with Doberman & Anatolian - it's not easy!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T02:08:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NZlvD35x8o", "description": "China Earthquake 2014 : Yunnan Earthquake 6.5 MG Caught On CCTV\nChina Earthquake 2014 : Yunnan Earthquake 6.5 MG Caught On CCTV\nChina Earthquake 2014 : Yunnan Earthquake 6.5 MG Caught On CCTV\n\nDeadly earthquake in Ludian county (Yunnan), China\nDeadly earthquake in Ludian county (Yunnan), China \u2013 at least 120 people killed and 180 people missing\nEarthquake in China kills at least 26\nStrong Quake Kills at Least 34 in Southern China\nEarthquake 'kills 26' in China\nDozens killed in China earthquake\nSouthwest China Quake Kills At Least 26\nStrong quake kills at least 26 in south-west China\nStrong 6.5-Magnitude Earthquake Kills At Least 26 in Southwest China\n26 dead, 79 injured in southwest China quake\n6.1-magnitude quake kills at least 26 in southwest ChinaEarthquake 'kills 26' in south-west China\n26 dead, 79 injured in southwest China quake\n6.1-magnitude quake kills at least 26 in southwest China\nStrong quake kills at least 26 in southwest China\nStrong quake kills at least 26 in southwest China\nStrong earthquake kills at least 26, injures 79 in southwest ...\nStrong quake kills at least 26 in southwest China\nChina quake: Deaths reported\nAt Least 150 Killed After Strong Earthquake Strikes China: State Media\nMagnitude 6.1 earthquake kills dozens in China\nAt least 150 dead after quake hits southwest China\n6.1-magnitude quake kills at least 26 in southwest China\n150 dead as massive earthquake hits China\nEarthquake Kills at Least 150 in China\nDeath toll in southwest China quake reaches at least 150\nStrong 6.1 quake hits southwest China \u2013 USGS\nStrong earthquake hits China's Yunnan province, at least 150 killed\nSouth-west China quake 'kills 150'\nMajor 6.1 EARTHQUAKE just struck CHINA 8.3.14\nTHAT MAY AFFECT YOU - - NEWS ARTICLES ...\nEarthquake in south-west China Kills 26 people 2014\nEarthquake in south-west China Earthquake in south-west China Earthquake in south-west China Earthquake in south-west ...\nChina Earthquake: At Least 150 People Dead (CAUGHT ON CAMERA)\nAt least 150 people have been killed and 79 injured by an earthquake in southwest China.

With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish (Jason Statham, who also supplies the film's voice-over narration) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), who join up with Mickey (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top (Alan Ford). In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia), who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol (Lennie James), the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi (Dennis Farina), freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York.\n\nsnatch.,\"snatch. clip\",\"benicio del toro\",\"lennie james\",\"robbie gee\",ade,\"guy ritchie\",\"dog videos\",\"toy videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime thrillers\",\"dark humor black comedies\",\"heist films\",mobster,\"united kingdom\",\"steve tisch\",\"matthew vaughn\",\"michael dreyer\",\"trudie styler\",\"peter morton\",\"angad paul\",\"sebastian pearson\",\"taha ali reza\",\"mistakes videos\",\"car videos\",sol,tyrone,vinny,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++220951,/m/04f1zjp,/m/01qscs,/m/034jts,/m/034js0", "title": "Squeaky Dog - Snatch.

Bolitoc, Sta. Cruz, Zambales. \n\nA3 UNA is a holder of a small-scale mining permit and, as such, is only allowed to extract not more than 50,000 metric tons of nickel ore annually. But considering its stockpile of 200,000 metric tons and another 45,000 metric tons shipped out last month, the firm is highly believed to have engaged in over-extraction and violated the law. \n\n \n\nAtienza went to Zambales this morning to inspect the \"hot\" nickel ore. After seeing the \"mountain\" of minerals ready to be shipped out, he said that, \"it is very evident that heavy equipment and trucks were used. It is clear that A3 UNA violated the conditions of its mining permit.\" \n\nHe said the kind of mining operations that A3 UNA had engaged in is an example of abuse committed by a small-scale mining permit holder. \"We will not tolerate other similar and further abuses,\" Atienza said. \"Compliance with the law ensures beneficial effects of mining to many while abuse of the law is detrimental to the many and benefits only the few. \n\nZambales congressman Tony Diaz, who joined Atienza in the inspection visit, charged that the trucks hauling the nickel ore from the mine site to the shipment point are overloaded and destroy the roads in the area. Sta, Cruz mayor Luisito Marty complained of not having received a single centavo of the town's share from the profits of A3 UNA. \n\nAtienza urged local officials, like Marty, to monitor the operations of mining firms and ensure their compliance to environmental laws and their share of proceeds from mining activities. \n\nThe nickel ore at A3 UNA'S private pier was earlier placed under seizure on February 8 by the DENR pending submission by A3 UNA Corp. of documents such as ore transport permits (OTPs), mining permits, operating agreements or any document that would prove that the said nickel ore was legally sourced. \n\nThe seizure order partly stemmed from the complaints of four mining companies which alleged that A3 UNA had been mining in their permit areas without their consent, using small-scale mining permits issued by the local government. \n\nThe complainants were Zambales Chromite Mining Corp. (ZCMC), Eramen Minerals, Inc., Benguet Corp., and Filipinas Mining Corp. (FMC). ZCMC, Eramen and Benguet Corp. have valid and existing Mineral Production Sharing Agreements (MPSAs) in Sta. Cruz issued by the DENR. FMC, on the other hand, has prior right over the area by virtue of a pending MPSA application at the DENR. \n\nSection 53 of Republic Act No. 7942 or the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 requires the issuance of an Ore Transport Permit or OTP for the transport of non-processed mineral ores or minerals, the absence of which is considered a prima facie evidence of illegal mining and considered a sufficient cause for the government to confiscate the ores or minerals, including the tools, equipment and conveyance used in the commission of the offense.", "title": "DMCCI MINING CORP.

At speeds of almost 300,000 kilometers per second that gets you pretty far from home.\n\nSo take that distance and turn it into a cube, each side one light year in length. Imagine that giant volume of space, a little challenging for some of us to get our heads around. How much \"stuff\" would be in there, and not just \"stuff\"... how much nothing is in there? There is an answer, but it all depends on where put your giant cube. \n\nMeasure it at the core of the galaxy, and there are stars buzzing around all over the place. Perhaps in the heart of a globular cluster? In a star forming nebula? Or maybe out in the suburbs of the Milky Way? There's also great voids that exist between galaxies, where there's almost nothing.\n\nThere's no getting around the math in this one. First, let's figure out an average density for the Milky Way and then go from there. Its about 100,000 light-years across and 1000 light-years thick. According to my buddy Phil Plait, the total volume of the Milky Way is about 8 trillion cubic light-years. And the total mass of the Milky Way is 6 x 10 to the power of 42 kilograms.\n\nDivide those together and you get 8 x 10 to the power of 29 kilograms per light year. That's an 8 followed by 29 zeros. Is that a lot? It sounds like a lot. \n\nActually, that's about 40% of the mass of the Sun. In other words, on average, across the Milky Way, there's about 40% the mass of the Sun in every cubic light year. But in an average cubic meter, there's only about 950 attograms. Almost a femtogram; a quadrillionth of a gram of matter. Which is pretty close to nothing. Seriously, air has more than a kilogram of mass per cubic meter.\n\nIn the densest regions of the Milky Way, like inside globular clusters, you can get densities of stars with 100, or even 1000 times greater than our region of the galaxy. Stars can get as close together as the radius of the Solar System. \n\nBut out in the vast interstellar gulfs between stars, the density drops significantly. There are only a few hundred individual atoms per cubic meter in interstellar space. And in the intergalactic voids; the gulfs between galaxies, there are just a handful of atoms per meter. \n\nHow much stuff is there in a light year? It all depends on where you look, but if you spread all the matter around by shaking the Universe up like a snow globe, the answer is very close to nothing.", "title": "How Much Stuff Is In A Light Year?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T18:57:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6NzFsT9ilME", "description": "Un incontro importante che ha lo scopo di aiutarci a riflettere su un tema molto importante per la societ\u00e0.

What is subrogation?  Subrogation is a fancy word for when the health insurance company, which pays out for medical expenses, has the right to get reimbursed out of any personal injury claim. To get this right, they have to have this in the health insurance contract. You have to look at this contract to determine how strong this right to reimbursement is in your health insurance contract. Some are very strong, like if your plan is the federally funded ERISA plan. The right of reimbursement is real and it should not be ignored. So if you receive a letter from one of your health insurance carriers or someone they hire, like Ingenix, it's something you need to turnover to your personal injury attorney and let them deal with. That's because at the end of a personal injury claim paying back the health insurance carrier has to be taken into account.", "title": "What is Subrogation?", "publishedDate": "2011-11-18T19:59:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6O3p1-EjbWw", "description": "[Eng Sub] 140809 Bomi - Human Condition (Who is the prettiest)", "title": "[Eng Sub] 140809 Bomi - Human Condition (Who is the prettiest)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-10T05:58:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6O3wwCu40AI", "description": "Kent White, Instrumental Music Specialist at Stanton's Sheet Music, presents \"Ragged Rozey\" by Karl L.

This time out Annie Clark was to combine her long-celebrated musical virtuosity with ambitious songwriting that ran a gamut of emotional cadences, all the while underpinned by a colourful sense of melody.\n\nRecording these songs live for the first time, St Vincent has performed four tracks from Strange Mercy for the tenth visual installment in the 4AD Session series. Shot at Shangri-La Studios in the heart of the Brooklyn film and photography district in Greenpoint, the session was recorded with Annie's new band, Daniel Mintseris (keys), Toko Yasuda (moog) and Matthew Johnson (drums). Given St Vincent's transgression from the underground to the pop spotlight over the course of three studio albums, it's somewhat fitting that Shangri-La host the session having initially earned its name as a secret spot known only through word of mouth.\n\nAs with all of the sessions in the series, directors Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard filmed the four tracks with a clear artistic vision. In this instance, the inspiration came from an unlikely source -- the memory of seeing a 1968 Shirley Bassey performance of 'This is My Life' on Rai Uno for Italian TV. With that reference point in mind, Annie takes centre stage against the backdrop of a projected live-feed, resplendent in glamorous eye make-up and with her always-impressive guitar work brought clearly to the fore. More interestingly still, the classic showbusiness styling of the session is held in stark contrast to the affecting and darkly-tinged emotional undertones of 'Chloe In The Afternoon' and 'Surgeon', representing perfectly the themes that run throughout Strange Mercy.", "title": "St Vincent - Cheerleader (4AD Session)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T18:11:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6OBhyd57iqM", "description": "Cheektowaga Central\nSpanish 3\nNatalie McGill\nJessie Cecere\nLan Le", "title": "Spanish Verbs- Preterit and Imperfect Rap", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T02:31:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6OCFwv5Jgvw", "description": "Peazo de mate de Guille a pase de Sotoooooo xDDD", "title": "Mate estratosferico de Guille a pase de Soto CD Smilo", "publishedDate": "2009-03-21T13:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6OCVgy9k0II", "description": "Giant Brand Solutions Leading Service provider located in Coimbatore Exhibition Stall Designing, Events Booth Designing, 3D Stall Designing, Creative Designing Solutions, Fabrication Of Wooden Platforms, Corporate Films, Advertisement Films, Documentary Films, Photoshoots\nfor more detail pls. visit  http://www.99business.com/giant-brandsolutions", "title": "Giant Brand Solutions Coimbatore Exhibition Stall Designing", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T08:26:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6OCVirAqHmE", "description": "Hawaii's John Martin explains the Human Design System and what it means to have 'open centers'.

Both agree that the following three characteristics are strong clues that a religion was not created by an Infallible Wisdom, but just made up by quite fallible humans: (1) when a religion a cluelessness about the layout of the universe (its stories describe stars as tiny, the moon as a light, the earth as flat, the sun as orbiting our planet, etc.) (2) it contains laws that are barbaric and reflect senseless prejudices (3) history reveals that the religion was pieced together from ideas and stories from pre-existing religions\n\n5 of 7: the skeptic and the Christian read through the Judeo-Christian Bible, and examine it by the same critical light just held up to non-Christian religions.\n\n5.1 through 5.5: Further details on the origins of the Judeo-Christian bible--how many of its ideas & stories can be found in religions that pre-date the bible by centuries.\n\n5.1 explains why many of the baffling details within the tale of Noah & the Ark make sense once the story is read as a monotheistic version (in which God is said to be Omniscient, Omnipotent, and Benevolent) of a story that was originally polytheistic (in which the gods were none of the above).\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9fxvJy9swk&feature=channel_page\n\n5.2 discusses the pre-Christian religious stories from the Greeks, Romans, and Zoroastrians about unions between gods & mortals, miraculous virgin births, and offspring that were both human and god. It also covers the \"Satanic pre-plagiarization\" explanations from early Church Fathers Justin Martyr and Tertullian on how the pagans knew about these phenomena centuries before the time of Jesus.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ymGDRZfOQ&feature=channel_page\n\n5.3: Richard Dawkins refers to the Christian premises behind the belief that Jesus/God sacrificed Himself to appease Himself as \"barking mad.\" This video looks at each of those premises--Divine Anger, the need for sacrifice, the use of a scapegoat--from the perspective of comparative mythology. The subtitle for this video is \"Richard Dawkins meets Joseph Campbell.\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDJ-azGoBt8&feature=channel\n\n5.4: the evolution of the afterlife. Stage One - the 37 out of 39 Old Testament books that either don't mention, or even deny, an afterlife. Stage Two - the 2 Old Testament books that say there IS an afterlife.

To access the stone ruins, the entire crew of 15 people had to traipse through the woods at night with all our gear - crossing rickety bridges and climbing uneven terrain.  Our official trail guide was a trooper and stayed with us the entire night, swinging in a tree hammock.  We didn't finish shooting until 5:00 am, but it was a total blast.  It was eerily serene watching the sun rise as we drove back to Atlanta that morning...\n\nThe next night, we filmed all the underwater footage at a residential pool.  Diving in for repeated takes with my full outfit (boots included!) was an amusing challenge, and we almost drowned a couple of times\u2026 but all in the name of art!

Previously featured on Silk Sofa with remixes from Stray Theories and State Azure, \"Unsaid\" features captivating arpeggio lines in numerous layers, as well as a breath-taking breakbeat. \"Hypnotized\" includes a unique combination of light bell-inspired sounds, well-structured string lines, and soft percussion elements that establish an enjoyable groove. The fourth song is \"Close Your Eyes\", which starts off with mesmerizing sweeping pad effects, as well as a unique, subtle lead on top. Later, an energetic lead makes its entrance, supported with additional sound effects. \"Stars\" is introduced by a lush, deep bassline, as well as an array of well-crafted arpeggio stabs. Throughout the song, the listener is presented with a truly hypnotizing soundscape with constantly changing and inspiring elements. Rounding out the first half of the album, \"Superstring Theory\" begins with a soothing atmosphere including a unique main lead, which is later supported by a piano sound on top. The background stabs subsequently develop into an energetic structure in the climax of the track.\n\nA dark, hypnotizing atmosphere is quickly introduced in \"Light Realm\", and the listener is presented with numerous interesting sound effects in this interlude. Soothing pad lines introduce \"Planet Earth\", in which a delightful piano melody emerges later. Sparkling sound effects and subtle percussion elements provide additional texture later. \"Gravitational Force\" consists of a truly hypnotizing soundscape, including a vast array of well-structured arpeggio lines and striking sound effects in the background. A blissful breakbeat is showcased in \"Watch The Sunrise\", in which Puremusic's trademark arpeggio lines are also introduced, brilliantly supported by a subtle piano line on top. \"The Great\" begins with mesmerizing stabs and an enjoyable breakbeat. As the song progresses, the arpeggio leads become more energetic, blissfully supported by a light lead in the background. Rounding out the second half of the album, \"The Music & The Universe\" takes the listener on a joyful ride through Puremusic's signature sound universe.

Only 2,000 people live in the closest town.\n\nDubbed \"the Doomsday seed vault\", the facility is carved into the permafrost of a mountain at about 130 metres above sea level, an attitude that protects the vault from climate change. It will remain dry even if the surrounding ice caps melt. \n\nThe seed bank can act as a beacon, as it is fitted with light installations. The roof and entrance are paved with highly reflective steel, mirrors and prisms. In summer months, the polar lights are reflected; optic cables radiate turquoise and white lights during winter.\n\nConnected to the entrance with a 93.3 metre-long tunnel, the Svalbard Global Seed Bank consists of three vaults.The temperature is maintained at minus 18 degrees Celsius in the storage area.\n\nFive hundred seeds of each variety are placed in special four-play packages, which are vacuum and heat-sealed. The envelopes are then placed inside black boxes, which are put on shelves inside each vault. \n\nAbout 820,000 plant seed samples from around the world are now deposited in the seed bank.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

There is a distinct regional pattern of right ventricular dysfunction, with akinesia of the mid free wall but normal motion at the apex. \n\nThree mechanisms have been proposed that may explain these findings. \n\nFirst, in acute PE, the tethering of the right ventricular apex to a contracting and often hyperdynamic left ventricle may account for the preserved wall motion at the apex.\n\nSecond, the right ventricle may be assuming a more spherical shape to equalize regional wall stress when subjected to an abrupt increase in afterload.\n\nThird, there may be localized ischemia of the right ventricular free wall as a result of increased wall stress. \n\nOverall, echocardiography has a low sensitivity for diagnosing PE; however, the accuracy is much higher in the diagnosis of massive PE. Echocardiography may be useful in cases of massive PE in which a rapid presumptive diagnosis is required to justify the use of thrombolytic therapy.

The worst part is, I'm starting to develop feelings for him but I'm scared to let my guard down, how do I know whether or not he feels the same way?\n\nAh, so he wants the sex, but he doesn't want to make it complex. \nMen feel stuff, too OK. The hars reality is though that men can have sex with a girl with literally ZERO emotional connection\n(Rip a shot, turn around, who wants to bone).\nWe're pigs, I get it.\nBut it does make sense. Evolutionarily, Men are designed to spread their seed with as many women as possible to have as many offspring as possible. While women have very limited resources. Sex means more to you, because historically, AKA pre-condoms, (black and white - what the hell is this thing) it MEANT more to you, AKA getting preggers (Pillow in my stock \"what the hell is this thing?). \nSo if you're looking for more than a just hook up (Wig, rip a shot, who wants to bone?), you're probably trying to figure out whether or not a dude is just trying to bone or if he's  also feeling emotionally connected.\nNow here are the signs he's emotionally connected (aka likes you more than just in the sack)\n\n * \nHe'll introduce you to his friends\n\n * \nHe's willing to hang out with you during the day\n\n * \nHe'll talk on the phone for extended periods of time \n\n * He'll do something more on a second/third date than just \"go out for drinks\"\n * \nHe is just generally willing to hang out without sex always being at the forefront of the activity\n\n\nBut beyond those things, there's one thing you need to realize - Actions speak louder than words. What he DOES means so much more than what he says\nIf he keeps telling you that he likes you, but won't actually act on it, ask him simply \"Should I be dating other people?\" He'll be forced to come respond. And if it's not the response your looking for, then move on.\nActually move on! If you don't stick to the boundaries you've laid out for him, then he'll never follow them anyways.\n\nFor similar videos, please search youtube for:\n\n\"attracting a man emotionally,\n\"emotional attraction,\n\"emotional attraction for men,\n\"emotional attraction men\"\n\"emotional attraction with a man\"\n\"men emotional attraction\"\n\"physical and emotional attraction\"\n\"physical attraction vs emotional attraction\"\n\"physical attraction vs mental attraction\"\n\"psychological signs of attraction\"\n\"signs of attraction\"\n\"signs of emotional attraction in men\"\n\"signs that he is attracted to you\"\n\"what men are attracted to\"", "title": "5 Signs of \"Emotional Attraction From Men\" (Versus Physical Attraction)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-18T14:30:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6PPJ-tSk-4U", "description": "I show you in this video how to build a simple yet effective doorbell in minecraft!\nWITH THE POWER OF REDSTONE!\n\nignore:Minecraft puzzle map game custom map multiplayer games planetoids funny part 1 part 2 minecraft survival bluexephos yogscast filler until next season of good videos alpha Alpha notch spider spiders skeleton skeletons zombie zombies lumber wood coal stone torch torches workbench crafting square pickaxe pick wooden shelter nighttime daytime night day yt:quality=high machinima video games davidr64yt davidangel64", "title": "How to make a Doorbell in Minecraft", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T17:47:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6PPcodUeGaU", "description": "Los teraf\u00f3sidos (Theraphosidae, del griego thera \"animal salvaje, bestia\" + phos \"luz\") son una familia de ara\u00f1as migalomorfas propias de los pa\u00edses tropicales.

This performance makes use of Physical Theatre to emphasise the emotions and ideas that are represented in the text of the Play.\nSynopsis\nNineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell is a 1949 English novel about life under a futuristic authoritarian regime in the year 1984. It tells the story of Winston Smith, a functionary at the Ministry of Truth, whose work consists of editing historical accounts to fit the government's policies. Smith is degraded and tortured after he is arrested by the Thought Police under the instruction of the totalitarian government of Oceania.\nThe intellectual Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party, lives in the ruins of London (the \"chief city of Airstrip One\", a province of Oceania), who grew up in the post-World War II United Kingdom, during the revolution and the civil war. As his parents disappeared in the civil war, the English Socialism Movement (\"Ingsoc\" in Newspeak), put him in an orphanage for training and employment in the Outer Party.\nOne day in the office, a woman surreptitiously hands him a note. She is \"Julia\", a dark-haired mechanic who repairs the Ministry of Truth's novel-writing machines. Before that day, he had felt deep loathing for her, based on his assumptions that she was a brainwashed, fanatically devoted member of the Party; particularly annoying to him is her red sash of renouncement of and scorn for sexual intercourse. His preconceptions vanish on reading her hand-printed note: \"I love you\". After that, they begin a clandestine romantic relationship, first meeting in the countryside and at a ruined belfry, then regularly in a rented room atop an antiques shop in the city's proletarian neighbourhood. The shop owner chats him up with facts about the pre-revolutionary past, sells him period artifacts, and rents him the room to meet Julia. The lovers believe their hiding place paradisiacal (the shop keeper having told them it has no telescreen) and think themselves alone and safe.\nAs their romance deepens, Winston's views change, and questions Ingsoc.

That is, this represents the basic classic view you should be trying to 'discover' or 'decipher' as you view the ultrasound image of your scan. There are 3 layers (4, really but I'll get to that later) that you should be trying to identify to find the nerve. Superficial to deep, they are: Skin & Subcutaneous tissue; 2 (or 3 - BF,ST & SM) Hamstring Muscles (that lay over the sciatic nerve like the roof of a house); the Sciatic Nerve. The sciatic nerve is usually seen pushed up against the underside of the muscles. When you scan, look expectantly for these 3 layers, and keep this basic 'archetypal view' in mind. The fourth layer would be the Popliteal Artery & Vein which appear as you scan distally.\n\nSLIDE 2: This slide (which is actually a video that has been uploaded recently) gives more detail about what to expect as we scan distally. These points on the slide should be in your mind as you scan and 'expectantly' recognize the structures and their characteristic locations and movements. Note that the sciatic nerve is 'artificially' moved to the right in the slide by local anesthetic as it is a post-injection view. \n\nSLIDE 3: This slide is a 'tag-along' with the prior video to demonstrate well the appearance of the splitting of the Tibial & Common Peroneal nerve. It is (of course) distal the the previous slide and demonstrates -as a slide, the difference in arrangement of the nerve and the surrounding structures. The nerve is well-seen due to the addition of local anesthetic.\n\nSLIDES 4-6: Just read the captions which detail various points and tips for for performing this nerve block. Unfortunately, the 'animations' of the individual slides can not be added (at least not by me), so something will be lost in translation, but there are several helpful points on these slides.", "title": "Popliteal Nerve Block Animation and Tips.wmv", "publishedDate": "2012-01-04T19:26:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6PaF0iOcmsU", "description": "", "title": "The Dukedom Detroit Family Choir", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T01:58:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6PaFj9MmqYo", "description": "Cowpea bruchids (Callosobruchus maculatus) can cause significant damage to cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seeds in storage. Instead of using chemical pesticides to control these bruchids, this animation shows the use of hermetic sealing of plastic bags (triple bagging) to minimize pest damage over long-term (multiple months) storage of the cowpea seeds. This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage. This approach can be potentially used for other stored product pests.", "title": "Triple Bagging of Cowpea Seeds in English (accent from Nigeria) (Moon version)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-03T16:58:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6PaJdzK-gZU", "description": "Hey guys!

The Book of Proverbs is a collection of moral and religious teachings, mostly in the form of short sayings, dealing with everyday concerns, including good manners and common sense. Much of the advice in Proverbs is still relevant to us today.\nCall out for insight and cry aloud for understanding (Proverbs 2:3). Then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God (Proverbs 2:5). For the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth come knowledge and understanding (Proverbs 2:6). He holds victory in store for the upright, He is a shield to those whose walk is blameless (Proverbs 2:7). For He guards the course of the just and protects the way of His faithful ones (Proverbs 2:8). Then you will understand what is right and just and fair, every good path (Proverbs 2:9). For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul (Proverbs 2:10). Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you (Proverbs 2:11). Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse (Proverbs 2:12). Men who leave straight paths to walk in dark ways (Proverbs 2:13). Men who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil (Proverbs 2:14). So walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous (Proverbs 2:20). For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it (Proverbs 2:21). But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it (Proverbs 2:22).\nThought for today: trust in God today and prepare for your tomorrow.\nThought for the future: a Christian's inheritance is guaranteed forever.

This was preceded by headaches, nausea, transient diplopia, 3rd cranial nerve palsy and gait imbalance since six months. On admission the right eye had a normal visual acuity and visual fields. Unfortunately, the vision decreased to counting fingers and she developed an altitudinal scotoma. \nAmongst others, the MRI of the brain showed a pachymeningitis with compression of both intracanalicular optic nerves, resulting in a wide subarachnoid space around the infraorbital part. Further investigation prompted the diagnosis Wegener's granulomatosis and the patient was treated with high dose corticosteroids. This temporary improved her vision, only to decrease again after cessation of medication. With the eminent blindness of her only functional eye, surgical decompression of the right optic nerve over the course of the optic canal was performed via a pretemporal approach with anterior clinoidectomy. The dura was excised and histology confirmed the diagnosis morbus Wegener. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient's visual acuity on her right eye almost totally recovered, as well as the visual fields. Even after cessation of high-dose corticosteroids this remained the case.\nSurgery by: dr. R. Dammers and dr. I.

Supplementing your diet with digestive enzymes allows you to reduce the stress and inflammation placed on the stomach from processed foods and meals high in fat, sodium and calories. Although raw foods contain enzymes, most people do not have a raw food diet so they lack the enzymes needed to ensure fats, carbohydrates and proteins are efficiently broken down and nutrients absorbed.  Enzymes are a vital element in the human body.  When taking digestive enzymes with a meal, your body has the ability to break down the food into small substrates that can be utilized for energy production throughout the day. If you experience gas, bloating or occasional heartburn following meals then your body is not properly breaking down the foods you are eating.  When foods are not broken down small enough to digest, they become toxic in the body.  Implementing Innerzyme's Digestive Enzyme Complex before a meal will provide the support you need to naturally relieve these uncomfortable symptoms caused by undigested or partially digested foods.\n\n*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Rife discovered that viruses, bacteria, sick and healthy body tissue react to certain tones. In his laboratory he observed with a high performance microscope that diseases dissolve under selective sound radiation and body tissue gets healthier. The human body is approximately 73% water and the tones have positive effects on the information memory of this water molecules. This slight changing of the elements of life works similar to homeopathy as coding of the energy field of a person.\nWhat's special about the NRT is the use of the laboratory sounds of Dr. Rife as musical-harmonic titles. The video version contains additional color resonances, based on the latest findings of the light - and color research. Excited feedback of many people from around the world show the effectiveness of this method.\n\nApplication\nTry the free video samples and get the high-quality original titles on CD/DVD. You can use headphones or regular sound speakers. Good sound speakers may also increase the effect of the method. The sounds of the Nordwest Resonance Technique (NRT) may contain very low and very high tones, use moderate loudness.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nDie Nordwest Resonanz Technik (NRT) unterst\u00fctzt mit energetischen Klangschwingungen die Gesundheit.\nDer medizinische Forscher Dr. Royal R. Rife entdeckte, dass Viren, Bakterien, krankes und auch gesundes K\u00f6rpergewebe auf bestimmte T\u00f6ne reagieren. In seinem Labor beobachtete er mit einem Hochleistungsmikroskop, dass sich Krankheiten bei gezielter Klangbestrahlung aufl\u00f6sen und K\u00f6rpergewebe ges\u00fcnder wird. Der menschliche K\u00f6rper besteht ungef\u00e4hr zu 73 % aus Wasser und die Klangschwingungen wirken positiv auf den Informationsspeicher der Wassermolek\u00fcle. Diese geringe Ver\u00e4nderung der Bausteine des Lebens funktioniert \u00e4hnlich wie Hom\u00f6opathie, als Codierung des Energiefeldes einer Person.\nDas Besondere an der Nordwest Resonanz Technik ist die Verwendung der Laborkl\u00e4nge von Dr. Rife als musikalisch-harmonische Titel. Die Videoversion enth\u00e4lt zus\u00e4tzlich Farbresonanzen, basierend auf den neuesten Erkenntnissen der Licht- und Farbenforschung.

Solenum and Calycanthus must take the adventurous paths of finding their way back to one another, and as they do so, they will uncover the secrets their land has been hiding beneath a carefully constructed facade for centuries.\n\nAn underground war is taking place, kept hidden from the public eye by those called the Altors and Regius. Although unaware at first of what their involvement brings to the people of Zinc, Calycanthus Esquivel's close proximity to the Altors allows him to uncover parts of the truth, creating an important turning point that may just be the kick the Altors need to beat the Regius. But it is Solenum Everhart who will find the possible key that can lead to a peaceful future. Is Galax Kaminski an exception to the rule that says all Regius are cruel at the core? Will Solenum be able to show him that he may just be the example everyone needs in order to end the hidden turmoil?\n\nWhile Solenum and Calycanthus change the lives of so many, their new environments forces them to grow, come face to face with danger, death, family connections and just a touch of magic.
