Pentagon leaders say another year of reductions will have damaging effects on national security, while others welcome a new era of defense austerity. CFR Adjunct Senior Fellow Carla Anne Robbins offers three things to know about sequestration and defense spending.\n\n- More Room to Cut: Defense leaders have balked at a projected $500 billion budget cut over the next ten years, but Robbins notes that following the attacks on September 11, \"the Pentagon got everything\u2014and more\u2014that it asked for.\" Between 2001 and 2010, base defense spending grew by nearly half to $528 billion. In FY2013, it decreased to $498 billion, and if there is a sequester next year, the number is expected to drop another 21 billion. \"These cuts are no deeper than they were after the end of previous wars,\" she says, adding that it is a good time for \"a reevaluation of strategic priorities.\"\n\n- Fundamental Flaws: \"The [sequester] process is anything but rational,\" Robbins says, attributing a \"yearly game of political brinkmanship\" to the problem. Defense spending \"has always been captive to special interests and pandering,\" and the sequester has exacerbated the problem, she says.\n\n- New Strategies Needed: Robbins says the White House has precluded a healthy debate over defense spending by sticking with a losing strategy of \"just saying no\" to sequestration. With any luck, the next few months will offer the Obama administration and the military establishment the chance to move past the denial stage, she says. \"But politics and inertia make it unlikely.\"\n\nhttp://www.cfr.org/defense-budget/sequestration-defense-spending-three-things-know/p31925", "title": "Sequestration and Defense Spending: Three Things to Know", "publishedDate": "2013-11-22T16:33:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oGUEypDq1g", "description": "An explanation of the Illicit Conversion Fallacy in Categorical Logic (Fallacy February & 90 Second Philosophy).", "title": "Illicit Conversion (Categorical Logic Fallacy)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-25T14:05:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oGjmTm25YQ", "description": "http://www.e-ville.com/kannykat/5034-e72-russia-keyboard-secam-tv-java-dual-camera-with-flashlight-30-touch-screen-bar-phone.html", "title": "E72 Phone with cyrillic keyboard", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T08:46:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oGlCKhLW0U", "description": "We did this traditional USA's dance in school at our UN presentation :)\n\n Music: Cotton eye joe\n\nOctober 2011", "title": "Cotton eye joe dance", "publishedDate": "2011-11-12T03:02:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oGxA9A_VAg", "description": "Rapid Defence, Martial Arts Norwich. \nThe best thing to do if you find that your attacker has a knife, is to run.

If anything this film shows you how NOT to defend yourself against a knife attack.\n\nFind out more about Martial arts Norwich: http://rapid-defence.com/\n\nNothing can prepare you for the fear you will feel the first time you are faced with an armed attacker. The best self defence is to move out of the line of attack and get out of the situation as quickly as possible. \n\nThere are ways to train yourself to cope with this situation. The best way is to train with a professional who trains with weapons. This will give you a real experience that no DVD course can help you with.

Horsetail stems contain silicon crystals (i.e. sand) embedded in its tissue. This gritty texture gives it a common name of \"scouring rush\".\n\nSubmerged portions of all aquatic plants provide habitats for many micro and macro invertebrates. These invertebrates in turn are used as food by fish and other wildlife species (e.g. amphibians, reptiles, ducks, etc.).

The friends of a free Government cannot be too watchful, to overcome the dangerous tendency of the public mind to sacrifice to mere private convenience this powerful check upon the designs of ambitious men.\"\n\nAnother true American patriot, George Mason, said, \"Why should we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real and natural strength, destroyed? The general government ought, at the same time, to have some such power. But we need not give them power to abolish our militia.... They may effect the destruction of the militia, by rendering the service odious to the people themselves, by harassing them from one end of the continent to the other, and by keeping them under martial law.\"\n\nFounding Father Thomas Jefferson said, \"Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks.\"\n\nThis is why the global dictatorial elitists in charge of FEMA are afraid of freedom loving Godly Christian patriots who defend the U.S. Constitution. The global elitists behind FEMA's policies know that in order to subdue America they must first brainwash the general public by demonizing those who adhere to the U.S. Constitution. If these global tyrants can convince a significant number of Americans to disarm their fellow citizens they can then move in \"by substituting a regular army in the stead of a resort to the Militia\" and bring the people of our once free nation \"under martial law\" to implement their New World Order dictatorship!\n\nAMERICA's CHRISTIAN HERITAGE\nhttp://wordofgod.0catch.com/educationamerica.html\n\nQUOTES ON LIBERTY & THE 2nd AMENDMENT\nhttp://wordofgod.0catch.com/declarationofindependence.html#quotes\n\n--------------------------\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This material is made available for the purpose of advancing understanding of environmental, political, human rights, economic, democracy, scientific, and social justice issues.\n\nThis constitutes a 'fair use' of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.

R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker) is the ruthless head of Travi-Com, a telecommunications firm on the cusp of a major breakthrough in laser communications technology. However, Travis needs diamonds to finish the project, so he sends a group of men to Zaire, where he's told that a large supply of the gems can be easily found. When the men go missing, Travis sends his trusted assistant Karen Ross (Laura Linney), a one-time CIA associate, into the jungle to find both his staff and the jewels. Hoping to keep her mission a secret, Karen travels to Zaire in the company of Peter (Dylan Walsh), a researcher on primate development who is hoping to return Amy, a gorilla who has been taught sign language and can \"speak\" English with the help of a glove-controlled computer device. Also travelling with them is Herkermer (Tim Curry), a Romanian with a secret agenda: he's convinced that Amy can guide him to the Lost City of Zinj, where he believes that King Solomon's Mines are located. Upon arrival, the group is met by Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson), a self-described \"great white hunter who happens to be black,\" and they discover that the jungle holds a menace that they weren't counting on: a tribe of bloodthirsty gray gorillas.

Those who work at the center are calling the outbreak \"an absolute living nightmare.\" it is a viral disease that affects animals in the families Canidae, Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Hyaenidae, Ailuridae, Procyonidae, Pinnipedia, some Viverridae and Felidae (though not domestic cats; feline distemper or panleukopenia is a different virus exclusive to cats). It is most commonly associated with domestic animals such as dogs and ferrets, although it can infect wild animals as well. It is a single-stranded RNA virus of the family paramyxovirus, and thus a close relative of measles and rinderpest. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs. Canine distemper virus tends to orient its infection towards the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract. The virus then enters the blood stream and infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital epithelial, and central nervous systems, and optic nerves. Therefore, the typical pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and hyperkeratosis of the nose and foot pads.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_a5LDfe0yA&list=PLDwMXS4c_4kX5DTj73uM-31NTUL7OsMq6\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This Video may contain copyrighted (\u00a9 ) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Check out Alex's other videos to learn more great finishing moves!\n\nHow to Perform the Dwyane Wade side step (euro step)!\n\n0:19 Recap of how to learn and master a new skill. Step 1 - Model, Step 2 - Visualise, Step 3 - practice with no ball, Step 4 - practice with ball but no basket, Step 5 - practice move on basket, Step 6 - Video Analysis, Step 7 - Try it in a game!\n\n1:04 Game footage of Dwyane Wade using the side step/euro step. \n\n1:37 We do a quick strength exercise that will help us to jump better from side to side while maintaining balance. \n\n1:48 Now we practice the footwork with a left and right finish but not using the ball yet. Left hand drive left hand finish. Right hand drive right hand finish. \n\n2:09 We will now do the same drill but incorporate the ball. Remember this is all about footwork and timing. Any time you use the side step/euro step you want to sell the lay-up in the direction you are driving. So if you drive right, sell the right hand lay-up and then step around the help defender at the last possible moment. \n\n2:36 Finally we score! We start by driving from the left wing both baseline and middle and then move over to the right wing to the same!\n\n3:00 Let's compare what we have practiced to Dwyane Wade himself! How does the move look in comparison to his side step? If you are happy that's great and you can start practicing it in a game!

Wilson, Michael Leeson\nFilm Description: Clothes make the superspy in this high-energy action comedy. Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret -- when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong. The Tuxedo marked the feature-film debut for director Kevin Donovan, who had previously won international acclaim for his work in television commercials.\n\n\"the tuxedo\",\"the tuxedo clip\",\"the tuxedo full movie\",\"the tuxedo part 1\",\"jackie chan\",\"peter stormare\",\"ritchie coster\",\"kevin donovan\",\"beaker videos\",\"coat videos\",\"action adventure\",comedy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",thriller,\"walter f parkes\",\"william s beasley\",\"adam schroeder\",\"laurie macdonald\",\"david coatsworth\",\"solon so\",\"john h williams\",\"willie chan\",\"brandi mcdougall neuwirth\",\"aggression videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++261092,/m/012d40,/m/03hlp6v,/m/012q4n", "title": "The Tuxedo (8/9) Movie CLIP - Tux vs. Tux (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T03:28:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oV3J-NYO5s", "description": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Barillier et Gilbert Bene, pr\u00e9sents au stand B\u00e2timent, parlent des m\u00e9tiers de l'industrie du d\u00e9colletage, qui communiquent peu sur leurs sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s !\n\n\nVid\u00e9o r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par les \u00e9tudiants en BTS Audiovisuel du lyc\u00e9e L\u00e9onard de Vinci (38).", "title": "D\u00e9monstration des m\u00e9tiers de l'industrie du d\u00e9colletage !", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T12:17:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6oVjm9HwJXI", "description": "http://www.outfityours.com/mophie-juice-pack-powerstation-xl/\nThe Mophie Powerstation XL is the longest lasting and best universal battery for smartphones and tablets.

The film will be a whole new take on the superhero foursome with an all new cast jumping into the roles of Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm.  The first go round hit theaters in 2005 and was a modest hit with $329 million worldwide.  The 2007 sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer failed to hit the mark with fans and managed a measly $278 million worldwide.  It's unclear if the franchise will continue the lighthearted tone of the first films or shift to a slightly more realistic tone as we saw in Trank's found footage hit Chronicle.  What is clear is the film is expected to be the next film Trank directs and the third superhero film to come from Fox in the next few years following next summer's The Wolverine and Matthew Vaughn's \u00acX-Men: First Class sequel which is set to hit theaters summer 2014.  We're guessing a possible November 2014 release for the new Fantastic Four, but no release date has been confirmed as of yet.\n\nAs for that other Fox superhero reboot, Daredevil, the studio has announced they are currently looking for a new director after the exit of David Slade.  Slade, best known for 30 Days of Night and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse has long been attached to the film, but had to drop out due to the studios desire to shoot in the fall and his commitment to directing the pilot for NBC's Hannibal, a take on the early life of Hannibal Lecter.  Fox is desperate to get Daredevil made this year, because if they don't get the blind superhero on the big screen soon, they risk having the rights to the character revert back to Marvel.  Probably something a lot of fans would like to see happen, but with comic book movie interest at an all-time high, the studio can't afford to lose such a well known character.\n\nSo which of these movies are you most excited to see and who would you cast in the roles?

I then unwrapped them into the pan straight out of the oven. The citric acid was added to half a liter of water and blended into the potatoes. The alpha enzyme was added at around 180 degrees. The stirring continued down to 150 degrees where I added the beta amylase. The stirring continued until the temperature was near 80 degrees. By this time the caked potatoes were thin enough to stir as if I had added a several liters of water, but I didn't. The yeast was added then.

Grevillea ist ein schnell wachsender, immergr\u00fcner Baum, der in seiner Heimat Australien durchaus 20 m H\u00f6he erreicht. Auch in Zimmerkultur w\u00e4chst der Grevillea innerhalb von wenigen Jahren auf eine Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von 2 bis 3 m heran. Der Grevillea hat zarte, bis etwa 40 cm lange, doppelt gefiederte, farnartige aussehende Bl\u00e4tter. Sie sind bei jungen Pflanzen br\u00e4unlich, im Alter gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbt.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Grevillea\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Grevillea kultiviert man mit m\u00f6glichst viel direkter Sonnenbestrahlung. Der Baum w\u00e4chst aber auch bei mittleren Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen noch ganz gut, im Winter sollte man aber auf jeden Fall f\u00fcr einen hellen Standort, m\u00f6glichst direkt vor einem Fenster, sorgen.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nSolange ein Grevillea gen\u00fcgend Licht bekommt und kr\u00e4ftig w\u00e4chst, gie\u00dft man m\u00e4\u00dfig. Vor dem n\u00e4chsten W\u00e4ssern l\u00e4sst man das Substrat leicht abtrocknen. In der \u00fcbrigen Zeit braucht die Grevillea weniger Wasser; man l\u00e4sst den Ballen der Pflanze zwischen dem W\u00e4ssern etwas st\u00e4rker abtrocknen als w\u00e4hrend der kr\u00e4ftigen Wachstumsphase.\nTemperatur\n\nIn der Wohnung vertr\u00e4gt die Grevillea gut unterschiedliche Temperaturen. Der Baum w\u00e4chst jedoch schneller in warmen R\u00e4umen mit hoher Luftfeuchtigkeit und erheblich langsamer bei k\u00fchlen Temperaturen. Steigen die Temperaturen \u00fcber 18 \u00b0C, stellt man die Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe in wassergef\u00fcllte Schalen auf Kieselsteine. W\u00e4hrend der winterlichen Ruheperiode sollten die Temperaturen nicht unter 7 \u00b0C fallen.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nWenn man Samen der Grevillea bekommt, kann man diese in einem beheizten Vermehrungskasten oder auf einer hellen, aber nicht vollsonnigen Fensterbank bei Temperaturen von 12 bis 16 \u00b0C zum Keimen bringen. Man verwendet f\u00fcr die Samenanzucht eine kalkfreie Aussaaterde die m\u00e4\u00dfig feucht gehalten wird. Wenn die S\u00e4mlinge der Grevillea etwa 5 cm hoch sind, pikiert man die Pflanzen einzeln in  kleine T\u00f6pfe und behandelt sie dann wie ausgewachsene Pflanzen weiter.\nErde / Substrat\n\nDie Grevillea kultiviert man in einer Komposterde mit etwas Torfzusatz. Da die Grevillea einen ph-neutralen oder leicht sauren Boden bevorzugen, sollte man darauf achten, dass das Substrat kalkfrei ist.\nUmtopfen\n\nIm zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr wird die Grevillea in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Topf umgetopft.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nIn der Zeit des schnellen Wachstums verabreicht man alle 14 Tage einen fl\u00fcssigen Volld\u00fcnger.

Obsessed with the trappings of death, Harold freaks out his blind dates, modifies his new sports car to look like a mini-hearse, and attends funerals, where he meets the spirited Maude (Ruth Gordon). An eccentric to the core, Maude lives exactly as she pleases, with avid collecting and nude modeling among her many pursuits. To the disgust of Harold's relatives and the befuddlement of Harold's shrink, Harold falls in love with her. As lilting Cat Stevens tunes play on the soundtrack, Maude teaches Harold a valuable lesson about making the most of his time on earth.\n\n\"harold and maude\",\"harold and maude clip\",\"harold and maude trailer\",\"harold and maude part 1\",\"harold and maude soundtrack\",\"harold and maude trouble\",\"tom skerritt\",\"bud cort\",\"ruth gordon\",\"hal ashby\",\"motorcycle videos\",\"tree videos\",\"truck videos\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"cult comedies\",\"dark humor black comedies\",\"charles mulvehill\",\"colin higgins\",\"road videos\",harold,maude,\"motorcycle officer\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++21605,/m/03jgbp,/m/035kl6,/m/06g4l", "title": "Harold and Maude (5/8) Movie CLIP -

Swansea City represent England when playing in European competitions, although they have represented Wales in the past. They play their home matches at the Liberty Stadium.\nThe club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and joined the Football League in 1921. The club changed their name in 1969, when it adopted the name Swansea City to reflect Swansea's new status as a city.\nIn 1981, the club were promoted to the original Football League First Division. It was during the following season they came close to winning the league title, but a decline then set near the season's end before finishing sixth, although a club record. It was from here the club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Football League Fourth Division a few seasons later, then narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference in 2003. Prior to playing home matches at the Liberty Stadium, the team had previously hosted at the Vetch Field. The Swansea City Supporters Society Ltd owns 20% of the club, with their involvement hailed by Supporters Direct as \"the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters' trust in the direct running of a club\".\nIn 2011, Swansea were promoted to the English Premier League, becoming the first Welsh team to play in the top division since its formation in 1992. On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 5--0 to win the 2012--13 Football League Cup (the competition's highest ever winning margin for the final), winning the first major English trophy in the club's history and qualifying for the 2013--14 UEFA Europa League.\n\nFirst Team Squad:\nMichel Vorm, Jordi Amat, Neil Taylor, Chico, Ashley Williams (Captain), Leon Britton, Jonjo Shelvey, Michu, Wilfried Bony, Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, Nathan Dyer, David Cornell, Roland Lamah (on loan from Osasuna), Wayne Routledge, Garry Monk (head coach), Leroy Lita, Dwight Tiendalli, Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n (on loan from Villarreal), Jos\u00e9 Ca\u00f1as, \u00c0ngel Rangel, Alejandro Pozuelo, Gerhard Tremmel, \u00c1lvaro V\u00e1zquez (on loan from Getafe), Kyle Bartley, Jazz Richards, Ben Davies, David N'Gog, Marvin Emnes (on loan from Middlesbrough)\n\nFor more information, as well as all the latest Swansea City AFC news, log onto the club's official website at http://www.swanseacity.net \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/SWANSPLAYER\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/SwanseaCityFC\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/swansofficial\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/swansofficial", "title": "Swans TV - Reaction: Ki on Man Utd win", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T16:15:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ouLu4Vncqs", "description": "Britain joins the European Common Market.

Asian elephants are threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation.\n\nIn general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. Their back is convex or level. Indian elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft), weigh between 2,000 and 5,000 kg (4,400 and 11,000 lb), and have 19 pairs of ribs. Their skin color is lighter than of maximus with smaller patches of depigmentation, but darker than of sumatranus. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Eight genera and 26 species are currently recognized\n\nPrey is killed by a process known as constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, a number of coils are hastily wrapped around it. Then, by applying and maintaining sufficient pressure to prevent it from inhaling, the prey eventually succumbs due to asphyxiation. The pressures produced during constriction have recently been suggested to cause cardiac arrest by interfering with blood flow,[4] but this hypothesis has not yet been confirmed.\nLarger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a house cat, but larger food items are known: some large Asian species have been known to take down adult deer, and the African rock python, Python sebae, has been known to eat antelope. Prey is swallowed whole, and may take anywhere from several days or even weeks to fully digest.\nContrary to popular belief, even the larger species, such as the reticulated python, P. reticulatus, do not crush their prey to death; in fact, prey is not even noticeably deformed before it is swallowed. The speed with which the coils are applied is impressive and the force they exert may be significant, but death is caused by suffocation, with the victim not being able to move its ribs to breathe while it is being constricted", "title": "Snake having SEX with a naked women", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T12:43:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6p3x7EL9Zkc", "description": "", "title": "\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627- \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T16:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6p3yq1JAZZg", "description": "First steps to create a Pivot Table to filter categorical data.

She is buying material for her recycled clothing line called Aywira. She looks for top-of-the-line neckties, scarves and handkerchiefs mostly sent to Bolivia from developed countries. Then her and her partner make them into new clothes, often selling them back to the countries they came from. \n\nShe says she's been collecting nice material for seven years but at the beginning she didn't know what to do with it.\n\n[Claudia Perez, Fashion Designer]: \n \"I wanted to really reuse it, to reuse the raw material. More than anything the great materials like silk, for example. I wanted to use it to make beautiful things.\"\n\nOnce she has scoured the used clothing stalls, Perez takes her finds back to the Aywira boutique and studio. There, she and her business partner, Marcia Devil make the scraps into new clothes.\n\n[Marcia Devil, Fashion Designer]:\n\"Something people might not realize is that we use really nice fabrics that come from specials brands, from fashion houses that specialize in fashionable ties like Hermes or [Salvatore] Ferragamo.

It is a long, hollow, coiled tube of cells. Sweat is produced in the coiled part of cells. The average person has 2.6 million sweat glands in their skin. There are two types of sweat glands. These are the eccrine and the apocrine. Sweat Miracle Reviews.\n\nThis type is the most abundant, that are found all over the body, mainly on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and forehead. Eccrine secretion is a watery clear, hypotonic solution composed of water, potassium lactate, sodium, organic compounds, ammonia, ornithine, urea, serine, citrulline, heavy metals, aspartic acid, and proteolytic enzymes. Sweat Miracle Reviews.\n\nThe primary function of the eccrine gland is thermoregulation. When your body temperature rises, your nervous system stimulates these sweat glands to secrete fluid onto the surface of your skin, cooling your body as it evaporates. Emotional stressors tend to stimulate sweating in the palms and soles. Sweat Miracle Reviews.\n\nThis type has limited distribution, found in armpits (axilla), near the anal area (perianal), genital area, nipple (areole), around the belly button (periumbilical), external ear canal and eyelids. They usually end in hair follicles rather than pores. Apocrine secretion is a thick, milky fluid and produced in smaller amounts than eccrine. It consist of ammonia, protein, lipids, and chromogranins. Although odorless at first, as it comes in contact with bacteria on the surface of the skin, an odor builds up. The exact function of apocrine glands is unclear, even though they are believed to represent scent glands. Secretions from these glands happen most often during periods of emotional anxiety or sexual excitement. Sweat Miracle Reviews.\n\nEccrine glands are smaller than apocrine glands and produce a sweat that is protein and fatty acids free. Unlike apocrine (become active only at puberty), eccrine glands are active from birth.

Psychotherapy looks at the whole person, it is a process of \n\nrelease, insight and change that can bring about healing and recovery \n\non a physical, emotional and mental level.\n\nAnalytical hypnotherapy is a method used to discover the sensitising \n\nevent of psychological problems.Looking at the cause and this is \n\nusually an emotional event in your childhood. When we find the root of \n\nthe problem, we can then remove the emotional attachment and view it as \n\nan adult problem and no longer as a child issue.\n\nThe critical factor is fully developed by age 11. Until then, the child \n\ninterprets each message literally, \"One of these days, you'll be the \n\ndeath of me.\". We live out that role, script or attribution throughout \n\nour lifetime as a self-fulfilling prophesy. When we experience a \n\ntrauma/event, the critical factor is temporarily blown aside and the \n\nnon-analytic mind forms a thought that then dominates a person's life, \n\nthis eventually turns into a phobia.\n\nA good example may be, as a child, you grow up playing in the garden, \n\ntouching worms, spiders and all sorts of imaginable living insects \n\nwhich live in a typical garden. When you grow up, thoughts start to \n\nfulfill your mind, infiltrating your brain with messages like \"Don't \n\ntouch that spider, it might bite you or jump at you\", similar thoughts \n\nmake make people scared of going near spiders.\n\nCertain issues respond particularly well to analytical hypnotherapy. I \n\ndeal with these and many other problems. Whatever your issue, you can \n\nbe sure that you will receive 100% of my effort as we work together to \n\nresolve your issue.\n\n\n\"hypnotherapy nhs\" \"Hypnotherapy Wakefield\" \"Hypnotherapy\" \n\n\"Wakefield\" \"how does hypnotherapy work\" \"self hypnosis\" \"hypnotherapy for weight loss\" \"Hypnosis\" \"hypnotherapy anxiety\" \"hypnotherapy courses\" \"history of hypnotherapy\" \"alan kershaw\" \"Hypnotherapy in Wakefield\" \"Holistic Hypnotherapists\" \"Wakefield Hypnotherapy\" \"hypnotist\" \"Still hungry after having gastric band fitted\" \n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/-2L9U9BIUws\nhttp://youtu.be/v46zMsBr9vU\nhttp://youtu.be/I5w0oDCcfYA\nhttp://youtu.be/tcmMKIJMm2o\nhttp://youtu.be/6UHtQRAF9hk", "title": "hypnotherapy nhs", "publishedDate": "2011-12-21T21:32:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pWvr1rcVvE", "description": "", "title": "Comment cr\u00e9er un cadran solaire", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T15:56:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pXLU0te3OM", "description": "", "title": "Post-it Durable Tabs", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T14:46:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pXk52L-EMo", "description": "Kia ora,here is the finished chef's weapon, wahaika on it's flax grass plaited thumb cord.The use of the thumb cord can be seen at the start of this video clip.

One is called relative geologic time, which involves deciding whether one dinosaur fossil is older or younger than another. The other is often called absolute geologic time, which involves estimating how many millions of years old a dinosaur fossil is.\nTo determine relative age, one must realize that dinosaur fossils are preserved in layers of sedimentary rock, such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and limestone, which are deposited in sequence, one on top of the other. Geologists record the sequence of these layers in a drawing called a stratigraphic section. Since lower layers in the sequence were deposited first, they are older than higher layers in the sequence. Thus, fossils contained in a lower rock layer are relatively older than fossils contained in a higher layer.\nThe sequences of rock layers containing dinosaur fossils often also contain layers of ancient volcanic ash, and the ash is composed of minerals crystals formed at the time of the eruption, which contain radioactive atoms, such as Uranium-238 and Potassium-40. These break apart at a constant rate in a process called radioactive decay. The atoms that break apart are called parent atoms, while those that result are called daughter atoms. Using sophisticated scientific instruments, geologists can measure how long it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay into daughter atoms, a time period called the half-life (4.5 billion years for U-238 and 1.3 billion years for K-40). Geologists then measure the proportion of parent and daughter atoms present in the ash crystals to determine the crystal's age.   For example, if half the parent K-40 atoms in a crystal have decayed to Argon-40 daughter atoms, the age of the ash is 1.3 billion years old, and fossils in rock layers near the ash layer are also assumed to be about 1.3 billion years old.", "title": "How do we know how long ago dinosaurs lived?", "publishedDate": "2012-12-03T17:32:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pYYl73ldkg", "description": "Este deliciosos licuado te ayudar\u00e1 a bajar la grasa abdominal\n\nIngredientes:\n2 rebanadas de pi\u00f1a\n2 ramitas de perejil\n2 varas de apio\n1 penca de nopal\n2 tazas de agua \n\nPara m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n entra en http://www.cadenatres.com.mx/nuestro-dia-0\n\nNo olvides dejarnos tus comentarios y visitarnos en\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/CadenaTresMx\nTwitter https://twitter.com/cadenatres_mx\nSitio http://cadenatres.com.mx\n\nlicuado circulacion, licuados para mejorar la cirulacion, licuados para la mala circulacion, alimentos para mejorar la circulacion de la sangre, nuestro dia, licuados saludables, tipos de licuados, circulacion, licuados 2013", "title": "Licuado para tener un vientre plano y mejorar la circulaci\u00f3n y digesti\u00f3n// DELICIOSO jugos verdes", "publishedDate": "2013-09-27T19:48:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pY_4uSm-rk", "description": "RC - HSP Backwash Buggy", "title": "RC - HSP Backwash Buggy", "publishedDate": "2012-07-14T17:43:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pZ_G9rs4qQ", "description": "Extrait du dvd \"Toi mon Berry\", Orchestre Dominique et St\u00e9phanie FLOQUET, danses, chansons et paysages.

Black & Decker have come up with a way to combine the power of a chain saw with the safety of a pair of clippers, the LP1000 Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw and has the ability to grip and saw in a single motion. \n\nThe Black & Decker LP1000 Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw can be used in a variety of situations including pruning, cutting firewood or cleaning up debris after a storm. It has large four-inch jaws that can safely cut through most wood. Because of the gripping action there is no possibility that the saw will hit the ground. The LP1000 Alligator Lopper has a six inch bar that makes it easy to cut wood and branches into small manageable size pieces. The saw comes with a two years manufacturers warranty.\n\nMost customers of the LP1000 chain saw are really impressed by how easy it is to use and its safety features. The blade is almost entirely enclosed; the only part that is exposed is that part that is going to do the cutting. You don't need to pick branches up off the ground, just grip them with the lopper and start cutting. It makes it incredibly easy to clean up. For an easy and safe way to chop up firewood or do the pruning around your house use the Black & Decker LP1000 Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw.\n\nhttp://chainsaws.rgmgroupmedia.com/black-decker-lp1000-alligator-lopper-electric-chain-saw", "title": "Black & Decker LP1000 Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T05:53:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6paQvSgSVOM", "description": "Jon I\u00f1arritu pide la salida de las FSE del territorio de Euskal Herria.", "title": "I\u00f1arritu: \"Time for peace, time to go home.

I am assuming that you have already run your server at least once in order to generate all of its folders.  I am also assuming that you already know how to install plugins.\n\nAnyway, once it is installed and you have run the server again, now it is time to actually make the groups.  To do this, open up the GroupManager folder under plugins.  Before you go any further just know that there are two ways to do this.\n\nIf you want the group to be used in multiple worlds you will need to edit globalgroups.yml.\n\nIf you only want to use the group in one world you will need to go into worlds then the folder with the name of your world and edit groups.yml.\n\nOk, once you have opened the groups.yml folder for your world, you should see something that looks like this:\n\nIf you are using Notepad++ then you will need to automatically convert tabs to spaces or else the file will not work properly if you edit it.  To do this go to \"Settings\" then \"Preferences\" click on \"Language Menu/Tab Settings\" and check \"Replace by space\".  Now, all you have to do is copy a premade group and edit a copy of it in order to make your own!  For example, if you wanted to allow players to give themselves nicknames then you would edit the default class to have the permission node \"- essentials.nick\".\n\nFull version of this text at http://tehostrichasylum.tk/\n\nThanks for watching!", "title": "Essentials Group Manager Usage", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T23:43:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6pemi2N7IUw", "description": "Vertebral compression fractures are the most common type of fracture affecting the spine.

It is not a disease in its own right and it is not a natural part of ageing. It is an umbrella term that describes a large group of symptoms that are caused by diseases that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease. \n\nDementia is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the brain. It is a progressive condition, meaning that it gradually gets worse. This is because when a nerve cell dies it cannot usually be replaced.  As more and more cells die the brain starts to shrink. This is known as brain atrophy, which can sometimes be seen in a brain scan of someone in the later stages of dementia.\n\nCommon symptoms of dementia include memory loss, impaired cognition and loss of physical coordination. However, the symptoms depend on the area of the brain that is affected. \n\nFor example, if nerve cells in the temporal lobe start to die, that person may start to have difficulties in their language, while nerve cell death in the occipital lobe, at the back of the brain, can cause problems with vision.\n\nSadly there is currently no cure for dementia and many of the diseases that cause it are terminal. The cerebellum and brain stem control our basic life functions. If cells die in these areas, the body will start to shut down.\"\n\n\n\nPlease watch our other videos to see how brain cells function, hear what dementia is, and to hear more about Alzheimer's disease, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia and other rarer causes of dementia. \n\nAlzheimer's Society is dedicated to defeating dementia through research. Our unique research programme funds research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of dementia to improve treatment for people today and to search for a cure for tomorrow.\n\nWe are the only organisation to work with leading scientists and people affected by dementia to ensure our research influences practice and transforms lives. With the right investment, dementia can be defeated. \nhttp://www.alzheimers.org.uk/research\n\nIf you have found this tool useful please consider donating to our research programme by following this link \nhttps://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/xforms_form.php?formID=164 \n___________\nWho are we?\n\nAlzheimer's Society is the leading support and research charity for people with dementia, their families and carers.\n \nWhat is dementia?\n\nThe term 'dementia' is used to describe the symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by specific diseases and conditions. Symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, confusion and problems with speech and understanding.\n\nSupport the fight against dementia and visit us at\nhttp://www.alzheimers.org.uk \n\nAlzheimer's Society\nLeading the fight against dementia\n____________________________\n\u00a9 Alzheimer's Society 2012.

It takes about 3 minutes to play.\n\nThe Tarantelle is a moto perpetuo marked Presto, and requires an advanced technique. It was inspired by Gioachino Rossini's song La Danza, also written in the tarantella's characteristic 6/8 rhythm. Chopin went to some lengths to ensure the time signature was the same as Rossini's, and he enlisted his friend Julian Fontana to check the best editions of the Rossini work for this detail. The manuscript shows Chopin changed his time signature from 12/8 to 6/8. There is no evidence the work was commissioned, nor was it dedicated to anyone.\n\nRobert Schumann described it as being in \"Chopin's most extravagant manner; we see before us the dancer, whirling as if possessed, until our senses reel. To be sure, nobody could call this music lovely, but we willingly forgive the master his wild fantasy. For is he not once in a while permitted to display the dark side of his soul?...\"\n\nChopin himself said \"I hope I won't write anything as dreadful too soon\". Despite this self-criticism, it has become a recording favourite, although it is less frequently performed in recital. (Wikipedia)\n\nPlease take note that the audio AND the sheet music ARE NOT mine.

They hang from the rice straw ropes \uff08shimenawa \u6ce8\u9023\u7e04\uff09 that mark a sacred site. They are attached to the sacred branches that people give as an offering in Shinto ceremonies (tamagushi \u7389\u4e32). They are used as a tool for purification, when swung to and frow in bulk at the end of a wand\u3000\uff08\u5927\u5e63/\u7953\u3044\u4e32). They stand next to mirrors at shrines as gohei.\n\nIn addition the the zig zag strips however, there are other pieces of paper that Shrines give out, specifically the pieces of paper that people take home to put in their household shrines (ofuda\u304a\u672d\uff09, and the pieces of paper that are contained inside Shinto lucky charms (omamori\u304a\u5b88\u308a). \n\nIt seems to me that essentially they are all the same, the vector for the sacred symbols of Shinto. When they are in their zig-zag form, the form which is usually given to shrines, they have yet to have been cut or torn into their individual form for distribution to worshippers as sacred tags (fuda\u672d) or lucky charms (omamori). \n\nThis video shows you how to make the zigzag strips and how I propose they were originally used, to create strips of paper for distribution to the faithful.\n\nI think that Shinto is a form of totemism, that is to say, a religion that structures distributes a certain type of sign. Levi-Strauss redefined totemism as \"savage thought\" or \"bricolage,\" (DIY), the use of things to hand, things in the world to signify their gods *and themselves*. The importance of this observation is that it provides a hint to a non logocentric (i.e. hearing yourself speak) form of self. \n\nThe problem with this interpretation is that, while Levi-Strauss concentrates on the use of natural articles for thought, he does mention the use of manufactured articles (such as gourds) used as totems, and even mythical articles (mythical creatures) used for totems. This considered, the distinction between \"savage thought\" and Western thought  using mental images of phonemes becomes very vague. If Shinto is a form of totemism then it has moved beyond using solely natural articles to using seals printed on pieces of paper. In what sense if any are such symbols part of the word and more than phonemes are part of the word? I suggest that these symbols, that are organised, distributed and valued by the Shinto religion are above all visual. \n\nThat visual signs can mean by themselves without the vector of the phoneme is argued persuasively by Hansen (1993) but runs directly against the Western tradition (Barthes, 1977) and is attacked vociferously by scholars such as Unger (1990). \n\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that these strips of paper evolved from the use of branches and leaves as is recorded in the ethnology of Kunio Yanagita, and is suggested by the form of the tamagushi, which I suggest are the old form of the Shinto symbol (a branch) combined with new (the zig zag strips shown in this video).\n\nBarthes, R.

It is one of the largest single-stone statues on Earth, and is commonly believed to have been built by ancient Egyptians in the 3rd millennium BC. It is the earliest known monumental sculpture.The Great Sphinx was believed to stand as a guardian of the Giza Plateau, where it faces the rising sun. It was the focus of solar worship in the Old Kingdom, centered in the adjoining temples built around the time of its probable construction. Its animal form, the lion, has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies appear as far back as the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. During the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the god Hor-em-akhet (Greek Harmachis) or Horus at the Horizon, which represented the Pharaoh in his role as the Shesep ankh of Atum (living image of Atum). A temple was built to the northeast of the Sphinx by King Amenhotep II, nearly a thousand years after its construction, dedicated to the cult of Horemakhet.", "title": "Great Sphinx of Giza", "publishedDate": "2007-10-29T08:39:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6q_9LXKOS4s", "description": "www.amtackle.com.au\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AMTackleSolutions\nBream fishing\nMulloway fishing\nSax Scent", "title": "Mulloway while chasing Bream in Melbourne", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T02:39:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6q_IqFSKZy4", "description": "", "title": "Grupo Fda- Depois da Briga.", "publishedDate": "2013-08-31T00:23:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6q_OOzp3XP4", "description": "Osso bucco, meatballs the size of softballs, and a traveling pasta station at a great affordable Italian restaurant.

These are some of the most precise and custom rifles you will ever see.   At first glance,  you may not even recognize them as firearms.\n   The unusual cartridge these use is called  \"6mm PPC\"\n (Palmisano & Pindel Cartridge),  which was developed in the 70's and was accepted by many benchrest shooters.\n--\nAbout Rail Guns: (per wikopedia)\nThe Unlimited class comes very close to living up to its name\u2014just about any single-shot rifle qualifies, up to and including \"rail guns\", which are rifle barrels and mechanisms built into a machine, or return-to-battery rest. With rifles such as these, some initially argued that no shooting skill was involved and was simply a test of the gunsmith's craft. However, shooting a RTB rifle requires a set of skills different than conventional marksmanship. What is removed with the return-to-battery (RTB) rifle is the need to physically aim the rifle for each shot, and evaluation of how any mirage will affect the shot. Judging the wind is as difficult and important with RTB rifles as with the other rifles. Given their mechanisms, it is arguably harder to compensate for ever-changing wind conditions when using a machine rest; the usual technique is to wait for what seems to be an identical condition rather than holding for the wind. Holding for the wind is quite common with the Light and Heavy Varmint rifles, and does offer certain advantages.\n \nBenchrest matches involve careful reading of wind conditions to compensate for bullet drift, and the rifles and ammunition must be of the highest possible quality. However, claims of the superior position of machining over marksmanship skills in RTB rifle shooting are bolstered by the fact that competitors build their own rifles, and nearly all handload their ammunition to tune it to the rifle.\n \nPrecision sights are also a requirement. High quality aperture iron sights could be used, but nearly all benchrest events allow telescopic sights. High magnification scopes are generally preferred; magnifications of 24x, 36x, or higher are common when allowed. Generally scopes will have turret adjustments to allow the scope to be easily adjusted for various shooting conditions.", "title": "The \"ROLLS ROYCE\" of Rifles - 6mm PPC \"RAIL GUNS\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-20T23:34:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6qbMLOezX4Y", "description": "NEW VIDEO - FULLY WORKING BYPASS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lg5u0ThQIo\n\nYes i repaired the phone :)\n\nwww.doulci.net", "title": "iPhone 4s iOS: 7.1.1 iCloud Activation Bypass Almost working", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T00:58:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6qbknwUCXXc", "description": "http://drphil.com\nBuy Life Code: http://bitly.com/LifeCodeDP\nSubscribe to Dr. Phil: http://bitly.com/SubscribeDrPhil\nLIKE us on Facebook: http://bitly.com/DrPhilFacebook\nFollow us on Twitter: http://bitly.com/DrPhilTwitter\n\nEarlier this year, 9-year-old former child pageant star Alana \u201cHoney Boo Boo\u201d Thompson saw her four-year reality television reign come to an end after reports surfaced that her mother, June \u201cMama June\u201d Shannon, was dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel -- who pleaded guilty to molesting Mama June\u2019s oldest daughter, 20-year-old Anna, when she was 8 years old.", "title": "Monday, November 17: The \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\" Scandal: Mama June Speaks Out - Show Promo", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T18:00:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6qc22kPUps0", "description": "This is kind of a funny video that illustrates the sliminess of an American eel.", "title": "Seein Eels on Lake Oconee", "publishedDate": "2010-12-19T01:45:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6qc8Vk85yk4", "description": "Baby View is available NOW on iOS, Mac and Android...\niPad Link\nhttp://appstore.com/babyview\niPhone Link\nhttp://appstore.com/babyviewpocket\nMac Link\nhttp://appstore.com/mac/babyview\nGoogle Link\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heybear.babyview\nAmazon Link\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hey-Bear-Productions-Baby-View/dp/B007S19QF4/ref=sr_1_5?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1354065302&sr=1-5\n\n...................................................................................................................................\nBaby View is a great way to stimulate eye co-ordination and focus in babies in the formative months of their lives.\n...................................................................................................................................\nHUGE update!\n\nBaby View's biggest update yet!

Add to that the extra dimensions of movement and sound, and your baby will be suitably impressed!\n\nBaby View contains a variety of simple and interactive scenes for you and your baby to enjoy together.\n\nThe scenes promote visual development, focus and motion tracking.\n\nEach scene falls into one of four main categories:\n\n\nBlack & white :\n\nThe highest possible contrast will engage even very young babies immediately! You will be delighted at how quickly they take to tracking the shapes across the screen. You will see your baby's eyes following the shapes around as their interest is peaked almost instantly!\n\n\nBlack, white & primaries :\n\nIntroducing simple colours along with the black and white patterns adds some vibrant colour to the mix!\n\n\nColours on black :\n\nBold, bright colours standing out against an all black background make these scenes great fun!\n\n\nFull colour :\n\nThese scenes are no holds barred - all colour, all the way!\n\n\nThe scenes have great interactive elements for you and your baby to play along with. Some may be tricky for baby at first, but I'm sure you'll be surprised at how swiftly they learn! \n\nYou and your newborn can get creative with images and music, introducing your little one to the sights and sounds of Baby View!\n\nAs well as being superb fun for healthy children, Baby View has been used specifically for helping babies whilst they are recovering from surgery after having their congenial cataracts treated.

In its self-proclaimed status as Caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its direct political control,[2] beginning with nearby territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Kuwait, Cyprus, and an area in southern Turkey that includes Hatay.[41][42]\n\nThe group, in its original form, was composed of and supported by a variety of Sunni insurgent groups, including its predecessor organizations, the Mujahideen Shura Council, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the insurgent groups Jaysh al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah and Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, and a number of Iraqi tribes that profess Sunni Islam.\n\nISIS witnessed significant growth as an organization owing to its participation in the Syrian Civil War and the strength of its supreme leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Economic and political discrimination against Iraqi Sunnis since the fall of Saddam Hussein also helped it to gain support. At the height of the Iraq War, its forerunners enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Ninawa, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city.[43][44][45][46] In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, ISIS has a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo.[47][48]\n\nISIS is known for its harsh interpretation of Islam[49] and brutal violence,[50] which is directed particularly against Shia Muslims and Christians.[51] It has at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks[52] who, in addition to attacks on government and military targets, have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.[53] ISIS had close links with al-Qaeda until 2014, but in February of that year, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its \"notorious intractability\" and wanton brutality.[54][55][55]\n\nISIS's original aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq.

At 171 feet (52 meters) it is the tallest lighthouse in the state of New Jersey and is the third-tallest masonry lighthouse in the United States. Construction began in 1854, with the light first lit on January 15, 1857. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1933 and although the light still shines every night, it is no longer an active navigational aid. The lighthouse is open to public visitation and for a small donation one may climb the 228 steps to the watch room and external gallery. A re-creation of the keepers' quarters was opened in 2002 and serves as a museum and gift shop. The original oil house now contains a Fresnel lens exhibit. It was designed by George Meade and still retains its original first-order fixed Fresnel lens. The lens is made of lead glass and weighs 12,800 pounds (5,800 kg) As the light was fixed (non-flashing), it does not have a landward segment allowing visitors to look up in the lens where the keepers entered it for maintenance. Jack E. Boucher conceived and oversaw the preservation of the lighthouse in 1964. The lighthouse is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places, the Historic American Buildings Survey, and the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.\n\nRebeca Nesselrode Reportera de Viajes, Unravel Travel TV visited Absecon Lighthouse and spoke to Jean Muchanic, Executive Director of the Absecon Lighthouse, Absecon Lighthouse\n\nAbsecon Lighthouse  http://www.abseconlighthouse.org\nAtlantic City, NJ  http://www.atlanticcitynj.com\n\nLIVE broadcast Unravel Travel TV http://www.unraveltraveltv.com\nUnravel Travel TV on You Tube http://www.youtube.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Twitter http://www.twitter.com/UnravelTravelTV\nUnravel Travel TV Pinterest http://www.pinterest.com/unraveltraveltv\nUnravel Travel TV Website http://www.unraveltravel.eu", "title": "Absecon Lighthouse, Atlantic City - Unravel Travel TV", "publishedDate": "2014-08-01T16:42:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rB77HJ7KUw", "description": "This was too easy ^^\n\nLike & Comment if you liked the video.\nDon't forget to click the SUBSCRIBE button to watch my future videos :)", "title": "Katarina smarting and outbaiting !

By the 1880s, wild ring-necked pheasants had become established in sustainable breeding populations within the\nUnited States and have remained one of the most popular and sought after upland game birds in central and northern regions of the country.  The ring-neck's\nexceptional quality as table fare, coupled with its high resistance to parasites and diseases common in ground-feeding birds, makes this colorful game bird both highly desirable and very manageable.  Also characteristic of the ring-neck is its ability to share similar niches with many native grassland and farmland community wildlife species.  One exception has been its interaction with native prairie chickens -- pheasant males can disrupt prairie chicken leks and hens may lay eggs in prairie chicken nests.  Consequently, efforts to repatriate prairie chickens in some areas may require prior removal of pheasants.\"", "title": "Ring-necked Pheasant, male, Kissena Corridor Park", "publishedDate": "2012-03-09T05:47:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rBJU7GQZLk", "description": "me and my mate sam in science:D\nD= we're smiling inside", "title": "phloem and xylem in science D=", "publishedDate": "2007-11-30T18:15:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rBbbdeg5pM", "description": "Drifting  slowly  floating  feeling", "title": "ROLAND d2 groovebox  Showy orange solid", "publishedDate": "2011-04-03T03:22:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rCDjn7whNE", "description": "Helping my son Francesco to get his second tooth out", "title": "Polling tooth out", "publishedDate": "2013-05-13T04:43:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rCJuWKo9KE", "description": "This demo shows how to create an email account in Outlook 2007.", "title": "How to create an email account in Outlook 2007", "publishedDate": "2009-04-07T12:01:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rCiPLUTckQ", "description": "Dissident Cinema Auteur Director Victor Balashov Statement along with Dissident Cinema Project Irene Caesar Photography Director manifesto on her conceptual art and the film making with stills dedicated to non-conformism ideas of the dissent with film protagonist A.S.

While removing the maggots from the man\u2019s ear, Dr. Yadav was kind enough to record too. \n\nAural myiasis is fairly common in tropical and subtropical regions according to Yahoo News Canada. It usually affects children under 10 or the elderly. The larvae feed off of the flesh in the patient\u2019s inner ear. In extreme cases, if left untreated, the maggots could eventually burrow into the brain and kill the patient.\n\nYadav suggests preventative measures if you notice a lot of house flies before you go to sleep. He recommends putting some cloth over your face so the flies can\u2019t enter any orifices and lay their eggs.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

This sticky resin, derived from the sap of Cistus incanus has been used for centuries as an ingredient in perfumes and incense, as well as to treat colds, coughs, menstrual problems, rheumatism, as well as for embalming and aphrodisiac purposes.\n\nAncient Greeks used a unique method for collecting the resin from these plants. Goats were allowed to graze among the Cistus incanus shrubs, and the resin would adhere to the hair of their coats, which was then shorn and boiled. The resin, which is not soluble in water, would eventually rise to the surface and would be skimmed off for later use. This complex and time-consuming process made labdanum a rare and highly prized commodity among ancient peoples. \nToday, modern techniques have made this process much more efficient. But still today in the Greek Isles, it is collected by threshing the plants by a kind of flail from which the sticky mass is scraped off with a knife and rolled into small black balls.\n\nHealth Benefits & Modern Medicinal uses\n\nThis plant is an aromatic, expectorant, stimulant herb that controls bleeding and has antibiotic effects. It is used internally in the treatment of catarrh and diarrhoea.\nRock Rose tea is three times as healthy as green tea and elderberry juice. It protects the heart four times better than red wine and it is an antioxidant twenty times stronger than freshly pressed lemon juice. Just a cup of tea a day is proven to stimulate the immune system significantly. \n\nThe human body requires this type of antioxidant to combat toxic substances. Scientists have found that the rock rose contains an adequate combination of these antioxidants, detoxifies the body and eliminates toxic heavy metals deriving from the smoke of cigarettes, dental fillings and environmental pollution. In addition, rock rose flower is a key ingredient in a homeopathic treatment, especially for stress.\n\nPresently, resin's main use is in perfume industry, as a fixative substance. It is often used in making cosmetic creams, because of its anti-wrinkle properties and shampoos, as it strengthens the hair follicle. It is also considered a sedative, astringent, heating, antispasmodic and expectorant. \n\nThe most outstanding effect of Rock Rose is its wound healing abilities. It used in any blend for healing skin issues, new or old scars, wounds, inflammation and infections. It is wonderful in blends for mature skin. It is a great anti-inflammatory and has a penetrating, deep aroma that opens up the senses.\n\nThe secret of these incredible versatile effects of the rockrose herb is the particularly high level of vitamin P, as well as certain tannic acid compounds or what we call polyphenols. Rockrose contains the highest level of these active agents of any substance known to man. These substances have a stronger antioxidant effect than the well-known vitamins E and C.", "title": "ROCK ROSE - CISTUS INCANUS CRETICUS", "publishedDate": "2013-06-23T17:24:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rE0v8tckrM", "description": "Florida State University students huddled together in the aisles of a packed campus library early Thursday after a gunman opened fire, injuring three.\nTwo of the shooting victims were taken to Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare.

This article is limited to the consideration of the Scripture teaching concerning the meaning of faithfulness in its application to God.\n\nFaithfulness is one of the characteristics of God's ethical nature. It denotes the firmness or constancy of God in His relations with men, especially with His people. It is, accordingly, one aspect of God's truth and of His unchangeableness. God is true not only because He is really God in contrast to all that is not God, and because He realizes the idea of Godhead, but also because He is constant or faithful in keeping His promises, and therefore is worthy of trust (see TRUTH). God, likewise, is unchangeable in His ethical nature. This unchangeableness the Scripture often connects with God's goodness and mercy, and also with His constancy in reference to His covenant promises, and this is what the Old Testament means by the Faithfulness of God (see UNCHANGEABLENESS).\n\n1. Faithfulfulness of God in the Old Testament:\n\nIn the Old Testament this attribute is ascribed to God in passages where the Hebrew words denoting faithfulness do not occur. It is implied in the covenant name Yahweh as unfolded in Exodus 3:13-15, which not only expresses God's self-existence and unchangeableness, but, as the context indicates, puts God's immutability in special relation to His gracious promises, thus denoting God's unchangeable faithfulness which is emphasized in the Old Testament to awaken trust in God (Deuteronomy 7:9; Psalms 36:5); Isaiah 11:5; Hosea 12:6,9). (For fuller remarks on the name Yahweh in Exodus 3:13-15, see article UNCHANGEABLENESS.) It is, moreover, God's faithfulness as well as His immutability which is implied in those passages where God is called a rock, as being the secure object of religious trust (Deuteronomy 32:4,15; Psalms 18:2); 42:9 (Hebrew 10); Isaiah 17:10, etc.). This same attribute is also implied where God reveals Himself to Moses and to Israel as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and their fathers' God (Exodus 3:6,15,16). The truth concerning God here taught is not simply that He stood in a gracious relation to the Patriarchs, but that He is faithful to His gracious promise to their fathers, and that what He was to them He will continue to be to Moses and to Israel. This is the fundamental, idea in the Old Testament concerning the faithfulness of God.(http://www.youtube.com/upload)http://www.thefreedictionary.com/faithfulhttp://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/faithful-faithfulness.html", "title": "BELIEVE IS THE BEST!!!!BE FAITHFUL ALWAYS!!!!\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0928\u0940\u092f \u0922\u0902\u0917 \u0938\u0947 \u0908\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u0947", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T10:25:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rs1cws9FuY", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/kleberatallaoficial?ref=tn_tnmn\nSITE - LOJA\nhttp://www.atallaescapes.com.br/\nRUA SOUZA LIMA 209-BARRA FUNDA-SP\nFAN PAGE - KLEBER ATALLA ESCAPES\nKLEBER ATALLA.\nCAIXA POSTAL 62572 CEP 01214-970", "title": "KLE621 FULL XJ 6 ABS TIFFANY SERRA DE MOGI BARULHO MONSTRO.", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T02:00:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rsIUkP6t7w", "description": "ei kritiikkii, vaan kehui kiitti", "title": "ihkuu laulan ihku pissis", "publishedDate": "2012-12-12T11:14:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rsb8gDXbBs", "description": "Satupdate : \n\n\u0e27\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 PSI OK   \u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e35\u0e19\u0e33\u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a PSI OK \u0e44\u0e1b\u0e15\u0e34\u0e14\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e08\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\n\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e44\u0e02\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32  LNB Freq 1\n\n\u0e08\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 = 11300\n\u0e08\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e33\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19 = 10750\n\u0e08\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d' \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19 \u0e46 = 10600 / 10750 / 11300", "title": "\u0e27\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 PSI OK", "publishedDate": "2012-01-07T03:31:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6rsf3xfJmvI", "description": "Lorella Springs Wilderness Park - Wurrilywuncha Creek Entrance to Gulf of Carpentaria in Australia's Northern Territory N.T..\n\nThis has only just become accessible by 4x4 track.

It covers the responsibilities of both parties during a tenancy and makes specific mention to the term 'tenant-like manner'.\n\nMoving home for the first time can be a daunting experience, but it's not as bad as it seems. Your landlord is responsible for lots of items and your safety is always paramount. They or your letting agency will make sure you have a gas safety certificate, an electrical safety certificate, fire safety equipment, working heating and hot water. They will also fix broken appliances.\n\nBut you, as tenants, can't expect your landlord to do everything. You're required to act in a 'tenant-like manner', where you do little jobs around the property, just as you would if you were the owner;\n\n- Change the light bulbs.\n- Unblock sinks, toilet and drains.\n- Leave the heating system on a timer or low setting to prevent pipes freezing in cold weather.\n- Empty vacuum cleaner bags and washing machine/tumbler dryer filters.\n- Keep the property well ventilated to stop the build up of condensation.\n- Check the fuse box for any tripped switches if lights or plug sockets stop working.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the different responsibilities, search online for 'The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985'.\n\nFor the latest updates, follow us on:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CPSHomes\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CPSHomes\nhttp://www.cpshomes.co.uk\n\nView our guide to renting accommodation in Cardiff: http://www.cpshomes.co.uk/lettings/tenants/guide_to_letting.aspx\n\nCPS Homes are experts in buying, selling, renting and property management in the Cardiff area, including Roath, Cathays, Cardiff Bay, City Centre and more.\n\nWe offer a varied array of properties from luxury apartments with water views to traditional townhouses in the heart of the city.

But if you get bored with those species, it's time to move on to the big game, and that is red-eyed tree frogs. \n\nRed-eyed tree frogs are beautiful terrarium subjects. I mean, they're one of our favorites as far as observing them in your terrarium, but they're more for the advanced keeper, in that they are extremely fragile. Just taking a look at some of the skinny little legs on these guys and the very narrow bodies can tell you right off the bat that they are not really the easiest things to keep. \n\nThey can leap tremendous distances, as you just saw, but it's really more the temperature, the humidity is something you really have to pay attention to when you keep these things in your terrarium. We have a different word these days for terrariums and that is a vivarium, and that's where I would keep my red-eyed tree frogs. A vivarium is different. A vivarium has the substrate or the bedding where the animal comes from. It has plants, hopefully live plants if you could afford it and find a good source for them, throughout the enclosure. \n\nBut in red-eyed tree frog world, which is a rainforest creature, you have to keep this thing wet, not just moist, I mean wet. Six months out of the year it's got to be soaking wet. So, we often put fog machines, waterfalls, misting systems like you see in the supermarket that mist the vegetables. Something like that that can keep the animal humid. \n\nWithout humidity, frogs will vanish quickly. So, the red-eyed tree frog is a wonderful vivarium subject, but something not for the beginner. A mistake, even a couple of days of wrong humidity, could be the end of the frog. So, you got to do your homework before buying one of these. And always we try to stress getting them from captive-bred sources. That gives you the most healthy animal out there.
