Totally uncool. Fortunately, CoolSculpting doesn't burn, shatter or extract any cells. Developed by Harvard scientists, our unique, FDA-cleared, patented procedure uses a targeted cooling process that kills the fat cells underneath the skin, literally freezing them to the point of elimination. Only fat cells are frozen. Your healthy skin cells remain, well, healthy. No knives. No suction hoses. No needles. No scars. Once crystallized, the fat cells die and are naturally eliminated from your body.  \n\nUnlike a lot of other procedures, CoolSculpting takes very little time and is pretty simple to fit into your daily life. After your CoolSculpting treatment you can typically get right back to your busy day. Each treatment lasts one hour -- the same time you might spend at the gym. So you can easily fit your appointment into a lunch break.\n\nAfter one visit, you'll typically see a noticeable reduction of fat. It takes a few months to fully realize the effects, mainly because it takes that long for your body to naturally dispose of the fat cells. And yes, you can lose even more with additional appointments if you and your doctor deem it necessary.\n\nSo after a few months, your clothes will fit better and you will look better. What's more, there are no pills or supplements. And as long as you maintain your normal diet and exercise, your long-term results should remain stable. That's Coolsculpting\nfor you.\n\nnon surgical liposuction\nnon surgical fat reduction\nfat reduction\nhow to lose belly fat for men\neasiest way to lose weight\neasy ways to lose weight\nhow to lose fat fast\n\nCoolsculpting | Non Surgical Fat Reduction with Coolsculpting http://www.instantlaserclinic.com.au/coolsculpting/  Call 1300 566 546", "title": "Coolsculpting | Non Surgical Fat Reduction with Coolsculpting | Melbourne, Australia", "publishedDate": "2012-10-16T07:31:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "995CMDoULF8", "description": "Photos from mid-May show how fast Cypripedium hybrids develop big clumps in the garden.", "title": "The development of a bed for hardy lady's slipper orchids 2010-2013", "publishedDate": "2014-05-17T14:08:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "995czLF3CMk", "description": "Meet Eric Chen, the Grand Prize Winner of the Google Science Fair 2013 and winner of the 17-18 Age Category.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the swine flu, Eric researched new methods of developing flu vaccines that can better respond to the fast-changing virus.

The nine CxxOMe (x = para-/meta-/ortho-) isomers represent the first phenyl-N-pyridinylcarbamate structures to be reported, with all nine forming N-H\u2022\u2022\u2022N hydrogen bonds as their primary interaction. Two isomers (CmmOMe, CmoOMe) form rare hydrogen bonded cyclic N-H\u2022\u2022\u2022N trimer synthons as R33(15), whereas, the three CoxOMe isomers form N-H\u2022\u2022\u2022N hydrogen bonded dimers based on R22(8). For all structures, C-H\u2022\u2022\u2022O interactions assist in aggregation and often including the methoxy group. The solid state and modeled conformations are mismatched in three systems where the methoxy groups and meta-methoxyphenyl rings (mOMe) of the solid state structures adopt meta-stable or unstable conformations compared to their optimized computational models.\n\nPavle Mocilac and John F.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster.

The book provides 21 living narratives, including: multinational companies bribery in Africa; Reserve Bank and the homelamd corruption; scandal of large orders of school text books; a corrupt professor turned politician; cyber corruption; Nkandlagate scandal; sharks and crocodiles in the industry; supply chain under fire; lonely wife monkey tricks; fronting; bribes come also in refuse bags these days!; shenanigans in state owned entities; military airbase; top brass politician under pressure to return a gift; why new brooms are failing to sweep clean? \u201cProfessor Modimowabarwa Kanyane has written a book that will add knowledge and understanding to the most ravenous social cancer of society \u2013 corruption. It is a disease which knows no social classes but largely prefers to afflict the greedy within society. The book assists in sharpening understanding and appreciation of the depth to which corruption has penetrated our society. Whilst the book is written by an academic, it is simple and accessible enough to be read and understood by any literate person.\u201d Review by Prof R.H Nengwekhulu \u201c21 Narratives of ethical dilemmas is a publication whose time has come. There could be no other time than now to shun corruption. Such corrupt activities as bribery, fraud, extortion, nepotism, favouritism, racketeering, money laundering and patronage are very dangerous and corrosive activities in society. In Africa, Latin-America and South-East Asia, where societies are hatching out of cocoons of colonialism, oppression and racism, corruption tends to reverse revolutionary gains. This book is the best work available on ethics, morality, accountability and integrity as a buffer zone to counter greed, gluttony, ostentatiousness and people\u2019s insatiable appetite for more money to get-rich-quick. Professor Modimowabarwa Kanyane has outdone himself this time with this outstanding and exceedingly informative piece of work.\u201d Review by Hon K.A.R Phala \u201cThis edition is a must-read for all champions of industry and their communities. It must be at the door of every public official, business, families, political and community leaders, including academics, learners and social agents. The 21st Century therapeutic resolutions for human pathologies presented in these 21 narratives are critical for human development within the context of modelled ethics architecture.

I wanted to look at learning and control so I choose to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as my controller/brain.The way it worked was that the robot has six sensors. These sensors fed into the input layer of the ANN. The information propogated through the network and would come out of the output nodes. The output nodes would then control the speed ad direction of the main servos controlling the arm. In order to find the right weights and topologies to get the ANN to read in the sensors and then actuate the servos to produce crawling behavior, I used an genetic algorithm to evolve an ANN. The genetic algorithm I used is called NEAT. I read about it from a paper called \"Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary Complexificaition\" by Kenneth Stanley. If you search in google the first link will take you to the paper. I plan on putting up at least one more video which shows how the ANNs are producing the crawling behavior. If anyone knows of a free and easy to use movie maker that allows me to play two movies side by side please let me know. But please comment or send me messages and tell me what you guys think.\n\nUpdate (6/5/10) Here's a link to the paper. If you guys like it and want to use something from it please ask and/or cite. I'm more than happy to talk to people about it and see the work continued.\n\nwww.engin.swarthmore.edu/e90/2008/reports/Roby%20Velez.pdf", "title": "Evolution of an Artificial Neural Network to control a crawling robot.", "publishedDate": "2009-06-19T13:46:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "99DQ8gnwwIs", "description": "", "title": "Endocrine Cat-AP2", "publishedDate": "2012-09-15T15:44:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "99DSvl4odzk", "description": "International Paints' Mike Hindmarsh and Alistair Finnie talk about the introduction of Intersmooth\u00ae7465Si SPC and Interswift\u00ae6900Si Silyl acrylate products, which complement International's market leading antifoulings range.", "title": "New coatings extend International Paint's antifouling range", "publishedDate": "2012-01-23T16:23:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "99DnKabLNjs", "description": "Whats up guys here's my second mintage hope you enjoy.", "title": "Snrkl - Mintage #1", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T17:00:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "99Ds-igEnM8", "description": "Kulai MP Teo Nie Ching says she is disappointed to find changes made to her written question to the Home Minister in Parliament without her knowledge.", "title": "Parliament: MP's question altered, Junaidi deems it reasonable", "publishedDate": "2013-07-10T08:09:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "99E0NsL50oo", "description": "For inquiries\nMS.

I primi coloni europei lo conoscevano come \"tigre della Tasmania\" o \"lupo della Tasmania\".\n\nIn apparenza, il lupo marsupiale della Tasmania somigliava ad un grosso cane dal pelo corto con una coda sottile che si estendeva dal corpo come quella dei canguri e con numerose strisce nere verticali sul dorso ed era contraddistinto da un'apertura delle mandibole sorprendentemente ampia. La tasca marsupiale del tilacino si apriva verso la parte posteriore del corpo. La forma della spina dorsale cambiava bruscamente pi\u00f9 o meno a met\u00e0 del corpo.\n\nIl tilacino sopravvisse fin a circa il 1930. La sua completa estinzione fu causata dalla spietata caccia messa in atto dagli allevatori, dalle taglie messe dal governo locale e, negli ultimi anni, dall'avidit\u00e0 dei giardini zoologici d'oltremare. L'ultimo avvistamento ufficiale di un tilacino in libert\u00e0 risale al 1932, mentre Benjamin, l'ultimo tilacino, mor\u00ec in cattivit\u00e0 nello zoo di Hobart il 6 settembre del 1936. Prima della sua morte fu realizzato un breve filmato in bianco e nero che lo ritrae mentre si aggirava per la sua gabbia. Sebbene ormai sia dato per certo che il lupo marsupiale sia estinto, si ha spesso notizia di presunti avvistamenti (mai accertati) in Tasmania e in Australia.\n\n(fonte Wikipedia)\n\nhttp//:mondomistero.blogspot.com", "title": "La tigre della Tasmania", "publishedDate": "2008-03-10T19:09:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "99Ktw97l6RQ", "description": "What is an American corporate plane doing in Iran, of all sanctioned places?

She toured from San Francisco, California to New York City and became a star both on vaudeville and Broadway. She was an accomplished singer, comedian and actor.\n\nIn 1908, she married singer/songwriter Jack Norworth. The two toured together and were credited for collaborating on a number of tunes, including their huge hit Shine On, Harvest Moon, which the pair debuted in Florenz Ziegfeld's Follies of 1908.\n\nBayes made many phonograph records, some with Norworth, for the Victor Talking Machine Company and Columbia Records. From 1924 through 1928, her accompanist was pianist Louis Alter, who later was the songwriter of such tunes as \"Manhattan Serenade,\" \"Nina Never Knew\" and \"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?\"\n\nIn 1928, Nora Bayes contracted cancer and died during surgery. She was buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.\n\n\nNora Bayes - The Broadway Blues (1920)", "title": "Nora Bayes - The Broadway Blues (1920)", "publishedDate": "2009-05-23T03:19:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "99Mi41JTdCg", "description": "How To Cure Hypothyroidism \nhttp://www.HypothyroidRevolution.org\n\nIn alternative medicine, there is very little difference in curing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. This is because the treatment involves assisting the thyroid to heal, in either case. Those with hyperthyroidism should not use iodine, because it could overdrive the thyroid, worsening the condition.\n\nCuring thyroid disease requires a long-term commitment for a period of at least a year. Creating this problem took years of self-poisoning, so fixing it is neither quick, nor easy. Hypothyroidism medications are addictive, and the body becomes reliant on them, which is why the mainstream establishment maintains that people must take them forever. Those who have been taking hypothyroidism medications for years must slowly wean themselves from the drugs. Abruptly stopping these medications will result in extreme fatigue, and additional thyroid problems.\n\nTreatment Recommendations\n\nEliminate and discard all non-stick cookware\nEliminate Soy - Soy suppresses thyroid function, imbalances hormones, and it has been shown to cause goiters (an enlargement of the thyroid gland) in previously healthy individuals, which shows that it disrupts iodine usage.\nAdhere to an Alkaline Diet - This is extremely helpful when curing any chronic disease. Reference the Body pH and Disease article to guide you.\nBalance Estrogen Levels (Women) - Excess estrogen slows down the thyroid gland. This means eliminating birth control medications, increasing the fiber in the diet, and avoiding all non-organic meats. Growth hormones in meats lead to imbalanced hormones. Reduce dairy intake, because milk often contains lots of estrogen; primarily because cows are milked frequently during pregnancy.\nExercise - Find a physical activity that is fun, and do it often. We believe that exercise could half the cure time in some cases, and curing is not possible without it.\nHemp Fiber - This is a broad spectrum supplement and a mild laxative.\nL-Tyrosine - Tyrosine is a natural amino acid which helps the body produce its own thyroid hormone. This is also known to help with the depression, which usually accompanies hypothyroidism. Most naturopaths recommend that 500 mg. be taken 2-3 times daily.\nL-Arginine - Arginine is known to stimulate the thyroid and its hormones. It also improves immune function, improves fertility, and alleviates erectile dysfunction.\nIodine - The thyroid needs iodine to function properly, and lots of people now suffer from iodine deficiencies. To test yourself, place some iodine (we use 2%) on your stomach. Make a dot the size of a silver dollar (or twice the size of a British 50p). If it disappears within 12 hours, then you are iodine deficient. Keep adding iodine in increasing amounts, until it no longer disappears in a 12-hour period. This works due to the fact that the body absorbs iodine at the rate at which it is needed. Do not use povidone iodine and do not orally consume iodine. This is especially an important precaution for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nAvoid all sources of fluoride - As already mentioned, fluoride suppresses the thyroid, and is likely to be the leading cause of hypothyroidism. Drink spring water, avoid soft drinks, use fluoride-free toothpaste, use a shower filter, and throw away non-stick cookware. Both coffee and tea naturally contain fluoride, so use iodine to compensate if these drinks are indispensable.\nEat a natural diet - To help the body to heal itself, remove burdens on its immune system. This means that all processed foods, artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, white flour, white sugar, table salt, hydrogenated oils, aluminum, high fructose corn syrup, and etcetera should be eliminated from the diet. Organic food is the ideal. Do not trust marketing that reads \"All Natural\", because this phrase is unregulated, so anyone can use it for anything. Read labels carefully.\nChlorophyll - Supplementing with chlorophyll provides essential copper, helps oxygenate the body, builds healthy red blood cells, and it overall assists with skin health. Chlorophyll is a safe method of orally supplementing with copper. Those who are using our Colloidal Copper Lotion are unlikely to need more copper.\nZinc and Selenium: Studies indicate that severe zinc or selenium deficiencies can cause decreased thyroid hormone levels. Never take zinc on an empty stomach. Brazil nuts are high in both zinc and selenium.\nCoconut Oil: Buy organic, cold-pressed, coconut oil from a health food store. Take around 1 teaspoon of it daily. You can also use it to cook with, but be warned that it smokes at low cooking temperatures, so it should only be used for low-heat cooking. Coconut oil speeds the metabolism, encourages production of the thyroid hormone, and kills candida yeast.", "title": "Hypothyroidism and Panic Attacks", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T12:16:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "99NW5pKVsU8", "description": "", "title": "\u10de\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8\u10d9\u10d0", "publishedDate": "2013-12-25T07:06:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "99ONsVK2F9E", "description": "", "title": "Hand game's with Moose", "publishedDate": "2013-12-07T21:02:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "99Ol_Q_JjQU", "description": "Poczuj atmosfer\u0119 \u015awi\u0105t z Coca-Cola na:\nwww.facebook.com/cocacola\nwww.instagram.com/cocacolapolska\nwww.twitter.com/cocacolapolska \n#corazblizejswieta\n#podarujradosc", "title": "#PodarujRadosc w \u015awi\u0119ta!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T15:24:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "99Olj7OeKSQ", "description": "Dj Simone  De Caro plays Steve Nocerino - lotus Autistic remix @ UND Republic Contamination Mulino Della Frega Lardirago (PV) 6-9-2008", "title": "Dj Simone  De Caro plays lotus Autistic remix", "publishedDate": "2008-09-08T07:19:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "99P4oy_0xxE", "description": "PollyMangoTV's shared video file.", "title": "Polly mango Soft Launce Mango TV", "publishedDate": "2010-02-18T09:28:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "99PBdE4eK9w", "description": "Rose Clancy of The Clancy Tradition performing at The Towne Crier Cafe, Pawling, NY.

Peter Shumlin has nearly been unseated in a shocking upset. In a process unique to Vermont, projections now show the governor's race will be decided by the state Legislature after neither Shumlin nor his Republican challenger reached the necessary threshold of 50 percent. The state Legislature remains solidly Democratic, so Shumlin will likely keep his seat. But Shumlin was not considered a vulnerable candidate before last night, and Scott Milne, his challenger, was a relative unknown. The election is seen as a possible referendum on healthcare reform after Shumlin has vowed to make Vermont the first state with a single-payer healthcare system. The state's embattled health insurance exchange implemented under Obamacare has been down since September. We are joined by Peter Sterling, executive director of Vermont Leads, an organization that advocates for single-payer healthcare in Vermont. \n\nWatch full 2014 election coverage on Democracy Now! in our archive: http://www.democracynow.org/topics/2014_election\n\nDemocracy Now!, is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on 1,200+ TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

She was snapped up by Deram where she was teamed up with in-house whiz-kid producer Wayne Bickerton, arranger supreme John Cameron and the cream of London session players. \n\nRun the Length of Your Wildness can't quite make up its mind whether to be pop-folk or Swinging London pop/rock. In that respect, as well as in its Baroque orchestral arrangements it's reminiscent of another late-'60s record, Dana Gillespie's Foolish Seasons \u2014 not surprising, as Bickerton produced both albums. The resemblance between the two singers is emphasized by a song that appears on both LPs, 'Tears in My Eyes'. You can throw in some similarities to a few other British female vocalists of the time straddling the lines between pop and folk, like Marianne Faithfull, Vashti Vunyan and (much more distantly) Judith Durham of the Seekers or even Sandie Shaw. \n\nGreen did write or co-write much of the material on the album, and some of it's above average for this orchestrated British pop-folk-rock genre, particularly 'Primrose Hill' and the slightly Donovan-ish 'Promise of Something New'.", "title": "Kathe Green - Primrose Hill", "publishedDate": "2012-03-22T12:14:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "99_mKD9PQVA", "description": "How to make money online - http://adf.ly/d0GCf\n\nFULL POST : http://realpcgeeks.com/how-to-get-blackmart-alpha-on-android-without-root/\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK : http://www.facebook.com/Realpcgeeks\nMusic by Dan-O at DanoSongs.com \n\nTHIS VIDEO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!!

Sul posto, alle 11 sono giunte dunque ben 160 persone, tra piloti, staff e accompagnatori: il primo decollo si \u00e8 svolto alle 12, ma l'inizio di una leggera pioggia ha convinto la direzione della gara ad interrompere la prima track della competizione per questioni di sicurezza. \n\nMolti piloti hanno comunque scelto di effettuare lo stesso il loro volo, con atterraggio nella pista  localizzata nella localit\u00e0 di Godo, avendo cos\u00ec l'opportunit\u00e0 di provare il cielo friulano in attesa della seconda track, in programma per domani, 4 giugno.

It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\nThe genus Neophron contains only a single species. A few prehistoric species from the Neogene period in North America placed in the genus Neophrontops (the name meaning \"looks like Neophron\") are believed to have been very similar to these vultures in lifestyle, but the genetic relationships are unclear. The genus Neophron is considered to represent the oldest branch within the evolutionary tree of vultures. Along with its nearest evolutionary relative, the lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus), they are sometimes placed in a separate subfamily, the Gypaetinae. There are three widely-recognised subspecies of the Egyptian vulture, although there is considerable gradation due to movement and intermixing of the populations.\n\nThe nominate subspecies, N. p. percnopterus, has the largest range, occurring in southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the north-west of India. Populations breeding in the temperate zone migrate south during winter. It has a dark grey bill. The Indian subcontinent is the range of subspecies N. p. ginginianus, the smallest of the three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790). A small population that is found only in the eastern Canary Islands was found to be genetically distinct and identified as a new subspecies, N. p. majorensis in 2002. Known locally as the guirre they are genetically more distant from N. p. percnopterus, significantly greater even than N. p. ginginianus is from N. p. percnopterus. Unlike neighbouring populations in Africa and southern Europe, it is non-migratory and consistently larger in size. The subspecies name majorensis is derived from \"Majorata\", the ancient name for the island of Fuerteventura. The island was named by Spanish conquerors in the 15th century after the \"Majos\", the main native Guanche tribe there. One study in 2010 suggested that the species established on the island about 2,500 years ago when the island was first colonized by humans.\n\nNikolai Zarudny and H\u00e4rms described a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was described as having a deeper reddish orange skin on the head and a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.\n\nThe genus name is derived from Greek mythology. Timandra was the mother of Neophron. Aegypius was a friend of Neophron and about the same age. It upset Neophron to know that his mother Timandra was having a love affair with Aegypius. Seeking revenge, Neophron made advances towards Aegypius' mother, Bulis. Neophron succeeded and enticed Bulis into entering the dark chamber where his mother and Aegypius were to meet soon. Neophron then distracted his mother, tricking Aegypius into entering the chamber and sleeping with his own mother Bulis. When Bulis discovered the deception she gouged out the eyes of her son Aegypius before killing herself. Aegypius prayed for revenge and Zeus on hearing the prayer changed Aegypius and Neophron into vultures.", "title": "Egyptian Vulture - Scavenger Vulture - Pharaoh's Chicken", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T04:05:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "99jwDW19CEM", "description": "John Barrowman recounts scaring Eve Myles on set by hiding in her shower for 45 minutes", "title": "John Barrowman hides in a shower for 45 minutes to play a prank - Torchwood Panel Comic-Con 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-07-23T07:45:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "99k7x4IuUVI", "description": "Buy this book:\nhttp://www.bookdepository.com/Elements-Eloquence-Mark-Forsyth/9781848316218?a_aid=candysomething\n\n'The Horologicon' Review\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpTE1hQUGbA\n\nRead My Short Story\nhttp://candysomething.bigcartel.com\n\nhttp://twitter.com\nhttp://candysomething.com", "title": "'The Elements of Eloquence' by Mark Forsyth | Review", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T21:08:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "99kHV2cv81I", "description": "", "title": "Homogenizer", "publishedDate": "2010-04-09T10:27:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "99kHp1kWoFQ", "description": "Kato Noriko noriko  kato  \u52a0\u85e4\u7d00\u5b50  sakurakko", "title": "Sakurakko Club Sakura Gumi - Do-Shite", "publishedDate": "2006-07-22T02:51:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "99kNaHFzWDc", "description": "Did it work?

Watch and learn about the various mortgage products available so you can make an informed decision. \n\nAs a homebuyer, you have a choice of different mortgage products to finance your purchase:\n\nFixed-rate loan: Provides a constant interest rate and monthly principal and interest payment for the life of the loan. Some advantages of fixed-rate loans: \n\u2022 Easier to budget.\n\u2022 Offers protection against rising rates.\n\nAdjustable rate loan: The interest rate and monthly payment can fluctuate. Some advantages of adjustable rate loans: \n\u2022 Typically, interest rates are initially offered at a discount rate. \n\u2022 In a low-rate environment, an ARM can save significant money over a fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nFHA loan: Mortgage loan that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Some advantages of the FHA loan:\n\u2022 Lower down payment, typically 3.5%.\n\u2022 Lower closing costs.\n\u2022 Easier credit qualifying.\n\nVA loan: Mortgage loan guaranteed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and is intended for veterans or active military members. An advantage of a VA loan:\n\u2022 Typically no down payment.\n\nJumbo loan: A mortgage with a loan amount that is above the limits set by the government, also referred to as a non-conforming loan. This type of mortgage allows you to make a purchase on a home that exceeds the amount of money you would be able to acquire with a conforming fixed or adjustable rate loan. An  advantage of a jumbo loan:\n\u2022 If you are able to afford monthly payments, you can finance a larger loan without making a large down payment.\n\nThere is a range of mortgage products, so it is important to research what is best for your needs. Buddie, a mortgage banker, explains what to expect when it's time to look for a mortgage: \"Be prepared with a lot of different terms and acronyms when dealing with a mortgage banker and if there's ever any time that you don't understand, just ask.\" \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe hope you've found this video and the many others on the My New Home YouTube channel helpful. Here are some other resources you might be interested in.\n\nThere is a lot to know before choosing a mortgage. To get started, check out:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-BUNymxmY\n\nBeyond mortgage products, there is also the loan term to consider. To learn about two of the most common and the differences between them:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDXG3VD_Cg\n\nFor more real advice from real people on finding and buying a home:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/mynewhome\n\nVideos are for informational purposes only and represent the opinions of the speakers. Chase does not warrant the completeness, timeliness or accuracy of the content.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT:\n\nJA YUNG:  When you're dealing with trying to choose a mortgage that's right for you, there are many options out there.\n\nJA YUNG: The most common products that you would probably come across would be a fixed interest rate where the interest rate never changes and it's a set number of years that you're going to pay on the loan and when you're done paying that period of time, that loan is paid off and you don't owe anything more. \n\nJA YUNG:  Then you also have your adjustable rate mortgages where the interest rate may be fixed for a set period of time, let's say one, three, five, or seven years, and then every year after that, the interest rate changes, so therefore your payment would be changing as well. \n\nBUDDIE: So an FHA loan is a government sponsored loan that you can get in with a little bit lower of a down payment, typically that's 3.5%. \n\nJA YUNG:  It's a nice product for a first-time home buyer, but it's really great for any home buyer who may have a little bit higher debt-to-income ratio or they may not have as much cash in the bank to be able to utilize for reserves, or somebody who doesn't have the most perfect credit.\n\nCURT:  VA loans are for military folks, either current military or retired military and the benefits to a VA loan primarily are no down payment.\n\nJA YUNG:  When you're dealing with a VA loan, one of the most important things is that we do have to verify your participation in the military.\n\nJA YUNG: Jumbo loan is typically a loan that's larger than what we would consider to be a conforming loan size. These are loan sizes that are established by the government based on what the median income and median house prices are. So jumbos are typically your larger loan sizes. It typically means that they're higher interest rates and a little bit more strict credit guidelines.\n\nTOM: Depending on the county you live in, across the country each county has a different limit. But normally speaking a jumbo loan is anything over $417,000.", "title": "Types of mortgages: Understand different types of mortgage home loans", "publishedDate": "2013-06-03T18:37:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "99l4DOEQV8c", "description": "Doros\u0142y, pierz\u0105cy si\u0119 do spoczynku p\u0142atkon\u00f3g p\u0142askodzioby ze staw\u00f3w G\u0142owaczewo pod Ko\u0142obrzegiem, 16.07.2014.

Director Lewis Milestone pioneered the use of the sweeping crane shot to capture a ghastly battlefield panorama of death and mud, and the cast, led by Lew Ayres, is terrific. It's hard to pick a favorite scene, but the finale, as Ayres stretches from his trench to catch a butterfly, is one of the most devastating sequences of the decade. The film won Oscars for Best Picture and for Milestone's direction -- and trivia buffs should note that the actors were coached by future luminary George Cukor, while Ayres became a conscientious objector in World War II.

The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 behind Barbra Streisand's collaborations album Partners.\n\nBut there's one song in particular that has Team Breezy buzzing. Speculations has swirled that \"Drunk Texting,\" featuring the line \"If by chance you're laying next to someone else right now/I hope it's the worst sex ever,\" is about Rih.\n\n\"Oh no, not at all,\" Brown said. \"I think that's just the fans' perception or the media's perception at all times because of our history. But whenever we do music, people can make the assumption and that's fine because if they buy more because they think that, then go ahead and buy a thousand copies!\n\n\"But as far as me writing and going into that, I don't really try to put my focus on Rihanna every song,\" Brown continued. \"At the end of the day it's almost six, seven years later. It's like, how many more times am I going to talk about the same situation?\"\n\nNEWS: Chris Brown's 7 Most NSFW 'X' Lyrics\n\nIn the wake of Ray Rice's NFL suspension, domestic violence has been at the forefront of national attention. Asked for his own advice for the athlete, Brown previously told MTV News that \"it's all about how you push forward.\"\n\nNow, Brown is telling Frazier exactly how he has pushed forward since facing his own demons.\n\n\"You have to forgive yourself,\" he said. \"You can't beat yourself up over the years, because it'll just eat at you and you'll be stuck in the past. And for me, I just learned to be a more humble individual and more of a conscious person.\"\n\nWATCH: Chris Brown and Ariana Grande Are Lovers in 'Don't Be Gone Too Long' Video\n\nSo what's next for the singer? With his jail sentence behind him, Brown tells ET that he currently does remodeling and building maintenance as part of his community service. But he's also got an eye towards the future.\n\n\"In five years I want to be at the top, higher than the clouds,\" he mused. Asked how he'll get there, Brown replied: \"Following my own path musically and whatever I want to do. I can't be a carbon copy of someone else. I can only be the best Chris Brown. He hasn't let me down musically yet, so I'm going to try to do him.\"\n\nFrazier's interview with Brown airs on Thursday's episode of Entertainment Tonight.", "title": "Chris Brown Talks Rihanna Friendship  'We're Just Having Fun'", "publishedDate": "2014-09-26T02:49:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "99pFewhysvM", "description": "For more info: https://bailiwickchicago.com\n\nBlair Robertson gives insight into the process of creating MAHAL and her character.

Once a failing and unsafe school that was plagued by high staff attrition, low student attendance, low parent engagement, and one of the highest student suspension rates in the district, Gompers Preparatory Academy (GPA) has shown steady improvement since converting to a public charter school in 2005. Teacher retention rates have more than tripled, suspension rates have been reduced by 75%, attendance has improved from 91% to almost 96%, and parent engagement has exploded with over 3,000 hours logged per year.   Building on years of school culture transformation and steady gains on state test scores, GPA's Academic Performance Index (API) scores climbed by 88 points in 2011.  A Cinderella story indeed, GPA has turned a failing campus into a thriving school that serves its community in Southeastern San Diego.\n \n\nMission Statement:\nThe mission of Gompers Preparatory Academy, in partnership with University of California, San Diego & our community, is to accelerate academic achievement for ALL students through a college preparatory culture & curriculum.\n\nWebsite/Further Information:\nwww.gompersprep.org", "title": "Gompers Preparatory Academy - Tara James and Vairon Perez Sing Greatest Love of All", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T11:45:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9A2gnkSPOOM", "description": "By D.

These plant extracts are being used for decades by millions of people for effective and immediate results. With meticulous selection of various such herbs and incorporating precision manufacturing techniques, Sandhi Sudha Joint Pain Relief Oil helps in reducing the severity of pain in knees, back, shoulder, elbow, neck, wrist, and ankles in 10-15 days of application. The use of Sandhi Sudha Plus helps the joint regain its stability and strength while effectively reducing the pain emanating from a dry nonfunctioning joint.\n\nHow does Sandhi Sudha Plus joint pain relief oil work?\n\nLess or reduced synovial fluid in the space between the joints cause less to no lubrication and lead to bones rubbing against each other causing continuous pain. Sandhi Sudha Plus on application penetrates the layers of skin through the outer tissues and reaches the joint space restoring the lubrication and warmth between the joint. The swollen inflammatory tissues around the joint get immediate relief from the application of Sandhi Sudha reducing the pain coming from these tissues. Increased blood flow in the veins around the joint stimulate the synovial membranes for better fluid production thus providing effective lubrication between joints. It also regenerates the damaged tissue and treats the injured parts of that area.\n\nHow to use?\n\nSandhi Sudha Plus is for external application only. Take one or two teaspoons (approximately 5 ml) of the oil in a bowl or in your palm. Dip your fingertips in the oil and start massaging the affected area gently with fingertips. Make sure that the pressure is not too much while applying and the area of application is clean and without any cuts or wounds. Keep the motion circular in direction and keep massaging for 3-5 minutes.\n\nThe application should be repeated 3-4 times in a day for 15 days and further as and when need be.\n\nFor the maximum benefit, give hot fomentation after massaging the affected area.\nDelivery in All Major Cities And Town in India!\n\nHyderabad, Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Chennai, Ujjain, Jammu and Kashmir, Bangalore, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Haryana, Lucknow, Rajasthan, Ghaziabad, Alwar, Dhanbad, Visakhapatnam, Dehradun, Patna, Guwahati, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bihar, Muzaffarnagar, Tamil Nadu, Bareilly, Kerala, Mathura, Durgapur, Jodhpur, Punjab, Tirupati, Amritsar, Mysore, Srinagar, Karnataka, Kolhapur, Noida, Rampur, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Pune, Kurnool, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Jammu, Aurangabad, Vadodara, Kochi (Cochin), Bikaner, Navi Mumbai, Bilaspur, Jamshedpur, Rajasthan, Orissa, Nashik, Moradabad, Gorakhpur, Agra, Allahabad, Madhya Pradesh, Amravati, Uttar Pradesh, Bhilai, Varanasi, Patiala, Ajmer, Gwalior, Sonipat, Jaipur, Firozabad, West Bengal, Surat, Rajkot, Meerut, Panipat, Tamil Nadu, Raichur, Andhra Pradesh, Raipur, Jharkhand, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Deoli, Udaipur, Uttarakhand, Saharanpur, Assam, Hapur, West Bengal, Nagpur, Chandigarh, Imphal, Faridabad, Indore, Ranchi, Rewa, Pali, Muzaffarpur, Jhansi, Rohtak, Siliguri, Thane, Darbhanga, Kanpur, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Hisar, Bhopal, Karnataka, Loni, Puducherry, Gujarat, Manipur, Orissa & more\nMost Effective On:\n\nKnee pain\nShoulder pain\nBack pain\nWrist pain\nCervical spondylitis\nArthritic pain", "title": "Sandhi Sudha Plus", "publishedDate": "2013-11-09T13:42:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ACKKrcFcLQ", "description": "Tickseed (Coreopsis)\n\nUncle Steve found this beauty along path near Lake Sycamore in William B.

What is Going On:\nPolice, Firemen, EMS, Ambulance Drivers, Security Guards, Citizen Vigilantes - probably Our Neighborhood Watch Groups -  are Gang Stalking average citizens.\n\n2. The Tactic being Used Is Mobbing which is discussed in a new book by Oxford University Press: Mobbing Causes, Consequences and Solutions by Maureen Duffy and Len Sperry\n\nThe tactic is called mobbing/gang stalking.\n\n3. What we are seeing is reminiscent of the blacklists of the McCarthy Era, RED Squads, and  COINTELPRO.\n\n4. George Bush rescinded anti-COINTELPRO legislation.  Obama's Attorney General hasn\u2019t written new Guidelines for the FBI opening the door for what we are seeing. \n\n5. The ACLU says illegal police surveillance is going on in over thirty states.  What we are seeing is a national problem that requires investigation by our intelligence committees.\n\n6. Bush in Operation Tips tried to get Neighborhood Watch Groups involved in the War on Terror.  What we are seeing is their involvement in Government Gang Stalking - that has nothing to do with terrorism, but rather, is an egregious abuse of government power.\n\n7. The FBI is known for its use of conspicuous surveillance and that is what we are seeing where, not only First Responders and Security Guards are Gang Stalking citizens, but also, Neighborhood Watch Groups using RED cars, RED trucks, wearing or carrying RED.\n\n8. Colonel Anthony Shaffer who wrote Operation Dark Heart told Judge Napolitano on Freedom Watch that our Government uses Neuro-Linguistic Programming in its PSY-OPS program.  One question the intelligence committees need to ask is why did so many firemen \u2013 who Gang Stalk \u2013 signed up for Neuro-Linguistic Programming Workshops where Anchoring \u2013 the technique that forms the core of Government Gang Stalking \u2013 is taught.\n\n9. Techniques used in Government Gang Stalking are constant conspicuous surveillance, Shunning where neighbors are elicited to Gang Stalk to socially isolate targeted citizens, NOISE to harass using power equipment, mobbing in the targeted citizen\u2019s workplace, even intimidation with dogs.  This is a program of UNREMITTING HARASSMENT reminiscent of the Stasi in East Germany.\n\n10.

This is almost exactly 1 year since I did a walkthrough of the mini orchard of 8 trees so I decided to give an updated video on how our fruit trees are doing. We have 2 cherry trees with 5 and 4 grafts of differing types of cherries on each one respectively. The one cherry tree has Montmorency, Sam, Van, Bing, and Rainier cherry limbs grafted onto rootstock.  The other, smaller tree, has all cherry types previously mentioned with the exception of Montmorency.  We purchased both cherry trees from Meijers. We have a Honeycrisp apple tree grafted onto dwarfing rootstock. And a Golden (or Yellow) Delicious apple tree (at least that's what the tag said at the nursery since it produces green cooking apples). It's not too far away to pollinate the honeycrisp apple tree especially since I used a small paint brush to carry the pollen from the green apple tree to the honeycrisp. We had about 15 perfect apples this year from our dwarf honeycrisp. We have 2 bigger peach trees, and since those were planted first, they are the biggest trees of the patch.  They are Harvest (at least that's what the tag said at K-Mart), which is an extremely tasty and sweet peach, and another type tree which has peaches that almost taste like mango (we purchased the mango peach tree from Lowe's). The Stanley Plum and Dwarf Honeycrisp Apple were ordered from Gurneys over the internet a little less than 3 years ago.  It's amazing that those seemingly lifeless sticks that arrived in a rectangular box via UPS are thriving now.  We don't have perfect trees, as some have wounds but the red plum that looked particularly ill in the video a year ago has been replaced by a very hardy Mericrest tree we received through the mail from Summerstone Nursery. That little nectarine tree is tough, we overfertilized it but it lived through that and came on strong the last few months of summer to become a practically established tree in the mini orchard. It's fun to take care of our eight trees, watch them grow, and taste the fruit that they bear. We've had to spray Sevin insecticide to try and deal with our Japanese Beetle problem, but that's all in taking care of our trees. Some trees we've fertilized and some not. Our soil tends to be clay like, but the trees don't complain too much. We harvested apples,  peaches, cherries, and hopefully, next year, we'll even harvest a Stanley Plum and, maybe, if we're lucky, a Mericrest Nectarine. This year was a pretty good harvest for the apples, and we did get ten or so Rainier cherries, but the peaches were all claimed by the Japanese Beetles. This summer I watered our newest addition, the Mericrest Nectarine tree, a lot but didn't really have to water the other trees like last year which was a drought. We hope for the best in the coming seasons. The fruit trees we have are 8 all told.  A Dwarf Honeycrisp Apple, a Stanley Plum, a Harvest Peach, a Peach (which tastes like mango), a Cherry (Frankenstein creation of 5 types of cherries grafted onto rootstock), another Cherry (Frankenstein creation of 4 types of cherries grafted onto rootstock), a Golden (maybe Yellow) Delicious Apple (mismarked at the nursery since it is a green cooking apple), and a Mericrest Nectarine.", "title": "Peach, Cherry, Plum, Apple, Nectarine Tree Mini Orchard - 2nd update", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T14:32:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9A_uR3u4xuU", "description": "Paste your text here and click on \"Next\" to look at this text rewrite man do it's issue.

This video shows the energy transition of a perturbed atom from the first to the second excited state. For this particular case an atom, which is described by a wave in a box with infinitely high walls, is perturbed by a strong periodic external quadratic potential, which is called harmonic potential. \nFor certain other time-cycles the wavefunction becomes \"compressed\" or \"stretched\" by the harmonic potential, depending on its algebraic sign.\nOnly for definite values of the frequency (by a given strength of the perturbation), the atom undergoes a transition from the first to the second excited state, where the excited state begins to oscillate in the harmonic potential. This two-level optical pumping leads to a cyclically oscillation between two adjacent quantum states. Due to the simplicity of the model, quantization of the transition-inducing field and other radiation effects are ignored. \nThe orthodox interpretation of transitions between quantum states in terms of discontinuous jumps is treated as an adjunct to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation itself. In the causal interpretation, the particle position and momentum are well-defined and the transition can be described as a continuous evolution of the quantum particle according to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nIn the causal interpretation, ensembles of particles are characterized by a wavefunction, a quantum potential, an initial position of a particle, and a trajectory. The trajectories are streamlines in the Madelung fluid, regarded as paths of quantum particles that are not directly measurable because of the perturbation caused by the measurement process. In the superposition of states, the energy for each individual quantum particle evolves in a continuous manner. In the causal interpretation there is no evidence of quantum jumps. \nThe numerical methods to calculate the velocity and the quantum potential from a discrete function are, in general, not very stable, but the applied interpolation functions lead to an accurate approximation of the physical event.\nFurther investigations are needed to find precise parameter for the transition process. \nThe trajectories are positioned in (x,t) space. The initial positions of the particles are linearly distributed around the peak inside the wave. The graphics show the particles' positions, the squared wavefunction (red), the quantum potential (yellow), and the harmonic potential (green). The potentials are approximately scaled to fit.\nFor more information see [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6].\n[1] C. Dewdney and M. M.

Phoning Stan at home, Ollie suggests a ruse by which Stan is to convince his wife, who keeps him on a short leash, that he has been called away on business. Stan readily agrees to the idea, assuring Ollie that his wife is \"so dumb she'll never know the difference\".\nMrs. Laurel, eavesdropping on another line, is furious, but continues listening as Stan tells Ollie that he knows where he can get some liquor. His plan is to steal the bottle that his wife has hidden in the house, and later blame the loss on the ice man. Mrs. Laurel immediately launches a scheme of her own: she replaces the alcohol with a non-alcoholic mixture. Stan and Ollie proceed to get \"drunk\" at the nightclub, having a wonderful time. That is, until an angry Mrs. Laurel turns up armed with a shotgun, reveals that their \"liquor\" is merely cold tea, chases them into the street, and demolishes their cab with one well-aimed shot.", "title": "Stan Laurel infectious laughing!", "publishedDate": "2011-11-20T22:30:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BAE_oRlEc8", "description": "A revolution of the classic BlackBerry\u00ae QWERTY Keyboard \u2013 The unique, elegantly-designed BlackBerry QWERTY keyboard continues to provide the very best typing experience.

If you have a nano aquarium less than 30 gallons, one of the easiest ways to outfit your tank with a UV sterilizer is by using JBJ's NanoZapp.\n\nToday, we'll show you how to set one up in only a few short steps.\n\nThe NanoZapp comes with two pieces of vinyl tubing. You'll want to cut these pieces of vinyl tubing to fit for your intended application. We're placing our JBJ NanoZapp in the back of a 29-gallon Oceanic BioCube Aquarium.\n\nOne piece of vinyl tubing will slip on to your return pump. Slide the UV sterilizer, lamp-side down, into the vinyl tubing attached to the pump. Then attach the other piece of vinyl tubing along with an elbow, if necessary. We also recommend securing your vinyl tubing in place with a couple of hose clamps, just to be safe.\n\nLower the pump and UV sterilizer into the back chamber of your aquarium and attach it to your return outlet. Plug in the pump and sterilizer and you're good to go.\n\nIt is typically best to have the UV sterilizer setup as your last method of filtration after the mechanical and biological filters.\n\nThere are many different sizes and styles of UV sterilizers available. Some are submersible and for internal use, like the NanoZapp, while others are designed to be used externally.\n\nIf you have any questions about UV sterilizers, please give us a call at 1-800-566-3474 or leave us a comment below.\n\nTo shop for UV sterilizers and to read product reviews from hobbyists just like you, please visit our website:\nhttp://www.marinedepot.com/Ultraviolet_Sterilizers_for_Saltwater_Aquariums-FIUV-ct.html\n\nTo read a more thorough explanation of how UV sterilizers work and how to set one up yourself, check out this article:\nhttp://kb.marinedepot.com/article.aspx?id=11059", "title": "How to Install a JBJ NanoZapp UV Sterilizer", "publishedDate": "2012-03-20T15:15:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BFgNndRZ-k", "description": "Special Festival Promotion Offer BUFFET + FLYER RIDE @ RIverview Tandoor", "title": "Riverview Tandoor Promotion", "publishedDate": "2011-11-11T06:00:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BFsDSCx_5M", "description": "Proyecto final de los alumnos de Microbiologia basica con el Dr. Fontecha", "title": "Poema al Vibrio Cholerae", "publishedDate": "2008-12-21T19:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BG0DWKD60I", "description": "My freon powerd full auto airsoft gun with flashlight and red dot sight, THIS I POWERED FROM 134 RA FREON SUBSTITUTE, IT IS NOT BAD FOR THE ENVIROMENT.", "title": "Freon powered fullauto airsoft gun", "publishedDate": "2012-01-31T22:11:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BG29_vNOtA", "description": "Ruby-Throated Hummingbird Super Close-up. 1080p", "title": "Ruby-Throated Hummingbird, Carmel, Indiana.

Cross Church is one of the largest churches in America running over 10K on four campuses and multiple mission points.    Their creative team is working to make giving easy by setting up a better more effective online giving system.  This emphasis is one way we are working to keep giving strong over the summer months as we build recurring giving through the online emphasis.\n\nMost churches get the easy part of my opening statement.  But fun?  That is more challenging.  The staff at Cross Church got creative and made a video that allows them to talk about giving in a fun yet effective way.  Here are some of the key things that make this video so effective.\n\nThey use online giving as an approach to keep summer giving constant.  The video begins by saying, \"Summer is here and you may be away soon.  With online giving you can still give.\"\n\nThey used a real live church member.  It wasn't the preacher who everyone thinks has a vested interest in giving but a layperson doing the talking.\n\nThey used a Senior Adult.  I am not sure how old Charles Polston, Papaw, is but you can tell he has some years on him.  The subtle point here is if a Senior Adult can figure out online giving anyone can.\n\nThey show step by step how online giving can be set up.  They make it so easy even a caveman could do it!  Papaw actually shows on the video how to give.\n\nThey use humor to soften the appeal.  At one point Papaw says you can give while you are in your car but not while you are driving!  It shows him with a fishing pole and he tells us we can give while we fish.\n\nThe video finishes with Papaw giving a brief few seconds of testimony of why he gives.  It is important that we not only show people how to give but we tell them why it is important.\n\nAny church can build a video similar to this.  I know what some of you are thinking, that Cross Church is so large that they can easily pull this off.  Today with all the inexpensive video camera's and other technology it is much easier to do something like this than you would think.  What makes this video so effective is that it is an actual church member.  So while the quality of what you produce might not be broadcast quality IF it is your members people will watch it.\n\nStop thinking you can't do this or that and work towards finding your own Papaw to give a positive focus on giving.  Let's make giving easy and fun!\n\nMark Brooks\nFounder and President\nThe Charis Group", "title": "Online Giving Explained By Papaw", "publishedDate": "2012-05-25T04:32:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BVIDewK-cQ", "description": "Produced by Samsung Mobile.", "title": "Silky Whisper by Samsung", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T11:12:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BVIj-InZpQ", "description": "\u8b1d\u5a77\u5a77\u7684CG!

The airplane rolled through a blast fence, an airport perimeter fence, and onto an adjacent roadway, where it struck an automobile before coming to a stop. A child in the automobile was killed, one automobile occupant received serious injuries, and three other automobile occupants received minor injuries. Eighteen of the 103 airplane occupants (98 passengers, 3 flight attendants, and 2 pilots) received minor injuries, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was being operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 and had departed from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Baltimore, Maryland, about 1758 eastern standard time. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the pilots failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplanes autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing.\n\nContributing to the accident were Southwest Airlines 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its on board performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision-making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.  \n\nThe safety issues discussed in this report include the flight crews decisions and actions, the clarity of assumptions used in on board performance computers, SWA policies, guidance, and training, arrival landing distance assessments and safety margins, runway surface condition assessments and braking action reports, airplane-based friction measurements, and runway safety areas.  \n\nClick to subscribe! http://bit.ly/subAIRBOYD", "title": "NTSB Animation Runway Overrun of Southwest Airlines Flight 1248 at Chicago Midway", "publishedDate": "2009-08-07T04:33:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BaKco_8y9Q", "description": "Description", "title": "06 I Am A Palaeontologist", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08T20:23:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BaR58ghs4o", "description": "MAIS student combines disciplines of Public Administration, Climatology & Global Information Systems to meet his educational and career goals.", "title": "Mais Public Admin Climatology GIS", "publishedDate": "2013-01-31T17:52:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BaUoFbf7F0", "description": "Sam Worthington stars in \"Man on a Ledge\".

It doesn't really matter what type \nof liquid you drink, although tea, soup and other warm liquids \nmay feel better than cold ones. As a bonus, warm fluids may \nalso soothe the irritated throat that may result from all that \ncoughing.\n\nWater for a steam treatment \n\nYou can also use water for a steam treatment. Fill the sink \nwith hot water, bend down to it, cover your head with a towel \nand breathe in the steam. Add a few drops of eucalyptus, \npeppermint or rosemary oil, if you have one of them. \nThese help clear and soothe the respiratory passages.\n\nGargle with Warm Saltwater\n\nGargling with saltwater may provide a double dose of relief \nby soothing the inflammation in the throat and by cutting through.\nIt only takes one teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water; \ntoo much salt causes burning in the throat, and too little \nis ineffective. Gargle as often as needed, but be sure to spit \nthe salty water out after gargling.\n\nHoney and Onions\n\nTo relieve the cough that comes from bronchitis, slice an \nonion into a bowl, then cover with honey. Allow to stand \novernight, then remove the onion. Take 1 teaspoon of the \nhoney, four times a day.\n\nOnions are expectorants and help the flow of mucus. You \ncan also eat onions raw, cooked, baked, in soups and \nstews or as seasoning.\n\nFor more information please visit:\n\nhttp://bronchitis-home-remedy.lir25.com\n\nAt  Home Remedies for Bronchitis\nbronchitis cure\nbronchitis cures\nbronchitis treatments\nbronchitis treatment\ntreating bronchitis \nbronchitis remedies\nrecurring bronchitis\nbronchitis natural cure\nbronchitis natural cures\nbest cure for bronchitis\nremedy for a cough\nbronchitis natural remedy\nbronchitis doctor\nsinus infection home remedy\nhome remedies bronchitis\nbronchitis remedies at home", "title": "At  Home Remedies for Bronchitis", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T15:32:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Bejel2PSY8", "description": "http://www.parlance-project.eu", "title": "Parlance Mandarin System", "publishedDate": "2014-01-20T20:42:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Bf6yUssr8Q", "description": "http://www.YARN.com -- Learn how to knit using Mesh Ruffle Yarns with WEBS education manager Tina McElmoyl.\n\nThe yarn featured in this video is Knitting Fever Flounce.

However, they will not move under the same mode as Airbus aircrafts. \n       \nThe captain Lee Kang Kuk was supposed to keep a hand on the throttle levers to feel them move, and he reportedly did so on and off.  However, he was not alarmed by the lack of movement as he thought the auto-throttle would maintain a safe minimum speed with no signal.      \n\nAccording to Bloomberg Businessweek, the pilots decided to add power to prevent the collision only 8.5 seconds after the initial speed warning. The plane lost lift as it was almost 65 kilometers per hour slower than its target speed.\n\nThe plane was carrying 291 passengers and 16 crew members.Two passengers who were killed in the accident were 16-year-old girls from eastern China.", "title": "Asiana pilot set the engines to idle before crash", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T10:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9BtSkbMPNu8", "description": "Tungsten Wedding Rings Break.

Originating as a guerilla garden project adjacent to a bus stop in South London, we transform once-forgotten spaces into thriving neighbourhood hubs that are celebrated by local residents and users of the bus route.\n\nThe Edible Bus Stop germinated from the need for green space within our cities and urban communities. We understand that a brutal landscape makes for a brutal outlook. Therefore, we explore high-end aesthetics at lower-end budgets to create garden designs that promote harmonious community growing spaces, demonstrating that good food and good design is not socially exclusive.\n\nOur objective is to create a network of gardens whereby skills and resources are shared via our Edible Bus Stop umbrella organization. We work closely with communities to provide them with the necessary framework to utilise neglected public spaces in a productive fashion while incorporating the principals of design to raise their profile. To ensure the longevity of this project, we seek committed sponsors to take the concept across London and the United Kingdom.\n\nAnimation by Room60\nhttp://room60.net", "title": "The Edible Bus Stop: Community Gardens from Neglected Sites", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T08:05:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9C59CdBaFmc", "description": "http://www.efsanefrm.com\nhttp://yonja.com/ural1990\n\nyep yeni 2007 model g\u00f6k\u00e7e k\u0131rg\u0131z \u015fark\u0131s\u0131 s\u00fcper bi\u015fi dinlemeyen pi\u015fman olur\n\n\n------------------------------\nbunda sonrasini okuma zaman kaybi olur sadece bu klibi bulmak icin olan bazi kelimeler :)\n---------------------------\n\n--------\ng\u00f6k\u00e7e a\u015fk \u015fiir nefret g\u00fczel s\u00f6zler kalpsiz ayr\u0131l\u0131k sevgi g\u00f6k\u00e7e k\u0131rg\u0131z video clip aldat\u0131lmak aldatmak sevmek sevilmek hay\u0131r..!\nilhan irem ayr\u0131l\u0131k nefret \u015fiir seni seviyorum ya hayy bekled dedin bekledim sev dedin sevdim ya sen ne yapt\u0131n a\u015fk ac\u0131s\u0131 sensizlik nefret intikam ceza \n\u015e\u00fckriye tutkun sukriye tutkun g\u00fcz\u00fcm yene kadar Serhat Esma Ask hikayesi :P En Sevgiliye G\u00fczel s\u00f6zler,a\u015fk s\u00f6zleri,G\u00fczel S\u00f6zler, Duygusal A\u015fk \u015eiirleri,sevgi s\u00f6zleri,Bur\u00e7lar,sevgi,Cep mesaj,A\u015fk S\u00f6zleri,Sevgi S\u00f6zleri,\u00d6zlem \u015eiirleri, Bur\u00e7lar, Haz\u0131r Sms S\u00f6zleri,A\u015fk fal\u0131,a\u015fk s\u00f6zleri,dogum g\u00fcn\u00fc \u015fiirleri A\u015fk,Sevgi,g\u00fczel s\u00f6zler,arkada\u015f,bur\u00e7lar,haberler,\u015fiir,g\u00fcz el s\u00f6zler,M\u00fczik,oyun,e-kart,gazeteler,bebek isimleri,r\u00fcya tabirleri,r\u00fcya yorumlar\u0131,Sohbet - chat, sohbet, \u00e7et, chatsohbet, sohbet odalar\u0131, \u00e7et odas\u0131, sevgililer g\u00fcn\u00fc, sevgililer gunu mesajlari, sevgililer, sohpet, cet, Televizyon, sohbet, sohbet.net, sohbet odalar\u0131, sohbet odalari, chat, chat odalar\u0131, chat odalari, muhabbet, muhabbet odalar\u0131, muhabbet odalari.

This is Tony\u2019s recap of the discussions. \n\nThe National Assembly for Wales is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people, makes laws for Wales and holds the Welsh Government to account. One of the ways the National Assembly for Wales holds the Welsh Government to account is through committees, such as the Health and Social Care Committee, who are currently reviewing legal highs in Wales. \n\nMembers of the Health and Social Care Committee met with service providers from across north Wales including service providers from the police, NHS, and local councils to discuss their Inquiry into New Psychoactive Substances. You can find more information about this inquiry here: http://senedd.assemblywales.org/mgConsultationDisplay.aspx?ID=135  \n\nThe north Wales visit was held simultaneously with an event held in south Wales. Here is a link to all of the videos taken during this inquiry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAiwHW5TKfkGo7P-NpsxYme-XAO_ucUQ_\n\nThe Committee will now consider their findings and write a report which will include recommendations to the Welsh Government.

But what does that actually mean?\n \nThe human eye is constructed like a camera - with a clear lens in the front. The lens is located just behind the iris. It is contained in an elastic capsule. This capsule will serve as the housing for the new lens. All light that enters the eye has to pass through this lens.\n \nAs we age, this lens can become cloudy and gradually lose its ability to focus properly. This is called a cataract.If left untreated, a cataract can grow steadily worse - interfering more and more with your vision.\nGenerally, replacing a cataract with an artificial lens is a simple procedure.\n \nIt usually involves a single incision in the white of the eye. Through this single opening the cataract is removed and the artificial lens is inserted.\n\nYour Procedure:\n\nOn the day of your operation, you will be asked to put on a surgical gown.\n\nYou may receive a sedative by mouth and an intravenous line may be put in.\n\nAnd you'll given eye drops to dilate, or open, the pupil.\n\nYou will then be transferred to the operating table.\n\nTo begin, the surgeon will use a special instrument to gently hold the eyelids apart.\n\nThen the surgeon will apply an antiseptic solution to the skin around the eye before injecting a local anesthetic.\n\n\nWhile the anesthetic is taking effect, the surgeon will position a microscope in front of the eye.\n\nBy now, the pupil will be fully open, or dilated.\n\nWhen the operative field is numb, the surgeon will use the microscope to help make a very small incision just 3 millimeters above the iris. The lens is located just behind the iris contained in the elastic capsule.\n\nNext the surgeon will open the top of the capsule and remove the lens. Most likely, your doctor will use a small probe which vibrates at a high frequency.\n\nThe probes vibrations break the old lens into microscopic pieces which can then be drawn out with gentle suction.\n\n\nThrough the small incision, the surgeon will then insert the new lens.\n\nThe lens is actually rolled up inside a special injector, designed to fit through the small incision made above the iris.\n\nWith the tip of the injector inside the eye, the surgeon slowly injects the new lens where it unfolds into position.\n\nBecause of the small size of the incision, often your surgeon will complete surgery without putting in any stitches.\n\nVision will gradually improve during normal healing over a period of 5 to 8 weeks.\n\nPatient Education Company", "title": "Cataract - Small Incision Surgery  PreOp\u00ae Patient Education Medical Video", "publishedDate": "2014-02-09T15:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9CMNj5vhnhM", "description": "We rasie and sell a wide selection of trees and plants from our Bucks County farm.

Waking up to their din is a real jungle experience!).

Hundreds of bird species live in this part of Costa Rica (there are over 300 bird species identified in the immediate area), as well as sloth, iguana, anteaters, iridescent butterflies and myriad varieties of vegetation. Our immediate neighborhood is a principle stronghold of the rare and endangered Squirrel monkey and Scarlet Macaw, and offers more opportunity to view these rare animals than anywhere in Central America.
