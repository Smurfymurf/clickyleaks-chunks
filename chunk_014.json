Washington's ability to guide his men through a winter of disease, deprivation, death and desertion imbued the troops with enough grit and determination to see them through the remaining seven years of the Revolutionary War and emerge victorious. Washington also used his time here wisely, undertaking a training program that united the military tactics of 13 separate fighting forces into one U.S. Army.\n\nValley Forge National Historical Park, the 3,500-acre site of that encampment, remains a vibrant symbol of determination and the price that must be paid to win and retain freedom. Parks staff and volunteers run a steady calendar of historic presentations, lectures, demonstrations and children's programming to ensure that its key role in the formation of the U.S. is never forgotten. \n\nFor shoppers The King of Prussia Mall, the largest retail-shopping complex on the East Coast of the USA, features upscale items for the trendiest fashionistas. Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom's, Neiman-Marcus, Tiffany & Co., and Williams-Sonoma are just a few of the 400-plus stores in store for visitors. The Mall features a number of after-hour events and even provides a personal shopping service, guaranteed to become an instant gal-pal for an outing of fashion and fun. Just a few miles away is Philadelphia Premium Outlets with more than 150 outlet stores and savings of 25 to 65 percent every day on brand name designers. The collection of stores - really more of a European-style promenade encourages wandering and chatting while hunting for bargains. \n\nFifty-five miles of biking trails traverse the county and even connect Center City, Philadelphia to Valley Forge National Historical Park via the 22-mile Schuylkill River Trail. At the Park, 20 miles of multipurpose trails traverse rolling hills dotted with replica soldier huts. The 19-mile Perkiomen Trail leads north to Green Lane Park where visitors can rent boats and fish in the spring and summer and catch weekly concerts.\n\nFor adventure seekers there is Spring Mountain Adventures. Open year-round, Spring Mountain is an adrenaline addict's dream offering skiing, snowboarding, zip line canopy tours above the treetops, geo-caching and even extreme biking. To the mountain's east side, Woodside Lodge at Spring Mountain nestles in its quiet setting aside the Perkiomen Creek. This completely remodeled B&B was a former 1920s era inn, and every bit of its original charm (glass doorknobs, transoms above every door) has been retained.\n\n-----------------------\n\nValley Forge Tourism & Convention Board is a private, non-profit membership sales and marketing organization which actively promotes the Valley Forge area and Montgomery County as a convention site and leisure visitor destination by promoting patronage of its member hotels, restaurants, attractions and services. The Board represents more than 300 member businesses throughout Southeast Pennsylvania. The Valley Forge Tourism & Convention Board was established as the Valley Forge Convention and Visitors Bureau by the Montgomery County Commissioners in 1963, making it the officially chartered tourism promotion agency of Montgomery County. It was an agency of Montgomery County until 1999, when the County Commissioners voted to privatize the bureau, while maintaining fiduciary oversight through appointment of the agency's volunteer board of directors. Funding comes from a combination of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania grants, membership dues and a tax imposed on visitors occupying the County's more than 7,500 hotel rooms. The Board does not receive funding from Montgomery County.\n\nRebeca Nesselrode, Reportera de Viajes, Unravel Travel TV spoke to John Golden, Director of Communications, Valley Forge CVB about what there is to do and see in the Valley Forge area and Montgomery County area.\n\nValley Forge CVB  valleyforge.org", "title": "John Golden, Director of Communications, Valley Forge CVB - Unravel Travel TV", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T10:42:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ozygzIiqBg", "description": "Armored Warfare | http://armoredwarfare.com\n\nWe are excited to present to you the M1128 MGS Stryker, a marvel of modern Armored Fighting Vehicle Technology.

Dyraele's work is a meditation on the story of Brightland's Rebellion from the Dominion's point of view. We consider our version a ballad one might have heard anywhere loyal Dominion citizens took shelter from the Cassian Civil War - the conflict that shook the very foundations of their empire. In the era of the WildStar game, it would be considered an old standard, but not one you'd be likely to hear around an Exile campfire.\n\nSee the original poem here: \nhttp://www.wildstar-central.com/index.php?threads/a-traitors-whim.854/\n\nLearn more about WildStar and the lore that inspired the lyrics:\nhttp://www.wildstar-online.com/en/blog/wildstar_wednesday_brightlands_rebellion.php\n\nAnd if you're watching this in the month of Movember 2012 and could detect the wispy hairs on Cory's upper lip when the light was just right, please consider a donation to Carbine's Team WildStache! http://us.movember.com/team/470629\n\n\nYou can find more information about WildStar and sign up for beta at: http://www.WildStar-Online.com/ \n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/WildStarOnline \nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Team_WildStar \nWe're hiring: http://www.carbinestudios.com \n\nWatch the WildStar videos in your language:\nDeutsch: http://goo.gl/7b2bTs \nFran\u00e7ais\u200e: http://goo.gl/q8ibea", "title": "A Traitor's Whim - Music Video", "publishedDate": "2012-11-19T23:03:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p57YvMFhh4", "description": "Tarns Rest\n\n-\nCreated with AquaSoft SlideShow for YouTube: http://www.aquasoft.net", "title": "Tarns Rest", "publishedDate": "2012-05-22T01:13:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p5TMwsSNc0", "description": "cheval de sport a vendre 4ans", "title": "ukase de martinvast cso 2", "publishedDate": "2012-06-10T20:57:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p5g90a0vGY", "description": "Watch in HD for best quality.\n\nAlbum: See You On The Ground\nYear: 2011\nGenre: Melodic Death Metal\nCountry: Germany\n\nLink to the original upload:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofrdsL-g2u0", "title": "Deadend In Venice - Long Way Home", "publishedDate": "2011-03-21T12:56:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p5iTTYbtH0", "description": "TYBG for this rare 10Day left over.\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ForeverGambinoo\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/ForeverGambinoo\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Few people know that hypothyroidism really isn't something wrong with your thyroid but it's more about the food you eat and the stress and the environment you're living in. The thyroid is more like a sentinel organ that is the first to go down when the body is dysfunctioning. \n\nStep 1 is to stop looking at the thyroid by itself. The stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline are required for the thyroid to make appropriate hormones but too much of them will cause the conversion of thyroid hormone not to take place. This is why it is important to manage your stress. \n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR MORE HEALTHY VIDEO TIPS AND REPORTS!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=undergroundwellness\n\nFREE STUFF!\nChasing Symptoms video e-course: http://www.chasingsymptoms.com\n\nLET'S CONNECT!\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/undergroundwellness\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/ugwellness\nBlogTalk Radio: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/undergroundwellness\nThe Blog: http://www.undergroundwellness.com\nUW on iTunes - http://bit.ly/uwitunes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njerfitup", "title": "Losing Fat with Hypothyroidism", "publishedDate": "2012-01-26T20:03:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p87D1HkidU", "description": "fasha sudah terima pembalasan", "title": "Nora Danish perli Fasha", "publishedDate": "2010-06-28T06:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-p9Dx-AHClg", "description": "Cute Talking Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog - Big Misunderstanding - funny dog video.\nPuppy goes to the Vet for neutering...

The new law puts a cap on purchased pseudoephedrine to 28.8 grams per year.\n\n\"If someone is buying over and over again, they'll have to have a doctor's prescription in order to purchase over that 28 gram (limit),\" said Sgt. Daniel Jones, of Chattanooga police.\n\nThe 28-gram restriction is about five months' worth of the maximum dose of Sudafed. A federal computer system currently keeps track of people who buy pseudoephedrine, where they buy and how often.\n\n\"It's a really good approach because most patients that really need some, really aren't going to need that much,\" said Hemi Patel, a pharmacist at Hamilton Discount Pharmacy. \"Nobody can sell the pseudoephedrine without logging on and registering that person who's buying the pseudoephedrine into the computer.\"\n\nThe new limit of less than 6 grams cut the allowed amount by a third from the 2005 law, which permitted 9 grams of pseudoephedrine. Meth investigators said the new law won't fix the meth problem, but they said it's one more step to make smarter traps for in-state meth cookers.\n\nIt also helps deter people who attempt to beat the tracking system in place, authorities said.\n\n\"We also call it smurfing, where someone will send someone else out to go and purchase pseudoephedrine for them, so that will also let us know who those people are as well,\" said Jones. \n\nAnyone who needs pseudoephedrine when they're sick can still get it, but they will need a prescription if they need more than 28 grams a year under the new anti-meth law.\n\nHamilton and McMinn counties rank in the top 10 for meth lab seizures in 2012, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. \n\nBy Briona Arradondo", "title": "New Tennessee Anti-Meth Law in Effect at Pharmacies", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T21:45:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pDd-YdxVS0", "description": "Only Bodies left Behind", "title": "Why-Scum Ft Razakel", "publishedDate": "2010-10-31T04:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pDpSzQjpHE", "description": "Demonstration of Manageability Commander Mesh Edition, an Intel AMT management console that can log into http://meshcentral.homeip.net.

People who find themselves desperate to lose fat are often prone to take a lot more risks (something that I aim to help you avoid). The truth is that with some basic principles you can make some serious progress toward fat loss without major effort. Ordinarily a client will come in my experience looking for some suggestions that will help them lose some weight quickly. I will be always happy to tell them my \"secret\" tips which might be always surprisingly powerful. In fact, many people are finding these tips to make a simple ten pound variation as they get started on a brand new program. You might factor that these suggestions are very hi-tech or mysterious, but usually, they are basic principles that I've seen successful continuously. Here they are\n\nhttp://is.gd/1juFIw\n  \nENTER THE FATLOSS FACTOR AND START LOSING WEIGHT TODAY\n\nhttp://is.gd/1juFIw\n\n\n1* Avoid \"white\" foodstuff. This includes white loaf of bread, pastas, many whole grain cereal, and even cracker-type snacks. Think about some other white issues too like flour, spud products, rice, and even processed milk as well as cheese products. A number of white foods which can be OK for you to take in are cauliflowers, fish, as well as chicken.\n\n2* Ditch the sodas and other beverages that have calories, glucose, or even artificial sweeteners. I don't want you to drink much coffee sometimes. Creamer? No. It's white, isn't the idea? I want you to take in the vast majority the weight of your body throughout ounces of water. Which means if you weigh 250 pounds, you should be taking in 125 ounces water every day. This will be needed for getting the fat loss procedure in gear.\n \n3* I've already taken you off white products, now you need to do away with wheat products. I don't care if the package says \"whole wheat\" on it or not: it has to go. Check the ingredients of everything you're eating and if it has wheat in it, don't eat it.\n \nThese three rules are pretty easy to follow, aren't they? Sure, you'll have to adjust your habits a little bit, but it really won't be very hard once you get started. If you consistently adhere to these hints, you will be surprised at the progress you make in just a couple weeks.\nBegin making even more progress in your fat loss program: get the Fat Loss Factor today.\n\nhttp://is.gd/1juFIw\n\nweight loss online\nweighwatchers\ncant lose weight\nlosing weight after pregnancy\nweight wat\nweight waters\nweight wathcers\nlose abdominal fat\neasy fat loss\nhealthy weight loss diet\nacai weight loss\ndiabetes weight loss\nweight loss hypnotherapy\npermanent weight loss\nmetabolic weight loss\nlaser weight loss\neasy weight loss tips\nweight loss houston\nphysician weight loss\nbiggest loser weight loss\nbest weight loss plan\nsauna weight loss\ncolon cleanse weight loss\nchristian weight loss\nweight loss menu\nwater and weight loss\ngreen tea and weight loss\nfree weight loss plan\nvegetarian weight loss diet\ninstant weight loss\nliquid diet weight loss\nweight loss body wraps\nweight loss retreats\nrapid weight loss diets\nweight loss diets for women\nvegetables for weight loss\nbest weight loss shakes, \nphysicians weight loss center\ntops weight loss\ntips on how to lose weight fast\nmeal replacement shakes for weight loss\nfree online weight loss programs\nhow to drop weight fast\nsonakshi sinha weight loss\nsonam kapoor weight loss", "title": "The Fat Loss Factor weightloss secrets", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T11:08:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pF57TC2LD4", "description": "Well.. here we go again.. this time on \"gaby's casual clothes\".. i'm using a different pairs of pants, tops, and 2 different cardigans, hope you like this video too", "title": "Gaby's causal outfit 2", "publishedDate": "2010-07-15T04:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pF6axZ5luc", "description": "eye squint operation, limbal incision", "title": "Strabismus surgery, limbal incision, p 4/56", "publishedDate": "2010-02-07T17:02:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pFF-vFIUyw", "description": "", "title": "\u30ad\u30b8\uff08Phasianus versicolor\uff09\uff56\uff53\u30d8\u30d3", "publishedDate": "2010-05-23T13:38:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pFVA16hU6k", "description": "Pacific Halibut are massive huge, gigantic and delicious sea monsters!

As a nonprofit, it earns more than the Y, the Red Cross, Goodwill, the Salvation Army or Catholic Charities - yet it stands as one of the greatest profit-generating commercial advertising, entertainment and media enterprises ever created.\"\n\nWhy Congress will never take back the NFL's tax break\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/15/why-congress-will-never-take-back-the-nfls-huge-tax-break/\n\"Perhaps the most famous tax break in America is the one bestowed by Congress on the NFL. It's famous for its seeming illogic - the NFL, hugely profitable, being called a \"nonprofit.\"\"\n\nTax-exempt? The NFL's nonprofit status by the numbers\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/id/101996109#.\n\"The National Football League is embroiled in drama over the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal, with some voices calling for Commissioner Roger Goodell to be fired. The controversy overall has stirred curiosity about how the NFL is run, and how it makes money.\"\n\nShould the NFL Lose Its Tax-Exempt Status?\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/nfl-tax-exempt-status-rootstrikers-roger-goodell\n\"Times are good for the National Football League. Viewership is up. For the 47th year in a row, Harris Interactive named pro football the most popular sport in America. And with overall revenues north of $9 billion, the NFL is the most lucrative sports league on the planet.\"\n\nExamining NFL's tax-exempt status\nhttp://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9342479/examining-nfl-tax-exempt-status-challenged-us-senator-tom-coburn\n\"Sen. Tom Coburn has proposed an amendment to the Marketplace Fairness Act that would end the NFL's exemption from taxation. That's right -- the $10 billion-a-year NFL is a tax-exempt organization, as is the NHL and the PGA Tour.\"\n\nThe NFL Is Not a Nonprofit\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/the_nfl_should_lose_its_tax_exempt_status_the_league_is_not_a_nonprofit.html\n\"The National Football League generates about $9.5 billion in revenue each year. It is, by Forbes' estimate, the most valuable sports league in the world. Its commissioner, Roger Goodell, makes $44 million in a year. And yet, the NFL's head office has long been allowed to operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit-as if its sole purpose for existence wasn't to extract wads of cash from the wallets of American sports fans.\"\n\nThe NY Times Revisits NFL Nonprofitness as Football Season Begins\nhttps://nonprofitquarterly.org/policysocial-context/24781-the-ny-times-revisits-nfl-nonprofitness-as-football-season-begins.html\n\"As our readers know by now, the NFL is a nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(6) of the revenue codes. This is the classification set aside for trade associations-groups that are in business to promote and create a positive business environment for their particular trade. And there are a lot of them.\"\n\nWatch More:\nDNews: Just how common is domestic violence?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbG3FIGk_w&list=UUzWQYUVCpZqtN93H8RR44Qw\n\nSubscribe Now!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testtubenetwork\n_________________________\n\nTestTube's new daily show is committed to answering the smart, inquisitive questions we have about life, society, politics and anything else happening in the news.

Thermophilic eubacteria are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.\nThermophiles are found in various geothermally heated regions of the Earth, such as hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park (see image) and deep sea hydrothermal vents, as well as decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost.\nUnlike other types of bacteria, thermophiles can survive at much hotter temperatures, whereas other bacteria would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures.\nAs a prerequisite for their survival, thermophiles contain enzymes that can function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in molecular biology (for example, heat-stable DNA polymerases for PCR), and in washing agents.\n\nSubscribe to stay updated and educated. .\n\nMust Watch: \n\n'Pulsars and Quasars' - Learn about the monsters of the universe: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzGJTEsFJd8sZrnHsxs08dQ3\n\n'Science Fact or Science Fiction?' - Find out what's real and what's made up in science and space: - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHxkSj5pzt5zY-fqgVRd8gz\n\n'Top 10 Biggest Blasts' - A countdown of the biggest explosions ever to occur: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzGPSTYh_OpFziFGwORWUCxZ\n\n'Time Travel' - Is it possible?: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHOv_AAQcWVjFIh25yPNsrF\n\n'7 Wonders of the Solar System' - Our Solar System isn't as boring as you think - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzHxyG69NPYa15a-NLd4wCR3\n\n'Black Holes' - The end, the infinite, the all consuming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLke8o-yBwNzE9XolnbnHMdiJe7sCMCIbp", "title": "Thermophiles of the early Earth HD", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T02:49:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pht9D8wPB0", "description": "Veja mais:\nwww.ibigrao.loja2.com.br\nou\nhttp://ibigrao.loja2.com.br/3479855-CRANBERRY-SECA-500g-INFECCOES-URINARIAS-DOENCAS-CARDIOVASCUL", "title": "Cranberry Para que Serve Benef\u00edcios Como Usar Indica\u00e7\u00f5es Infec\u00e7\u00f5es Urin\u00e1ria Cardiovascular", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T17:44:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-pi3voXLZYE", "description": "Adobe Flash Professional\nAdobe Flash Professional is a multimedia authoring program used to create content for the Adobe Engagement Platform, such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.\nAdobe Flash Professional CS5 is one of the leading programs for creating interactive contents that can be displayed on smartphones, tablets, desktops, television sets, etc. With this application you'll be able to produce contents regardless of the size and the resolution of the space on which it is viewed.\n\nThis important content design and development product has integration with other programs of the genre, such as Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, among others.

This theory is supported by several recent studies by the Pickar lab and by findings that low back pain patients have altered proprioceptive input from muscle spindles. Recent work has also shown that that spinal manipulation modifies the discharge of Group I and II afferents. This has been accomplished by recording single-unit activity in muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ afferents in an animal model during manipulation.\n\nA second mechanism is that osteopathic spinal manipulation, by mechanically opening the intravertebral foramina (IVF), decreases pressure on the dorsal roots. Substantial evidence shows that the dorsal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia are susceptible to the effects of mechanical compression. Compressive loads as low as 10 mg applied to dorsal roots increase the discharge of Group I, II, III and IV afferents. This compression can also alter non--impulse-based mechanisms (eg, axoplasmic transport) and cause edema and hemorrhage in the dorsal root. Spinal manipulation mechanically decreases the pressure in the IVF by gapping the facet joints and opening the IVF. For instance, the synovial space of the lumbar facet joints increases by about 0.7 mm in individuals receiving manipulation. This doesn't seem like much, but as with any therapy there is usually a course of care involved. Even in moderate stenosis patients treated by osteopaths typically see significant pain reduction following a period of 1-2 weeks of treatment.\n\nA third mechanism is based on findings that persistent alterations in normal sensory input resulting from an injury can increases the excitability of neuronal circuits in the spinal cord. Osteopathic spinal manipulation works by applying non-noxious mechanical inputs to these circuits. This involves mechanisms similar to the pain-gate theory proposed by Melzack and Wall wherein activation of A-\u03b1 and A-\u03b2 fibers can reduce chronic pain and increase pain threshold levels. This is supported by studies where spinal manipulation of the lumbar region decreases central pain processing as measured via pin-prick tests. Additional studies have shown a reduction in central pain sensitivity after spinal manipulation using graded pressure and noxious cutaneous electrical stimulation.\n\nA fourth mechanism involves \u03b2-endorphin mechanisms. Studies have shown increases in beta-endorphin levels after spinal manipulation but not after control interventions. \nFifth mechanism: Substantial evidence also shows that spinal manipulation activates paraspinal muscle reflexes and alters motoneuron excitability. These effects are still being studied and appear to differ depending on whether performed on patients in pain or pain-free subjects.\n\nA sixth mechanism involves inhibition of somatosomatic reflexes by alterations in muscle spindle input produced by osteopathic spinal manipulation. It is thought that spinal manipulation may normalize spindle biomechanics and improve muscle spindle discharge.\n\nLastly, in humans, osteopathic manual treatment can decrease heart rate and blood pressure while increasing vagal afferent activity as measured by heart-rate variability. Manual therapies in rats have been shown to produce an inhibitory effect on the cardiovascular excitatory response and reduce both blood pressure and heart rate. Manual therapies such as osteopathic soft tissue therapy have been shown to impact behavioral manifestations associated with chronic activation of the HPA axis such as anxiety and depression, while decreasing plasma, urinary, and salivary cortisol and urinary corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI). Manual stimulation in rats has been shown to significantly increase glucocorticoid receptor gene expression which enhanced negative feedback inhibition of HPA activity and reduced post-stress secretion of ACTH and glucocorticoid.\n\nNational University of Medical Sciences (www.numss.com) offered two degree programs in osteopathy; a doctor of osteopathy (DO) and a bachelor of science in osteopathy (BSc).

The maximum carapace size, or shell length, for painted turtles is or 25 cm (10 in.).[1] Its shell is used to protect it from its predators.\n\nThe skin of an adult Painted Turtle's head, neck, feet and tail, and the carapace-edge (marginal) scutes have a red and yellow striped design that gives the appearance of having been hand-painted. The plastron, depending on the subspecies, can be entirely yellowish or yellowish-orange, mostly yellowish with a dark pattern in the center, or may have a bold, elaborate pattern of yellow, orange, red and dark gray.[1] The background skin tone of the painted turtle varies from olive green to solid black.[2] The Painted turtle is the only species in the genus Chrysemys.

Aujourd'hui, le scoutisme et le guidisme comptent plus de 38 millions de membres dans 217 pays et territoires, de toutes les religions et de toutes les nationalit\u00e9s, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par plusieurs associations scoutes au niveau mondial.\nLe scoutisme est un mouvement de jeunesse reposant sur l'apprentissage de valeurs fortes, telles que la solidarit\u00e9, l'entraide et le respect. Son but est d'aider le jeune individu \u00e0 former son caract\u00e8re et \u00e0 construire sa personnalit\u00e9 tout en contribuant \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement physique, mental et spirituel afin qu'il puisse \u00eatre un citoyen actif dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Pour atteindre cet objectif, le scoutisme s'appuie sur des activit\u00e9s pratiques dans la nature, mais aussi des activit\u00e9s en int\u00e9rieur, destin\u00e9es plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un apprentissage intellectuel. Le scoutisme s'appuie sur une loi et une promesse et est souvent la\u00efque, bien qu'il existe des groupes religieux.\nLes membres sont appel\u00e9s \u00ab scouts \u00bb (suivant le terme anglais international d'origine) ou parfois \u00ab \u00e9claireurs \u00bb (sa traduction) dans les pays francophones. Au sens strict, ces termes d\u00e9signent les jeunes gens \u00e2g\u00e9s de 11 \u00e0 14 ans ou de 11 \u00e0 17 ans (lorsque le mouvement est dit unitaire). Au sens plus large, les encadrants, les animateurs ou les anciens membres sont des scouts, ou \u00ab restent des scouts dans l'\u00e2me \u00bb. Dans les pays francophones, les plus jeunes sont commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s des \u00ab castors \u00bb, \u00ab hirondelles \u00bb, \u00ab louveteaux \u00bb, \u00ab louvettes \u00bb, \u00ab jeannettes \u00bb ou \u00ab exploratrices \u00bb et les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s des \u00ab scouts \u00bb, \u00ab \u00e9claireurs \u00bb \u00ab guides \u00bb, \u00ab pionniers \u00bb, \u00ab caravelles \u00bb, \u00ab compagnons \u00bb, \u00ab routiers \u00bb, \u00ab a\u00een\u00e9s \u00bb, etc. Le \u00ab scout \u00bb est connu du public par le port d'un foulard et d'une tenue plus ou moins compl\u00e8te.\nLe guidisme est l'\u00e9quivalent f\u00e9minin du scoutisme. \u00c0 partir des ann\u00e9es 1970, certains mouvements scouts ont fait le choix de la mixit\u00e9 (ou \u00ab co-\u00e9ducation \u00bb) dans les unit\u00e9s, tandis que d'autres conservent aujourd'hui des unit\u00e9s exclusivement masculines ou f\u00e9minines.\n\nEn France, il existe pr\u00e8s de 50 groupements se r\u00e9clamant du mouvement scout.

A senior police officer described it as one of the most \"appalling incidents\" he has ever investigated.\n\nAt Chelmsford Crown Court, Webster pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm against both brothers and was jailed for 22 months.\n\nMartin admitted actual bodily harm against Joseph Morrell and was jailed for nine months.\n\nThe horrific drama happened in February this year after Webster, of Coggeshall, and Martin of Colchester, approached the two brothers to ask about trains before a row broke out.\n\nMr Morrell, from Ipswich, was attacked on the platform whilst waiting for a train with his brother and a friend.\n\nIn the CCTV footage Joseph, 28, can be seen coming to the aid of his vulnerable sibling, only to be attacked in a horrifying assault which also saw him thrown onto the track by Webster.\n\nSickeningly, he was attacked again as he desperately tried to clamber to the safety of the platform.\n\nWebster then threw Mr Morrell, who is registered blind and is profoundly deaf, onto the tracks before punching him in the face as he tried to climb back onto the platform.\n\nJudge David Turner QC said it had been a \"disgraceful episode\" and labelled the pair's actions \"manifestly dangerous\".\n\nHe said: \"This is exactly the sort of thing that terrifies members of the travelling public late at night.\"\n\nSpeaking afterwards Detective Constable Alan Reed of British Transport Police said: \"This is one of the most appalling incidents I have investigated.\n\n\"Webster and Martin showed a savage disregard for their victims, and one of the brothers is still suffering from the injuries sustained to his foot.\n\n\"It is no exaggeration to say the brothers could have been killed after being thrown onto the tracks.\n\n\"I would like to pay tribute to the victims, who have shown great dignity following what was a terrifying ordeal for them.\n\n\"I hope the sentence will provide them with some sense of closure, although in truth, the impact this has had on both of them is likely to remain with them for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nThe court heard on Wednesday that Mr Morrell spent six weeks on crutches and was off work for six months.\n\nHe now walks with a limp and has been told the foot injury may take two years to heal and may need further surgery.\n\n\nCCTV Shows Moment Blind and Deaf Man was Pushed Onto Railway Tracks\nCCTV Shows Moment Blind and Deaf Man was Pushed Onto Railway Tracks\nCCTV Shows Moment Blind and Deaf Man was Pushed Onto Railway Tracks", "title": "CCTV Shows Moment Blind and Deaf Man was Pushed Onto Railway Tracks", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T14:13:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-qSSDLILw04", "description": "short video showing how fast and flat the Salient Arms tier 1 Glock 19 shoots", "title": "Salient Arms International Glock 19 tier 1 gopro", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T22:30:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-qTAeVGl_e8", "description": "To donate / get involved visit:\nhttp://riftvalleymarathon.com/donation/\n\nhttps://facebook.com/KenyanHighJump !!!\n\nThis is at a high school track meet in the Rift Valley of Kenya in the town of Mosoriot.

As with many professions, salaries for public insurance adjusters vary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators in 2010 was $28.11 per hour. This translates into an average salary in the $58,000 range.\n\nHowever, computing an average public adjuster salary is a little trickier than most. Unlike insurance company adjusters who earn a salary paid by an employer, most public adjusters are paid a percentage of their successfully handled insurance settlements. This makes a public adjuster salary less predictable from one year to the next.\n\nFor the most part, public insurance adjusters are independent business professionals though some work for public adjusting firms. As self-employed business professionals, public adjusters must run their own businesses, pay self-employment taxes, acquire their own health insurance, market their businesses, and so on.\n\nDepending on where you live, which areas of insurance you specialize in, and whether or not you choose to get licensed in other states, the potential public adjuster salary can be quite lucrative.  \n\n\n~ Stephen Hadhazi, Public Adjuster", "title": "Public Adjuster Salary", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T01:46:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-qcTmulhIok", "description": "Don't miss another Gag - Subscribe!: http://goo.gl/wJxjG\n\nThis epic grandpa has a clever way to rob his liquor!\n\nCan't click annotations?\nMower Man VS Extinct Plant: http://youtu.be/YzQJuPZj6tE\nInstant Water: http://youtu.be/qjm5pOu_PEw\n\nGags are filmed in Qu\u00e9bec.

This matters because diabetes in pregnancy has an adverse effect on the mother's health, and also has the potential to influence the health of the unborn child throughout its life.\n \nOur researchers are assessing whether a nutritional intervention and a probiotic capsule, either together or separately, can help prevent gestational diabetes in obese women at highest risk. If this research is successful, we have potential to improve health of mothers and babies and potentially reduce the cycle of childhood obesity.

There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas (Washington), but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters, however, street-savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.\n\n\"american gangster\",\"american gangster clip\",\"american gangster trailer\",\"american gangster part 1\",\"american gangster soundtrack\",\"roger bart\",\"20th century period pieces\",\"biographical dramas\",\"crime dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",\"brian grazer\",\"ridley scott\",\"branko lustig\",\"james whitaker\",\"jonathan filley\",\"michael costigan\",\"sarah bowen\",\"steven zaillian\",\"nicholas pileggi\",\"race videos\",\"us attorney\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++358717,/m/01wb8bs", "title": "American Gangster (6/11) Movie CLIP - Above the Mafia (2007) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-28T00:55:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-qmrehOGDOk", "description": "\"What's New?\" written by Martin Other - Gonzalo Other and performed by THE OTHERNESS.

Posle samo godinu dana FORTY izbacuje pesmu \"CRVENO PLAVO BELO\" ne slute\u0107i kakvu \u0107e reakciju prouzrokovati ta pesma, naglo dobija do tada njemu ne poznat publicitet koji mu je dao podsticaj da nastavi dalje. Nakon nekoliko snimljenih pesama FORTY odlazi u TV show \"JA IMAM TALENAT\" sa svojih ne punih 18 godina, gde uspeva da se plasira u polufinale u 40 najboljih. Izlaskom iz tog show-a, de\u0161ava se veliki obrt u njegovom \u017eivotu u vidu nastupa, koncerata, gostovaja na festivalima i televizijama. Kada se cela pri\u010da malo sti\u0161ala FORTY  odlu\u010duje da krene sa radom na prvom albumu. U medjuvremenu u isti TV show prijavljuje se njegov jako dobar prijatelj i saradnik Mihajlo Vlahovic Beli koji ga poziva da uz njega nastupa kao back vokal. Ne o\u010dekivano, jako dobrim nastupima u toj emisiji otvorio se put do samog finala u kome je zauzeto osmo mesto. Od tog trenutka uve\u0107ao se sam broj nastupa, ali mo\u017eda najbitniji od svih su bili nastupi na EXIT-u i BEER FEST-u. \n\nPored mnogobrojnih nastupa u Beogradu i van njega FORTY  uspeva da zavr\u0161i album sa svojih 19 godina pod nazivom \"REP PATRIOTIZAM\" u Flame Audio Studiu. Od muzi\u010dkih saradnika na albumu tu su: Beli, BMC, DT Crew, Makica i Coje. \u0160to se ti\u010de Dizajna najve\u0107i doprinos pru\u017eio je Milanko Savovi\u0107 Mixa Digital. Beat maker: Denjah Beatz, a sam album je izdat za: SL RECORDS.\n\nNajve\u0107e zasluge pripale su novom hip hop pokretu koji je u svakom aspektu dao svoj maksimum: HIPHOPLIFE.rs\n\nNa albumu se nalaze 11 pesama: Suva realnost, Rep patriotizam, Beograde, Beli orao, Neko i ne\u0161to, Borba za ljubav, Srbija u boji, Rehabilitacija, Tek je po\u010delo, MML i Crveno plavo belo.

(Jan.2006)\nShocking  and Unbelievable. Big reptiles in public park.\n\n\nGuayaquil - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil\n\nEcuador - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador\n\nIguania - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguania\n\nLizards - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizards\n\nMap - http://tinyurl.com/3xu8jsb\n\nMade with Sony DSC-V1\u2028\u2028\n\nPhotos on \u202ahttp://www.jurajmitas.com\n\n\nLIZARDS - are a very large and widespread group of squamate reptiles, with nearly 3800 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales), which are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the anguimorph lizards from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.\nLizards typically have limbs and external ears, while snakes lack both these characteristics. However, because they are defined negatively as excluding snakes, lizards have no unique distinguishing characteristic as a group. Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the sphenodonts, which have a more primitive and solid diapsid skull. Many lizards can detach their tails to escape from predators, an act called autotomy, but this trait is not shared by all lizards. Vision, including color vision, is particularly well developed in most lizards, and most communicate with body language or bright colors on their bodies as well as with pheromones. The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimetres for some chameleons and geckos to nearly three metres (9 feet, 6 inches) in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo Dragon. Some extinct varanids reached great size. The extinct aquatic mosasaurs reached 17 metres, and the giant monitor Megalania prisca is estimated to have reached perhaps seven metres.\n\n\nGUAYAQUIL - officially Santiago de Guayaquil, is the largest and the most populous city in Ecuador, with a metro area population exceeding 3.3 million[citation needed] at the end of 2009, as well as that nation's main port. The city is the capital of the Ecuadorian province of Guayas and the seat of the namesake canton.\nGuayaquil is located on the western bank of the Guayas River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Guayaquil. Because of its location, the city is the center of Ecuador's business and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nECUADOR - (pronounced /\u02c8\u025bkw\u0259d\u0254r/ , officially the Republic of Ecuador (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador; pronounced [re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0el ekwa\u02c8\u00f0or], which literally translates to the Republic of the Equator) is a representative democratic republic in South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and by the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is one of only two countries in South America, along with Chile, that do not have a border with Brazil. The country also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) west of the mainland.", "title": "Big reptiles in public park 4 - Guayaquil  (Ecuador)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T08:55:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-qymgfeatcg", "description": "www.kabbalah.info/hung \n\n\u201eA kabbala felt\u00e1r\u00e1sa\" c\u00edmmel tanfolyamot tartunk.

Remote jammers, which prevent a car from being locked by the driver's remote, enable thieves to get into a vehicle and make off with valuables in less than 20 seconds. The advantage to the thief is that this can be done from a distance without the driver realising it, as their remote will still appear to be active. There are usually two or three people involved, often using cellphones to communicate. This crime is on the rise, with the South African Insurance Association (SAIA) saying that it is now the second most common way of stealing from a car. Household remote-control devices which currently use the same radio frequency as cars, like those used for gates and garage doors, are used to block the signal of most motor vehicle remote-control devices. There are also \"professional\" jamming devices. \n\nStandard insurance policies exclude any loss from a vehicle without violent and forcible entry, and in the case of jamming the doors are simply opened in the normal manner. The Ombudsman has ruled against jamming claims in favour of the insurers as there has been no way of presuming jamming has occurred. However, with immediate effect, Safire will consider video surveillance evidence which could verify the fact that the insured has taken all reasonable steps in securing the vehicle and its contents, as satisfying the forcible and violent entry requirements of the policy. This type of footage has enabled us to actually see thieves in action and surveillance footage could possibly assist with arrests.", "title": "Safire Insurance remote jamming", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07T10:42:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-r1lJuk4EjA", "description": "A luckless police detective becomes the target of blackmail after trying to cover up a hit-and-run, in this wild South Korean neo-noir thriller.", "title": "A HARD DAY Trailer | Festival 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T14:10:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-r25syLhlI0", "description": "Ragged And Dirty by Willie Brown\n\nRecorded with Apogee Duet and a pair of Oktava Mc012 mics", "title": "Ragged And Dirty", "publishedDate": "2013-06-27T20:44:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-r2BtwsNrnY", "description": "", "title": "\u0418\u043d\u043d\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446.

On Serotonin, we witness Oby Nine, Jarreau Vandal, Umoja, Moiety, Moods and Esteble all flexing their production chops. Each producer offers his own interpretation of Serotonin, by way of structural and melodic re-arrangements. Radiating from the eclectic re-interpretations, Serotonin Remix EP takes on the air of cohesive divergence. The EP's overall sound is solid and consistent, whilst sounds of individual tracks are deviations from one another. The heterogeneous styles of contributing producers induce a sense of musical adventure. A sensory trip, where the listener hears, feels and envisages familiar sensory patterns albeit each pattern being quiet unfamiliar. As Oby Nine puts it \"my idea for this EP is to create something that can help release serotonin in the brain of listeners\", that's exactly what this EP has achieved. \n\nOby's remix EP charts through UK garage, house, Brazilian bossa, groovy bass and crispy beats. The elusive novelty realized by Serotonin Remix EP is its holistic sound. The manner by which it moulds various distinctive sounds into one \"feel good\" expedition. An expedition of the mind as variations of serotonin is released into the brain. \n\nSerotonin Remix EP is INI Movement's 15th release out on all major online music platforms as of 20th January 2014.\n\nreleased 20 January 2014 \nMastered By: J.

I'm referring to Sonic Adventure 2). Well, Super Sonic in this case. We need to stop Gemerl, and Eggman just wants to take revenge of Gemerl for attacking him.\n\nYou just have to use Tag Action to send Eggman towards Gemerl's eye to open it and then bash it. The more you charge the attack, the longer the eye will be open (the maximum you can charge the attack is when Eggman's flash turns orange). However, while you use Tag Action, you cannot dash so the tricky part of the battle is that you will have problems dodging his attacks if you're charging yours. The attacks will make you go back and will stop your Tag Action if you were charging it. Keep an eye on the Ring gauge and be sure to grab some while you charge the attack. Other than that, this boss do not present much trouble.\n\nTomorrow is my first day in the university... this video kinda represents the end of the summer, as well as how I'm prepared to afford the challenges that will wait for me out there. I won't be able to upload too regularly (well, more or less it will be pretty much the same rate I have kept this whole time) but I will try to take one Final Boss to you per week. Still, I should be careful, I will run short of videos some day and I won't be able upload more...", "title": "Sonic Advance 3 - Final Boss: Nonaggression", "publishedDate": "2011-09-25T12:36:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rHtbkEsM9s", "description": "", "title": "LAYIA - DEYTERA TIS LAMPRIS 2012 - 8", "publishedDate": "2012-04-18T12:32:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rIG4YnXq3c", "description": "Fruits Basket (Japanese: \u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8 Hepburn: Fur\u016btsu Basuketto), sometimes abbreviated Furuba, or Fruba (\u30d5\u30eb\u30d0), is a Japanese sh\u014djo manga series written and illustrated by Natsuki Takaya. It was serialized in the semi-monthly Japanese magazine Hana to Yume, published by Hakusensha, from 1998 to 2006. The series was also adapted into a 26-episode anime series, directed by Akitaro Daichi. The series tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that twelve members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac (\u5341\u4e8c\u652f J\u016bnishi?) and are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak, stressed, or when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite sex that is not possessed by a zodiacal spirit. In the anime it is possible to transform through torso contact.\n\nThe word \"Fruits\" in the title is always plural; the spelling originates from the transcription of the English word \"fruit\" into Japanese, where because there is no \"tu\" sound, \"tsu\" is used instead. The title comes from the name of a popular game played in Japanese elementary schools, which is alluded to in the series.\n\nWhen high school student Tohru Honda's mother dies in a car crash on her way to work, she decides to live with her grandfather. Renovations on the house cause her to move out of her grandfather's house temporarily, and since she has nowhere else to go, Tohru begins living in a tent and supporting herself. That is, until she finds a home in the least likely of places, inhabited by her popular classmate Yuki Sohma and his cousins Shigure and Kyo. The Sohmas however, live with a curse. Twelve (not including Kyo, who is the cat) members of the family are possessed by spirits of the Chinese zodiac and turn into their zodiac animal when they are weak, under stress, or when hugged by someone of the opposite gender.\n\nWhen Tohru discovers the Sohmas' secret, she promises not to tell and is allowed to keep living with them. Although the Sohmas' curse is deeper and darker than Tohru realized, her presence and her acceptance of them soon becomes a large, positive influence on those possessed by the zodiac. She sets out to break the curse, and on the way, meets and discovers each of the Sohma's vengeful zodiac spirits. Each has a different personality, just like the animals in the Chinese zodiac. Tohru's existence changes the Sohma clan's lives forever.\n\nDirected by Akitaro Daichi, the twenty-six episode Fruits Basket anime series was animated and produced by Studio DEEN. It premiered on TV Tokyo on July 5, 2001, with the final episode airing on December 27, 2001. The series aired in France on France 4, in Spain on Buzz Channel, and in Vietnam on HTV3. FUNimation aired the series, in dubbed English, on their anime television channel as well as on Colours TV.\n\nThe series was released in Japan in nine individual DVD volumes by King Records, with each volume containing three episodes except for the first volume, which contained two. The first volume was released on September 29, 2001, with subsequent volumes released on a monthly basis until the final volume was released on May 22, 2002. A series box set was released on April 25, 2007, containing all twenty-six episodes, as well a message card from Natsuki Takaya, a 60-page deluxe booklet, and a bonus Fruits Basket CD soundtrack.\n\nThe series is licensed for Region 1 DVD release by FUNimation Entertainment, which released it in the form of four individual volumes containing 6-7 episodes and a complete series box set. On November 20, 2007, FUNimation re-released the series as part of their lower priced Viridian line, with the new release containing the complete series in a thin-packed box set. In the United Kingdom, FUNimation originally distributed the series through MVM Entertainment, but then changed distributors in November 2006 to Revelation Films. Revelation re-released the four individual volumes under their label. They also released the series box set on January 22, 2007. In Region 4, the series was released as a complete series box set by Madman Entertainment on October 15, 2003.\n\nThe 136 chapters of Fruits Basket were originally serialized in Japan by Hakusensha in Hana to Yume from July 1998 to November 2006. These were collected in 23 tank\u014dbon volumes, with the final volume published in Japan on March 19, 2007.", "title": "Fruits Basket Full Ending OST Soundtrack \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7948\u308a instrumental", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T15:03:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rJSGRQAniU", "description": "x", "title": "Descendents - Hope - Live", "publishedDate": "2008-03-11T13:51:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rKlGCJGXcA", "description": "http://www.trom.no Lars Kolstad demonstrating how to make simple drum\nmallets", "title": "Make your own beaters", "publishedDate": "2010-10-23T19:35:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rL5RcaxBIg", "description": "Thanks to Collision_Tn for pitching this idea.  \n\nFilming crew:\ntldr_baz\nMk2n\nColission_Tn\n\n===Best game prices on the web===\nhttps://www.g2a.com/r/recfilming\n\n=== Visit us at https://www.recfilming.com/ ===\n\n===Join a great site for content producers===\nhttp://gamerclips.tv/?mref=RECFilming\n\n===Partnership with Maker network===\nhttp://awe.sm/bGpfl \n\n===Join our filming crew===\nPlatoon #1\nhttp://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/platoons/view/8034927859841145827/\n\n===Plus Us===\ngoogle.com/+RECfilming\n\n===Follow us on Facebook===\n/REC-filming-platoon\n\n===Follow us on Twitter=== \nhttps://twitter.com/RECfilming", "title": "Looking for Phantom Dog Tags | Battlefield Phantom Program in Final Stand |", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T21:46:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rLMB25aiCc", "description": "Como ya saben, M\u00e9xico es un lugar en donde abundan las ladies, que si la Lady Chiles, Lady Profeco, Lady Polanco, etc\u00e9tera.\n\nEsta vez justo en el mes contra el c\u00e1ncer de mama, le toc\u00f3 la oportunidad de lucirse a una Lady con mucha pechonalidad, que despu\u00e9s de ser rozada tres veces en sus atributos, no pudo controlar su furia y se convirti\u00f3 en la #LadyBubis\n\nPero nosotros creemos que m\u00e1s que una lady es una cortesana\u2026 \u00bfUna Lady en el metro? \u00a1JA!

To achieve this, we designed and added in all pages illustrative drawings and flowcharts. Also, we used simple language and vocabulary in the presentation of the contents of this book. In addition, we designed and used page margins for the interpretation of some ambiguous terminology and general information related to cultural and historical events linked to the book themes.\n\nIn this book we will address tracks of historical philosophy and the evolution of the meaning of philosophy and most known models that accounted for ancient Eastern civilizations in different periods of time. Also, we will present the Ancient Greek Mythology which preceded the philosophy and the most important ideas of Greek philosophers since its inception by Thales until closing Greek philosophical schools in 529 A.D.\n\nWe hope that this effort will contribute to enriching the mind with the \"love of wisdom\" (philosophy), and achieving the desired objectives.\n\n\nSafa'a Ali Alqabandi\nKuwait -- 08/19/2012", "title": "Biography of Philosophy - Safa`a Alqabandi", "publishedDate": "2012-12-14T18:06:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rQ8-bFoMpk", "description": "", "title": "Concert 20 mai Aesthesia+Adam Bomb 012", "publishedDate": "2009-05-21T15:09:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rQDDc7Pxlc", "description": "Star Citizen ist sooooo geil: http://on.pcgh.de/1h7lSSH\n\nZu Star Citizen wurde ein neuer Trailer ver\u00f6ffentlicht, in dem wir die Anvil Aerospace Hornet F7C in einem sehr ansehnlichen Weltraumkampf beobachten d\u00fcrfen.

It is one of the masterpieces of Mamluk architecture. The building was commissioned by the ninth Burji Mamluk Sultan [al-Nasir Badr-ad-Din Abu al-Ma'aly] al-Hassan bin Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Qalawun in 1356 AD as a mosque and religious school for all four juristic branches of Sunni Islam. It was designed so that each of the four schools of thought (Shafi, Maliki, Hanafi and Hanbali) has its own area while sharing the Mosque for prayer purposes.\n\nConstruction started in 1356 AD and ended 7 years later in 1363 AD. Building materials used were harvested from the casing stones of the Giza Necropolis. One of the minarets collapsed during construction killing 300 people. The state was able to fund the massive structure through the properties that were left behind by the victims of the Black Death. The Sultan was assassinated before the mosque was completed and his body was never recovered. The magnificent burial chamber that was intended for him holds his two sons instead.\n\nThe facade is 76 meters long and 36 meters high. The cornices, the entrance portal, the burial chamber, and the monumental staircase are particularly noteworthy. Verses from the Quran in elegant Kufic and Thuluth scripts adorn the inner walls.\n\nThe mosque is featured on the Egyptian one-hundred pound note.", "title": "Salat el-Taraweeh at the Sultan Hassan Madrasa-Mosque", "publishedDate": "2009-09-04T04:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rQciRpkPDY", "description": "Check out our instructional video on how to do a barrel turn.", "title": "Barrel Turn", "publishedDate": "2010-04-13T12:43:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rQmbUIbXh8", "description": "Software used-Metasequoia\nSongs in credit\nSubscribe and commet\nMade by my brother not me", "title": "Metasequoia Anime + models", "publishedDate": "2009-08-07T06:36:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rR8qC9gaVo", "description": "In the dusty streets of Kabul, Afghanistan, 8-year-old Farouk works tirelessly peddling calendars and newspapers.

These flowering beauties are one of the most underutilized and unknown bulb flowers. Like most bulbs, alliums are planted in the fall. However, unlike tulips or daisies, these garden flowers won't bloom until early summer, as opposed to in the spring. Alliums can range in size from petite varieties to larger, showy varieties like Allium giganteum and Globemaster. Within your garden, plant alliums in areas with part to full sunshine and good drainage. Let the foilage die down on its own before trimming off any dead areas. These purple flowers will naturalize easily and come back the next year bigger and even more beautiful. Try not to deadhead alliums, as the flower head will stand erect long after the color is gone, adding another layer of dimension to gardens. These bulb flowers are also great in a vase, lasting up to two weeks, forming seed pods before they begin to fade. Add a little excitement to your garden by spraypainting allium seedheads and using them as garden ornaments, placing them strategically around other flowers. The allium plant is just one of many garden ideas that can give your garden a unique edge in your neighborhood!\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.bhg.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mybhg\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/bhg\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/bhg/\nGooglePlus: https://plus.google.com/114700401799581477045/posts\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/betterhomesandgardens#", "title": "Gardening with Alliums", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T13:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rUer7XC0JQ", "description": "Curious wild samango monkey grabs a bushbuck by the ear", "title": "Monkey grabs bushbuck", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T16:24:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rUmu1wUgjc", "description": "Danzig and Doyle Live at Rockfest 2014 june 21st", "title": "04   Danzig and Doyle   Skulls Live @ Rockfest 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T13:49:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rVI8Mqd0ro", "description": "Two out of three heart attack survivors do not make the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent a repeat heart attack.

EXIT was never just a movement and never just a festival - it was both, intertwined. \n\nThis is who we are. \nAnd we believe in the spark. \nDo you?\n\nFollow EXIT Festival:\nhttp://www.exitfest.org\nhttp://www.exitmusic.rs\nhttp://www.exitfest.tv \nhttp://www.facebook.com/exitfestival\nhttp://www.twitter.com/exitfestival\nhttp://www.youtube.com/exitfestival \nhttp://www.google.com/+exitfestival\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/exitfestival\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/exitfestival \nhttp://www.myspace.com/exitfestival\nhttp://www.last.fm/user/exitfestival\nhttp://www.flickr.com/exitfestival \nhttp://www.instagram.com/exitfestival\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/exitfestival", "title": "THE PRODIGY - POISON LIVE AT EXIT R:Evolution 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T16:57:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rrN-KUpWW4", "description": "El Canalla gan\u00f3 por 5-4 en la definici\u00f3n, luego de un 0-0 en los 90 reglamentarios, en el estadio San Juan del Bicentenario, por los Cuartos de la Copa Argentina Sancor Seguros.", "title": "Penales y festejos de River - Rosario Central", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T05:43:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-rrgWzDnYEE", "description": "http://www.endoruddle.com/jit/detail/187/Rationale+for+Treatment+2?cat=52\nIn this show, the importance of diagnosis, access, glide path management, shaping canals, 3D cleaning and filling root canal systems, and how these procedures will be performed in some anatomically interesting maxillary teeth, will be emphasized.

Nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, the White family lives an existence more like something from the Wild West than modern-day suburbified America.

Vitiligo characterized by the appearance of white patches on different parts of the body like the arms, armpits, legs, face, navel and genital regions. These white patches occur because the pigment-producing cells, called melanocytes, are destroyed or stop functioning. \n\nMost doctors believe that it is a result of an autoimmune reaction, meaning the body's defense system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells, resulting in their destruction. Some researchers say that severe sunburn and emotional stress can trigger vitiligo. Vitiligo affects all races and both genders equally, but you are more likely to suffer from this condition if a parent has it. You may also have a predisposition to it if autoimmune diseases run in your family. Vitiligo can cause a great deal of emotional stress and can lead to poor self-image and low self-esteem. However, it is not harmful to the overall health and is not contagious in any way. \n\nThere are a number of treatment options for vitiligo. The first line of therapy tends include steroids,  either as oral drugs or creams. \nOne effective option is the use of UV light in combination with psoralen drugs or creams. \n\nAnother form of surgical treatment is skin grafting, which involves taking some healthy skin from one body part and attaching it instead of affected skin on another body part. \nVitiligo can be also cured naturally, using a combination of natural extracts, vitamins, and lifestyle changes. Several published research papers have documented a complete cure from vitiligo in as quickly as three weeks using this method. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sLrFsD2C5M", "title": "Vitiligo Treatment (in-depth look at Vitiligo)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T23:56:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sM-8ZRx7_0", "description": "Sabrina Carpenter is just a dream!\n\nNot only did she recently give us a sneak peek at her her music video for Middle of Starting Over (click HERE to see it!), but she's also gifted us this totally fun and EXCLUSIVE acoustic performance of Can't Blame A Girl For Trying!\n\nIt's off her debut EP of the same title, and it's one of those songs you'll be belting out in your car.\n\nThe Girl Meets World star's rich voice is perfect for the catchy love song that takes you right back to your younger days!\n\nAnd if this still isn't enough to fulfill your Sabrina Carpenter needs, stay tuned for ANOTHER acoustic coming soon!\n\n\nRead more: http://perezhilton.com/2014-09-15-exclusive-sabrina-carpenter-acoustic-cant-blame-a-girl-for-trying#ixzz3DPoc4P1g", "title": "Sabrina Carpenter - \"Can't Blame A Girl For Trying\" (Exclusive Perez Hilton Acoustic)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T19:45:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sMHooy8zNA", "description": "Joan Norton, VMD, DACVIM introduces her topic by reviewing the effect of a hyperplastic pituitary gland on the secretion of ACTH, resulting in excessive cortisol production by the adrenal gland.

Surfactants are usually organic compounds, which are \u201cAmphiphilic\u201d. Amphiphilic means that they have a water attracting side (hydrophilic head) and a water repellent side (hydrophobic tail). As a reason, surfactants contain, a water insoluble component and a water soluble component. In case of a mixture with oil, surfactant will diffuse in water and adsorb at interface right between the air and water. This phenomenon helps in the formation of a \u201cmicelle\u201d. A micelle has heads in contact with the solvent i.e. usually water and tails which are inside the sphere are lipophilic, these tails lock oil and interact with it.\n\nSurfactants may also work by lowering the surface tension of water. Surface tension which has the unit energy per unit surface area (J/m\u00b2) or force per unit length (N/m) is the force with which the liquid opposes any increment in its surface area. Surface tension in water is due to \u201cHydrogen bonding\u201d. The water molecules are tightly clinging onto one another. When a surfactant is added to the water, surfactant will work up the water and air interface. That is due to the fact that the attractive forces between solute molecules and water is far less than the attraction between water molecules. This causes the water molecules to spread out and as a result surface tension is reduced.\n\nThere are 4 types of Surfactants:\n\u2022 Anionic\n\u2022 Cationic\n\u2022 Non-Ionic \n\u2022 Zwitter-ionic\n\nFirst Experiment:-\nIn the first experiment, when the paper clip is carefully placed on water, it floats on the surface of water even though it has a higher density than the water. This is due to the pressure being applied by the paper clip is higher than the surface tension of the water. After that, a dilute solution of surfactant is added to the water which interrupts membrane-like arrangement of the water molecules. This surfactant decreases the surface tension of the water and causes the paper clip to sink.\n\nSecond experiment:-\nIn the second experiment, a dry cloth was used to simulate dry soil conditions as it was not readily available. When water is added, a water droplet is formed on the surface of the dry cloth for a short period of time. However, when a dilute solution of surfactant is introduced to the surface of the dry cloth, it gets absorbed much quicker than that of the water.  Soil water repellency is caused over a long time. The soil particles consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends. When the soil dehydrates, it changes its form so that the hydrophobic ends are exposed to the atmosphere thus making that part of the soil water repellent.\n\nUses of Surfactants:-\n1) As Emulsifiers in oil industry: - Oil industries use drilling mud to assist in the drilling process for oil. Drilling mud contains a base fluid which is usually made of oil but can also be diluted with water using emulsifiers to lower costs.\n2) Cleaning agent: - The hydrophobic region of the surfactant binds with the oil particles on a surface and separates it from the surface.", "title": "Why do surfactants make water adsorbable in dry soil?", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T03:08:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sOsDqwUL74", "description": "SHADY LURK PATROL\ncombating shadiness with shady tactics\nkeepin nasties incheck\n\nSLP definition @ http://inanedefinitions.com/d/slp", "title": "SLP meaning and pronunciation", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T07:39:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sP--xjrgFE", "description": "http://www.facebook.com/johnnystanwyck\nhttp://grindhouseschoolhouse.blogspot.com/\n\nA weird and wild film!

The study is part of an effort to develop brain-controlled devices for severely paralyzed patients.  Spinal cord injuries have affected millions of people worldwide.  They are unable to use or move one or more parts of the body.  The study is the work of researchers at the Duke University Center for Neuroengineering in North Carolina.  The researchers have developed what they call a brain-machine interface. It connects the brain of the monkey to a machine.  They hope it could someday be used to let someone with a spinal cord injury control an artificial arm or leg, just by thinking about it.  Early versions of the software could control only one artificial limb.  But a newer version lets rhesus monkeys move two arms at the same time as they watch a likeness of themselves on a computer screen.  Miguel Nicolelis is a neurobiology professor at Duke.  He says the monkeys first learned to control the limbs on the computer screens using joysticks.  Then the animals were trained not to move.  Professor Nicolelis says scientists are now developing a brain-controlled neuroprosthetic vest. Anyone wearing the vest would be able to move a mechanical arm or leg. The device takes electrical signals from the brain and makes them into motor commands.  These messages are then made into digital signals that a machine in the vest can understand.  Professor Nicolelis plans to show the device at the 2014 World Cup later this year.  A report on the study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.", "title": "Anh ng\u1eef \u0111\u1eb7c bi\u1ec7t: Virtual Prosthetics (VOA-Tech Rep)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T23:57:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sWZxXWTQNc", "description": "individui di rara Moretta tabaccata sorpresi dalla LIPU presso le zone umide della Capitanata.\nLa Moretta tabaccata (Aythya nyroca) \u00e8 un'anatra tuffatrice abbastanza rara.

In 1963, \"Baby\" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a 17-year-old spending the summer with her family at a resort hotel in the Catskills; she plans on being in the Peace Corps next summer, so this is expected to be her last summer as a carefree adolescent. Baby doesn't get along with her older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker), and she's bored to tears by most of the older guests at the resort. However, one night Baby hears what sounds like a party going on in the employee's dormitory, and she pokes her head in to discover most of the hotel staff enjoying the sort of close dancing that would get you kicked out of the senior prom in no time flat. Baby is particularly struck by handsome Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a dancer in the resort's floor show, and falls head over heels in love, wanting to be near him. When Johnny's dance partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), finds herself pregnant after a fling with one of the waiters, Baby volunteers to learn her steps and take her place; however, Baby's father, Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach), will have none of it, convinced that Johnny is a low life and that his daughter is too young to understand her own feelings. Dirty Dancing was a surprise box-office hit, and the soundtrack album was an even bigger success, spawning several hit singles and inspiring a top-drawing concert tour featuring several of its artists.\n\n\"dirty dancing\",\"dirty dancing clip\",\"dirty dancing hungry eyes\",\"dirty dancing havana nights\",\"patrick swayze\",\"jennifer grey\",\"cynthia rhodes\",\"emile ardolino\",\"mirror videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",dance,\"period pieces\",romance,\"steven reuther\",\"mitchell cannold\",\"doro bachrach\",\"eleanor bergstein\",\"linda gottlieb\",\"attraction videos\",\"dedication videos\",\"love videos\",\"mistakes videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++13874,/m/032cfy,/m/02h3tp,/m/06kfr8", "title": "Hungry Eyes - Dirty Dancing (2/12) Movie CLIP (1987) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T02:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-sYXGIJpULw", "description": "Click Here To Subscribe For Glitches\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/user/jamiexelitev2?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMade By - https://www.youtube.com/user/ohRyanHD \n\nFollow Me On Instagram FOR 10TH! http://instagram.com/jamiexelitev\n\nOur FaceBook FanPage\nhttp://www.facebook.com/JAMIExxELITE\n\nFacebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/jami3xelite\n\nBecome a Fan on Twitter \nhttps://twitter.com/JAMIExELITEv2\n\nSnapChat - Username - JAMIExELITEv\n\n-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=--=-=-==-=-=-==-=-\n\nPlease sign up to TheNextGamer.com for Partnership\nhttp://thenextgamer.com/\n\n\u25baJAMIExELITE\u25c4\n\nCall Of Duty: Advanced Warfare! 10th Prestige / Glitches & Mods! 15th Prestige - Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare!

Back then it was empty hours and the off-frame and the shoot of a triple X film. Now, it's the everyday life of a Spanish speaking dominatrix who lives somewhere in downtown Buenos Aires. The camera hardly ever leaves her apartment which works as both a home and a dungeon --with all the elements of her leather-metal cult-- and an anteroom from which she herself coordinates her dates. The phone is essential: through it we get to her contact with clients, her family, absent boyfriend with whom she talks about the details of their upcoming marriage.

A standard house insurance policy may not be the best option for owners who rent out their properties. If you are letting out your property for commercial purposes then the risks associated are higher and a simple house insurance policy may turn out to be ineffective. It is advisable to go for landlord property insurance in the UK, which is designed for the purposes of landlords renting out properties.\n\nLandlord property insurance is generally purchased to protect your property and investment, especially when the property is used by someone other than the owner. Even if your personal property is your main abode but you plan to rent it out for short periods, a landlord property insurance policy comes into play. According to the expert insurance agents, the landlord is entirely responsible for making sure that a suitable insurance policy is in place. Therefore, it becomes an underlying necessity to have landlord property insurance in the UK.\n\nPeople tend to confuse landlord property insurance with homeowners insurance. Both may sound similar but play different roles. Normal homeowners insurance does not cover all your contents and property. For this reason you have to buy additional coverage. Buying landlord property insurance in the UK gets everything in place. If you have recently purchased landlord property insurance in the UK, then it will cover the following contents:\n\nSewer Back To Article Index up\nWater Damage\nHome computer software\nEquipment and supplies for an at-home business\nSecurities, money, or bullion\nWatercraft and equipment\nSpare automobile parts\nMotorised wheelchairs and power scooters\nJewellery and furs\nBicycles\n\nWhen you have several landlord property insurance quotes in hand, it becomes difficult to decide which company to select. In such circumstances, try to look for the details of the insurance claim procedure and its past records.

I believe that this is among the most powerful documentary series that will wake up both the Black and Latino communities in America against liberal and big government socialist policy agenda in America. It exposes the RACISM primarily found in the Democrat Party and the tolerance of racist liberal policy within left-leaning and democrat-leaning organizations (as well as Big Government Republicans).

The Political Parties NEVER Switched in their views - http://youtu.be/I3LqPedoxSk\n\nLearn how the political demand for more birth control is really code for making the abortion of Blacks, Latinos, and other minority groups easier, more available, tax payer funded, and more frequent.  These politicians behave as rappers who are paid BIG BUCKS to sellout Black young people as musical Pied Pippers with lyrics all about committing violence in order to create and glorify the culture of the very lifestyle and attitudes that are introducing them to a life of drugs, crime, and perpetuating the condition of fatherless homes - as if it should be normal.

How many times have we heard democrats cry out for more birth control. In reality the call for more Birth Control is really a call for more Black and Latino Genocide. For example, the fabricated, premeditated liberal media stun using Sandra Fluke (ie.
