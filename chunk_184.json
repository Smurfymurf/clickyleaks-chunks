It is our task to conduct these dialogues in the city and to bring together a diverse group of citizens representing public, private, civic, industry, non-profits, local philanthropies, workers, street vendors, urban poor groups, academe, women and youth who will consider scenarios for the future of Accra in 2040.\n\nCommunity focal persons have been enrolled to help us reach people from three excluded communities;Ga Mashie and Fadama (also known as Sodom and Gomorrah - the largest slum settlement in Accra), and Nima which is a predominantly muslim community also referred to as \"zongos\", whose inhabitants are often migrants from the regions, working in informal sectors and traditionally seen as an excluded minority.\n\nAn important legacy that we want to leave in excluded communities from this project, is the opportunity for people to imagine a better future for themselves and for their city. In order to share the ideas of this process more effectively, we are launching a short YouTube video competition called Accra Future-Now Video Competition.\n\n78 volunteers took part in 3-minute video recording, to answer three short questions on film:\na. What are your hopes and fears for the future of your community?\nb. What would you like to change about where you live?\nc. How will things improve when that change comes?\n\nThe project team will select 10 finalists whose videos will be compiled into a short DVD, these recordings will be placed on the ICD ACCRA YouTube website for broadcast during April.\n\nThe top three winners will receive cash prizes and support, to encourage them in community advocacy. Names will be announced in April and winners invited to attend a presentation dinner Tuesday April 23rd 2013 in Accra.", "title": "Samuel Tagoe of Ga Mashie speaks to the ICD Accra team", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T20:33:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AayWXDlHhDs", "description": "A UP GP15-1 heading east\n\nUP Clinton/Geneva Subdivision\nFilmed 9/5/10\n(c) Railroad Capitol Productions", "title": "Baby Tunnel Motor Running Light, Clinton, IA", "publishedDate": "2010-09-11T14:29:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AayYneSTGI0", "description": "Acredito ser uma larva de aqu\u00e1tica de Inseto da ordem Megaloptera.

His fourth artist album, 'Mirage', contains two years of hard work and creativity, coming together in 16 tracks. Collaborations with Christian Burns, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Ferry Corsten, Adam Young, BT, Guy Chambers and many other gifted artists, as well as several stunning solo-instrumentals, was the musical journey that Armin completed. \n\nThat journey now leads to a new destination: 'Mirage - The Remixes'. The album that received 2 golden records and was praised for its musical fusions and surprises, was remixed by some of today's biggest producer talents. All with their own strengths, point of view, style and source of inspiration, they've delivered a new interpretation of one of its 16 jewels. 'Mirage' has been held in front of the mirror, and now sees its audio reflections revealing brand new sounds on 'Mirage - The Remixes'.\n\nRemixes by Avicii, BT, Dash Berlin, Jerome Isma-Ae, 16 Bit Lolita's, Tocadisco, Kyau & Albert, W&W, Ummet Ozcan, Ralphie B, Arctic Moon and many other talented producers have put 'Mirage' into a bright, new light. 'Mirage - The Remixes' is there for everyone who wants to explore the other side and character of the album. Whether you love uplifting trance, steamy hot house or deep-rolling progressive, 'Mirage - The Remixes' indulges you with a new fa\u00e7ade to every track you already loved.\n\nhttp://itunes.com/armadamusic \nhttp://armadamusicradio.com \nhttps://soundcloud.com/armadamusic", "title": "Armin van Buuren feat.

This is the first time,\" the new Olympic figure skating champion Kim Yu-Na told reporters after stepping off the rink. But everyone present at Vancouver's Pacific Coliseum Arena understood why, after witnessing one of the greatest performances and most inspirational evenings in Olympic Winter Games history.\n\nThe 19-year-old Korean, dancing to Gershwin's Concerto in G, delivered a mesmerising show of elegance and athleticism. She landed an opening triple lutz-triple toe combination, followed by a perfect triple flip and double axel-double toe-double loop, but just as dazzling as her huge jumps were the breathtaking grace, precision and artistry of the performance. \n\nIt earned her a colossal 150.06 points in her free programme, for a world record score of 228.56. Kim's artistry was so exceptional that Japan's Mao Asada was more than 23 points behind in second despite landing two triple Axels.\n\n\"She didn't miss a step,\" said Kim's Canadian coach Brian Orser, himself a former Olympic medallist. \"She was skating with her heart. I just wanted her to have an Olympic moment. I wanted it to be Olympic and not cautious, not hold back, just go out and embrace the space, and the Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe bronze medal was won by Canada's Joannie Rochette, who, following her courageous skate in the short programme, had the strength to turn in another remarkable performance just four days after the death of her mother, earning standing ovations from the crowd both before and after her skate. After she had finished, the 24-year-old from Quebec put her hands together and blew a kiss towards the skies.\n\n\"I feel proud and the result did not matter. It was a lifetime project for me and my mom, and we achieved that,\" she said, adding: \"She was always proud of me. She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way.\"\n\nSmall wonder that on such an emotionally-charged night, the once-impassive Kim should be moved to tears.\n\n\"Three times,\" answered Kim, asked how many times she had cried since winning the gold. \"After my performance was over and then on the podium. [Joannie Rochette] started crying, and I started crying right with her.\"\n\nFind out more about Yuna Kim: http://www.olympic.org/yuna-kim", "title": "Yuna Kim's Incredible Figure Skating Performance - Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics", "publishedDate": "2013-04-08T10:00:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbBh_TIxjW0", "description": "La arquitectura rom\u00e1nica es el resultado de la integraci\u00f3n de f\u00f3rmulas constructivas y est\u00e9ticas de diversa procedencia: romana, prerrom\u00e1nica, bizantina, germ\u00e1nica y \u00e1rabe, hasta alcanzar una unidad de criterios y una personalidad considerables.\n\nPero no se puede considerar al arte rom\u00e1nico como un estilo completamente homog\u00e9neo en el doble plano espacial y cronol\u00f3gico, d\u00e1ndose \"variedades regionales\" y una evoluci\u00f3n temporal de maduraci\u00f3n y decadencia.\n\nEn Espa\u00f1a, la peculiar situaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y geogr\u00e1fica en los siglos en que se desarrolla, va a imponer una serie de condicionantes especiales, con respecto a otros estados vecinos.

It can grow as a vine and climb up trees, even killing trees, but in most scenarios it grows upwards in single strands with three leaves all under the oak woodland canopy, Douglas-fir forest canopy, and the chaparral biomes of California. It tends to be evenly spaced because it reproduces vegetatively a lot of the time by creeping rootstocks, but at least it grows very conspicuously, so unless you don't know what this plant is or don't care, you'll be able to easily avoid it. This is a shape-shifter, so to speak: it can become a small tree in ample sunlight, be a vine, or a shrub. The leaves mostly occur in 3s, but sometimes in multiples of 5, 7, or 9; the leaves can have scalloped, toothed, or lobed edges. The leaves change colors, starting out bronze, then green, yellow, or red in the summer, and finally red or pink in the fall. Some campers have taken the defoliated branches in the winter to use for marshmallow roasting, only to be sent to the hospital.\n\nUnfortunately, I came into contact with some of this while filming a large European honey bee hive the week before, and did not realize that the toxin could go through clothing and cause mild hives on the skin underneath. This makes sense, as the toxin responsible for inducing an allergic response is an oil, and as you know, food oil stains on shirts tend to absorb into the cotton and spread out. The biochemical mechanism is a compound called urushiol that is in the oily resin found on the leaves and stems of this plant as well as related species such as poison ivy. Urushiol causes contact dermatitis, an autoimmune response in the skin that results in hives or an itchy rash in 80% of humans. I am among that 80%, and I had small hives on my torso underneath the parts of my shirt that had brushed against this annoying little weed. The itch was not particularly bad and I had no blisters or skin breakage, but it took upwards of 120 hours for the hives and itching to subside! Some people don't develop an allergic response to urushiol until after repeated and frequent exposure. A fellow hiker told me that some Native American tribe used Western poison oak as an eye wash, but that sounds implausible, to put it politely. If anyone is unfortunate enough to find this growing on their property, I say clip them all with hedge clippers, then burn the hedge clippers and the gloves you were using to hold the hedge clippers!", "title": "Western Poison Oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum, San Diego, California", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T06:08:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbRETIJEtR8", "description": "http://www.ontheroadwithAE.tv\nhttp://www.twitter.com/elmakias", "title": "Asking Alexandria - Preshow Warmups 2", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T04:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbRkYoWajVs", "description": "Free Download: http://on.fb.me/T11q61 \npreset for Sylenth1 v2.2\nThis in-depth tutorial shows you to make a rising pitch synth sweep buildup using Sylenth1.", "title": "Rising Pitch Synth Sweep Buildup (Sylenth1 Tutorial) \"Lucky Date\" \"Porter Robinson\" \"Zedd\"", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T07:53:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbS-71Wngxg", "description": "Natura litter bin\nEcological recycling litter bin. 50l capacity made from\ncardboard\nFolding and re-usable to minimize the space while being\nstored or transported\nMade from kraft cardboard humidity resistant\nModular.

It is the third-largest island in Europe and the twentieth-largest island on Earth. To its east is the island of Great Britain, from which it is separated by the Irish Sea.\n\nPolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland, which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, which covers the remaining area and is located in the north-east of the island. The population of Ireland is approximately 6.4 million. Just under 4.6 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe island's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate, which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until medieval times. As of 2013, the amount of land that is forested in Ireland is about 11% of the total land area, compared with European average of 35%. There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland.", "title": "Little Irish Talkers", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T22:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbV4slHhXLM", "description": "Taken from the Legends of Islam Conference: The Life of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah\n\n\nW: tarbeeyyah.com\nE: info@tarbeeyyah.com\nFB: www.facebook.com/TarbeeyyahCentre\n\nJoin our Mailing List to be updated with the latest events:\nhttp://eepurl.com/kj6Nn", "title": "What Can My Enemies Do To Me? | Shaykh Murtaza Khan | Tarbeeyyah Centre", "publishedDate": "2012-09-12T18:04:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbVAWMMywe8", "description": "Sorry no subs, but he looks so cute.", "title": "DBSG Changmin Graduating", "publishedDate": "2007-05-09T01:34:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbVXER0OmuQ", "description": "Native orchids captured in my local area\nHand held with Canon 60D and 100mm f2/8 lens\n\nMusic by Jason Pfaff - Thinking of You\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/", "title": "Native Orchids of Western Australia", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T09:41:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "AbVr9BNglgM", "description": "Cambay West Village home for sale close to all conveniences\n\n3424 Beretania Way Sacramento Ca 95834\n5 bedroom 3 bath home for sale.

It headed westward, slowly strengthening to a tropical storm on the 4th. Due to a ridge to the north, it looped on the 7th and 8th and became a typhoon on the way. While heading southwestward towards the Philippines, Manny rapidly intensified to a 140 mph (230 km/h) typhoon before hitting the Philippines late on the 9th. It weakened over the islands, and upper level winds kept it from restrengthening much over the South China Sea. Manny dissipated on the 16th over the Malay Peninsula, after causing 230 deaths, only one week after Lola hit the same area. Manny's track was unusual, given its time of year with a loop and a strengthening period to the southwest.

Is this possible?\"\n\nAwesome question, and a great excuse to do some math.\n\nAs we learned in a previous video, there are 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way and more than 100 billion galaxies in the Universe - maybe as many as 500 billion.\n\nIf you multiply stars by galaxies, at the low end, you get 10 billion billion stars, or 10 sextillion stars in the Universe - a 1 followed by 22 zeros.\n\nAt the high end, it's 200 sextillion.\n\nThese are mind bogglingly huge numbers.\n\nHow do they compare to the number of grains of sand on the collective beaches of an entire planet?\n\nThis type of sand measures about a half millimeter across. \n\nYou could put 20 grains of sand packed in side-by-side to make a centimeter. 8000 grains in one cubic centimeter.\n\nIf you took 10 sextillion grains of sand, put them into a ball, it would have a radius of 10.6 kilometers.\n\nAnd for the high end of our estimate, 200 sextillion, it would be 72 kilometers across.\n\nIf we had a sphere bigger than the Earth, it would be an easy answer, but no such luck. This might be close.\n\nSo, is there that much sand on all the beaches, everywhere, on this planet?\n\nYou'd need to estimate the average volume of a sandy beach and the average amount of the world's coastlines which are beaches.\n\nI'm going to follow the estimates and calculations made by Dr. Jason Marshall, aka, the Math Dude. \n\nAccording to Jason, there about 700 trillion cubic meters of beach of Earth, and that works out to around 5 sextillion grains of sand.\n\nJason reminds us that his math is a rough estimate, and he could be off by a factor of 2 either way. So it could be 2.5 sextillion or there could be 10 sextillion grains of sand on all the world's beaches.\n\nSo, if the low end estimate for the number of stars matches the high end estimate for the number of grains of sand, it's the same. \n\nBut more likely, there are 5 to 10 times more stars than there are grains of sand on all the world's beaches.\n\nSo, there's your answer, Sheldon. For some \"back of the napkin\" math we can guess that there are more stars in our Universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of Earth.\n\nOh, one more thing.\n\nInstead of grains of sand, what about atoms? \n\nHow big is 10 sextillion atoms? \n\nHow huge would something with that massive quantity of anything be? \n\nPretty gigantic. Well, relatively at least. 10 sextillion of anything does sound like a whole lot.\n\nIf you were to make a pile of that many atoms... guess how big it would be.\n\nIt'd be about.... (gesture big then gesture small) 4 times smaller than a dust mite. \n\nWhich means, a single grain of sand has more atoms than there are stars in the Universe.", "title": "Are There More Grains of Sand Than Stars?", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T15:24:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "Abgyl49Isqo", "description": "Sailing my 1870 gaff cutter, Emma of Bosham, off Frinton, Essex and taking some close-ups of her gear. 24 foot on deck and 8 foot six inches beam she is a New York Sloop which was a very common workboat on the eastern seaboard of the States.

A fast, maneuverable surface combatant, the LCS provides warfighting capabilities and operational flexibility for focused missions including mine-clearing, anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Led by prime contractor Lockheed Martin, the team includes naval architect Gibbs & Cox and ship builder Marinette Marine Corporation, a Fincantieri company.\n\nThe Lockheed Martin team has designed and constructed two ships for this new class. The team constructed USS Freedom (LCS 1), which was delivered to the Navy in 2008 and successfully completed its first deployment in 2010, two years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe team's second LCS, Fort Worth (LCS 3), is 99 percent complete at Marinette Marine's Wisconsin shipyard, and is awaiting U.S. Navy acceptance trials this spring. Improvements made from lessons learned on the first LCS to Fort Worth include added buoyancy, 10 percent more fuel capacity and extra length which helps increase ship speed and efficiency.\n\nThe team's next two ships -- the Milwaukee (LCS 5) and the Detroit (LCS 7) -- are currently under construction. In March, the Navy issued a contract modification to the Lockheed Martin team to build the Little Rock (LCS 9) and Sioux City (LCS 11) as part of the Navy's revised 2010 acquisition strategy. The strategy calls for 10 ships to be awarded to the Lockheed Martin-led team between 2010 and 2015.\n\nPurpose\n\nLCS is a critically important shipbuilding program for the US Navy to defend our national interests and demands the best skill and effort from industry teams to be successful.\n\nWhat It Replaces\n\nThe 55 LCS-class ships will replace 30 FFG-7 Oliver Hazard Perry Class frigates, 14 MCM Avenger Class mine countermeasures vessels, 12 MHC-51 Osprey Class coastal mine hunters.\n\nUnique Manning Concept\n\nAs designed, LCS operates with considerably less manning (40 core sailors) plus support crew for the aviation and mission packages to operate the reconfigurable mission modules.\n\nMission Packages\n\nThe LCS platform is flexible and reconfigurable. In theater, the LCS acts as a hub -- tying together sea, air and land assets. When deployed to address a threat, a ship can be reconfigured for a specific mission in days. Three mission packages include: Mine Warfare, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and Surface Warfare.\n\n\u25a0Anti-submarine package elements include: MH-60 Romeo carrying an active dipping sonar, sonobuoys and heavy-weight torpedos.\n\u25a0Mine countermeasures package requires two operators, and searches twice as fast as legacy systems. Elements include: the Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle, AQS-20A Variable Depth Sonar, Launch & Recovery Subsystem.\n\u25a0The surface warfare package provides fleet protection from small boats and other asymmetric threats. Includes Gun Mission Module MK 50 MOD, a Non-Line of Sight Launch System Mission Module, a MH-60R Helicopter, Vertical Takeoff Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and a Maritime Security Module.\n\nMaintenance and Sustainment\n\nDriving down costs in areas like transportation, upkeep and storage\n\nLockheed Martin-led LCS team has been building the foundation to sustainment efforts to performance-based environment. We selected the most qualified, cost-effective suppliers to address inventory and spares management and obsolescence.\n\nWorldwide maintenance support\n\nWith Lockheed Martin's global network of industrial partners' maintenance and depot facilities, the LCS can be serviced in areas not fully supported by U.S. infrastructure.\n\nStreamlined, automated enterprise logistics\n\nLockheed Martin is establishing the foundation for extensive condition-based maintenance implementation in the near future -- a cornerstone of affordability.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nCreating Jobs\n\nThis contract award of 10 ships to the Lockheed Martin/Marinette Marine / Gibbs & Cox team provides significant economic benefits. An economic impact study on the program found that it at the program's peak (2014, delivering two ships/year), the Lockheed Martin/Marinette Marine LCS program can generate nearly 13,000 jobs across the nation.\n\nSupporting Local Business\n\nWith more than 700 suppliers in 43 states, LCS subcontractors include Rolls Royce, Fairbanks Morse, BAE, EADS and Raytheon, among others. The Marinette Marine shipyard is expanding its facilities and hiring more employees in the next few years to support production of two LCSs per year.", "title": "Lockheed Martin - Fort Worth Littoral Combat Ship 3 (LCS 3) : Full Speed Ahead [1080p]", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T05:32:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ac4z-bvplMs", "description": "Short instructional video of hatha yoga Hero (Virasana) and Reclining Hero (Supta Virasana) kneeling poses.

He wrote the script because he rarely understood the technical copy he was asked to read and felt he shouldn't be alone. We had just finished a production for GMC Trucks and Bud asked since this was the perfect setting could we film his Turbo Encabulator script. He was using an audio prompter referred to as \"the ear\". He was actually the pioneer of the ear. He was to deliver a live speech without a prompter. After struggling in his hotel room trying to commit to memory he went to plan B. He recorded it to a large Wollensak reel to reel recorder and placed it in the bottom of the podium. With a wired earplug he used it for the speech and the \"ear\" was invented. Today every on-camera spokesperson uses a variation of Bud's innovation. Dave Rondot (me) was the director and John Choate was the DP on this production. The first laugh at the end is mine.

A real deal: an original performance with an internationally acclaimed Italian master, Antonio Fava.\n\nPremiered in Brisbane in 2010, the performance presents authentic Italian Comedia scenerarios, centered around the famous character, Pulcinella. Pulcinella is one of the typical characters of Commedia dell'Arte, one of the over two hundred variations of 'zanni II', the 'foolish servant'. Pulcinella in this sense, is only a name just as 'Arlecchino', Franceschina, 'Truffaldino', 'Traccagnino', 'Tabacchino', Zagna, Zezza, and so on are simply other names for 'zanni II'.\n\nThanks to this immensely human \"boor\", filthy, character, urbanized in Naples from the countryside, ugly, ignorant, lazy, jealous, greedy, hungry of maccarune and love, Commedia, the Mask and Improvisation will never will loose its relevance.\n\nFava's Pulcinella is also superstitious. Pulcinella, Donna Zezza, Tartaglia and all the characters involved in the stories are confronted with the crossing - a single, quick, scary crossing - of a black cat, that shakes their existence like an earthquake for the entire play. The consequences won't exclude any of humanity's greatest themes: Fear, Starvation, Love, Survival, Life ... Death - with a happy ending of course.\n\nDVD, NTSC/PAL\nYear 2012\nLength 148 mins\nDVD available from\nEurope, UK: http://www.artfilms.co.uk/Detail.aspx?ItemID=4677\nUS, Australia, World: http://www.artfilms.com.au/Detail.aspx?ItemID=4810\nSTREAMING: http://www.artfilms-digital.com", "title": "Black Comedy alla Pulcinella by Antonio Fava - Screener", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T10:30:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AcN7YIkYZgk", "description": "", "title": "Der Falter und das Licht", "publishedDate": "2011-11-10T22:05:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AcNCs0ZdSLE", "description": "Short homemade video.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "How to Treat Eczema - Natural Ways to Help Put an End to This Skin Problem", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T09:51:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ad22evCk1nM", "description": "\uae40\ud3ec \uc591\uace1\ub9ac  \ub0c9\uc774 \uce90\uae30", "title": "\ub0c9\uc774 \uce90\ub7ec\uc654\uc5b4\uc694.

It is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, a quarter the diameter of Earth and 1/81 its mass, and is the second densest satellite after Io. It is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face; the near side is marked with dark volcanic maria among the bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Despite being the brightest object in the sky after the Sun, its surface is actually very dark, with a similar reflectance to coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have since ancient times made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, the calendar, art and mythology. The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to be the same size in the sky as the Sun  allowing the Moon to cover the Sun precisely in total solar eclipses.\n\nThe Moon is the only celestial body on which humans have made a manned landing. While the Soviet Union's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft, the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972  the first being Apollo 11 in 1969. These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins (it is thought to have formed some 4.5 billion years ago in a giant impact), the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history.\n\nMoon \nOrbital characteristics \nPerigee 363,104 km (0.0024 AU) \nApogee 405,696 km (0.0027 AU) \nSemi-major axis 384,399 km (0.00257 AU)\nEccentricity 0.0549\nOrbital period 27.321582 d (27 d 7 h 43.1 min) \nSynodic period 29.530589 d (29 d 12 h 44 min 2.9 s) \nAverage orbital speed 1.022 km/s \nInclination 5.145\u00b0 to the ecliptic\n(between 18.29\u00b0 and 28.58\u00b0 to Earth's equator) \nLongitude of ascending node regressing by one revolution in 18.6 years \nArgument of perigee progressing by one revolution in 8.85 years \nSatellite of Earth \nPhysical characteristics \nMean radius 1,737.10 km  (0.273 Earths)\nEquatorial radius 1,738.14 km (0.273 Earths) \nPolar radius 1,735.97 km  (0.273 Earths)\nFlattening 0.00125 \nCircumference 10,921 km (equatorial) \nSurface area 3.793 \u00d7 107 km2  (0.074 Earths) \nVolume 2.1958 \u00d7 1010 km3  (0.020 Earths) \nMass 7.3477 \u00d7 1022 kg  (0.0123 Earths) \nMean density 3,346.4 kg/m3\nEquatorial surface gravity 1.622 m/s2 (0.165 4 g) \nEscape velocity 2.38 km/s \nSidereal rotation\nperiod 27.321582 d (synchronous) \nEquatorial rotation velocity 4.627 m/s \nAxial tilt 1.5424\u00b0 (to ecliptic)\n6.687\u00b0 (to orbit plane) \nAlbedo 0.136 \nSurface temp. min     mean   max \n   equator       100 K  220 K  390 K \n   85\u00b0N            70 K   130 K  230 K \n \nApparent magnitude \u22122.5 to \u221212.9\n\u221212.74 (mean full Moon)\nAngular diameter 29.3 to 34.1 arcminutes\nAtmosphere \nSurface pressure 10\u22127 Pa (day)\n10\u221210 Pa (night) \nComposition Ar, He, Na, K, H, Rn", "title": "Lunar Rotation", "publishedDate": "2010-05-14T21:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ad6K1ahNt3g", "description": "Saint Seiya Brave Soldiers\nPlatform : PS3\n\nSeiya God Cloth vs Poseidon\n\nJust a short video showing some gameplay from Saint Seiya Brave Soldiers.\nThe difficulty was on Normal to show the gameplay possibilities (combo cancel, big bang attack) otherwise the AI would have escape my combos xD.", "title": "Saint Seiya Brave Soldiers - Seiya God Cloth vs Poseidon", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T23:20:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ad6L-AfNrmY", "description": "We get deliveries to our camera store every day and they are always ridiculously overpacked.

Giovani romani come Daniele Silvestri e Niccol\u00f2 Fabi  circolano e salgono sul palco insieme a tanti altri musicisti: da Sergio Cammariere-Stress a Max Gazz\u00e8 (bassista di Silvestri, appena selezionato per il prossimo Sanremo Giovani), fino a Rocco Papaleo, che ha esordito con uno strepitoso album. Tra i motivi che possono spiegare tanto successo, c' \u00e8 il fatto che i \"gestori\" del Locale in realt\u00e0 sono attori e musicisti - come Giorgio Baldi, chitarrista del gruppo Delle Iene, o Alberto Molinari e Federico Scribani attori nel cast di Volevamo essere gli U2 - che a turno controllano l' ingresso, servono al bar, puliscono i pavimenti. \"ESTATE ' 93. Ero appena tornato dalla California, dove avevo preso il master in oceanografia all' universit\u00e0 di Santa Barbara. E come ho messo piede a Roma ho cercato Giorgio Baldi (ora chitarrista di Max Gazz\u00e9), mio compagno di scuola e di concerti al Mamiani, il liceo di Prati. Volevo ricominciare a suonare, magari in una cantina tutta nostra dove poter anche invitare gli amici la sera\". Cos\u00ec Andrea Marotti, 33 anni, racconta come gli venne l' idea di aprire \"Il Locale\", il club che in pochissime stagioni \u00e8 diventato la fucina della \"nuova scuola romana\" forte di personaggi giovani o gi\u00e0 affermati come Max Gazz\u00e9, Niccol\u00f2 Fabi, Alex Britti e Daniele Silvestri. \". La storia che racconta Andrea, cantante rock e oceanografo, continua con una lunga ricerca negli scantinati della capitale: ma alla fine un annuncio su Porta Portese si rivel\u00f2 quello buono. \"Appena io e Giorgio mettemmo piede nella cantina di Vicolo del Fico ci rendemmo conto che era il posto giusto. E poche sere dopo suonavano con la nostra band, i Delle Iene\". Poco dopo ai due fondatori si un\u00ec Alberto Molinari, 33 anni, bassista e attore: suon\u00f2 con i Delle Iene, che erano la \"house- band\" del Locale ma che ogni sera ospitavano altri musicisti. Poi Alberto cominci\u00f2 a suonare anche con i \"Schifosa Sci\u00f2 Quintet\", cover-band con Federico Scribani cantante. Qualche anno dopo Molinari e Scribani furono protagonisti di \"Volevamo essere gli U2\", grande successo a teatro e al cinema. E al Locale erano in tanti a sognare di vivere con la musica, come Matthew Marston, un ragazzo americano con la chitarra (si present\u00f2 proprio con lo strumento a tracolla, un pomeriggio del ' 94). Matthew - che sta per incidere il suo primo disco italiano - \u00e8 texano e come molti protagonisti di questa storia \u00e8 un autentico girovago della musica. Altri esempi? Alex Britti, che nel ' 95 per la prima volta suon\u00f2 le sue cover di blues al Locale, andava e tornava da mezza Europa dove ha suonato in grandi club e per strada, da vero busker. E Max Gazz\u00e9 che si un\u00ec a \"quelli del Locale\" nel ' 94, all' epoca era appena tornato da un lunghissimo periodo all' estero tra Belgio, Inghilterra, Francia, Romania. Tutti questi ragazzi con la valigia hanno raccontato e cantato le loro storie insieme a tanti altri giovani artisti romani che si sono spostati meno dalla capitale, come Niccol\u00f2 Fabi e Daniele Silvestri, altri protagonisti di quella scena romana di cantautori nata in questa sorta di Folkstudio degli anni Novanta. E tra gli altri che potrebbero seguire le orme dei pi\u00f9 fortunati c' \u00e8 Sergio Cammariere, vincitore di una targa Tenco, che in una bollente notte di musica trascin\u00f2 Lucio Dalla a suonare il sax al suo fianco al Locale. Il cantautore bolognese non \u00e8 l' unico big ad aver suonato nel club: pochi giorni fa c' \u00e8 passato Bon Jovi (ha suonato con nuove trib\u00f9 zulu), e ancora Jakob Dylan e Elio e le Storie tese. E intanto incalzano anche le rockband come gli Elettrojoyce.  La fila fuori dal Locale una costante, da nicchia a moda. Da salotto di famiglia a salotto con sfumature radical chic. Ogni musicista tra i big italiani e stranieri, finito il concerto allo stadio o al palazzetto, chiudeva la nottata nel 'covo' di via del Fico per bere qualcosa, ogni giornalista musicale e non sapeva che l\u00ec poteva trovare spunti, notizie o contatti con artisti di teatro, televisione o cinema. \"Senza dimenticare i produttori discografici -- corregge Giorgio Baldi -- erano tutti a bordo palco per prender appunti. Allora non c'era Internet, n\u00e9 i talent show, tantomeno i portali come Youtube. La musica andava suonata dal vivo\".  Per Niccol\u00f2 intende Fabi. \"Lui e i suoi capelli erano una certezza -- incalza Baldi -- un successo. Per questo gli avevamo assegnato due serate fisse al mese, sold out ogni volta\". Sorride Max Gazz\u00e8. Anche lui un giorno manda un demo con un paio di registrazioni. Quindi il debutto. \"Ero sempre l\u00ec, tanto da conoscere prima e innamorarmi poi della barista. E' diventata mia moglie\".", "title": "Nicc & Max - gli Starsky e Hutch de IL LOCALE di Vicolo del Fico", "publishedDate": "2013-05-03T12:31:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdA7Sp6JqvU", "description": "We find a Steenbok during one of our game drives!

FreedomPop is undoubtedly aware of that thriftiness, as it just started offering its namesake free service on tablets. Whether you buy one of the carrier's pre-supplied tablets or bring your own, you'll get the same gratis 500MB of LTE data, 500 messages and 200 voice minutes as a phone customer. That may not make sense at first, but FreedomPop reckons that it's important for apps that ask for a phone number. It's much easier to hail an Uber car when you can supply some digits, for example. It could also serve as a backup if your phone's battery dies, or if you're nearing your limits on a capped phone plan.\nThe catch, besides the relatively low 500MB data ceiling, is the device selection. FreedomPop is selling only the aging Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 ($199) and original iPad mini ($319 refurbished), and any tablet of your own will have to play nicely with the Sprint network that FreedomPop uses for LTE. You're getting more free data than T-Mobile offers, though, and the phone functionality should be icing on the cake.\n\ufffdComments\n\n\nRead more here: FreedomPop&#39;s free data and voice are now available on tablets\n \n http://www.freewebpagesearch.com/?p=82", "title": "FreedomPop&#39;s free data and voice are now available on tablets", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T11:41:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdPnMoxKOWY", "description": "SINGLE [TURN IT UP]\n\u25b6 NOW available on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/T.O.PTurnItUp\n\u25b6 BIGBANG Products on eBay: http://stores.ebay.com/ygentertainment\n\nFor More Information @\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bigbang\nhttp://twitter.com/ygent_official\nhttp://me2day.net/ygonair\nhttp://ygbigbang.com\nApp Store: http://goo.gl/l9TU6\nGoogle Play: http://goo.gl/UiEn1", "title": "T.O.P - TURN IT UP M/V", "publishedDate": "2010-06-17T07:54:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdQ2dDQ0upM", "description": "As Managing Director of Egypt's Social Fund for Development, a state-owned entity responsible for developing small-scale enterprise, Ghada Waly has taken considerable interest in women's economic inclusion and empowerment.

(Well, possibly diamond dust on drill bits was first, I'm not 100% certain.)\n\nThe jewels used in watches are usually rubies, sapphires (which are chemically the same as rubies), garnets and diamonds. After around 1900, most of the rubies used were synthetic. Before 1900, the jewels were either from stones that were too small or had too many flaws to be used in jewelry. In either case, they really weren't that costly. There is often a correlation between the price of the watch and number of jewels, but the jewels themselves are not the cause of this higher price.\n\nReducing friction is an extremely important goal in watchmaking. Jewels have two important properties that help reduce friction. First, they can be made to be very smooth, and therefore they let the metal parts slide easily. Secondly, they are very hard and therefore don't wear down very quickly. The gears in a watch are carefully designed so that the teeth roll on each other, rather than sliding. If the axle of a gear wears away the hole that it sit in, the gear will shift. That means the teeth will no longer roll on each other and therefore friction will be increased.\n\nTypes of Jewels\nThere are several different types of jewels used in a watch, the most common are:\n\n    * Hole Jewels:   These are donut shaped jewels that fit over the gear axles (in watch lingo, the wheel arbors).\n    * Cap Jewels:   These are flat jewels that are placed on the ends of the axles (arbors).\n    * Pallet Jewels:   These are brick shaped jewels on the pallet fork that alternately engage and release the escape wheel. The escape wheel is the gear with funny \"boot\" shaped teeth.\n    * Roller Jewel:   This jewel is on the large balance wheel that swings back and forth. It engages with the pallet fork on the end opposite of the pallet jewels.\n\nThe jewels are carefully shaped so that the capillary action of the oil causes the oil to be drawn toward the gear arbors instead of spreading out where it doesn't do any good.\nSource: http://elginwatches.org/help/watch_jewels.html\nSource of music: Tobit.fm mood radio", "title": "Seiko 5 Aoutomatic watch 23 lewels, Tobit.fm", "publishedDate": "2009-03-26T15:37:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdRbFlvFY48", "description": "Yep semi major update check out Super Nova Gaming OK bye.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SuperNovaGaming", "title": "Major Update..........Kinda????", "publishedDate": "2011-01-15T03:55:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdRzpFs3vl8", "description": "Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built the first steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Chinese Emperor. It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Mansory Panamera Turbo Launch followed by TT Gallardo", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:01:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdSCLNg0xpM", "description": "http://drcraigvideos.blogspot.com - Dr. William Lane Craig deals with the refutation of whether the cosmological argument begs the question and engages in circular reasoning.

The groups sought to expose the secret negotiations that have been ongoing throughout the five years of the Obama administration and mobilize people concerned about workers, the environment, banking, food, water, Internet freedom and other issues to take action to oppose the TPP.  The TPP will give large transnational corporations absolute power over our lives and make them more powerful than governments.\n\nIf the TPP becomes law the US government will have negotiated away the sovereignty of US communities to deal with food, water, health, the environment and other issues. It will have put in place an economy rigged for the wealthiest that will cost the US jobs and drive down wages.  Experience with agreements like NAFTA have taught us that these agreements are not good for the economy, increase US trade debt, hurt workers in the US and foreign countries and only help the wealthiest.  A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the US would see only a .1% increase in the economy if the TPP becomes law but 90% of workers would see their wages go down.  These agreements are misnamed \"free\" trade for propaganda purposes as what they really are is \"rigged\" trade building on the corrupt crony capitalist economy that funnels money to the wealthiest transnational corporations. Foreign governments should wake up and realize the TPP will put them at the mercy of US trans national corporations.\n\nThe first battle is stopping Fast Track which undermines the US Constitution which under the Commerce Clause gives Congress responsibility to negotiate trade between nations.  This should be opposed by members of Congress no matter what their political viewpoint because it is a Constitutional issue that upsets the checks and balances of government. It puts too much power in the hands of the president without sufficient involvement of the Congress.  Call your member of Congress and Senators today and urge them to oppose Fast Track authority for the president: 202-224-3121.\n\nGroups participating in this protest included Flush The TPP, Popular Resistance, Backbone Campaign, Earth First!, CODE PINK and Veterans for Peace.\n\nFor more information, visit FlushtheTPPdotorg.", "title": "Flush The TPP: U.S. Trade Representative's Office 9-23", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T05:39:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdWrESZU4Ok", "description": "LYRICS ALBANIAN AND ENGLISH:\n\nPartizani n'luft\u00eb po shkonte\nKa marr\u00eb pushk\u00ebn me nj\u00eb dor\u00eb.\n\nThe partisan to fight is heading\nKeeps the rifle strong on his hand.\n\nLamtumir\u00eb o n\u00ebn\u00eb e bab\u00eb\nLamtumir\u00eb o motr'e re.\n\nFarewell o mother and father\nFarewell o my young sister.\n\nDit\u00eb p\u00ebr dit\u00eb n\u00ebna priste\nNdonj\u00eb lajm prej djalit saj.\n\nDay after day the mother is waiting\nAny news from her son.\n\nKur nj\u00eb dit\u00eb letra mbrriti\nDrejt prej malit ka ardh\u00eb fjal\u00eb:\nDjali yt ka mbarue\nMe fashist\u00ebt ka luftu.\n\nWhen a day the letter came\nStraight from the mountains they bring word:\nYour son has fallen\nFighting against the fascists.\n\nN\u00ebna thoshte: Lumja un\u00eb,\nM'u vra djali p\u00ebr liri.\n\nAnd the mother said: Lucky me,\nMy son is son of the freedom now!\n\n---\nEternal glory to the heroic struggle of the Albanian partisans against the fascism and its collaborationist.

What is not quite clear is the influence of patient selection bias on the perceived benefits of HHD. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of HHD by comparing the admission patterns of HHD patients with a control group from a reasonably well dialysis patient cohort, which in this case were satellite hemodialysis patients on a Category 1 transplant waiting list (Cat1 SHD).\n\nMethods: A single center retrospective randomized cohort study of HHD and Cat1 SHD patients who were on these two treatment modalities from August 2012 to August 2013 was performed to obtain a sample of 25 patients for each group.\n\nResults: The mean length of stay in hospital was 5.9 days for HHD patients and 6.7 days for Cat1 SHD group (P=0.8). Eighteen admissions were observed for both groups (0.72 admissions/patient-year; P=0.5). HHD patients spent 71 days and Cat1 SHD patients spent 85 days in hospital (2.8 and 3.4 days/patient-year respectively; P,0.005). The mean serum potassium level for HHD patients was 4.1 (3.1--6.5) mEq/L versus 5.0 (3.7--6.1) mEq/L for Cat1 SHD patients (P=0.001) and the mean phosphate level was 1.1 (0.56--2.38) mg/dL and 1.5 (0.43--3.2) mg/dL (P=0.02) for the respective groups.\n\nConclusion: This study confirms the superiority of the HHD treatment option in improving patient outcomes. Admission patterns of HHD patients fared very well against a control group which consisted of reasonably well dialysis patients.\n\nRead in the original research paper here: http://www.dovepress.com/how-do-hospitalization-patterns-of-home-hemodialysis-patients-compare--peer-reviewed-article", "title": "Hospitalization patterns of home hemodialysis patients - Video abstract 65385", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T23:33:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "Adh26L9tJ3M", "description": "This is the \"book trailer\" for our recently released title, \"Twin Souls Merging: George Reeves & Jean Cline--A Psychological and Spiritual Journey.\"\n\nThe \"EVP\" occurs in a section of footage from the year 2000 near the end of the book trailer.

This is Max Tapper again for Howcast. And what I'm going to show you guys how to do today is the incline press up. Yes, incline press up. Basically the same thing as the incline push up but some call it different things. I'm going to show you how to do it. All right.\n\nThis is what it is. Basically, like a basic push up but you\u2019re going to use a bench to put your body on an incline. All right. This is what it's going to look like. Chest up. Angle down. Up. Up. Now, what this is very useful for is for building the upper pec and shoulder. All right. Excellent exercise to mix in as a secondary exercise behind like say a chest press or a dumbbell press. This is an awesome exercise to add in. \n\nSo one of the good reasons to do an incline push up is, if you don't have enough strength at this moment yet to do a regular flat push up. What this does, it takes away a certain amount of your body weight so you're only lifting a certain percentage of it. And it makes it a little bit easier. \n\nSo for people that are looking in to building chest strength and working up to doing a normal push up, this is an awesome transition to it. So remember, an incline press is awesome for you. Helps you build up your strength. Go out there. Do it. Have a good time.

The end of the video shows Marko Vovk doing the \"Switch and Bait\"  Please rate and Subscribe. \nBelow is the real history of Windex.\nWindex is a hard-surface cleaner glass and manufactured since 1933. S. C. Johnson acquired Windex in 1993 and has been manufacturing it since and reformulated in 2006. Windex was originally colored a light, transparent shade of blue  but variety of colors  are marketed today  such as ocean fresh blue, sunshine lemon, citrus orange, with fragrances such as but no limited to  spring bouquet, ocean mist, lavender and tea tree. Windex today also has several additives such as vinegar, lemon, lime, or orange juice.\nWindex was invented in 1933 by Harry R. Drackett. Back in those days, Windex  was  100% solvent,  highly flammable, and sold in metal cans. Today  In the late 1980s, Windex was a 5% ammonia solution in 1989. Today the The Sam Wise patent #3,463,735 lists example formulae, one of which is 4.0% isopropyl alcohol (a highly volatile solvent) 1% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (a less volatile solvent), 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (a surfactant), 0.01% tetrasodium pyrophosphate (a water softener), 0.05% of 28% ammonia, 1% of a dye solution, and 0.01% perfume. This cleaner is a chemical and should not be indested as some YouTube Windex Prank Videos show. Windex should not be confused with  a bartender tinted mixed drink called the \"Windex Shot\" which contains vodka, triple sec and Blue Curaccao.", "title": "How To Remove Smoke Tar Nicoteen Stains From Cleveland Home Inspector Marko Vovk", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T23:55:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "Adw3S8Phh2M", "description": "The diamondback terrapin was once hunted almost to extinction as a delicacy in American cuisine.

Brancato, Michael Ferris\nFilm Description: The fourth installment of the Terminator series follows an adult John Connor (played by Christian Bale) as he attempts to organize a human resistance force which could prove to be mankind's last true hope in the war against the machines. Opening in the year 2018, Terminator Salvation finds John Connor's certainty about the future shaken by the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), whose last memory is of sitting on death row and awaiting execution. Unable to determine whether Marcus was sent from the future or rescued from the past, Connor begins to wonder whether there is still any hope left for the human race as the robots grow more powerful and aggressive than ever before. It appears that Skynet is preparing a devastating final attack designed to eliminate the human resistance once and for all, leaving Connor and Marcus with no choice but to strike back at the cybernetic heart of Skynet's operations. Once there, the two battle-scarred soldiers discover a devastating secret regarding the potential annihilation of all humankind. Anton Yelchin fills Michael Biehn's shoes as a young Kyle Reese in the first installment of a planned Terminator trilogy from director McG (Charlie's Angels).\n\n\"terminator salvation\",\"terminator salvation clip\",\"terminator salvation trailer\",\"terminator salvation theme\",\"christian bale\",mcg,\"bomb videos\",\"gun videos\",\"helicopter videos\",\"machine gun videos\",\"rifle videos\",\"rocket launcher videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"mario kassar\",\"andrew g vajna\",\"joel b michaels\",\"moritz borman\",\"thomas hayslip\",\"peter d graves\",\"chantal feghali\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++398155,/m/01wy5m", "title": "Terminator Salvation (1/10) Movie CLIP - Attack on Skynet (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T18:43:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdzBFNo81w4", "description": "My cat Jake.", "title": "PCTV Resorption Lesions", "publishedDate": "2009-02-14T19:29:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AdzBjYaiwh8", "description": "Icewagon Flu performing \"South Australia\" at ShamrockFest in Washington DC on March 14, 2009.

Let's start from the beginning. If you happen to have a host or a hostess who is having a dinner or having you for a meal, you want to follow their lead. So, don't sit down until they sit down. Also, don't put your napkin in your lap until they put their napkin in their lap. \n\nNow, if we're just dining out at a restaurant, first thing you want to think about is getting yourself seated and putting your napkin in your lap. That's pretty much the first thing you want to do at any table setting. As you're interacting at the table, make sure that you don't put your elbows on the table. This is kind of a dining taboo. Basically if you have your elbows on the table that means that you're probably leaning over the table which you don't want to do. However you can rest your wrists on the table. So, if you're seated here you can rest you wrists like this.\n\nIn terms of salt and pepper, if someone asks you to pass the salt, you should actually pass both the salt and the pepper together. They always move around the table as a pair. Have you ever sat down at a table and had a number of utensils in front of you and you're really nervous about which one you should use for which course? It's actually really simple. You start from the outside utensils and you move inward. So, the first thing that comes to you should be used with the outermost utensil. Let's say this was a salad. We're obviously going to be using this fork rather than this spoon. If this was a soup, we'd be using the spoon first. \n\nWhile you're at the table you might want to take a break from eating. So what you're going to want to do with your utensils is put them in what we call the resting position. So, you would take your utensils and put them like this. If the plate were a clock, this would actually be approximately on the eight. This knife would be approximately at the four. When you're finished with your meal, your utensils go in the finished position. This is where both utensils are approximately on a four if this were a clock. You want to be sure that the handles of your utensils are actually hanging off the back of your plate. This is just so that a server actually doesn't have to pick your utensils up off of a dirty plate. \n\nIf you need to leave the table during the meal, you put your napkin on the chair. In a formal restaurant they're probably going to come by, re-fold your napkin, and put it back to the left of your plate. And when you're finished with your meal, you're going to want to put your napkin back to the left hand side of your plate. It doesn't belong on your plate. You don't want to get a cloth napkin dirty with food. It belongs right back where it started. Those are just a few of the do's and don'ts of table manners.", "title": "7 Table Manners Do's & Don'ts | Good Manners", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T16:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AeHxqvayYwQ", "description": "\" RELAX \"- Alexej Michail-MONIIM\nwww.donsphynx.sk\ntoshiba camileo BW 10", "title": "Don Sphynx.sk", "publishedDate": "2012-06-24T17:30:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "AeIDE5Uhz7k", "description": "How many lawsuits can fast food franchises get this year? \nWell McDonald's has its first, and it may cost them $1.5 million!!!\nYou may ask yourself, \"what is worth $1.5 mill?\" \nAllegedly, undue mental anguish......", "title": "WNW McDonald's Causes Guy \"Undue Mental Anguish\"", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12T04:22:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "AeIj0euJ0h0", "description": "Take a look at the DP7-PRO's high resolution Waveform.

Located in Kathmandu, Manushi works with women in various parts of the country. The group describes itself as \"action--oriented\" for the empowerment of women. The organization's goals are to promote gender perspective in sustainable development, to enhance women's social and economic status, to put women in the forefront of human development, and to put marginalized people in the world of work through handicraft production and small businesses. In addition to craft production and marketing, Manushi conducts community development, entrepreneurship and skills training, and provides microfinance loans. Currently some 90 percent of Manushi's artisans are women: all are from grassroots communities, some are widows, some are without family, and all are needy. Constitutionally Nepali women have rights, explains director Padmasana Shakya, but practically they have few opportunities within a culture that discriminates against women.\n\nManushi grew out of studies of women in Nepal done by the Center for Women in Development. Prompted by questions from the women interviewed about the studies' benefit, Shakya, then a university economics professor, established Manushi in 1991. Manushi began its microcredit program in 1996.\n\nTen Thousand Villages has purchased recycled silk scarves and bags, silver and semiprecious stone jewelry, and natural dye products from Manushi.

There She Went (2014) - Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader Western HD\n\nPresented by Roadside Attractions\n \nDirected by Tommy Lee Jones\n \nScreenplay written by Tommy Lee Jones, Kieran Fitzgerald (The Ballad of Esequiel Hern\u00e1ndez) and Wesley A. Oliver (The Company Men, No Country for Old Men), based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout (The Shootist).\n \nStarring Academy Award\u00ae-winners Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank, with a supporting cast featuring Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, Sonja Richter, Academy Award-nominees John Lithgow and Hailee Steinfeld, James Spader and Academy Award\u00ae-winner Meryl Streep.\n \nWhen three women living on the edge of the American frontier are driven mad by harsh pioneer life, the task of saving them falls to the pious, independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank). Transporting the women by covered wagon to Iowa, she soon realizes just how daunting the journey will be, and employs a low-life drifter, George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), to join her. The unlikely pair and the three women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, Sonja Richter) head east, where a waiting minister and his wife (Meryl Streep) have offered to take the women in.

You encourage my failure to cover your own. Self-righteous coward; with lies you gain the trust of many but when backs are turned you sow division. Using words as daggers you carve into the spines of those who placed in your their confidence; and so reveal the blackened heart once concealed.

So be mindful of your actions for they're what last. This I'm sure of: The hands that help exceed the hands that pray. Your foolish deeds hide not behind your foolish cross.

That's why boating safety is number one here.\" \n\nNo positive identification has been released.\n\nPREVIOUS STORY:\n\nSeveral agencies are trying to recover a body believed to be that of a man in his late 20's to early 30's found Sunday afternoon near channel marker 32.  The marker is only a general reference.  \n\nMembers of the Fort Myers Police Department responded to the Tarpon Street Pier in the Caloosahatchee River, however the body is about a half a mile from the river bank.\n\nThere is a crime scene set up at this location.
