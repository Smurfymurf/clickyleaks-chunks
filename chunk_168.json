Happy, sparkling, moving, the film highlights gospel and the blues, and is enriched by the presence of professional dancers, whose work shows clearly the beauty and \"swing\" of African-American dance.\n\n120 musicians, singers, and dancers are the heros of this film, created between 1969 and 1972 in the United States in New York, Philadelphia, and New Orleans. Notable performers include: George Benson, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, John Lee Hooker, Memphis Slim, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Milton Buckner, Buddy Tate, Buck Clayton, Jimmy Slyde...\n\nThe drummers Jo Jones and Cozy Cole are also featured in this film, and in this clip, Cozy Cole gives us a an amazing demonstration of his musical gift.\n\nThe primary intention of the director Louis Panassi\u00e9 was to bring this music to new admirers. This is why forty years ago in Paris, 10,000 students came to see his film \"L'Aventure du jazz.\" On this occasion they were stunned to encounter this popular music that they hardly knew before.\n\nIn this film, you also meet Louis Armstrong not long before his death, when he had almost stopped played the trumpet. He offers in this film a surprising intimacy that no camera had caught before.\n\nBonjour! You will find more information about this clip, and others, on my website: http//sites.gooogle.com/site/louispanassie.

On y voit notamment : George Benson, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, John Lee Hooker, Memphis Slim, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Milton Buckner, Buddy Tate, Buck Clayton, Jimmy Slyde...\nLes batteurs, Jo Jones et Cozy Cole en font partie, sont tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s dans ce reportage musical. Dans cet extrait, Cozy Cole nous offre une prestation \u00e9poustouflante de son g\u00e9nie musical.\nL'intention premi\u00e8re du r\u00e9alisateur Louis Panassi\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'amener \u00e0 cette musique de nouveaux adeptes. C'est ainsi qu'\u00e0 Paris, il y a pr\u00e8s de 40 ans, 10.000 \u00e9tudiants vinrent voir son film \"L'Aventure du Jazz\". A cette occasion ils d\u00e9couvrirent, avec stup\u00e9faction et enthousiasme, une musique populaire et donc du c\u0153ur dont ils ne connaissaient pas grand-chose.\nDans ce reportage musical d'une dur\u00e9e de 2h30, on voit aussi Louis Armstrong  rencontr\u00e9 peu avant sa mort et alors qu'il ne jouait pratiquement  plus de trompette. Il offre alors dans ce film \u00e0 l'objectif et aux spectateurs une intimit\u00e9 surprenante que nulle cam\u00e9ra n'avait encore capt\u00e9e.\nBonjour, vous trouverez plus d'informations sur mes reportages sur mon site http://sites.google.com/site/louispanassie et aussi sur d'autres th\u00e9matiques que j'ai abord\u00e9es durant ma longue vie d'aventurier-reporter qui commen\u00e7a en 1956 par le premier tour de L'Afrique en Harley-Davidson. \nComme vous l'aurez compris, j'ai v\u00e9cu et film\u00e9 des moments historiques, rares mais surtout inoubliables.

S\u00e5 drar han den gule og r\u00f8de redningssk\u00f8yta opp i 25 knop og oppover elva.\n\nRoyal Canadian Marine Search And Rescue, RCM-SAR, operer p\u00e5 vestkysten av Canada. Med 40 stasjoner og over 60 redningssk\u00f8yter utelukkende bemannet av frivillige, er RCM-SAR en av de viktigste beredskapsorganisasjonene for sj\u00f8sikkerheten i Britisk Columbia. Like s\u00f8r for flyplassen i Vancouver, finner vi stasjon nummer 10. Der treffer vi redningsmann Kevin Robertson. P\u00e5 stasjonen i Richmond bemanner over 40 frivillige mannskaper to redningssk\u00f8yter, en \u00e5pen og en lukket RIB. Operasjonsomr\u00e5det er blant annet deler av den 1375 kilometer lange Fraser River.\n\nKun redningsoppdrag\nGutta og jentene p\u00e5 stasjonen i Richmond er 3-6 p\u00e5 vaktlagene, og med sin hel\u00e5rsberedskap har de rundt 60 redningsoppdrag i l\u00f8pet av et \u00e5r, i hovedsak tildelt fra kystvakta. Serviceoppdrag slik vi kjenner det fra Redningsselskapet hjemme i Norge, med blant annet etterfylling av str\u00f8m eller drivstoff, er ikke deres ansvar. Slike oppdrag tar betalte akt\u00f8rer seg av. Men de rykker ut p\u00e5 forebyggende oppdrag n\u00e5r andre resurser ikke responderer,  eller for \u00e5 forhindre en alvorlig hendelse.\n\n600 hestekrefter\n\"Free aft\" - \"Free bow\", skipperen kvitterer og tar sk\u00f8yta ut fra flytebrygga, mens matrosen kaller opp kystvakta p\u00e5 VHF'en:\n\n\"Victoria Coastguard - This is RCM-SAR station 10, over.\"\n\"Victoria coastguard - go ahead\"\n\"We are going on a one hour tour...\"\n\" Victoria Coastguard - Roger that - Out!\"\n\nP\u00e5 turen opp Fraser River f\u00e5r vi virkelig sparket fra oss, med to trehundrehesters Yamaha firetaktere p\u00e5 hekken. Underveis hopper laksen stadig opp foran sk\u00f8yta og forteller tydelig at laksesesongen har startet.\n\nKjente utfordringer og Bobbie\nOgs\u00e5 i Canada er det kun krav om \u00e5 ha flyteplagg nok til alle ombord i b\u00e5ten, med de utfordringer og problemer det skaper, spesielt for oss redningsmannskaper. Som en kjent konsekvens driver ogs\u00e5 RCM-SAR aktivt med forebyggende og opplysende arbeid om viktigheten av \u00e5 alltid  bruke sin \"PFD\" (Personal Floating Device - Personlig Flyte Utstyr/Redningsvest).\n\nI det forebyggende arbeidet med barn og unge er \"Bobbie - The Saftey Boat\" en viktig medhjelper. Men i motsetning til v\u00e5r egen Elias, kj\u00f8res Bobbie fjernstyrt fra land.\n\n\u00d8velse og trening\nDe frivillige mannskapene \u00f8ver jevnlig, og f\u00f8rer n\u00f8ye statistikk p\u00e5 treningstimene. Som i Norge, har de en egen hurtigb\u00e5tsimulator der f\u00f8reren ratter en av deres sm\u00e5 lukkede b\u00e5ter. Her kan mannskapene testes i h\u00f8yhastighetskj\u00f8ring, navigasjon og radarbruk. Instrukt\u00f8r Francois har full kontroll p\u00e5 scenarioene han gir elevene, og med enkle tastetrykk legger han inn nye utfordringer. Han styrer d\u00f8gnet i forhold til sol, stjerner og v\u00e6r. Han kan ogs\u00e5 fylle havet med alt fra synkende tankere, lasteskip, fiskefart\u00f8y og redningsfl\u00e5ter, til drivgods og oljeflak i brann.\n\nAlle mannskaper som har v\u00e6rt med en stund og bevist sin interesse og dedikasjon m\u00e5 gjennomf\u00f8re kurs p\u00e5 simulatoren. Her f\u00e5r elevene f\u00f8rst teori, f\u00f8r det hele settes ut i praksis, f\u00f8rst i simulatoren og deretter ute i en ekte redningssk\u00f8yte.\n \n\nOm artikkelforfatteren:\nMads Henrik Rand\u00f8y er frivillig matros p\u00e5 RS Bendt R. Rasmussen i Kristiansand. P\u00e5 eget initiativ tok han turen til Canada for \u00e5 l\u00e6re mer om hvordan redningsarbeidet i Nord-Amerika fungerer. Tidligere har Rand\u00f8y blant annet bes\u00f8kt redningsstasjoner i New Zealand og Australia.\n\n- Det var et flott bes\u00f8k. Jeg m\u00e5 takke Kevin Robertson for et fantastisk opplegg. B\u00e5de turen med redningssk\u00f8yta og bes\u00f8ket p\u00e5 simulatoren var helt fantastisk, sier matrosen. \n\n\n\u00d8nsker du \u00e5 st\u00f8tte oss \u00f8konomisk?\nG\u00e5 inn p\u00e5 htttp://www.nautiskmil.no - Og velg RS 155 \"Bendt R.

Don't kick over the traces or you won't be able to upgrade your farm and to buy more land. Choose the right seed from different types of grains like barley, rye, or wheat or decide to grow canola or corn. The harvest can be used as animal food, new seed as well as product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices so you don't come out with losses after all the work.\n\nBecome cattle-breeder! \nGet another main pillar and breed cattle: cows, horses, sheep, hen, and geese. You may even have game animals on your farm and sell them profitable as food. If everything works well the animals will prosper and you can sell their offspring on the market. Your animals need your full attention. Take care of proper feeding, daily care of the stables, and even their well-being. Having so much to take care of you will sooner or later need help.

It is a widespread, but uncommon, species that breeds in the warmer parts of Europe (predominantly in central and eastern regions), across temperate Asia and Southern Africa. This is a shy and wary species, unlike the closely related White Stork. It is seen in pairs or small flocks\u2014in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. The Black Stork feeds on amphibians and insects.\nhe stork family contains several genera in three major groups: the open-billed and wood storks (Mycteria and Anastomus), the giant storks (Ephippiorhynchus, Jabiru and Leptoptilos), and the \"typical storks\", Ciconia. The typical storks include the White Stork and six other extant species, which are characterised by straight bills and mainly black and white plumage. Within the genus Ciconia, the Black Stork's closest relatives are the other European species, the White Stork and its former subspecies, the black-billed Oriental White Stork of east Asia.The Black Stork was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Ardea nigra. It was moved to the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson two years later. Both the genus and the specific names are Latin; Ciconia is \"stork\" and nigra is \"black\".Slightly smaller than the White Stork, the Black Stork is a large bird, 95 to 100 cm (37--39 in) in length with a 145--155 cm (5 ft) wingspan, and weighing around 3 kilograms (6.6 lb). They can stand as tall as 102 cm (40 in). Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck, and a long, straight, pointed beak. The plumage is all black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, axillaries and undertail coverts. During the summer, the Black Stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Greece in the south, with an outlying population in Spain and Portugal. They are nowhere abundant in these western parts of their distribution, but more densely inhabit the eastern Transcaucasus. A population of Black Stork is also resident in Southern Africa.The Black Stork is a strong migrant, wintering in tropical Africa and India. A broad-winged soaring bird, the Black Stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long distance flight, although are less dependent on them than the White Stork. Since thermals only form over land, storks, together with large raptors, must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points, and many Black Storks can be seen going through the Bosporus. They fly approximately 100 to 250 km a day with daily maxima up to 500 km.\nThe storks migrate from the middle of August to the end of September. They return in the middle of March. About 10 percent of the western storks choose the passage Sicily - Cap Bon, Tunisia. The common route goes over Gibraltar. Many birds are fly around the Sahara next to the coast. Most birds are wintering in the wetlands of Nigeria or Mali. The eastern birds take the route Bosphorus-Sinai-Nile to Africa. Birds that summer in Siberia winter in northern and northeastern India. In Southern Africa, The Black Stork builds a stick nest high in trees or on cliffs. It nests in Central Europe in April to May, and is a winter visitor to northern India, Nepal east to Myanmar.", "title": "Black Stork Ciconia nigra  flock Flight closeup video new Habitat in Maharastra", "publishedDate": "2013-03-13T12:08:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bD0iBDxtsk", "description": "Video #11\n\ni finished the world blarney2 :O", "title": "Growtopia: blarney level complete; ST.

Crumb's incendiary Angefood McSpade. Also investigated is the increased use of blacks in super-hero comic books as well as syndicated strips. Black Images in the Comics wraps up from the '80s to now, with the increased visibility of blacks, often in works actually produced by blacks, all the way to the South African strip Madam & Eve, Aaron McGruder's pointed daily The Boondocks, and more \u2014 including over a dozen new entries added to the out-of-print hardcover edition.\n\nEach strip, comic, or graphic novel is spotlighted via a compact but instructive 200-word essay and a representative illustration. The book is augmented by a context-setting introduction, an extensive source list and bibliography, and a foreword by Charles R. Johnson, the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship and winner of the National Book Award for his 1990 novel Middle Passage.\n\n\"The book presents a unique look at the evolution of comics, but it also proves comics to be an effective and sobering lens for viewing the history of racism toward blacks.\" -- School Library Journal\n\n\"As this small but potent book shows, African Americans didn't fare any better in the comics medium than elsewhere in popular culture. Str\u00f6mberg's compact cultural critique encapsulates each of about 100 black comics characters in a brief, single-page essay and a full-page illustration...\" -- Booklist", "title": "Black Images in the Comics (Softcover Ed.) by Fredrik Str\u00f6mberg - video preview", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T06:55:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bJchpHMQuM", "description": "Hannis Brown with Wes Reid, Lucas Dedmon, Matt Steckler, Jeff Hudgins, Fernando Arruda, and Melaena Cadiz.", "title": "Oh Ah Ee (live at Zebulon, Brooklyn, Nov 23rd, 2010)", "publishedDate": "2011-01-19T04:08:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bK0RfksJRA", "description": "Madeline tells about a billion stories from her childhood.

Over the years, the martini has become one of the best-known mixed alcoholic beverages. H. L. Mencken called the martini \"the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet\" and E. B. White called it \"the elixir of quietude\"\n\nPouring all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice cubes, the ingredients are mixed then strained and served \"straight up\" (without ice) in a chilled cocktail glass and garnished with either a green olive or a twist of lemon (a strip of the peel, usually squeezed or twisted to express volatile oils onto the surface of the drink).\n\nAlthough there are many variations, in modern practice the standard martini is a mix of gin coupled with dry vermouth usually in a five-to-one ratio. Shaker mixing is common due to influences of popular culture, notably the fictional spy James Bond, who always asked for his vodka martini to be \"shaken, not stirred\". However, stirring has a long history. Harry Craddock's Savoy Cocktail Book (1930) prescribes stirring for all its martini recipes.\n\nNoel Coward suggested that a perfect martini should be made by \"filling a glass with gin then waving it in the general direction of Italy\", meaning the less vermouth added to the gin the better the resulting drink. \n\nThe dryness of a martini refers to the amount of vermouth used in the drink, with a very dry martini having little or no Vermouth. Conversely, a wet martini has a significant amount of vermouth added.\n\nA dirty martini contains a splash of olive brine or olive juice\nThe exact origin of the martini is unclear. Numerous cocktails with names and ingredients similar to the modern-day martini were first seen in bartending guides of the late 19th century. One popular theory suggests it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez served at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco sometime in the early 1860s, which people frequented before taking an evening ferry to the nearby town of Martinez.\n\nAlternatively, the people of Martinez say the drink was first created by a bartender in their town.[6] Another theory links the first dry martini to the name of a bartender who concocted the drink at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912.\n\nBut it was Prohibition and the relative ease of illegal gin manufacture that led to the martini's rise as the predominant cocktail of the mid 20th century in the United States. With the repeal of Prohibition, and the ready availability of quality gin, the drink became progressively dryer. In the 1970s and 80s, the martini came to be seen as old-fashioned and was replaced by more intricate cocktails and wine spritzers, but the mid-1990s saw a resurgence in the drink and an explosion of new versions.\n\nSome newer drinks include the word \"martini\" or the suffix \"-tini\" in the name (e.g., appletini, peach martini, chocolate martini, espresso martini); however, these are simply named after the cocktail glass they share with the martini and do not share any ingredients in common, and therefore should not be considered variants of the martini.", "title": "WORLD'S BEST DRINKING TRICK", "publishedDate": "2012-01-28T19:08:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bZv_eWCvxQ", "description": "http://spinrewriter4.topxreviews.com Get Spin Rewriter 4.0 5 Day FREE Trial today.

We will be using Autodesk Inventor and iLogic to create a mini ERP system for Custom Cabinetmaking. The blogtorial will be quite long, and will cover a lot of ground relating not only to modeling, but how to automate things once the model is complete. This series will use Autodesk Inventor 2013 to create the models, but it is likely you will be able to follow along with Inventor 2012. Hope you enjoy the video and the tutorial that will follow.

'Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.' (Rom 10:1-2) It is not my goal to condemn the Jewish people, but to condemn the six-pointed star, a curse symbol. The hexagram star was mentioned and condemned by the God of Israel in Amos 5:26 and it was called by Him, `the star of your god, Moloch' or otherwise called `Chiun'. Reference was also made to the Israelites having it in the wilderness in Acts 7:43 by Stephen. Here it was called the Star of Remphan. All these names refer to the `god' Saturn. Now, the name SATURN in Chaldee is pronounced Satur; but, as every Chaldee scholar knows, consists only of four letters, thus -- Stur [ed. Star?]. This name contains exactly the Apocalyptic number.' (Hislop, p. 269) S = 060 T = 400 U = 006 R = 200: = 666 Now Saturn is also the sixth Planet from the Sun, has six letters and Saturn is associated with Satan which has a very similar spelling.http://www.av1611.org/nkjv.html", "title": "Second Pentacle of Solomon", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T23:03:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "9biuUFtwgjE", "description": "Thanks to these beautiful angels in our lives, who hide as normal humans among us...\n\nEnjoy, Immediate Music - Belle Vie\n\nDragonstarDT", "title": "Immediate Music - Belle Vie", "publishedDate": "2013-10-24T19:01:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9biwgyGr8l0", "description": "dos personalidades.", "title": "NENETS 033", "publishedDate": "2013-02-18T05:42:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bjFyITxw7c", "description": "", "title": "Merlyn \u0e41\u0e1f\u0e19\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T06:39:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bjLlHSWdyA", "description": "ViVA z Praszki \nObs\u0142uga r\u00f3\u017cnego rodzaju imprez okoliczno\u015bciowych. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/vivazespol\nKontakt: 667533146", "title": "Zesp\u00f3\u0142 ViVA - Hera koka hasz ( cover dance TYROS 4 ) 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T16:46:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bj_yQP_TNQ", "description": "CANAL DEL EDITOR : http://www.youtube.com/user/aLieeNz\nEspero que os guste el peque\u00f1o edit o mintage de el nuevo editor de Dimegio Si es asi LIKE Y FAV :)", "title": "Mintage\"THE UNIQUE\"#1 by ement", "publishedDate": "2012-05-07T13:35:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bjsag2vYlQ", "description": "Trailer for a US film, derived from a VHS source.\n\nDirector: Larry Cohen\nStarred: David Carradine, Michael Moriarty, Candy Clark\n\nAlternative title:\n* Q\n\nDVD: Released by Anchor Bay and Blue Underground.", "title": "Q: The Winged Serpent (1982) - Trailer", "publishedDate": "2009-05-18T04:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bk6QIlsZMg", "description": "Piri-piri airibenqui (en la etnia machiguenga)\nEn la Amazon\u00eda hay varias plantas de la fam. de las Ciper\u00e1ceas que llaman piri-piri con propiedades medicinales espec\u00edficas, al uso de las diferentes etnias amaz\u00f3nicas.

To find the slope of a line, students use the formula slope = rise over run.  Problems involve lines with positive slopes, negative slopes, slopes that must be reduced, slopes of 0 (horizontal lines), and \"no slopes\"(vertical lines). Students also learn that the variable \"m\" is used to represent the slope of a line.\n\nIn Algebra, we use the word \"slope\" to describe how steep a line is, and the slope of a line can be found using the ratio rise over run between any two points that are on that line.\n\nSince the slope of a line is a fraction, remember to reduce your slope if possible at the end of the problem.\n\nThe most common mistake made in problems involving the slope of a line is to mess up the sign.  To avoid this mistake, we use the following ideas:\n\n- The slope of a line that is going uphill from left to right is positive.\n\n- The slope of a line that is going downhill from left to right is negative.\n\nNote that the slope of a line that is horizontal (flat) is zero, and the slope of a line that is vertical (straight up and down) is 'no slope.'\n\nThe variable \"m\" is used to represent the slope of a line, so if the slope of a line is 2/3, then we say that m = 2/3.\n\nThe slope of a line is one of the first concepts that is introduced in the study of linear equations.", "title": "Slope of a Line - MathHelp.com - Algebra Help", "publishedDate": "2008-04-15T15:49:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bmFodExHjI", "description": "", "title": "Laconia Muskrats   Chris", "publishedDate": "2012-07-19T17:50:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bmRsFeM0Ro", "description": "Hey guys!

What I learned there was how to attract the publics attention, generate and, increase interest, and assimilate information.  All this I use as tools to describe, explain and deepen the interest in the sites that we visit. From my experience, I have learned that in this way, the Holy Land becomes more than just history, and that the large stones that we see scattered about in dissaray, join together one by one until they become - a Byzantine Church. This also happens when I lead a group of Pilgrims in the Steps of Jesus. We climb to the peak of Mount Precipice, \"glide\" over the land to the Sea of Galilee, land on the water and \"see\" the miracle which enfolds before us. This is a many faceted experience.

This new process will significantly reduce the time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives while those family members go through the immigrant visa process to become permanent residents.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR PROVISIONAL UNLAWFUL PRESENCE WAIVER\n\nIndividuals will be able to apply for a Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver starting March 4, 2013 if he/she meets the following eligibility criteria:\n(i) Is present in the United States at the time of filing the application for a provisional\nunlawful presence waiver and for biometrics collection;\n\n(ii) Upon departure, would be inadmissible only under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) of the Act\nat the time of the immigrant visa interview\n\n(NOTE: this section refers to the 3- and 10-year bars of inadmissibility for unlawful presence in excess of 180 days);\n\n(iii) Qualifies as an immediate relative under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act;\n\n(iv) Is the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative petition (Form I-130 or I-360);\n\n(v) Has a case pending with the Department of State based on the approved immediate\nrelative petition and has paid the immigrant visa processing fee as evidenced by a State\nDepartment Visa Processing Fee Receipt;\n\n(vi) Will depart from the United States to obtain the immediate relative immigrant visa;\nAnd\n\n(vii) Meets the requirements for a waiver provided in section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act,\nexcept the alien must show extreme hardship to his or her U.S. citizen spouse or parent.\n\nWHO IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PROVISIONAL UNLAWFUL PRESENCE WAIVER\n\nIt is important to note that the following individuals will be INELIGIBLE for the provisional unlawful presence waiver under the process:\n(i) USCIS has reason to believe that the alien may be subject to other grounds of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence;\n\n(ii) The alien is under the age of 17;\n(iii) The alien does not have a case pending with the Department of State, based on the\napproved immediate relative petition, and has not paid the immigrant visa processing fee;\n\n(iv) The Department of State initially acted to schedule the immigrant visa interview\nprior to January 3, 2013 for the approved immediate relative petition on which the provisional unlawful presence waiver is based, even if the interview has since been cancelled or rescheduled after January 3, 2013;\n\n(NOTE: The actual date and time that the alien is scheduled to appear for the interview is not relevant for the eligibility determination. This rule applies even if the alien failed to appear for his or her interview, cancelled the interview, or requested that the interview be rescheduled.)\n\n(v) The alien is in removal proceedings, unless the removal proceedings are\nadministratively closed and have not been recalendared at the time of filing the Form I-601A;\n\n(vi) The alien is subject to a final order of removal or a final order of exclusion or deportation;\n\n(vii) The alien is subject to reinstatement of a prior removal order; or\n\n(viii) The alien has a pending application with USCIS for lawful permanent resident status.", "title": "I-601A Provisional Waiver Lawyer: Who is Eligible New Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver process", "publishedDate": "2013-01-06T23:12:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bvym0XfjMw", "description": "Tested in thousands of student lab experiments, our well known Quantitative Centripetal Force Apparatus has proved its worth. Its simple concept and robust construction guarantee reliable lab success. A hanging mass and a counter-balance are attached to a horizontal bar mounted atop a vertical shaft about 45cm high, and the suspended mass is tied to the vertical shaft with a horizontal spring. When the shaft is spun, the suspended mass swings away. The displacement at any given speed is marked by a vertical mounted pointer that can be moved laterally to match the pointed tip of the suspended mass.\n\nFrom the mass, the speed of rotation and the radius, one can quickly calculate the centripetal force. Using the included weight hanger and ball-bearing pulley, you can measure the force required under static conditions to displace the mass the same distance against the pull of the spring. Spring and mass are dimensioned to ensure a rotational speed slow enough to be safe and easily counted. The vertical shaft rests in a ball-bearing mount that minimizes wobble and friction. \n\nhttp://www.cencophysics.com/quantitative-centripetal-force-apparatus-cenco/p/IG0037934/", "title": "Quantitative Centripetal Force Demonstration", "publishedDate": "2008-01-10T20:20:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bwQ6M52n4c", "description": "{Joe}\n\nShe just sat there gripping the stupid necklace as if we not a useless piece of metal, but a survival kit. I had dozens made just like it, openly handing them to my longtime bed buddies who had the privilege of passing the two week mark.\n\nMonths ago, it would've hurt me - ripped me apart even - to see Demi crying like that, but now as I lay watching, I was completely unaffected.\n\nIt wasn't my fault she ditched me two months ago to go on a retarded business trip. With her gone, what was I supposed to do? \n\nSo I visited a bar, one thing led to another, and pretty soon I realized that I missed the thrill of my old life, one where I was completely unattached. I missed partying, and sleeping with a new girl every night. After a while, the same old thing gets tedious.\n\nI continued to lay with one eye open, staring at her tear-streaked, makeup-less face. She was too busy crying to notice I was awake, what a selfish bitch. \n\nSure, she was my wife and I was supposed to care for her and all that good stuff, but she had shed so many tears these past two months that another few drops probably wouldn't matter anyway.\n\nOf course, I hadn't actually talked to her in more than a month, since we got past the yelling and shrieking stage, so I wouldn't actually know for sure. Not that I cared.\n\nBut her idiotic, and not to mention disturbing dying cat sobs have made me realize what she truly is, a pathetic little weakling.\n\n{Demi}\n\nThat night, as usual, I cried myself to sleep. And only when my body was sick with exhaustion, did I fall asleep. But even in a state of subconsciousness, my mind continued to revolve around Joe.\n\nA dream of Joe and I formed in my mind, a distant memory of a once-perfect relationship. It was my 18th birthday, the day he had given me my prized possession, the necklace. \n\nI was busy enthusiastically stuffing in my face with the picnic food Joe had packed, when he stepped behind me and carefully brushed several strands of my dark espresso-colored hair aside. He then proceeded to slip a locket around my neck.\n\nA ray of sunshine hit the sparkling heart-shaped metal, casting a healthy glow on my neck. It was gorgeous.\n\nI was continuously running my fingers over it when I felt carvings. I glanced down curiously and noticed the word, \"Joe.\" It was simple, yet so heartfelt.\n\n\"What's this?\" I questioned, my lips upturning in a delighted grin.\n\nBringing his lips to my already rumpled hair, he whispered, \"It's my heart. It will always be right in that necklace, belonging to you. Forever and always.\" I could feel my heart skip several beats, just listening to his fairytale words.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, my dream shifted. From marvelous to a nightmare, in just a few seconds. \n\nHe entered the threshold of our room the next morning. \"Where were you last night?\" I demanded, my voice wavering between worried and furious.\n\n\"None of your business,\" he retorted simply.\n\n\"I'm your wife, for goodness sake. I just want to know where you were last night, is that too much to ask?\" I questioned, annoyance hastily replacing the other clashing emotions.\n\nWhat he answered, however, was the exact opposite of what I had expected. I expected denial, reassurance, that my wonderful dreamy husband loved me, and only me. But what I got was honesty.\n\n\"I was out with another girl,\" he responded easily, brushing me off as if I were nothing more than a measly piece of lint. His answer stunned me into muteness, and I was unable to say anything more even as he exited the room calmly. \n\n.\n\nI got a truly amazing response on my last episode, so I'm hoping to get the same on this one. \n\n10+ comments for the next one.", "title": "Stolen - 2", "publishedDate": "2011-06-25T03:01:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bx6dYKfzEA", "description": "la bagarre entre deux m\u00e2les pour s\u00e9duire la femelle !", "title": "combat grand t\u00e9tras", "publishedDate": "2009-05-26T07:40:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bxeM0WiIzw", "description": "\u0633\u0627\u0645\u064a \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 - \u064a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0642 \nworry ends - sami yousef", "title": "worry ends - sami yousef", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T19:27:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9bxw40vtrIs", "description": "Video e registrazione Tato Strino", "title": "Eleonora Strino - Old Folks", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T12:20:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9by24n5d-N0", "description": "A short video of several agitprop posters and their manufacturing in the former Soviet Union.", "title": "Soviet Propaganda", "publishedDate": "2007-05-29T20:27:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9by2nkwd6WM", "description": "You can now join Oryx's Awakening!\nGo to this link.

Find this and many more recipes with pictures on the Giallozafferano App (in English) http://itunes.apple.com/app/giallozafferano-recipes/id384387249?mt=8\n\n+++\n\nWelcome to the GialloZafferano kitchen! I'm Sonia and today we'll be preparing a classic pasta dish from the Lazio region: Spaghetti alla Carbonara. Let's look at the ingredients we'll be using:\n\u2022 Four egg yolks + 1 egg\n\u2022 100 g/a half cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese\n\u2022 150g/5.5 oz of diced guanciale or a good quality smoky bacon\n\u2022 320g/12 oz of spaghetti\n\u2022 Two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil\n\u2022 Freshly ground black pepper\nOK. Let's see how it's done.\nThe first thing you'll need to do is to boil your spaghetti in lightly salted water at a steady boil. Keep the salt low because both the meat and the pecorino cheese are already quite salty. The next step is to saut\u00e9 the guanciale in a thin layer of olive oil. Once the guanciale is golden and crispy, take it off of the heat and leave it to cool for a few minutes.\nIn a bowl, I've put the four egg yolks plus the whole egg. Now, whisk them together until completely mixed. Add the grated Pecorino, mix it in well, and after add the black pepper. If the sauce seems to be too dense, you can thin it by adding some of the water from the pasta a little bit at a time. Here we are. Now add the guanciale which has, by this time, cooled a little. Mix everything together, and with that, the sauce is ready.\nIt's time to drain the pasta. When you drain, leave the pasta a little moist -- don't get rid of all of the water. This will help to thin out the sauce so it coats all the pasta. Now, mix it together, and once the pasta's coated, serve it right away.\nHere's our lovely Spaghetti alla Carbonara.

Plants were not only a food source, but were used in medicines, building, clothing, weapons, and as food containers.\n\nThe k\u0101huna were skilled in utilizing the plants around them for medicines and religious ceremonies.  The ti plant was used to reduce fevers, while the ginger root was mashed and mixed with salt water for a purification mixture.  k\u014d (sugar cane) juice helped make medicines more palatable.\n\nEarly Hawaiians used koa wood for building canoes and surfboards, and the wauke for pounding into tapa cloth.  Leaves of the ahuhu were crushed and put in tide pools where it made fish an easy prey by immobilizing them.\n\nThis garden highlights many of the plants utilized by ancient Hawaiians and has individual markers telling the specific uses.  A row of ti plants separates the edible from the non edible plant sections. The small medicinal garden is planted under and around 2 Milo trees.\n\nAs you enter this collection from the upper road you'll see an 'ulu (breadfruit) tree, and beyond it are tall, flowering ko (sugar cane) plants surrounding three fenced kalo (taro) plantings. Hawaiian varieties of mai'a (banana) are planted near the kalo beds, and beyond them are two 'ohi'a 'ai (mountain apple) trees from the South Pacific which fruit twice a year. The ground covers under the sugar cane are varieties of 'uala (sweet potato). These can be recognized by their flowers which resemble miniature morning glories which are closely related.\n\nOur named varieties of 'uala are being grown the traditional way a bit further up the Valley- the tubers grow in loamy soil in low rock cylinders. You can see these by the edge of the grass near the banyan tree.\n\nAfter walking past the kalo beds you'll see a row of ti plants separating the edible from the non-edible plant sections. A  medicinal garden is planted under and around two milo trees, hibiscus relatives with excellent wood brought by the Polynesians. Across the trail in the non-edible section are two calabash trees. These along with the Kona orange tree in the food section did not get to Hawai`i until after western contact. The thin-shelled calabash fruit, about 6\" in diameter, surprisingly grow right from the bar of the tree. Calabash's gourd-like fruits were used as bowls and made into musical instruments. In this same area is the only type of bamboo early Hawaiians used and the favorite loulu palm species used for thatching.", "title": "Waimea Valley Trail Hiking Programs, Hawaii Botanical, Archeological and History Hikes", "publishedDate": "2011-02-25T08:08:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9cDS24WsSOw", "description": "A new segment in which I learn and spread the knowledge of new vocabulary.

Videos posted online by a well-organized insurgent group operating in the country's north show the missile in action. These are first serious US-built arms used in the civil war.\n\nAs Reuters reports, such weapons in hands of the rebel group signals \"a further internationalization of the conflict, with new rockets suspected from Russia and drones from Iran also spotted in the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\"None of that equipment, however, is seen as enough to turn the tide of battle in a now broadly stalemated war, with Assad dominant in Syria's central cities and along the Mediterranean coast and the rebels in the interior north and east.\n\n\"It was not possible to independently verify the authenticity of the videos or the supplier of the BGM-71 TOW anti-tank rockets shown in the videos. Some analysts suggested they might have been provided by another state such as Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, probably with Washington's acquiescence.\n\n\"U.S. officials declined to discuss the rockets, which appeared in Syria around the same time Reuters reported that Washington had decided to proceed with plans to increase aid, including delivery of lower-level weaponry.\n\n\"U.S. officials say privately there remain clear limits to American backing for the insurgency, given the widely dominant role played by Islamist militants.

In the next five seconds I'm about hear a word that I've never hear before but will have a profound impact on my life. I was about to learn that the blotchiness on my hands was vitiligo.\n\nI was given a pamphlet full of technical terms and, as I flipped through the pamphlet, my doctor was echoing some of these very same terms. None of this mattered to me at the moment. All I was concerned about was when will my skin look like every other human I know instead of this creepy, sub-human looking skin that I have now?\n\nJust tell me if there's a cure for vitiligo. That simple statement doesn't equate to a simple answer. It seems that the answer is: kind of.\n\nThere are a variety of creams that will treat the affected skin area. These creams are called corticosteroids and they work by treating the inflammation of the skin. Experts say that tissue inflammation is a key ingredient in the flare ups of vitiligo.\n\nThrough my own research I've learned about a new cream, phenytoin, which sounds very promising. Apparently, the de-pigmentation of the skin is the result of the skin cells dying prematurely. These skin cells are called melaocytes and when they die the skin loses its pigmentation. That's where phenytoin comes in. Phenytoin tries to prevent the destruction of the melaocytes. It's still in the research stage but I like what I read about it.\n\nA person's diet can influence vitiligo too, according to experts. I need to determine if I have any food allergies because those allergies can cause an outbreak of the skin disease. The first step is a thorough examination of my food intake. Unlike other times where you are examining your calorie intake, this examination only deals with the exact foods you are eating. After that, you can make an appointment with an allergy specialist to determine if you have any allergies to the foods. If you find that you do have any allergies to foods that you eat regularly then you need to find a substitute or eliminate them completely. This can help to eliminate any further outbreaks of vitiligo. However, I'm not sure that's guaranteed though, but it's worth a try.\n\nAs you can see, modern science is still dealing with this disease and its cure. In the meantime, I will do the best I can to live with the small outbreak I have. Hopefully, I can reduce this outbreak and prevent any new outbreaks.", "title": "Just Tell Me If There's a Cure for Vitiligo", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T17:40:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9cuFIYtn7ZU", "description": "", "title": "Deployment Marine Harvest Ireland 100603", "publishedDate": "2010-11-15T21:56:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9cukBJdt25M", "description": "Buttermilk Junction Old-Time String Band\u2122 playing the old-time tune \"Crooked Stovepipe,\" a reel in G major, in the 1872 Marine Creek one-room schoolhouse at the Log Cabin Village living-history museum in Fort Worth, Texas on Saturday afternoon, March 16, 2013.", "title": "The Crooked Stovepipe", "publishedDate": "2013-03-17T03:26:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9cumeNgjaNw", "description": "", "title": "2011 11 06 cso issoire   club 1 gp   adeline reichen   quassia de la barre", "publishedDate": "2011-11-11T19:50:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9cuwQMQ-GUA", "description": "Check that the level on your engine's dipstick is at least halfway...

The body of the world-famous Iron Lady was then taken in polished ceremony to one of London's foremost landmarks, where the farewell services of national heroes Nelson, Wellington and Churchill were conducted.\n\nGuests at St Paul's Cathedral included eleven Prime Ministers among the 2,000 mourners paying their last respects at the foot of the Union Jack flag.\n\nThe coffin was driven to St Clement Danes for a short service. Eight members of the armed forces then took the coffin back out and onto a gun carriage, which was accompanied by honour guards from units which saw action in the Falklands War.\n\nThe Royal Marines Portsmouth band played Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Chopin.\n\nThe procession marched at 70 paces per minute from Westminster, which has been the seat of the government for almost a thousand years, to \"The City\" (London's business district), which can be said to have benefited in no small part from Thatcher's 1986 removal of many restrictions.\n\nThatcher's immediate successor, Conservative John Major, and Tony Blair, who ousted him as Prime Minister as the head of New Labour, were on neutral ground in St Paul's, with today's leader, the Tory, David Cameron.\n\nThe Lord Mayor ushered in Her Majesty, the Mourning Sword held high. Queen Elizabeth II has not attended a former Prime Minister's funeral since Sir Winston Churchill's, in 1965. \n\nThe Queen is around six months younger than Thatcher was when she died of a stroke ten days ago at the Ritz Hotel, aged 87.\n\nThe coffin was carried in through the cathedral's western entrance. Thatcher's grandchildren Amanda and Michael walked in front of it.\n\nMusic included British composers Elgar, Purcell and Vaughan Williams.\n\nRichard Chartres, the Bishop of London, helped put things into perspective: \"After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm. The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure, even an -ism. But today, the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service. Lying here, she is one of us.\"\n\nA private cremation ceremony was held later.\n\n\nThatcher's quotable quotes\n \n==\n\"I don't think there will be a woman prime minister in my lifetime.\" - as Education Secretary in 1973, six years before becoming Britain's first, and so far only, woman prime minister\n\"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.

And where there is despair, may we bring hope.\" -- Quoting St Francis of Assisi after her 1979 election victory \n\"I am not a consensus politician. I'm a conviction politician.\"  - 1979\n \"I don't mind how much my ministers talk, as long as they do what I say.\"  - 1980\n\"We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands.

Once you apply you'll receive a $40 discount coupon toward the purchase of a converter box.\n\nStep 3:\nPurchase the converter box.

Avoid scorching hot baths or showers\n\nExtremely hot water can actually lead to your skin losing moisture as the lipid barriers in the skin are broken down. Instead of using hot water, use lukewarm water. For the face, baths obviously aren't that big a problem. If you simply can't go without that hot shower in winter though, try to limit it to a few minutes instead of half an hour.\n\nOnce you're done, apply your moisturizing cream as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Avoid using drying soaps\n\nWhen washing your face, do not use regular soap. Use a gentle, moisturizing soap or face wash that will not strip the natural oils from your skin.\n\nThe following beauty tips for dry skin pertain to topical skin care.\n\n3. Use both a day and night cream\n\nWhile the use of a day cream goes without saying, the importance of a night cream is often overlooked. You're not out in the sun, you're just lying in bed. No problem, right?\n\nWrong. Using a night cream rich in natural moisturizing oils and emollients will help your skin to stay hydrated throughout the night. Avocado oil and shea butter are excellent natural moisturizers that closely resemble your skin's natural oils.  These oils all make for a perfect moisturizer for dry skin.\n\nSince your body also repairs itself while you sleep, the extra nutrients a quality night cream provides can aid your skin during this natural repair process.\n\n4. Increase the levels of hyaluronic acid\n\nHyaluronic acid (HA) is found naturally in our bodies. For the skin, HA plays a major role in the hydration of the skin. It can absorb many times its own weight in water, not only hydrating your skin, but also increasing its volume. This helps to give a smoother appearance to the skin.\n\nYou can raise the levels of HA in your skin naturally by using skin care that contains an ingredient like Phytessence Wakame. This inhibits the enzyme hyaluronidase, which breaks down HA in the skin. In doing so, more HA becomes naturally available in your skin.\n\n5. Use a hydrating mask\n\nA specially formulated hydrating mask will deeply hydrate and repair your skin. Typically you'll only need to use this type of mask once every two weeks.\n\nBe sure to apply these beauty tips for dry skin in your day to day skin care regime, and you should notice a clear improvement in your skin condition.\nhttp://youtu.be/9d3_FgmrExg\n http://EzineArticles.com/2584150\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/YoutupediaGER", "title": "5 Beauty Tips For Dry Skin   How to Fight Dry Facial Skin", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T08:06:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9d3llsrs7tc", "description": "Watch how the lift-the-flaps in this book help tell the story of the trials and joys of friendship.

Created by Joseph Richardson, a stonemason and musician, it took almost thirteen years to collect and shape enough individual notes of hornfels to make an eight-octave range. The massive task of assembling this instrument consumed Joseph so absolutely that he and his family were reduced to poverty. Once complete, Richardson and his sons toured Europe as The Rock, Bell and Steel Band, and even performed at Buckingham Palace, by command of Queen Victoria. The Stones are a permanent exhibit at the Keswick Museum and Art gallery, who very kindly agreed to let us record this rare instrument. The Stones were painstakingly transported to Music Farm Studios, Cumbria, where two different sets of mallets were used to laboriously capture large sets of velocity hits, then an extra articulation was recorded -- the sound of the head of the wooden mallet being scraped across the stone surface -- a surprisingly haunting and resonant sound.+INFO: +INFO: http://sh.st/fZZt", "title": "Skiddaw Stones KONTAKT", "publishedDate": "2014-01-25T08:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9dDyJo8V0Do", "description": "http://www.kortexmed.de/\nGezeigt wird eine Manipulation des Schulterg\u00fcrtels nach dorsal.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "Best Flower In Kolkata Flower Show", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T17:39:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9dNQ9lSucBw", "description": "Write on comments what next aqw video tutorial i should do next\n\nThis is an old video on my old account:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqBYkOzxD6Eh2NDeFRDi-9Q ( Mike lilskilled )\n\nDrops\n\nAxe of Holocene - Member\nMagma Armor - Member\nVulcan's Might - Member\nHot Head Helm - Non Member\nDacite Daggers - Non Member\nRed Hot Flamberge - Non Member\n\nCharacter Pages\nMike571 - http://www.aq.com/aw-character.asp?id=Mike571\nChaos Guardian - http://www.aq.com/aw-character.asp?id=Chaos+Guardian\nSkilled Ninja - http://www.aq.com/aw-character.asp?id=Skilled+Ninja", "title": "AQW - How to get to Mafic Dragon", "publishedDate": "2014-06-08T04:20:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9dNRRRP56BU", "description": "This is a (very) short video showing the starter pull cord spring and container on a Homelite weed whacker.", "title": "Homelite Weed Whacker Starter Pull Cord Spring and Container (cord retract/rewind)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-27T14:04:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9dNbarBQJZs", "description": "My first gaming upload!

This album that will be launched in both Korean and Chinese was expressed as Korean class and Chinese class, fitting the concept of 'school', and it is thus expected to be of high interest for both its music and the album itself. \nThe title song 'Wolf' is a collaboration of dubstep and hip hop, and is highlighted by wild and powerful beats and sounds. The lyrics are also interesting as it talks about a lone wolf that lived in a cave finally feeling love after meeting a

The source of a useful Castor Oil medicine and a highly valuable industrial lubricant with specialised properties. DO NOT TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN MEDICINAL CASTOR OIL. It needs to be made specially so the poison part gets left behind. Yes the whole plant is slightly poisonous and the seeds are highly poisonous to humans and some other animals (fatal dose for a chicken is something like 70 seeds, yet even chooks grazing in Summer in semi-arid desert-like conditions, will pick and peck around the seeds, but know not to eat even a single one. A VERY USEFUL plant as a \"nurse-plant\" in areas with hot summers, like Perth where it can be used to provide partial shade to vegetables during mid-summer period. A great pioneer plant for degraded soils, and for temporary shelter, soil anti-erosion cover or hedges etc. Grows on sandy soil or hard-packed heavy clays. I cannot recommend this plany highly enough, when planted IN THE RIGHT PLACE. Be sensible DO NOT PLANT this in places like gardens where young children may find and eat the seeds (eg child-care centres). Warning, a single seed might be fatal for a child and 3 seeds fatal for an adult (under some circumstances). Can only tolerate a hint of frost. I have grown these outside in Christchurch New Zealand, mostly they die every winter, but during some mild winters they can survive outside. Chance of surviving winter increased by planting up close against a warm concrete wall. Here is a video I have uploaded of one that has survived at the factory I work at, in a frost-prone Western suburb of Christchurch, NZ, which has survived 3 \"once in 30-year\" snowfalls over the last 3 winters. This coming summer I intend to give it some fertiliser and lots of water (water is free here) and see just how large I can get it to grow ! It is sheltering and protecting through winter the edible cape gooseberry (Physalis edulis/peruviana) growing underneath it.

At the minim you need to take a grip that is a little bit narrower than shoulder width to no more than your hands being 8-to-14 inches apart.\n\nClose grip bench press are based on the same concept of diamond pushups or close grip push-ups where the main focus is on your triceps and making your triceps muscle much bigger.\n\nRemember than your triceps represent 2/3 of your total arm size so it make send to include close grip bench presses for bigger triceps instead of focusing more on curls for your biceps which although may look impressive do not account for the majority of the arm size found in your muscles. \n\nTip: try doing one and one fourth close grip bench presses where you lower the bar to your chest and push it all the way back up but you only come down a fourth or half way down and then all the back up again and then you go all the way down for one rep or one and one forth or half rep. doing one and one fourth close grip bench presses will give you a more intense triceps workout.\n\nBest to do close grip bench presses with heavier weights for sets of 6-to-12 to really make your triceps get bigger\n\n**************************************\nMore tips & exercises for bigger triceps  \nHow I got 19 inch arms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tds7Wt9ltI\n\nDips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFkZwsSlYIw\n\nWeighted bench dips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_SOZ8MZzLQ\n\nHow to get bigger arms: http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-get-bigger-arms-muscles-fast.htm\n\n**************************************\nMore tips & exercises for a bigger chest...\nHow to get a bigger chest: http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-get-a-bigger-chest-fast.htm\n\nHow to bench press for bigger chest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjmH_e5AqxI\n\n***************************************\nMore Muscle Tips...\n26 Tips to build muscle faster: http://www.nowloss.com/fast-muscle-building-tips.htm\n\nHow to build muscle fast with paper & scissors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8fwrIp-tuM\n\nFast Muscle Building Techniques: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5qWKDYV54nF1yVU4sj4x9o3dFsQNm2Qc\n\n**************************************\nI'm Adrian Bryant & I'm the guy who created NowLoss.com to help you look good naked.

(Radio Corporation of America ((now Thomson CSF)) was the parent of NBC).\n\nCBS which had competed with it's own colour system (sequential, colorwheel) developed by the CBS Laborotories in Stamford CT by Dr. Peter Goldmark was second and ABC which had no organically developed system was 3rd to adopt.

The simple sport of throwing a knife is fun. And no sound is more satisfying then a thrown knife as it \"thunks\" and sticks a wooden target. Whether you're skilled at knife throwing or are just starting out, you know there's also no fun in missing the target.\n\nOne solution is the Shuriken or throwing star. Used for centuries in China and Japan, it consists of no more than a flat piece of steel with 3 or more points. If you throw it overhand like a baseball, side arm, underarm or back hand like a flying saucer, it hits on at least one point every time.\n\nOur Sure Strikes aren't like the cheap, shoddy throwing stars you see at flea markets, guns shows, and in martial arts magazines. That's because they are laser cut from high carbon steel that's been heat treated to a hard spring temper before sharpening and then given a black, baked-on epoxy finish to protect them from the elements.\n\nAll three share the same sized diameter, but are varied in weight class due to the differences in steel thickness among the three models. Maximize your fun and get all three sizes!

The music is by John Kander with lyrics by Fred Ebb and a book by Ebb and Bob Fosse. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration of criminal justice, and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\". The musical is based on a 1926 play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins about actual criminals and crimes she reported on.\n\nABOUT this song:   \nThe song Razzle Dazzle is from the broadway musical, 'Chicago.'  The original Broadway production opened June 3, 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre and ran for 936 performances. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. Chicago's 1996 Broadway revival holds the record for the longest-running musical revival on Broadway (not counting the revue Oh! Calcutta!) and is Broadway's sixth longest-running show. As of January 12, 2010, it has played for more than 5,400 performances. The revival was followed by a production on London's West End theatre and several tours and international productions. An Academy Award-winning film version of the musical was released in 2002, directed by Rob Marshall and starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifah.\n\nThe musical Chicago is based on a play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of murderesses Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of Roxie Hart, was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,[2] murder of Harry Kalstedt. The Tribune reported that Annan played the foxtrot record \"Hula Lou\" over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\". She was found \"not guilty\" on May 25, 1924. Velma is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Gaertner was acquitted on June 6, 1924. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in Chicago, \"Billy Flynn\".[citation needed]\n\nWatkins' sensational columns documenting these trials proved so popular that she decided to write a play based on them. The show received both popular and critical acclaim and even made it to Broadway in 1926, running for 172 performances. Cecil B. DeMille produced a silent film version, Chicago (1927),starring former Mack Sennett bathing beauty Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as Roxie Hart (1942) starring Ginger Rogers, but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, Gwen Verdon read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined. In her later years, Watkins had become a born-again Christian and believed her play glamorized a scandalous way of living.[2] However upon her death in 1969, her estate sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon and Fosse.[2] John Kander and Fred Ebb began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional vaudeville number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, with Fosse also directing and doing the choreography.\n\nLYRICS:\nGive 'em the old razzle dazzle\n Razzle dazzle 'em\nGive 'em an act with lots of flash in it \nAnd the reaction will be passionate\nGive 'em the old hocus pocus \nBead and feather 'em\nHow can they see with sequins in their eyes? \nWhat if your hinges all are rusting? \nWhat if, in fact, you're just disgusting? \nRazzle dazzle 'em \nAnd they'll never catch wise\nGive 'em the old razzle dazzle \nRazzle dazzle 'em\nBack in the days of old Methusulah \nEveryone loves the big bamboozulah\nGive 'em the old three ring circus \nStun and stagger 'em\nWhen you're in trouble Go into your dance\nThough you are stiffer than a girder \nThey let you get away with murder\nRazzle dazzle 'em And you got a romance\nGive 'em the old razzle dazzle \nRazzle dazzle 'em\nGive 'em an act that's unassailable \nThey'll wait a year till you're available\nGive 'em the old wobble bammy \nDaze and dizzy 'em\nShow 'em the first rate sorcere you are \nLong as you keep 'em way off balance \nHow can they spot you got no talents?\nRazzle dazzle 'em \nRazzle dazzle 'em \nAnd they'll make you a star", "title": "Shirley Bassey - Razzle Dazzle", "publishedDate": "2010-08-02T12:41:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9e7b0imq3_o", "description": "Smart Distance Pro is the extended set of Smart Tools collection (distance, golf-rangefinder, speed).\n\nThis range-finder(telemeter) measures the Distance to a target by the camera perspective. The effective distance is 10m-1km. To measure the distance, you should know the height(width) of a target.\n\nDon't worry!! Man's height is 1.7m(5.6ft), a golf flag is 7ft, a bus is 3.2m(10.5ft), a door is 2.1m(7ft). With that, we can guess the height(width) of almost everything.\nIf you know the airplane model, you can measure the distance from the sky. For reference, Boeing 747's width is 72 meters.\n\nUsage is simple. Input the height of the target, and touch the screen.

By 2009, all U.S. regions report at least 15% resistance, with several regions exceeding 25%. Susceptibility of P. mirabilis to major antibiotics (tetracyclines excluded) remains high. However, strains producing enzymes that confer antibiotic resistance are becoming more frequent in North America and Europe. The emergence of these particular enzymes is cause for concern because they produce resistance to sulfonamides (seen here), beta-lactams (such as ampicillin), and other first-line therapies for UTIs.\n\nThe sample consists of 218,749 outpatient isolates tested for trimethoprim-sulfa resistance.

Over 80 international experts gathered in Brussels for two days to discuss recent industry developments, ongoing regulatory challenges and the latest scientific data.\n\nParticipants agreed that good progress is being made to address the current challenges the industry is facing in areas such as competitiveness and the sustainable use of additives. A strong value-chain was perceived as the key to overcome any future obstacles. At the same time, there is still a continuous need to communicate about flexible PVC applications \"finding the right message for each audience\" as mentioned by Gerflor's R&D and Engineering Director, Dr. Olivier Ceysson.\n\nRegarding the plasticisers market, the new ECPI manager, Dr. Stephane Content, highlighted that \"the most obvious trend in Europe is the decrease of low molecular weight phthalate consumption while we see a consistent increase of demand for high phthalates. In parallel, we also see a slight increase for other types of plasticisers\". In that respect, IHS Director Helen Weeks presented growth estimates forecasting that Europe is expected to retain its net export position in the flexible PVC market.\n\nThe progress made by the European PVC industry sustainable development program, VinylPlus, was shared at the conference highlighting the importance to find a compromise between recycling and use of legacy additives.  Other presentations covered topics such as the selection of the right plasticiser, the regulatory landscape affecting the industry in Europe and the relevance of lifecycle analysis related to \nrecycling. \n\nThe second day of the conference was dedicated to scientific presentations on a number of topics from indoor environment to human and environmental monitoring.  Shima Dobel, from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, offered an overview of her country's ongoing phthalate strategy explaining that \"science is not about yes or no, it is not black or white. Industry and regulatory authorities have to try to read science with each other's eyes\".", "title": "Plasticisers Conference -  December 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T15:34:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eEBy8hxiek", "description": "Hyperhidrosis Guide:\nhttp://www.sweaty-palms.com\n\nHyperhidrosis is defined as an excessive and non physiological amount of sweat produced by the body.

He has built a trellis and the vines are crawling all over it. The vines grow very fast. You can notice the difference by the hour. When the Loofah plants have grown more, they will have two different kinds of flowers. The female flower is large.  The male flower comes in clusters of flowers. As these Loofah are grown inside, Geezer will have to pollinate with a Q Tip. The plants were born on June 5th.

Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, and featuring judges Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Lopez, and Keith Urban, along with in-house mentor Randy Jackson, the series empowers contestants and viewers to share their voices in deciding who will be America's next singing superstar. \n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of hopefuls from across the nation audition for a shot at stardom. The show's judges will travel across the country including stops in Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Boston, MA; Detroit, MI; Omaha, NE, Salt Lake City, UT; and San Francisco, CA, in search of the next AMERICAN IDOL. They narrow down the competitors to a select group of semifinalists who sing their hearts out each week in front of a studio audience and television viewers.\n \nThe judges have their say after every performance, but it's the viewing public that determines who will advance to become a finalist and who will go home. Telephone, text message and online voting begin immediately after each live performance show, and the results are announced during the following night's live broadcast. \n\nEventually the competition is whittled down to two finalists who compete for a major recording contract with 19 Recordings and the AMERICAN IDOL title. Past winners Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery Phillip Phillips, and Candice Glover, as well as fan-favorites Jennifer Hudson, Adam Lambert, Chris Daughtry, and Katharine McPhee, have all become household names and made their marks on the recording industry.\n\nWe're Just Getting Started - AMERICAN IDOL XIV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/americanidol", "title": "We're Just Getting Started - AMERICAN IDOL XIV", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T03:01:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eNW-XTJeTQ", "description": "www.lonestarartisans.com\nCustom jewelry box made for a client out of 52,000-year-old wood called Ancient Kauri.

Because traditional medications use preservatives, fillers, binders, dilutants and dies to which many people are sensitive. \n\nOften times, debilitating drug side effects can be attributed to the action of the drug itself! In many cases these side effects are severe enough to cause people to stop taking their medications! \n\nCustom compounded prescriptions offer an excellent alternative.\n\nThe reason?\n\nCustom compounded medications eliminate the irritants that cause much of the sensitivity, thereby alleviating aggravating allergies, which in turn can improve compliance and provide patients with better overall results.\n\nAnother benefit of custom compounding is that \"alternative methods of delivery\" of a medication can be created according to a patient's specific needs. \n\nFor example, patients who may experience difficulty swallowing can often times have their medications incorporated into a topical cream.\n\nOne of the most common examples of alternative delivery of medications pertains to pain and anti-inflammatory drugs. Kohana Pharmacy \"compounds\" (mixes) common drugs used for the treatment of pain/inflammation into its proprietary \"base\" cream (Genesis Plus) for topical application. \n\nMost patients who are taking narcotics, or are using non-steroid anti-inflammatory to manage their pain benefit greatly from topical pain creams. These creams not only provide therapeutic relief of \npain but have the added advantage of virtually eliminating debilitating side effects such as clouded sensorium, (mental confusion), foggy brain, or the very common, \"room to room forgetfulness.\" \n\nTopical pain creams are applied directly to the site of pain. This allows the medication to work right at the painful area(s) to eliminate the pain without causing typical narcotic side effects.\n\nKohana topical pain creams require a prescription.

The series centres around two children, Simon Randall, played by Spencer Banks, and Liz Skinner, played by Cheryl Burfield, who discover the existence of a strange anomaly known as the 'Time Barrier', which enables them to travel in time to different historical periods in alternate pasts and futures. The two children have contrasting personalities; whereas Simon is studious, Liz is something of a tomboy, and this often leads to conflict between the two. However, as the series progresses, their antagonism matures into a deep bond of friendship.\n\nThe main theme of the programme is concerned with the way mankind uses, and abuses, science and technology. This series explores how the pursuit of scientific knowledge and advancement can lead to the depersonalisation of individuals and the abandonment of moral principles. A secondary theme (explored in the instances where Liz and Simon encounter potential future versions of themselves) concerns the extent to which an individual can change according to the situations encountered in his or her life.\n\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeslip", "title": "Timeslip Introduction Clip", "publishedDate": "2014-01-16T13:45:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9eOxkU1K4XE", "description": "The Chairman returns to Raw to make a momentous Survivor Series announcement.\n\nSEE FULL RAW results from this show with videos \u2013\n http://bit.ly/raw1013   \n\nMore ACTION on WWE NETWORK : http://bit.ly/1u4pM74\n\nDon't forget to SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/1i64OdT", "title": "Mr. McMahon makes a surprise appearance: Raw, Nov. 3, 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T02:06:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9ePSkQsSFJA", "description": "Same as the other MK video, but with Buffered Rendering OFF.

Reproduction is either accomplished by binary fission (asexual), conjugation (sexual)[3], or (rarely) by endomixis, a process involving total nuclear reorganization of individual organisms.[2] During binary fission a fully grown organism divides into two daughter cells.[3] Conjugation consists of the temporary union of 2 organisms and the exchange of micro-nuclear elements[3]. Without the rejuvenating effects of conjugation a paramecium ages and dies.[3] Only opposite mating types, or genetically compatible organisms, can unite in conjugation.[3]\n \nParamecium caudatum can communicate with neighbors using a non-molecular method, probably photons.[5] The cell populations were separated either with glass allowing photon transmission from 340 nm to longer waves, or quartz being transmittable from 150 nm, i.e. from UVlight to longer waves. Energy uptake, cell division rate and growth correlation were influenced.
