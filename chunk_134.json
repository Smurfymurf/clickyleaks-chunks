Due to the changing state of affairs in foreign policy and reforms of the army, the document had to be edited.\n\nIgor Korotchenko, chief editor of National Defense\n\n\"Obviously, in the new version of the Russian military doctrine, abstract diplomatic formulations will be changed to more stringent and clear definitions of what is really a threat to Russia. Neither NATO, nor the EU and the United States will be considered as partner organizations. The threats that they pose - of military and economic character  - will be defined very clearly, openly, and without a restrained  diplomatic approach.\n\n\"I think that in light of the events in Ukraine, Russia's military doctrine will be altered to understand that color revolution, as a tool to manipulate people and political processes, will also be categorized as in a separate group of real threats, including the use of media resources for shattering and destroying the existing system of government. On the basis of new technologies, there are attempts being made to manipulate public and political consciousness, to impose opposition groups funded from outside. I think that this phenomenon will be described in detail and assigned to new categories of threats, including NATO's eastward expansion, the emergence of new army bases and new infrastructure that can be used during the war against Russia.", "title": "Russia's new military doctrine will clearly outline major threats", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T18:02:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7S1yhSp5jaI", "description": "The official trailer for Jonathan Glazer's much anticipated new film starring Scarlett Johansson.

A ban on menthol is expected before the new rules are finalised, as well as those particularly attractive to children, such as vanilla.\n\nAnother issue is parliament's demand that e-cigarettes can be sold with refillable nicotine cartridges. Many member states want single-use items. \n\nSome governments, including Britain and Germany, are concerned that at the nicotine concentration level of 20 milligrams per millilitre being discussed, one 10 ml refill cartridge would contain more nicotine than a carton of 200 cigarettes.\n\n\nFind us on:\n     Youtube http://bit.ly/zr3upY\n     Facebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\n     Twitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Is the electronic cigarette market about to go up in smoke?", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T10:20:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7S5hNNNHTb0", "description": "100 % truth concerning the bible, gmstothepoint, gmsrapidfire, gmsbholdicomequickly, gmsonthego, Yahawah baha sham Yahawashi, compassion mercy very pitiful save in time of affliction, sirach ecclesiasticus 2:10-11, isaiah 33:22 kjv, gmslosangeles, gms", "title": "Ecclesiasticus 2:10-11 (precept) Isaiah 33:22 (kjv)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T20:03:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7S5roWz-ZiY", "description": "Custom Bubble Wall Waterfall by Midwest Tropical Custom Water Features http://www.midwest-tropical.com installed at the resorption of a state of the art medical spa in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nIf you are interested in any design build Bubble Walls, Bubble Panels, Water Walls or similar Custom Water Features please call Midwest Tropical at (800) 775-6764, email info@midwest-tropical.com or visit http://www.midwest-tropical.com/custo...\n\n\nUtilizing computer controls and sophisticated LED lighting the bubbles and lights are choreographed to create a beautiful effect which can be customized to any size or application.\n\nMidwest Tropical invented the bubble wall and is the world leader on building large scale bubble walls and water features for resorts, casinos, cruise ships, restaurants, nightclubs, hospitals, and other venues around the world.\n\n\nWater feature design, fabrication & installation: Midwest Tropical Inc.\nwww.midwest-tropical.com", "title": "Custom Bubble Wall Water Feature-Scottsdale, Arizona", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T03:01:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7S65u0mE5Q0", "description": "Four Black-necked Stilts engaging in courtship display in a salt pond in southern Honduras.

It comes in a variety of colors, some very bright. They are very hardy corals that do not require intense lighting nor water flow.\nIt is a solitary, semi-aggressive coral with shorter tentacles than its cousin the Long Tentacle Plate Coral (Heliofungia sp.). Even with short tentacles, it can still damage other corals that it comes in contact with. With placement in the aquarium, keep in mind that it will often inflate itself with water and expand to twice its size. It will do best on the bottom of a reef aquarium, preferably lying on a fine sandy substrate. The Short Tentacle Plate Coral is easy to maintain in the reef aquarium and makes an excellent candidate for the beginner reef aquarist. Care should be taken in handling it however, to prevent damage. It requires moderate lighting combined with moderate water movement within the aquarium. For continued good health, it will also require the addition of calcium, strontium, and other trace elements to the water.\n\nIt is ideal to feed Plate Corals a few times per week with brine or mysis shrimp, and small chopped meaty foods.

Kinsella, Phil Alden Robinson\nFilm Description: \"If you build it, he will come.\" That's the ethereal message that inspires Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) to construct a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield. At first, \"he\" seems to be the ghost of disgraced ballplayer Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), who materializes on the ballfield and plays a few games with the awestruck Ray. But as the weeks go by, Ray receives several other messages from a disembodied voice, one of which is \"Ease his pain.\" He realizes that his ballfield has been divinely ordained to give a second chance to people who have sacrificed certain valuable aspects of their lives. One of these folks is Salingeresque writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), whom Ray kidnaps and takes to a ball game and then to his farm. Another is Doc Graham (Burt Lancaster), a beloved general practitioner who gave up a burgeoning baseball career in favor of medicine. The final \"second-chancer\" turns out to be much closer to Ray. That \"magical\" field in Dyersville, Iowa still draws thousands of baseball-happy tourists each year.\n\n\"field of dreams\",\"field of dreams clip\",\"field of dreams trailer\",\"field of dreams 2\",\"kevin costner\",\"james earl jones\",\"amy madigan\",\"gaby hoffmann\",\"timothy busfield\",\"phil alden robinson\",\"sports dramas\",\"ages 11-12\",baseball,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"family drama\",\"sports stories\",\"lloyd levin\",\"brian e frankish\",\"choice videos\",\"faith videos\",\"hope videos\",\"perseverance videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++17120,/m/06j8q_,/m/0127m7,/m/0f6_x,/m/0660zg,/m/05cxlb", "title": "Field of Dreams (5/9) Movie CLIP - People Will Come (1989) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:56:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SB6BIbQMNk", "description": "No Assists\nwww.dzs-clan.de\n\nSteering Wheel: Logitech G27", "title": "F1 2013 Hotlap Bahrain 1:30.8 + Setup  Gameplay", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04T10:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SBnk3lKzzg", "description": "To Zlatan is to embrace your fears and take the risks necessary to overcome them. #DareToZlatan", "title": "Nike Football: Dare To Zlatan - Fear Nothing 2/3", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T13:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SByR1urk-0", "description": "El enigm\u00e1tico sistema bancario mexicano contempor\u00e1neo\nAutores: Fausto Hern\u00e1ndez y Alejandro Villag\u00f3mez\n\nEditorial Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias\n2013", "title": "Alejandro Villag\u00f3mez presenta el libro \"El enigm\u00e1tico sistema bancario mexicano contempor\u00e1neo\"", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T16:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SCFx09HF60", "description": "", "title": "How-To Treat Whiteheads With Benzoyl Peroxide", "publishedDate": "2014-07-10T18:09:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SCO-GTWXAk", "description": "Loucura Labial S\u00e3o Paulo x Flamengo", "title": "Loucura Labial S\u00e3o Paulo x Flamengo", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T22:46:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SCQi853WnE", "description": "Jonny flyr norrut l\u00e4ngs norska kusten, tillsammans med alla som blivit utslagna i Idol...och Hunger Games.

The narration is as follows:\n\nIn human anatomy, the subtalar joint is also known as the Talocalcaneal joint, in the foot.  This articulation is between the talus and the calcaneus at the posterior, middle, and anterior facets and is capable of both pronation and supination, about a single axis model.  This motion exists primarily as transverse and frontal plane motions, depicted in the series shown.\n\nIn the medial and lateral viewpoints, this motion of pronation and supination will lower and raise the arch height of the foot, respectively.  This will be accompanied by change in the talocalcaneal angle which increases and decreases, as well.  As the medial column flattens, the talonavicular articulation will fault, with the talar head declining plantarly, splaying of the foot will also result in changes in overall length.\n\nAnterior and Posterior views will demonstrate an internal and external rotation of the leg, which translates in frontal plane inversion and eversion of the heel respectively.  This subtalar pronation, unlocks the midtarsal joint and in return, creates a mobile and adaptable posture to the foot architecture.\n\nThere will also be a notable widening and narrowing of the foot shape, visible in the dorsal and plantar viewpoints of this simulation.  Here, the Talocalcaneal angle will also demonstrate widening in pronation, while the talar head escapes its articulation with the navicular.\n\nThe subtalar joint is the primary interface of pronatory and supinatory motions of the foot and leg.  The human foot is a remarkable instrument of human locomotion, and is an intriguing accomplishment of engineering.\n\n\u00a9 2012 DrGlass.org\nNarrator: Caroline Murphy\nIllustrations: Nicholas Giovinco & Kevin Kirby\nProducer: Nicholas Giovinco", "title": "Over Pronation & Supination Motion Biomechanics of the Subtalar Joint Explained", "publishedDate": "2012-06-14T02:56:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SKdteHWHWQ", "description": "Le CS Sedan Ardennes, qui a su mobilis\u00e9 ses fans sur la page facebook Coupe de France, a remport\u00e9 le jeu concours sur l'op\u00e9ration \"Match de r\u00eave\" 2014.

Psychological Impact of Infertility.Parenthood is one of the major transitions in adult life for both men and women. The stress of the non-fulfillment of a wish for a child has been associated with emotional sequelae such as anger, depression, anxiety, marital problems, sexual dysfunction, and social isolation. Couples experience stigma, sense of loss, and diminished self-esteem in the setting of their infertility (Nachtigall 1992). In general, in infertile couples women show higher levels of distress than their male partners (Wright 1991; Greil 1988); however, men's responses to infertility closely approximates the intensity of women's responses when infertility is attributed to a male factor (Nachtigall 1992).

That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"jack nicholson\",\"faye dunaway\",\"bruce glover\",\"joe mantell\",\"nandu hinds\",\"roman polanski\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"gender videos\",\"regret videos\",\"office videos\",sophie,\"jj gittes\",duffy,\"evelyn mulwray\",walsh,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/04md4j,/m/04yn0y,/m/09fb5,/m/0hwbd", "title": "Chinatown (1/9) Movie CLIP - Screwing Like a Chinaman (1974) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T23:09:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SZ_mWvSlhI", "description": "This full grown male nilgai (bluebull) was seen on December 28, 2009, afternoon.

around looking for belongings to steal.\n\nThe 68-year-old woke up during the burglary - but rather than being intimidated, she chased the thief away with her walking stick.\n\nReid, 51, escaped

Does she scream for help?\n\n'No, Margaret, who cannot move easily at speed, gets up quickly from her chair and, stick aloft, chased him from her home.'\n\nBlog : http://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com/\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews", "title": "U.K Police Hidden Camera : Burglar who broke into a pensioner's home FIVE TIMES was caught", "publishedDate": "2013-12-09T18:06:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SbOYXQ2x6I", "description": "Buy at  http://www.laserexact.nl.

The only thing she said that she was eating berries and drank water from rivers.'\n\nNikolayev said the rescuers guided by the dog spotted traces of her bare feet and this helped them find her. \n'We began searches, thinking that if she had lost her shoes she would try and stay away from the deep forest, because there are a lot of sharp sticks there,' he said. \nSuddenly with the dog's help 'we saw Karina siting in the grass', he said. \n'We rushed to her, got her a little tea and grabbed her to run back to the car and doctors.'\n\nNikolayev said: 'I carried Karina myself to the car, and she was light as a bird.\n'She weighed hardly ten kilograms - but amazingly she was fully conscious.'\nEkaterina Andreeva, a psychologist with the rescue team, said: 'We can say that the girl's mind was not hurt. \nShe is talking, she reacts normally to everything around her.\n'She recalls what happened to her.'\nAmazingly she suffered no major physical injury though she has scratches on her feet. \nShe had been badly bitten by mosquitoes and other insects.\nThe taiga is home to Russia's largest populations of brown bear, moose, wolf, red fox and reindeer.\nIt is one of the most extensive natural forests left in the world.", "title": "The Moment girl is Rescued After Spending 11 Days in Wilderness", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T10:01:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Se9vwjgNDw", "description": "At a recent ACS panel discussion on \"The Constitution in 2020,\" Walter Dellinger discussed the ongoing debate over \"originalism\" as a method of constitutional interpretation.", "title": "Former Acting Solicitor General Walter E.

Adding to the thrill of the ride is the suspension of riders beneath the track, feet flying free. The ride is not for the faint hearted.\n\nFor the less brave why not try Diamond Devil Run, the runaway mine train ride, or the Bushwacker, the smallest coaster in the park.\n\nThere are a number of water rides including Monkey Falls which has one of the highest drops in the world and the rapid river ride, Crocodile Gorge where you are guaranteed to get wet, very wet.\n\nThen there is the Slingshot, an ultimate thrill ride, which  combines elements from skydiving and bungee-jumping. Flying three abreast, riders are strapped into a full body harness and hoisted 10 storeys to the top of the tower. Pulling their own rip cord, riders plunge in a 30m free fall towards the ground before swinging upwards in a 180 degree arc and then straight down again.\n\nThe white-knuckle thrills and spills are just one element of Ratanga Junction. The other attractions are designed to entertain children, families, and those who prefer to take their thrills in more manageable doses. \n\nVisitors can also enjoy a variety of live entertainment and eat at one of the many eateries around the beautifully landscaped park.\n\nRatanga Junction also offers a large and unique variety of opportunities for functions and can host almost any function you can dream of from 60 - 7000 guests. \n\nIf you're looking for a great place to spend the whole day with friends, colleagues or family this is the place to be! \n\n\nRatanga Junction -- The Wildest Place in Africa", "title": "Ratanga Junction Theme Park Cape Town South Africa - Africa Travel Channel", "publishedDate": "2012-11-01T10:04:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SeRQgTZR-o", "description": "TABS at http://www.mashandflutter.com\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mashandflutter\n\nGuitarist of Mash and Flutter demonstrates and explains some of his favorite Slash licks.

In July 1977, he had his first major hit, \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\", a song written by his brother Barry, just as his first album Flowing Rivers broke into the US Top 20, on its way to selling over a million copies. The album's second single \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\" broke in early 1978 amidst the commercial explosion caused by his brothers' contributions to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, replacing \"Stayin' Alive\" at the top of the US charts, and then surpassed by \"Night Fever\" when it reached the summit in mid-March. Continuing the momentum of his first successes, Gibb began work with the Gibb-Galuten-Richardson production team on his second album Shadow Dancing, which was released in April 1978. The title track, written by all four Gibb brothers, was released as a single in the US in April 1978, and in mid-June began a seven week run at number one, achieving platinum status. Two further Top Ten singles, \"An Everlasting Love\" (which reached number five) and \"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away\" (which reached number nine), a song also released by his brothers (in 1979), were extracted from the album, which became another million seller.", "title": "Our Love Don't Throw it All Away     Andy Gibb", "publishedDate": "2009-07-09T00:48:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Sq9ROgXo3Q", "description": "http://derek360.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/why-im-not-atheist-part-1-meaningless.html", "title": "why I'm not an atheist part 1: Meaninglessness", "publishedDate": "2012-07-01T20:10:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SrKqjkCte8", "description": "0 to 60 92 corolla 8 sec. two people in car no launch.", "title": "Corolla 0 to 100 ( 4age 20v silvertop)", "publishedDate": "2008-03-25T03:35:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SrMBLGRStY", "description": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430.\u0414\u043d\u0438 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.", "title": "Panorama Restoranindan salyut", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T13:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SrOCqWTs6U", "description": "", "title": "Burglar Bill story", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T12:45:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SrQwtnwU88", "description": "The title says it all along with these sweggy trickshoots.\neditor: http://www.youtube.de/matxedits\n\n\nsub er die", "title": "THB Mists: Rejoined THB!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T22:59:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7SrTWM9joJ4", "description": "Video by Dr. Kent Hamra, Transposagen collaborator\nTRANSPOSAGEN'S PROPRIETARY SPERMATOGONIAL STEM CELL (SSC) TECHNOLOGY\nSpermatozoa are produced from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) through the developmental processes\ncalled spermatogenesis.

Genetically modified SSCs are then used to produce knockout and transgenic rats.\n\nAll rats are treated according to IACUC regulations. First the rete testis/efferent dutules is exposed by creating a small tear abive and below the rete. A steril twisted kim wipe wick is inserted underneath in order to prop up the rete. The rete is then soaked with sterile saline to keep moist and prevent tissue damage. A small tear is then created in the tube containing the efferent ductules that go into the rete. A capillary injection needle is inserted following the efferent ductles into the rete testis. A gentle and shallow puncture is created in the rete testis followed by slow injection of SSCs. Proper injection will fill the seminiferous tubules. The rete testis is like a central terminal where all the seminiferous tubules attach.

New Hampshire's second-largest city has twice been named \"Money' magazine's \"Best Place to Live in America,\" and is the only city in the country ever to win this honor twice. A low crime rate also recently found Nashua ranked as the 27th safest city in the entire United States. Low unemployment coupled with excellent schools and up-to-date healthcare facilities were all reasons cited for this ranking in 1987 and 1997. These and many other great features make this city of 83,000 an excellent community in which to live and work.\n\nThe village of Nashua was an early textile center. By 1836, Nashua Corporation had built three cotton mills and was producing 9.3 million yards of cotton cloth annually on 710 looms. The city of Nashua was chartered in 1852, and before the Civil War, railroad lines crossed the city with 56 trains entering and departing daily. After World War 11, the textile mills moved south and the city gradually developed a diversified industry, particularly high technology and retail.\n\nSince a commercial development boom in the 1980's, the city has served as a shopping mecca with several malls and plazas for those fleeing Massachusetts sales taxes. Not to be outdone, downtown Nashua hosts several seasonal festivals and parties, a myriad of activities from evening concerts at Greeley Park to parades and shows all over the city. Ethnic restaurants and posh specialty gift shops have made the downtown area a popular destination year-round, in addition to an extensive retail industry; the city also hosts several major high-tech companies such as Compaq Computer Corporation, Oracle, and Sanders, a Lockheed-Martin Company.\n\nRecreation is not overlooked in this small city, and there are ample outlets for many different activities. Mine Falls Park, a 300-acre area in the geographic center of the city, offers trails for hiking, running, biking, and cross-country skiing. Athletic fields are also available for soccer and baseball. Greeley Park, a 126-acre tract between Concord and Manchester Streets, offers a playground, tennis courts, an outdoor band shell for summer concerts, and picnic facilities.\n\nThe city is also home to one of two New Hampshire professional baseball teams, the Nashua Pride. In 1998, the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball brought the unaffiliated Nashua Pride to Holman Stadium. Future Brooklyn Dodger stars Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe played at Holman in 1946 on the first integrated baseball team in the U.S. Holman Stadium is also host for numerous high school and youth sports events, as well as for the annual July 4 fireworks display, always among the area's largest.\n\nHistory is alive in Nashua with an active historical society and several buildings which have been named to the National Register of Historic Places. The Hunt Memorial Building, once the city library is a brick Gothic structure and the only New Hampshire example of the work of architect Ralph Adams Cram.\n\nThe Nashua Public Library hosts community activities including lectures, club meetings, free movies, and concerts. With New Hampshire's second-largest collection of materials, the library circulates more items than any other library north of Boston.\n\nEducation is a priority for Nashua residents, and the 12 elementary schools, three junior high schools, and the high school reflect this focus, preparing graduates to go on to fine colleges anywhere. Still, many choose to pursue higher education locally in of the areas several fine colleges and vocational schools.\n\nHousing in Nashua is diverse, with a wide array of options from single-family homes to rentals and condominiums. The elegant North End has been Nashua's most affluent area for more than a century. Well-kept Victorian homes built around the turn of the century line the edge of Concord Street near Greeley Park. The older textile mills along the Nashua River have been renovated into condominiums, popular for their proximity to downtown's Main Street. Spit Brook Road in south Nashua is home to many condominium developments, and is conveniently located close to Route 3.

Dividing by zero is described as undefined.\n\nBut, in fact, few functions are truly undefined when the denominator is zero; that's when we use the \"limit\" idea. You know, the limit of such and such as the denominator approaches a neighborhood of zero.\n\nWell, since we are dealing with an image, we know that the image is not undefined when the angle requires division by a trig function of value zero. But, a lot of programmers don't have the patience and/or knowledge to know what the real condition is at \"divide by zero,\" so they just plug in something that works to keep the program from crashing.\n\nIn this case it resulted in the \"billowing smoke\" we saw facing us (180 or zero degrees) getting less billowing as we rotated around the image of the towers, finally becoming as flat as the side of the tower when 90 degrees was hit and COS(90) equaled 0. The program didnt crash, just the official lie.\n\nThe \"real\" smoke on the south side of wtc1 always shoots out from the wall, no matter what angle we view it from.\n\nThe fake smoke subject to trig functions on the north side forgets to billow when we see it from 90 degrees!\n\nHow is this a smoking gun?\n\nThe billowing smoke coming from the north face stopped billowing.\n\nFortunately, as the \"chopper\" did not stay long at the perpendicular position and the COS of the angle of the view stopped being zero, the north face smoke grew ever more billowy as required in the RFP.\n\nSo, I have some advice for the budding graphic/digital artists out there...\n\nDon't quit math!\n\nmurtagh, lin and cellini may be verified at\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.01.html\ntranscripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.01.html", "title": "The Real 911 Smoking Gun; trigonometry error proves TV Fakery and faked televised 9-11 WTC smoke", "publishedDate": "2008-08-29T04:37:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7T6dkgsR47w", "description": "", "title": "Nepotul meu Darko hotarit sa-i scot dinti care se misca- feb. 2013.", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T07:00:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7T70jreBaoY", "description": "\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430 Nikko Skin Dive", "title": "\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430 Nikko Skin Dive", "publishedDate": "2012-08-14T14:56:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7T7DRCRCiuQ", "description": "Filmmaker and Actor Julie Delpy talked to Birds Eye View about being a woman filmmaker and her new film Two Days in Paris.\n\nBirds Eye View celebrates international women filmmakers.\nhttp://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk", "title": "Julie Delpy: Birds Eye View Interview", "publishedDate": "2007-08-30T13:34:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7T7lpE57Iaw", "description": "Please help me identify this tune.

It is a proven fact that the industrial performance of new flotation technology represents a major step forward in metallurgical efficiency.\n\n Emulsion polyacrylamide is one kind if high efficiency liquid flocculants with high concentration, polymerized in the oil by using water-in-oil emulsion advanced technology and W/O emulsifier. It has may characters, such as high conversion rate, high molecular weight, high stability, multi-function, instanct, etc. As a paper rention agent, it is widely used in making culture paper, mewsprint paper and cardboard paper, etc, with high effective contents, fast dissolving, low dosage, doubled efficiency than any other water-in-water emulsion. As a water treatment chemical, it is widely used in municipal sewage treatment, papermaking watertreatment, dyeing watertreatment, coal washing and so on.\n\n In a simplistic view, the conerstone of the emerging new flotation technology is the fineness of air bubbles. In contrast with the mechanically agitated cells new technology may be termed collectively as 'microbubble flotation'.\n\n Predicted results of \"ideal\" performance still vary considerably. The tree procedure should be reviewed and other measures of performance may be researched and developed.\n\n The next stage of development, to maturity, involves effective integration into the preparation plant. Compatibility with other processes, such as reagent effects,plementary contribution to overall plant performance, impact on operating practices/effectiveness and other effects not yet evident will have to be understood. Wear and tear will need to be assessed much more accurately.\n\n The mechanisms for the bubble-particle attachment is veryplex and consists of three steps, collision, attachment and detachment. The collision is achieved by particles being within the collision tube of a bubble and this is affected by the velocity of the bubble and radius of the bubble. The collision tube corresponds to the region in which a particle will collide with the bubble, with the perimeter of the collision tube corresponding to the grazing trajectory.", "title": "coal flotation process", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T15:41:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TWn2E8ZU8E", "description": "Tami was about to give it to Evelyn in Dulce,Dulche,Dolche whatever the name is!

This is another Text 2 Audio transformation using Flite. Below is the transcript for the recording:\n\nArgon is a chemical element with symbol\u00a0Ar and atomic number\u00a018. It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas. Argon is the third most common gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.93% , making it approximately 23.8 times as abundant as the next most common atmospheric gas, carbon dioxide , and more than 500 times as abundant as the next most common noble gas, neon . Nearly all of this argon is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas. The name \"argon\" is derived from the Greek word \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, neuter singular form of \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 meaning \"lazy\" or \"inactive\", as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete octet in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058\u00a0K is a defining fixed point in the International Temperature Scale of 1990. Argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas also has uses in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and other types of gas discharge tubes.

Because of this, most tenants will focus on the obvious,  leaving the entire lease agreement basically untouched.  Even with a few concessions given in this scenario, this is a huge win for the landlord because he retains all the \"gotcha\" clauses, cost-increase triggers, and oppressive language in the lease document.\nThe Lease Document is a Landlord Document\nA lease is usually a private document created by attorneys to minimize liability for the landlord and pass as much on to the tenant as humanly possible.  This document is far from neutral and must be amended to protect the tenant from oppressive and unfair restrictions that could potentially kill a business.\nLandlords Hire Experts\nLandlord brokers are full-time industry professionals who have an average of 10-15 years experience in commercial real estate in the Houston market.  These brokers advise the landlord many times on the asking rental rate and have a personal stake in keeping deals within the parameters they have stated they can achieve for the landlord.  Getting \"standard\" leases signed and asking rates for properties is always the goal.  Too many concessions could hurt there standing with the landlord and will not come easy.  Landlord brokers consistently outperform tenants because they have the homefield advantage and play a game where they know all the rules. Without help,  a tenant just does not have the time, access to information, or expertise to maximize concessions.  We average hundreds of emails, hours, and elbow grease grinding out a deal for clients and we know what we are doing.  If you are spending less than that AND your not an industry expert, you're leaving money on the negotiation table.  Don't worry though, the landlord broker's job is to make you feel GREAT about signing that \"standard\" lease agreement.\nThe Landlord Has a Strategy\nLandlords have experts advising them on how to market, price the building, structure a lease agreement, seek financing, etc.  These professionals provide a framework which protects the landlord by creating a set of non-negotiable standards the landlord will not deviate from. Remember, every deal has to be profitable in order to be a good deal for the landlord.\n\nPhone: (832) 493-3377\nEmail: JR@AssuranceCommercial.net\nhttp://www.AssuranceCommercial.net", "title": "Houston Office-Industrial Space: Why Landlords Broker Outperform Tenants Assurance Commercial", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T18:55:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TkoDVloEe0", "description": "La page Officielle Du Groupe Ultras Red Rebels\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Ultras.Red.Rebels\nSite Web : WWW.URR2961.COM", "title": "Red Rebels \"Album DIFFIDATI\": PISTE 4 - \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0629", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T15:20:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TktLRv1a_0", "description": "Matthew Ashford speaks out about Retinoblastoma and how early detection saved his daughter's life.

Note that the elbows are supported during the entire exercise which prevents them from being prematurely exposed to the stresses of high level ring strength elements while still allowing the shoulder girdle to begin developing maltese specific strength.\n\nNMBP may be performed on two springs boards as demonstrated in the video, two benches, two panel mats or even two boxes.  If you are unable to perform a free-standing stable shoulder stand as demonstrated by the athlete in the video, you may want to consider setting your station up next to a wall to prevent yourself from falling over.\n\nTo perform NMBP assume a shoulder stand on two spring boards.  The arms will be flat on the boards and pressing down strongly.  Maintain a strong degree of scapular protraction at all times.  At no time should the back be allowed to arch or the scapula to retract.\n\nSLOWLY lower to the ground, pause briefly and then return back to the shoulder stand for the next repetition.  To adjust the intensity of NMBP you may also utilize a tuck or straddle in addition to the straight body position demonstrated.\n\nFor beginners, I recommend 2 to 3 sets of 2 to 3 reps.\n\nFurther professional training advice as well as thousands of in-depth discussions regarding this type of conditioning are available at:\nhttp://GymnasticBodies.com/forum", "title": "Learn How to Use Gymnastics Rings - Negative Maltese Board Presses", "publishedDate": "2012-05-15T16:29:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TvDEOK7ZN8", "description": "Water Powered Copper Armillary Sphere\nhttp://www.dreamsprayer.com/", "title": "Dream Sprayer Earth Rings Copper Art Sprinkler", "publishedDate": "2008-05-05T13:46:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TvjZ8E4hcE", "description": "LEIAM A DESCRICAO E NAO ESQUECAM DO LIKE =]\n\nSalve pessoal, td bem por aih?

Ambitious, expansive but brilliantly cohesive, \"Stick By This\" joins the dots between Booka Shade's melodic electronica (\"Falling\"), Leftfield's dub techno (\"I'm Running\"), the classic musicality of MJ Cole (\"Lost In You\") and warm Laurent Garnier-esque techno (\"Need You Back\").\n\nAdding further colour to the album's spectrum, the album's first single - \"Lost In You\" - is a deep, bass-driven piano house anthem that features the soulful vocals of Janai and has gained props from US house godfather Tony Humphries and UK bass talent Toddla T -- the latter supporting the track BBC Radio 1.\n\nFinding fans at opposite ends of the dance music spectrum is nothing new for the Dusky duo. Previously existing as progressive/ melodic house entity Solarity, Dusky are London based musicians Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman. As comfortable writing elegant orchestral pieces or stirring piano motifs as they are jackin' garage house and epic techno grooves, their diverse sounds are united by the duo's singular aim -- to compose electronic music with depth, soul and originality.\n\nInfluenced by everything from classical and jazz to techno, UK bass and avant-garde electronica, their compositions have been supported by DJs as diverse as Dubfire, Sasha, Vincenzo, Shur-I-Khan, Motorcitysoul and Above & Beyond.\n\nOne of 2011's most exciting debut albums, \"Stick By This\" looks set to extend their appeal further yet.\n\nFollow Anjunadeep:\nWebsite: http://www.anjunadeep.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/Anjunadeep\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/deep-google\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep", "title": "Dusky - Grain", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T11:10:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7TzyPuakgaI", "description": "IF THATS YA NIGGA THAT TRIP TO COXSACKIE IS NOTHING ...\nCoxsackie correctional facility\nFREE K.O.

As Japanese insurance companies engaged in Yen repatriation to cover expected the costs of insurance benefits, G7 ministers and central bankers announced their intention to keep the Yen from going too high. In order to maintain orderly foreign exchange markets these agencies announced the intention of currency market intervention. As is often the case the mere threat of invention often turns the Forex market. Although Yen repatriation certainly continues it appears to be happening without driving the Yen to further highs. How to trade Forex successfully depends upon understanding what drives currency prices. Thus, a little insight into Yen repatriation is in order. What is happening is that much of the Yen carry trade has been done by Japanese unwilling to put their money in Japanese bank accounts where interest rates are nil. Thus these folks have bought US treasuries or other foreign debt instruments in order to gain a higher rate of interest. Now, when they need to bring assets home these investors need to sell offshore assets and convert their dollars, Euros, Swiss francs, and British pounds back into Yen. The buying pressure on the Yen has driven the price up.\n\nThe problem for Japan with a higher priced Yen is that Japan is an export driven economy. If the Yen is expensive so are Japanese products. High priced Japanese products could make them less competitive with similar products made in other countries. Thus Japan's economy would suffer from a stronger Yen. Also, for those trying to bring assets back home, a stronger Yen makes their offshore assets less valuable. This has always been the risk of the Yen carry trade. So long as currency rates remain reasonably stable it is easy to bring assets back home to Japan. When the Yen raises greatly in value the investor may lose more money in the exchange rate change than he has gained in several years of holding offshore debt instruments. How to trade Forex today with the Yen versus any other currency is to be aware of the issue of Yen repatriation.\n\nThere are, as always, other factors other than Yen repatriation that drive the currency markets today. One is outright war in Libya as well as political unrest in several countries in North Africa and the Middle East. These events tend to drive investors to safe haven currencies. We typically see the dollar as a safe haven currency along with the Yen and Swiss franc. The problem for the dollar today is that much of the Yen repatriation or Japanese asset repatriation is coming out of T Bills and the US dollar. As such the dollar may fall in value even as some investors move to it as a safe haven. As usual we are not suggesting that Forex traders buy or sell Yen, dollars, or any other currency. The point of this discussion is to highlight the factors that tend to drive currency prices and to encourage readers to understand the fundamentals of the currencies that they trade and the technical factors that drive market sentiment.", "title": "Yen Repatriation", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T12:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7U0XJ6i0F00", "description": "It was an honor play at Carnegie Hall in NYC.

We basically just drove around all day looking for people who were panhandling on the side of the road, we'd chat for a bit, if we felt like we should continue with the trick, we would, and then we'd leave them with the $100. \n\nEver since getting into magic, I wanted to learn some cool money tricks. I thought it would be cool do a video about it, but I didn't know how I would go about that. I tried a bunch of different tricks, and this one, just felt right. I was nervous because every time I did the trick, it would cost me $100. I did the trick 10 times! Although I knew it was for a good cause, I still wanted to make sure it worked. The people we had in the video were all very grateful for what we gave them. We made sure to talk to them a little beforehand and make sure they really needed it and would be able to use it for good things.

The series is about an intelligent robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a pre-teen boy, Nobita Nobi (\u91ce\u6bd4 \u306e\u3073\u592a Nobi Nobita?).\nThe series first appeared in December 1969, when it was published simultaneously in six different magazines. In total, 1,344 stories were created in the original series, which are published by Shogakukan under the Tent\u014dmushi (\u3066\u3093\u3068\u3046\u866b?) manga brand, extending to forty-five volumes. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. American media mogul Ted Turner bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release,[1] but canceled it without explanation before any episodes were aired. However, Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006 (the 26th film in the franchise) got a private screening in Washington, D.C. in November 2008.\nA majority of Doraemon episodes are comedies with lessons regarding values such as honesty, perseverance, courage, family and respect for elders. Various environmental issues are often visited, including homeless animals, global warming, endangered  of Japan are often covered.\nDoraemon was awarded the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for excellence in 1973. Doraemon was awarded the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982,[2] and the first Osamu Tezuka Culture Award in 1997. In March 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon as the nation's first \"anime ambassador.\"[3] Ministry spokesman explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries to understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture.\"[4] The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. In 2002, the anime character was acclaimed as an \"Asian Hero\" in a special feature survey conducted by Time Asia magazine.[5]\n\u2022 The name \"Doraemon\" can be translated roughly to 'shreya bayari' Unusually, the name \"Doraemon\" (\u30c9\u30e9\u3048\u3082\u3093?) is written in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana (\u30c9\u30e9) and Hiragana (\u3048\u3082\u3093). \"Dora\" is from \"dora neko\" (brazen or stray cat, \u3069\u3089\u732b), and is a corruption of nora (stray). \"Emon\" \u885b\u9580\u3001\u53f3\u885b\u9580 is a component of male given names, such as Goemon, though no longer as popular as in the past. \"Dora\" is not from dora \u9285\u947c meaning gong, but due to the homophony, the series puns on this, with Doraemon loving dorayaki.Doraemon is sent back in time by a young boy named Sewashi Nobi to improve the circumstances of his great grandfather, Nobita so that his descendants may enjoy a better future. In the original time-line, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of poor marks and grades, physical disasters, and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he set up which leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi sent him an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon.", "title": "Watch Doraemon New Song 2013 HD", "publishedDate": "2013-05-08T18:56:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7U973I0PcnY", "description": "DJcityTV's \"Cutting Room\" returns stateside for a new episode featuring Kansas City-based DJs B-Stee, Cutswell, Nick Fury, and Highnoone.\n\nSubscribe to DJcityTV: http://bit.ly/127fT8P\n\nB-Stee: http://www.twitter.com/djbstee\nCutswell: http://www.twitter.com/djcutswell\nNick Fury: http://www.facebook.com/nick.winfrey\nHighnoone: http://www.twitter.com/djhighnoone\n\nFollow DJcity:\nhttp://www.djcity.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/djcitycom\nhttp://www.instagram.com/djcity\nhttp://www.twitter.com/djcity\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/djcity\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/djcity\nhttp://www.youtube.com/tvdjcity", "title": "Cutting Room x Kansas City: B-Stee, Cutswell, Nick Fury, Highnoone", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T18:57:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7U9OZ3KW33M", "description": "Andrea Nickatina samples  \"What The World Knows\" by Gene Page", "title": "The Mizzle Instrumental-Andre Nickatina", "publishedDate": "2010-11-10T03:34:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "7U9XZz2mHVc", "description": "swellbow in its worst form.", "title": "swollen arm hole", "publishedDate": "2007-01-24T02:32:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UA6N1YhFUE", "description": "Last week, comedian Hannibal Buress went off about Bill Cosby during a performance in Philadelphia, bringing back to the forefront the many rape accusations that have dogged the widely-beloved former Cliff Huxtable over the last several decades.\n\nWhile Cosby has always poo-pooed the accusations, one of his victims has spoken out to The Daily Mail. In a wide-ranging interview, she describes the horror she endured at Cosby\u2019s hands over several decades. Among her more disturbing quotes:\n\n\u201cHe is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.\u201d\n\u201cBill used to tell me that he was my father figure and that I needed to trust him as a father, 100 percent. Then he'd drug me and attack me. I was to afraid to talk back.\u201d\n\u201cI never took shut up money. My motivation to speak now is to expose Bill Cosby as the animal that he is. He went after me in that hotel room like an animal with such sexual prowess and force that he couldn't control himself. And at 19-years-old, I knew it would be the last time he would ever get the chance to hurt me this way again.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted me to act completely drunk, wasted, while he stood behind me and stroked my neck and upper chest. He didn't touch me beyond that, on that day, but that's where it certainly started.\u201d\n\u201cBy the time I was drugged and raped by him in New York, he'd already broken me down, brainwashed me and made me feel like there was something wrong with me if I resisted his sexual advances.\u201d\nThe graphic nature of the stories is incredibly disturbing, and there are many of them. It's definitely worth a look, even if it is hard to get through.\n\nSubscribe to Complex for More: http://goo.gl/PJeLOl\nCheck out more of Complex here:\nhttp://www.complex.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ComplexMag\nhttps://www.facebook.com/complex\nhttp://instagram.com/complexmag\nhttps://plus.google.com/+complex/\n\nEntertaining videos that bring to life Complex Media's authoritative take on trendsetting music, sneakers, style, pop culture, video games, tech, cars, and art\u2014featuring your favorite celebrities from the past, present, and future.

A 'pencil' of the scion wood, variety Queen Cox in this case, is used from storage, these need to be cut while the wood is winter-dormant e.g. February to early March, and stored cool and not too dry. I usually put them in a plastic bag in the fridge. LABEL carefully. The right time to graft is bud burst to early green leaf, roughly April. This was done on the last day of a warm southern English March.\n\nAny very sharp knife with a thin blade will do, my favourite is the Opinel 'inoxidable'(stainless) number 6 (number refers to size, Opinel make a range of knives.) My one has a walnut handle and I bought it in Bayeux, which is completely irrelevant! it must feel comfortable in your hand. The knife must be sharp enough to cut you badly or it is not sharp enough for purpose, so be careful. Note the trick of locking thumbs together and levering the knife through the wood, it reduces the risk of slipping and cutting yourself. Practice with waste wood (e.g. prunings) to get the fit right. This technique really works well, the follow up video proves it!\n\nNB the rootstocks here are MM106, and are growing in a row where I cut down some unwanted and over-large rootstocks and allowed new growths to shoot up from the stump. I then earthed these up and selected the best growths to make my own vegetatively propagated rootstocks. This is a good way to produce new trees, but the saddle graft can be used equally well to top work over an established tree to a different variety. I will show other grafting techniques in a forthcoming video.", "title": "Fruitwise apple tree grafting, the saddle graft", "publishedDate": "2008-03-31T19:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UCBSwdHtrQ", "description": "", "title": "grumpy skunk", "publishedDate": "2012-05-25T12:19:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UCGN4UjKEg", "description": "This is the 3d instrumental on my channel of a other Disney song from \"Aladdin\" with the intro song: \"Arabian Night\n\nAnd to be honest: i found this instrumental on the internet and only put some soundeffects in, just like the \"oogie boogie song\"\n\nAnd as i say at the end \"Feel free to use it for a fandub of corver\"\n\nDownload here:\nhttp://www.4shared.com/video/A6Jfi0Im/aladdin_-_arabian_night__instr.html?\n\n\u00a9Copyrights by RECISIO and Walt Disney Studios\u00a9", "title": "Aladdin - Arabian Night (Instrumental / Karaoke by RobukunX)", "publishedDate": "2012-01-10T22:36:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UChSlxmQlI", "description": "Per la terza stagione di Spit, una giuria nuova di zecca affianca Marracash e sceglier\u00e0 il nuovo king!

And as 2000 years ago, Jerusalem returns to pray - for seven days - for the unity of all Christians. By doing so, it revives many of the joys and pains of the early Church: injustice and division, but also perseverance and true recognition of a greater unity among Christians. The week of prayer begins later here than internationally to allow the Armenian Orthodox Christians in Jerusalem to celebrate Christmas according to their calendar, on January 19. From 22nd to 30th January Christians of the Holy City are to gather every evening in a different church (Catholic, Orthodox or Protestant) for an ecumenical prayer, asking God for the gift of unity. This year the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity in Jerusalem will take place at a special time: on January 29th at 5pm the Ethiopian Orthodox Church of Jerusalem will be hosting the Fifth Extraordinary Prayer of All Churches for Reconciliation, Unity and Peace.\u00a0The initiative, held in partnership with Catholica Unio (a Vatican body which promotes dialogue between the Eastern Churches and Churches of the West), is increasingly establishing itself as a time of prayer, from and for Jerusalem. Some time ago, the Mother Church called on all Christians in the world to join in a prayer of insistent joyful intercession every Saturday at 6pm local time in each country. On Saturday January 29 it will take place in the church of the Ethiopians. The prayer, which will be led by Matthias Abba, Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, will be transmitted by various Christian television networks throughout the Holy Land on the same day and on other dates. A documentary on the Ethiopian Orthodox Church will then follow. We'd like to remind you that television broadcasting is now freely available to every Christian television channel that wishes to transmit it.\u00a0These important ecumenical prayer moments also coincide with the \"International Day of Prayer for Peace in the Holy Land,\" sponsored by the Justice and Peace Commission of the Holy See and encouraged by Benedict XVI. The day will involve prayers for peace in over 2,000 cities and prayer groups throughout the world over a 24 hour period. It will begin in Jerusalem on the evening of 29th January in the Ethiopian church.", "title": "A Week of Ecumenism in Jerusalem", "publishedDate": "2011-03-12T08:54:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UHrGa4b_5U", "description": "Title: Wetting the bed (interactive video)\n\nMade possible by:\n\nCreation: Mark Jetten & Joost Esser\n\nProduction: Stefany Rietkerk & Christine Anderton (Artcore)\nDirector: Eche Janga\nD.O.P: Tibor Dingelstad\nGaffer: Django de Groot\nFocus Puller: Nina Badoux\nArt Director: Femke de Bruijn\nSound recordist: Michiel de Boer\nData handling: Nick van den Elzen\nEditor: Bjorn Mentink\n\nGirl: Francecsa Wagenaar\nGuy: Lucien van Geffen\nVoice Over: Simon Anderton", "title": "WETTING THE BED - OPTION 3", "publishedDate": "2011-06-21T14:20:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UIA4KXCWNQ", "description": "Ancient Mycenaean water management system, Kopais - Laser scanning survey by ASTROLABE ENGINEERING 2011 using FARO Focus3D Laser Scanner", "title": "Ancient Mycenaean water management system - textured 3d model of section 1", "publishedDate": "2013-01-20T19:46:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UIPMhy9l04", "description": "*All WWE programming, talent names, images, likenesses, slogans, wrestling moves, trademarks, logos and copyrights are the exclusive property of WWE, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

When they spotted the woman, they were absolutely bewildered,' he said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a big reader of Guinness World Records and I figured it was out of the ordinary, but you know you've found something special when the locals are amazed.\u2019\n\nAtaye Eligidagne, 20, dons the largest lip disk in the world. At a whopping 59.5 cm in circumference and 19.5 cm in diameter, it\u2019s over twice the size of the average disc.\n\nThe previous record disc in the Guinness Book of World Records was 15cm in diameter.\n\nLip discs are a long-running tradition amongst the Surma woman of the lower Omo Rover valley in Ethiopia.\n\nThere is evidence of woman wearing the discs in this region from 1896. The procedure, which also involves knocking out the bottom two teeth, is done at the age of 15-18. \n\nIn recent times, the Ethiopian government has taken measures to ban the discs, and the frequency amongst the younger generations is reportedly dwindling.\n\nThe discs carry a multifaceted significance. They are intended to attract a husband as well as a dowry for the family of the wife, who provide a contingent of cattle respective to the size of the disc.\n\n\u2018I think that locally, it's a matter of pride. The larger the disc, the more impressive. Young people try to outdo each other all over the world.'\n\nEligidagne has been stretching her lips for three years since the initial piercing. \n\nThe process also involved the removal of bottom two front teeth. \n\nJoffe asked for their guides to translate for the woman so he could interview her, but the guides were not fluent in Mursi, the local dialect, so they had to use a local warrior to translate for the guide.\n\n\u2018During the interview, we offered her some Coca-Cola. It was a fascinating, because she had clearly never tasted anything like it,' he said.\n\n\u2018Ataye poured it onto her tongue with the disc in place, and suddenly had this stunned expression. It was incredible.\u2019\n\nJoffe asked if there were any hurdles that come with such an unusual tradition. \n\n\u2018She said it was not painful at all and there weren't any adverse affects.'\n\nBut Eligidagne acknowledged that the discs may not be around forever.\n\n\u2018When we asked her if her daughter would adhere to the tradition, she said wasn\u2019t sure her daughter will see it the same way, and she would respect her daughters decision on whether or not to do it.\u2019\n\nMusic : Whimsy Groove by Kevin MacLeod\nBlog : http://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com\nFacebook :  https://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews", "title": "Largest Lip Plate: Woman with the World's Biggest Lip Disc - measuring nearly 60cm", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T12:23:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "7US05KIq2ts", "description": "Fairy Growing Narcotics - Jinrui wa suitai Shimashita\nImage Batch:  http://imgur.com/a/OW8Hu#0\nGif Batch: http://imgur.com/a/rmPIC#0\nPlease subscribe, and feel free to request any ~30s clip to upload(Not Sony Japan Ent.

For most of my youth I was fueled by a steady diet of my father's Muscle & Fitness magazines, Jackie Chan movies and martial arts choreography with a crew of friends and family in my backyard. \n\nBeing in shape had always been a top priority - even in my pre-teen years - but due to a late growth spurt I had always looked to the physiques in Muscle & Fitness as something that may be out of reach. Instead I opted to concentrate on the physical acrobatics of my favorite movie star from Hong Kong and only hope one day to emulate my father's old-school heroes Steve Reeves and Frank Zane. Years later and developing into my late teens, that day had finally come... \n\nFinally reaching my full grown height of 6'2\" I realized quickly that it was time to pack some serious heat in the gym and attempt to sculpt my scrawny physique into something meaningful.\n\nWith my dreams of a career in martial arts now pushed aside I began playing catch-up, living in the gym and only taking breaks to eat anything which crossed my path in order to catch up with my new competition. Working out in an antiqued dungeon of a fitness center (Lou Ferrigno's New York gym from Pumping Iron comes to mind) and with back issues of Muscle & Fitness as my guide I set my sights on a goal which would help me achieve my physical fitness aspirations: Entering my first bodybuilding competition. \n\nIn February of 2004 I did just that, winning 2nd place in the Teen division which took place in Vancouver Washington. Inspired by my placing but not yet satisfied, I entered my second contest in April taking place in Lincoln City, Oregon and achieved my first dream: I had won 1st place in a bodybuilding competition. \n\nWith the fuel of my success feeding the growing fire inside, I planned on taking a year to train, learn and come back stronger when graduating from the teen division and entering the big leagues but fate had a different plan... \n\nContacted after my bodybuilding competitions regarding possible fitness modeling, I did some test shoots and realized what a great opportunity I had stumbled upon and began pursuing future work in modeling and fitness training as opposed to my original visions of Olympia glory. \n\nWith a steady stream of photoshoots including Cosmopolitan, Muscle & Fitness and L'Uomo Vogue and a dedication to pursuing my education in physical fitness, I became a certified personal trainer and began training others in order to help them reach their potential much like I had done myself years prior. \n\nBuff Dudes / Fitness / Natural, Steroid Free Bodybuilding Transformation\nStarring: Brandon Myles White\nShot n' Edited by: Hudson\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod\n\nGriphop - ISRC: US-UAN-11-00413\nImpact Intermezzo - ISRC: US-UAN-11-00620\nPrelude and Action - ISRC: US-UAN-11-00887\n\nPixel Art By Jo\u00e3o Victor G.

In each of the cases the antibody forced the mice's immune system to kill the cancer cells.\n\nRead more: http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/03/27/scientists-find-treatment-to-kill-every-kind-cancer-tumor/#ixzz2OqSTJfH2\n\nTags: natural cancer treatment,cancer treatments,natural cure for cancer,cancer cures,cures for cancer,natural cancer cure,cancer cure,cancer articles,cure cancer naturally,new treatments for cancer,articles on cancer,natural cancer treatments, \ncancer information,alternative cancer cure,cure of cancer,turmeric cancer,treatments for cancer,cancer drug treatment,natural treatment for cancer,latest cancer treatments,natural remedies for cancer,new cancer treatments,how to cure cancer naturally,types of cancer treatment,alternative treatments for cancer,cure to cancer,cancer miracle,treatment for cancers,treatment options for cancer,cancer drugs,cancer new drug,new drug for cancer,new drug discovered for cancer,drug cure for cancer", "title": "Cancer Cure is Here !

The demonstrators were built with funding from EADS and its partners.\n\nCosts (Kosten)\nThe cost of the Barracuda programme was estimated at 40 million Euros.\n\nRemarks (Bemerkungen)\nBarracuda is a UAV technology demonstrator. Main features are:\n\n    fuselage of carbonfibre composite construction, with large upper and lower outer shells produced with the VAP method (Vacuum Assisted Process)\n    carbonfibre wings with metal substructure, detachable\n    triplex fly-by-wire system\n    open, modular avionics system\n    full electrical systems, only for the landing gear and the wheel steering, hydraulics are used.\n    fuselage bay for weapons or reconnaissance systems like IR-sensor, laser marker, SAR radar system\n\nThe Barracuda was built with contributions from the following companies:\n\n    Aerostruktur Faserverbundtechnik\n    AOA (Apparatebau Gauting)\n    Bayern-Chemie Protac\n    CAM\n    DLR\n    Eaton\n    EME\n    Entrak\n    Goodrich\n    Gore\n    Honeywell\n    Kostelezky\n    Jenoptik\n    L3 Communications\n    Liebherr\n    Meggitt (Dunlop Aerospace Braking Systems)\n    Messier-Dowty\n    MSB\n    MTU: Flight Control Computer\n    Paratec\n    Pratt & Whitney Canada: Engine\n    Reiser Systemtechnik\n    RUAG Aerospace\n    SBS Technologies\n    Smiths\n    STT-SystemTechnik\n    Thales\n\n\nHistory (Geschichte)\nBased on general studies, design work on the Barracuda began in January 2003. During the year, all partners were selected.\n2004\nAfter a critical design review in November 2003, work on hardware components began in early 2004. The fuselage was built in Augsburg while the wings came from EADS CASA in Getafe, Spain. In the summer of 2004, all the main systems were bench tested at Ottobrunn. Liebherr also built a test rig to evaluate the actuators and their electrical systems.\nAirborne tests of the navigation system were performed on board a Do 228 towards the end of 2004.\n2005\nOn 1 March 2005, the complete UAV was trucked from Augsburg to Manching.\nIn April 2005, the Do 228 testbed was used with the complete avionics system on board.\nIn August 2005, the JT15D-5C engine was installed. A first test run was performed on the 12 th of the month.\nThe \u201efirst flight configuration\" of the avionics system was tested on the Do 228 from Murcia airfield before the end of 2005.\n2006\nFirst roll tests were performed at Manching, starting on 6 January 2006.\nThe Barracuda was then flown to Murcia on board a Luftwaffe Transall.\nThe first flight was performed from Murcia/San Javier base on 2 April 2006. During the 20 minute mission, the UAV followed a pre-programmed route over the Mediterranean before landing back with great precision.\nIn Mai 2006, the Barracuda was shown at the ILA show at Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld.\nAfter ILA, the UAV was prepared for the extension of the flight envelope.\nTests at Murcia were resumed in September 2006, with high-speed taxi trials conducted on the 19 th. On 23 September 2006 the second test flight was performed, but the Barracuda crashed into the sea while approaching the runway. The cause of the accident was a \"simple\" software programme error.\nAfter the setback, EADS Military Air Systems was studying the development of another technology demonstrator, building on the Barracuda experience but more fully emphasising the reconnaissance role.\n2007\nIn October 2007, the German Ministry of Defence awarded EADS a contract as prime contractor/systems integrator for the so called \"Agile UAV in Network-Centric Environments\" project. As part of this research and technology programme, EADS will contribute the technology demonstrator Barracuda -- that is, it will build a second aircraft, which will be mostly identical with the one that crashed. The Agile UAV programme is slated to run until 2013.\n2008\nThe second Barracuda (99+81) was first seen in early November 2008 at Manching. It was identical to the first. The maiden flight was then expected sometime in the spring of 2009.\n2009\nThe first flight of the second Barracuda took place on 10 July 2009 at Goose Bay in Canada. EADS conducted a test series comprising four flights. During the test campaign in the Goose Bay area of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the jet-propelled demonstrator flew completely autonomously along pre-programmed flight profiles. It was monitored from the ground station with respect to flight safety only.", "title": "EADS Barracuda German UAV", "publishedDate": "2011-12-13T09:34:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UW8HMzwMgw", "description": "Mary 'Bullseye' Dobbin builds a curling team with some of her friends!", "title": "Curling Television Commercial   Build Your #CurlingTeam   Mary Dobbin", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T21:17:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UWU2ezCC6Y", "description": "", "title": "1 2 3 Random and Probability Sampling", "publishedDate": "2012-08-07T14:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UWWSMK287E", "description": "For more information about NSCC's Marconi Campus: http://bit.ly/1q320RK\n\nYou're never too old to learn at NSCC Marconi Campus.

This large basin, approximately the size of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, lies in the Martian highlands, near the equator.\nSource: http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-11848/#/gallery/16722\n3D Animation: http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-11848/#/gallery/16721\nHD Image:\nhttp://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/Portaldata/1/Resources/bilder/missionen/mars_2013/16_9/Hydraotes_mosaic_3d.jpg", "title": "Incredible Mars Images: Flight over Chaotic Terrain [via ESA\u2019s Mars Express orbiter]", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T23:39:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UYz2ihqiX0", "description": "Just a simple video showing the Star Bottle Cap Quest Reward Please Enjoy", "title": "Fallout: New Vegas Sunset Sarsaparilla Star Bottle Cap Reward", "publishedDate": "2010-11-24T00:54:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UZ7TLF1hoo", "description": "Idol Sverige i TV4 fr\u00e5n 2014-08-20: Idol-audition: Se Niklas Musco framf\u00f6ra l\u00e5ten Hold the line till Idol-juryn i G\u00f6teborg.\n\nSwedish idol.\n\nMer fr\u00e5n Idol Sverige p\u00e5 YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TV4IdolSweden?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSucc\u00e9programmet Idol, med en musikbranschkunnig jury i spetsen, ger sig ut p\u00e5 jakt efter Sveriges n\u00e4sta popstj\u00e4rna.\nhttp://www.tv4.se/idol", "title": "Niklas Musco - Hold the line (hela audition) - Idol Sverige (TV4)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T18:45:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UZJmDwy-ZA", "description": "Luis Carlos Ruiz Gol - Atl\u00e9tico Nacional vs Sao Paulo 1-0 Copa de Am\u00e9rica del Sur\nNacional de Medellin vs Sao Paulo Gol Y Resumen 2014\nNacional vs San Pablo Todos Los Goles Copa Sudamericana 2014\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Nacional vs Sao Paulo 2014--\nAtletico Nacional vs Sao Paulo 1-0 Gol Resumen Copa Sudamericana 2014/2015", "title": "Atletico Nacional vs Sao Paulo 1-0 Gol Resumen Copa Sudamericana HD", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T00:54:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7U_-31IY22E", "description": "ATTENZIONE: NON E VERO CHE RUBO LE CARTE AI BAMBINI NON LO MAI FATTO ERA SOLO PER FARE LA CANZONE PIU FIGA\necco a voi la mia prima canzone rapper:FIGLIO DELLA STRADA. intitolata cosi parla un po di me e delle magic e delle mie storie.GRAZIE FABIO PER AVER COSTRUITO LA CANZONE E PER IL VIDEO SEI GRANDE.

Philanthropist Inder Singh Grewal visualised an annual recreational meet where farmers from areas surrounding Kila Raipur could get together and test their corporal endurance. The idea gave birth to Kila Raipur Sports, the undisputed \"Rural Olympics\".\n\nIn over six decades the festival has grown from a toddler to a prancing, energetic youthful organisation. This pioneer rural sports festival has become an annual international event, which is normally held in the first weekend of February. A dynamic team of organisers -- Grewal Sports Association -- has taken yet again another pioneering step of giving rural women a break in sports.\n\nToday this festival of the rustics attracts more than 4,000 sportsmen and women, both of recognised and traditional sports. The three-day festival is witnessed by more than a million people. Besides, several million others watch it on television, read about it in newspapers and magazines.\n\nWhether you are in Punjab or in Toronto or in Southall, you will know the latest about Kila Raipur Sports. Its participants come from all over the globe. Since it takes several months for the immigrants in England, Canada or the USA to select, train and send their Kabbadi and Tug of War teams to this festival which of late has become a truly international, talks about destination KILA RAIPUR start much early.\n\nWhen Mr. Inder Singh Grewal and subsequently Grewal Sports Association visualised the Games, the solitary aim was, \"healthy mind in a healthy body\", the watchword has been \"excellence\", in accordance with the Olympic motto of \"CITIUS, ALTIUS, FORTIUS\". Besides, it was to provide a platform where boys and girls, men and even veterans could come and exhibit their acumen not only in recognised sporting events but also in traditional rural sports.\n\nSo it has been always the best. Those who have been watching this festival grow from year to year can vouch that they have seen hundreds of Olympians and internationals in action on the bald but even playfields of perhaps the biggest Rural Sports Stadium in the country.\n\nFor the Grewal Sports Association, it is not only the annual Rural Olympics but also sports promotion which gets its paramount attention. The Association sponsors and runs a hockey academy for schoolboys. At present 150 budding hockey stars are training at the Academy on a regular basis -- 125 of them are day boarders and 25 are boarders.\n\nThe Association plans to extend the stadium further, construct a new modern hostel for the Academy, start another academy in track and field and lay a synthetic surface for hockey. Kila Raipur and surrounding villages have made a matchless contribution to the national mainstream of sports in almost all major recognised sports.\n\nThese activities apart, Grewal Sports Association enjoy the proud privilege of being the pioneer of organised \"Rural Sports\" in the country. It is perhaps the only meet which attracts sponsors from multinational companies and where prize money attracts the best of sportsmen and women. The organisers are none other than dedicated, qualified and reputed men who have spent their youthful days on playfields of the village. No other rural sports meet can even come near the Kila Raipur sports, either in organisation or in size. It remains the biggest and the most prestigious one of its type.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

There are dogday or annual cicadas that emerge every year. Periodical cicadas emerge every 13 years in the southern half of Illinois and every 17 years in the northern half of the state. Cicadas are large bodied and have large compound eyes.\n\nDogday cicada seen head on.Cicadas are sometimes mistakenly called locusts. In actuality, they are not at all related to locusts, which are a kind of grasshopper. The male cicadas \"sing\" during the day to attract females. Dogday cicadas tend to sing more in late afternoon and evening. Each cicada species has its own distinctive sound to avoid attracting the wrong cicada. Typically, periodical cicada emergences consist of three species, that can be distinguished by the male songs as well as by slight differences in their appearance. The nymphs of these cicadas feed on the roots of trees and shrubs.\n\nThere are many species of dogday cicadas (also called harvestflies.) They are about 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd inches long and from \u00bd to 7/16 inch wide. Some species may be as long as two inches. The wings are clear membranes except for the green coloring along the leading edge of each wing. The wings are one and a half inches to two inches long depending on body size. The upper body has a green and brown pattern to green and black pattern while the lower half of the body is mostly whitish.\n\nPeriodical cicadas are also edible. Native Americans utilized them in their diet. In 1990, several college students were filmed eating them alive. When asked what they tasted like, the students reported that they tasted like almonds. Drying them in a microwave oven carefully causes them to release an almond smell.", "title": "shedding cicada", "publishedDate": "2009-08-24T03:15:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Uw_ZmLpjW0", "description": "Manassas VA August 18th 2012", "title": "Instigator Monster Truck Freestyle", "publishedDate": "2012-08-19T14:56:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7UwsH96Jt34", "description": "This video shows how to proceed the experiment number 2 of our experimentation with ablative.

I was talking to you earlier, and we decided, well I decided this is about as perfect as it gets, because it's inexpensive, it's super-easy, and it's delicious and hearty and satisfying and everything wonderful.\n\nWalter: All that good. And I make fun of you, oh the directions. The directions, folks, when you get the recipe, you'll see it's a sentence that says put everything in the pot and boil it a while.\n\nJan: Well, it really is that easy. What we're going to do, a pound of split peas, and I just picked these over, made sure there weren't any little foreign objects in there. All right and then we're just going to do a mirepoix.\n\nWalter: Yeah.\n\nJan: I've got a couple of stalks of celery and a couple of carrots that I cut up. All right. Can you get that in there?\n\nWalter: Yeah.\n\nJan: All right. And a big onion.\n\nWalter: Yep. Always the flavor of a big onion.\n\nJan: Always in the pot. And we're going to season this so simply. We've got about a tablespoon of garlic. And now, this I have to say, if you have really fresh bay leaves, with a very strong odor, go carefully because it will take over your soup. \n\nWalter: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJan: These are pretty mild and they're little.\n\nWalter: Yeah.\n\nJan: Did you just \"yeah, yeah\" me?\n\nWalter: I did.\n\nJan: Again? Walter. \n\nWalter: Well, that's what I do. \n\nJan: We wouldn't have anything to talk about if you couldn't make fun of me.\n\nWalter: No. If I couldn't pick on you, it wouldn't be any fun. \n\nJan: That's right. A little salt and pepper, and ta-da.\n\nWalter: Ham.\n\nJan: Diced ham. I've got . . . well, I wrote the recipe for two cups. I'd say that's about a cup and a half, and it doesn't matter a bit. Now, we're going to bring this to a boil. We're going to let it simmer for about 45 minutes.\n\nWalter: See, I told you. Everything in the pot and cook it for a while.\n\nJan: That's right. And I like it tender, but not mushy.\n\nWalter: And I told Jan that 100 years ago, when I lived in New Haven, Connecticut, I ate at a restaurant where I could eat for $1.67 cents a day, and one of the strong points was a split pea soup and they pureed it.\n\nJan: Well, I might try that one.\n\nWalter: Well, it was interesting. The main thing it had going for it was it was cheap.\n\nJan: Well, that's true, and so it this one.\n\nWalter: You ought to get this recipe, because it really is good. I've already tasted it.

Often the fungus that causes fungal meningitis is Cryptococcus, but that is not the only fungus that can be the culprit. Who Can Get It? - Anyone of any age, race, ethnicity, or gender can get fungal meningitis.  That being said, it is most common for people that have a weakened immune system to contract it than for others to do so.  AIDS and cancer are often the weakening factors.  Some medicines, like prednisone (a steroid) and medicines given after a transplant to ward off organ rejection can also weaken the immune system. So does surgery.

I am a long-time member and current president of the New York City Home Brewer's Guild. I've been home brewing since about 2001, and I love it. I'm crazy addicted to it, and I'm happy to share it with you today. I'm also part of the New York City Degustation Advisory Team which I formed with my partner, Mary Izett, NYCDAT.com. I'll be showing you how to home brew today. Cheers!\n\nWhat is wheat beer? There are lots of different kinds of wheat beers, like dunkelweizen. Dunkelweizen is the really dark, more banana style, clove-y beer, but when people hear the word wheat beer, they typically think about a Belgian wit, which generally are made with coriander, there's a lot of spiciness from the yeast that's being used. Or hefeweizen, which is an unfiltered wheat beer from Germany. There's weissbier, there's an American wheat; all of these have different flavor components, but there is no one single type of wheat beer. A lot of French saisons or butter-saisons use a percentage of wheat. The percentage and dominance of malted barley in those merit that it's not a wheat beer. Although, a lot of beers do use wheat in their recipes, in their total grist. \nBelgian wits and hefeweizens are some of my favorite breakfast beers of all time. With omelets and eggs, I think they're awesome and shine. And sometimes also the coriander in a Belgian wit dances with white chocolate in a way that's really, really lovely. But really, when it comes to pairing beer with food, there are certain guidelines, but no rules. Because also, within every style, everybody makes their own interpretation of that style. And so the varying degrees of hops, the varying degrees of sweetness and of dryness, you can make blanket statements about styles, but they don't always hit, because of the varying ways that brewers...the creative ingenuity of brewers within that...is vast.", "title": "What Is Wheat Beer? | Beer Brewing", "publishedDate": "2014-05-31T11:07:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7V48t48NS0E", "description": "", "title": "TUES April 26th Paraquat Kelley's Daily Beverly Hills Real Estate joke and blog 2", "publishedDate": "2011-04-26T16:32:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7V5ZFz4TeDE", "description": "Beat & Mix : Desir  \nA\u00c7IKLAMAYI OKU:\n\nVideo'nun telif haklar\u0131 Ebnai Yap\u0131ma aittir.

ARE THEY MONKEYING MORE WITH MOTHER NATURE. CHECK THIS OUT.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS AN EXCERPT OF KURT VONNEGUTS BOOKS\n A general had a problem: mud. Marines have slogged their way through it for generations. Is it possible to get rid of mud? Without having to carry anything heavy? Marines already have enough to carry.\n\nDr. Felix Hoenikker, an original thinker, found the \"outside-the-box\" answer; a single crystal of Ice-Nine would crystallize every bit of water it touched.\n\"...suppose, young man, that one Marine had with him a tiny capsule containing a seed of ice-nine, a new way for the atoms of water to stack and lock, to freeze. If that Marine threw that seed into the nearest puddle...?\"\n\"The puddle would freeze?\" I guessed.\n\"And all the muck around the puddle?\"\n\"It would freeze?\"\n\"And all the puddles in the frozen muck?\"\n\"They would freeze?\"\n\"And the pools and the streams in the frozen muck?\"\n\"They would freeze?\"\n\"You bet they would !\" He cried. \"And the United States Marines would rise from the swamp and march on!\"\nAnd where would the freezing stop? Unfortunately, the melting point of Ice-Nine was 114.4 degrees; once the entire planet locked up, it would probably never melt.\n\n(DOES THE MOVE DAY AFTER TOMORROW RING A BELL, HOW THE ICE CREPT ACROSS EVERYTHING?)\nHere's what the world looked like after Ice-Nine was released into the environment, crystallizing all water on Earth, locking it into the Ice-Nine configuration.\n\n    There were no smells. There was no movement. Every step I took made a gravelly squeak in blue-white frost. And every squeak was echoed loudly. The season of locking was over. The Earth was locked up tight \n\nIn fact, there really is a form of ice called Ice-IX. Ice-IX was discovered in 1968. It exists only under high pressure and does not have the properties of Vonnegut's ice-nine (thankfully!). Kurt Vonnegut's brother held a PhD in physical chemistry from MIT; he published papers on silver iodide and ice formation (cloud seeding). So that's one possible source for the idea.\n\nIt has also been suggested that, when Vonnegut was working at General Electric (in public relations), he was inspired by a company story relating to H.G. Wells. When Wells visited G.E. in the 'thirties, Nobelist chemist Irving Langmuir was tasked with keeping Wells entertained during his visit. Langmuir came up with an idea about a form of water that was solid at room temperature. Wells never published a story about it, but Vonnegut thought it was worth using.\n\nCrystallized water, or ice, has a greater variety of crystalline structures than perhaps any other material. Ordinary ice (like you might skate on) has a hexagonal structure; water at different temperatures and pressures forms solids that are rhombohedral, tetragonal, cubic, or orthorhombic in structure. Some forms of \"frozen\" water are disordered (non-crystalline).\n\nJust so you know, the regular ice in your refridgerator is hexagonal ice, Ice-Ih. That's what makes nice hexagonal snowflakes. Aren't you glad you asked?\n\nSee the comments for this item to read more about ice-nine and polywater.\n\nComment/Join this discussion ( 29 ) | RSS/XML | Blog This |\n\nAdditional resources:\n  More Ideas and Technology from Cat's Cradle\n  More Ideas and Technology by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.\n  Tech news articles related to Cat's Cradle\n  Tech news articles related to works by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.\n\nIce-Nine-related news articles:\n  - Ice-Nine Modeled In Harvard Computer - We're Doomed\n  - Neowater - Like Intracellular Water\n  - Ice Formation At Room Temperature Is Possible With New Material\n\nArticles related to Engineering\nQuickScann3D Has Your Full Body Duplicate\nAireal Haptics Inching Towards Holodeck Experience\nControl Your Dog Remotely\nElon Musk Creates Parts With Gestures Like Iron Man\n\nhttp://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=415", "title": "WON'T B AN EMP, IT'S ELECTRICAL DEVICE, & ICE 9, DESCRIPTION A MUST READ!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T07:00:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VB-eGD_rrU", "description": "", "title": "Hey das geht ab TECHNO", "publishedDate": "2009-06-10T12:41:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VBDxb6m42c", "description": "How to get any wifi password with iphone works on ios 7", "title": "How to get any wifi password with iphone works on ios 7", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T16:14:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VBRZdarXHU", "description": "this is an very funny vid from crazy frog", "title": "crazy frog bing bing", "publishedDate": "2010-01-17T10:12:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VBkUNBEvNc", "description": "This is footage is of the wonderful village of Pyrgi on the island of Chios, Greece.

We would be using tents initially because that's what you have to do if you're going to ramp up accommodation very quickly. And we may need a very significant accommodation capacity on Nauru.\"\nMr Abbott said the Coalition would \"hit the ground running\" with \"proper offshore processing\".\n\nHowever, he said the plan was not radically different from the Coalition's long-standing policy.\n\n\"We are just consistently, clearly working on the policies that we have been quite clear about for more than a decade,\" he said.\n\nPNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill yesterday raised new questions over where refugees would be ultimately taken under the Labor policy, telling The Australian that anyone sent to his country could wait up to eight years to be resettled there.\n\nAdding to the challenge of finding locations for regional detention centres, the Fiji government lashed out at Australia for using its Pacific neighbours to fix a domestic problem and declaring the centres would \"destabilise\" island societies.\n\nFiji Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola warned against centres he said were being discussed for the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu on the grounds they would alter the social fabric of any country that accepted a deal.\n\nThe speed and capacity of the offshore projects are central questions in the policy fight as the rate of arrivals over the past week exceeded the current housing in the Manus Island detention centre.\n\nAbout 1350 asylum-seekers have arrived since the Prime Minister unveiled his hardline stance on July 19 but there have not been any arrivals for the past three days.\n\nIn a bid to show the Labor policy taking effect, Immigration Minister Tony Burke plans to send the first people caught by the new regime to Manus Island as soon as tonight.\n\nThe Australian understands an initial transfer of about 40 single men will be flown off Christmas Island under heavy security from the Australian Federal Police.\n\nCoalition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison toured potential sites in Nauru yesterday to emphasise his argument that the island had the capacity to take 5000 asylum-seekers over time in tents and permanent facilities.\n\nThe plan includes a village on Nauru to hold those who gain refugee status, keeping them on the island while they hope for settlement elsewhere. The Coalition would expect the Nauru government to keep processing asylum-seekers - as it does under the current government policy.\n\nNeither Labor nor the Coalition would expect the host nations to house all those who arrived by boat, given that 29.5 per cent of the 1637 people taken to Nauru and Manus under the Howard government's Pacific Solution ended up returning voluntarily to their home countries. Another 43 per cent of those taken to Nauru and Manus from 2001 to 2008 were eventually settled in Australia, according to government figures.\n\nMr Morrison said yesterday that some asylum-seekers might be resettled in Australia but there was \"no guarantee\" this would happen and that refugees could be transferred to Canada, New Zealand or elsewhere.", "title": "Coalition pledges Nauru tent city", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T15:09:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VH5oM9PRgw", "description": "More info: http://www.klasema-art.nl/contact/\n\nArtists featured in this video: Joost Baljeu, Willy Boers, Andre van der Vossen, Karel Slingervoet, Jaap Egmond, Andre Volten, Shlomo Koren.\n\nhttp://www.klasema-art.nl/collection/\n\nEarly abstract Modern Artists include; Willy Boers, Hans Ittmann, Dolf Breetvelt, Youla Chapoval, Helen Gerardia, Auguste Herbin, Jean Gorin, Joost Baljeu, Andre Volten, Win Sinemus, Willem Hussem, Bill Parker, Rolph Scarlett, Leon Zack, Frida Hunziker, Andre van der Vossen and Nicolaas Warb, Willy Boers, Dolf Breetvelt, Frieda Hunziker, Willem Hussem, Joost Baljeu, Andre Volten, Juul Neumann, Theo Bitter, Klaas Boonstra, Andre van der Vossen, Wim Sinemus, Will Leewens, Leon Zack, Youla Chapoval, Serge Charchoune, Bill Parker, Helen Gerardia, Rolph Scarlett, Nicolaas Warb, Joseph Ongenae, Hendrik van Bottenburg, Jean Deyrolle, Jean Gorin, Andre Volten, Wim Crowel, Heinrich Davringhausen, Auguste Herbin, Renato Righetti, Silvano Bozzolini, Alberto Magnelli, Toon Kelder, Andre Volten, Jaap Egmond, Ferenc Gogos, Shlomo Koren, Manette van Hamel, Gerald Coarding, Walter Helbig, and Joseph Lacasse.\n\nArt movements include Ecole de Paris, lyrical abstract, abstract expressionism, geometric abstraction, material art, Pop Art, constructivism, cubism and minimalism. among others.\n\nPlease see http://www.klasema-art.nl/collection/ for more abstract Modern artworks.\n\n\nMusic by Soulistics Music Productions: http://www.soulistics.nl\n\nKlasema ART 2013.", "title": "Klasema ART Collection - Pop Art and Abstract Collages (1950-1973)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-08T09:04:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VHOGfaUFoQ", "description": "", "title": "Hummingbirds colombia - White-necked Jacobin  - Florisuga mellivora", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T23:08:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VIfs66Rj4Y", "description": "Sweet pea time ppl and Solo is trying to help.", "title": "Garden time with Scottdrum", "publishedDate": "2012-03-07T16:26:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VIgsyYiJsI", "description": "Justin Bieber sings All You Need Is Love at Scooter Braun's wedding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber\nJustin Bieber", "title": "Justin Bieber sings All You Need Is Love at Scooter Braun's wedding", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08T18:49:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7VIu2iOnOyI", "description": "Not one, but two oarfish have been spotted off the coast of Baja California earlier this month.
