The piece of paper is supposed to compel someone to do something. Usually it will be to compel a doctor's office or hospital to submit your medical records to the court.\n\nAnother use of a subpoena is to compel someone to come into court and testify on a particular day and time.\n\nThere are some injured victims who believe that simply because they bring a lawsuit, they can use a subpoena to get copies of their medical records during the litigation process.\n\nThis is not entirely accurate.\n\nThe only time that we are permitted to use a subpoena is in preparation for trial when your case is on the trial calendar and approaching your trial date. We can also use it during the course of trial to get your medical records into court or to compel witnesses to appear.\n\nIf we were to use a subpoena to compel a hospital to release your records during the pretrial litigation phase of your medical malpractice case or your car accident case or even your wrongful death case, we could suffer significant problems including fines and sanctions by the court.\n\nDoing that would be considered to be an abuse of subpoena power and could land us in hot water.\n\nThe use of subpoenas are used primarily at the time of trial to get your records into evidence. It also allows us to show a chain of custody so now when want to admit those records into evidence, we have proof that the hospital responded to our judicial subpoena and those records were then submitted directly into the evidence room at the courthouse.\n\nWatch the video to learn more...\n\nHere's a cardiac malpractice case where I was able to achieve a $6 million dollar settlement for my client: http://www.oginski-law.com/video/cardiac-malpractice-in-ny.cfm\n\nHere's a foot surgery case where a Westchester, NY jury awarded my client $1.55 million dollars for her pain and suffering: http://ow.ly/azKg6\n\nTo learn more about how medical malpractice cases work in the state of New York, I encourage you to explore my educational website, http://www.oginski-law.com/library/your-case-is-coming-up-for-trial-there-s-a-knock-at-your-door--you-are-handed-a-subpoena-to-appe.cfm\u202c.\n\nIf you have legal questions, I invite you to pick up the phone and call me at 516-487-8207 or by email at Gerry@Oginski-Law.com.

For the 180th birthday of the Grande Maison and the Centennial of Aston Martin, Jaeger-LeCoultre has created three new and very exclusive watches.\n\nMaster Compressor Extreme W-Alarm Aston Martin\nThis alarm watch is equipped with a universal hour display that lets you read the time at a glance in any time zone in the world. Powered by the Calibre 912, an automatic movement developed in the brand's workshops, the Master Compressor Extreme W-Alarm Aston Martin is a perfect combination of watchmaking expertise and sporty style, highlighted by the compression keys on the patented Jaeger-LeCoultre case. The black dial, with its alternating red and white indicators, is reminiscent of the vents on Aston Martin cars.\n\nMaster Hometime Aston Martin\nDesigned for globetrotters, the Hometime concept is now available in an Aston Martin special edition series. With its sleek, classic design, now reading two time zones is simple, thanks to the skeletonised hand indicating the reference time. Fitted with a 975H movement, the Master Hometime Aston Martin watch epitomises the values shared by the two brands: innovation, reliability and performance.\n\nAMVOX5 World Chronograph Cermet\nThe ideal function for any racing driver, the iconic chronograph function joins forces on this watch with the simultaneous display of 24 time zones. The central chronograph hand is accompanied by two counters either side of the vertical axis to record the minutes and hours since the timing started. Extremely lightweight, the reinforced cermet case houses the Calibre 752, a Jaeger-LeCoultre automatic movement.\n\nFind the collection of AMVOX watches at collection.jaeger-lecoultre.com/WW/en/collections/amvox\n\nGet all the news from Aston Martin at www.astonmartin.com/", "title": "Jaeger-LeCoultre & Aston Martin - Follow The Drive", "publishedDate": "2013-05-24T07:21:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUXlHFV9SSU", "description": "This is one of the live seminars of Mr. Chinkee Tan talking about money.\nFor more info please visit www.chinkeetan.com", "title": "Savings", "publishedDate": "2009-06-11T09:52:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUXmR0RIvzI", "description": "My indoor, supported, vining Monstera Deliciosa", "title": "Monstera Deliciosa", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T03:22:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUYEItsm7Ow", "description": "Taila takes on P!nk's emotional track.\n\nGo to www.thevoice.com.au for more news, videos and backstage galleries.", "title": "Taila Gouge sings Who Knew | The Voice Australia 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T02:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUYfP1NG2TY", "description": "Hey guys, just a quick review of the Microsoft Sidewinder X4, the cheapest backlit keyboard on the market worth buying.

Although scientists are still not completely sure why we have earwax, its purpose is to trap dust and other small particles and prevent them from reaching, and potentially damaging, the eardrum. Normally, the wax dries up and falls out of the ear, along with any trapped dust or debris. Everyone makes ear wax but the amount and type are genetically determined just like hair color or height. Some people have ear canals that are smaller than average or shaped in a way that makes it difficult for the naturally occurring wax to get out of the canal causing wax impactions.\n\n\nEARWAX CAUSES\n\n\nBlockage, or impaction, also occurs when the wax gets pushed deep within the ear canal. Earwax blockage affects about 6% of people and is one of the most common ear problems doctors see.\n\u2022 The most common cause of impactions is the use of Q-tips (and other objects such as bobby pins and rolled napkin corners), which can remove superficial wax but also pushes the rest of the wax deeper into the ear canal.\n\u2022 Hearing aid and earplug users are also more prone to earwax blockage.\n\n\nEARWAX SYMPTOMS\n\n\nSymptoms of an earwax impaction include:\n\n\u2022 Decreased hearing\n\u2022 Dizziness\n\u2022 Ear pain\n\u2022 Plugged or fullness sensation\n\u2022 Ringing in the ear\n\u2022 Itching or drainage from the ear canal\n\n\nWHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE FOR EARWAX\n\n\uf0a7 If at-home removal of wax, using over the counter ear drops, is unsuccessful\n\uf0a7 If you suspect you have a perforated eardrum (recent ear infection, injury by something poked into the ear canal, sudden severe pain followed by ear drainage, sudden hearing loss, especially after a very loud noise, bleeding from the canal, or pressure change from scuba diving)\n\uf0a7 If you develop drainage from your ear\n\uf0a7 If you experience severe ear pain, fever, or continuing hearing loss\n\n\nWHEN TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL\n\n\uf0a7 If you have a severe spinning sensation, loss of balance, or inability to walk\n\uf0a7 Persistent vomiting or high fever\n\uf0a7 Sudden loss of hearing\n\nEXAMS AND TESTS\n\nA doctor can diagnose earwax blockage (or eardrum perforation) by listening to your symptoms and then looking into your ear with an otoscope (ear-scope).\n\n\nEARWAX TREATMENT AND SELF-CARE AT HOME\n\n\nYou may try a few earwax removal methods at home unless you have a perforation (hole) or a tube in your eardrum.\n\uf0a7 Over-the-counter wax softening drops such as Debrox and Murine or warmed mineral oil may be put into the affected ear and then allowed to drain out after about five minutes while holding the head to the side, allowing the drops to settle. Sitting up again will let the drops drain out by themselves.\n\uf0a7 A bulb-type syringe may be used to gently flush the ear with warm water. Ear-Clear is a warm-water irrigation device that is available online for about $25-30. It is very important not to use forced water such as a Water Pik, because this may cause damage to the eardrum.\n\uf0a7 Ear candling is not recommended. The procedure uses a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth on the tapered end. The tapered end is placed inside the ear, and an assistant lights the other end, while making sure your hair does not catch on fire. In theory, as the flame burns, a vacuum is created, which draws the wax out of the ear. Limited clinical trials, however, showed that no vacuum was created, and no wax was removed. Furthermore, this practice may result in serious injury.\n\n\nMEDICAL TREATMENT FOR EARWAX BLOCKAGE\n\n\nThe doctor may remove your earwax with a small plastic spoon called a curette, or by irrigating your ear with warmed water, sodium bicarbonate, or other prescription-strength eardrops.\n\n\nPREVENTING EARWAX BLOCKAGES\n\n\nEarwax blockage can be prevented by avoiding the use of cotton-tipped swabs or Q-tips and other objects that push the wax deeper into the ear canal.\n\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nComplications of Earwax Blockages\n\u2022 Perforated eardrum\n\u2022 Middle-ear infection \n\u2022 External-ear infection (swimmer's ear )\n\u2022 Permanent hearing loss from acoustic trauma", "title": "Ear wax removal Unbelievable what comes out.", "publishedDate": "2013-07-23T11:02:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUe7hFFf5ak", "description": "Jeff performed this Shonnen Knife cover live at Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, on May 4 1995.

For each nut I recorded the guitar acoustically then amplified.  I like to hear acoustic differences that turn into tone changes amplified and I think it is a good way to consider how the changes one is making affects the instrument.\n\nThe stock nut was the synthetic, it is of an unknown material. I call it plastic in the video, but after removing it I found it to be more brittle than most plastics. It however did deform before cracking. \n\nThe bone nut is a bleached bone nut.  I can't speak to the type of bone, I presume it is bovine in origin.  I made this one up from a blank. \n\nThe buffalo horn nut I also made from a blank. I don't know the type of buffalo. \n\nNotes: The bone and buffalo horn nuts were my first nut making ventures. The bone nut did not have as tight of a fit as the buffalo horn nut did. I made the blank for the buffalo horn from a larger piece where the bone was a sized blank for a fender style neck. I an undoubtedly did a much better job on the buffalo horn nut than the bone nut.  The value I found in doing this comparison is that not only the material used in the nut, but how well it is fit to the nut slot and overall construction influences the sound quality aside from the playability. In other words the material definitely influences the sound, but any gain in tonal quality is also subject to how well it is installed and constructed. I like the buffalo horn nut most because it seems to provide a bigger rounder sound. A guitar is the sum of a lot of little things transmitting the sound characteristic and a nut is one of many components.  It's hard to say for certain what the difference in sound are, but I can say that having the guitar in my hands while playing and listening to it acoustically it feels bigger and more resonant than before.", "title": "Nut Comparison - Synthetic / Bone / Buffalo Horn", "publishedDate": "2012-10-31T13:51:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUjzrS6jwiw", "description": "From Real Time With Bill Maher, October 14, 2011.", "title": "Penn Jillette Explains His Libertarian Philosophy", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T03:17:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUkJENvQAbw", "description": "La C\u00e1tedra Libre Bertolt Brecht surge a partir de la necesidad tanto de organizaciones de distinta \u00edndole (Pol\u00edtica y Gremial) como de artistas no-agrupados/as de construir una herramienta con una perspectiva y l\u00ednea revolucionaria dentro del arte que nos ayude a re-pensar el presente.\n\nAs\u00ed y ante la hegemon\u00eda del posmodernismo y las perspectivas capitalistas en el arte hoy en d\u00eda, entendemos la necesidad imperiosa que tenemos los artistas revolucionarios de contar con una herramienta de estas caracter\u00edsticas.\n\nEntendiendo que la Academia hoy en d\u00eda omite y niega de forma deliberada las experiencias revolucionarias del Arte y que, al presentarlas, por lo general borran la fuerte ligaz\u00f3n de estos movimientos con las organizaciones pol\u00edticas entendi\u00e9ndolas como \u201ccosas aisladas\u201d negando la idea de que todos estos procesos van de la mano y tienen una relaci\u00f3n dial\u00e9ctica entre ellos.\n\nTeniendo la perspectiva de darle un enfoque de clase a nuestra historia para que nos ayude a revisar la pr\u00e1ctica que llevamos adelante hoy en d\u00eda y podamos repensar como es la forma que toma un arte cr\u00edtico para nuestro presente, apuntamos a que este sea un espacio de debate y discusi\u00f3n tanto para docentes como estudiantes y artistas en general, entendiendo que es una necesidad de todo el sector y que le pueda aportar a todas las personas con distinta cantidad de herramientas adquiridas previamente para cuestionar la sociedad en la que vivimos e impulsar la acci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y revolucionaria.", "title": "C\u00e1tedra Libre Bertolt Brecht", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T12:17:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUkSqDHCPW0", "description": "Versi\u00f3n Final del P\u00e9ndulo Invertido controlado con l\u00f3gica difusa en los laboratorios de electronica de la Facultad Regional Neuqu\u00e9n.", "title": "Pendulo Invertido UTN - FRN L\u00f3gica Difusa", "publishedDate": "2013-11-29T18:18:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUkgdMF7Gw8", "description": "Today you're in for a real treat, I know I'm biased, but my Mum makes the best potato salad, outside opinion has also confirmed this!

The active ingredient is released from metallic phosphide compounds which react with water vapour in the atmosphere to liberate Phosphine gas.\n\nMost food stuffs may be safely treated with this fumigant, which when applied at the correct dosage rate will not damage or taint the commodity being treated. It's penetrative qualities mean it is the fumigant of choice for treating 'grain' in storage and in transit aboard ship.\n\nSufficient time must be allowed for Phosphine to work effectively. The time 'under gas' is referred to as the 'exposure period' and for Phosphine this is unlikely to be less than 48 hours. Additionally time should be added to ventilate the commodity to ensure it is free from all traces of the fumigant. Once the commodity has been ventilated no toxic residues remain. When Phosphine tablets (or pellets) are used to fumigate grain, it needs to be cleaned to remove any non toxic residues that may remain. This is especially important when fumigating grain to ensure it maintains a clean passport.\n\nBecause no toxic residues remain in the commodity there is no residual protection, as a result fumigation should be considered as part of an overall 'integrated pest management' regime.\n\nRentokil employs and throughly trains a specialist team of fumigation operators. Each of whom must demonstrate their competence before being designated as an 'operator in charge' and by sitting annual stewardship training in the safe and effective use of the fumigant product.\n\nFor more information, visit www.rentokil.com", "title": "Phosphine Fumigation by Rentokil", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T15:42:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUn6_JEM9jc", "description": "Many people wonder how to mow lawn stripes like the pros.

For a free, no obligation review of your claim by a False Claims Act attorney, please visit our site or call toll-free 1.800.541.7358.\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nBefore you take any legal action, it is a good idea to consult an attorney who has experience handling False Claims Act cases and who can offer useful advice on how best to proceed and investigate your case. If you decide to proceed with a whistleblower lawsuit, your attorney can help you assemble as strong a case as possible. The more prepared you are before filing suit, the greater your chances of success. \n\nIt is also important not to discuss the fraud with anyone but your attorneys prior to filing our lawsuit. If others hear of the fraud and file a whistleblower's suit before you, your lawsuit is at risk of being dismissed. Under the False Claims Act, a whistleblower lawsuit must be filed within 6 years from the date of the fraud or 3 years after the government knew or should have known about the fraud. But in any event no later than 10 years after the fraud. \n\nDespite this lengthy period, the sooner you file your lawsuit the better. One reason is that if the government discovers the fraud on its own and starts its own lawsuit or investigation before you file your whistleblower suit, your suit will be at risk of dismissal. Lieff Cabraser has an active practice representing whistleblowers in both federal and state False Claims Act cases. \n\nOur attorneys are highly experienced and have a track record of success with such lawsuits. We offer our clients the advantages of a national law firm with the financial resources to take on and prevail against the nation's largest corporations. We want to help you. We will review your claim for free and with no obligation.\n\nAttorney Advertising Disclaimer/Statute of Limitations Notice: This video may be considered an advertisement in certain jurisdictions.

All attorneys depicted in the video are Lieff Cabraser attorneys. Any other persons depicted in the video are actors or models and not clients of the law firm. You should be aware that the Statute of Limitations (the deadline imposed by law within which you may bring a lawsuit) may severely limit the time remaining for you to file any potential claim you may have.\n\nhttp://www.lieffcabraser.com/Practice-Areas/False-Claims-Act/", "title": "How to Bring a Whistleblower Lawsuit", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T00:40:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUpWXScdpRA", "description": "", "title": "CONF JOVEM GUAMA", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T12:35:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUq7dzn0thg", "description": "I just happened to pick this up on my dashcam today in aberdeen MD along I95 north.

Ecovative's patented process combines agricultural byproducts with fungal mycelium, a natural, self-assembling binder, to literally grow high performance insulation. We grew a tiny house on a trailer as a radical demonstration of this technology, and this is now available for sale as a kit. The tiny house market is small but growing rapidly, and we see this as a proving ground for the $21B rigid board foam insulation market. \n\nRigid board insulation like extruded polystyrene is made of finite petrochemicals, and often includes high global-warming potential blowing gasses that seep out over time, lowering the aged R-value. Loose fill and batt insulation can settle, especially in a movable tiny house, which compromises effectiveness. In order to meet fire safety codes, nearly all rigid board and loose fill insulation materials are made with harsh flame retardant chemicals. \n\nThe Mushroom Tiny House has walls made of pine tongue and groove boards and hollow cavities with no studs. Within these walls, live Mushroom\u00ae Insulation is packed. In three days, the mycelium grows and solidifies these loose particles into air sealed insulation, while also adhering to the pine boards creating an extremely strong sandwich. The result is similar to a structural insulating panel (SIP); this layer of continuous insulation has no thermal bridging. Over the course of about a month, the Mushroom Insulation naturally dries and goes dormant. Mushrooms will only fruit through gaps or due to improper construction, and can be easily trimmed off with a knife before they produce spores. The Mushroom Tiny House fully embodies the Cradle to Cradle ethos. \n\nMaterial health: We combine corn stalks from local farms with fungal tissue from local forests and grow a biobased material that has no synthetic chemicals and emits no VOCs. \n\nMaterial reutilization: Mushroom\u00ae Insulation is primarily made from corn stalks, an agricultural byproduct. Just as wood will not rot in a properly built home, Mushroom Insulation will not degrade unless it is broken up and put in a compost pile. \n\nRenewable energy: A hydroelectric plant powers our efficient bio-production process, and we buy BEF carbon offsets for our natural gas use. \n\nWater stewardship: Little wasted water goes down the drain from our process, and there is nothing harmful in the effluent. Unlike plants, fungi do not need to be repeatedly watered. \n\nSocial fairness: Ecovative is creating green collar jobs and we are proud to be an equal opportunity company that empowers all employees to use their full potential to make planet Earth a better place. \n\nThe cost of Mushroom\u00ae Insulation is $0.25/board foot which is comparable to SIPs and is often cheaper than studs plus loose fill or batt insulation, when labor is valued. The insulation is performance competitive at R-3/inch and has superior strength characteristics. The Mushroom Tiny House was recently unveiled to much acclaim at the first ever Tiny House Fair at the Yestermorrow Design Build School in Vermont.

These endangered elephants are a distinct species found only in Borneo and not, as once thought, a sub-species of the Asian elephant. \n\nFor now, the long-term survival of the species will rely on the various Sabah Government Departments, NGO's, Local Community, Tourism agencies and Private Agricultural companies.\n\nSee more story here: http://www.cedeprudente.blogspot.com\n\nAll rights reserved 2013\u00a9", "title": "Bornean elephants in Oil Palm Plantation, Sabah, Malaysia", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T13:58:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "BUyNvktr3c8", "description": "Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 rostlina rostouc\u00ed na oslun\u011bn\u00fdch kamenit\u00fdch str\u00e1n\u00edch, bez p\u0159\u00edtomnosti v\u00e1pence ve st\u0159edn\u00edch,a z\u00e1padn\u00edch \u010cech\u00e1ch.

Each episode is approximately 5 minutes long. The show revolves around Peppa, an anthropomorphic female pig, and her family and friends. Each of her friends is a different species of mammal. Peppa's friends are the same age as she, and Peppa's younger brother George's friends are the same age as him. Episodes tend to feature everyday activities such as attending playgroup, going swimming, visiting their grandparents, cousins, going to the playground or riding bikes.\n\nThe characters wear clothes, live in houses, and drive cars, but still display some characteristics of the animals on which they are based. Peppa and her family snort like pigs during conversations in which they are speaking in English, the other animals make their respective noises when they talk, with some exhibiting other characteristics, such as the Rabbit family's enjoyment of carrots. The Rabbits are also the sole exception to the rule of human-like habitation, in that they live in a burrow in a hill, although it does have windows and is furnished in the same way as the other houses. The characters also blush when embarrassed and their mouths are used to express other emotions such as sadness, happiness, irritation, bewilderment and confusion. Although the mammals are anthropomorphic, other animals are not, for example, the ducks, Tiddles the tortoise, and Polly Parrot. In addition, a narrator reinforces the action and humor, saying things like \"Oh, dear\" when something unfortunate happens (such as George starts crying) or \"Look out!\" when a character is doing something unsafe (such as Peppa riding her bicycle without looking where she's going).\n\nThe first series of 52 five-minute episodes started on Channel 5 on 31 May 2004, and had its American premiere as part of Cartoon Network's Tickle-U preschool television programming block on 22 August 2005, and Noggin in December 2007 and January 2008.

In the United Kingdom, it can also be seen on Nick Jr., the same with Portugal, Italy, Benelux, Scandinavia and Australia. In Taiwan, the show can be seen on Playhouse Disney. The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on Monday 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, amongst other cast changes. The third series started broadcasting on the Channel 5 kids block, Milkshake! on 4 May 2009 with Harley Bird replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa\n\npeppa pig, peppa pig  English episodes, Peppa pig 2 cartoon, peppa pig 2014,peppa pig new episodes,peppa pig full episodes,peppa pig new episodes 2014, peppa pig full movie, peppa pig espa\u00f1ol,Peppa Pig Full Screen\n====================================\nPeppa pig\nPeppa pig english episodes\npeppa pig games\npeppa pig full screen\npeppa pig new episodes 2014\npeppa pig 2014\n===============================\npeppa pig hd\npeppa pig cartoon\npeppa pig full episode", "title": "Peppa Pig English Episodes Games | Peppa Pig- \u0130ce skating 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T17:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "BV2dcumgDvU", "description": "Final trailer: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes with Andy Serkis\n\u2799 Book Tickets: http://smarturl.it/ApesTickets\n\u2799 More Apes clips: http://smarturl.it/apesclips\n\u2799 Like on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ApesMoviesUK\n\u2713 Subscribe now for more : http://smarturl.it/Apes\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes in cinemas July 17\n\nTen years pass as the Simian Flu strikes around the world, causing mankind to cripple by dissension and the epidemic's effects.

But because Muscadinex is made only from fresh muscadine grape seeds, you get the full natural spectrum of polyphenols, antioxidants and bioflavonoids.\n\nWe think that's important because it's more balanced. And many scientists believe that the healthy molecules resveratrol, ellagic acid and quercetin have a synergistic effect too. \n\nIn other words ... the different molecules that mother nature put in the muscadine grape help each other to make you healthier.\n\nSo why is red wine, in moderation, healthy? Scientists first discovered the resveratrol in wine when they were doing research into the 'French Paradox'. \n\nResearchers were trying to work out why the French have a fatty diet with lots of cheese and cream ... and yet they have a 42% lower rate of heart disease than Americans.\n\nThe answer turned out to be resveratrol, ellagic acid, quercetin and other molecules in wine. So by taking the blend of molecules found in Muscadinex, you're getting the balanced spectrum of polyphenols and flavonoids which are also found in wine.\n\nYou see, the muscadine grape is America's strongest source of grape seed resveratrol. And Muscadinex contains only but the seed, with nothing added or taken away.\n\nSo you get red wine health ... but without the alcohol, and at a fraction of the cost of wine.\n\nMuscadinex is 100% USA quality.

Serving up a mixture of wicked polka beats, trash metal, world jazz and Zappa-Rock, Russkaja are probably the most successful innovators in what they call \"Russian Turbo Polka Metal\". Russkaja are very Russian, but always with a wink. That's what happens when a group of Russians, Ukrainians and Austrians decide to start a band in the world capital of classicism, Vienna. The band's third album \"Energia!\" is an explosive mix: Thrash Metal, Funk, Worldmusic - all combining to create songs which make you want to dance. Made up of skilled and charismatic musicians with varied cultural backgrounds, Russkaja spread their postmodern version of Russian folklore -- a version that screams into your ear: \"dance, dance, dance!\" Band founder Georgij A. Makazaria was born and raised in MoscowGeorgij's voice, mixed with a rock band setup, plus a violinist and an incredible brass section including an instrument called \"Potete\" (a unique hybrid of trumpet and trombone) already suggests the lunatic nature of Russkaja's sound. The Sojusrocket is launching! With Russkaja, Kasatchok dancing becomes a brawl: the brass section is a Kalashnikov and the stage outfits a mixture of Genghis Khan and the Red Army.....with compliments of the Tzar, of course. With two successful albums, 300 concerts on both sides of the Iron Curtain, the band has more than deserved the title of \"Working Class Hero\" including a golden badge of honour. The first five-year-plan has finally been fulfilled, some comrades would be proud indeed! The next one starts with \"Energia!\"!\n\nTRANSLATION:\nDo you want more or is your jag enough\nthe russians are here after a day\u00b4s march\nlet\u00b4s start the energy exchange\nCome on everybody move your ass\n\nmove your shoulders (uh yeah)\nhands and feets (uh yeah)\nmove your hips in circles\nnow we break through the language barrier\n\nEnergy \n\nAre you ready to break down the wall\ndo it now crack the bone till it falls\nlet\u00b4s run around\nlift off the ground\n\nelectrical supply inside of you is the aggregate\nrise of the voltage 5000 Watts\nby the energy exchange we will be united\nby those who\u00b4re with us, those who\u00b4re here\nthose repeat after me\n\nmove your shoulders (uh yeah)\nhands and feets (uh yeah)\nmove your hips in circles\nnow we break through the language barrier\n\nEnergy", "title": "RUSSKAJA - Energia | Napalm Records", "publishedDate": "2013-03-16T20:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVWrHuEDFk0", "description": "Coming later this year...\nOur first feature film: 'Gateway to the Past' \nby Paul Conway & Ian Smith\n\nCURRENTLY IN POST-PRODUCTION\n\nSynopsis:\nIn the year 2050AD, an ambitious scientist and palaeontology expert Professor Isenhour organises a major research project in his company labs - a research projects on dinosaurs of 3 different eras - and so he sends the armed forces and a palaeontologist through a time portal millions of years into the past to extract the listed dino DNA for his research project.    \n\nThe 3 eras:\n- Triassic\n- Jurassic\n- Cretaceous\n\nBrought to you by CSCB Productions - http://www.youtube.com/user/gatewaytothepast?feature=mhee\n& being promoted by\nINNER i PRODUCTIONS - http://www.youtube.com/user/anb90purplelover/featured\n\nEdited by Ashley Bennett (of INNER i PRODUCTIONS)\n\nIn this video:\nIan Smith: Interviewer\nLaura Richardson: Actress, camerawoman \n\nSoftware: Pinnacle Studio v15 HD Ultimate\n\nMusic: \n- 'Dramatic Theme'", "title": "Gateway To The Past | 1st Interview With Laura", "publishedDate": "2012-08-05T02:29:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVWtBl7ROXU", "description": "Devotion and Trustworthiness in Marital Homes.

Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, marine mammals, turtles, and aquatic plants. The term combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning \"a place for relating to\".[1]\nAn aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic plastic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.An aquatic animal is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in water for most or all of its life.[1] Some examples of invertebrates are cnidarians. This phylum consists of jellyfish, anemones, corals, and hydras. Another type of invertebrate aquatic animal is the annelids which are segmented worms. There are three different classes they are polychaetes, oligochaetes, and hirudinea.[2] It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). Animals that move readily from water to land and vice versa are referred to as amphibians. When animals live in water, they have special adaptations to help them survive in an aquatic habitat. The more time the animal spends in the water the quicker they adapt to their new habitat. There are numerous ways that an aquatic animal can adapt to their habitat.\nThe term aquatic can in theory be applied to animals that live in either freshwater (freshwater animals) or saltwater (marine animals). However, the adjective marine is most commonly used for animals that live in saltwater, i.e. in oceans, seas, etc. Invasive aquatic animals require a water habitat, but do not necessarily have to live entirely in water.[3]\nAquatic animals (especially freshwater animals) are often of special concern to conservationists because of the fragility of their environments. Aquatic animals are subject to pressure from overfishing, destructive fishing, marine pollution and climate change.In addition to water breathing animals, e.g., fishes, mollusks etc., the term \"aquatic animal\" can be applied to air-breathing aquatic or sea mammals such as those in the order Cetacea (whales), which cannot survive on land, as well as four-footed mammals like the river otter (Lontra canadensis) and beavers (family Castoridae).\nAquatic animals include for example the seabirds, such as gulls (family Laridae), pelicans (family Pelecanidae), and albatrosses (family Diomedeidae), and most of the Anseriformes (ducks, swans and geese).\nAmphibious and amphibiotic animals, like frogs (the order Anura), while they do require water, are separated into their own environmental classification. The majority of amphibians (class Amphibia) have an aquatic larval stage, like a tadpole, but then live as terrestrial adults, and may return to the water to mate.\nCertain fish also evolved to breathe air to survive oxygen-deprived water, such as arapaima (family Osteoglossidae) and walking catfish.", "title": "Beautiful Aquarium With Romantic Fishes........", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T15:13:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVXFlezeHDk", "description": "Preguntas y respuestas de cultura general que enriquecen el conocimiento.", "title": "Preguntas y respuestas de cultura general", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T19:53:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVXM0Ivs-Ec", "description": "ECS -- DRAIN FLUSH is a powerful, non-corrosive oxidizer stabilized for long-term storage and formulated specifically for use in kitchen drains, grease traps, lift stations, and surgical drains.\n\nECS --DRAIN FLUSH is ideally suited to remove heavy fat and grease build ups in drain lines and grease traps.

The title might be translated as \"Summer has come in\" or \"Summer has arrived\".[1]\n\nThe round is sometimes known as the Reading rota because the manuscript comes from Reading Abbey though it may not have been written there. It is the oldest piece of six-part polyphonic music (Albright, 1994). Its composer is anonymous, possibly W. de Wycombe, and it is estimated to date from around 1260. The manuscript is now at the British Library. The language is Middle English, more exactly Wessex dialect.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer_Is_Icumen_In\n\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:\nCuckoo - Cuculus canorus - Family: Cuculidae\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:\n\nThe cuckoo is a medium sized bird about the size of a pigeon. A summer visitor to England, cuckoos arrive in April and the adults leave as early as the end of July. The young leave later, finding their way back to an Africa they have never seen before. This is, famously, a parasitic bird - the female lays a single egg in the nest of smaller birds such as reed warblers, dunnocks and meadow pipits. When the young cuckoo hatches, it forces the other eggs out of the nest, and is then reared by the hosts. It has declined in abundance since the 1980s, possibly because of similar decreases in the numbers of nest host species such as dunnock and meadow pipit.\n\nCuckoos are generally a grey colour with the females being slightly browner. The primary feathers on the wings are black as is the tail but with white markings along its length. When the bird is perching the wings are held in a downward position, looking as if they do not fold properly, and the tail is held up, making it look slightly awkward. In flight, their appearance is superficially similar to the kestrel, with sharp, backswept wings and a powerful wing beat. It is only the male who makes the familiar call at the beginning of the breeding season in spring. Occasionally, three notes are heard rather than two. Cuckoos are found in a range of habitats including woodland, marshland, heath and open moorland.\n\nThey can often be heard from gardens and occasionally seen passing overhead but you need to be a little fortunate actually to see one in your garden.\n\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:\nFood\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:\n\nInsects: this is one of the only species able to eat hairy caterpillars. On arrival in the spring they are often seen gorging themselves on newly emerged caterpillars of the drinker moth.

She was also well known for her fundraising work for international charities, and an eminent celebrity of the late 20th century. Her wedding to Charles, heir to the British throne and those of the 16 Commonwealth realms, was held at St Paul's Cathedral and seen by a global television audience of over 750 million. While married she bore the courtesy titles Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Chester and Baroness of Renfrew. The marriage produced two sons, the princes William and Harry,[2] currently second and third in line to the throne.\nDiana was born into an aristocratic English family with royal ancestry and became a public figure with the announcement of her engagement to Prince Charles. Diana also received recognition for her charity work and for her support of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. From 1989, she was the president of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, in addition to dozens of other charities. She remained the object of worldwide media scrutiny during and after her marriage, which ended in divorce on 28 August 1996. Media attention and public mourning were great after her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997.\nDiana was born in the late afternoon on July 1st 1961, in Sandringham, Norfolk.[3][4] She was the fourth of five children of the Viscount and Viscountess Althorp (n\u00e9e Frances Roche, later Shand Kydd).[3] The Spencer family was hoping for a male heir to carry on the Spencer title (their third child, a boy, died soon after birth).[4][5] The Spencer family is one of Great Britain's oldest and most important families there, closely allied with the royal family for several generations.[6] As the family was expecting a boy, no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after a Spencer ancestress and her mother.[4] Diana has three siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles;[3][5] and was baptized at Sandringham church; her younger brother, Charles, was baptized at Westminster Abbey with Elizabeth II as principal godparent.[7] Diana also had an infant brother, John, who died a year before she was born.[5] According to Andrew Morton's biography of Diana, the infant John Spencer was so deformed and sick he only survived 10 hours after his birth.[4] The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to Harley Street clinics in London to determine the cause of the \"problem\".[4] The experience was described as \"humiliating\" by Charles Spencer, the current earl: \"It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it.\"[7] Diana grew up in Park House, which was situated near to the Sandringham estate.", "title": "PRINCESS DIANA Funeral Queen Elizabeth II speech", "publishedDate": "2012-04-21T03:07:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVuTXjmV6wk", "description": "This is not a real trailer, I just made it because how cool would it be if they had their own movie and tell the world a little bit of their story and stuff.\n\nTwitter: whatever5h", "title": "Fifth Harmony Movie - One Wish", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T21:58:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVudAVB5hd0", "description": "", "title": "Dwight Bargainer vs Horace Morgan(Lightweight Finals)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-06T01:26:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVugWKIW3u0", "description": "http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Chatter-Telephone---/dp/B005H7BVXQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1362772928&sr=1-2&keywords=fisher+price+chatter+telephone", "title": "Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T20:25:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVujbSBB4tk", "description": "www.LoyolaProductions.com\nJesuit Production Company, Los Angeles", "title": "Jesuits On...Ignatius Loyola", "publishedDate": "2006-11-27T23:50:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BVuuMF5IbKI", "description": "Shows the two focal sheets (upper and middle part of the image) of an elliptic paraboloid (bottom part).

With mortgage availability benchmarked at 100, although it's currently at  111 \u00bd, compared with the 800 it stood at in 2007, today's is still a tough environment.\n\nThat's why Palm Beach County seller financing is being considered by more homeowners. When a home is owned outright, seller financing can draw a higher selling price (with future interest payments as a bonus). But before making such an offer, Palm Beach County homeowners need to consider all of the ramifications: there is more involved than just the assumption of added risk.\n\n\nRead More:\nhttp://www.christianpenner.com/palm-beach-county-seller-financing-can-be-a-powerful-inducement/\n\nQuestions, Comments or For more information you can email Christian Penner at Christian@ChristianPenner.com or visit us online at www.ChristianPenner.com or you can call us directly at: 561-316-6800\nChristian Penner\nMortgage Banker | Mortgage originator\nhttp://Www.ChristianPenner.com\nhttp://Www.YourMortgageSolutionsNow.com\nhttp://valoanswestpalmbeach.com/\nFor Other Resources: from Christian Penner\nhttp://goo.gl/i2EORO", "title": "Palm Beach County Seller Financing Can Be a Powerful Inducement", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T21:34:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWIPZvwcnX8", "description": "\"A persistent cat helps Simon finish his work.\"\n\n\nDon't forget to SUBSCRIBE!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=simonscat\n\n\nThe official Simon's Cat website and shop:\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.simonscat.com\nOfficial webshop: http://www.simonscat.com/Shop\n\n\nStay connected with Simon's Cat on your favourite websites:\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/simonscat\nGoogle+: http://plus.google.com/+SimonsCat\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/SimonsCat\nTumblr: http://simonscat.tumblr.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/simonscat\n\nThe Simon's Cat Extra Youtube channel for behind the scenes and tutorials: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/simonscatextra\n\nWhat software do you use?\nSimon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash.\n\nIf you want to email us:\ncontact@simonscat.com\n\nThank you for watching :)", "title": "Cat & Mouse - Simon's Cat", "publishedDate": "2011-09-02T18:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWIbqk0Ax5o", "description": "Filmed at The Lamb Inn, Sandford...for CRAMP open mic night", "title": "Big City by The Pallbearer", "publishedDate": "2013-04-01T20:57:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWIdUHF2lUU", "description": "Bangor, North Wales.\n\nDrunk guy takes a piss* in the street in the middle of the afternoon, then takes a spill trying to pull his balog up!

If you do it well, you may have just found a solution to your company's problems and filled a valuable position with a valuable person. If you do it poorly, you might have just committed the business equivalent of riding home with a drunk driver. A bad hiring choice can be a killer.\n\nPre Employment Testing can make your job a lot easier. You can use a pre employment assessment in a couple of ways... \n\nYou can test employees to verify the results from job interviews and avoid hiring someone who simply interviews well. You can also avoid NOT hiring a job candidate who interviews poorly but would have been an incredible asset to your business. \n\nYou can also use testing to pre-screen job candidates at the beginning of the recruitment process in order to avoid spending time and resources on a candidate who is not qualified per their test results.\n\nIf you really want to streamline the hiring process, you can also simply use the test to make your selection for you. This helps you avoid hiring based on emotional reasons, \"instincts\" or just plain desperation. Sometimes it can be useful to remove the human factor from the equation and just rely on the science of testing. \n\nFurthermore, users of our test who have developed their abilities to spot good candidates in an interview will begin to notice, once they start doing testing, that the traits they always look for in a successful candidate can be seen on the personality test results of those same candidates. This helps confirm your \"gut decisions\" with scientific facts. \n\nOur pre-employment personality test for employee assessment tests ten separate and crucial employee personality traits. The strength or weakness of each trait is shown separately, on a graph, so that you may evaluate each candidate for individual traits. \n\nTo see the effectiveness of this employment screening tool, go here to take the test for free yourself: http://measurablesolutions.com/personnelpotentialanalysis/\n\nhttp://measurablesolutions.com/physical-therapy-marketing", "title": "Pre Employment Testing", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T17:20:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWJC16VFkj0", "description": "Warning All Data will be erased and restored to factory settings.\n\nHard Reset (Factory Restore) Password Wipe\n1.

One of the reasons might be an aspect of health care reform that focuses on training mothers in staying healthy throughout their pregnancy.\n\nHundreds of pregnant women come every week for checkups and treatment. Prenatal care, free of charge and close to their homes has become a corner stone of Indias campaign to bring down maternal and infant mortality rates.  And many first-time mothers get more than medical support. \n\nSOUNDBITE (Tamil) Sunati, Pregnant Woman:\nI come every two weeks for a checkup and they give me the medication and supplements I need. They also asked me to eat a lot of greens, iron-rich foods and eggs. \n\nPoverty, malnutrition and lack of knowledge about healthy behavior lay at the heart of many pregnancy-related complications. Sometimes women cannot afford to eat properly or to make long trips to the clinics where they could get prenatal care. \n\nAs a result, problems can go undetected and babies are born too early and sick. Like Dirvya, who was only 1.8 kilos at birth because her mother ate too little while working too hard. \n\nSOUNDBITE (Tamil) Mghala, Mother:\nI did not take the supplements that are recommended. But now that I see what happened to my baby, I know what I need to do next time.\"\n\nDirvya was lucky. She was referred to the districts neonatal unit where specialists will help her to get strong and healthy. \n\nSOUNDBITE (English) Dr. Kirupakaran, Assistant Surgeon:\nBecause of poor nutrition she delivered the baby with a low birth weight. For this reason the baby was referred here. We will keep the baby for one week to prevent complications like hypoglycemia and neonatal jaundice. \n\nWith support from the World Bank the Indian state of Tamil Nadu has implemented a comprehensive health care initiative. Even poor and marginalized women now find basic prenatal care and specialized services without having to travel long distances. \n\nCare includes health education, HIV/AIDS testing and counseling, and nutritional support. Fully equipped ambulances are available to rush women from their homes to hospitals, often making the difference between life and death for mothers and their newborn. \n\nPatients are noticing the difference.\n\nSOUNDBITE (Tamil) Manoharmani, Grandmother: \nMy daughter was born in this hospital. They are doing a better job now than before. This is my grandson, he was born here. We are not going anywhere else because they are taking care of us very well.\n\nFor years now, the improvements in the health system of Tamil Nadu have helped to make pregnancy safer and bring down maternal and infant mortality rates.\n....................................... ................. ........................................ ...................

People claiming to have been abducted are usually called \"abductees\" or \"experiencers\".\n\nDue to a paucity of objective physical evidence, most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false memory syndrome), personality, sleep paralysis, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors\". However, the late Prof. John E. Mack, a respected Harvard University psychiatrist, devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was posttraumatic stress disorder. As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred.\n\nSkeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars, and some of those reported to have actually abducted people.\n\nTypical claims involve being subjected to a forced medical examination that emphasizes their reproductive system. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons. While many of these claimed encounters are described as terrifying, some have been viewed as pleasurable or transformative.\n\nThe first alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States. The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.\n\nAlien abductions have been the subject of conspiracy theories and science fiction storylines (notably The X-Files) that have speculated on stealth technology required if the phenomenon were real, the motivations for secrecy, and that alien implants could be a possible form of physical evidence.", "title": "TWO UFOS CAUGHT ON TAPE GOVERNMENT COVERUP REVEALED", "publishedDate": "2014-04-15T01:43:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWTwkjjKFCw", "description": "eNCA hosted the first of its Great Debates at Wits last night\nSubscribe to eNCA for latest news.

Over the past four months of my time here at Ryerson University I have taken advantage of the available darkrooms. I have attempted and succeeded in some of the old techniques that past masters such as Man Ray and Ansel Adams used in the past. Of course I have not made images that hold up to their expertise at this point in time, but I have explored the techniques none the less. It has been a great journey spending time in the darkroom. I have learnt many things about analog photography, some of which I never could have dreamed learning. \n\n This Photo essay however is about thoughts I have about the darkroom rather than a denotation of what a darkroom is. Still, I have much more to think about, in terms of what I think of the darkroom after so many hours spent in such a place. It is a dark and lonely place, because of this you can't help but think about what it was like for pioneers of the darkroom when it was used and manipulated so many years ago, and what they thought of the place when they used it.  \n\n What I've come to believe about the darkroom is that it is a great teacher of the past of photography. The learning curve in the darkroom teaches patience, and that gratification is earned, not given. It is a complex and scientific medium of photography in comparison to digital photography. Something that has more worth in comparison to digital photography, soley due to the fact that you need technical knowledge. This separates the consumerists, from the artists. At least that's what I used to think in the beginning of my pursuit of the darkroom. This doesn't mean that I necessarily believe the darkroom is played out or over done; on the contrary, I think that with enough looking there can be a new element that has not yet been discovered.\n\n From the experiences in the darkroom I now have a better understanding of a fundamental element of photography, light. This lesson I think should be explored thoroughly by the image makers of the present. But I feel as though it isn't. Day in and day out I have been in the darkroom exploring its potential, and I see almost nobody from first year other than a friend of mine. Of course there is always the odd few, but it is rare. \n It has been a great experience in the darkroom, and I will miss it very much over the summer. Except I don't know that I will spend as much time in the darkroom next year, I think it may be time to explore the digital realm with a closer eye. The skills I have gathered from the darkroom have already started to transfer into the digital darkroom, and this of course is the same in vice versa. For instance the majority of my time in the darkroom has been exploring the solarisation techniques of Man Ray. From these experiences I have been able to apply them on my computer, which is much easier to achieve in comparison to doing it in the darkroom. With that in mind I have come to believe that reproducing the old aesthetic of darkroom photography is too redundant of an action. The digital medium is not the same as analog photography, and should therefore create images that represent a new aesthetic. Since I have only begun to really explore the digital darkroom I have little to say. The final frame of the video is a closing to where I stand now to this day. It is a detail of a solarized negative that I have solarized on my computer, over and over again until the data created a cubism stylized image. It is best to view the image printed due to the fact that you can walk up close and see the shapes (seen in the final image of the video), and then step back and see what the shapes create.\n\nEnjoy.", "title": "Darkroom", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T01:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWbxwiZXjQs", "description": "Introduction to Natural Sisal Installation", "title": "Introduction to Natural Sisal Installation", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T05:17:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWcB8G8d4jA", "description": "a look at scarface and the ventriloquist  from batman the animated series", "title": "Batman - Arkham Files Ventriloquist & Scarface", "publishedDate": "2012-11-19T18:47:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWcUmezMFfI", "description": "It a sad day to see such talent at such a young age retire due to injurys, I thought this would happen to Oden 1st but like I said very sad!\n\nThankyou for watching, don't forget to Subscribe!!\n\nLike this video if you think Brandon Roy was a awesome player!", "title": "Portland Trail Blazers Brandon Roy Announces Retirement", "publishedDate": "2011-12-11T19:34:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWccc6ZCRDo", "description": "Check out our official website: http://us.tomonews.net/\nCheck out our Android app: http://goo.gl/PtT6VD\nCheck out our iOS app:  http://bit.ly/1gO3z1f\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nAn Italian man died after he was suckerpunched outside a bodega last Friday in New York.\n\nOliver D'Orio, 37, had a Swiss passport and was visiting his girlfriend in the Bronx. He went to the Guerrero Bodega on Washington Avenue and East 184th Street around 11:30 p.m. Video from security cameras show him chatting with customers, including 19-year-old Brownie Lopez.\n\nD'Orio was badgering customers, asking them to buy him a beer, according to reports. He walked away from the bodega only to come back with his shirt off and approach Lopez in an intimidating manner.\n\nWhile D'Orio was looking away, Lopez hit him with an open hand. D'Orio appeared to be knocked unconscious by the blow. He fell backward and smashed his head on the pavement. \n\nThe shop owner called 911. Paramedics arrived 30 minutes later, and D'Orio was pronounced dead at the hospital. \n\nLopez turned himself in to authorities at the 48th Precinct in the Bronx. He was charged with assault, as police believe Lopez did not intend to kill the man.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

Che Guevara was a racist. Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent, so he should inform himself on the guy that he's propping up.\" \n\n\"Secondly, I think if Jay-Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba, he would have met people that are being oppressed, including a hip-hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics,\" Rubio added. \"And I think he missed an opportunity.

The rapper responded to the criticism last week with a new rap, titled \"Open Letter.\"  \n\nBut Rubio, a Cuban-American, said Sunday that the real problem was not Jay-Z, but the current U.S. travel policy to the island. \n\n\"The bigger point is the travel policies,\" he told ABC's Jon Karl. \"The travel policies need to be tightened because they are being abused,\" Rubio said. \"These are tourist trips, and they are \u2014 what they're doing is providing hard currency and funding so that a tyrannical regime can maintain its grip on the island of Cuba, and I think that's wrong.\"\n\nCredit: Grace Wyler", "title": "Marco Rubio: Jay-Z Needs to Get Informed on Cuba", "publishedDate": "2013-04-15T08:38:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWfvGiMXmAw", "description": "Here is the best dunker in high school, 6\u20192\u2033 Kwe Parker, showing out for the last 2 seasons.", "title": "Kwe Parker Is The BEST Dunker In High School!

Calla seed pods are usually dark green after they are formed. The seed pods need to stay on the plant as long as possible to insure viable seeds and good germination rates. As the seed pod matures and the seeds become viable the pods turns color. The color can vary from gold, yellow, orange, brown and sometimes light green. The individual parts of the seed pod hold the seeds and will get mushy or soft when they are ready. Over time the pods turn light brown and will split open. In cooler climates the plant can die back before this happens. The pods when picked before frost or a freeze will dry to a light brown color and may or may not split open. The seeds are easier to harvest from the pods that are fully dried, but can be harvested anytime after they become soft or mushy.  Seeds removed before the pods are dry need to be washed in a strainer to clean the seeds and then dried. Normally the pods need about 45 to 60 days to dry our completely after they are removed from the plant. Seeds do better if planted at the time you remove them or they can be stored in a cool dry place until later. The longer you wait the lower germination rate.

They are solitary insects that build nests out of mud in sheltered locations, frequently on man-made structures such as bridges, barns, open porches or under the eaves of houses. These nests are not aggressively defended, and stings are rare.\nSee my bird videos....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_EQrfKQkM\n\nThe black and yellow mud dauber's nest is comprised of a series of cylindrical cells that are plastered over to form a smooth nest that may attain nearly the size of a human fist. After building a cell, the female wasp captures several spiders. The captured prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest, and then a single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell. The wasp then seals the cell with mud. After finishing a series of cells, she leaves and does not return. Eventually, the hatching larva will eat the prey and emerge from the nest.", "title": "Mud dauber making nest", "publishedDate": "2008-09-07T02:06:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWrAioqfypA", "description": "", "title": "C\u00f3mo manchar el interior de una casa de madera", "publishedDate": "2014-04-02T12:44:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWrEfczSNE8", "description": "BYU engineering students have developed a \"Batman\"-like grappling hook device for the United States Air Force.", "title": "\"Batman\" grappling hook developed by BYU students", "publishedDate": "2012-04-13T19:13:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWrHcNKsj5Q", "description": "http://waagacusub.com - Fanaanada Farax Kaftan ayaa soo wada hees cusub oo la magacbaxday Xildhibaan,waxaa heesta sameeyay Abwaanad Xaliimo Koronto", "title": "Fanaanada Farax Kaftan iyo hordhaca hees Xildhibaan", "publishedDate": "2014-05-15T19:50:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWrJ84eO-lQ", "description": "\"All my Life is about God, Love and Music ,and I share all of this from Time to Time through my Songs \" | EdwardMaya.\nManagement&Licensing : office@edwardmaya.com \nhttps://www.facebook.com/EdwardMayaOfficial\nhttp://www.edwardmaya.com\nhttp://www.mayavinrecords.com", "title": "Angel of Happiness by Edward Maya (Track3)  Meditation & Spiritual Music", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T17:20:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BWrYrLDbmhc", "description": "Some Leathernecks from 4th Anglico caught this guy recently at a funeral.

El tronco suele ser corto y grueso, con ramas abundantes. Forma una copa irregular, abierta y clara.\nLas hojas son simples, alternas, pecioladas, de forma trasovada a oblonga y l\u00f3bulos irregulares que no pasan la mitad del limbo (en el rebollo Quercus pyrenaica, las hendiduras de los l\u00fabulos pueden llegar casi hasta el nervio central). De consistencia semicori\u00e1cea, el color es verde intenso y mate.\nLas flores masculinas se agrupan en amentos que salen en los brotes del a\u00f1o. Las femeninas en grupos de 2 a 3 sobre un ped\u00fanculo largo.\nEl fruto es una bellota que se asienta sobre el ped\u00fandulo (a diferencia del otro roble, Quercus petraea, en el que las bellotas son sentadas en la ramilla). Son grandes, lisas con estr\u00edas oscuras y \u00e1pice deprimido. La c\u00fapula es corta (menos de la mitad de la bellota) y tiene escamas planas.\nSu reproducci\u00f3n se hace por semilla.\nEn la naturaleza se da en terrenos profundos, sueltos y frescos, con preferencia sobre sustrato sil\u00edceo.\nEn jardiner\u00eda se usa como \u00e1rbol de porte. Es una especie r\u00fastica pero necesita humedad en verano. Soporta heladas fuertes.\n\nM\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre EL ROBLE (Quercus robur) en:http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es", "title": "EL ROBLE: Quercus robur (http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-21T17:02:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX-CHn7dU3c", "description": "Jean-Christophe Agosta est un coureur ultrafond et aussi un carabinier du prince Albert II.

Shut them up by making yourself look like the meanest, greenest mother on the block.\n\n\nStep 1: Wear a dirty outfit\nWear an outfit that looks like it hasn\u2019t been washed in weeks. Tell your carbon-neutral cohorts you\u2019ve just gotten back from an early morning tree planting ceremony.\n\nTip\nPut an Earth Day countdown button on your website to show your excitement. You can get one at \"www.earthday.net\":http://www.earthday.net.\n\nStep 2: Drink green tea lattes\nDrink green tea lattes and mention how you\u2019re planning to go totally 'locavore' in honor of this special day--that\u2019s eco-lingo for eating locally grown food. When no one\u2019s looking, go to McDonalds and eat a cow.\n\nStep 3: Pretend to be biking to work\nWhen your smug pals call your cell to ask what you\u2019re doing to lessen your carbon footprint, breath heavily and say you can\u2019t hear them because you\u2019re biking up a hill on your way to work. Then step on the gas.\n\nStep 4: Spam your friends with petitions\nSpam all your friends with the link to an Earth Day petition. Put 'Urgent' in the title of the email.\n\nStep 5: Show your sticker\nPut a sticker on your shirt, and when your friends ask you for an Earth Day donation, point to it.

She has been seen by a vet orthopaedic specialist, who confirmed this video. She has bilateral grade 2 luxating patellas - at the moment the left is worse than the right. Surgery has been recommended to prevent long term arthritis (as the wrongly tracking kneecap will chip away at the underlying cartilage) though it is not currently an urgent matter.\n\nIn this video, she was trying to run up the driveway, something she usually does with no problem. Here, she stopped and kept still (VERY unusual for her), which enabled me to get my phone to capture it, so I could show my vet. In other instances, when she might be running or pouncing, her leg lifts and 'locks' but it will only last 2-3 seconds whereupon it clicks back into place and looks more like she is briefly 'hopping' on three legs.\n\nIt had previously only been happening on the right, but after a mishap with a leash getting twisted and yanking her left leg (she'd suddenly started play pouncing on a very excited puppy while both were on leashes), the left is the greater problem. She can fix the dislocation herself on the right, but on the left, I often have to pick her up, bend her leg and clunk it back in (as I had to do here).", "title": "Japanese Spitz luxating patella dislocated kneecap", "publishedDate": "2013-05-17T04:09:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX2MhUaWSzk", "description": "TRAIN+HUNT+FILM and MORE at www.ZACGRIFFITH.com\n\nAwesome shot on an AWESOME ram.", "title": "GIANT AOUDAD KILL SHOT", "publishedDate": "2014-06-07T19:32:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX2Trl8LJuY", "description": "Q.ZHOU scored four 4 points throws in this repechage match.", "title": "Female Wrestling 75 kg - Q.ZHOU (CHN) vs Y.ADAR (TUR) - Tashkent World Championship 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-12T06:50:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX2kc_wHF0o", "description": "ya estaba bien perro cansado jajajajajaja", "title": "berzelius(GOGO CANSADO) nation leon gto.", "publishedDate": "2009-04-06T16:10:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX2qCpRxilM", "description": "This lovingly crafted April Fools' trailer features the famed leader of the Autobots, a new Titan ability, and a new melee weapon!", "title": "Optimus Prime in Titanfall -- IGN Originals DLC Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T18:54:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BX2vrQ7G17A", "description": "Greg Ondo from Steinberg shows off the Padshop granular synthesizer that comes with Cubase 6.5 DAW software.

This can be done using a quad helix appliance, which will widen your jaws to create room for alignment of your teeth. The quad helix is adjusted periodically over time to create room.\n\nA quad helix can be more gentle than a rapid palatal expander, which makes it especially good for young children. It does not need to be adjusted with a screw, making maintenance easier.\n\nDr. Ashouri & her staff provide general orthodontic care to adults and children in a warm, state-of-the-art environment. They provide services for dental problems such as crooked teeth, crowding, spacing, overbite, underbite, and thumb-sucking using clear braces, Invisalign, and lingual braces. For children ages 7-10 years, early orthodontic treatment can be beneficial by lessening the susceptibility of front teeth injury, avoiding or reducing the need for teeth extraction in the future, and using this optimal time of growth to the best of their advantage. Dr. Ashouri is certified by the American Board of Orthodontics. She works closely with her patients' general dentist so that orthodontist, dentist, and patient can all work together to ensure perfect orthodontic results.

Es kann mit Sicherheit gesagt werden, dass diese \u00fcber einer alten romanischen Kirche erstellt wurde. Hausen als Kirchendorf ist damit wesentlich \u00e4lter. Das Gotteshaus hat eine wechselvolle Geschichte hinter sich. Vom Aussehen und der Bauart der 1401 geweihten Kirche wei\u00df man leider nicht sehr viel. Vermutlich war es zuerst nur ein einfacher Holzbau, der nach und nach ausgebaut wurde. Der Turm war mit Schindeln gedeckt, das Innere wurde zwischen 1670 und 1700 neu gestaltet. 1707/10 hat man, wegen der Bauf\u00e4lligkeit, an gleicher Stelle eine neue Kirche errichtet, wobei die Inneneinrichtung von der vorherigen Kirche \u00fcbernommen wurde. 1711 lieferte der kurf\u00fcrstliche Glockengie\u00dfer Langenegger in M\u00fcnchen zwei Glocken. 1815 brannte die Kirche bis auf die Grundmauern ab. 1822 wurde wiederum eine Kirche errichtet. Die heutige Inneneinrichtung stammt aus den Jahren 1880/1881. Der Hochaltar wird bestimmt durch die beiden Bilder links und rechts des Tabernakels. Auf dem einen ist die Verk\u00fcndigung Marias dargestellt, auf dem anderen die Geburt Jesu. Darunter befinden sich die Medaillons mit den Symbolen der vier Evangelisten. \u00dcber allem thront eine Kirchenkuppel als Symbol f\u00fcr den Petersdom. Umrahmt wird das Ganze von vier schlanken, gotischen Spitzt\u00fcrmen. Die Kreuzwegstationen stammen aus der Zeit um 1860. Die Hausener Glocken mussten am 27. Juni 1916 abgeliefert werden. Als Ersatz erhielt die Kirche erstaunlicherweise bald Stahlglocken (Nominale fis'', a'') der Firma Schilling u. Lattermann aus Apolda, die am 27.

This is cited in the Skanda Puran. The sentiment here is that the uncontrolled indriyas are only conquered by the Lord's Shakti.\n2) On this day Lord Ram vanquished Ravan. Therefore people celebrate the Lord's victory by burning Ravan's effigy on this day.\n3) Dhaumya rishi's son, Mahaar married Shami, daughter of Aarva rishi, of Malwa. After marriage both were on their way to have darshan and blessings of Shaunak rishi. On the way they met Bhrachundi rishi who had a trunk on his head. Seeing this the two made fun of him. The rishi cursed them and both turned into trees. For succor both prayed to Ganeshji. He blessed them that they would be offered worship. From this day people offer pujan to the Mahaar tree and Shami tree (commonly known as 'Khijdo', Latin-Prosopis spicigera ). This pujan is considered to be as fruitful as Shiv's pujan. \n4) The Skand Puran (2/8/5) also cites another story. Kautsa, the poor pupil of Vishwamitra rishi, approached Raghu Raja for wealth, to gift his guru. However Raghu Raja had already spent all his wealth to prepare a Vishwajit yagna. However so that Kautsa would not have to leave empty-handed, he raided Kuber - the treasurer of the devas, on this day. The defeated Kuber sprinkled 14 crore (14x107) gold coins on the Shami tree. Kautsa gathered and gifted them to his guru. In turn, Vishwamitra gifted these to the poor. Henceforth, the leaves of the Shami are symbolically equivalent to gold for purposes of pujan. Since the Shami tree gifted wealth, people perform its pujan on this day. \n5) On this day, Arjun picked up his weapons hidden on the Shami tree, to battle with Duryodhan in order to retrieve Virat Raja's cows from him. \n\nRitual\n\n\nPeople offer pujan to weapons and vehicles. They also perform 'Sharda pujan' - of books. The latter is symbolic of conquest over one's self. \n\nPeople embark on all forms of auspicious ventures on this day, without the need to consider the auspicious time in the 'panchaang.' \nStudents offer pujan to Saraswati, the goddess of learning. \nTraditionally, 'jalebi' (sweet made from plain flour and ghee) and 'fafda' (made from gram flour) with 'chutney' are offered to the Lord and devotees avail of this prasad. These food items balance the 'pitta' humour, of the 3 humours in the body. For, during and after Bhadarva, 'pitta' usually increases, which leads to various illnesses. Therefore the above foods of sugar and ghee balance 'pitta'.\n \n  \n\n\nImport \nThe root sentiment of Vijaya Dashmi is victory; of good over evil and of self over one's mundane indriyas. Man forever wishes to be victorious over others and over creation. Moreover, the triumph of victory leads him to luxury and extravagance. These then ruin him. Therefore the scriptures advise us to attain victory over the mind. One who has not conquered the mind has not conquered anything. Even the stalwarts were subdued by their whims. Vishwamitra succumbed to Menka, Yudhisthir to gambling. Therefore the Gita (2/60) proclaims that even intellectuals who strive to control their minds are defeated by their indriyas and swayed towards sensual pleasures. Chanakya also revealed to emperor Chandragupta Maurya: 'The gist of the scriptures is to attain victory over the indriyas.'\n\nIn the 'Maniratnamala', Shankaracharya has stipulated:\nJitam jagat kena, mano hi yena. \n\ni.e. One who has conquered his mind has conquered the world. For this, one needs to imbibe Dharma. Throughout the Mahabharat, sage Ved Vyas reiterates that:\n'Yato Dharmastato jayaha' \n   \n  i.e. Where there is Dharma, there is victory.\nAnd where there is God there is Dharma. A common idiom associated with Dashera is that, 'One's horse should be able to run on this day' (if not during other times of the year). To ensure that our 'horse' (our life) does not collapse on Dashera, the scriptures advocate taking refuge in the God-realised Satpurush and to sincerely obey his commands.\nThe true Vijaya Dashmi is in consolidating this sentiment in our lives.", "title": "dasara , Vijaya Dashmi", "publishedDate": "2007-10-21T13:19:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BXbov_hw738", "description": "le dernier clip de \"..Silence\", groupe rock venu de Rennes.", "title": "clip Aveu d'impuissance par \"...Silence\"", "publishedDate": "2011-02-03T08:58:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BXcZMoavNn0", "description": "New Track KAMIKAZI ! : http://youtu.be/5P0f0dPlrek\n\nDOWNLOAD :http://facebook.com/TheOfficialVOMIT\n\nI am not Martin Garrix and am not in any way affiliated with Martin Garrix or Spinnin' Records\nThis track is served here Solely as a tribute and nothing more.\n\nFurthermore, this track does not contain any samples from Martin Garrix's song\nand was done from scratch as a personal challenge.\ni will not use this song commercially and i will not use it on any of my live sets\ndue to the obvious similarities between the two tracks.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/VomitOfficial", "title": "VOMIT - BREAK THE ICE (A Tribute To Martin Garrix)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T13:38:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BXd4zM2xzN0", "description": "", "title": "Risi e Bisi con..

I prefer one that is a two piece kit. It's got a two inch diameter, maybe twelve to twenty-four inch tube, connected to a five-eighths or three-quarter inch flexible hose that's maybe four to eight feet long that goes into a bucket. You want to get a siphon started whether you suck on the hose or you use a little pump starter. You want to get the water siphoning from the aquarium into the bucket. \n\nAnd that gravel cleaner is going to free up a lot of the trapped detritus, fecal matter, food, waste, anything that's been accumulating in the gravel bed. And even if the gravel looks clean, trust me, it's got a lot of stuff lurking in it. Now that doesn't mean that it's really bad for the aquarium. Most of it, as it dissolves, is being broken down by food bacteria in the aquarium. But eventually it's going to get to the point where the gravel is so clogged that the water can no longer move through the gravel bed allowing the bacteria to get the oxygen it needs to be able to break down the waste. \n\nSo the goal is to remove a lot of the waste from the gravel bed so water can travel through it allowing the bacteria access to oxygen, water, and the waste. So every three to four weeks when you do your water change you want to siphon the gravel bed. I like to remove some of the decorations first. Put them in a bucket of hot water. And then siphon the gravel while changing fifteen to twenty five percent of the water. \n\nIt's good to clean your filter on the off week when you're not cleaning your gravel so you minimize shock to the aquarium. But just go through the gravel bed. Start in one corner and do a grid pattern just like you would vacuum a floor so you hit every square inch of the gravel bed. \n\nKeep an eye on the bucket so you don't overflow the bucket. You can dump that water right down your toilet or right into your sink. If there's no gravel in it it's fine to dump down the drain. \n\nAnd then when you refill the water just make sure you use dechlorinators. It's good to let the water sit overnight if you can so it de-gases. But you can use dechlorinators. And make sure the pH is the same so you minimize the fluctuations in pH which could be lethal to certain fish or any fish it's stressful on. Just go the extra distance. Make sure the temperature and the pH is matched to the existing water.\n\nThat's it. It's very, very straightforward. And it's actually somewhat curiously satisfying to gravel clean. I don't know what it is about it but it's like therapy.

Flocks of these birds are found in grasslands, cultivated areas, scrub and secondary growth and they are best known for their hanging retort shaped nests woven from leaves. These nest colonies are usually found on thorny trees or palm fronds and the nests are often built near water or hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily. They are widespread and common within their range but are prone to local, seasonal movements mainly in response to rain and food availability.\n\nAmong the population variations, three subspecies are recognized. The nominate race philippinus is found through much of mainland India while burmanicus is found eastwards into Southeast Asia. The population in southwest India is darker above and referred to as subspecies travancoreensis.\n\nThese are sparrow-sized (15 cm) and in their non-breeding plumage, both males and females resemble female house sparrows. They have a stout conical bill and a short square tail. Non-breeding males and females look alike, dark brown streaked fulvous buff above, plain (unstreaked) whitish fulvous below, eyebrow long and buff coloured, bill is horn coloured and no mask. Breeding males have a bright yellow crown, dark brown mask, blackish brown bill, upper parts are dark brown streaked with yellow, with a yellow breast and cream buff below.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Healthy fats help boost brainpower and even flip your body's fat-storage switch \"off\". \n\nStock your pantry with these heat stable, REAL fats for delicious baked goods with benefits:\n\nCoconut oil provides rich, buttery flavor. Also slow to oxidize and resistant to rancidity. \n\nPalm Shortening: Another great alternative to traditional shortenings (that contain trans fat) can help you achieve the tender flakiness that you like in crusts, cookies.\n\nButter: When it comes to baking, it's hard to beat the taste of real butter. But choose organic, pastured butter that contains no hormones and the healthy fat, CLA.\n\nUse Macadamia Nut Oil, Almond Oil. They're rich in inflammation-fighting, belly-flattening monounsaturated fat. \n\nAVOID wrong fats.\n\nClick below for how to make any dessert into a healthy\nfat burning version that will make you slimmer and leaner!\n\nhttp://www.instantfacelifttape.com/healthy-desserts\nhttp://youtu.be/BXtQSmuYkUM\n\nThanks for watching!", "title": "Healthy Desserts- Stay Slim Using the Right Fats (for Your Non Fattening Desserts recipe)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-27T07:24:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "BXtXMbt_Q5g", "description": "el prisma de lasers que cambiaba de color y la pantalla psicod\u00e9lica. y el exceso de humo tambi\u00e9n.\n\nUn agradecimiento especial a Gustavo y a su padre.\n\nPD:\ncuando empezaba a extra\u00f1ar estar en el campo, apareci\u00f3 la baranda a marihuana que me hizo entrar en ambiente. no s\u00e9 como habr\u00e1 estado la cosa ahi atras.", "title": "Roger Waters - A.C.Y.L.
