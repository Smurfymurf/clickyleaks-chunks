Everything you need right here...accept the plant. How to grow this carnivorous plant in 3 minutes. Care tips, temp tips, winter tips.\nCarnivorous plants are plants that derive some or most of their nutrients (but not energy) from trapping and consuming animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings. Charles Darwin wrote Insectivorous Plants, the first well-known treatise on carnivorous plants, in 1875.[4]\n\nTrue carnivory is thought to have evolved independently six times in five different orders of flowering plants,[5][6] and these are now represented by more than a dozen genera. These include about 630 species that attract and trap prey, produce digestive enzymes, and absorb the resulting available nutrients.[7] Additionally, over 300 protocarnivorous plant species in several genera show some but not all these characteristics.\nThe only two active snap traps\u2014the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and the waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa)\u2014are believed to have had a common ancestor with similar adaptations. Their trapping mechanism has also been described as a \"mouse trap\", \"bear trap\" or \"man trap\", based on their shape and rapid movement. However, the term snap trap is preferred as other designations are misleading, particularly with respect to the intended prey. Aldrovanda is aquatic and specialised in catching small invertebrates; Dionaea is terrestrial and catches a variety of arthropods, including spiders.[12]\n\nThe traps are very similar, with leaves whose terminal section is divided into two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells at the base of the trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib.[13] These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth.[14] The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut,[13] flipping rapidly from convex to concave[15] and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.[citation needed]\n\nThe snapping of the leaves is a case of thigmonasty (undirected movement in response to touch). Further stimulation of the lobe's internal surfaces by the struggling insects causes the lobes to close even tighter (thigmotropism), sealing the lobes hermetically and forming a stomach in which digestion occurs over a period of one to two weeks. Leaves can be reused three or four times before they become unresponsive to stimulation, depending on the growing conditions.", "title": "The Venus Flytrap / How to Grow a Venus FlyTrap : Everything you need to know in 3 minutes.", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T21:36:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2n_B0cfiFgU", "description": "This patient education video explains ulcerative colitis and how it can be treated.

That said, after the third layer, more confetti = more unevenness on the outside of the bowl. \n\n+HOW LONG DID YOU LET THEM DRY?\nIn total, I allowed both bowls to dry for about 12 hours. Just wanted to make sure they were 100% dry.\n\n+WHY DIDN'T YOU ADD A FINAL LAYER OF MOD PODGE TO SMOOTH EVERYTHING DOWN?\nI attempted this on a small portion of one of the bowls, but unfortunately, the mod podge does not get the confetti to lay flat. Instead of smoothing it out, it added to the chunky, uneven texture on the outside. \n\n+FINAL VERDICT:\nThis was half truth/half fail (in my opinion). It does create a bowl, but the outside of the bowl is kind of uneven/sad looking. I'd be really curious to try this with a different type of material to see how it works (fabric, maybe?).

Licensed by VISCOPY, Australia\n\nThe Warlpiri-speaking community of Yuendumu lies approximately 100 kilometres north of Papunya in the Northern Territory. It was established in 1946 by the Australian government to deliver rations and welfare services to Aboriginal people in the surrounding district. Yuendumu was the first Aboriginal community in the Western Desert region to begin painting for the art market, after Papunya. Senior Warlpiri men knew of developments at Papunya in the 1970s, but were reluctant to paint for the public domain. In the early 1980s, the first artists at Yuendumu to produce paintings were Warlpiri women. Then, in 1983, a group of senior men including Paddy Sims, Larry Spencer and Paddy Nelson, painted the 30 doors of the local school with Jukurrpa images to remind the students of their traditional education. The project encouraged this senior group and other Warlpiri artists to paint on canvas on a large scale for exhibition. Within two years they had established their own art centre, Warlukurlangu Artists.\n\nYanjilypiri Jukurrpa (Star Dreaming) 1985 is one of the first large canvases to emerge from Yuendumu. This magnificent work by three senior Warlpiri men relates to the fire ceremony of the Warlpiri, and is associated with the creation of the constellations. While the artists remained circumspect about the deeper levels of interpretation of the imagery, they described the dominant central motif as a ceremonial ground painting upon which the Fire Ceremony is performed. Participants shake smouldering branches and the embers float into the night sky to create the constellations represented by the circles and stars surrounding the ground painting. In turn, the ground painting can be seen as an evocation of the earth.\n\nA feature of Yuendumu paintings is that many are produced collaboratively. Contributors are involved as either kirda (owners of the Jukurrpa through the patrilineal line) or as kurdungurlu (managers of the Jukurrpa through the matrilineal line). Jimija Jungurrayi Spencer (1908--1989), the owner of the Star Dreaming, supervised this painting but did not participate. The main painter was Paddy Nelson who had matrilineally-inherited rights to the Dreaming. Paddy Sims and Jimija's younger brother, Larry Spencer, assisted.\n\nFranchesca Cubillo\n\nText \u00a9 National Gallery of Australia, Canberra 2010 \nFrom: Franchesca Cubillo and Wally Caruana (eds) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art: collection highlights National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 2010", "title": "110 53999 -  Paddy Jupurrurla Nelson 'Yanjilypiri Jukurrpa (Star Dreaming)'  1985", "publishedDate": "2010-12-16T13:55:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nh7thXwmrw", "description": "Artist: Octad\nAlbum: Unreleased Archive - part 1\nLabel: Concrete Records\nCat: cnc004\nRelease date: 28/01/2011", "title": "OCTAD - UNRELEASED ARCHIVE part 1", "publishedDate": "2011-01-22T08:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nhl5UYWmyk", "description": "Corto realizado por alumnos de tercer a\u00f1o de la Licenciatura en Comunicaci\u00f3n de la Universidad Austral, para la materia Taller de Realizaci\u00f3n Audiovisual, estrenado en el marco de la NOCHE DE LAS ESTRELLAS 2011.", "title": "FC Austral - Cortos 2011 - Sangre de tu sangre", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T16:50:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nhuG5K3X9M", "description": "545 0285 Bronze statuette (Helen of Troy?) from Sparta, Greece", "title": "0545 0285 Bronze statuette (Helen of Troy?) from Sparta, Greece", "publishedDate": "2009-03-29T05:27:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2niBtac8m6A", "description": "\u60f3\u50cf\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b2\u306b\u3073\u3063\u304f\u308a\u3002\u307b\u307c\u7121\u6bd2\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b2\u306a\u306e\u3067\u89e6\u3063\u3066\u3082\uff2f\uff2b\u3002\u9632\u6c34\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u30c7\u30b8\u30ab\u30e1\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u64ae\u5f71\u3002", "title": "Jellyfish lake , palau HD\u3000\u3001\u3000\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u3000\u30d1\u30e9\u30aa", "publishedDate": "2011-10-23T13:29:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2niLcIUmq5U", "description": "Faranjit Tedavisi, Sin\u00fczit, Bademcik iltihab\u0131, Orta Kulak iltihab\u0131, Tonsilit, ibrahim G\u00f6k\u00e7ek, http://www.dogaltedavi.net, http://www.bitkiseltedavi.com, Do\u011fal Tedavi, Bitkisel Tedavi, Bitkisel \u00dcr\u00fcnler, Bitkisel \u00c7\u00f6z\u00fcmler, \u015eifa Diyar\u0131, \u015eifa A\u011fac\u0131, \u015eifa Market, Alternatif T\u0131p, \u015eifal\u0131 Bitkiler,  Bitkisel \u015eifa, Hastal\u0131klar, \u0130la\u00e7lar, Bitkisel \u0130la\u00e7, Hekim, Herbalist, Doktor, Kronik, Akut, Do\u011fadan, Do\u011fa, Eczane, Deva, Aromaterapi, Fitoterapi, Homeopati, Cemre Ab\u0131 Hayat, Cemre Bitkisel, \u015eifa,", "title": "Faranjit Tedavisi, Sin\u00fczit, Bademcik iltihab\u0131, Orta Kulak iltihab\u0131, Tonsilit", "publishedDate": "2013-06-13T15:23:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nifSQ1tQDA", "description": "Wypowiedzi pochodz\u0105 z filmu \"\u017bycie wymyka si\u0119 spod kontroli - 2004\"", "title": "GMO - Bardzo Wysoki Koszt Nasion", "publishedDate": "2012-02-04T16:51:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2njIO6o9Ifg", "description": "", "title": "Developpement embryonnaire", "publishedDate": "2008-12-03T14:40:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2njgg4vXZ14", "description": "Fibre Optic Broadband is the Internet accelerated, so you can do more and you can do it faster, whether you're at home or at work.\n\nWith our Fibre Optic Broadband you'll get an internet service that's eight times faster than the UK average, with no traffic management or fair usage policy to limit your service.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nVelvet Red Swordtails are TROPICAL FRESH WATER FISH (Xiphophorus hellerii in family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes). A live-bearer, it is closely related to the southern platyfish or \"platy\" (X. maculatus) and can interbreed with it. It is native to an area of North and Central America stretching from Veracruz, Mexico, to northwestern Honduras.", "title": "Pondscape.us - Feeding The Aquatic Puppies", "publishedDate": "2010-01-16T13:00:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nu7i6X3fqA", "description": "oscar cardozo\nEmege sayg\u0131 l\u00fctfen abone olun destek olun...", "title": "trabzonspor vs rostov HD Geni\u015f \u00d6zet goal 2 oscar cardozo 21.08.2014 All Goals and Highlights 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T19:58:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nuEJCk56Bs", "description": "BAMBAN LGU SB MEMBER WILLIAM \"BOYBAO\" SIBAL'S YEARLY PANOCHE BUENA FOR THE INDIGENT PEOPLE OF BAMBAN LAST DEC.24,2008 IN ANUPUL BAMBAN TARLAC ASSISTED BY HIS WIFE EDNA.", "title": "BAMBAN-BOY BAO'S PANOCHE BUENA SA MASA '08", "publishedDate": "2009-01-07T09:57:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nuFd5sTQ4c", "description": "Jellyfish (also known as jellies or sea jellies or Medusozoa) are free-swimming members of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish have several different morphologies that represent several different cnidarian classes including the Scyphozoa (over 200 species), Staurozoa (about 50 species), Cubozoa (about 20 species), and Hydrozoa (about 1000--1500 species that make jellyfish and many more that do not).The jellyfish in these groups are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, stauromedusae, cubomedusae, and hydromedusae. All jellyfish are embodied in the Medusozoa subphylum. Medusa is another word for jellyfish, and as such is used to refer specifically to the adult stage of the life cycle.\n\nJellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. Some hydrozoan jellyfish, or hydromedusae, are also found in fresh water; freshwater species are less than an inch (25 mm) in diameter, are colorless and do not sting. Many of the best-known jellyfish, such as Aurelia, are scyphomedusae. These are the large, often colorful, jellyfish that are common in coastal zones worldwide.\n\nIn its broadest sense, the term jellyfish also generally refers to members of the phylum Ctenophora. Although not closely related to cnidarian jellyfish, ctenophores are also free-swimming planktonic carnivores, are generally transparent or translucent, and exist in shallow to deep portions of all the world's oceans.\nSince jellyfish are not actually fish, the word jellyfish is considered a misnomer, and American public aquariums have popularized use of the terms jellies or sea jellies instead. Others find jellyfish, which has been in common usage for more than a century,to be equally useful and picturesque, and prefer it over jellies. The word jellyfish  is used to denote several different kinds of cnidarians, all of which have a basic body structure that resembles an umbrella, including scyphozoans, staurozoans (stalked jellyfish), hydrozoans, and cubozoans (box jellyfish). Some textbooks and websites refer to scyphozoans as \"true jellyfish\"\n\nIn its broadest usage, some scientists occasionally include members of the phylum Ctenophora (comb jellies) when they are referring to jellyfish.[10] Other scientists prefer to use the more all-encompassing term \"gelatinous zooplankton\", when referring to these, together with other soft-bodied animals in the water column.[11]\n\nA group of jellyfish is sometimes called a bloom or a swarm.[12] \"Bloom\" is usually used for a large group of jellyfish that gather in a small area, but may also have a time component, referring to seasonal increases, or numbers beyond what was expected.[13] Jellyfish are \"bloomy\" by nature of their life cycles, being produced by their benthic polyps usually in the spring when sunshine and plankton increase, so they appear rather suddenly and often in large numbers, even when an ecosystem is in balance.[14] Using \"swarm\" implies some kind of active ability to stay together, which a few species like Aurelia, the moon jelly, demonstrate.[15]\n\nMost jellyfish have a second part of their life cycle, which is called the polyp phase. When single polyps, arising from a single fertilized egg, develop into a multiple-polyp cluster, connected to each other by strands of tissue called stolons, they are said to be \"colonial.\" A few polyps never proliferate and are referred to as \"solitary\" species", "title": "Tiny Umbrella Jellyfish", "publishedDate": "2010-09-28T05:03:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nuUkhoMF1Y", "description": "", "title": "TRANSSEXUAL DAYAMI CRUZ", "publishedDate": "2014-01-13T23:38:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nubSP2FHls", "description": "Highlights of the BYU at Boise State Football Game.", "title": "BYU at Boise State Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-10-25T04:49:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nvnk4cooxU", "description": "Signs Birthday Scene", "title": "Signs Birthday Scene", "publishedDate": "2009-07-30T09:22:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nvpTlIqmMI", "description": "CLIQUEZ SUR L&#39; IMAGE POUR VOIR LA VIDEO\n\n La cave du Ch&acirc;teau de Chenas a organis&eacute;, comme tous les ans, sa &quot;Ronde des Vins&quot;, les 30, 31 mars et 1 avril 2013, un week end sous le signe de la d&eacute;couverte des vins de France et de d&eacute;gustation de vins de Champagne, d&#39;Alsace, de Bourgogne, de Bordeaux, de Languedoc, de C&ocirc;tes du Rh&ocirc;ne, de Provence et naturellement du Beaujolais...

The fact that they additionally remove bilirubin and keep production of this compound stable makes them a useful treatment for jaundice. They can even increase the blood's supply of oxygen and in turn help reduce the red blood cell destruction that jaundice causes.\n\nPiles\nOne of the main causes of piles is constipation and because of its status as roughage which is made up of indigestible carbohydrates radishes can help fight this problem. Radishes can also help with water retention and digestion. Because it is a good detoxifier, a radish can also help quickly reduce symptoms of piles. Consumption of the juice will relieve even more symptoms by soothing the excretory and digestive systems.\n\nUrinary Disorders\nBecause radishes are diuretic by nature, they will increase urine production. They are also an excellent way to help cure burning sensations during urination as well as inflammation. In addition, because they help clean out your kidneys as well as inhibit infections, they help treat various urinary conditions which may be made worse by excess toxins.\n\nWeight Loss\nBecause radishes are incredibly filling, they are a great way to satisfy hunger and keep a low caloric intake. In addition due to their high quantities of roughage, water and low quantities of digestible carbs, they are a great dietary option. Because radishes have a good amount of fiber but a low glycemic index, they can increase the regularity of bowel movements, helping with the metabolism and weight loss.\n\nCancer\nDue to their high levels of vitamin C, anthocyanins and folic as well as detoxifying abilities, radishes are associated with treating several cancers such as oral, stomach, intestinal, kidney and colon. They also contain a great deal of antioxidants and isothiocyanates which alter the cancerous cells' genetic pathways, causing them to die and be incapable of reproducing.\n\n\"Freez Frame Films\" is an Entertainment & Learning channel, which Provides opportunity to comedians, actors, filmmakers, musicians and brands to showcase their talent and stuff all together at one platform.\n\nSubscribe to Freez Frame Films's Youtube Channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/freezframefilms\n\nOfficial Website\nhttp://www.freezframefilms.com/\n\nJoin Us On\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/freezframefilms\nFacebook/Health & Beauty http://goo.gl/bJLldU\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/FreezFrameFilms\n\nGoogle+\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/b/109252552646367222943/109252552646367222943/posts?pageid=109252552646367222943\n\nVisit Freez Frame Films's Dailymotion Channel\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/Freez Frame Films\n\nTags : How-To (Media Genre),Hindi,Freezframefilms,Techniques,Instruction,India,Indian,Beauty,Health,Medical,Benefits,Care,Tips,Popular,Online,Free,English,Help,Tricks,Medicine (Field Of Study),Home,Remedie,Most Viewed,Best,Top,Increase,Remove,Most,Download,Video,Heart,Younger,Cold,Chillin,Food(Industry),Juice,Fruit,Skin,Cough,Digestion,Anti-Biotic,Life,Save,Herbal,Sex,Sweet,Medicine,Lifestyle,Home Remedy (Literature Subject),Cure,Vitamin", "title": "Top 5 Benefits Of Radish | Best Health and Beauty Tips | Lifestyle", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T09:30:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2oDRkj1Olpo", "description": "How to Make Buko Salad the Panlasang Pinoy way.

We're going to show you a cheap and cost effective horse hoof care technique to make hoof oil for those special occasions and how to make hoof oil, such as shows and presenting your horse. To start, you will need some cheap vegetable oil, any vegetable oil will do & some Stockholm tar that you can get from most saddlerys. Always use protective gloves when you're handling these sorts of products.\n\nYou just need to get a little bit of Stockholm tar, add this into the  pot and then we just add some vegetable oil, you can make quite a lot from a very small amount of ingredients. \n\nYou can make quite a lot of hoof oil from a very small amount of ingredients so it's very cost effective. Before applying the oil you need to clean the horses hooves. Once you have cleaned the horses hooves you can apply the homemade hoof oil. You can use the old hoof oil brush to apply the oil .It's really important to check your horses feet at least twice a day and every time you paint their feet.\n\nWhat is always a really good idea is to just brush the hoof with a stiff dandy brush before we put any oil on. You should always want to paint the underneath of the horse's hoof first, right up into the cleft, the frog. Be very careful with horses with lighter color hair. And then you would oil around up to the coronet band.\nThis is a cheap and effective way to paint the horse's hooves and that paint will probably last you all season. So, as you can see, you've got all of this left in your pot, as well as nearly a whole pot of Stockholm tar and vegetable oil is very cheap to buy. So, this will probably last you all year as you're only using it for a show season.", "title": "How to make horse hoof oil with Horsemart's Handy Hints", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T11:48:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2oGZ0CVCuIM", "description": "This stain removal tutorial will show you how to remove deodorant and rust from clothing and fabrics.

Both the chromosphere and the corona have higher temperatures than the photosphere.  How can this be?  One way for gas to become hot is pressure.  Higher pressure and density will lead to higher temperature.  This is what happens in the interior of the Sun, but the corona is a diffuse outer layer far from the Sun's energy source.  How can it be so hot?  Think for example of a fluorescent tube.  In this case a very diffuse gas in the tube is cool to the touch, yet it must have a thermal temperature of thousands of degrees Kelvin because it emits visible light.  The reason is that it is given high energy by electrical fields that are pumped into it from electricity running through the tube.  In the case of the solar corona the energy source is magnetic energy from the Sun's surface and its magnetic field plus convection to carry the energy outward.  The physics of the energy source in the solar corona is complex, but it's clear that magnetic fields fuel the very high temperature of the solar corona.", "title": "Teach Astronomy - Solar Corona", "publishedDate": "2010-07-09T21:14:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2oPRABOn5lc", "description": "In this video i show you and explain the different ways to hook up monitors to an audio interface", "title": "How To: Hook up a Monitors to an Audio Interface", "publishedDate": "2012-07-06T23:33:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2oPhpg61-L4", "description": "Learn to hard reset your blackberry curve 8530 with these easy steps.

The olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous, especially in immature stages of the life cycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or estuarine habitats. Common prey items include jellyfish, tunicates, sea urchins, bryozoans, bivalves, snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. Sphoeroides) and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding . The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources . Captive studies have indicated some level of cannibalistic behavior in this species.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

The line is designed to bond in any combination PVC sheet, metal, magnesite board, OSB board, MDF, particle board and other materials with different types of heaters, for example: XPS, EPS, mineral wool and other one-component polyurethane adhesives with automatic watering. Line is powered from the AC 380V, consumption is less than 3kW.\nThe line is equipped with fixed dosing unit that is used to apply accurately metered amount of one component polyurethane adhesive on substrate automatically.  The dosage of glue is ranged 0-350 g/m2 and rate of application is 0-25 m/min in manual and automatic modes. During the return carriage there is automatic water mist irrigation through nozzles with bronze tips. Adhesive dosing unit is equipped with 2-way pneumatic valves with stop liquid shutter. Valve materials: brass housing; chrome-plated brass ball; brass shaft; P.T.F.E ball sealing.  Automatic shutoff occurs during a power failure or a pause in the operation of the machine for more than 2 minutes, manually -- by pressing the appropriate key on the control panel. The design allows you to work in any mode, without routine service of the dosing unit. The adhesive unit drive lift is equipped with 0.18 kW worm type motor MOTOVARIO. Glue feeding performed by a pump with adjustable shaft speed value in the case of change of adhesive viscosity allows to apply accurately marked (+/-5gr/m2), amount of glue, leveling the difference of its viscosity. This allows you to work with different types of one component polyurethane adhesives in a wide temperature range without reconfiguring the equipment.\n------------------------------------------------\n\u041b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0410\u041c \u2014 SS -1500-1-\u041a-\u041f\u0423 (mod1 \u0438 mod2) \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u044d\u043d\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0447-\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0431\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e, \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0437\u043b\u0430, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 (mod1 \u0441 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043c). \u041b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u041f\u0412\u0425 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u043c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044b, OSB \u043f\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044b, \u0414\u0412\u041f, \u0414\u0421\u041f \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440: \u043f\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0430, \u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0430, \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0440. \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439. \u041f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430 380\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 3\u043a\u0412\u0442.", "title": "SIP Production Line (2 Presses)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-15T19:38:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2obfycl8IFk", "description": "The work of Richard and Linda Welch and Joanne Simpson in Southern Albania.

Then in 2002 she bought Janda, who is now 12.\n\nAfter her first tiger died in 2007 little Saber -- who was only two weeks old at the time -- was introduced to the family.\n\nJanice, who lives in \u00adDavenport, Florida, says: \"They pretty much look at me as being their mother. As far as I'm concerned they are my big four-legged furry kids.\n\n\"We have a very special bond -- they rub my face and let me kiss them on the nose, we can cuddle with them and hug them.\"\n\nAfter a full day of play and feeding, Janice lies down with the tigers to help them go to sleep. She says: \"I don't know of too many places where you can cuddle with a full grown tiger and we've been doing this with them for years.\" Janice and husband David work around the clock to care for the tigers and spend all of their income on food and care.\n\nThey are fed three times from 1pm to 11pm and the 60ft by 40ft enclosure needs to be cleaned several times a day. Janice says: \"We have to travel an hour north for Janda's horse meat once a week and an hour south for Saber's beef.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees with people having two man-eating tigers in their back garden.\n\nBut Janice says: \"It is not the ideal place for a tiger to be in a cage but at this point in the wild there isn't a lot of hope for them any more. If there aren't some left in cages there aren't going to be any left at all in a couple of years. Our mission here has always been to try to bring people closer together with these tigers -- to build a connection and help save the wild tigers before it's too late.\"", "title": "Florida woman Janice Haley Keeps Two Bengal Tigers In Her Garden As Ordinary Pets!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T06:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ogy-DszZPA", "description": "Scripted disorientation, or the Gruen Transfer in a minute or so - what it is, why you should care, what you can do about it, related concepts.

In this gym, we call it the Marecelotine.  It's a very , very innovative, excellent technique and requires almost no power.  It's all technique, great move.  We're going to do it from the guard, but it can be done from a number of different positions, all right?  Break down his posture, I grab his neck, and I finish.  One more time, I'm going to break it down.  So, I'm going to break his posture somehow, either pull him in this way, or I can come up, very likely I come up for a sweep, sit my butt back, and I'm going to grab his chin. Again, the same football grip that we used in the 10-finger grip, but on this side.  You are going to grab his chin.  Now, again, I grab my hand.  I don't cover the whole hand. \n\nI grab only a little of my hand and I'm going to punch my elbow forward. So, the movement is like this.  Punching my elbow up, OK?  One more time, punch my elbow up.  Now, I fall to the side.  I'm not going to fall backwards. I fall to the side, and finish.  Very important not to fall backwards in the guillotine, OK?  One more time.  Let's do that again from a different angle.  Now one last thing, what we want to do is we want to make sure we have a good plan B.  So, instead of going just to closed guard, I want to also be able to submit him from a better position. So, we can do this as well.  As I punch...a little more advanced version where you wind up in the mountain, but that is preferable to guard.  Because if you miss the guillotine, you're in mountain.

I'm thinking she would forgive...) and/but I think it works for what it was and for what it was meant to be.   \n\nAgain, I hope everyone can overlook and understand the lyric changes.

But do you know what's behind the bulging bump?\n\n\"Goiter is a general definition of an enlarged gland.  And it has a lot of, a lot of different causes.  Could be the inflammatory, could be the thyroiditis, could be multiple tumors, could be multiple nodules or cysts,\" says Dr. Jacob Goldberger, general surgeon on Lee Memorial Health System's medical staff. \n\nThe most common cause worldwide is an iodine deficiency. The thyroid concentrates iodine from the body to produce its hormone. In the absence of iodine, the body attempts to compensate. It's still an issue in undeveloped countries.\n\nIn this country goiter cases dropped drastically in the 1920's once iodine was infused in table salt. The more common cause of goiter in the U.S. is autoimmune thyroiditis - where the body attacks itself.\n\n\"The general term that applies to it is Hashimoto Thyroiditis. The gland burns itself out and essentially stops functioning.  But in the process, it forms a huge, scarified gland, non-functioning,\" says Dr. Goldberger. \n\nGraves disease may also produce a goiter. \n\n\"Graves disease is a hyperactive, or excessively active, thyroid.  It becomes enlarged, swollen, and very uncomfortable for the patient and is treated medically very easily most times with either medication or radioactive iodine.  On occasion, it is difficult to control and they're sent over to the surgeon,\" says Goldberger. \n\nIf a goiter gets so large that it constricts the airway, your doctor may recommend removal. In itself, the goiter is generally harmless.\n\"An enlarged gland itself is of no consequence unless: one, you have symptoms of breathing difficulty, swallowing problems or pressure situation, or if it's quickly enlarging suggest that you may have something else going on such as a tumor growing,\" says Dr. Goldberger. \n\nIf you or your doctor detects a goiter, it's important to determine the cause and then respond appropriately.  \n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n \nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

I am a 24 year old vlogger who had a very damaging experience at your canoga park location.\n\nI didn't get 10 seconds into the store when I was told \"I would not fit anything\" and that I wasn't allowed to try anything on because \"I would stretch the clothes out\" mind you, I fit MANY one size fits all (lingerie, halloween costumes, etc) so I found this beyond offensive. my sister has shopped here on numerous occasions (size 0) and they are beyond friendly, however many of my viewers on my latest video where I describe the experience, have gone through similar situations.\n\nwhile I understand big companies such as brandy melville can't control all their stores/locations, I feel when blatant discrimination/hate occurs, you should KNOW.\n\nI was told to email you. I was hesitant to put the video up, but the experience was beyond traumatizing and depressing. while I'm a 24 year old adult, I can handle it; however what about these teens? something so nasty said to them could push them over the edge.\n\nthis is the store location and address http://www.westfield.com/shop/stores/brandymelville/topanga?retailer=46692\n\nif you need any further information, I can find that out. my sister works at this mall and sees this girl on a regular basis.\n\nplease advise your company statement on this and I can put up a follow-up video as many people are upset over such bias displayed.\n\nRegards,\n\nTrisha Paytas\nxxx-xxx-xxxx\n\n*****BRANDY MELVILLE SENT OUT MULTIPLE TWEETS TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE (which have no since been deleted but I still have the screen grabs) acknowledging their legal action against me, so I felt it necessary to set straight what that legal action is.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nallegedly I went into brandy melville at topanga mall in canoga park. I walked in and allegedly didn't get 10 seconds into the store to look around when allegedly the sales person allegedly informed me that their store is one size fits all, which I understood. allegedly 10 seconds later allegedly she informed me I was allegedly not allowed to try anything on cause I allegedly might stretch it out. allegedly last I checked, I CAN fit into one size fits. allegedly I never said I was allegedly shopping for myself. allegedly, brandy melville sells other things besides clothes such as handbags and allegedly my fat ass is allegedly not even allowed to allegedly look.", "title": "Brandy Melville \"allegedly\" Hates Fat People", "publishedDate": "2012-07-24T23:36:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2p1AE3Z3j5I", "description": "Describes the jigsaw classroom paradigm in which each child is assigned to an expert group that is responsible for one part of each day's lesson.

A chunky little seed-eating bird with a thick bill, it has a body length of 14--15 cm (5.5--5.9 in). Its plumage is mainly warm rufous above and grey below. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the plumage of both sexes patterned similarly to that of the corresponding sex of House Sparrow. Its vocalisations are sweet and musical chirps, which when strung together form a song.\n\nThree subspecies are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness of their underparts. The subspecies rutilans and intensior breed in parts of eastern Asia, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in the Himalayas, where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation. The Russet Sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the House and Eurasian Tree sparrows are absent. In the southern part of its range, the Russet Sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. The Russet Sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art.\n\nThis sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, particularly during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the Russet Sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest is located in a tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

And so a simple practice that almost any Buddhist, and specifically the Zen lineage, the one that I hold and represent, will engage in is the practice of silence.  Contemplative silence.  And from the point of view of our particular lineage, if to some degree that contemplative intelligence has not been awakened, then we suffer.  We suffer from the effects of our own entrapment in conditioning.  And so I thought it might be a nice thing for us to just take a second, and please sit straight with me if you would for a moment.   In zen you know words fail.  And by the way, also, most mystic and contemplative traditions (practice this), its not strictly a Buddhist thing. If you look at Christian mysticism, Jewish mysticism, over and over the gate is silence.  And so as we take just a second, please bring your attention to your breath, and please just feel the breath enter the body, and leave the body.

I created this video to make sure that when I use the term Binge Eating Disorder you are clear about what it is I am talking about. Binge Eating Disorder is very similar to Bulimia Nervosa, but lacks one main characteristic. People with Binge Eating Disorder do not do anything after they have binged to \"make up\" for the binge. They do not purge, exercise, use laxatives, etc.  following their binge. They do, however, still have the other characteristics of Bulimia. They eat more than a \"normal\" amount of food in a short period of time. The DSM says within two hours, but I do not like to give constraints to my clients, and usually want to know what a binge is to them, in their terms. As well as those suffering from Bulimia, a person with Binge Eating Disorder will feel completely out of control during the binge. As with every other eating disorder, a person with Binge Eating Disorder will be completely obsessed with her weight, shape and size for a majority of her day. I hope that helps to clarify what Binge Eating Disorder is as well as how difficult it can be for those suffering to stop their behaviors. I also want to note that I do not limit my clients to these specific criteria, however when trying to get insurance coverage, they ask that these are the criterion that be used. It is my hope that leveraging social media whether it is YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn can help me reach more people and spread the word about eating disorders and how destructive they can be to the people who suffer from them as well as those closest to them.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/BvJR/", "title": "What is a BINGE Eating Disorder - Video #9", "publishedDate": "2012-01-10T06:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2pDFlIlHNRI", "description": "UniBond Humidity Absorber\n\nCombat condensation, damp rooms, allergens in the air, mold and mildew with the UniBond Humidity Absorber.

Nissan has only mention this in their service bulletin  NTB07-042 VQ40 ENGINE; BUZZING / WHINING NOISE. but has not issue a recall , Nissan states in their Service Bulletin information that the VQ Engine timing chain are all metal chains that do not require replacement, the timing chain is a lifetime part and the service manual does not specify a replacement schedule.\nFixing this problem may require several fixes the problem resurfaces with a higher mileage my 06 Nissan Frontier timing chain went bad at 45k, the problem occurs after the 5/60 power train warranty and the general 3/36? warranty expires, I'm just under 60K miles\n\nNissan Consumer Affairs representative that I talk to inform me that they will not pick up the cost to REPLACE THE CHAIN the part will cost $1400.00, it may happen to you the chain only goes bad after several thousand miles long after all warranty expires, go figure\nUnhappy Customer\nBrotherhood of Nissan junkies:\nDon't be shy to vent out your frustrations in this court of opinion it is the only satisfaction you will get for a while when dealing with your Nissan vehicle, to those of you who have a Nissan Frontier your troubles are just beginning, your first 25k going into 40k will seems natural however problem with the chain or belt whatever will start at 45k and totally ruin your warm filling about your purchase.\nTo make matters worse and it will get to that stage because Nissan will not honor replacement or work with you in anyway, oh yes am bad when you bring your vehicle to the dealer you will soon learn that your timing chain is going bad, if peradventure your warranty has expired and by that time it will, you are screwed. The cost of replacement is somewhere between $1400 + if you're lucky.\nAfter the fix look forward to redoing that same fix about 80k or better, other fixes will follow here are the signs to look forward to\n1. Bad Batteries\n2. Radiator Leak\n3. Seat Belt Lights continuously flashing\n4. Bad Tire sensor \n5.

Sa date d'origine est ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, mais remonte au-del\u00e0 du XIXe si\u00e8cle, puisque Paul Belloni Du Chaillu, premier explorateurs europ\u00e9en de l'int\u00e9rieur du Gabon, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pu observer sa pr\u00e9sence dans le centre du pays.\n\nLe Bwiti est aujourd'hui largement r\u00e9pandu au Gabon, aussi bien parmi les populations du sud du pays que chez les fang du Nord (diffusion autour de 1910 chez les fang), aussi bien en milieu rural qu'en milieu urbain. A travers les Fang, le Bwiti s'est \u00e9galement diffus\u00e9 en Guin\u00e9e \u00e9quatoriale et au sud Cameroun.\n\nLe rite de passage du Bwiti est centr\u00e9 sur la manducation par le n\u00e9ophyte d' \u00e9corces de racines de l'arbuste appel\u00e9 iboga ou eboga (Tabernanthe iboga). Divers alcalo\u00efdes pr\u00e9sents dans cette plante (notamment l'iboga\u00efne) poss\u00e8dent des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s psychodysleptiques de type hallucinog\u00e8ne. Pendant le rite de passage, l'absorption d'une dose massive d'iboga permet ainsi au n\u00e9ophyte d'obtenir des visions spectaculaires dont le r\u00e9cit aux initiateurs serviront \u00e0 valider son initiation.\n\nLa branche originelle du rite initiatique parmi les Mitsogo est appel\u00e9e Bwiti Dissumba. Il s'agit d'un rite de passage pubertaire, strictement masculin. Le Bwiti Dissumba s'appuie sur le culte des anc\u00eatres, notamment \u00e0 travers des reliquaires contenant les ossements des ascendants d\u00e9funts.\n\nLe Bwiti Misoko constitue une branche initiatique d\u00e9riv\u00e9e et post\u00e9rieure au Dissumba. Le Bwiti Misoko poss\u00e8de une fonction avant tout th\u00e9rapeutique (rite d'affliction): le n\u00e9ophyte choisit de se faire initier en cas d'infortune inexpliqu\u00e9e, dont on suspecte la plupart du temps qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par un sorcier malveillant. Les initi\u00e9s du Bwiti Misoko sont appel\u00e9s les nganga-a-Misoko, ou plus simplement nganga. Ils ont une fonction de devins-gu\u00e9risseurs. Contrairement au Bwiti Dissumba des Mitsogo et des Apinzi, le Bwiti Misoko accepte souvent (et de plus en plus) les femmes en son sein.\n\n-----------------\npendant ce temps DE L'AUTRE COTE DE L'OC\u00c9AN ...\n-----------------\n\n\n\"Je venais d'arriver \u00e0 Quirishari, dans la vall\u00e9e du Pichis, en Amazonie p\u00e9ruvienne, dans l'intention d'\u00e9tudier la mani\u00e8re dont les Indiens Ashaninca utilisent leurs ressources naturelles, une recherche de terrain qui devait durer deux ans et me conduire \u00e0 un doctorat en anthropologie de l'Universit\u00e9 de Stanford.\n\nPour me familiariser avec la vie des habitants du village, je me mis \u00e0 les accompagner dans leurs activit\u00e9s, en for\u00eat notamment. Au cours de ces balades sylvestres, je leur posais souvent des questions sur les plantes que nous rencontrions. Je me rendis compte tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t qu'ils ma\u00eetrisaient un savoir botanique litt\u00e9ralement encyclop\u00e9dique. Ils savaient tout des plantes qui acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent la cicatrisation, gu\u00e9rissent de la diarrh\u00e9e, soignent le mal de dos, neutralisent le venin de tel ou tel serpent. Chaque fois que l'occasion s'en pr\u00e9sentait, j'essayais moi-m\u00eame ces rem\u00e8des, v\u00e9rifiant empiriquement que ce que mes consultants indig\u00e8nes disaient \u00e9tait exact. In\u00e9vitablement, j'en vins \u00e0 leur demander comment ils avaient appris ce qu'ils savaient.\n\nIls me r\u00e9pondirent, d'une mani\u00e8re qui me parut fort \u00e9nigmatique, que leur savoir leur venait des plantes elles-m\u00eames, que les chamanes, apr\u00e8s avoir bu une mixture hallucinog\u00e8ne, parlaient, au sein de leurs visions, avec les essences anim\u00e9es ou esprits des plantes, qui sont les m\u00eames pour tous les \u00eatres vivants, et en obtenaient de l'information.\n\nIls ajoutaient que la nature est intelligente et parle un langage visuel, non seulement au travers d'hallucinations et de r\u00eaves, mais aussi de signes concrets quotidiens. C'est ainsi, par exemple, disaient-ils, que la plante qui \u00e0 la base de ses feuilles poss\u00e8de deux crochets blancs similaires \u00e0 ceux du serpent \"fer-de-lance\", gu\u00e9rit de la morsure de ce dernier. \"Regarde la forme, me disaient-ils. C'est le signe que la nature nous donne\". Comme si une m\u00eame intelligence animait le buisson et le reptile.\"\n\nextrait d'un entretien avec J\u00e9r\u00e9my Narby paru dans Le Temps strat\u00e9gique No 73, d\u00e9cembre 1996.", "title": "Rite Bwiti (extrait) jou\u00e9 par Pap\u00e9 Nziengui", "publishedDate": "2010-05-20T17:50:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2pVNDWoCynU", "description": "", "title": "Aboca: Dandelion", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T21:18:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2pVRi8Ltunw", "description": "http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/sherlockholmes\n\nGet ready to discover the world of a man who never lived and will never die...

The original version of this song appeared on the soundtrack to the 1986 film Shanghai Surprise (starring Madonna & Sean Penn). It was later re-recorded and produced by ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) frontman \"Jeff Lynne\" for Harrison's 1987 album \"Cloud Nine\".\n\nAlthough never released as a single and with no original video as such (for the album version) the track remains a huge favourite amongst fans. So as a tribute to this remarkable mans talents we have pieced together some promotional footage taken from the motion picture to form our own unique attempt at a clip to go with this beautiful version of a Harrison classic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy & RIP George.\n\nCloud Nine was a successful 1987 comeback album by George Harrison, recorded and released after a five year hiatus from his recording career. As home to the smash hit \"Got My Mind Set on You\", Cloud Nine re-established Harrison as a critically-acclaimed and commercially-significant recording artist. It was also George Harrison's final studio album released in his lifetime.\n\nFor more information about George you can visit:\n\nhttp://www.GeorgeHarrison.com\n\n*Note: If you are a Record Company employee or artist(s) themselves who object(s) to this commercially unavailable video footage being promoted on YouTube (albeit in a lossy mono audio format) then please contact us to have it removed before flagging it.\n\n\"You won't make a profit on something that cannot be purchased but enough exposure may well help sell what you actually do have for sale.

The gas line will need to connect to a Key Valve which is best installed in the side of your fire pit. This key valve is required in most states and promotes safety since the key is removable. Starfire Direct recommends whistle free stainless steel flex lines to connect the key valve to the propane air mixer. The air mixer then connects to your stainless steel pan which drops into your fire pit opening. The pan rests on a small ledge approximately 2-4\" below the top of your fire pit. The stainless steel fire ring then mounts directly to the stainless steel pan with the holes facing up. Water drainage will occur thru the weep holes in the pan. Finally, pour your fireglass onto the pan to cover the fire ring. \n\nFor propane gas to work properly with fireglass, it is important to take note of the following principles: \n\nPropane gas must mix with Air prior to combustion in order to burn properly. For this, Air intake is essential. We recommend ample ventilation located at the very bottom of your fire pit. This allows air to reach the air mixer which is attached under the burner pan. As the propane travels to the burner, air is sucked into the air mixer to dilute the propane. This process produces a cleaner and more efficient burning flame.Starfire Direct always recommends you test all of your connections prior to installing the fireglass. \n\nYour installation is complete!

Thanks to its elasticity Expandpouf can stretch in all directions while maintaining a uniform consistency.\n\nThat's why we called \"active ottoman with memory\": if you raise your head, or back, or any other part of the body, the pouf responds actively filling the space created by following just the body itself.\n\nTo promote elasticity and comfort we have eliminated completely the hinge on the whole perimeter.\n\nThe core is filled under pressure with a special technique developed by us. What remains is an object essentiality surprising.\n\nNot having left nothing to chance, we studied a cover outside, a veritable \"skin\", easily replaceable and washable which allows you to change the color of the ottoman at will even daily: thanks to the elasticity \"active\" material of this operation is in fact an unprecedented simplicity and allows you to leave the inner core always clean.

The inherent irony, of course, is that it is the callous playboy Duke himself who is mobile (\"inconstant\"). Its reprise in the last act is chilling, as Rigoletto realizes from the sound of the Duke's lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), that the body in the sack over which he has grimly triumphed is not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke but Sparafucile deceived him by killing Gilda, Rigoletto's beloved daughter, instead.\nThe canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate's performance of the bravura aria at the opera's 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening.[citation needed] It has been recorded by Enrico Caruso, Mario Lanza, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling, Vitas and hundreds of others. Before this song's first public performance (in Venice), it was rehearsed under tight secrecy: a necessary precaution, because it proved to be catchy and soon after its first public performance every gondolier in Venice was singing it.\nThe music\nThe almost comical-sounding theme of La donna \u00e8 mobile is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important\u2014and obvious\u2014omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, having left off not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time including the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello\n\nAutorizathed Review By .: 23 Records Entertainment Group (2005)\n\n\nDONATE PayPal here!

Called the Xact System\u2122, it solves multiple problems that long-range shooters face. The XactSystem ensures repeatable performance and accuracy even at extended ranges.\n\nThe PGF also offers applications for smart devices. These apps interact with embedded Wifi servers to share real-time or recorded images.\n\nThe Problems of Long-Range Shooting\n\nLong-range shots have historically been challenging. That's because shot accuracy is diminished by multiple variables: wind speed and direction, curvature of the earth, recoil, and human error caused by range miscalculation and jitter.\n\nFor the same reasons, speed and first-shot accuracy have also been difficult in attempting consecutive shots at multiple unknown distances.\n\nThe XactSystem PGF Delivers Accuracy\n\nThe PGF puts fighter-jet-style, lock-and-launch technology into a rifle system. Using the PGF, one can be an elite, long-range marksman in minutes. One can also more quickly and effectively take multiple shots at varying ranges.\n\nThe system virtually eliminates shooter error in...\n\n\u2022Aim\n\u2022Trigger pull\n\u2022Environmental inputs\n\u2022Range miscalculation\n\nIt delivers 5 times the first-shot success rate of traditional systems, at targets up to 1,200 yards (1.1 km), regardless of shooter skill level.\n\nShots in less-supported positions\u2014like kneeling, barrier-supported, and sitting\u2014are also possible using the PGF.\n\nWhat's in a PGF?\n\nThe exclusive TrackingPoint XactSystem includes:\n\n\u2022Custom rifle\n\u2022Precision conventional ammunition\n\u2022Networked Tracking Scope with Heads Up Display (HUD)\n\u2022Guided Trigger\n\nThe PGF uses precision XactShot\u2122 Ammunition, custom-loaded for TrackingPoint by Barnes\u00ae Bullets.\n\nWhat Does a PGF Do?\n\nWith the XactSystem, shooters can tag, track, and exactly hit an aim point. Using a shot process called Tag Track Xact (TTX), the PGF automatically adjusts for many factors, including:\n\n\u2022Range\n\u2022Temperature\n\u2022Barometric pressure\n\u2022Spin drift\n\u2022Wind input\n\u2022Cant\n\u2022Inclination\n\nWhat the Shooter Does\n\nTo operate the PGF, the shooter...\n\n1.Paints the target with the tag to lock on\n2.Watches as the tag persists, regardless of relative movement\n3.Aligns the reticle with the tag to produce the firing solution\n4.Squeezes and holds the trigger to arm the system\n\nWhen the reticle and tag are optimally aligned, the Networked Tracking Scope releases the guided trigger. As long as one can tag it, one can hit it.\n\nApps Provide Image Recording and Sharing\n\nPrecision Guided Firearms feature smart device applications for sharing real-time shot video and photos with others. \n\nThe ShotView\u2122 App streams real-time video from the Heads Up Display in the Networked Tracking Scope to the smart phone or tablet.\n\nThe Networked Tracking Scope also records :\n\n\u2022Video and voice audio of the shot sequences, from tag until 10-15 seconds after the shot\n\u2022Still photos of the tag, the shot, and the frame 10-15 seconds after the shot\n\u2022Shot data\n\n\nDisclaimer : I don't support or encourage hunting of animals.

This gimbal may look similar to what you are used to seeing in the market but it is vastly different in design. It has many unique proprietary features which resolve many of the issues which the other gimbals are exhibiting such as tube slipperage, false level initialization, motor/bearing slops, cumbersome tuning/balancing and portability. From our experience building the AllSteady-1 in 2013 and by studying all the other gimbals in the market, we have implemented the following patent pending designs into the all new AllSteady 7.\n\n1. Internal locking clamps for carbon tubes\n2. Cross lock motor mount\n3. Swivel top handle to allow gimbal to fold flat without any tools.\n4. Zero Slop bearing lock\n5. Multi-angle sensor level adjustment\n6. Single-lever tool-less balance adjustment\n\nAside from the proprietary designs, the AllSteady 7 has also many other improvements over the traditional gimbals.\n\n1. 30mm carbon tube verses the standard 25mm\n2. Battery level LED indicator that is viewable under sunlight. Auto low voltage shut-off\n3. Support bearing for all axis. The photo does not show the pan support cage but it will be included.\n4. By adapting the CNC components, we have greatly reduces the parts count and improved ergonomics.\n5. Foldable tool-less tuning stand that can fit in your pocket\n6. Twelve pound payload capacity.

The plant is a traditional cottage garden favourite, because it flowers in the depths of winter; large-flowered cultivars are available, as are pink-flowered and double-flowered selections.

Chan is Chief Inspector Lee of the Royal Hong Kong Police, who travels back to China with his American colleague, Los Angeles detective James Carter (Tucker). The men intend to take some vacation time but are quickly pulled into the case of two murdered U.S. customs agents, who were investigating an illegal counterfeiting scam involving Ricky Tan (John Lone), one of the most powerful Triad gangsters in Asia and an old enemy of Lee's. Lee and Carter are soon embroiled in a dangerous mystery that also involves a sexy secret-service agent (Roselyn Sanchez), a billionaire hotel owner (Alan King), a dangerous femme fatale (Zhang Ziyi) and a finale set in a lavish Las Vegas casino.\n\n\"rush hour 2\",\"rush hour 2 clip\",\"rush hour 2 part 1\",\"rush hour 2 full movie\",\"jackie chan\",\"chris tucker\",\"brett ratner\",\"trash can videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"crime thrillers\",\"martial arts\",\"roger birnbaum\",\"michael de luca\",\"toby emmerich\",\"andrew z davis\",\"james m freitag\",\"jonathan glickman\",\"jay stern\",\"arthur m sarkissian\",\"leon dudevoir\",\"darryl jones\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++249184,/m/012d40,/m/01900g", "title": "Rush Hour 2 (2/5) Movie CLIP - Massage Parlor Fight (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T04:17:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qKyJlFupXA", "description": "For further information, view this great product at: http://www.louielighting.com/Venetia-Studium-Fortuny-079-SA-1-Scudo-Saraceno-Decorated-Silk-Suspended-Large?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=product-treepodia, And enjoy FREE shipping*\nThe Venetia Studium - Fortuny 079-SA-1 Scudo Saraceno Decorated Silk Suspended - Large is brought to you by http://www.louielighting.com/, Enjoy our superior customer service, expert advice, no hassle returns and 100% price guarantee*.\n\nFORTUNy VENETIA STUDIUM SCUDO SARACENO DECORATED SILK SUSPENDED - LARGEFortunyScudoSaraceno Decorated Silk lamp by Venetia Studium, with its shield-like shape decorated with ottoman motifs and the configuration of its sections starting out from the center, create a wonderful halo effect, takes you back to a world of beauty, elegance, and grandeur.

The most striking feature of a barasingha is its antlers, with 10 to 14 tines on a mature stag, though some have been known to have up to 20. The name is derived from this characteristic and means 12 tined or horned in Hindi. In Assamese, barasingha is called dolhorina; dol meaning swamp. In Central India it is called goinjak (stags) or gaoni (hinds).\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

To me he was the hardest boss in the entire game, but rightfully so. I found parrying to be the best way to put up a fight. For some reason unlike all other parryable enemies, Gwyn cannot be backstabbed. It made it that much harder. I was SL 70 in all the battles.\n\nThe strategy was simply to parry his attacks with the Target Shield which has a larger window for parrying and riposte with Hornet's Ring and Lightning Zweihander +5 for five times, not taking any damage. The key to victory lies in the timing of the parry and being able to dodge Gwyn's swings and concentrate on his next move. It didn't go as well as my other runs, where I succeeded in doing just that four times without having to rely on Estus or even taking damage. However the fifth parry was always a failure and ended up getting me killed. I tried wearing Havel's set, Iron Flesh and spamming R1/parrying him, but not being able to do much I shortly quit doing that. Gwyn doesn't usually leave you any time to even consider drinking Estus or using Sorceries (which I had but were too weak to even tickle him), Pyromancies (casting time was too great) or Miracles (my Faith is 8 on this character). He is more aggressive than Flamelurker at low HP in Demon's Souls, more tough than Four Kings and hits harder than Smough's hammer. I decided to upload the last and successful battle first on its own. I might upload the other ones just to show the progress and failures of the past.\n\nI literally stood up to perform the gesture \"Praise the Sun!\" as I heard that last parry sound. \n\nUnfortunately I picked the \"Dark Lord\" ending, even though I wanted the \"Link the Fire\" one. I was too blind to see the bonfire (which isn't easy to spot as it's small and not lit) and instead wandered out of the room.", "title": "Dark Souls Boss - Gwyn, Lord of Cinder", "publishedDate": "2011-11-20T21:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qQm6KRycxY", "description": "Samuel Harfst - Mit dir kommt der Sommer HQ", "title": "Samuel Harfst Mit dir kommt der Sommer HQ", "publishedDate": "2012-11-11T15:14:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qQnluwtlSU", "description": "Tratamiento Del L\u00edquido Articular\n\nViscosuplementaci\u00f3n - L\u00edquido Articular - Howard Beach, Ozone Park, Queens NY - Medicina Regenerativa - Benjamin Bieber, MD\n\n\nhttp://www.crossbaypmr.com\n\nCross Bay Medicina F\u00edsica y Rehabilitaci\u00f3n  - \nViscosuplementaci\u00f3n - Osteoartritis - Tratamiento Del L\u00edquido Articular\n\n \n\nEl avanze de la osteoartritis produce que el l\u00edquido de la articulaci\u00f3n sana comienza a descomponerse.

These two \"poison city\" poets have faced each other as battle cats, played the same festivals, held down similar ciphers, and finally found themselves together on a track, committed to the same cause.\n\nThe track \"Intifada Intellect\" speaks about the rise of fascism in Israel, the growth of this Apartheid state, the similarity to the South African situation and our unique position as a people that have battled this system and won once before.  The track goes into the nature of Israeli Apartheid as being non-religious, affecting diverse lives in its all encompassing process of ethnic exclusion, driven by a Zionist agenda that mirrors the racially divisive structures of South Africa pre-democracy.\n\nEwok speaks about the title \"Intifada Intellect\" meaning \"a study of struggle\", specifically \"My generation of South Africans were children when Apartheid here was in its death throes.  We have gone on to learn about it, both at school and in our homes, as our parents generation began the difficult process of healing age-old wounds and coming to terms with, in the case of the white South Africans, the part they played in this oppression.  We are literally students of the struggle.  It informs the politics of our daily lives, and we have to understand it in order to make sense of the democracy we are currently trying to build.\"\n\nThe track was produced as a call to this generation, out of respect for the struggle our parents lived through, to take up the cause of the Palestinian people who are also victims of this oppressive crime against humanity.\n\nThe video illustrates the study of Apartheid, and highlights various powerful contemporary sources of study, in the various film and print media publications and productions that have informed the authors of the lyrics.\n\nRaheem Kemet:  The South African scene has long been stimulated by the presence of this 30yr old Islamic MC, an artist hailing from Durban, who first entered the psyches of heads as CHILDOSYLENZ in 2003.  A gifted freestyle artist and acapella lyricist, Raheem made his mark in the street ciphers and on the \"Open Mics\" of a burgeoning scene.  The first Durban head to feature in HYPE MAGAZINE, his career has developed through various projects, culminating in the release of a full length album with the award winning band Tree Houses On The Sea (T.H.O.T.S.) entitled \"The return of the Book Thief\".  The album is based on the best selling novel of that name by Markus Zusak, dealing with the loss of childhood innocence in Nazi Germany during WW2.  This artist continues to take strides forward along his solo path, and can be experienced in his current manifestation as Raheem Kemet.\n\ntwitter: @RaheemKemet\nfacebook:  www.facebook.com/TheRaProjekt\nsoundcloud:  www.soundcloud.com/raheemkemet\n\niainEWOKrobinson:  32yr old iainEWOKrobinson defines himself as a Spoken Word flavored Hip Hop activist.  A student of Hip Hop culture since his initiation into the scene as a graffiti writer in his junior years at high school, this east coast native first appeared as one half of original Durban Hip Hop crew ILLUMINATING SHADOWS in 2003.  Collaborations during his tertiary studies with KZN based FLATFOOT Dance Company set him up in the Spoken Word scene, from where he has built an international career as a performance poet and MC.  A signee member of South African Artists Against Apartheid, Ewok has worked consistently with the South African BDS movement on producing cultural solidarity work in the form of poems, music and videos in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\ntwitter:  @ewokessay\nartist page:  www.reverbnation.com/creamyewokbaggends\nsoundcloud:  www.soundcloud.com/creamy-ewok-baggends\n\n[audio download and lyrics link - https://soundcloud.com/creamy-ewok-baggends/intifada-intellect]", "title": "Intifada Intellect", "publishedDate": "2014-03-12T21:27:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qSB1_Q0Ow0", "description": "Tatu bem tranquilo comendo cupins sem se incomodar com minha presen\u00e7a\nV\u00eddeo feito na futura RPPN Guainumbi\nwww.reservaguainumbi.com.br", "title": "Tatu-de-rabo-mole - Cabassous tatouay", "publishedDate": "2008-06-15T13:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qSBJbHowSs", "description": "Fiona Brenner reports how the MBA allowed her to move from policy-based work in the not-for-profit sector to operations.

Kota Haifa yang berjarak lebih dari 100 kilometer dari Gaza, kota Tel Aviv, kota Rohuvot dan Bat Yam, dan sejumlah wilayah penjajah Yahudi lainnya telah merasakan kehebatan roket rakitan lokal Brigade Al-Qassam.\n\nDari ratusan roket yang telah ditembakkan oleh Brigade Al-Qassam, empat jenis diantaranya merupakan roket rakitan terbaru mereka; M 75, R 160, J 80 dan S 55. Kemampuan dan jangkauan jaraknya yang luar biasa untuk ukuran roket rakitan telah membuktikan kemampuan pesat pengembangan roket yang kini dikuasai oleh Brigade Al-Aqsha.\n\nBrigade Al-Qassam sendiri dalam rilisan terbarunya menyebut peperangan kali ini sebagai \"Peperangan Daun-daun yang Dimakan [ulat]\", diambil dari kisah penghancuran pasukan gajah dengan lemparan kerikil oleh burung-burung Ababil dalam Surat Al-Fil.\n\nBrigade Al-Qassam melalui situs dan akun resminya telah merilis video pendek yang memperlihatkan penembakan roket-roket M 75, R 160, J 80 dan S 55 ke wilayah penjajah zionis Yahudi.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam.

The palm is kept face up, hand relaxed and open. If your calcium is low, your thumb draws in towards the palm of the hand and cramps up, the fingers will cramp too. This became positive for me during my stay at the hospital so they decided to give me the calcium drip. However, the day I was released, it had been negative twice. So this is a very telling test.

They are solitary insects that build nests out of mud in sheltered locations, frequently on man-made structures. These nests are not aggressively defended, and stings are rare. Mud daubers make use of spiders to provision their cells. The black and yellow mud dauber's nest is comprised of a series of cylindrical cells that are plastered over to form a smooth nest that may attain nearly the size of a human fist. After building a cell, the female wasp captures several spiders. The captured prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest, and then a single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell. The wasp then seals the cell with mud. After finishing a series of cells, she leaves and does not return. Eventually, the hatching larva will eat the prey and emerge from the nest. A common species of cuckoo wasp, Chrysis angolensis, is frequently a cleptoparasite in Sceliphron nests, and is only one of many different insects that parasitize these mud daubers. http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Insects/Wasps+and+bees/Common+species/Mud+Dauber+and+Potter+wasps", "title": "Mud Insect Nest - Black and Yellow Mud Dauber | MUD WASP", "publishedDate": "2013-08-01T19:30:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qyAoYC8TZ8", "description": "Camera: Sony (\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc) Cyber-shot DSC HX5V B (broken)\nTripod: Sony VCT 60AV\nFormat: Movie MOV; AVCHD-MP4; 16:9; 1440p x 1080p; Audiocodec AAC; Videocodec H264\nDate: May 9th, 2011 \nDescription: The Dresden Zoo after 150 years.   http://www.zoo-dresden.de/de/Deutsch_10.html?lang=de\n\nPlaylist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL33ED727C0AEBB4C4", "title": "Banteng", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T10:56:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qyFuHO-K6c", "description": "Peace - Lovesick (Corona Music Live Session) Live at Strongroom. \nCont\u00e1giate del sonido de Peace en su sesi\u00f3n exclusiva para Corona Music.\n\nSuscr\u00edbete a CoronaTV: http://goo.gl/vxuIkB\n\nIngresa a http://www.coronamusic.com", "title": "Peace - Lovesick (Corona Music Live Session)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T07:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qyJgPEA1h8", "description": "Etoile Greatest Hits, \u00e8 la nuova ed esclusiva collana dvd Etoile che raccoglie in se tutto il meglio del materiale audiovisivo creato nei 25 anni di esperienza\n Questo doppio dvd contiene procedimenti e filmati per eseguire i seguenti soggetti suddivisi per metodo di lavorazione", "title": "Decorazioni - Massa Ticino CD10", "publishedDate": "2008-03-25T16:45:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2qyMAzI1J8c", "description": "It's all true...

When she came home, she discovered he had vanished. A fruitless search ensues, and months later, a boy claiming to be the nine-year-old is returned. Dazed by the swirl of cops, reporters and her conflicted emotions, Christine allows him to stay overnight. But, in her heart, she knows he is not Walter. As she pushes authorities to keep looking, she learns that in Prohibition-era L.A., women don't challenge the system and live to tell their story. Slandered as delusional and unfit, Christine finds an ally in activist Reverend Briegleb, who helps her fight the city to look for her missing boy.\n\nchangeling,\"changeling clip\",\"changeling trailer\",\"changeling part 1\",\"angelina jolie\",\"michael kelly\",\"asher axe\",\"jeffrey hutchinson\",\"lily knight\",\"20th century period pieces\",\"crime dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"brian grazer\",\"ron howard\",\"clint eastwood\",\"geyer kosinski\",\"helping videos\",\"hope videos\",\"los angeles videos\",\"christine collins\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++391262,/m/0bvqf6p,/m/02q9k68,/m/0f4vbz,/m/0gbxz9z", "title": "Changeling (12/12) Movie CLIP - Hope (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T09:54:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2r9WCqExfZ0", "description": "Jim Winter explains the HEAD LINE", "title": "JIM WINTER Teahing Palm reading", "publishedDate": "2007-04-05T11:52:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2r9Yzwnlq-4", "description": "Myrciaria cauliflora, P\u00e1ssaros na jabuticabeira, Frutos alimento preferido dos passarinhos, Las frutas, alimento preferido de las aves, Frutta, il cibo preferito degli uccelli, Fruits, preferred food of birds, de la nourriture pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e des oiseaux, Obst, bevorzugte Nahrung von V\u00f6geln,", "title": "Myrciaria cauliflora, P\u00e1ssaros na jabuticabeira, Frutos alimento preferido dos passarinhos,", "publishedDate": "2012-11-19T14:48:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2rA0PghEd4o", "description": "Kot, kt\u00f3rego g\u0142aszcz\u0119 jest zes\u0142anym w zwierz\u0119ce cia\u0142o bogiem ognia.

I think it is the very best way to teach a family all at once, since it covers ages K-6th grade.  Instead of trying to do a \"cover everything\" approach, Apologia textbooks are very specific to one field of science, such as Botany, Zoology, Astronomy, etc. which is not what we are used to for young children, but oh, it works so well!  We can really delve into the subject!  One textbook is to be used as a year-long family unit study which I really appreciate, as it is so much easier to teach all the kids the same topic, and do the experiments together.\n\nThe chapters are fun to read aloud together, as the tone is conversational, like \"let's all learn together!\" There are hands-on activities, and experiments at the end of each chapter that we had a good time doing, plus they didn't use any odd ingredients so I could really pull them together quickly&--I love that! Each student develops their own science notebook that contains their writing \"narrations\" of the things they have learned along with their illustrations, vocabulary words, projects, etc. This really works and is fun! My kids were excited about the cool science notebooks they were involved making.\n\nOne of the things I really love about Apologia science books is that I don't have to always be running interference, and trying to explain our faith in a God who created the universe. That seems to be a dominant problem when using secular science resources. When teaching astronomy, I am always faced with the Big Bang theory, the \"trillions of years old\" stuff, and trying to keep faith strong in the face of scientific \"proof\" that we are all evolved creatures living in an accidental universe. Apologia's Astronomy book is fabulous for giving reasons to support faith in God while teaching scientific truths! One of the interesting facts presented by this book is that Venus spins the opposite direction than the other planets in our solar system. The Big Bang theory says a big explosion set the planets all spinning, whirling out the same direction from a central \"bang\". If this was so, Venus should also be rotating the same direction. I love learning facts that support Christian doctrines!\n\nThese quality hardcover books are full of gorgeous full-color photos and pictures, interesting information.  Opportunities for discussion and narration are inserted during the lesson. Experiments and assignments follow with opportunities to add to your notebook.  Each book is divided into chapters that I use as our week's science focus.  Written on a 4th grade level, so young ones will enjoy hearing it read aloud, and older students can read it themselves (although they still sure enjoy hearing it read aloud in a family setting, where discussions can develop).  Information supports the National Standards of Science, but more importantly, supports Christian beliefs.  This in-depth approach uses the elements of the Charlotte Mason and classical methods for a wonderful learning experience!\n\nChoose the topic your family is most interested in learning first&--that's the fun of it!  Then progress to the next topic of interest. Here is the order they were written in, if you have no preference: Astronomy, Botany, Zoology 1: Flying Creatures, Zoology 2: Swimming Creatures and finally, Zoology 3: Land Animals.  If you are wishing for more, no worries:  two books, one on Anatomy and another covering Physics + Chemistry are in the works by this excellent author!", "title": "www.LovetoLearn.net--How Apologia Science Works!", "publishedDate": "2010-03-10T22:37:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2rFicu0IH30", "description": "MLS# 357407  http://www.islandproperties.com Welcome to another Haiku, Maui, HI property for sale brought to you by Roan Browne of Coldwell Banker Island Properties - The Leader in Haiku, HI Real Estate Services.\nThis video contains information on one of our Haiku, HI Homes for sale.\nListing Address: 0 Honopou Rd Haiku, HI  96708\nProperty Type: Residential\nPrice: 1,994,000\nAgent Name: Roan Browne\nAgent Email: roan@mauire.net\nAgent Phone: 808 283 3301\nAgent Website: www.MauiRE.net\nAgency: Coldwell Banker Island Properties\nAgency Phone: 808-579-8000\nAgency Website: http://www.islandproperties.com\n\nProperty Information:\nBuilding Square Feet: 0\nBedrooms:  \nBathrooms Full: \nBathrooms Partial: \nProperty Size: 10 Acres \n\nDescription: Magnificent Ocean Front property on Maui\u00e2\u0080\u0099s majestic North Shore.

Bis!\" in the Theatre \u201eMorskie Oko\", Syrena-Electro 1932.\n\nNOTE: Composer Fred MELODYST (or: Melodysta) b. 1894 in Warsaw, died 1960 in Italy. He was also a bandleader, banjo and cello player, member of the famous musicial family Melodyst in Warsaw. (His protoplast was Panfil Melodyst, altoviolist in Warsaw Opera and Warsaw Symphony orchestras, his cousins were famous composers and bandleaders, brothers Artur and Henryk Gold, his aunt was an international primadonna,  Eleonora Melodyst). Until 1914, Fred studied composition and cello at Warsaw Conservatory, then during Ist World War he served in the army. The end of the war meant for him a switch towards a light music, which he professionally played since 1916 as member of the dance band led by his uncle, Ignacy Melodyst. In 1922 Fred Melodyst  joined Karasinski and Kataszek dance band, which  as the orchestra playing mainly the newest jazz compositions from USA - was quickly becoming a hit troughout Poland. With Karasi\u0144ski & Kataszek Band (sometimes called in the ads as Karasi\u0144ski & Melodysta Band) he played in the most fashionable restaurants and night bars of Warsaw (\u201eOaza\"), Krak\u00f3w, Zakopane in the mountains (\u201eTrzaska Restaurant\") or in the sea resort Sopot on the Baltic shore (\u201eErmitage\"). In 1927 he established his own orchestra: \u201eJazz Freda Melodysty\" that in  early 1930s was contracted at Hotel Angielski (English Hotel) in Warsaw . Since 1936 he performed in his own night club \u201eBar Arizona\" and also composed for Warsaw cabarets, mainly  \u201eMorskie Oko\" and \u201eBanda\". Among \u201eschlagers\" he composed, the most popular was tango \u201eAdieu, kochanko ma!\" performed in the theatre \u201eMorskie Oko\" in the 1932 revue \u201eBrawo! Bis!\". \n\nIn September 1939 as a sergeant of the Polish Army, Fred Melodyst faught with the Germans invading Poland. After the defeat in the Fall 1939 he managed to get through to the city of Lwow (now in Ukraine)  that in the meantime was attacked by the Red Army and finally was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Fred Melodyst shared the fate of most of the Polish inhabitanbts of Lwow, who were in their majority arrested by the NKWD (the Stalinist political police) and transported into the work camps in the Soviet empire. In 1942, however, after Hitlers attack on the USSR, Melodyst  together with thousands of Polish soldiers (- those who were still alive after two years of imprisonment in the Soviet Union) - was released and he managed to join the Polish Army being foremed by General Anders first in the Soviet Union, and later in Persia. Its where he met his prewar musical friends from Warsaw: composers and bandleaders Jerzy Petersburski and Henryk Gold. They created a trio, and very successfully performed for the Polish emigree soldiers during their long march with the Allied Forces via Palestine, Egipt, to Italy and England.

It's called the single double rest theory, and in essence he has given it that name because, when you strip it down to the bare bones, anything you play on the drums is composed of, either a single stroke, a double stroke or their equivalent rests. It is a great concept to learn, and many great artists have devised their own method based on these same concepts (Ex. Benny Greb's Language of Drumming). Practice this and watch your drumming skills increase TENFOLD. Enjoy.\n\nSIDE NOTE: I would have never stumbled onto this method if I hadn't had the courage to e-mail J.P one day to say what's up. Through that process I found out about his drum camp and made plans to attend. All to say, follow your heart and dreams cause they will lead you to places never thought imaginable. \n\nVIDEO LESSON BREAKDOWN (SIXTEENTH NOTE SUBDIVISION):\n\n1. Played on beat 1\n2.
