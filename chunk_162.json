I probably could have taken it to a muffler shop for a little cheaper. But I was looking at going ahead and replacing the exhaust manifold/catalytic converter myself and saving the money. A friend suggested JB Weld. But I did some research and found that JB Weld was only rated to 550 degrees. I needed something that would stand a high temperature. I found mentions of a product by Blue Magic called ThermoSteel High-Temp Metal Repair or QuikSteel Xtreme. It seems to be the same stuff, just with different labels. It's rated to 2400F degrees. And it's designed for high temperature metal repair for iron and steel. And my exhaust manifold is cast iron. For only $10 it was worth a try. I bought a small container of the QuikSteel Xtreme at my local auto parts store. It wasn't too hard to apply and seems to have worked. My car is quieter and seems to be running a little smoother after the repair. It's probably good not to have and exhaust leaking from under the hood also. Definately something I wanted to fix.

Based on the comic book series created by Bob Burden, Mystery Men is set in the teeming metropolis of Champion City, where noble superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) keeps the peace and sees that justice is done. When Captain Amazing mysteriously disappears, his archenemy Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) sees his opportunity to seize power and bend the city to his evil will, with his associate Dr. Annabel Leek (Lena Olin) at his side. However, Casanova will not succeed without a fight, as the The Mystery Men leap into action. The Mystery Men are not your ordinary Men of Steel; in fact, they're barely superheroes at all. Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) has one gift: throwing tantrums. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) is a deadly hand with spoons and forks (but not knives). Shoveler (William H. Macy) can dig with superior speed and force. The Bowler (Janeane Garafalo) rolls the ball with superhuman precision. Spleen (Paul Reubens) has a gaseous problem that he's turned into a weapon against evildoers. Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) is convinced he can become invisible at will, but he hasn't actually done it yet. And The Sphinx (Wes Studi) does have an unusual power: he can cut metal objects with his mind. Aided by addled gadget master Dr. Heller (Tom Waits), the Mystery Men make their move against Casanova and Annabel, who feel just threatened enough to make things personal by kidnapping Mr. Furious' girlfriend Monica (Claire Forlani). Mystery Men marked the feature directorial debut of Kinka Usher, who previously directed such ads as the Taco Bell talking chihuahua and the Dairy Association's \"Got Milk?\"\n\n\"mystery men\",\"mystery men clip\",\"mystery men part 1\",\"mystery men soundtrack\",\"ben stiller\",\"william h macy\",\"greg kinnear\",\"hank azaria\",\"claire forlani\",\"kinka usher\",\"clipboard videos\",\"fork videos\",\"spoon videos\",\"independent action adventure\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",comedy,\"comic books and superheroes\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"lloyd levin\",\"robert engelman\",\"steven gilder\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++180251,/m/0sw6g,/m/02t_st,/m/023kzp,/m/0mdqp,/m/01x72k", "title": "Mystery Men (1/10) Movie CLIP - Dinner Full of Bicker (1999) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T15:02:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9DJWO9-_Sa8", "description": "Watch original web series on EpicTV first at www.epictv.com\n\n\"After the best winter of powder skiing and steep skiing that I have had in 35 years on snow, the finest way to end the season was to climb and ski the highest mountain in Europe, which just happens to sit above the town of Chamonix.

Scrub the inside with care to avoid scratching the coating. Dry immediately with a soft dishcloth. \n\nTip\nClean especially well before using if you see greenish-blue spots inside the pan, which can indicate verdigris, a poisonous chemical reaction that occurs when copper is exposed to acetic acid.\n\nStep 2: Use for sauces\nWhen cooking sauces in copper, don't stir as often as you would when using other types of cookware. Copper heats more evenly than any other metal, so you won't have to worry about whether some parts of the pan are cooler than others. \n\nStep 3: Heat first when frying\nWhen frying or sauteing, add the fat to the pan and cook on low for one minute before increasing the heat and adding other ingredients.\n\nStep 4: Use copper for candy\nUse copper when making sugar syrups, preserves, caramel, and melting chocolate. Copper\u2019s heat conductivity and quick reaction to temperature changes offers precise control over the different stages of candy preparation. \n\nStep 5: Clean up\nWhatever you cook, allow the cookware to cool completely before washing, or it may warp. Remember to dry your cookware immediately with a soft cloth. \n\nStep 6: Polish\nAs you're cookware begins to lose its luster, develops water spots, or turns pinkish, purple, or orange, polish it with anti-tarnish copper polish.\n\nTip\nKetchup also removes copper tarnish, though it doesn't restore shine. Apply a thin layer to the outside of cookware, and allow it to stand for five minutes before rinsing. \n\nStep 7: Store you cookware\nStore your cookware in a dry place at room temperature. Keep it away from heat and humidity, which can make it tarnish faster. \n\nDid You Know?\nDid you know?

The cheerful optimist Maria, 82, and her husband Tadeusz, 80, a quietly pessimistic academic, have lived in a flat in the Polish town of Posen for the past 66 years.

Their conversations about the imminent loss of their familiar surroundings, the place Maria grew up and later cared for her invalid parents, are the starting point for happy, but also painful, memories of bygone times. Their grandson, the Vienna-based filmmaker Filip Antoni Malinowski, offers them support in this existential crisis and helps them search for a new home.\nA film about injustice and inequality that also takes stock of ongoing social-economic transformations and changing mentalities in post-communist Poland, the effects of which are felt most keenly, perhaps, by the older generation.", "title": "RESETTLEMENT Trailer", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T15:37:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9DZPG9jriFo", "description": "", "title": "Pre\u00e1 - Cavia aperea 12.02.2013.mov", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T22:41:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9DZvFJZjIUk", "description": "http://www.askapersonaltrainer.net\nDumbbell Pullovers\nIncline Dumbbell Press(Palms In)\nIncline Push Up", "title": "3 Key Chest Exercises To Build The Upper Chest", "publishedDate": "2010-06-25T21:06:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9D_7m-Qg6E0", "description": "Finding out if you're eligible for Centrelink's Youth Allowance as a student isn't complicated. \n\nTo be eligible for Youth Allowance as a student you need to be between 18 and 24 years old (although in some instances 16 to 17 year olds are eligible), studying full time in an approved course and an Australian resident.\n\nWe also look at your income and assets to make sure you're under the threshold. \n\nIf you're considered dependent, we need to look at your parents' income and assets as well. \n\nIf you're considered independent your parents' income and assets won't affect your eligibility. \n\nAll the information you need is on our website at www.humanservices.gov.au/youthallowance\n\nVisit our website:\nhttp://www.humanservices.gov.au/\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/HumanServicesGovAu?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFind us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HumanServicesAU\nhttps://www.facebook.com/familyupdateAU\nhttps://www.facebook.com/officialhankjongen\nhttps://www.facebook.com/StudentUpdate\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Grads4HumanServ\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/HumanServicesAU\nhttps://twitter.com/Centrelink\nhttps://twitter.com/FamilyUpdateAU\nhttps://twitter.com/HankJongen\nhttps://twitter.com/StudentUpdateAU", "title": "Eligibility for Centrelink's Youth Allowance", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T22:13:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9D_GDCb0NJQ", "description": "a fun \u201e creative way", "title": "How To Put On A Relaxive Khimar", "publishedDate": "2012-08-15T03:44:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9D_QvN1Z7RE", "description": "Scleromystax sp. c113", "title": "MOVIE0001.mpg", "publishedDate": "2010-03-07T19:29:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9D_oeKPBd4A", "description": "For more information please visit http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1353\n\nImages and video courtesy of the artists and designers.

What I learned there was how to attract the publics attention, generate and, increase interest, and assimilate information.

From my experience, I have learned that in this way, the Holy Land becomes more than just history, and that the large stones that we see scattered about in dissaray, join together one by one until they become - a Byzantine Church. This also happens when I lead a group of Pilgrims in the Steps of Jesus. We climb to the peak of Mount Precipice, \"glide\" over the land to the Sea of Galilee, land on the water and \"see\" the miracle which enfolds before us. This is a many faceted experience.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Women Participation in a Puja", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T11:24:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Dcxh9J-ZdU", "description": "From Goldenbeartoys.com comes an exciting new range of Bananas in Pyjamas Toys Including the Funhouse Playset and Bedtime Banana Buddy.

Despite reservations, the government has decided to implement the WHO's restrictions and would set up special centers at all airports to issue health certificates to citizens traveling abroad. Pakistan is one of only three countries where the polio virus remains endemic.

What are a Realtor's fiduciary responsibilities to you, the client? What is a realtors highest value to you? How on a $2 million transaction with $60,000 in commissions can a client be delighted with their realtor receiving that fee for their services?  I'll give you a hint it has nothing to do with putting up signs, making flyers, sitting in open houses, setting up property alerts, driving you around to see homes,  It has everything to do with representing your best interests in every conversation and negotiating for every dollar as if it were their own money at stake. What does excellence in negotiations and representation look like?  Best price. Best Terms. No surprises! \nCalifornia and US law, makes it clear that a Realtor has fiduciary responsibilities to their client similar to an a Dr. or an Attorney. It begins your Realtor putting their clients financial interests above their own. Sounds simple enough. 30 day close of escrow versus 45, the question should only be which is best for you, the client, not which one gets the Realtors paid sooner. The other agent calls and asks your agent \"what's your client bottom line #, so that you and I can put this deal together\"?  \nBut like the legal & medical field a Realtors fiduciary responsibility also includes keeping what their client has told them confidential. Sounds simple enough. The Buyer or their agent asks, \"So why are your Sellers selling?\". Your agent knows you are going through a tough divorce. If they disclose that, could it have an adverse affect on you, their client? Even the prior question, \"what's your client bottom line #?\". Violation of confidentiality.\nA Realtor's fiduciary responsibility on the other hand is to fully disclose to their client everything they know about the property or the other parties to the transaction. Sounds simple enough. The other agent tells your agent, \"hey confidentially, my clients are going through a divorce, but our clients are so far apart right now on price, don't tell your client, it will just make it less likely for your client to offer more\". Yesh!!!   Sadly, more often than not, many real estate transactions where I've dutifully represented my Buyers or Sellers   I've seen each of these fundamentals fiduciary duties violated by the other party's agent.  Fulfilling my fiduciary responsibility to my client is in my mind, just, a basic, \"got to have\".   Our clients say it best, this is one of the areas where I excel. And I assure you that anyone who joins the Luxury and Country International Real Estate team will have to also!  I would strongly encourage you to talk to our past clients and ask them about how well we negotiated and represented them.

Perhaps you're into blogging, article writing, or even looking to do some optimization on your videos in order to get them ranked. Whether it's one of the previous 3 or all of them, you are certainly in the right place. This product has worked wonders for me and I've never had a problem with it therefore I will recommend it.\n\nSpinRewriter 4.0 Review\n\nFrom personal experience, I like the products 3.0 version because it is reliable and is widely used by a lot of marketers and article writers when it comes to syndicating content. The product quickly spins a nice written piece of content that you created into a completely different article using different words that get the same points across as your original writing and has the option to keep keywords the same in order to keep the content optimized.\n \nSpinRewriter 4.0 Review\n\nNow why would you want to rewrite or \"spin\" your content when syndicating? Well the search engines simply don't like duplicate content floating around the web. To them, this is seen as spam and could actually hurt all the hard work you put into creating the original piece of content. With tis product you can literally take that original piece of writing and turn it into multiple pieces of content so that it is not seen as spam.\n\nSpinRewriter 4.0 Review\n\nhttp://vufind.org/wiki/\nhttp://wiki.usni.org/\nhttp://wiki.laptop.org/\nhttp://www.wikis.ala.org/yalsa/\n\nSpin rewriter review\nspin rewriter scam\nspin rewriter testimonial\nspin rewriter product review\nspin rewriter warrior forum\nspin rewriter discount\nspin rewriter vs the best spinner\nspin rewriter review\nspin rewriter free download\nspin rewriter wordpress plugin\nspin rewriter blackhat\nspin rewriter crack\nSpin Rewriter 4.0 Review - Discount - Bonus\nSpin Rewriter 4.0\nSpin Rewriter 4.0 Review - FREE Alternative to Spin Rewriter 4.0\nSpin Rewriter 4.0 Contest - Get Your $77 Licence For FREE\nSpin Rewriter 4.0 review Simon Greenhalgh", "title": "Spin Rewriter 4.0 Review | Is Spin Rewriter 4.0 All Hype?", "publishedDate": "2013-10-16T21:18:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9DwjwDpUams", "description": "", "title": "Stoker - Piano Scene", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T14:46:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Dx4POpDaw8", "description": "Et voici les premi\u00e8res images in-game de pok\u00e9mon version noire et blanche.

He published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books. He advocated scientifically skeptical inquiry and the scientific method, pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI).\nCarl Sagan played a leading role in the American space program since its inception. He was a consultant and adviser to NASA beginning in the 1950s, he briefed the Apollo astronauts before their flights to the Moon, and was an experimenter on the Mariner, Viking, Voyager, and Galileo expeditions to the planets. He helped solve the mysteries of the high temperature of Venus (a massive greenhouse effect), the seasonal changes on Mars (windblown dust) and the reddish haze of Titan (complex organic molecules).\n\nFor his work, Dr. Sagan received the NASA Medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and for Distinguished Public Service twice, as well as the NASA Apollo Achievement Award.\n\nAsteroid 2709 Sagan is named after him. He was also given the John F. Kennedy Astronautics Award of the American Astronautical Society, the Explorers Club 75th Anniversary Award, the Konstantin Tsiolokovsky Medal of the Soviet Cosmonautics Federation, and the Masursky Award of the American Astronomical Society:\n\n\"...for his extraordinary contributions to the development of planetary science... As a scientist trained in both astronomy and biology, Dr. Sagan made seminal contributions to the study of planetary atmospheres, planetary surfaces, the history of the Earth, and exobiology. Many of the most productive planetary scientists working today are his present and former students and associates.\" He is also the 1994 recipient of the Public Welfare Medal, the highest award of the National Academy of Sciences for \"distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare.\"", "title": "Carl Sagan's last interview (part 3 of 3).flv", "publishedDate": "2012-03-11T12:57:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9E3Si8FWb18", "description": "Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk, chairman of Tesla Motors, talks to Bloomberg Television's Guy Johnson at the opening of the company's first retail store in London.

After attracting media attention, Antin negotiated a record deal with Interscope Records in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton and Kimberly Wyatt. Overseen by Antin, Interscope and various partners, the group was transformed into a global image and commercial brand. The Pussycat Dolls were launched into mainstream recognition following the release of PCD, which contained the number-one singles \"Don't Cha\", \"Buttons\", and \"Stickwitu\". However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the overemphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead member, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album Doll Domination, which contains singles \"When I Grow Up\", \"I Hate This Part\" and \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\".\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pussycat_Dolls\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nThe_Pussycat_Dolls_-_Stickwitu.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickwitu\n\nThe_Pussycat_Dolls-Beep.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beep_(The_Pussycat_Dolls_song)\n\nThe_Pussycat_Dolls_-_Sway.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Pussycat_Dolls_-_Sway.png\n\nPussycatdolls_single_05_buttons(4).jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttons_(The_Pussycat_Dolls_song)\n\nGirlicious.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pussycat_Dolls_Present:_Girlicious", "title": "All About - The Pussycat Dolls", "publishedDate": "2014-10-19T09:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9EPxqKpKUBo", "description": "Two Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) calling out from their nest.

First, I'll explain what trunk club is. Then I'll show you what I received from them. Finally, I'll tell you my thoughts on my first Trunk Club experience. \nYou may be curious as to what Trunk Club really is. It's essentially a free personal stylist and shopper. You tell them a little bit about yourself and send a picture. Your stylist picks out the clothes for you. Your trunk is shipped to your address. You try on the clothes and buy the pieces you want. Then you send back the clothes you don't want within ten days. Other services make you pay for the personal stylist and also have shorter return periods. Shopping is time consuming. Sometimes retail locations don't have your size or the color you want. This service is great for someone like me. I don't live in or near the city. I don't have time to go shopping. \n\n What's in the trunk? A nice handwritten note by my stylist, return instructions and shipping label, the inventory list and the clothes. There are 3 pairs of chinos, khaki, blue and salmon. There are 3 pairs of socks. There are 3 plaid button down shirts. Two V-neck Sweaters, a buttonless polo, and a super soft hoodie. 13 items in total. \n\nI'm six foot six and skinny. It's not easy for me to find clothes that fit right. My stylist did an excellent job of picking clothes that fit me perfectly. Your stylist might not get it right the first time, like mine did. But there's an easy fix to that. Just let them know and send back the clothes. Just like other services, the more they get to know your likes and dislikes, the better their picks will be. The prices of the clothes are a little more than I would normally spend. I would compare their prices to retail prices of Nordstrom. There wasn't much mark up on the clothes if you were to buy them directly from the clothing brand's website. \n\nIf you found this review helpful you can share this video to someone who would benefit from it.

Some have suggested that he was born in 1569 because of the fact that he was admitted to the London Charterhouse in 1629, a pre-requisite to which was being at least 60 years old, though there is no certainty over this. He had made his living as a professional soldier, probably as a mercenary. He was an officer with the Swedish and Russian armies.\n\nHis pulished music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the lyra viol) and songs. They were gathered in two collections, The First Part of Ayres (or Musicall Humors, 1605) and Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke (1607). He was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant lute, something which caused John Dowland to publish a rebuttal of Hume's ideas.\n\nsource: http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/tobias-hume/\nor this:\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/drtkaufmanartsandmusic/tobias-hume\nernst stolz viola da gamba", "title": "A Pavin by Tobias Hume bass viol solo", "publishedDate": "2010-04-05T16:55:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9EbITuw95Oc", "description": "Meet the man who runs the Great Bustard Group - and see his bustards.

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "science show & scientist mihir kumar panda  4", "publishedDate": "2011-05-20T18:29:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Eljvo3wpHE", "description": "Learn how to void checks in Intuit QuickBooks at www.teachUcomp.com.

Most Threshold students have multiple factors labeling them \"at-risk\" of failure in school.  The Academy (a free public school managed by a non-profit organization) was created to serve students in need of a supportive program to succeed academically, socially and behaviorally.  Unfortunately, the authorizer has cancelled our contract as of June 30, 2014. Without an authorizer, the school has to close. \n\nThe song \"Everyday Learners\" helps us see that every child deserves a school that meets their needs.  Most people are not rich, famous or powerful -- we are just everyday people. Our students are everyday learners. They attend school daily, despite challenges at home, work hard and do their personal best.  Sly & the Family Stone's message was about peace and equality through music.  Threshold Academy's message is about self-sufficiency (breaking the cycle of generational poverty) through academic and character education.\n  \nOur students thrive in an environment where they are loved, cared for and respected.  ALL students are welcome here.  All students have friends and are accepted.  Our staff focuses on respect, responsibility and safety -- as well as learning.  We are helping to teach students to be good people as well as good students.  We believe all children can learn and succeed, with enough support. \nMost people have stability, identity and love through their families.  Many of our students obtain their stability, identity and/or love through their school.  With a free/reduced lunch count of 97% and about 31% of our students designated homeless, these students know about overcoming challenges and adversity.  They believe they can help save their school that has helped to save them from failure.\n  \nOur theme for 2013-14 is \"Mission Possible\" because our mission to help students to become hard workers, law abiding citizens, loving family members and successful through high school is very challenging but it is possible.\n\nThe school is on an improvement path with a goal of, someday, being a \"beating the odds\" school.  The families of Threshold request your help in saving the school or our \"Mission Possible\" becomes \"Mission Aborted.\" \n\nLearn more about Threshold Academy through our website, www.thresholdacademy.org or our Facebook page http://www.facebook.com/pages/Threshold-Academy/134446048456\n\nThe mission of Threshold Academy is the education and social development of children who will most benefit from a nurturing program based on the individual needs of the child.\n\nMusic:  The music and lyrics of \"Everyday Learner\" are based on \"Everyday People from Sly and the Family stone.  You may purchase Sly or Joan Jett's version of the song through many retailers. Please note we don't own the rights to the original song but retain the copyright to the lyrics of \"Everyday Learner.\"  I don't own the music. This video is in no way meant to infringe copyright laws. No harm intended by publishing video.\n\nThank you, Sly Stone, for the original \"Everyday People\" song and the vision of all people getting along with one another.   The song is one of Sly Stone's pleas for peace and equality between differing races and social groups, a major theme and focus for the band.

Estas viendo una parte del curso de Ingles Basico Yes en Ingles por Alberto Carranza.\n\nEl uso de Much, Many y a Lot of que en espa\u00f1ol corresponden a (Mucho, Muchos y Mucho/Muchos) est\u00e1 determinado por la cantidad de sustantivos de los que estemos hablando. Hay que tener en cuenta que se hace distinci\u00f3n de la naturaleza en singular y plural del sustantivo. Para este tema se debe tener en cuenta si se habla de sustantivos contables o no contables. \n\nUso de \"Much\"\n\nCon la palabra \"much\" (mucho, mucha) estamos haciendo referencia a un sustantivo en singular que no se puede contar, en esencia un sustantivo no contable:\n\nEjemplos:\nMuch milk        (mucha leche)\nMuch time       (mucho tiempo)\nMuch capacity (mucha capacidad)\nMuch energy   (mucha energ\u00eda)\nMuch water     (mucha agua)\n\nUso de \"Many\"\n\nCon \"many\" (muchos, muchas) indicamos a sustantivos que est\u00e1n en plural y que se pueden contar, sustantivos contables:\n\nEjemplos:\nMany apples     (muchas manzanas)\nMany cars         (muchos autos)\nMany hours      (muchas horas)\nMany people    (muchas personas)\nMany friends    (muchos amigos)\n\nPor ultimo. Uso de \"A lot of\"\n\nCon \"A lot of\" podemos hacer referencia a sustantivos en singular y plural por igual por lo que este significa: mucho (a) o muchos (as). Con este se puede hablar de sustantivos contables y no contables.\n\nEjemplos:\nA lot of time     (mucho tiempo)\nA lot of cars      (muchos autos)\nA lot of friends (muchos amigos)\nA lot of milk      (mucha leche)\nA lot of hours    (muchas horas)\n\nEso es lo basico, muchas personas utilizan \"lots of\", hay que tener en cuenta que ese se utiliza igualmente que \"\u00c4 lot of\", podemos decir...\n\nY bien, en resumen la diferencia principal de estas tres formas de expresar una cantidad grande del sustantivo es que con \"much\" s\u00f3lo hablamos en singular sustantivos no contables, con \"many\" \u00fanicamente en plural sustantivos contables y con \"a lot of\" podemos referirnos a ambos casos.\n\nEstad a atentos a nuevos videos, puedes suscribirte para no perderte ninguno y es de agradecerse que indiques like o lo compartas. \n\nHasta la pr\u00f3xima.", "title": "Uso de Much, Many y a Lot of - Lots of, Sustantivos Contables y No C. \"Yes en Ingl\u00e9s 1\" [Video 18]", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T22:33:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9F2qFmauz7M", "description": "Somlandela - Rebecca Malope pendant la c\u00e9lebration de c'est 30 ans de carri\u00e8re.", "title": "Rebeca Malope - Somlandela.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T16:18:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9F33g8xf4Vg", "description": "", "title": "Aspius 45 C&R !!!", "publishedDate": "2014-03-30T19:22:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9F366SLBCQU", "description": "", "title": "Cesaro Wins The Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T03:01:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "9F3GsNBe3VM", "description": "\u03a0\u03a5\u039b\u0391\u0399\u0391 \u0398\u0395\u03a3\u03a3\u0391\u039b\u039f\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0397\u03a3 - 500m posle, \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434, ut\u00e1n, after, IKEA\n\u039b\u03b5\u03c9\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 128,\n57001 \u03a0\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2\n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb. 2310 365010\n\u03a0\u03a5\u039b\u0391\u0399\u0391 \u0398\u0395\u03a3\u03a3\u0391\u039b\u039f\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0397\u03a3\n  0-24h\nLeuforos Jorgikis Kolis 128\nTel.2310365010\nPilea Thesaloniki\nGPS: 40.55025, 22.98250", "title": "CNG Thesaloniki - \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d", "publishedDate": "2014-07-05T13:37:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9F3H3za5S8g", "description": "Direct Hits available now - http://smarturl.it/iDirectHitsDLX\nMusic video by The Killers performing The Killers Direct Hits.

If you were to measure the voltage across a diode and the current passing through it and plot it on a graph it would look something like this. As you can see, when you flip the diode the other way, there is a very high resistance.\n\nA light-emitting diode, LED, produces light when a current flows through it in the forward direction. Because they use so little energy and last a substantial time longer than conventional filament bulbs, they are becoming more popular.\n\nThermistors are used as temperature sensors, for example in fire alarms. They are made from semiconducting materials that lower resistance as they increase in temperature. So when things get hot, the current passes through them and the alarm is triggered. Besides they're cool because the symbol looks like it's playing hockey (joke courtesy of Samuel Ashcroft). \n\nLight dependant resistors or LDRs are used to detect light levels. Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases. So when it's bright, the current flows through it more easily.

Amazing animals.\n\nSea turtles, along with other turtles and tortoises, are part of the order Testudines.\n\nThe seven living species of sea turtles are: flatback sea turtle, green sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, Kemp's ridley sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle and olive ridley sea turtle.[3] All species except the leatherback are in the family Cheloniidae. The leatherback belongs to the family Dermochelyidae and is its only member.\n\nThe species are primarily distinguished by their anatomy: for instance, the prefrontal scales on the head, the number of and shape of scutes on the carapace, and the type of inframarginal scutes on the plastron. The leatherback is the only sea turtle that does not have a hard shell; instead, it bears a mosaic of bony plates beneath its leathery skin. It is the largest sea turtle, measuring 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) in length at maturity, and 3 to 5 feet (0.91 to 1.5 m) in width, weighing up to 1,300 pounds (590 kg). Other species are smaller, being mostly 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.2 m) and proportionally narrower.\n\nExplore More:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_turtle", "title": "Scuba Diving with a Sea Turtle on the Great Barrier Reef 2", "publishedDate": "2010-01-28T09:12:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FOmokvOtHA", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Condyloma.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Condyloma", "publishedDate": "2013-08-07T06:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FOoe8KQwyc", "description": "Another test animation with R2.", "title": "R2-D2 Animation 3", "publishedDate": "2009-11-28T01:47:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FOqIwBxumE", "description": "As a college football player Harold was used to playing through injuries, including 'stingers' -- an injury resulting in intense, needle-prickling sensations and numbness in his shoulder.

Levinson, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, noted that such drugs \u2014 which include Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Abilify and Geodon \u2014 are \"potentially lethal\" to many of the patients and that some drug manufacturers illegally marketed their medicines for these uses \"putting profits before safety.\" \n\nIn response to some backlash from the audit, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that some of the inappropriate use of antipsychotics in elderly nursing home patients is a result of drug makers' paying kickbacks to nursing homes to increase prescriptions for the medicines.\n\nOmnicare Inc., a pharmacy chain for nursing homes, paid $98 million in November 2009 to settle accusations that it received kickbacks from Johnson & Johnson and other drug makers for antipsychotic prescriptions.\n\nThe government auditors found that of the 2.1 million elderly patients in nursing homes during the first six months of 2007, 304,983 had at least one Medicare claim for an antipsychotic medicine. Nursing home residents received 20 percent of the 8.5 million claims for antipsychotic medicines for all Medicare beneficiaries at a cost of $309 million during those six months.\n\nThe auditors found that 83 percent of antipsychotic prescriptions for elderly nursing home residents were for uses not approved by federal drug regulators, and 88 percent were to treat patients with dementia \u2014 for whom the drugs can be lethal.\n\nDrug interactions, over-prescribing, under-prescribing - these are huge issues. In fact my mom's recent surgery rehabilitation has been prolonged because of this confusion. You need a good patient advocate in your corner to track these issues.

Symptoms typically include rectal bleeding and anemia which are sometimes associated with weight loss and changes in bowel habits.\nMost colorectal cancer occurs due to lifestyle and increasing age with only a minority of cases associated with underlying genetic disorders. It typically starts in the lining of the bowel and if left untreated, can grow into the muscle layers underneath, and then through the bowel wall. Screening is effective at decreasing the chance of dying from colorectal cancer and is recommended starting at the age of 50 and continuing until a person is 75 years old. Localized bowel cancer is usually diagnosed through sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\nCancers that are confined within the wall of the colon are often curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely around the body is usually not curable and management then focuses on extending the person's life via chemotherapy and improving quality of life. Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, but it is more common in developed countries.[1] Around 60% of cases were diagnosed in the developed world.[1] It is estimated that worldwide, in 2008, 1.23 million new cases of colorectal cancer were clinically diagnosed, and that it killed 608,000 people", "title": "Lung Cancer", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T06:05:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FZVv_WvYCc", "description": "Un chant d'amour (ossia \"Un canto d'amore\"), film prodotto grazie a Nikos Papatakis (il regista de Les equilibristes), \u00e8 l'unico film realizzato da Jean Genet insieme alla scrittrice, regista e socialite   Polyanna Magellana Trampolini Brioschi della Ferla", "title": "Jean Genet et Polyanna Magellana Trampolini della Ferla: Un chant d'amour", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T06:25:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FZrJ19KGJc", "description": "Papa C-Diddy & The $enator...

The PEN series has been somewhat overshadowed by the excellent OM-D cameras, whose DSLR-like styling has been better received than the rangefinder-esque PENs, but the PL7 makes a bid to reaffirm the position of the smaller cameras.\n\nThe latest model adds several significant improvements over its predecessor, not least a revised shutter mechanism, a full control dial on the top plate and a 3:2 rear display. The shutter mechanism reduces the image shake that has blunted the appeal of previous models while the addition of a control dial should enhance the experience for users wanting to take control of the camera. The squarer display, meanwhile, is a better balance between the shape of the camera's stills and movie output - meaning more of the screen is used.\n\n-E-PL7 key features\n\n  *16MP Four Thirds CMOS sensor\n  *Top-plate control dial\n  *8 fps continuous shooting\n  *Tilting 1.04M dot 3:2 LCD touchscreen\n  *Larger-capacity 8.5Wh battery\n  *Wi-Fi allowing remote control and file transfer to smartphones\n  *Focus peaking\n  *'3-axis' image stabilization\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Keywords:\ne-pl7\ne-pl7 review\ne-pl6\nepl 7\nepl7\nepl7 review\nget olympus\nlower cost\nolympus camera reviews\nolympus e\nolympus e-p7\nolympus e-pl2\nolympus e-pl7\nolympus e-pl7 review\nolympus e-pl6\nolympus e-pm2\nolympus e-pm2 review\nolympus epl\nolympus epl 7\nolympus epl7\nolympus epl7 review\nolympus micro four thirds\nolympus p7\nolympus pen\nolympus pen 7\nolympus pen camera\nolympus pen d\nolympus pen e-pl2\nolympus pen e-pl7 review\nolympus pen e-pm2\nolympus pen e-pm2 review\nolympus pen epl1\nolympus pen epl7\nolympus pen lenses\nolympus pen lite\nolympus pen lite e-pl7\nolympus pen pl7\nolympus pen review\nolympus pl7\nom-d olympus\nomd olympus\npen e-pl7\npen e-pm2\npen epl7\npen lite\npen lite e-pl7\npl-7\npl7\npl6\nthe olympus\n camera digital nikon \n cameras \n compact system cameras \n digital cameras \n fujifilm camera \n micro four thirds lenses \n nikon 1 \n nikon camera \n nikon cameras \n nikon digital camera \n nikon digital cameras \n olympus camera \n olympus cameras \n olympus digital camera \n olympus e-p7 \n olympus e-pl7 \n olympus epl7 \n olympus om-d \n olympus pen \n olympus pen e-p7 \n olympus pen e-pl1 \n olympus pen e-pl7 \n olympus pen lite e-pl7 \n olympus tough \n pen camera \n pentax camera \n\nVideo URL: http://youtu.be/9FldNFrixKU", "title": "** Olympus PEN E-PL7 ready for a selfie ** | Olympus PEN E-PL7 Preview", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T23:39:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FliqU7YjXk", "description": "Promo Video", "title": "Kyosho Vintage Big Scale Buggies and Cars 1:5 \u4eac\u5546", "publishedDate": "2007-11-13T18:33:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FmGezI8qh0", "description": "I was looking for glucosamine that was a good value and found these at costco.

Gilmore, Steve Nicolaides, Rachel Pfeffer, Rob Reiner, Andrew Scheinman, Jeffrey Stott\nScreenwriter: Aaron Sorkin\nFilm Description: In this military courtroom drama based on the play by Aaron Sorkin, Navy lawyer Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is assigned to defend two Marines, Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), who are accused of the murder of fellow leatherneck Pfc. William Santiago (Michael de Lorenzo) at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kaffee generally plea bargains for his clients rather than bring them to trial, which is probably why he was assigned this potentially embarassing case, but when Lt. Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) is assigned to assist Kaffee, she is convinced that there's more to the matter than they've been led to believe and convinces her colleague that the case should go to court. Under questioning, Downey and Dawson reveal that Santiago died in the midst of a hazing ritual known as \"Code Red\" after he threatened to inform higher authorities that Dawson opened fire on a Cuban watchtower. They also state that the \"Code Red\" was performed under the orders of Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). Kendrick's superior, tough-as-nails Col. Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson), denies any knowledge of the order to torture Santiago, but when Lt. Col. Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh) confides to Kaffee that Jessup demanded the \"Code Red\" for violating his order of silence, Kaffee and Galloway have to find a way to prove this in court. A Few Good Men also features Kevin Bacon as prosecuting attorney Capt. Jack Ross and Kevin Pollak as Kaffee and Galloway's research assistant, Lt. Sam Weinberg.\n\n\"a few good men\",\"a few good men clip\",\"a few good men part 1\",\"a few good men trailer\",\"tom cruise\",\"jack nicholson\",\"kevin bacon\",\"ja preston\",\"courtroom dramas\",drama,\"military war dramas\",\"jeffrey stott\",\"rob reiner\",\"andrew scheinman\",\"william s gilmore\",\"david brown\",\"steve nicolaides\",\"rachel pfeffer\",\"authority videos\",\"justice videos\",\"truth videos\",\"courtroom videos\",\"lt daniel kaffee\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++17098,/m/07r1h,/m/09fb5,/m/04954,/m/0640v_3", "title": "You Can't Handle the Truth! - A Few Good Men (7/8) Movie CLIP (1992) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T18:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9FoU1iLPjOA", "description": "", "title": "Dimash - Shake", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04T19:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Fobzn_sjFA", "description": "7 eleven worker refuses to bag a mans purchase", "title": "7 eleven worker refuses ring up a mans purchase", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T21:06:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Fofw9ISkak", "description": "GTA 5 SOLO Money Glitch - SOLO GTA V 1.17 Money Glitch \"Unlimited Money Glitch\" (GTA 5 1.17 Money Glitch) After Patch 1.17!

The collaboration began back in October 2009 when an MDA staff member contacted Shannon Gilley, a faculty member and 3-D digital artist at Aii. Gilley and his students began creating rough sketches based on the concept Cycle of Destruction  an idea that intended to show the entire life cycle of EAB while connecting its potential for killing ash trees. \n\nAfter many sketches and a handful of revisions, the final draft was created in late March 2010 with assistance with sound design and soundtrack from McNally Smith College of Music faculty member Chris Cunningham and his students. This 30-second video is a unique specimen of technical communication in that it compresses a large amount of visual information into a small amount of time.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

Vineyards from the finest crus that tradition attested to were bought. Plots of land were also bought and planted with selected clones of Aglianico. Antonio's son, Pino, is now at the helm supported by his father and by Professor Moio. A new cellar (for vinification, bottling and storage) was completed in 2006. The total surface is of 1,700 square meters on two levels. The equipment is extremely modern: all the stainless steel vats have temperature control, there are four rotary fermentors, a cooling exchanger, pneumatic presses and a complete bottling line.

Wilson, Michael Leeson\nFilm Description: Clothes make the superspy in this high-energy action comedy. Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret -- when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong. The Tuxedo marked the feature-film debut for director Kevin Donovan, who had previously won international acclaim for his work in television commercials.\n\n\"the tuxedo\",\"the tuxedo clip\",\"the tuxedo full movie\",\"the tuxedo part 1\",\"jackie chan\",\"kevin donovan\",\"suit videos\",\"sword videos\",\"watch videos\",\"action adventure\",comedy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",thriller,\"walter f parkes\",\"william s beasley\",\"adam schroeder\",\"laurie macdonald\",\"david coatsworth\",\"solon so\",\"john h williams\",\"willie chan\",\"brandi mcdougall neuwirth\",\"discovery videos\",\"transformation videos\",\"bedroom videos\",\"mansion videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++261092,/m/012d40", "title": "The Tuxedo (3/9) Movie CLIP - Suit Demonstration (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T03:26:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GF7pkWq4tY", "description": "", "title": "Neosporin - Kid's Compare Cuts", "publishedDate": "2012-06-26T14:22:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GFInvbVCXY", "description": "Watch more How to Play Heavy Metal Guitar videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/506449-How-to-Play-the-Natural-Minor-Scale-Heavy-Metal-Guitar\n\nLet musician Alex Skolnick teach you how to play the minor pentatonic scale on guitar in this heavy metal guitar lesson from Howcast.\n\n\nOkay, what exactly is the minor pentatonic scale? Well, it's a five note scale, and there are two notes per string. So, if I take a seven note scale, A natural minor for example, and I remove the second and the sixth, I get this five note scale. Really all that it is, is a simplified version of a minor scale. \n\nSo, if I just play up the scale and down it's like this. I'm always keeping my index finger to the left, so there's a straight line right here. No matter where the scale is. Now, I could move this to any place on the neck, and it'll look the same. But for now we're at the fifth fret. So, index finger is always to the left, and I'm using my fourth finger when there are three frets, and I'm using my second finger when there's a two fret interval.\n\nIf you have big hands you have the option to use the third finger instead of the second finger. However, I prefer the fourth finger just because it gives you options in case you want to throw in some other notes with the third finger. \n\nOkay. So, you can do some variations on that. You could skip notes. So, if you do every other note instead of doing the scale in order, you get this. \n\nThe scale is very good for bending. If I do a bend on the first string in this position I get this. Second string. Third string. Put these together and you have possibilities for a lot of licks such as this.", "title": "How to Play the Minor Pentatonic Scale | Heavy Metal Guitar", "publishedDate": "2013-05-18T19:13:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GFPE3hNVPI", "description": "", "title": "Power Discharge Clipped with Fear Gas", "publishedDate": "2013-04-26T11:10:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GFhZPDaaag", "description": "High Quality", "title": "\u266a WO IST MEIN WEIZENBIER ? \u266a * * * * * Eddy Holland", "publishedDate": "2010-07-25T10:45:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GFri5VQeE4", "description": "Performed By Kent Carlevi I uploaded this video because his profile was removed/banned due to Stage Three Music contacting YouTube for reasons of breaching copyright.\n\nUPDATE: A lot of people have asked what happened with my Youtube account.\nThe short version is I uploaded three ZZ Top covers, La Grange, Rough Boy and Tush in 2008. After about two years Stage Three Music, representing ZZ Top, filed three separate complaints and Youtube pulled them one by one and closed my account saying I repeatedly uploaded copyrighted material (I uploaded all three the same day by the way). S.T.M emailed Youtube saying they had no objection with Youtube reinstating my account but the ZZ Top songs should be taken offline (which I agreed to). Youtube claimed federal law prevented them to reinstate the account unless S.T.M withdrew one of the complaints, something they weren't willing to do. And that was that.\n\nBMG acquired Stage Three Music recently and I've reached out to them hoping they look at things differently.

First we reached Duiker, a village sprawled up the side of the mountains with hundreds of tiny terraced fields for growing potatoes. There were also hundreds of fruit and nut trees, many of which were in blossom. At the highest point of the day, at about 4,500m, we had amazing views of my beloved Mt Rakaposhi (7,790m), Diran Peak (7,265m), Ultar Peak (7,388m), Golden Peak (7,028m) and Mulabiting (7,458m). We also bumped into Nori, a lone Japanese tourist. He sat with us over lunch and then joined us as we made our way back down, stopping on the way to enjoy a cup of mountain tea at the Eagle Nest Hotel. This evening some local musicians had been persuaded to play their music at the hotel. It sounded more like a cat being strangled to me but the locals obviously loved it, and loved dancing to it - only the men of course\" ...\n\n- \"10  The terraced fields at Altit\" by Marjorieandpaul from a blog titled \"Northern Pakistan\"\nExcerpt: \"In August of 1993 my wife Marjorie and I signed up for a mountain biking expedition in northern Pakistan.

True Facts About The Octopus\n True Facts About The Octopus True Facts About The Octopus\nThe octopus inhabits many diverse regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the ocean floor.

The name of the new pope, the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, by tradition would not be revealed until a celebratory announcement on a white balcony on the front of St. Peter's Basilica.\n\n\"Habemus papam!,\" members of the crowd shouted in Latin, waving umbrellas and flags. \"We have a pope!\" Others cried \"Viva il Papa!\" as all eyes trained on the balcony.\n\n\"It was like waiting for the birth of a baby, only better, \" said a Roman man. A child sitting atop his father's shoulders waved a crucifix.\n\nThe new pope inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during his predecessor, Benedict XVI \u2014 from a priest shortage and growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere where most of the world's Catholics live, to a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the church's moral authority in the West, to difficulties governing the Vatican itself.\n\nBenedict abruptly ended his troubled eight-year papacy last month, announcing he was no longer up to the rigors of the job. He became the first pontiff in 598 years to resign. The 115 cardinals who are under the age of 80 and eligible to vote chose their new leader after two days of voting.\n\nBefore beginning the voting by secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel on Tuesday, in a cloistered meeting known as a conclave, the cardinals swore an oath of secrecy in Latin, a rite designed to protect deliberations from outside scrutiny \u2014 and to protect cardinals from earthly influence as they seek divine guidance.\n\nThe conclave followed more than a week of intense, broader discussions among the world's cardinals where they discussed the problems facing the church and their criteria for its next leader.\n\n\"We spoke among ourselves in an exceptional and free way, with great truth, about the lights, but also about shadows in the current situation of the Catholic Church,\" Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn of Vienna, a theologian known for his intellect and his pastoral touch, told reporters earlier this week.\n\n\"The pope's election is something substantially different from a political election,\" Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn said, adding that the role was not \"the chief executive of a multinational company, but the spiritual head of a community of believers.\"\n\nIndeed, Benedict was selected in 2005 as a caretaker after the momentous papacy of John Paul II, but the shy theologian appeared to show little inclination toward management. His papacy suffered from crises of communications \u2014 with Muslims, Jews and Anglicans \u2014 that, along with a sex abuse crisis that raged back to life in Europe in 2010, evolved into a crisis of governance.", "title": "Vatikan: Neuer Papst Gew\u00e4hlt | Jorge Mario Bergoglio | 2013 OFFICIAL", "publishedDate": "2013-03-13T21:34:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GMTnKHNNaU", "description": "Congress needs to pass a Bill that would prevent any future President from being able to pardon Barry.

The plants tend to release oxygen into the water which is great for aeration for your fish. Also, during the process, the plants act as natural filtration in your fish tank. Aquatic plants use ammonia, co2, and nitrates, among other things, to grow. Therefore making your tank much more suitable for fish and other forms of life. \n\nThis video is just my thoughts on the process and how my 55g plated rainbow tank is overstocked and has 0 nitrate reading on a daily basis.

I'm just\nin the middle of a phone interview.\n\nMIKE\nUh, Jeff...don't you think you should be doing it somewhere where you have a little more privacy?  And is the\nwine really necessary?  Hey, are they still on the line?  Oh man.\n\nJEFF\nIt's fine...they don't know I'm drinking and I pressed the mute button.  Anyway let me finish.  Hi it's Jeff.  Hello?\nHello?\n\nMIKE\nForget to press the mute button, didn't you?\n\nJEFF\nUmmm...oops.\n\nMIKE\nWell folks, as you can see, Jeff really didn't execute that phone interview properly.  And from what we hear,\nhe's not the only one who needs to brush up on his phone interview skills.\n\nJEFF\nThat's right Mike, we've been getting a lot of people asking us about phone interviews, so today in this video we are going to\ngive you our Top 5 tips to remember when doing a phone interview.\n\nMIKE\nThe first thing to remember is to be prepared!  Before the interview, you should definitely do some research on \nthe company you are interviewing with, and take good notes.  Their website is a great place to start! You want to get a good idea of who they are and what they do!  \nAnd It's always a good idea to know who their competitors are too. Also, make sure that you've\nstudied the job description. \n\nJEFF\nNumber 2 on the list is pick a quiet place where you won't be interrupted.  You don't want to be interrupted by your\npets, kids, coworkers or other calls coming in!  It will make you look unprofessional and won't help with your concentration\neither.\n\nMIKE\nThird on our list is to keep your research notes from Tip #1 in front of you during the interview.  This will help you remember to bring\nup any information that you wanted to cover, but more importantly, could help you answer the tougher questions.\n\nJEFF\nOur fourth phone interview tip is to pay attention to the tone of your voice.  Always try to sound interested and engaged, because you \nwon't have the benefit of body language to help you convey your message.\n\nMIKE\nNumber 5 on the list is to make sure you prepare some questions to ask.  This is a great way to learn more about the role and the company,\nincluding what the culture is like!  But stay away from asking questions about salary, benefits and hours.  While these things are important,\nyou'll be able to speak about them in another phase of the interview process.  The phone interview is meant to see if you are a good match\nfor the company, so it's not necessary to get into too many details (unless they bring it up, of course)\n\nJEFF\nOkay, so if you remember to practice your three tips you'll be well on your way to acing your phone interview.\nBut of course, this is only half the battle.\n\nMIKE\nThat's right Jeff.  You're also going to need to know how to answer the specific questions that are asked.\nBut don't worry, because the Interview Guys have got you covered!\n\nJEFF\nWe've written a special report that will that will show you exactly how to craft perfect interview answers to any interview question.\n\nMIKE\nSo in order to get our Special Report that walks you through our proven step-by-step process for giving perfect interview answers, simply click this link:\nhttp://interviewmastersystem.com/how-to-give-perfect-interview-answers-every-time/?utm_source=PhoneTD&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=youtube", "title": "Phone Interview Tips - Top 5 Telephone Interview Tips You NEED To Be Aware Of", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T17:47:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GqudQzPUAw", "description": "Collection of Dogs semen for Artificial Insemination, Learn Insemination tips and techniques from my farm house.", "title": "Collection of Dogs semen for Artificial Insemination", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T18:24:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9GrLZa_Y3Kc", "description": "From the establishment in 1992, Sturdy has been dedicated to bring our clients the most advanced products.
