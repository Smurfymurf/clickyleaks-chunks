It's possible your agitator is worn and needs replacing. This free troubleshooting video shows step-by-step instructions on repairing a worn agitator using our agitator repair kit (cam, cogs (dog ears) and cog retainer) on top loading direct drive Whirlpool, Kenmore, Sears,  Roper, KitchenAid, Estate, Maytag, and Inglis washing machines.  \n\nTools Needed: flathead screwdriver and a 716th socket\n\nThe agitator pivots clockwise and counterclockwise--about three-fourths of a revolution--plunging the clothes through the water to wash them. The clothes keep moving from the top of the tub down to the bottom and back again. This motion allows the detergent and water to reach every part of the clothing and loosens the soil.\n\nThe inside of the agitator--where the transmission shaft attaches--can become worn, and strip out the spline that allows the agitator to properly grip the shaft. Then the transmission shaft rotates back and forth as it should, but the agitator doesn't move properly. If this happens, you may need to replace the agitator and/or the transmission spline.\n\nSome washing machines have a special lid-switch fuse near the lid switch, inside the control panel. If this fuse blows, the washer won't fill with water until you replace the fuse. \n\nEvery day, tens of thousands of people use our advanced, easy-to-navigate, comprehensive troubleshooting and repair help system on our website- http://www.repairclinic.com/RepairHelp/Appliance-Repair-Help-Lawn-Mower-Repair-Help-Small-Engine-Repair-Help?TLSID=1803 -- for troubleshooting by symptom, finding recommended replacement parts and learning how to successfully fix their appliances, outdoor power equipment and heating and cooling equipment on their own.

Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: \"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,\" warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"jack nicholson\",\"faye dunaway\",\"john huston\",\"perry lopez\",\"belinda palmer\",\"roman polanski\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"consequences videos\",\"disillusionment videos\",\"evil videos\",\"street videos\",katherine,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/0c12h,/m/02z5bft,/m/09fb5,/m/0hwbd", "title": "Decode the Scene GAME - Jack Nicholson Faye Dunaway John Huston MOVIE CLIPS", "publishedDate": "2012-07-26T09:23:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0GSmKXwB_0M", "description": "Original Song: Pentakill - Deathfire Grasp\nPicture Link: https://uk.images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=Az_6xdcztYdTbzIAlc1NBQx.;_ylu=X3oDMTIyZGJkMW9jBHNlYwNzcgRzbGsDaW1nBG9pZANlMTQ4MjA2YmFlN2ZjZjI5ZjgwMmQxYzRlNTk5ZGExMARncG9zAzQEaXQDYmluZw--?back=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.images.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dleague%2Bof%2Blegends%2Banime%2Bveigar%26fr%3Dytff1-%26fr2%3Dpiv-web%26tab%3Dorganic%26ri%3D4&w=900&h=509&imgurl=fc05.deviantart.net%2Ffs71%2Fi%2F2011%2F057%2F2%2F6%2Fleague_of_legends_veigar_by_hyrou-d3agc27.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deviantart.com%2F%3Foffset%3D24%26view_mode%3D2%26order%3D9%26q%3Dveigar&size=69.9KB&name=%3Cb%3ELeague+of+Legends+Veigar+%3C%2Fb%3Eby+Hyrou&p=league+of+legends+anime+veigar&oid=e148206bae7fcf29f802d1c4e599da10&fr2=piv-web&fr=ytff1-&tt=%3Cb%3ELeague+of+Legends+Veigar+%3C%2Fb%3Eby+Hyrou&b=0&ni=21&no=4&ts=&tab=organic&sigr=1217vv8ue&sigb=13oimk54i&sigi=12lcqkal2&sigt=11803s3ie&sign=11803s3ie&.crumb=0y/xEcIb9Kf&fr=ytff1-&fr2=piv-web\n\nHave a song you want nightcored?

Peggy Knight Solutions creates custom made hairpieces from the highest quality human hair for victims of medical hair loss.\n\nAlopecia areata is a highly unpredictable, autoimmune skin disease that may lead to the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. This disease affects males and females of all ages and races, but it often begins in\nchildhood. This disease affects approximately 2 percent of the population, or about 4.5 million people in the United States alone.\n\nPeggy Knight Solutions is the leading provider of hair prostheses for medical hair loss. We provide realistic human hair wigs and hairpieces made from the finest quality European hair for persons with medical hair loss.\n\nYou or your loved one can swim, play sports, drive a convertible and even enjoy amusement park rides with our custom-made hair prostheses.

Alopecia or most commonly known as hair loss in kids can also be brought about as a side effect to certain medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, while some are caused by some medical treatments such chemotherapy for childhood cancers.\n\n* Alopecia aerata: kids who are suffering from this condition experience tremendous loss of hair in any of the 3 sections of the scalp, minus the scaling of the scalp or any redness. Some children who are experiencing this condition are found to have pitting of the nails. There is no dependable treatment for alopecia children, although, most children with this condition will grow their hair back within a year on their own.\n\n* Tinea capitis: this condition is caused by a fungal infection which results to the formation of patches of hair loss. The disease is also characterized by the formation of a kerion (large, red watery lump on the scalp), formation of black dot ringworm, enlarged lymph glands or scaling in the scalp. The doctor may prescribe an antifungal medication to be taken orally such as griseofulvin, which are to be taken by the child for at least 1 and a half months. This medication is to be taken along with meals rich in fat so that the absorption is enhanced. Washing your children's hair with a shampoo formulated to contain selenium sulfide in at least 2 times a week can also make them less likely to transmit the disease to others.\n\n* Traction alopecia: this is likely to happen when your child's hair is braided too tightly or if other tight hairstyles are done.\n\n* Trichotillomania: this condition is characterized when a child deliberately pulls the hair out. It eventually leaves an irregular patch of losing hair with broken off hairs of varying length. Pulling the hair deliberately can be a habit, especially during times of stress.\n\n* Congenital alopecia: newborn babies may have tiny areas of hair loss that are present at the onset of birth from a number of varying conditions, such as nevus sebaceous (a yellow-orange birthmark) and aplasia cutis congenita.\n\n* Telogen effluvium: is a condition that typically happens when young infants, as part of the natural process wherein the mature hair replaces the so called \"baby hair\". This condition may also happen in older children, typically after a few months from an experienced illness. This is usually brought about due to the interruption of the normal hair growth cycle. Many hairs tend to move from a state of growing to a state of resting. As a lot of hairs are being shed, you may notice diffuse loss of hair and it may appear like all of your child's hair is falling out.\n\nThere are some cases of alopecia children involving trauma or inflammatory reactions on the scalp can result to the formation of scars, inside where the hair actually grows. This may eventually lead to the formation of bald spot on the scalp.", "title": "How Comfortable is the PKS2 Vacuum Wig?", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T17:44:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0GrCxczLGkc", "description": "Zeer goed bewegend hengstveulen van Rhodium x Jetset d uit de Sina stam.\nSchwung, takt, lossigheid, rek, sprong, ruimte en kracht en altijd bergop!\nHet is hem aan te zien dat hij zowel goede spring- als dressuurgenen in zich heeft.\ngeb. 5-5-2014\n\nTE KOOP   Meer informatie op www.paard-en-mens.nl\nSpanga (Zuid Friesland)", "title": "Rhodium x Jetset d (Joyful Sinaman) NIEUW filmpje", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T11:16:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0GrFjPXDrX4", "description": "Panasonic - HDC - SD60.

There are several ways to turn a big-screen TV into your new computer monitor and enjoy video games, web content, and photos like never before.\n\n\nStep 1: Connect with S-Video\nFirst, connect a video cable \u2013 you've got several choices. For PC users, an easy option is an S-Video cable. Most PCs and digital televisions are equipped with an S-Video port. \n\nTip\nThe ends of S-Video cables usually feature either four or seven pins and pinholes. Check your TV and laptop ports to make sure they match. \n\nStep 2: Connect with VGA\nIf you have an older HDTV, try a VGA cable, which produces better picture quality and works with both Macs and PCs. To connect, turn off your laptop and your TV. Find the trapezoid-shaped VGA outlets on the TV and on your laptop. Once you're connected, power everything back on. \n\nTip\nMacs need a DVI- or mini-DVI-to-VGA adapter to connect the VGA cable. \n\nStep 3: Connect with DVI\nYou can also connect with a DVI video cable. A DVI connection is a step above VGA in picture quality, but only newer computers and HDTVs come with DVI ports. Connect as with a VGA cable. \n\nTip\nSome Macs require a mini-DVI-to-DVI adapter for DVI connections.\n\nStep 4: Connect with HDMI\nIf your HDTV doesn't have a DVI connector, use a cable that is HDMI on one end, and DVI on the other to connect to your laptop.\n\nStep 5: Connect audio\nHook up the audio. After you've connected your laptop to the TV via video cable, connect the mini-to-RCA cable from your computer\u2019s headphone jack to your TV. \n\nStep 6: Use a wireless converter\nA final PC option is to go wireless, using a converter box and the software that comes with it. Using a VGA cable, plug the box into your TV and install the software onto your computer. The box will then convert your computer's VGA signal to the TV, and transfer both video and audio. \n\nStep 7: Adjust display settings\nIf you have a PC, go to the Control Panel and adjust the display settings to accompany double display on both your monitor and TV set. Mac laptops should automatically adjust for double display. If yours doesn't, go to System Preferences, click on Display, and then Detect Displays. \n\nStep 8: Find your laptop\nClick your TV's video source \u2013 usually a button called \"input\" or \"TV/Video\" on your remote \u2013 until your laptop comes up. You're set!\n\nDid You Know?\nAccording to one industry prediction, by 2015 the average European household TV will measure a whopping 60 inches.", "title": "How to Connect Your Laptop to Your Television", "publishedDate": "2009-06-08T15:24:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Gzda4gkz_g", "description": "Zimmerpflanzen - Haworthia\n\nDer Gattung Haworthia sind etwa 160 bisher bekannte Arten zugeh\u00f6rig. Es handelt sich um kleinw\u00fcchsige Sukkulenten mit interessant geformten und gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00e4tter. Die fleischig dicken, stiellosen Bl\u00e4tter einer Haworthia sind rosettenf\u00f6rmig um einen fast nicht sichtbaren Stamm angeordnet.\n\nZahlreiche unterschiedliche Wuchsformen\nEinige Haworthia wachsen niedrig und kompakt, w\u00e4hrend andere recht hoch werden und mehrere Reihen \u00fcberlappender Bl\u00e4tter bilden. Je nach Art sind die Bl\u00e4tter einer Haworthia ziemlich hart und derb, bei anderen wiederum weich und fleischig. Die Oberfl\u00e4che einiger Haworthia  Arten ist mit Warzen bedeckt. Bei allen Arten der Haworthia sind die Bl\u00fcten wei\u00dflich oder blassrosa gef\u00e4rbt, r\u00f6hrenf\u00f6rmig, etwa 2 cm lang und 6 mm breit. Eine Haworthia kann fast zu jeder Jahreszeit bl\u00fchen. Haworthien sind nicht schwierig zu kultivieren und sie gedeihen im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Sukkulenten auch im Halbschatten.\n\nHaworthia cuspidata bildet mehrere niedrig wachsende, 6 bis 8 cm durchmessende Rosetten. Die dichtbebl\u00e4tterten Rosetten bestehen aus weichen, graugr\u00fcnen Bl\u00e4ttern mit harten, borstenf\u00f6rmigen Spitzen.\n\nHaworthia margaritifera hat ziemlich ledrige und dunkelgr\u00fcne Bl\u00e4tter, die mit wei\u00dfen Warzen dicht besetzt sind. Die St\u00e4mme dieser Haworthia sind sehr kurz, so dass die vielbl\u00e4ttrigen Rosetten, die einen Durchmesser von 17 cm und eine H\u00f6he von etwa 10 cm erreichen, stammlos zu sein scheinen.\n\nHaworthia reinwardtii besitzt etwa 15 cm hohe St\u00e4mme, die dicht mit lanzettlichen, derben, dunkelgr\u00fcnen und nach innen gew\u00f6lbten Bl\u00e4ttern besetzt sind. Das Einzelblatt wird etwa 3 cm lang und 1,5 cm dick und ist am Grund 1,5 cm breit; es ist, vor allem auf der sichtbaren Unterseite, dicht besetzt mit winzigen Perlwarzen. Die Blattoberseiten sind flach, die Unterseiten abgerundet und zur Spitze hin kielf\u00f6rmig gew\u00f6lbt.\n\nHaworthia tessellata w\u00e4chst mit mehreren nahezu stammlosen Rosetten, die rund 5 cm hoch und 7 cm breit werden. Die gr\u00fcnlichen Bl\u00e4tter sind am Rand gez\u00e4hnt, etwa 3 cm lang und 2 cm breit und am Grund 5 mm dick. Sie laufen zum Ende hin spitz zu. Die Blattoberseiten sind etwas abgerundet., durchscheinend und mit einem Netz wei\u00dfer Linien gemustert. Die Blattunterseiten sind von wei\u00dflichen Warzen bedeckt.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Haworthia\nLicht / Standort\n\nEine Haworthia darf niemals in direkter Sonne stehen. Wenn man die Sukkulente der Sommersonne aussetzt, schrumpfen die Bl\u00e4tter. Ein heller, halbschattiger Standort ist f\u00fcr alle Haworthia  Sorten gut geeignet.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Hauptwachstumszeit w\u00e4ssert man die Haworthia gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig. Zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben l\u00e4sst man die oberste Erdschicht abtrocknen. W\u00e4hrend der winterlichen Ruheperiode gie\u00dft man eine v gerade so viel, dass die Erde nicht vollst\u00e4ndig austrocknet.\nTemperatur\n\nDie Haworthia gedeiht bei normalen Wohnungstemperaturen. W\u00e4hrend der winterlichen Ruheperiode sollte man f\u00fcr eine Temperatur zwischen minimal 5 \u00b0C und maximal 15 \u00b0C sorgen. \nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nZur Vermehrung einer Haworthia entfernt man im Sommer die Seitensprossen, diese lassen sich problemlos abnehmen. Falls diese bereits Wurzeln ausgebildet haben, pflanzt man die Ableger direkt in Pflanzschalen und kultiviert sie wie ausgewachsene Exemplare.\n\nSeitensprosse ohne Wurzeln l\u00e4sst man etwa drei Tage abtrocknen. Dann dr\u00fcckt man die Schnittfl\u00e4che in das Substrat und kultiviert sie wie ausgewachsene Exemplare.\n\nHaworthien lassen sich auch problemlos aus Samen anziehen. Da eine  Haworthia jedoch sehr leicht Hybriden bildet, ist das  Ergebnis der Anzucht durch Samen nicht vorauszusehen.\nErde / Substrat\n\nZur Kultivierung einer Haworthia verwendet man eine Erdmischung aus einem Teil scharfem Sand und drei Teilen lockerer, grober Komposterde.\nUmtopfen\n\nDa eine Haworthia ein sich flach ausbreitendes Wurzelwerk bildet und die Sukkulente zudem zur Gruppenbildung neigt, sind flache T\u00f6pfe und Pflanzschalen am besten geeignet. Umgetopft wird eine Haworthia im zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr zu Beginn der Wachstumszeit. Man entfernt dabei alle abgestorbenen oder eingeschrumpften Bl\u00e4tter der Haworthia und versetzt die Sukkulente nur dann in eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Schale, wenn die Rosetten die Erde vollst\u00e4ndig bedecken.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nEine D\u00fcngung schadet der Haworthia  und f\u00fchrt zu einem unnat\u00fcrlichem Wachstum. Diese Sukkulenten sollten gar nicht ged\u00fcngt werden.\nHinweise zur Pflanze\n\nVorsicht, obwohl es sich bei den Haworthien um Sukkulenten handelt, \u00fcberstehen sie totale Trockenheit nicht.", "title": "Haworthia; Sukkulenten", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T22:23:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0GzgjM9fAgo", "description": "Donald L.

Built on top of a recently captured live loop variant version of \"Night Sounds\", by basing this improvised ebow piece on the song that began the show, Stafford brings the performance full circle with a return to that quiet, pureambient world of music that he is known for.\n\nUnderstated, subdued, quiet and introspective, this piece successfully concludes the event.  This was Stafford's first live performance in some time, and as such was an opportunity to both revisit some old favourites as well as present new material, both very ambient and very, very active, from forthcoming pureambient.com albums.  \n\nStafford is currently working on a new active album entitled \"gone native\", while as the same time, work continues on his next ambient record, \"sky full of stars\".  At the same time, since there was a period of careful preparation for this show, we also have the added benefit of several brand new works that either appeared during rehearsals or were intentionally created in support of this event.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed the concert, which is presented here in its entirety in unedited form.

But the planned protest hasn't gone down well with many.\nA group of volunteers gathered at Kochi's marine drive to promote the protest planned on November 2. But the placards they were carrying were torn up by some men allegedly of the Yuva Morcha who even tried to manhandle the volunteers.\n\"These people do not know the tradition of our country. We will not allow such an event to take place here,\" said one of the attackers.\nA Facebook page called 'Kiss of love' kick started the buzz over the protest. The page invited people to gather at Kochi's marine drive on November 2 and express their love by hugging or kissing their partners. Overnight, the page got thousands of likes. But police are undecided about giving the go-ahead for the event.\n\"We have decided to go ahead with this programme whatever happens. This is a message to say that the expression of love and affection in public is not a crime,\" said Rahul Pashupalan, the organiser of the event.\n\"These incidents will force women to be back in their homes, it will affect their empowerment. In other countries people greet each other by hugging. Why is it a big moral issue here,\" asked activist Mercy Alexander.\nSunday's protest is against what the organisers describe as the moral policing. Last week, a coffee shop in Kozhikode was vandalised by Yuva Morcha activists claiming that the place was facilitating immoral activities.\nThe youngsters have come forward to protest against moral policing and invasion of one's privacy even as there are doubts about obtaining a police permission and as there are threats from various places the organisers have decided to go ahead. Their only hope is that 'Kiss of love' will be able to drive home the message that the expression of love and affection in public is not a crime\n\n\nFor More Latest Videos, please check out\nFull Movies: http://goo.gl/mDS9IQ\nFilm Trailers & Events: http://goo.gl/vQ6oKl\nBreaking News: http://goo.gl/rXYPWO\n\nFilm Songs: http://goo.gl/XogNaH\nIlayaraja Music: http://goo.gl/95L4gM\nMovies in HD: http://goo.gl/xE2LWO\nHealth Videos: http://goo.gl/69rff6\nTV Shows: http://goo.gl/BQT0x5\nComedy Scenes: http://goo.gl/bpCWe2\nAction Scenes: http://goo.gl/Dk3JPF", "title": "Kiss of Love - Youth Mad about Mass Kissing Protest in Kerala", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T09:32:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0HRatDA55WY", "description": "No description. \nThis sign video was contributed by users of the ASL-STEM Forum:\n\nhttp://aslstem.cs.washington.edu/", "title": "Codon", "publishedDate": "2011-08-16T23:49:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0HSGm86hK-Q", "description": "Music video by Shanice performing When I Close My Eyes.

Lendl beat Connors in this match. These two never liked each other when they were on tour and there were a couple of incidents like that between them. After Lendl beat Connors in the Masters later in January, Connors gave Lendl the bird when Lendl walked out from a press conference and earlier gave Lendl the finger when Lendl tried to hit Connors with the ball at net.\n\nJust before the 1983 US Open final, Lendl was in the locker room with Connors' brother and Lendl bragged that he could beat Johnny at backgammon or cards or whatever. Johnny said that may be, but that Connors would beat Lendl on the court. Pretty soon everyone was piling on Lendl. Lendl then told Johnny, \"Be quiet before I kick your ass\". Jimmy, who was standing nearby listening, suddenly charges out from behind the lockers and shouts, \"I'd like to see that happen!\" Lendl grabbed his bags and got out of there in a huff. When Lendl served at set-point in the third set, you could see him smirk across the net at Connors, clearly thinking of the locker-room altercation. When Connors broke Lendl in that game, you could see Lendl yelling angrily at himself. Lendl said later that was one of his worst memories of the US Open, and the incident in the locker-room before the match contributed to that.", "title": "Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl snarling at each other", "publishedDate": "2013-05-27T01:29:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0HeI8sOPaoE", "description": "How is it that we have more SUV's and fewer dirt roads than ever before?

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. They are the only surviving proboscideans; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). These animals have several distinctive features, including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Wallis\nScreenwriter: John Huston, Dashiell Hammett\nFilm Description: After two previous film versions of Dashiell Hammett's detective classic The Maltese Falcon, Warner Bros. finally got it right in 1941--or, rather, John Huston, a long-established screenwriter making his directorial debut, got it right, simply by adhering as closely as possible to the original. Taking over from a recalcitrant George Raft, Humphrey Bogart achieved true stardom as Sam Spade, a hard-boiled San Francisco private eye who can be as unscrupulous as the next guy but also adheres to his own personal code of honor. Into the offices of the Spade & Archer detective agency sweeps a Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor), who offers a large retainer to Sam and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) if they'll protect her from someone named Floyd Thursby. The detectives believe neither Miss Wonderly nor her story, but they believe her money. Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case -- and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby. Miss Wonderly's real name turns out to be Brigid O'Shaughnessey, and, as the story continues, Sam is also introduced to the effeminate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and the fat, erudite Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his film debut). It turns out that Brigid, Cairo and Gutman are all international scoundrels, all involved in the search for a foot-high, jewel-encrusted statuette in the shape of a falcon. Though both Cairo and Gutman offer Spade small fortunes to find the \"black bird,\" they are obviously willing to commit mayhem and murder towards that goal: Gutman, for example, drugs Spade and allows his \"gunsel\" Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) to kick and beat the unconscious detective. This classic film noir detective yarn gets better with each viewing, which is more than can be said for the first two Maltese Falcons and the ill-advised 1975 \"sequel\" The Black Bird.\n\n\"the maltese falcon\",\"the maltese falcon clip\",\"the maltese falcon trailer\",\"the maltese falcon part 1\",\"humphrey bogart\",\"peter lorre\",\"mary astor\",\"john huston\",\"gun videos\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"film noir\",mystery,thriller,\"hal b wallis\",\"henry blanke\",\"aggression videos\",\"attitude videos\",\"self control videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++31035,/m/03n6r,/m/0h326,/m/02qhm3", "title": "When You're Slapped, You'll Take It & Like It - The Maltese Falcon (3/10) Movie CLIP (1941) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T20:56:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "0I2-6OurMbw", "description": "A intro for my vids not having to do with AA or my TP walkthru", "title": "New Cube Intro", "publishedDate": "2008-02-04T19:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0I22-UWABF0", "description": "", "title": "VIDEO0042", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T08:12:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0I3FpQzqInQ", "description": "This took place at the 2600/Telephreak party hosted by Andrew Strutt of 2600net.

He explains that the piece is choreography adapted for the camera, which extends the sense of what dance can be. Cunningham emphasizes that stage and camera do not compete.\n\"Beach Birds for Camera\" was filmed in 1991 in two different settings: Kaufman Astoria Studios and Industria Superstudio, both in New York City. One is filmed in black-and-white and the other in color. The piece opens with a close-up of the torsos and outstretched arms of dancers in black-and-white costumes designed by Martha Skinner. The dance is accompanied by \"Four3,\" a piece written by John Cage for Cunningham's 1991 \"Beach Birds.\" \"Four3,\" based on Erik Satie's \"Vexations,\" was played on two pianos, one in the hall and one outside, and a violin playing held tones. All four musicians added to the ethereal quality of the soundscape by playing rainsticks. As the stark opening notes of \"Four3\" sound, the camera zooms out and the viewer sees that their knees are slightly bent and their arms are swaying. As the piece progresses, there are few moments of complete synchronization of the dancers' movements. Instead the viewer's attention is pulled between different groupings of bodies moving at different paces. Unsurprisingly, the dancers read as birdlike. Their upper chests and arms are covered in black material in a way that suggests wings, while the rest of their bodies are clad in white. They stick their legs out and shake them, alternating between halting, jerky movements and fluid pli\u00e9s. The audible shuffling of the dancers' feet at once complements and challenges the primacy of Cage's composition.\n\nMUSICIANS John Cage\nDANCERS  Helen Barrow, Kimberly Bartosik, Michael Cole, Emma Diamond, Victoria Finlayson, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric (Foofwa d'Imobilit\u00e9) Gafner, Alan Good, David Kulick, Patricia Lent, Larissa McGoldrick, Randall Sanderson, Robert Swinston, Carol Teitelbaum, Jenifer Weaver\n\n\u00a9 2013 Merce Cunningham Trust.

They test not only an individual's knowledge but also the more subtle qualities, such as discrimination, judgment, and reasoning. If multiple choice tests are to be most effectively used as educational tools, they should be given to students during the course of studies and not just during the examination at the end of the course.\n\nConsidering the descriptive nature of anatomy, and the importance of illustrations in grasping and remembering anatomical relationships, diagrams are added.

The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by nearby functional groups.\n\nThe word moiety is often used synonymously to \"functional group,\" but, according to the IUPAC definition, a moiety is a part of a molecule that may include functional groups as substructures. For example, an ester is divided into an alcohol moiety and an acyl moiety, but has an ester functional group. Also, it may be divided into carboxylate and alkyl moieties.\n\nCombining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent alkanes generates a powerful systematic nomenclature for naming organic compounds.\n\nThe atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. When the group of atoms is associated with the rest of the molecule primarily by ionic forces, the group is referred to more properly as a polyatomic ion or complex ion. And all of these are called radicals, by a meaning of the term radical that predates the free radical.\n\nThe first carbon atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the alpha carbon; the second, beta carbon, the third, gamma carbon, etc. If there is another functional group at a carbon, it may be named with the Greek letter, e.g. the gamma-amine in gamma-aminobutanoic acid is on the third carbon of the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Functional Groups in Organic Compounds", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T07:12:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "0IXWjzHRxWs", "description": "", "title": "Cobweb!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T04:29:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0IXqIaNgtec", "description": "Sugar Tree met the ostrich chicks last night.\n\nSubscribe!: http://dft.ba/-camelsandfriends\nCheck out: http://www.camelsandfriends.com\nLike us on facebook: http://www.facebook.com/camelsandfriends", "title": "Sweetest Doberman meets two baby Ostriches", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T23:48:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0IY6xWOqynY", "description": "Marika Klambatsea Piano -Voice\nMy Little one  Composer - Frankie Lane", "title": "'Strange fruit ' 'MY LITTLE ONE'   Concert  Marika Klambatsea Megaro mousikis", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T21:47:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0IYIr1uvFZc", "description": "Good teams make you pay for mistakes.\n\nGreat teams take you to the cleaners.\n\nWhere Petoskey falls in that good-great scenario in 2009 is a book with many chapters yet to be written.\n\nOn Friday, when Cheboygan stumbled, the opportunistic Northmen pounced.

The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. However, the most sophisticated medieval arguments against an infinite past were developed by the Islamic philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Islamic theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).

The son of a humble hawker, Farouk had start-up capital of just R300, borrowed from his dad, when he launched Speedy Den back in 1974. He bought two sets of mag wheels, sold them at a profit, and ploughed the money back into the business to buy more stock.\n\nThe young 19-year-old soon expanded into other accessories and the used car dealers in Klerksdorp began sending their cars to the young Farouk to dress their cars up to gain a competitive advantage. \"Those first two sets of mags were Tiger wheels,\" says Farouk, \"with an aluminium centre bolted to a steel rim, and you had to protect the tubes from getting cut by the bolts, by fitting a gaiter, made from an old cut-up tube.\n\n\"After a while people asked me why I didn't sell cars myself, and so I set up in premises registered in a white guy's name, because in those days Indians weren't allowed to trade in the area. The first two years were very tough, there were no Indian dealers in the trade and we couldn't get banks to finance the deals.\n\nThen two years later, after the banks realised I was going to take a share of the market, they came to the party.\" Since those make-or-break days, Speedy Car Sales in Anderson Street, Klerksdorp, has consistently won the Absa Golden Dealer award for the past 22 years, and Farouk Dangor has been named Klerksdorp's Businessman of the Year. His name in the trade is known right across the country, and Speedy has its own car transporter to deliver cars anywhere in South Africa.\n\nMarried to Shameema, he has five children, Bilal (30), Shavira (28), Zeenat (25), Mohamed (24) and Tasneem (18). And while he describes Shameema as \"totally supportive\", the rest of his family are car-mad. Mohammed, particularly, is very keen to follow his father's example of taking to the race-tracks -- Farouk was a highly successful racing driver in the late '80s and early '90s -- and he says his youngest daughter has already decided what colour Golf GTI she wants when she gets her licence...\n\nFarouk has owned a number of exotic cars himself, and his favourites are the Nissan Skyline GTR R34, his current R35 GTR, and his all-time favourite, a Ferrari 458 Italia. farouk still owns his m3 touring car which has just undergone a complete restoration.

The Sanhedrin is the Supreme Council and Court in ancient Jerusalem. After the commander found out that Paul was a Roman citizen, he wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. He ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. (Sanhedrin: Supreme Council and Court in ancient Jerusalem). The commander then brought Paul to stand before them (Acts 22:30). Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said \"My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day\" (Acts 23:1). At this, the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth (Acts 23:2). Then Paul said to him \"God will strike you. You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!\" (Acts 23:3). Paul said \"I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead\" (Acts 23:6). When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided (Acts 23:7). The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither Angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all (Acts 23:8). There was great uproar and some of the Pharisees stood up and said \"We find nothing wrong with this man.\" They said \"What if a spirit or an Angel has spoken to him?\" (Acts 23:9). The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to take Paul away into the barracks (Acts 23:10).\nThought for today: God can do extraordinary things through ordinary people.\nThought for the future: where will you spend eternity?", "title": "#956- Paul Before The Sanhedrin", "publishedDate": "2013-04-08T04:54:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0InAg4Pm7fU", "description": "How to do the foldable and activity for page 16 in the composition notebook.", "title": "Page 16 Subject & Predicate Practice", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T20:52:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0InfkJ2gYXw", "description": "SUBSCRIBE to join the Zoneheads! \u25ba http://bit.ly/Sub2TWZ\nMore A Capellas: http://bit.ly/1lOcm6g\nWe all need a pick-me-up after the Red Wedding episode.

The cory cats like to school in a group of six or more. These cat fish come from the amazon river and tributaries. water temperature should be in the mid to high 70's. The most important feature of a cory cat are its barbs or whiskers. They use their barbs to shift through the substrate to find uneaten food. Because their barbs are fragile it is well advised to use sand that won't change the ph for  the bottom that way these fish do no scratch their bellies or damage their whiskers.  To breed the cory cat you want to do a water change about 20-25% with slightly colder water just by a few degrees.

Ni les recommandations du Conseil de l'Europe, ni celles de l'OSCE, ni celles provenant d'autres organisations intergouvernementales ne suffisent pour les pays membres ou participants \u00e0 ratifier, voir \u00e0 mettre en pratique ces d\u00e9cisions. Dans le m\u00eame temps, ni les mod\u00e8les de participations d\u00e9mocratiques, ni les actions en faveur de la citoyennet\u00e9 active ne permettent de faire \u00e9merger la moindre trace de coh\u00e9sion sociale. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est sans doute ailleurs.\n\nCes politiques pourtant tr\u00e8s valables sont malheureusement insignifiantes face \u00e0 certains acteurs politiques qui usent du sentiment de crainte, de repli sur soi et de peurs au travers d'approches populistes et haineux qui minent les bases de nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en m\u00ealant mesures simplistes et recherches de bouc \u00e9missaires.\n\nCe climat de suspicion qui est tr\u00e8s frappant \u00e0 l'Ouest de Vienne touche un nombre important de pays participants. D\u00e9sormais, nous voyons bien que la situation n\u00e9cessite une nouvelle forme d'approche et de r\u00e9flexion qui passe par une vraie force de proposition.\n\nParmi les minorit\u00e9s, qui ne sont plus vraiment des migrants, les communaut\u00e9s musulmanes sont devenues les victimes et les cibles principales de cette stigmatisation. C'est pourquoi, notre organisation COJEP International en partenariat avec l'EMISCO et d'autres organisations internationales d\u00e9cida de lancer une large consultation sur un projet d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 \u00ab la Nouvelle Europe \u00bb. Cette Europe aura pour vocation \u00e0 \u00eatre plus inclusive et plus d\u00e9mocratique. Elle sera donc plus juste et plus \u00e9quitable, ce qui lui permettra \u00e0 nouveau de devenir un territoire envi\u00e9 porteur des valeurs universelles.\n\nPour cela, il est n\u00e9cessaire de remettre les cartes sur table pour rechercher un nouveau contrat social, un nouvel accord alliant la majorit\u00e9 et les communaut\u00e9s minoritaires dans leur ensemble.\n\nEn ce qui concerne cette session, voici nos recommandations:\n\n- Le manque de participation est index\u00e9 au manque de d\u00e9sirs dans le partage du pouvoir. Il y a l\u00e0 une connexion avec l'intol\u00e9rance et cela doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9 en termes de menaces aux droits de l'homme qui est en forte relation avec le racisme et la x\u00e9nophobie en Europe.\n\n- Les visites des repr\u00e9sentants sp\u00e9ciaux dans certains pays doivent aller au-del\u00e0 des crimes haineux pour examiner \u00e9galement les discriminations, les intol\u00e9rances et le racisme ainsi que la place des minorit\u00e9s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\n- L'OSCE devrait surveiller et mettre \u00e0 jour ses plans d'actions en fonction de l'\u00e9volution actualis\u00e9e concernant l'intol\u00e9rance et la discrimination et tenir compte de nos propositions dans le cadre de la Nouvelle Europe, voir critiquer et contribuer au projet par le biais de ses experts et conseillers.\n\nNous allons aborder le sujet de la Nouvelle Europe dans une r\u00e9union parall\u00e8le qui aura lieu \u00e0 18H00 aujourd'hui dans la salle nr. 3.", "title": "Veysel FILIZ Session 11 HDIM Warsaw 03 October 2011.MP4", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T22:13:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0J1_GlGMBFc", "description": "Aktris Nikita Mirzani memendam cita-cita selama 9 tahun untuk menjadi seorang penyanyi.

Cewek cantik dan seksi itu mengaku, sejak kecil sudah menyenangi dunia tarik suara. Kesukaannya menyanyi ini ditularkan dari almarhum mamanya, yang memang gemar bernyanyi.  Namun, Nikita terjun ke musik setelah merasa yakin dengan kemampuannya menyanyi. Pilihan ini, tentu saja mendapat dukungan penuh dari  keluarga dan teman-temannya.\n\n\"Keluarga ku mendukung banget. Makanya aku pede,\" katanya sambil tertawa.\n\nNikita pertama kali terjun ke dunia entertain sebagai model, kemudian main sinetron, menjadi host dan kemudian membintangi film layar lebar. Namanya makin dikenal luas setelah menjadi host di acara stripping talk show berjudul KKN (Kakek-kakek Narsis) yang tayang di sebuah televisi swasta. Lewat lagu \"Baby I Hate U\" yang bergenre Pop dengan beat up, Nikita menawarkan konsep bermusiknya yang nakal, seksi, sekaligus fungky.

I wanted to share with you my technique when it comes to doing newspaper/magazine nails. It's very easy and final result is amazing! You don't have to only use text from magazine you can also cut out any pattern and it will transfer to your nail! How cool? Hope you guys enjoy this and let me know what you think! xo, Mima\n\n\u2022 Rhinestones used: http://www.bornprettystore.com/colors-stud-rhinestone-acrylic-nail-wbox-300pcs-p-5000.html \n\u2022 Studs used: http://www.bornprettystore.com/heart-square-elliptic-round-hollow-stud-rhinestone-acrylic-nail-wbox-p-4993.html\n*** Use coupon code MGLW10 to get 10% off! Use code at check-out! ***\n\n\n\n\nItems needed for manicure:\nBase coat\nWhite polish\nMagazines\nRubbing Alcohol \nRhinestones and studs (optional) \nTop Coat\n\n\nTIPS & TRICKS when it comes to doing newspaper/magazine nails:\n\n1. If the ink won't transfer to the nail or transfers just a little. Don't worry. You can remove the ink with water or alcohol from your nail and start again. This time leave the piece of magazine longer in alcohol. ( Sometimes you have to leave it in alcohol for 2-3 minutes. Not all magazines work the same.)\n2. Nail polish you used as base must be somewhat dry because that's the best way for ink to transfer. Sometimes fully dry base won't work. Then just re-paint thin coat of polish and wait until is about 80% dry. \n3. When you apply piece of magazine on your nail, press it and then hold it pressed for few seconds. This will make ink appear more opaque. \n4. Always finish off with top coat. Top coat will protect and make the design/text appear  more realistic!\n Hope this helps!

Agents themselves are gray. The red lines are locomotive effectors which work a little like small jets (length indicating intensity). The colorful dots within the agents are sensors (green senses food sources, blue senses obstacle, etc).\n\nThe system is based on natural selection; agents can invest their own life energy (health) into creating offspring. Initially the system keeps creating agents with random configurations and no specific functionality. Eventually, an agent will manage to collect enough energy and reproduce and establish a sustained population. From that point on evolution can occur.

It is capable of speeds over 160 km/h (100 mph) on land and 50 km/h (30 mph / 26 knots) on water. Rather than adding wheels to a boat design, or creating a floating car, the Aquada was designed from the ground up to perform very well in both fields.\n\nThe Gibbs Aquada is Powered By 2.5L Rover V6.\n\nIn 2004 Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin Group, used a Gibbs Aquada to set a new record for crossing the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle.

North American English. Free Tutorials for \" how do you pronounce\" and \"use it in a sentence\".\u00a0\n\nCommon Usage: \" Do us all a favor and shut the fuck up with your endless ass dick shit hyperbole.\"\n\nDefinition and Origin:\nhyperbole (n.)\nearly 15c., from Latin hyperbole, from Greek hyperbole \"exaggeration, extravagance,\" related to hyperballein \"to throw over or beyond,\" from hyper- \"beyond\" + bole \"a throwing, a casting, the stroke of a missile, bolt, beam,\" from bol-, nominative stem of ballein \"to throw\" (see ballistics). Rhetorical sense is found in Aristotle and Isocrates.\n\nhyperbola (n.)\n1660s, from Latinized form of Greek hyperbole \"extravagance,\" literally \"a throwing beyond\" (see hyperbole). Perhaps so called because the inclination of the plane to the base of the cone exceeds that of the side of the cone.\n\nhyperbolic (adj.) \n1640s (iperbolical is from early 15c.), from Greek hyperbolikos \"extravagant,\" from hyperbole \"extravagance,\" literally \"a throwing beyond\" (see hyperbole). Geometric sense is from 1670s. Related: Hyperbolically.\n\nliterally (adv.)\n1530s, \"in a literal sense,\" from literal + -ly (2). Erroneously used in reference to metaphors, hyperbole, etc., even by writers like Dryden and Pope, to indicate \"what follows must be taken in the strongest admissible sense\" (1680s), which is opposite to the word's real meaning and a long step down the path to the modern misuse of it.\nWe have come to such a pass with this emphasizer that where the truth would require us to insert with a strong expression 'not literally, of course, but in a manner of speaking', we do not hesitate to insert the very word we ought to be at pains to repudiate; ... such false coin makes honest traffic in words impossible. [Fowler, 1924]\n\nhype (n.)\n\"excessive or misleading publicity or advertising,\" 1967, American English (the verb is attested from 1937), probably in part a back-formation of hyperbole, but also from underworld slang sense \"swindle by overcharging or short-changing\" (1926), a back-formation of hyper \"short-change con man\" (1914), from prefix hyper- meaning \"over, to excess.\" Also possibly influenced by drug addicts' slang hype, 1913 shortening of hypodermic needle. Related: Hyped; hyping. In early 18c., hyp \"morbid depression of the spirits\" was colloquial for hypochondria (usually as the hyp or the hyps).", "title": "Use Hyperbole in a Sentence", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T02:52:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JRnM_UNLsA", "description": "http://healthydeedee.com\n\u0e42\u0e23\u0e04\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23 \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38 \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e31\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e23\u0e04 \u0e2d\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e42\u0e23\u0e04\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e15\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e25\u0e25\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 Substantia nigra pars compacta", "title": "\u0e42\u0e23\u0e04\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e19 Parkinson \u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e31\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T10:49:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JRxgxCSda4", "description": "Dallas Otologist Dr. Bob Peters with Dallas Ear Institute discusses the amazing procedure, Cochlear Implants, that he performs that enables individuals to hear.

I'm going to show you some really cool techniques for beginning crochet, and hopefully, you'll have as much fun as I have with it. Okay, lets get started. \n\nThere are two main methods for crocheting a flower. The first one is like this flower here, and this is the rolled rose. And the way this was done is in a long strip. They've made the petal shapes and then rolled it up and sewn it in the back. The way you make your petals in a flower is simply by going from shortest stitch, which again is that single crochet stitch, then a half double, then a double, then back down to a half double, and then a single. So you're going from shortest to second highest to third highest, back to second highest, and then to first highest stitch. So simply by changing stitches, it changes the height of that row, and so you get a very fluid petal shape. In the center, you can also add more than one double crochet to make a wider petal for that tallest point. And of the course the pattern will tell you how many stitches they want you to make that petal out of. \n\nThe second type of construction is done flat like this, it's not rolled. And it's done in one piece in rounds. So you can check out that Crocheting the Round video if you haven't already. You're going to choose a beginning, and then you're going to work rounds in your petal shapes. So over the first few stitches, you use that same technique of starting with the shortest stitch, the single crochet, moving up to the double, back down to the single, in whatever sort of amount or width you want. And that's how you get those petal shapes. It's the same way as in the rolled rose here. And this pattern is the Irish Rose. Both of these flower patterns are available on our Stitch Finder that's found under the Learning Center on LionBrand.com. It's a great resource to go to, to find many, many more of these crochet flower patterns as well. And they're all free. So it's a great way to just practice how to make a lot of these patterns, and put a lot more techniques into one very small, very fast project. \n\nSome ways that you can use flowers in a piece, besides have a lovely bouquet that never dies, is putting them on something, or making a crocheted chain and putting flowers in between the chains to make fun things like this posie belt here. This scarf also uses those Irish Rose flowers, and they're just sewn on to a basic crocheted scarf. So it's a great way to add a little bit of whimsy to a project. And this other one as well is similar to the Irish Rose flower, but it's a little bit flatter. And this is the Garden Scarf. \n\nSo all of these projects, the Garden Scarf, the posy belt, the flowered scarf, the Irish Rose, and the rolled rose are all available for free on LionBrand.com, so go and check it out.", "title": "How to Crochet a Flower | Crocheting", "publishedDate": "2011-07-21T15:10:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JVzSlkNoCI", "description": "Video of the song \"Postcards From Hell\"\nB-Side of a Jigsaw's album  \"Drunken Sailors & Happy Pirates\"\nhttp://www.ajigsaw.net\nVideo Directed by Maria In\u00eas Afonso.\nMusic Recorded, Mixed and Mastered by a Jigsaw at the Blue House.\nLyrics: http://ajigsaw.blogspot.pt/2014/02/postcards-from-hell.html\nhttp://www.ajigsaw.net", "title": "a Jigsaw - Postcards From Hell [Official Video]", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T19:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JWrQr2kDDA", "description": "Here my last video upload from my sicilian tour, with a very suitable title..\n\nernst stolz", "title": "farewell unkind by John Dowland - instrumental version", "publishedDate": "2011-07-22T15:12:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JWtozz1zgM", "description": "Ibuprofen is used as a pain reliever, and it has many side effects.

After hitting an all-time low, giving a lecture to elementary school kids, Dr. Marshall meets an ambitious young scientist named Holly (Anna Friel), who tells him she has followed all his work and believes he's a genius. Spurred on by her enthusiasm, he finishes building the device that will allow him to time travel -- something he promptly does along with Holly, and white-trash fireworks salesman Will (Danny McBride), after Will leads them into a cave that seems like a promising place to test the new machine. They end up in a world full of dinosaurs, sand, and scary lizard-like creatures known as Sleestacks. They quickly lose the machine that brought them to this alternate universe, and if they ever want to return home, the trio must recover it with the help of Chaka (Jorma Taccone), the monkey-like friend they make in this strange place.\n\n\"land of the lost\",\"land of the lost clip\",\"land of the lost trailer\",\"land of the lost part 1\",\"will ferrell\",\"danny mcbride\",\"jorma taccone\",\"anna friel\",\"knife videos\",\"lighter videos\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",comedy,fantasy,\"sci-fi adventure\",\"ryan kavanaugh\",\"daniel lupi\",\"joshua church\",\"michele panelli-venetis\",\"julie wixson darmody\",\"brad silberling\",\"marty krofft\",\"sid krofft\",\"will weiske\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++420657,/m/018grr,/m/02wycg2,/m/091yn0,/m/01pd1k", "title": "Land of the Lost (2/10) Movie CLIP - Chaka (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:48:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JZS5upmhec", "description": "Artist: INDUS CREED\nSong Title: Can You Take It Harder\nAlbum: Evolve\n\nVisual Artist: Monk Drunkeys\n\nAbsolut Vh1 Liquid TV: A unique interpretation of your favorite music tracks, blended with accompanying visuals to enhance your Musical Experience!

Uday Benegal (vocals), Mahesh Tinaikar (guitar), Mark Selwyn (bass), Jayesh Gandhi (guitar), Zubin Balaporia (keyboards) and Mark Menezes (drums) first came together in 1985. Then called Rock Machine, the guys had no mission or plan. Just an unflagging desire to play the music they loved. In the face of all reason (there was just one government-run TV channel and radio station, neither of which thought rock'n'roll to be particularly \"cultural\") the band set out to do just that. It took blood, guts and a steely resolve to cut through the crap. It was just a matter of time before practically every college and concert promoter in the country wanted to book what had become India's favourite band. The rest is history. They recorded three albums, won a bunch of awards and changed their name to Indus Creed. And in the process they inspired an entire generation to pick up an instrument and rock it out. Here's a quick roundup of some of their multifarious achievements:\n\u2022 Toured the length and breadth of India\u2028\u2022 Repped the country at the Festival of India in the USSR\u2028\u2022 Played at Peter Gabriel's WOMAD festival in the UK\u2028\u2022 Performed with Bon Jovi to over 40,000 people in Bombay\u2028\u2022 Performed on stage with GN'R guitar player Slash for MTV's launch in Bangalore\u2028\u2022 Toured the UK and the Middle East extensivel", "title": "INDUS CREED - Can You Take It Harder", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T09:08:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0J_74k8W_bU", "description": "\u00c9 isso bjs", "title": "Como fazer  :cheddar cremoso do McDonald", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T00:03:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0J_9L_JbFyY", "description": "Produziert von ReiGro TV f\u00fcr die Sendung \"Wenn die Musi kommt\"\n\ncopyright by ReiGro TV", "title": "Relax - Ois w\u00e4r\u00b4 Weihnacht\u00b4n an jed\u00b4m dog", "publishedDate": "2011-12-05T23:40:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0J_BL6-j5bg", "description": "Melanoma animation which shows how melanoma grows and has the potential to spread within the body.

A trauma is simply a form of sensory-emotional overload that the brain is unable to process and assimilate. The intense memory imprint and associated emotions become \"stuck\", literally frozen in time, creating flash-backs and endlessly recurring intrusive thoughts and emotional reactions.\n\nThere are many sources of PTSD. Experience of war is well documented, but trauma is also an occupational hazard for emergency responders, fire officers, police officers and medical response personnel. Medical Doctors can also experience PTSD as they try to cope with the trauma of dispensing a terminal diagnosis to a patient.\n\nOne unrecognized source of PTSD is from the very process of giving birth itself. Again, the intense sensory overload accompanied by very intense emotions can create a traumatic image that does not resolve by itself.\n\nThe other biggest source of PTSD results from childhood trauma, at the hands of abusive parents or relatives or from bullying. The child, by its very nature, is least able to process intense sensory/emotional experiences, and these can become suppressed as unresolved core emotions that arise much later, during adult life as anxiety, panic attacks, uncontrollable anger and depression.\n\nWhatever the cause of PTSD, these unresolved core emotions need resolution and this is the whole focus of Mindfulness Therapy which I provide via Skype. This is often a good choice for people who might not feel comfortable sharing their experiences in front of a group or even to a therapist in-person.\n\nOnline Therapy for PTSD - Talk to a Therapist Online for Help with POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)\n\nVideo URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JoXEEZCOGE\n\nThe Boulder Center for Mindfulness Therapy Online with Dr. Peter Strong.\nSkype-Based Online Psychotherapy for Anxiety & Depression, Traumatic Stress and PTSD, Addictions, Emotional Abuse Recovery and other Emotional Problems: A convenient and effective Online Counseling Service that you can access from home.\n\nCONTACT ME TODAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT STARTING ONLINE THERAPY WITH AN ONLINE THERAPIST FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\n\nVisit my website http://www.counselingtherapyonline.com to learn more about this Online Therapy Service.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SkypeTherapist\nG+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113242558209153665007/+Counselingtherapyonline/posts\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/skypetherapist/boards/\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT ONLINE THERAPY WITH AN ONLINE THERAPIST\nYou might also like to watch this introductory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Az1VwZ1AQ\nGo to My Youtube Channel to Watch More Videos about Online Mindfulness Therapy: https://www.youtube.com/user/pdmstrong/videos.\n\nTo learn more about the treatment of Emotional Trauma see (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/coping-with-traumatic-events/index.shtml.\n\nTo learn more about the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) see http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml.", "title": "Online Therapy for PTSD - Online Therapist for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T17:34:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Jon2JHN-nQ", "description": "NBC\\n\\n Visit this place at http://www.roblox.com/Lucca-Cafe-Lite-place?id=17825084\\n\\nFor more games visit http://www.roblox.com", "title": "MY grammar and activeness seem to be a 4-5 in Luca/Alive opinion.", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T23:06:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Joz_2tgHg0", "description": "La nueva serie de Borja P\u00e9rez y Rub\u00e9n Ontiveros para www.vadejuegos.com\nhttps://twitter.com/Borjavdj", "title": "VIDEOTUTORIAL 1X33 - GOW ASCENSION / SCREENER-", "publishedDate": "2013-05-14T09:06:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Jp5VeT0GUI", "description": "Live Rhythm & Blues gig at Blackpool's Pump & Truncheon pub!", "title": "Malady & Medicine - Hound Dog - Live at The Pump & Truncheon", "publishedDate": "2014-04-16T10:14:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JpSmDHYGys", "description": "All-new Mazda MX-5 is the sixth in Mazda's new generation of products that adopt both the KODO--Soul of Motion design theme and the full-suite of SKYACTIV Technologies. / \u65b0\u578b\u300c\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u306f\u3001\u300cSKYACTIV\u6280\u8853\u300d\u3068\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u300c\u9b42\u52d5\uff08\u3053\u3069\u3046\uff09\u2212Soul of Motion\u300d\u3092\u5168\u9762\u7684\u306b\u63a1\u7528\u3057\u305f\u65b0\u4e16\u4ee3\u5546\u54c1\u306e\u7b2c\u516d\u5f3e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "title": "All-new Mazda MX-5 Launch Film / \u65b0\u578b\u300c\u30de\u30c4\u30c0 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u30c1\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T04:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JpYlJWQpgM", "description": "\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0456\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0456\u0437\u043c / Ukrainian primitiveness", "title": "\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e/Maria Prymachenko", "publishedDate": "2010-11-05T08:49:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JpYpMfZA70", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000306514936&fref=ts\n\nEN GIER MUSIC!", "title": "DRUNX FOX- cover de pantera - 5 MINUTES ALONE", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T03:13:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0Jprdto0jdo", "description": "Recently in southern Taiwan, a 30 year old man took his frustrations out on his pet cat by force feeding it two metal screws.\n\nThree months ago the young man had adopted a kitten from a friend.

The imperative role of this branch of government is thoroughly researched in this informative production.\n\nThe Supreme Courts responsibility is to interpret all laws and ensure that they do not conflict with the founding principles of the Constitution.

You mentioned that your youngest child is about three years old, you've had a few C-sections and you're having issues with either diastasis recti or a hernia and you've been to the doctor and been told that you have both.  You're wondering what you can do about it and what you may truly have.  A hernia can be a result of having a baby and so can diastasis recti.  There are lots of different kinds of hernias and they can be caused by having a baby, or by having surgery such as a C-section, or just occur spontaneously.  There are many different types and each different type is caused by something different and is handled differently.  As far as diastasis rectus goes, it happens when the muscle fibers they kind of split during pregnancy as your uterus grows.  It's more typical in women who carried twins to full term or had an abnormally large baby or just maybe carried your baby out really far.  But the muscle fibers failed to kind of go back together so there is a gap there.  You mentioned it's causing you lots of pain and you feel like you look like you're eight months pregnant.  So definitely it sounds like you need to get some help.  But you need a diagnosis to be made.  I recommend going to the doctor again and being very candid about your concerns and asking them to make a diagnosis and based on that give you the best treatment options because the treatment options really vary according to the diagnosis given.  So diastasis recti is handled differently than a hernia would be handled.  In both cases though the complications can be reduced by weight loss and by exercise, especially with diastasis recti.  It helps if you perform abdominal exercises that help strengthen the abdominals and put them back together.  In the meantime until you're able to talk to a doctor, perform some exercises that are going to help strengthen your core, your abdominals, your lower back.  And do what you can to help lose weight if you have weight to lose.  Good luck.  I hope you find the help you need from a doctor but if you have any other questions for me feel free to ask them on our Facebook page and recommend us to your friends and family too.", "title": "How do I know if I have a hernia or diastasis recti?", "publishedDate": "2013-01-10T21:52:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0JyA5Yeta_I", "description": "[ Full info and comments @ http://www.RoboCNC.nl/?p=3286 ]\n[RoboCNC Frees & Graveerwerk http://www.RoboCNC.nl/]\n\nYou have seen us engrave Acrylic before...\nYou have seen us use edge LED lighting before...\nYou have seen us use laminated plastics before...\nThis short video shows you how we combine them.\n\nU heeft ons al zien graveren in Acrylaat...\nU heeft ons al gebruik zien maken van LED verlichting...\nU heeft ons al zien graveren in gelamineerde plastic soorten....\nIn deze korte video ziet U hoe wij deze elementen combineren.\n\nThanks to...

Some analyses indicate that the Somali Ostrich may be better considered a full species apart from the Common Ostrich, but most taxonomists consider it to be a subspecies.\nOstriches share the order Struthioniformes with the kiwis, emus, and other ratites. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at maximum speeds of about 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph)[3], the top land speed of any bird.[4][5] The Ostrich is the largest living species of bird and lays the largest egg of any living bird (extinct elephant birds of Madagascar and the giant moa of New Zealand did lay larger eggs).\nThe diet of Ostriches mainly consists of plant matter, though it also eats invertebrates. It lives in nomadic groups which contain between five and fifty birds. When threatened, the Ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground, or will run away. If cornered, it can attack with a kick from its powerful legs. Mating patterns differ by geographical region, but territorial males fight for a harem of two to seven females. These fights usually last just minutes, but they can easily cause death through slamming their heads into opponents.\nThe Ostrich is farmed around the world, particularly for its feathers, which are decorative and are also used as feather dusters. Its skin is used for leather products and its meat marketed commercially.\n\nOstriches usually weigh from 63 to 130 kilograms (140--290 lb),[8][9] with exceptional male Ostriches weighing up to 156.8 kilograms (346 lb).[9] The feathers of adult males are mostly black, with white primaries and a white tail. However, the tail of one subspecies is buff. Females and young males are greyish-brown and white. The head and neck of both male and female Ostriches is nearly bare, with a thin layer of down.[8][10] The skin of the females neck and thighs is pinkish gray,[10] while the male's is blue-gray, gray or pink dependent on subspecies.\nThe long neck and legs keep their head 1.8 to 2.75 metres (6 to 9 ft) above the ground, and their eyes are said to be the largest of any land vertebrate -- 50 millimetres (2.0 in) in diameter;[11] they can therefore perceive predators at a great distance. The eyes are shaded from sun light falling from above.[12][13]\nTheir skin varies in colour depending on the sub-species. The strong legs of the Ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the tarsus (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales -- red in the male, black in the female.[9] The bird has just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with the nail on the larger, inner toe resembling a hoof. The outer toe has no nail.[14] The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running. Ostriches can run at over 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) for up to 30 minutes.[citation needed] The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (7 ft)[15] and are used in mating displays and to shade chicks. The feathers lack the tiny hooks that lock together the smooth external feathers of flying birds, and so are soft and fluffy and serve as insulation. They have 50-60 tail feathers, and their wings have 16 primary, four alular and 20-23 secondary feathers.[9] The Ostrich's sternum is flat, lacking the keel to which wing muscles attach in flying birds.[16] The beak is flat and broad, with a rounded tip.[8] Like all ratites, the Ostrich has no crop,[17] and it also lacks a gallbladder.[18] They have three stomachs, and the caecum is 71 centimetres (28 in) long. Unlike all other living birds, the Ostrich secretes urine separately from faeces.[19] Contrary to all other birds who store the urine and faeces combined in the coprodeum, they store the faeces in the terminal rectum.[19] They also have unique pubic bones that are fused to hold their gut. Unlike most birds the males have a copulatory organ, which is retractable and 8 inches (20 cm) long. Their palate differs from other ratites in that the sphenoid and palatal bones are unconnected.", "title": "Cooking an Ostrich Egg", "publishedDate": "2009-12-25T05:51:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0K7ppDLkkAs", "description": "", "title": "Kushi Ka 2nd B Day", "publishedDate": "2009-10-15T13:28:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "0K8OWfvZtA4", "description": "Stephen Hawking is near-universally recognized as a brilliant scientist, and one small facet of his complex genius is the rockstar ability to democratize scientific knowledge. It's becoming increasingly important as purveyors of pop culture continue to eschew acknowledgment and respect for the most basic scientific principles. Hollywood in particular has continued its marginalization of scientific knowledge with blatant disregard in recent films.\n\nBut Hawking acts like a great counter force against anti-intellectual movements. He takes complex scientific principles and explains them so the general public can understand and, more importantly, appreciate the science behind them. He inspires people to want to know more about Calabi--Yau manifolds and multiverses. That is why Stephen Hawking rocks our scientific world.\n\nSo I (and everyone around me) felt a consummate air of curiosity in the Paramount Theater lobby on June 16, as Dr. Hawking arrived for an appearance at the Seattle Science Festival. But what was everyone curious about? Was it Dr. Hawking's motor neuron disease? Or how his speech synthesizer works, perhaps?\n\nThe following are the press questions from Seattle-area colleagues that I read to Dr. Hawking at a press event before his main program. The 70-year-old scientist keynoted a Saturday night symposium that also featured Leroy Hood and Jack Horner, with Hawking discussing his life and Nobel aspirations among other topics.", "title": "Charlie Dickens - Havarti Pits ft.

Shelled molluscs therefore predate the earliest trilobites. Although most helcionellid fossils are only a few millimeters long, specimens a few centimeters long have also been found, most with more limpet-like shapes. There have been suggestions that the tiny specimens were juveniles and the larger ones adults.\n\nMore Science Fiction:\nThe fungi probably colonized the land during the Cambrian (542--488.3 Ma), long before land plants. Fossilized hyphae and spores recovered from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (460 Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed at a time when the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants. Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416--359.2 Ma), when they are abundant in the Rhynie chert, mostly as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. At about this same time, approximately 400 Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged, and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1--299 Ma).\n\nReal Science:\nMycology is the branch of biology concerned with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans as a source of medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.\n\n1 Corinthians 6:20 \"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" \n\nSome creatures seem more wise and powerful in dealing with the problems of living than seems reasonable.\n    \nFor example, when threatened with parasites, some creatures change their method of reproduction to put the parasites at a disadvantage. Several types of fungus infect some grasses, producing poisons. However, these poisons don't harm the infected grass. Instead, they protect the grass from insects and other enemies. This makes it less likely that the fungus will lose its happy home.\n\nWhen fungal parasites take over certain wild grasses, the fungus destroys the flowers of the plant so that it can only reproduce by sending out shoots from its roots. Can you figure out the fungus's clever strategy? New shoots are genetically identical to the parent, and just as susceptible to the fungus. New plants from seeds, however, might express traits that were present, though unexpressed, in the parent, like resistance to the fungus. So it's in the fungus's best interest to restrict the grass to identical offspring.\n\nA New Zealand freshwater snail can reproduce with or without fertilized eggs. However, in those lakes where the snail is threatened by a parasitic worm, the snail uses only fertilized eggs, increasing the likelihood that some of the offspring will be able to resist the parasite.\n\nThere is a lot more thought and power to be seen in these examples than worms, snails and grasses could generate. The Creator is even glorified in the relationships between parasite and host!\n\nPrayer: \nDear Father in heaven, there is nothing in the creation that does not glorify You! I thank You for that and pray that I might do a better job of glorifying You before others. In Jesus' Name. Amen. \n\nNotes: \nCowen, Ron. 1990. \"Parasite power.\" Science News,", "title": "Creative Strategies for Life vs The Evolution of Death", "publishedDate": "2011-04-25T11:07:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "0K9iRKm-nEY", "description": "", "title": "Lem's death the shield", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T11:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0KAEd8noXi4", "description": "Imaret Hotel Kavala Hotel Website: http://emalaysiatravel.net/en/europe/greece/kavala/imaret_hotel.html?CID=1460346  Imaret Hotel is a popular choice amongst travelers in Kavala, whether exploring or just passing through.

In this zoo the tigers are kept in a  large area. This video only captures part of that area. The tigers are well fed too, they are not skinny. The average weight of a Siberian Tiger, like this one, should be around 170 kilograms for a male, and 117 kilograms for the female. The reason for them fighting probably was the fact that the female tiger just had cubs (tiger babies), and she wants to keep them safe, therefore she doesn't want the male tiger to come into her territory. In tigers, it is very common that the male tiger kills and eats his own cubs. Therefore, this sort of behaviour in tigers is completely normal.
