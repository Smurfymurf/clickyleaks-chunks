Different coaches will say different things, but I'm sure the best ones out there all mean the same thing. Meaning they're looking to give the athlete the verbal cue that will make them move properly. I believe it's both. The shrug happens at the end of the second pull and initiates the third pull. \n\nA lot of folks Clean or Snatch without shrugging very much. If you don't and you start it can be a game changer. \n\nFor both the clean and snatch the shrug will affect the bar path and your movement around the bar. Lack of the shrug can cause the bar to get away from you causing you to have to move forward for the reception. Shrugging will help you finish your pull and get that last 10% you need to move more efficiently.\n\nFor the Snatch the shrug shouldn't really end until the lift is completed. Lack of a shrug during the snatch will usually cause your shoulders to not be as active as they should be making the reception of the weight more difficult. If you shrug and keep the top of your scapula squeezed together (showing your armpits) for the reception you'll notice that the received weight will feel much lighter and your overhead squat position will be more comfortable.\n\nSpotting the lack of shrug:\nYou move forward to receive the bar\nShoulders are unstable during the reception of the bar during the snatch\nYou have tiny traps\n\nDrills to help you shrug:\nTall clean and snatches (no hips). Make sure to initiate the movement with a shrug.\nClean and Snatch pulls\n\nSame advice as last post. Put them in your warmups daily if this is a problem for you. Start with PVC, move to the bar and then do some weight. You should be able to tall snatch about 50% of your snatch. If you can't then there's a problem. You should be able to tall clean about 75% of your clean. Even if you can go heavier keep it light so you can drill daily.\n\nGet to work add it to your program,\nMike\n\nFor more CrossFit techniques visit http://www.TechniqueWOD.com", "title": "How to Shrug Under the Bar: Improve Your Snatch for CrossFit workouts - TechniqueWOD", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T00:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sLNsEDa38k", "description": "Video from the Why We Give apportionment series", "title": "Why We Give: Mary Kay Totty", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T18:21:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sLTPoKCEhI", "description": "Finitura decorativa murale eco-compatibile a base di puro Grassello di Calce stagionato a grana media con polveri di marmo di Carrara.\nEco-friendly, medium-grain decorative wall finish obtained from selected Carrara marble aggregates and genuine Slaked-Lime.", "title": "Carrara", "publishedDate": "2012-08-02T22:41:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sLWUAvg2fo", "description": "Over a hundred years old german steamship Freya sails to the port of Szczecin / Stettin Poland.

I specialise in female alternative health, and the endocrine system, which governs the production of hormones, affecting fertility, weight, and other conditions that affect women such as uterine fibroids. \nstop fibroids  I have worked with hundreds of clients with menstrual issues such as fibroids, and have discovered a startling fact: \n\nFACT: Most women diagnosed with fibroids are being offered medical treatments that merely mask their symptoms... only a handful of alternative healthcare professionals have a clue about how to treat the root cause of fibroids (and you'll be lucky if you ever find them.) \nWhat's more, even if you could find a professional who knew anything about treating fibroids it would cost you hundreds of dollars in visits and take MONTHS of tinkering with expensive herbal treatments just to restore the quality of your life \n\n \nThis is why I had to write about this subject... to address the huge lack of knowlege out there about shrinking fibroids without drugs, surgery or side effects. \nstop fibroids  My new book teaches you which natural remedies are most powerful against fibroids, and how to use herbal remedies to tackle the root cause of uterine fibroids. \nIt's a simple 7 step action plan designed to help anyone with fibroids to relieve their symptoms fast, and regain their quality of life. \n\nstop fibroids  The action plan is 7 steps to becoming free of fibroids. I have distilled the very best of the treatments I use with women of all ages into this life-changing plan. \nIn the action plan, I explain in full detail each of the steps, which if carried out on a regular basis, will restore your body and menstrual cycle to \"normal\". \nThe 7 steps in the stop fibroids action plan are valuable for anyone who has decided to take control of their health and their body. Each one of us makes that choice depending on our individual time clock. For some, it's early in young adulthood, when they first get their diagnosis; and for others, they will have tried a range of treatments that have failed them, such as Androgens (male hormones) like danazol, and GnRH agonists like Lupron or Synarel... or even more invasive procedures like myomectomies, embolizations or ablations. \n\nThe remedies apply whether you've just been diagnosed, have had fibroids for 30-40 years, or are anywhere in between. \n\nStop fibroids http://stopfibroids.at.vu These 7 steps will allow you to learn more about your body and how it works.

MARK MATTHEWS SAYING:\n\"Well I think that the stimulus package that was announced over the weekend had already been disclosed to the market before. So it's a validation of something that we know. But I think the important thing is that the government has executed so far on 100% of everything that it said it would do, which is a good thing. And I think also that more importantly, if you read an article in the Nikkei last week, an interview with Abe, he was making what I thought were incredibly forceful statements about how this is not a period where Japan can afford to be complacent anymore. It's lost too much of its competitive edge due to the weak yen. And he said that's just got to change. Sorry, the strong yen. So I think the yen will continue to weaken, yes.\"\n3. REPORTER OFF CAMERA SAYING:\n\"Are his bold words just a short-term move or is he really perceived as a bold new leader?\"\n4.  MARK MATTHEWS SAYING:\n\"Well of course there's a wall of skepticism around this because since Koizumi, on average, prime ministers in Japan have lasted about a year. But I was interested to see that Abe has reactivated a council of economic ministers, advisors excuse me, which dates back from Koizumi actually. And that council was really critical to the creation and enforcement of a lot of the reform programs during the Koizumi era that caused that brief period of time in the sun, if you will, for Japan. So I think that bringing back this entity of people from both the public and the private sector and making it a very, very big part of policy creation and implementation is an important move. And I think also obviously within in the BOJ we're seeing a reaction as well, now targeting 2% which they vociferously opposed before. So I think it's very justified to say that things are changing in Japan.\"\n5. REPORTER OFF CAMERA SAYING:\n\"So do you think the yen is going to hit new lows?\"\n6.  MARK MATTHEWS SAYING:\n\"Yes, we do, but I really can't tell you a number. I do think that the skeptics are right that an economy this moribund where people have become so used to low growth and disinflation is hard to turn around. And the demographics are not on their side either. So I think that right now there's still a positive wind that will cause the yen to weaken. But if we don't eventually see this show up in numbers a few months down the road, then I think the skeptics will start to get the upper hand again. And that just remains to be seen.\"", "title": "Shinzo Abe's bold announcement of a stimulus package will cause the yen to weaken for now, but sk...", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T10:06:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sTPD1ZcR1w", "description": "De stem van Rechercheur De Cock, opgenomen uit afleveringen van de Baantjer-krimiserie, in telefoongesprek met de buurvrouw van mevrouw Bloem.", "title": "Rechercheur De Cock - Klacht over mevrouw Bloem", "publishedDate": "2008-01-26T05:59:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sTaIp_dfFU", "description": "Hoya Trivex Lens Comparisons", "title": "Hoya Trivex Lens Comparisons", "publishedDate": "2010-05-20T02:54:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sUME924BU0", "description": "This video is about Untitled Project", "title": "Mashie", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T13:46:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sUQ6c4ajqE", "description": "In this screencast, Andrew Burrows walks you through the factors involved in the solubility of Group 1 salts. http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199691852.do#.UT8pidY4vTq", "title": "The solubility of Group 1 salts", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T20:21:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sUaMOthIsU", "description": "Our staghound running down county road.

The girl agreed and asked for a very small price. The man asked her name since he liked her very much. The girl refused to tell her name and answered that the cossack would hear it right from under his horse's shoes when he rides it. The cossack started riding his horse and guessing her name - Masha? Zina? Dasha? Nina?.. No, they were all wrong... KATYA, KATYA, KATERINA - the horseshoes knocked her name...!!!

Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a \"mob\", \"gang\" or \"clan\". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12--14 years, and about half this in the wild\n\n\"Meerkat\" is a loanword from Afrikaans. The name has a Dutch origin, but by misidentification. Dutch meerkat refers to the \"guenon\", a monkey of the Cercopithecus genus. The word \"meerkat\" is Dutch for \"lake cat\", but the suricata is not in the cat family, and neither suricatas nor guenons are attracted to lakes; the word possibly started as a Dutch adaptation of a derivative of Sanskrit marka\u0163a \u092e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u091f = \"monkey\", perhaps in Africa via an Indian sailor on board a Dutch East India Company ship. The traders of the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with monkeys, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. The suricata is called stokstaartje = \"little stick-tail\" in Dutch.\n \nAccording to African popular belief (mainly in the Zambian/Zimbabwean region), the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone tribesmen", "title": "Meerkat\u3000Miercat \u30de\u30f3\u30b0\u30fc\u30b9\u79d1\u30df\u30fc\u30a2\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30c857s", "publishedDate": "2013-04-02T05:52:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sdRDUIZw8A", "description": "Dragon Age: Inquisition will be available to EA Access members starting November 13 -- five days before the game's official release date.\n\nRead more here:\nhttp://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/dragon-age-inquisition-ea-access-trial-starts-november-13\n\nSubscribe to IGN News Channel here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IGNNews?sub_confirmation=1", "title": "Dragon Age: Inquisition EA Access Trial Starts November 13 - IGN News", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T02:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3se3HNiBO-Q", "description": "This video is ment to help those of you who are having problems extracting mob blood/glue/etc.  Really It's my attempt to help out SeroGrave.  :)  Hope it helps!", "title": "Melting Down Mobs - Tinkers Construct", "publishedDate": "2014-02-09T01:05:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3seZPI5_UX0", "description": "Een van de 20 exemplaren die deze dag langsvlogen.", "title": "Noordse Pijlstormvogel, Westkapelle, 16 september 2010", "publishedDate": "2012-07-10T13:43:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3seaMWroym4", "description": "From the EP \"Kaleidoscope Eyes\" by Mason's Hands, 2013.\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/masonshands\nSpotify: https://play.spotify.com/artist/3pvomQfedvOr6jSYD8wtOy\nHOME: http://www.masonshands.com/\n\nItunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kaleidoscope-eyes-ep/id733632289\nhttps://soundcloud.com/masonshands\n\nComposed by: Koutu & JP Pulkkinen,\nLyrics by.

Now it\u2019s getting an HD remastered version for Xbox One, so how does a 12 year old horror game stack up against its current gen peers? Surprisingly well, it turns out as you'll see in this 1080p gameplay.\n\nAdmittedly, the reason it looks so good is partly to do with how dark everything is and how the backgrounds are pre-rendered. Both are flattering to the game\u2019s upscaled graphics, but also help add to the creeping sense of dread that permeates the game\u2019s spooky mansion setting.\n\nResident Evil HD Remastered is due out as a download in early 2015.\n\n---\n\nOutside Xbox brings you daily videos about Xbox 360 games and Xbox One games.

Some authorities believe that peleides is a subspecies of Morpho helenor. The brilliant blue color in the butterfly's wings is caused by the diffraction of the light from millions of tiny scales on its wings. It uses this to frighten away predators, by flashing its wings rapidly. The wingspan of the Blue Morpho butterfly ranges from 7.5--20 cm (3.0--7.9 in). The entire Blue Morpho butterfly lifecycle, from egg to adult is only 115 days. Known larval foodplants are Leguminosae (Arachis hypogaea, Dioclea wilsonii, Inga spp., Lonchocarpus, Machaerium cobanense, Machaerium salvadorense, Machaerium seemannii, Medicago sativa, Mucuna mutisiana, Pithecellobium, Pterocarpus rohrii, Mucuna urens), and Bignoniaceae (Paragonia pyramidata). Morpho peleides drinks the juices from rotting fruits for food. Its favourites in captivity are mango, kiwi, and lychee. Morpho peleides butterflies live in the rainforests of South America, and can be found in Mexico and Central America. The larvae of Morpho peleides butterflies are occasional cannibals. These caterpillars are red-brown with patches of bright green. Morpho peleides butterflies stick together in groups to deter their predators, a form of mobbing behavior. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpho_peleides \n\nButterflies in the Glasshouse has become a delightful annual fixture on Wisley's calendar. Brighten up a winter's day by stepping into a world of tropical colour- here's a taste of this very special event. : http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardens/Wisley/What-s-on/Butterflies-at-Wisley \n\nFlowers for butterflies - It's important to choose plants with open, single blooms so that the butterflies can reach the nectar. Double blooms - as found in many cultivated roses, primroses and so on - are no good for butterflies or bees so we try to avoid them. We have many butterfly-friendly wildflowers, including...

I resti di un mammut vissuto decine di migliaia di anni fa, conservati in buono stato dal gelo siberiano, sono stati ritrovati a fine settembre da un ragazzino di 11 anni.\n\nGli studiosi ci sanno gi\u00e0 dire molto su questo animale, un esemplare giovane che probabilmente vagava nella tundra in cerca di cibo o seguendo le tracce di una femmina e fu ucciso da un uomo preistorico in una giornata d'estate.\n\n\"Per recuperarlo - racconta il coordinatore delle operazioni Sergei Gorbunov - abbiamo dovuto usare sia strumenti tradizionali, come asce, picconi, pale, sia dispositivi come un \"vaporizzatore\" che ci ha permesso di scongelare un sottile strato di permafrost, poi lo abbiamo ripulito, e poi ne abbiamo sciolto un altro strato. Ci abbiamo messo una settimana per completare il lavoro.\"\n\nI resti sono particolarmente interessanti perch\u00e9 oltre alle ossa, che vengono ritrovate spesso nella zona, comprendono anche parti di tessuti, pelle e organi interni, che consentiranno di studiare meglio questi animali.\n\n\"Questi tipi di mammut - spiega Alexei Tikhonov, vice-direttore dell'Istituto Zoologico dell'Accademia delle Scienze russa - sono raffigurati in pitture paleolitiche. Ci si chiedeva perch\u00e9 fossero rappresentati con la gobba, e si pensava che fosse perch\u00e9 avevano vertebre toraciche sporgenti. Ma ora vediamo che non \u00e8 cos\u00ec, che questo animale si era ben adattato alle condizioni climatiche del nord, e accumulava grandi riserve di grasso per l'inverno. Questo animale molto probabilmente \u00e8 morto in estate perch\u00e9 non vediamo un sottopelo, ma aveva gi\u00e0 riserve di grasso abbastanza significative e credo che le stesse accumulando in vista dell'inverno.\"\n\nL'esemplare ritrovato aveva 16 anni, era alto 2 metri e pesava 500 chilogrammi. Lo hanno chiamato Jenya, come il suo giovanissimo scopritore.\n\nSi seguono:\nSu Youtube http://bit.ly/wV2enX\nSu Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/euronewsit", "title": "euronews science - Un mammut ben conservato scoperto da un bambino", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T15:05:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3sjR3gGpacU", "description": "VERY GOOD SOUND!!!

Several veronica species and cultivars are cultivated for use as groundcovers. The resilient speedwell species have a fine, fibrous root system and bright green roundish, oval, or heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges. The leaves are often small, with some under 1/4 inch long, the flowers are typically also small and are blue or bluish-white in color. In all the plant species but one, the leaves are alternate near the end of flowering stems, but the leaves are opposite near the base. Species of Veronica are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, including the Grizzled Skipper. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_(plant)\n\nVeronica arvensis (corn speedwell, common speedwell, speedwell, rock speedwell, wall speedwell   is a medicinal plant  and noxious weed native to Africa, Asia and Europe. A member of the plantain family, it is a hairy, erect to almost recumbent, annual herb, 9 to 40 cm high from a taproot. The leaves are oppositely arranged in pairs about the stem. The lower leaves have short petioles; the upper are sessile. Each leaf, 1.5 to 2.5 centimeters in length, is ovate, or triangular with a truncated or slightly cordate base, with coarse teeth. Borne in a raceme, initially compact but elongating with age, the flowers are pale blue to blue-violet, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, four-lobed with a narrow lowest lobe. Flower stalks are 0.5 to 2 mm and shorter than the bracts.  See more: \n\nVeronica chamaedrys V\u00f6ludepla - Bl\u00e1 bl\u00f3m \u00ed j\u00fal\u00ed. \u00deolir skugga. Har\u00f0ger\u00f0.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "new 2015 1 080 hp Applaus   Idiada Volar  E 2015", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:06:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t-ICrxXuBY", "description": "Swimming pool overflows during Cebu quake Video Credits via Marlon Santos, Villa Teresita Resort\nActual Scary CCTV Footage of Villa Teresita during Earthquake (Bohol & Cebu City Lindol 10.15.2013)\nVIDEO: Earthquake affects swimming pool in a local resort at Talisay City,Cebu, causing the water to form waves and overflow due to the intensity of the tremors.\n\nAccording to resort owner Marlon Santos, resort guests were evacuated shortly after and the resort remained closed yesterday, Oct. 15 2013, due to the incident.

Concern was raised following the latest Snowden revelations and prompted the German FM to invite the British ambassador 'for a talk'.\nThe news comes just one week after the alleged closure of an American listening 'nest' just 150 meters away from the British embassy, which is believed to be damage control following the embarrassing details of how the US itself is listening in on Merkel. \nNSA documents leaked by Snowden, and supported by satellite photographs and related information about past spying activities, talk of high-tech listening equipment perched right on top of the British embassy, the Independent revealed in an exclusive.\u00a0\nThe allegations prompted the German Foreign Ministry to call on British Ambassador Simon McDonald to discuss Tuesday's reports. \"At the instigation of Foreign Minister (Guido) Westerwelle, the British ambassador was asked to come for a talk at the Foreign Ministry,\" the Ministry said in a statement. \n\nThe roof of the British embassy appears to contain a white, box-like structure that only shows up when photographed from above. The suspected listening device has been mounted atop the roof since the embassy's opening in 2000. Germany's centers of political power are all built around the Brandenburg Gate, within easy reach of the facility's equipment.\nThe strength of the equipment has been assessed as such that it can intercept mobile phone conversations, Wi-Fi traffic, and even long-distance calls made from anywhere in Berlin. \nThe reason for the suspicions has to do with the striking resemblance of the device to Cold-War-era toys used by the British in West Berlin. There, housed in the now defunct Teufelsberg (Devil's Mountain), the GCHQ used to intercept messages between Russia and East Germany. \nAll this is happening in the midst of a spy scandal involving America's own spying on classified German communications. \nBut unlike the American case, the Germans appeared to have missed the connection with a similar-looking unit perched atop the roof of the British embassy, the Independent believes -- despite there being reason to think the suspected British listening post could even have been linked to a similar NSA device that became the centerpiece of the US-related scandal.\u00a0\nEvidence of the United States' own secret listening post has embarrassingly popped up in infrared images taken by Germany's ARD television, showing an anonymous rooftop building. The facility's heat signature shows that it has now been shut down, almost immediately after Angela Merkel told US President Barack Obama: \"spying among friends -- it cannot be.\" \nThe device was housed in a structure resembling a box --just like the one on the British embassy's roof -- complete with fiberglass windows through which signals could pass without interference. It was reportedly a joint effort by the CIA and NSA, with agents from both agencies picked for the highly classified Special Collection Service (SCS) unit. \nThe \"concealed collection system,\" as the document refers to it, actually depends on \"sheds\" hidden inside fake windows. \"Collection equipment on a building is concealed so as not to reveal SIGNET activity...antennas are sometimes hidden in false architectural features or roof maintenance sheds.\" \nThe secrecy of those missions was nearly air-tight, with work being carried out by a handful of diplomats whose real assignments were unknown even to the majority of their own colleagues. \nThese sites are small in size and in the number of personnel staffing them. They are covert, and their true mission is not known by the majority of the diplomatic staff at the facility where they are assigned,\" the paper said. \nThe document leaked by Snowden explains just how important the embassy bases are as a technology for NSA and other clandestine agencies. So much so that a fake embassy site was once built in a wooded areas outside Washington, DC, to test the efficacy of the spying devices, as well as train field agents for the specific purpose of manning those stations. \nAnd the device outside DC also closely resembles the one atop the British embassy in Berlin. \nHowever, Britain also being Germany's close neighbor, the latest allegations could prove even more damaging than the ones related to the US.

So, if you have the Giro, it's actually faster.\"\n\nAnother commuter, Magdalene Seah, said: \"I really save a lot of time walking to the queue and queuing up, so it's much more convenient.\"\n\nTo promote e-payment top-ups, LTA will conduct a pilot study for three to six months in four MRT stations.\n\nBefore the start of the pilot study, a survey will be conducted with at least 5,000 commuters across various stations.\n\nThe objective is to establish the profile of commuters using cash for top-ups, and how they can be enticed to use e-payments instead to do top-ups.\n\nCommuters' ticketing experience can also be enhanced by new technology that is now available.\n\nOne of them is the Be-In Be-Out system.\n\nThe system is a hands-free process, where commuters can carry their travel card in their pocket or their jacket.\n\nDr Alexander Erath, senior researcher at Future Cities Laboratory, said: \"This means that you don't need to tap in, or tap out anymore, but there is a receiver that recognises if you are in or if you are out, and then it will compute how much time, how much distance you actually spend with what kind of vehicle, and will automatically subtract the value from your account.\n\n\"It's actually faster if you don't need to tap in and tap out.\"\n\nLTA will engage a consultant to study new ticketing technology and what is done in other cities like Hong Kong, and London. \n\nwww.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-reviewing-use-of/1183514.html", "title": "LTA reviewing use of ticketing machines - 20Jun2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-20T20:54:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t6WlG61xJo", "description": "Yesterday on the bus 58 film in three parts", "title": "Lithuanian racist in the bus in london part 3/3", "publishedDate": "2012-04-14T15:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t74TAJKkE4", "description": "Find out more @ \u202ahttp://www.sky.com/dance\n\u2028\u202cLike us on Facebook: \u202ahttps://www.facebook.com/GottoDanceSky1\u202c\nFollow us on Twitter: \u202ahttps://twitter.com/gottodance_sky1\u202c", "title": "GTD 4: Shun Live Performance", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T19:34:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t7E8PTfey0", "description": "SALE TODAY: Learn Piano on iOS http://bit.ly/PianoAppSale\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/finding-the-equation-of-a-line-in-slope-intercept-form\n\nNeed help reviewing math concepts?

Angel trumpet care and culture. How to Grow Burgmansia Trees. Brugmansia is a genus of seven species of flowering plants in the  Solanaceae family. Their large, fragrant flowers give them their common name of angel's trumpets. Brugmansia are easily grown in a fertile, moist,  well-drained soil, in sun to part shade, in frost-free climates. They begin to flower in late spring and continue into the fall, often continuing as late as early winter in warm conditions. In cool winters, outdoor plants need protection from frost, I winter mine in the garage with no trouble. Brugmansia are native to tropical regions of South America,  Brugmansia are fragrant in the evenings to attract pollinating moths. All parts of Brugmansia are poisonous, with the seeds and leaves being dangerous. SO DON\"T EAT THEM!!!\nORCHID CARE, CARNIVOROUS PLANT CULTURE, GARDENS, GREENHOUSES & MORE...

The Ramphastidae family is most closely related to the American barbets. They are brightly marked and have large, often colorful bills. The family includes five genera and about forty different species. The name of this bird group is derived from the Tupi word tukana, via Portuguese. Toucans range in size from the Lettered Aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus), at 130 g (4.6 oz) and 29 cm (11.5 inches), to the Toco Toucan (Ramphastos toco), at 680 g (1.5 lb) and 63 cm (29 inches). Their bodies are short (of comparable size to a crow's) and compact. The tail is rounded and varies in length, from half the length to the whole length of the body. The neck is short and thick. The wings are small, as they are forest-dwelling birds who only need to travel short distances, and are often of about the same span as the bill-tip-to-tail-tip measurements of the bird.\n\nThe legs of a toucan are strong and rather short. Their toes are arranged in pairs with the first and fourth toes turned backward. The majority of toucans do not show any sexual dimorphism in their coloration, the genus Selenidera being the most notable exception to this rule (hence their common name, \"dichromatic toucanets\"). However, the bills of female toucans are usually shorter, deeper and sometimes straighter, giving more of a \"blocky\" impression compared to male bills. The feathers in the genus containing the largest toucans are generally black, with touches of white, yellow, and scarlet. The underparts of the ara\u00e7aris (smaller toucans) are yellow, crossed by one or more black or red bands. The toucanets have mostly green plumage with blue markings. The colorful and large bill, which in some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans. Despite its size, the toucan's bill is very light, being composed of bone struts filled with spongy tissue of keratin between them. The bill has forward-facing serrations resembling teeth, which historically led naturalists to believe that toucans captured fish and were primarily carnivorous; today it is known that they eat mostly fruit. Researchers have discovered that the large bill of the toucan is a highly efficient thermoregulation system, though its size may still be advantageous in other ways. It does aid in their feeding behavior (as they sit in one spot and reach for all fruit in range, thereby reducing energy expenditure), and it has also been theorized that the bill may intimidate smaller birds, so that the toucan may plunder nests undisturbed (see Diet below). Also, the beak allows the bird to reach deep into tree-holes to access food unavailable to other birds, and also to ransack suspended nests built by smaller birds. However, as there is no sexual dimorphism in coloration it is unlikely to be a sexual signal.\n\nA toucan's tongue is long (up to 14--15 cm, or 6 inches), narrow, grey, and singularly frayed on each side, adding to its sensitivity as an organ of taste.\n\nA structural complex probably unique to toucans involves the modification of several tail vertebrae. The rear three vertebrae are fused and attached to the spine by a ball and socket joint. Because of this, toucans may snap their tail forwards until it touches the head. This is the posture in which they sleep, often appearing simply as a ball of feathers, with the tip of the tail sticking out over the head.\n\nToucans are arboreal and typically lay 2--4 white eggs in their nests. They make their nests in tree hollows and holes excavated by other animals such as woodpeckers\u2014the toucan bill has very limited use as an excavation tool. When the eggs hatch, the young emerge completely naked, without any down. Toucans are resident breeders and do not migrate. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists hypothesize they do to establish dominance hierarchies.", "title": "Very Pretty Toucan Bird at the Atlanta Zoo, he only sits still for a few seconds at a time.", "publishedDate": "2012-09-09T07:15:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3tJvSvOFs14", "description": "USA resan", "title": "Universal Studios", "publishedDate": "2009-03-24T17:21:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3tKJ6oZOkNo", "description": "Join Extreme AutoMoto gorup on facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/extremeAM\n\nSome guys from USA i suppose prank people with diesel truck.

Resulta que, cuando una persona est\u00e1 bajo estr\u00e9s, se eleva una hormona llamada cortisol u hormona del estr\u00e9s.\n\nEl mecanismo de acci\u00f3n de \u00e9sta es preparar al cuerpo para una reacci\u00f3n de \"hu\u00edda o lucha\", de donde luego va a resultar en un aumento de apetito, generalmente hacia los carbohidratos.\n\nEsta acumulaci\u00f3n de grasa no solo ocurre en personas con sobrepeso. Se ha observado que las mujeres delgadas con altos niveles de estr\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n tienen mayor tendencia a acumular grasa a nivel abdominal.\n\nEs as\u00ed como, adem\u00e1s de tratar de llevar un estilo de vida m\u00e1s relajado y de verdadera calidad, usted debe tener en cuenta diferentes puntos para mejorar su salud:\n\n\u2022 Mantenga una alimentaci\u00f3n saludable y variada, guiada idealmente por un profesional en nutrici\u00f3n.\n\n\u2022 Inicie una rutina de ejercicio que sea complemento a su estilo de vida, le ayude a eliminar el sobrepeso y a tener un gasto de calor\u00edas mayor cada d\u00eda. La Asociaci\u00f3n Americana de Cardiolog\u00eda recomienda hacer m\u00ednimo 150 minutos por semana para mantener un buen peso y salud. Dentro de ello, incluya ejercicios aer\u00f3bicos o cardiovasculares. Los ejercicios abdominales no son necesarios hasta que usted haya eliminado esa grasa en exceso de su est\u00f3mago mediante ejercicio aer\u00f3bico.\n\n\u2022 Como complemento a un estilo de vida m\u00e1s saludable, incluya ejercicios de relajaci\u00f3n. Puede incorporar ejercicios de respiraci\u00f3n.\n\n\u2022 Consuma 5 \u00f3 6 tiempos de comida al d\u00eda, es decir, coma frecuentemente pero en cantidades peque\u00f1as y comidas bajas en calor\u00edas.\n\n\u2022 Beba dos litros de agua o l\u00edquido sin calor\u00edas por d\u00eda para una mejor hidrataci\u00f3n.\n\n\u2022 Evite consumir alimentos altos en grasas saturadas como mantequilla, natilla, queso crema, manteca, helados cremosos, comida chatarra o r\u00e1pida, reposter\u00eda, cremas para el caf\u00e9, entre otros.\n\n\u2022 Opte por un consumo moderado de grasas. Prefiere las monoinsaturadas como el aceite de oliva o de canola, aguacate, nueces, aceitunas, y poliinsaturadas, como pescados grasosos (at\u00fan, salm\u00f3n, trucha salmonada), algunas nueces y semillas.\n\n\u2022 Consuma pescado idealmente unas dos a tres veces por semana.\n\n\u2022 Reduzca el consumo de az\u00facar, y utilice alg\u00fan edulcorante para endulzar aquellas bebidas que lo necesiten.\n\naprende a sacar abdominales rapidamente: http://tinyurl.com/Sacar-Abdominales\n\nquemar grasa abdominal\ncomo quemar grasa abdominal\nejercicios para quemar grasa abdominal\ncomo quemar grasa abdominal rapidamente\ndieta para quemar grasa abdominal\nquemar grasa abdominal rapidamente\ndietas para quemar grasa abdominal\ndieta quemar grasa abdominal\nalimentos para quemar grasa abdominal\nejercicios quemar grasa abdominal\njugos para quemar grasa abdominal\nproductos para quemar grasa abdominal\nrutina para quemar grasa abdominal", "title": "9 Trucos Para Quemar Grasa Abdominal -  Como Perder Grasa de la panza", "publishedDate": "2011-12-01T18:17:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3tQvrGC_14U", "description": "Potulice (Wielkopolska) 16.05.2014.", "title": "pokl\u0105skwa (Saxicola rubetra), Whinchat, Braunkehlchen", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T18:11:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3tRLll52SeM", "description": "En 2072 los asesinatos est\u00e1n terminantemente prohibidos y los objetivos son enviados a trav\u00e9s de una m\u00e1quina del tiempo al pasado, al a\u00f1o 2042, donde existe una red de sicarios, conocidos como Loopers, que se encargan de acabar con ellos y deshacerse r\u00e1pidamente de los cuerpos.

We want our workplaces run for the benefit of workers and communities rather than for a handful of bosses and executives.\n\nWe are the Industrial Workers of the World because we organize industrially.\n\nThis means we organize all workers producing the same goods or providing the same services into one union, rather than dividing workers by skill or trade, so we can pool our strength to win our demands together.

We organize the worker, not the job, and recognize that unions are not about government certification or employer recognition but about workers coming together to address common concerns.\n\nSometimes this means refusing to work with dangerous equipment and chemicals.\n\nSometimes it means striking or signing a contract. Other times it mean agitating around particular issues or grievances in a workplace or industry.\n\nThe IWW is a democratic, member-run union.

So gaillardia or blanket flower is found from southern America all the way down through Mexico into South America. So they love hot full sun and dry hot summers. They like hot full sun and really dry summers. They want to drink some water but they want to really dry out in between. They look just like little sunflowers but they come in gorgeous colors, reds and yellows and bright pinks and purples and they're named blanket flower because when the Europeans came to America, they found them everywhere and the Native Americans had blankets that had all the different colors in them. So the fields of the gaillardia reminded them of the Indian blankets so they called them the blanket flower. So gaillardia gets to be about three feet tall and you can actually dead head them and cut the blooms off as they fade and they'll produce more blooms over the summer and they'll bloom into the fall till the first frost. And they're an annual so you have to start them by seed every spring and that way you can enjoy them every summer and you'll enjoy those gaillardias, they're a great, great flower.\nFlower Shops In Yuma Arizona | Flower Rangoli Designs | Flowers Of War", "title": "Flower Shops In Yuma Arizona | Flower Rangoli Designs | Flowers Of War", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T12:05:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t_ZjetcSMQ", "description": "", "title": "yom yeru 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T19:45:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3t_h4qDXY-I", "description": "NOT FOR SENSITIVE VIEWERS.

The zygote undergoes repeated divisions until it reaches 16 cells (morula). Between the 4th and the 5th day, the morula becomes a blastocyst. Some of these cells give rise to the foetal placenta and the rest to the embryo. Six days after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches itself to the endometrium through a process called implantation.", "title": "EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLANTATION", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T15:57:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3u2WVvNnGcI", "description": "Wal-Mart has a price-matching service that will match the lower price of an item if you find it online and provide proof.

When I translate them, I try to keep them in the same word order as in Finnish. I believe you're smart enough to get the sentences without the correct places of each word. Like for example: \"Sleeps a lion\" is in the same word order as in Finnish BUT if I was in school I'd have to translate it like \"A lion sleeps\". Get the point? Good!

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.", "title": "Hairdo Ideas Magazine", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21T21:35:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3uPZMueMx-0", "description": "First aid using helichrysum essential oil to aid in controlling the bleeding.", "title": "Helichrysum to the Rescue", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T05:31:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3uPbBsjjI9I", "description": "Showcasing the Greybeard skin for Veigar.", "title": "iLeague of Legends - Veigar Greybeard Skin (HD)", "publishedDate": "2011-04-08T17:15:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3uQH_vcsuIg", "description": "\u25ba Reddit Thread: http://bit.ly/1om5Fzd\n\u25ba Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/168j0QO\n---------------------------------------------\nEVERYONE gets #EGF in the new mode.

Woodlice form the suborder Oniscidea within the order Isopoda, with over 5,000 known species.\n\nWoodlice in the genus Armadillidium can roll up into an almost perfect sphere as a defensive mechanism, hence some of the common names such as pill bug or roly-poly. Most woodlice, however, cannot do this.\n\nThe woodlouse has a shell-like exoskeleton, which it must progressively shed as it grows. The moult takes place in two stages; the back half is lost first, followed two or three days later by the front. This method of moulting is different from that of most arthropods, which shed their cuticle in a single process. Metabolic rate is temperature-dependent in woodlice. In contrast to mammals and birds, invertebrates are not \"self heating\": the external environmental temperature relates directly to their rate of respiration.\n\nA female woodlouse will keep fertilised eggs in a marsupium on the underside of her body until they hatch into small, white offspring. The mother then appears to \"give birth\" to her offspring. Females are also capable of reproducing asexually.\nDespite being crustaceans like lobsters or crabs, woodlice are said to have an unpleasant taste similar to \"strong urine\".\"\n\nPlease visit my other channels:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/meerkatist\nhttp://www.youtube.com/glenharfield\nhttp://www.youtube.com/placesivevisited\nhttp://www.youtube.com/headchins\nhttp://www.youtube.com/altermation", "title": "Woodlouse on the Run", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T19:16:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3uVhfFFBpA8", "description": "Buy on iTunes: http://georiot.co/U9h\n\nCr2 is proud to welcome young Pierce Fulton back to the label with his latest release 'Runaway'.

Find this and many more recipes with pictures on the Giallozafferano App (in English) http://itunes.apple.com/app/giallozafferano-recipes/id384387249?mt=8\n\n***\n\nWelcome to the GialloZafferano kitchen. I'm Sonia and today we'll be preparing a pasta dish from the Emilia-Romagna region -- Lasagne Bolognese\nLet's look at the ingredients we'll need:\n\u2022 4.5 cups (1 kg) of B\u00e9chamel sauce\n\u2022 3 cups (1 kg) of ragu Bolognese -- you can find the recipe on the GialloZafferano site.\n\u2022 1.5 cups (200 g) of grated parmesan cheese\n\u2022 1 pound (500 g) of fresh egg lasagne noodles\n\u2022 Extra virgin olive oil\nOK, let's see how to prepare our Lasagne Bolognese.\nBegin by getting a pan that's about 8x12 inches (20x30 cm). Add a thin layer of olive oil and spread a spoonful of sauce at the bottom of the pan. This will keep the bottom of the lasagne from burning. After this, begin to lay down the sheets of lasagne. You can cut them to fit the size of your pan and use the trimmings to cover any space leftover. Now add a layer of b\u00e9chamel, spread it out, and add another layer of sauce. Keep in mind that you'll want to make about four layers including the cover, so measure your ingredients according to the room you have in the pan. Now, sprinkle with a layer of parmesan cheese. Go on like this with the other layers.\nI'm finishing here with the last layer. Spread the b\u00e9chamel right up to the corners, and finish everything with a layer of sauce. The last layer can get a bit more sauce than the rest. Give a generous sprinkling of the parmesan, and now we're ready to bake the lasagne Bolognese for about an hour at 320\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). \nOur Lasagne Bolognese is ready. Remember that after you've baked it, leave it to rest for at least 15 minutes so that the layers can settle, which will make cutting portions much easier.

People who spend time in prison told NewsChannel9's Briona Arradondo that their past record works against them when they want to be productive members of society.\n\nNorman Williams, a Chattanooga resident of East Lake Courts, said he has a criminal record, and he said he is working to put that life behind him.\n\n\"Honestly, first of all, it starts with jobs,\" said Williams. \n\nBut he and others said there are reasons some people have trouble doing so. Williams said having a felony record hurts their chances.\n\n\"When you sit down for this interview, and you give those folks your whole life, you cry to them, and then they say 'Well we want you so bad but we can't hire you because of such in such,'\" said Williams. \"That was 10 years ago in my life.\" Williams added that they are willing to work their way to the top if they could get a job to support their families.\n\nSomeone can request his or her record to be expunged through an application through the court system, if they qualify. There is a list of offenses that included in the expunction, such as forgery, theft up to $999 and auto burglary, and excluded from the expunction list, such as assault, violation of a restraining order, child abuse, indecent exposure and possession of a firearm after convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\n\nSome organizations can step in to help, like Hope for the Inner City. Vincent Boozer, the executive director of Father to the Fatherless, guides people involved in street violence toward more productive avenues.\n\n\"We also have guys that are working for me that are from that life that's changed and transitioned,\" said Boozer. \"So, we're showing guys that you can do it, instead of just telling them.\"\n\nThat kind of show of good faith is also what Assistant Chief Tracy Arnold told NewsChannel9 they are working to do with victims.\n\n\"There are often times people that perhaps didn't live the most wholesome life out there, but they changed their life around,\" said Arnold. \"They are viewed by some people in the community as someone they can look up to.\"\n\nArnold added that all community leaders he has spoken with want to guide people involved in crime down the right path.              \n\nChurch leaders said someone can get a copy of the petition to expunge a criminal record at Olivet Baptist Church.\n\nBy Briona Arradondo", "title": "Community Members Name Jobs As Potential Cause%2", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T22:17:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ubOt1ob37A", "description": "Class Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/12N1zA5\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nEllen (Jacqueline Bisset) seduces Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) in a glass elevator.\n\nTM & \u00a9 MGM (2012)\nCast: Andrew McCarthy, Jacqueline Bisset\nDirector: Lewis John Carlino\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://j.mp/13a8iYb\nProducer: Jill Chadwick, David Greenwalt, Martin Ransohoff, Cathleen Summers, Jim Kouf\nScreenwriter: David Greenwalt, Jim Kouf\nFilm Description: With a plot that is a cross between a teen, low-brow farce and a coming-of-age story, Class opens with scenes of two best friends -- nerdy whiz Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) and carefree jock Skip (Rob Lowe) -- going around in lingerie; they also barf on a double date, break into a quiet meeting at a girls' school, and generally behave as emotional throwbacks. But when the nerd Jonathan is picked up in a Chicago bar by Skip's mother Ellen (Jacqueline Bisset), the tone changes completely. The affair between the student and the older woman is torrid until they rendezvous in New York and Ellen dumps Jonathan because she finds out he is not a Ph.D. candidate from Northwestern University.

Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it. The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as 24 inches (60 cm) long and 8 inches (20 cm) wide. While most casts have five toes \u2014 like all known apes \u2014 some casts of alleged Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six.Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.Proponents claim that Bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal.

Last year, Iran successfully tested its upgraded Shahab-3 ballistic missile, the striking distance of which include Turkey, Israel, the Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nWashington's missile defenses in Europe, Israel and the Gulf are separate projects in different stages of development. But they all will be controlled by the US military, the Washington Post said. NATO has its own plans of creating a missile shield to cover Europe.\n\nUnder former President George W. Bush, the US was actively developing the missile shield program for Europe, which was heavily criticized by Moscow. However, in September 2009 President Barack Obama scrapped the plans to deploy elements of the missile defense shield in the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nHowever, Obama also pledged to develop a new missile shield for Europe with \"a phased, adaptive approach.\" US officials say the first stage will become operational next year when Aegis ships, armed with SM-3 missile interceptors start patrolling the Mediterranean and Black seas. They are supposed to be linked up with the high-power radar planned for Southern Europe.\n\nIn February, Romania said it was ready to host US interceptor missiles from 2015.

Il video \u00e8 composto da 600 autoscatti fotografici scelti tra pi\u00f9 di mille. Le foto sono state da me realizzate in momenti di vita giornaliera. \n\"Il sistema politico e sociale che ci vogliono far vivere usura l'individuo, fino ad annientarlo, spersonalizzarlo, lasciandolo incosciente davanti a tutto. L'unica salvezza \u00e8 dentro se stessi. Questa tensione e senso di costrizione soffocante l'ho espressa attraverso l'uso di calze, simbolo femminile, che diventa invece trappola di morte interiore, ostacolo con il ricongiungimento alla natura. La natura \u00e8 il tema che si pone difronte al mio senso di prigionia data dal meccanismo sociale imposto. Ecco che si ripete spesso una finestra ossessiva a straniante ripetizione verso naturali mancanze, che taglia il campo cercando un contatto intimo con me. Il video termina con ambienti lasciati vuoti poich\u00e9 c'\u00e8 indifferenza completa nell'intorno, e l'individuo \u00e8 subdolo tanto da non lasciare tracce visibili e appariscenti. La consapevolezza pu\u00f2 espandersi oltre la portata del nostro ego, oltre la nostra identit\u00e0 personale, familiare, la nostra auto, la nostra tv, al di l\u00e0 di tutto quello che abbiamo imparato, oltre la nostra nozione di spazio e tempo, al di l\u00e0 delle differenze che la gente e il sistema attua per separare gli uni dagli altri. Basta essere presenti a noi stessi e pian piano i pensieri torneranno ad essere i nostri. Questo \u00e8 \"Human Alienation\".\n\nSYNOPSIS ENG: \"Human Alienation\" is a photographic/video self-portrait about political-social denunciation, made by me during my life in Berlin in 2011. The video includes 600 photographic self-portraits chosen from more than a thousand. The photos were made by me in different moments of my daily life.\nThe political and social system they want us to live in is wearing us out to the point of de-personalization and annihilation: we're left in a state of unconsciousness. The only way out is inside of us.\nI expressed this tension by using a pair of stockings, a very powerful female symbol, which I transform into an emotional and psychological death trap, an obstacle to reunification with Nature. Nature is the leitmotif I\nchoose to hold before the sense of imprisonment which is imposed by the social mechanism. And then, there's a window. An obsessive image that keeps appearing to reiterate alienation, separation from what one is naturally missing. A window that limits the screen and allows for a more intimate contact with one's inner self. The video ends with empty spaces to indicate absolute indifference. Human beings are cunning: they don't leave any conspicuous or visible traces behind. Awareness can expand beyond our egos, beyond our personal identity, our family, our cars, our TV, beyond all that we have learned, beyond our notions of space and time, beyond the differences that people and the system implement to separate from each other.

And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?\n9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,\n10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.\n11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.\n12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:\n13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.\n14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.\n15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.\n16 \u00b6And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.\n17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath--jearim.\n18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.\n19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.\n20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.\n21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.\n22 \u00b6And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?\n23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.\n24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.\n25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.\n26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.\n27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.", "title": "Joshua 9 thoughts", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T21:09:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3v96CBU9MhE", "description": "Red Harlow's taunts from Legends & Killers DLC", "title": "RDR: Red Harlow", "publishedDate": "2010-08-10T23:44:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3v98CPXNiSk", "description": "anyone who uses this video to promote Botox etc. is a douchebag.\n\nBitchy Resting Face is a disorder that affects millions of women every day.

He and his female assistant, whom he said was a geomancer, met the woman in the feng shui store where she worked in July, convincing her of their supernatural powers. The store employee, we'll call Xin, confided in the pair over tea later on that she was in love with an unavailable man. Under the pretext of helping her, the two told Xin to book a room at a nearby hotel, specifically room A12 on the fourth floor, as that space had the strongest \"chi\" and they had performed many successful rituals there before.\n\nXin did as she was told, and was instructed at the hotel to shower and put on some lingerie, the purpose of which was so they could see what was in her body. At this point, the \"geomancer\" told Xin that she had been cursed, and only the master could set her free. They told Xin they would perform a ritual for the low price of 32,000 yuan, which works out to be about US$5,200. Only able to pay 20,000 yuan up front, Huang \"convinced\" his assistant to loan Xin the remaining 12,000 yuan, which would be paid off within 49 days, or her ghost would return.\n\nXin arrived at Huang's house the next day, where she said she was too nervous to sleep - an apparently integral part of the process - so she was given sleeping pills to swallow with a bottle of beer. Again, she was told to shower and put on lingerie picked out by Huang, who told her that he could see a demon in her hoo ha, and the only way to get it out, apparently, was by inserting his ding-a-ling.\n\nHuang dispelled any reservations Xin might have had about the situation by saying they weren't actually having sex, as he put a condom on.\n\nAfter the ritual was done, Xin came to her senses, and reported what had happened to police. She also said Huang claimed to have exorcised the evil spirit hiding in her privates in under five minutes, and said he was virgin who had never touched women before, so performing the ritual was actually a huge sacrifice for HIM.\n\nPolice managed to track Huang down and apprehended him on August 1, at which point he denied everything. According to Huang, he not allowed to do such things as a Taoist priest, and that authorities were welcome to have a doctor check. He also claimed to have severe diabetes that left him impotent for a long time. Oh, and he was also almost blind, he said.\n\nAuthorities probably didn't believe him.\n\nReports on the sexorcism below!\n\nhttp://shanghaiist.com/2013/08/18/chinese_master_dragon_seeker_uses_his_penis_to_exorcise_a_womans_vagina_demons.php\n\nhttp://www.s1979.com/news/society/201308/1898288018.shtml\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTomoNews is your daily source for top animated news.

A remarkable reproduction of a Historic Deerfield, MA 1750s country house on nearly 5 heavily wooded, quiet, peaceful acres, just 5 minutes from St Marys Hospital. Architectural details by Frederic C Jay of Richmond, VA, built by Rochester Master Builder, Reuben C Wolfgram. During 2012-13, this home has been thoroughly updated inside and out. See supplement.\n\nEnjoy authentic New England details, 4 wood-burning fireplaces, the latest mechanical systems, hidden privacy at roads end with year-round wild-life and walking trails.\n\nThe cypress doors and doorway are hand-crafted reproductions of the John Williams House in Historic Deerfield, the chimney pieces in the living room and dining rooms are exact reproductions from the Dwight Barnard House and the Ashley House in Deerfield. Lighting fixtures were hand-crafted by Gates Moore of Connecticut, blue and white biblical scene fireplace tiles from the Chicago Art Institute, wallpaper from Metropolitan Museum of Art, 8 inch plank heart-pine and quarry tile brick flooring, wainscoting, window seats, bay window, bookshelves, china cupboard built-ins, heavy crown moulding, chair rails, summer beams in living room and dining rooms and rustic old barn beams from Fountain, MN in family room and kitchen. The living room and dining room dimensions are the same as the Hunter House in Newport, Rhode Island. There are cupboards especially designed for china, silver serving pieces, folding chairs, champagne glasses, photo albums, placemats and formal gowns...you name it, we have it!!\n\nThe study (could be 5th bedroom) off the master suite and the screened porch off the breakfast room are very special places for the family who designed this home and have enjoyed it for 42 years! Stairway to third floor attic, storeroom over the garage, and tons of open storage in lower level have been great for retaining family treasures for generations! Birch cabinetry, wainscoting, flooring have been recently re-finished. Entire home has been freshly stained or painted throughout. New electrical updates...new stainless Energy Star appliances, new carpeting, new roofing and even a new septic system. There are front and back stairways to the second floor which accommodated growing kids through several stages. There is a curved stair to the lower level and a cellar door from exterior for unloading mowers, bikes, and big stuff. Electrical service, phone, television and internet service are underground from a pole in the woods to the house.\n\nOur wooded acreage has been a wonderful retreat...low key, minimal mowing, natural woods, wild flowers, birds, deer, wild turkey, ferns...every species of trees and bushes. This is a wave at your neighbors area...a good place to walk when you want to visit! Rochester Township clears the road/hill early on winter days...This is close-in country living...2013 conveniences with authentic 1750s details, hardware, ambiance.", "title": "4310 Meadow Ridge Dr SW | Marilyn Stewart", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T17:47:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vSDvkutwxM", "description": "MAYA - svajon\u0117s\nMuzika: Arvydas Martin\u0117nas. \u017dod\u017eiai:Antanas Nedzinskas, Arvydas Martin\u0117nas.\nVideo: Arvydas Martin\u0117nas\n(C) VuRecords.lt    http://www.vurecords.lt", "title": "MAYA - Svajon\u0117s (Official video) 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T12:28:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vSEILQEBbs", "description": "It really doesn't take Sean Whitaker very much time to put together a sick edit.\nShot and Cut: Seamus Foster\n@sagaouterwear\n@weanshitaker\n@brightonresort\n#sagafam", "title": "DOWNTIME: Two Hours W/ Sean", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T16:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vSHA1jloIc", "description": "", "title": "The Evolution of the Horse", "publishedDate": "2010-04-15T00:32:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vSWkAskL80", "description": "With Wii Light Sabers\nThe song is Less Sugarless by Outgate via Creative Commons Noncommercial Share-alike license.\nFor some reason, I can't post comments!

Nutmeg is harvested through out the year in South India.\n\nNutmeg and mace (known in India as jayphal / jayaphala and javitri) are grown in various parts including Kerala and Goa. They comprise a premium family of spices that are also used in Indian cooking.\n\nThe nutmeg tree is any of several species of trees in genus Myristica. The most important commercial species is Myristica fragrans, an evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (or Spice Islands) of Indonesia. The nutmeg tree is important for two spices derived from the fruit: nutmeg and mace.\n\nNutmeg is the seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to 1 in) long and 15 to 18 mm (0.6 to 0.7 in) wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g (0.2 and 0.4 oz) dried, while mace is the dried \"lacy\" reddish covering or aril of the seed. The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7--9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after 20 years. Nutmeg is usually used in powdered form. This is the only tropical fruit that is the source of two different spices. Several other commercial products are also produced from the trees, including essential oils, extracted oleoresins, and nutmeg butter.\n\nThe common or fragrant nutmeg, Myristica fragrans, native to the Banda Islands of Indonesia, is also grown in Penang Island in Malaysia and the Caribbean, especially in Grenada. It also grows in Kerala, a state in southern India. Other species of nutmeg include Papuan nutmeg M. argentea from New Guinea, and Bombay nutmeg M. malabarica from India, called jaiphal in Hindi; both are used as adulterants of M. fragrans products.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Rice is the staple of our country. So the price of rice went up and there was an attempt to try to stabilize the price by increasing it, so as to provide incentive for domestic production, and that led to riots. Now the riot said to be based on rice really was also a result of political turbulence, because there already was the movement to challenge the status quo. We had had the monopolization of power and privilege in the country for a long time, and the educated indigenous population was already emboldened. So the shortage of rice provided an excuse for that. But that led to over-reactive force by the government that left a lot of people dead. People were then imprisoned, and so the soldiers then, a year later, decided to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat. These were uncommissioned officers, and as you know, there was tremendous brutality associated with that, where 13 people were tied to stakes on a beach and shot. So many people were killed.

I'm looking at this lovely selection of Solidago rugosa, they're the Goldenrods in common parlance.  This thing is full of pollinators, I'm seeing Bumblebees, honeybees, and there's some kind of hornet in the middle here. It's a wonderful late season wildflower, also it's a great cut flower.\n\nWhat I like about Solidago rugosa - fireworks is it stays fairly small.  A lot of the Solidagos are very aggressive plants, not only setting seed and spreading by the germination of seeds, but also underground runners.  They will colonize an area very quickly. Solidago rugosa - fireworks is a little bit more restrained, it plays nice in the garden.  They call it fireworks for reason, these lovely sprays of golden yellow flowers pointing the same way on the branch.  That's a lovely, lovely trait on this particular variety of Solidago rugosa.\n\nAnother interesting aspect about Solidago the genus is that in the early part of the twentieth century the rubber tree had gone into a serious decline because of a disease that affected all of the rubber plantings.  So they were looking for other sources for rubber and Thomas Edison was working on cultural techniques and a breeding program to create a Solidago that would provide a source for rubber.  He ended up with a twelve foot Solidago plant, and actually his friend Henry Ford delivered a Model-T to Thomas Edison with tires made from rubber from Solidago!\n\nIn the genus Solidago there are over a hundred and twenty species, we looked at Solidago - fireworks.  I'm not sure which one this is, but I want to emphasize that there are different sizes of plants.  The Solidago rugosa - fireworks, rather small, two and a half or three feet and some of the others species can get well over five or six feet tall.  They are very aggressive plants if you allow them to set seed, they will set seed all over your garden the underground runners will also colonize an area very quickly. They do like full sun, they will tolerate light shade.  Solidagos are very forgiving as to soils they are tolerant of just about the type of soil except the very boggy soils.  They do well in dry locations, they do will near road sides which makes me think that there are salt tolerant.\n\nSolidago, a wonderful American wildflower.", "title": "Goldenrod - Solidago rugosa 'Fireworks'", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T20:18:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vw4I2jVIwE", "description": "Arminius HW 9 Target Trophy Combat  .22 LR Revolver  Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\narminius hw 9 katalog\narminius hw 357\narminius hw 9 gr\narminius hw 9\narminius 38 special\narminius 357\narminius revolver hw 9\narminiusedits\narminius trailer\narminius revolver\narminius enemy of rome\narminius hw-37 kal.9mm", "title": "Arminius HW 9 Target Trophy Combat  .22 LR Revolver  Images", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T00:12:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vwCazlVCg0", "description": "Giant Anteater caught on camera trap 500 m from the Amazon Rainforest Conservation Center Lodge in Las Piedras Peru", "title": "Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) at ARCC, Las Piedras, Peru", "publishedDate": "2013-02-15T05:47:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vwPgX24g28", "description": "Short animation explaining what is Inflation, what is the CPI, how it is calculated and how Inflation should be measured more accurately in Lebanon.\n\nThis production is part of the Lebanese Economic Association project (TheLEAproject): Upgrading Lebanon's Economic Analytical Capacity; a project funded by the International Development Research Centre, Canada.\n\nLebanese Economic Association\nHamra Street, Beirut/Lebanon\nTel:  +961-1-74 80 20\nFax: +961-1-74 80 19\nE-mail: info@leb-econ.org\nWebsite: www.leb-econ.org\nhttp://www.facebook.com/joinlea", "title": "What is Inflation?", "publishedDate": "2012-06-13T20:49:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3vwq1AyYGzo", "description": "In an interview from the early 60's, I believe by Janos Darvas, Igor Stravinsky humorously recalls playing The Rite of Spring for Sergei Diaghilev whose company, The Ballet Russes, would be dancing to this groundbreaking, albeit bizarre, score.

In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. The oil reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate.\n\nThis seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years. From time to time, the asphalt would form a deposit thick enough to trap animals, and the surface would be covered with layers of water, dust, or leaves. Animals would wander in, become trapped, and eventually die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and also become stuck.\n\nThe tar pits visible today are actually from human excavation. The lake pit was originally an asphalt mine. The other pits visible today were produced between 1913 and 1915, when over 100 pits were excavated in search of large mammal bones. Various combinations of asphaltum and water have since filled in these holes. Normally, the asphalt appears in vents, hardening as it oozes out, to form stubby mounds. These can be seen in several areas of the park.\n\nAs the bones of dead animals sink into the asphalt, it soaks into them, turning them a dark-brown or black color. Lighter fractions of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance, which encases the bones. Dramatic fossils of large mammals have been extricated from the tar, but the asphalt also preserves microfossils: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and even pollen grains. Examples of some of these are on display in the museum.\n\nRadiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps. The pits still ensnare organisms today, so most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals.", "title": "La Brea Tar Pits Los Angeles", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T14:34:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3w1c7i1yuis", "description": "Track 2 from 'Ecstatic Communion' by Paul Armitage and singer Lauren Pomerantz.
