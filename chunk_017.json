Que faut-il examiner ? Nous avons besoin d\u00e9tailler la question. \nLa base chez le musulman c'est la droiture, et si le but de la recherche sur ce fr\u00e8re est de questionner : \u00ab Untel quelle est sa situation ? \u00bb\n\n[Par exemple] j'ai pri\u00e9 derri\u00e8re un imam \u00e0 la mosqu\u00e9e, est-ce que je demande s'il fait partie des adorateurs des tombes ou pas ?

Quelle est la base ? La droiture.\n\nQuant \u00e0 la question de celui qui prononce l'attestation de foi et la contredit, est-il \nmusulman ou pas? Par exemple une personne atteste que nulle divinit\u00e9 n'est digne d'\u00eatre ador\u00e9e en dehors d'Allah et que Mohammad est le Messager d'Allah puis immole pour les habitants des tombes et leur adresse des v\u0153ux et recherche leurs secours\n\nEst-il musulman? Non, il n'est pas musulman.\nLa divergence repose sur le fait de savoir s'il est excus\u00e9 si la preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, est-il excus\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d'Allah ou non ?\nVoil\u00e0 o\u00f9 se situe la divergence\n\nMais on l'appelle polyth\u00e9iste et son acte est appel\u00e9 polyth\u00e9isme\n\nMais si tu es en train de le conseiller, tu ne commences pas en lui disant : \u00ab Tu es polyth\u00e9iste ! \u00bb  Non serviteur d'Allah ! Avertis-le, clarifie lui l'unicit\u00e9 (d'Allah) en premier, puis clarifie lui ce qui s'y oppose.\nEnsuite utilise un style affectueux, dis lui :\u00ab \u00d4 serviteur d'Allah ! Cette \u0153uvre repr\u00e9sente ceci, cela et j'ai de l'attention pour toi, je suis ton fr\u00e8re musulman. J'aime pour toi ce que j'aime pour moi. \u00bb\n\nLa divergence qui existe est : peut-il avoir des excuses aupr\u00e8s d'Allah, alors qu'il vit dans un pays musulman ? Certains disent : Comment ? Il lit la parole d'Allah, Le Puissant, Le Majestueux : \n{ Ceux qui ont pris en dehors d'Allah des divinit\u00e9s disent : Nous ne les adorons que pour nous rapprocher d'Allah d'avantage ! }\nComment peut-il ignorer qu'invoquer des morts repr\u00e9sente du polyth\u00e9isme ? \nEt pourtant malgr\u00e9 tout, cela peut lui \u00e9chapper ! \nCar il n'a personne pour l'avertir et le menac\u00e9 (de la menace d'Allah).\n\nDonc a-t-il des excuses aupr\u00e8s d'Allah ?

When you file bankruptcy, your creditors are barred from contacting you about your debts or taking any type of collection action against you. This means they can not call you, send you letters, sue you in state court, garnish your wages or bank accounts or continue a garnishment that may already be in place. In addition they cannot repossess your car or foreclose on your house without permission from the bankruptcy court.  The automatic stay goes into affect immediately upon your filing a case. However, the creditor does have to know that you have filed. One thing we do for our clients is to contact any creditor who has a state court action pending or who has repossessed a car or is trying to foreclose on a house. We advise them of the bankruptcy filing and, if applicable, notify the state court also of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, when I file a Chapter 13 case, I normally provide my clients with a receipt from the bankruptcy court that has their case number on it.

If you have an ugly \"toad\" inside you, my son, let it out! As I have always advised you, the first thing you must mention is what you wouldn't like anybody to know. Once the \"toad\" has been let out in Confession -- how well one feels. \nThe Forge, 193 \n\nA real miracle of God's Love\nForward, no matter what happens! Cling tightly to Our Lord's hand and remember that God does not lose battles. If you should stray from him for any reason, react with the humility that will lead you to begin again and again; to play the role of the prodigal son every day, and even repeatedly during the twenty-four hours of the same day; to correct your contrite heart in Confession, which is a real miracle of God's Love. In this wonderful Sacrament Our Lord cleanses your soul and fills you with joy and strength to prevent you from giving up the fight, and to help you keep returning to God unwearied, when everything seems black. In addition, the Mother of God, who is also our Mother, watches over you with motherly care, guiding your every step. \nFriends of God, 214\n\nGod comes out to meet and forgive us.\nFor a Christian, joy is a treasure. Only by offending God do we lose it, because sin is the fruit of selfishness, and selfishness is the root of sadness. Even then, a bit of joy survives under the debris of our soul: the knowledge that neither God nor his Mother can ever forget us. If we repent, if an act of sorrow springs from our heart, if we purify ourselves in the holy sacrament of penance, God comes out to meet and forgive us. Then there can be no sadness whatsoever. Then there is every right \"to rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come back to life, was lost and has been found (St. Luke 15:32).\" \nChrist Is Passing By, 178\n\nA divine dialogue\nSacramental confession is not a human but a divine dialogue. It is a tribunal of divine justice and especially of mercy, with a loving judge who \"has no pleasure in the death of the wicked; I desire that the wicked turn back from his way and live.\" (Ezek 18:23) \nChrist Is Passing By, 78\n\n\"Blessed be God\" you said to yourself after having finished your sacramental confession. And you thought: it is as if I had just been born again. \nYou then continued calmly: \"Domine, quid me vis facere? -Lord, what would you have me do?\"\nAnd you yourself came up with the reply: \"By the help of your grace I will let nothing and no one come between me and the fulfillment of your most Holy Will: Serviam - I will serve you unconditionally.\"\nThe Forge, 238\n\nGod's forgiveness\nYou wrote to tell me that you have at last gone to confession and that you experienced the humiliation of having to open the sewer - that is what you say - of your life to \"a man\". \nWhen will you get rid of that feeling of vain self-esteem? You will then go to confession happy to show yourself as you are to \"that man\", who, being anointed, is another Christ - Christ himself - and gives you absolution, God's forgiveness. \nFurrow, 45\nhttp://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/sacramental-confession-\nWhat depths of mercy there are in God's justice! For, in the judgements of men, he who confesses his fault is punished: and in the Judgement of God, he is pardoned. \nBlessed be the holy Sacrament of Penance! \nThe Way, 309 \n\nAnother fall, and what a fall! Must you give up hope? No. Humble yourself and, through Mary, your Mother, have recourse to the merciful Love of Jesus. A miserere, and lift up your heart! And now begin again. \nThe Way, 711 \n\n\"Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart ... '' The humility of Jesus!...What a lesson for you who are a poor earthenware vessel. He, always merciful, has raised you up, and made the light of the sun of grace shine upon your baseness, which has now been freely exalted. And you, how often you have covered your pride under a cloak of dignity or justice...! And how many chances to learn from the Master you have wasted by not knowing how to supernaturalize them! \nFurrow, 261 \n\nGet accustomed to entrusting your poor heart to the Sweet and Immaculate Heart of Mary, so that she may purify it from so much dross, and lead it to the Most Sacred and Most Merciful Heart of Jesus. \nFurrow, 830 \n\nYes, you're right: how base your wretchedness is! By your own efforts, where would you be now, where would you have got to? \nYou admitted: \"Only a Love that was full of mercy could keep on loving me.'' \nCheer up. He will not deny you his Love or his Mercy, if you go to him. \nThe Forge, 897 \n\nhttp://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/divine-mercy\n\n\nhttp://www.escrivaworks.org/result.php?page=1&search=Confession&point=&book=all\nFr.

is located in the center of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. \nWhat does the cow mean?\nThe cow is a symbol of prosperity of Ukraine and Ukrainian people.\nOnly Ukrainians themseves at their Ukrainian land will be able to get a milk from a cow!\n\nHow could they get it?\nHow Ukrainians would become rich during the period of only one generation?\nHow would it be possible to make Ukrainians rich?\n\nGennadiy Balashov proposes to reduce taxation system in Ukraine: to introduce the system of 5.10. \nThe system 5.10 means the cancellation of OLD taxation's system in Ukraine and the introduction of a NEW system of 5% of sale's taxes, and only 10% of social taxes (=the taxes from official income or salary).\nAll other taxes, including VAT, must be cancelled.\n\nActually,  now in 2014 the salary's taxes in Ukraine = 25%.\nGennadiy Balashov considers that only this system of 5.10 will provide enormous amount of foreign investments in the economy of Ukraine.\nGennadiy Balashov claims that only peculator or dull person cannot understand this very simple taxation system.\n\nGennadiy Balashov considers that very developed system of paculators, or state Treasury embezzlers, is a real reason of embezzlement and corruption in Ukraine.\nThe corrupted economical system leads to the destruction of the state's economy and economic state of all citizens of Ukraine. \n\nKiev 2014:

This free video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this Elephants video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nElephants are spread in Africa south of the Sahara and in the south and southeast of Asia. They are the only living species of the trunk animals, extinct include the mammoths and mastodons. They are the largest living land animals. Male African elephants can a height of 4 m and a weight of 7000 kg reach. These animals have different distinguishing features, such as a proboscis or trunk which is being used for many purposes, in particular for gripping objects. Their teeth grow into fangs and serve as tools for moving objects, digging and as a weapon in combat. The big ear flaps of the elephant are used to control the temperature. Of the body African elephants have bigger ears and a concave back, while Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or straight back.\n\nFor their tusks is excessively hunted elephants. Poachers shoot elephants for the ivory of their tusks. Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Their closest relatives are the existing dugongs and hyraxes that they clade Paenungulata forming within the super-order Afrotheria. Elephants and manatees are further classified in the clade Tethytheria. Traditionally, two types of elephants recognized: the African elephant from sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian elephant from South and Southeast Asia. African elephants have larger ears, a round back, more wrinkled skin, and two finger-like ends at the tip of their trunks. The Asian elephant has smaller ears, a convex back, smoother skin and a finger-like end to the tip of the trunk. The circular ridges on the molars are narrower at the Asian elephants, while that of the African elephant are more diamond-shaped.\n\nFurthermore, there are indications that elephants in West Africa are a distinct species, but this is disputed. The dwarf elephant of the Congo Basin, which by some as a separate species, Loxodonta pumilio be considered, are likely to forest elephants, whose small size and / or early adulthood are due to environmental factors. As with other mega herbivores, including the extinct Sauropoda, probably the large size of elephants evolved so that they could survive on vegetation with a low nutritional value. Elephants retained certain characteristics of their aquatic ancestors as their middle ear anatomy and internal testes of males.\n\nElephants are among the most intelligent animals. A large number of typical behavioral patterns of elephants indicate high intelligence: grief, learn, ensuring people's boy, mimicry, art, play, humor, altruism, use of tools, compassion, self-awareness, memory and possibly language.\n\nElephants have a typical gray skin, but seeing African elephants are brown or reddish colored after wallowing in mud. Asian elephants have some depigmentatievlekken, especially on the forehead and the ears, and around the areas. Calves have brown or reddish hair, especially on the head and on the back. When elephants get older, their hair darker and thinner, but the hair on the end of the tail, chin, genitals and areas around the eyes and ear openings remains thicker. The skin of an Asian elephant normally is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.\n\nElephants have difficulty to lose through their skin because they have a low surface content ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a man. Heat There are even observed elephants lifted their feet, presumably to try to free to air. Elephants usually have 26 teeth, the incisors, which are known as the tusks, 12 premolars and 12 molars. In contrast to most mammals with milk teeth begin with and then replaced by a single fixed set of adult teeth, elephants polyphyodonte animals that have a cycle of tooth rotation have throughout their life.\n\nBaby elephant family groups are the focus of attention and are cared for by their mothers up to three years. Elephants live up to 70 years in their natural environment. Touch, sight, and hearing the way they communicate with. Over long distances, as elephants can not hear low frequency sounds of people and seismic communication path communicates with. Level of intelligence of elephants primates and whales are compared with.\n\nCreate a family group of elephants that come together from time to time may create a larger community. Reach puberty male elephants leave the family groups or alone, or in combination with other male elephants can form a group. Adult males to mate with peers when they call family groups come together.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!", "title": "Dancing Elephants of Stuttgart Zoo", "publishedDate": "2014-08-15T11:38:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "00hlFI46TJc", "description": "Externally sign respiratory problem in traditional broiler commercial farm in central java", "title": "Infectious Bronchitis IB in chicken", "publishedDate": "2012-02-25T15:41:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "00hyiErqWxk", "description": "", "title": "Bahai 84-fanat", "publishedDate": "2012-12-26T22:11:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "00iGYUHS9KQ", "description": "Metal version of a Change Gon' Come by Sabac Red.

While not included in the core definition of ADHD, a significant number of children and adults who have ADHD have difficulty regulating their emotions. \n\nTo further complicate matters, there is a significant amount of comorbidity--or, two separate disorders existing together in the same person--between ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. Around 80-90 percent of children with bipolar disorder also have ADHD. Among young people with ADHD, as many as 10-15 percent also have bipolar disorder (ADHD being the far more common of the two). \n\nHere, in an interview conducted following his Grand Rounds presentation at the NYU Langone Child Study Center on June 22, 2012, Steve V. Faraone, PhD, discusses the differences in emotionality between those with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Being able to accurate differentiate and diagnose the disorders is crucial because the courses of treatment are quite different. \n\nDr. Faraone is the director of child and adolescent psychiatry research, and the director of medical genetics research, as well as professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience and physiology at SUNY Upstate Medical University. \n\nHis Grand Rounds presentation at the NYU Langone Child Study Center was entitled \"Irritable ADHD: Deficient Emotional Self Regulation or Mania?\" Find out more about the NYU Langone Child Study Center and our Grand Rounds series at www.aboutourkids.org.", "title": "Emotional states in ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and ODD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-28T16:45:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "01-sVpBDIsw", "description": "WINDS OF PLAGUE - California (OFFICIAL VIDEO).

The original of 'The Message' is an atmospheric house track that is given a more tech house vibe by Zoo Brazil's fellow Swede Tiger Stripes. Remixer Jeff Doubleu turned the track into a electro houser, whereas the remix by Chadash Cort is full blown techno. You could say this package definitely has something for everybody.\n \nThe US Grammy and BRIT Award award nominated Zoo Brazil also know as John Andersson has been producing and writing music since an early age, and has released over 140 singles and 8 albums under such monikers as Zoo Brazil, Laid, Dead Cites, Cuba Computers, Nars, The Kelly Project, The Wiggs, Outcold and many more. Throughout his career John has steadily carved out a reputation for himself as one of dance music's most innovative and respected producers and Dj. He has seen huge success in the world of pop music having co-written Kylie Minogue's hit song \"The One\" featured on her 2007 album \"X\" and his song \"Zoo Brazil feat Rasmus - There is hope\" which during 2011 was one of the most viewed song on youtube. That same year he released his first mix compilation 'Songs for Clubs' and in 2012 he released his 'Any Moment Now' album. 'Songs For Clubs' got it's successor in 2013.\n \nRoland Clark has released well over 300 records and is on the front line of the international house music scene He has worked with Fatboy Slim, Todd Terry, Rodger S, Bob Sinclar and countless others. Besides a DJ, Roland is a vocalist with a soulful and deep voice as you can hear in this collaboration with Zoo Brazil. \n\nMagik Muzik 1091-0\nZoo Brazil featuring Roland Clark - The Message\n1.

Many peculiar things happen in BEC matter which is a superfluid with zero viscosity. This superfluidity in BEC was first detected experimentally in liquid helium near 0 K in 1930s by London brothers. BEC was predicted by Bose and Einstein in 1924 and was observed experimentally in 1996 in purest form in a controlled fashion.\n\nAmong many peculiar properties of BEC is the ability of BEC to form bright solitons when the atomic interaction is attractive. Bright solitons are robust objects whch move long distances without deformation. In frontal collision in one dimension two such BEC solitons pass through each other without deformation. The experimental set up uses a strong magnetic trap in transverse directions to confine the BEC, so that a quasi-one-dimensional configuration is achieved where the BEC can move freely in the axial direction. In such a set up, if the atomic interaction is attractive, a droplet of BEC of a small number of atoms form a bright soliton.\n\nHowever, many bosonic atoms have (electric or magnetic) dipole moment, which changes the above scenario dramatically. Because of peculiar properties of dipolar interaction, strange things can happen. In the cigar-shaped configuration the dipolar interaction leads to attraction, as many dipoles placed on a linear chain attract each other. Consequently, a cigar-shaped dipolar BEC could be attractive even for a finite repulsive atomic interaction.\n\nIf these solitons are rotating around their axis, they form a vortex soliton with a hole (vortex core) along their axis. This special kind of soliton  is termed vortex soliton. We have studied the dynamics of vortex solitons formed in cigar-shaped dipolar BEC with repulsive atomic interactions.\n\nIf two vortex solitons  collide frontally with a large relative velocity,  they move towards each other and pass through each other unchanged. However, if two such vortex solitons are placed side-by-side, they move towards each other due to atomic interaction and form a soliton molecule  -- a bound state of two solitons -- and never come out as individual solitons. \n\nWe used the solution of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation for this theoretical investigation using two cigar-shaped vortex solitons, each of 1000 Dysprosium atoms, with a permanent dipole moment and with a repulsive atomic interaction. Two BEC vortex solitons  placed side-by side with an initial distance of about 50 microns slowly move towards each other and combine to form a soliton molecule and oscillate for ever without allowing the individual solitons to come out.\n\nAuthors: L.

A diferencia de la psoriasis en otras partes del cuerpo, este tipo de la psoriasis es dif\u00edcil de cubrir. Se puede propagar a los alrededores del cuello, la frente y las orejas. No s\u00f3lo es inc\u00f3modo y con comez\u00f3n, pero puede ser una fuente de ansiedad para los enfermos de psoriasis as\u00ed.\n\nHay muchos tratamientos m\u00e9dicos convencionales para la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo. Cada paciente de psoriasis puede reaccionar de manera diferente a diversos tratamientos. Los tratamientos m\u00e9dicos para el rango de la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo de ung\u00fcentos t\u00f3picos a las drogas en todo el cuerpo sist\u00e9micos. Actualmente no existe cura para la psoriasis receta y los tratamientos convencionales pueden tener efectos secundarios no deseados. Por lo tanto, m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s personas est\u00e1n optando por remedios psoriasis naturales que son seguros y efectivos. \u00c9stos son algunos de los m\u00e9todos m\u00e1s populares para el tratamiento de la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo, naturalmente.\n\nTratamiento natural para la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo # 1: aceites de masaje en el cuero cabelludo\n\nLos parches en el cuero cabelludo tiende a ser muy gruesa y escamosa a fin de utilizar una crema espesa o aceites de masaje suavemente en las \u00e1reas afectadas. C\u00fabrase la zona del cuero cabelludo con papel pl\u00e1stico y deje que los aceites en remojo durante al menos 30 minutos antes de enjuagar. El aceite de oliva es una opci\u00f3n popular para los masajes del cuero cabelludo y empapa. Si usted no tiene el aceite de oliva, las otras cremas o aceites que son emoliente funcionar\u00e1 tan bien.\n\nTratamiento natural para la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo # 2: Obtener una dosis diaria de omega-3 los \u00e1cidos grasos\n\nOmega-3 los \u00e1cidos grasos reducen la inflamaci\u00f3n en el cuerpo, lo que puede ayudar en gran medida a la psoriasis. Aseg\u00farese de que est\u00e1 recibiendo su dosis diaria de omega-3 de fuentes frescas o en forma de suplementos. A\u00f1adir un mont\u00f3n de semillas de lino, nueces, salm\u00f3n, y la soja a su dieta. Tomar aceite de pescado y los suplementos de semillas de lino tambi\u00e9n pueden ayudar, pero son generalmente menos efectivos que nuevas fuentes de \u00e1cidos grasos omega-3.\n\nTratamiento natural para la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo # 3: Reducir el consumo de az\u00facar\n\nEl az\u00facar no es necesariamente malo para el cuerpo, pero la dieta moderna contiene demasiado az\u00facar. Nuestros cuerpos anhelan az\u00facar porque nuestros antepasados \u200b\u200bs\u00f3lo pudieron obtener en peque\u00f1as cantidades, pero el exceso de az\u00facar puede ser altamente inflamatoria y contribuir a un sistema inmunol\u00f3gico hiperactivo. Reduzca su consumo de az\u00facar y puede ser m\u00e1s eficaz que cualquier otro tratamiento de la psoriasis del cuero cabelludo que hay. Tambi\u00e9n se mantenga alejado de los az\u00facares artificiales como el aspartame, ya que pueden agravar los s\u00edntomas de la psoriasis. Mantenga sus antojos de az\u00facar bajo control con una porci\u00f3n de fruta en su lugar.\n\nEstos son s\u00f3lo algunos de los remedios psoriasis naturales que han funcionado para muchos enfermos, pero pueden no ser eficaces para todos. Se necesita tiempo y esfuerzo para encontrar un remedio psoriasis natural que funciona para usted personalmente.\n\npsoriasis cura\npsoriasis tratamiento\ntratamiento natural para la psoriasis\ntratamiento psoriasis\nremedios caseros para el acne\ntratamiento para la psoriasis\npsoriasis en la piel\npsoriasis cuero cabelludo\npsoriasis sintomas\npsoriasis tratamiento natural\ntratamientos naturales para la psoriasis\npsoriasis nerviosa\nremedios caseros para psoriasis\npsoriasis remedios naturales\npsoariasis\ntratamiento para psoriasis\ncomo curar la psoriasis\nremedios para la psoriasis\ntratamientos para la psoriasis\npsoriasis en gotas\nremedio casero para la psoriasis", "title": "COMO ELIMINAR LA PSORIASIS EN EL CUERO CABELLUDO RAPIDAMENTE!!!", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T22:23:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "01D0yYF7Bac", "description": "again messing around with tattoo's\n\ni am cherryblossomlover on ovipet", "title": "macropus tattoo", "publishedDate": "2013-01-28T05:45:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "01D4U6wqkl0", "description": "detta \u00e4r sveriges snyggaste h\u00e5r.\nBild nr 1 ;bdb@ F-edwards. bild nr 2 bdb@ krillebooi.

The thing to remember is that there is no edge. Right? Because if we're knitting in the round, there's no right edge or left edge to have to balance decreases on. But there are a few different ways of doing decreases, and this is all pattern-dependent and garment-dependent. So I'll show you a few different ways of arranging your decreases. \n\nThis is a hat that I knit in the round on a 60-inch circular. So, I knit around and around with a knit two, pearl two ribbing, and then I knit a long section of straight stockinette. And when I got to the top, it was time to start decreasing evenly in my round. So, I took the number of stitches that I had around, divided it by whatever number seemed to fit evenly into there, and I just did a decrease every inch or do . . . or that looks like every half inch or so. And that made even decreases around the top. And that's to bring together things in sort of concentric circles the size of your rounds. \n\nYou can also stack them and make them directional, like the top of this mitten. This has left-leaning decreases on one side that are stacked up every other round. And this has right-leaning decreases on this side that are stacked up every other round. And that makes a directional decrease that's repeated on this side of the mitten, left-leaning decreases and right-leaning decreases. And you actually don't work the decreases any differently than you would on straight needles, except, remember, that there's no beginning or end of the sides of your project here. You just have a round that goes around and around.\n\nSo, I'll show you my favorite ways of decreasing. This is my favorite right-leaning decrease. I'll do a couple of them. This is knit two together, and that makes the stitches on the left eat the ones on the right, so it kind of leans to the right. \n\nAnd then there's a few different ways of working a leaf-leaning decrease. One is a slip, slip, knit. So I'm going to slip a stitch as if to knit; slip a stitch as if to pearl, and then I'm going to knit them through the back loop. This makes a left-leaning decrease where the stitch on the right is eating the stitch on the left; therefore, it leans to the left. \n\nAnd then you can also just knit two together through the back loop, which does the same thing but gives you a slightly different look. Here you can see that the stitch that sits on top is crossed at the bottom, as opposed to slip, slip, knit, where it's open at the bottom. \n\nAnd if you'd like to see exactly how to do those decreases, they are in another video on right-leaning decreases and left-leaning decreases. But you don't have to work them any differently when you're in the round than you do when you're knitting flat.", "title": "How to Decrease on Circular Needles | Circular Knitting", "publishedDate": "2013-11-29T19:57:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "01RRPs7UXes", "description": "This video shows you how to make simple and delicious vegan jalape\u00f1o poppers.

Now this newly leaked track titled 'Heart Wants What It Wants' is produced by Rock Mafia, and it HAS to be about Justin!\n\nHer greatest hits album is pegged for release on November 24th and lucky for us, the tracklist was also recently released! It's missing her iconic anthems including Hit The Lights and Bang Bang Bang... but includes two (possibly three new tracks).  In addition to 'Heart Wants What it Wants there's also 'Do It\" and 'Mas' - but this could be a spanish version of another song that's already released.\n\nAlright guys, so what do you think of Selena's new song? There is a chance that the leaked version of the song is not legit, which is what Rock Mafia is claiming, so maybe the official release will sound quite different.  But based upon the information we have thus far, how do you feel about this track?", "title": "Selena Gomez New Song 'Heart Wants What It Wants' (LEAKED)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T00:17:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "01YW5EnkAJA", "description": "BEST VINES: http://www.hiviral.com/vines/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VineHeaven\nVineProject: https://www.youtube.com/user/VineProject\n\nThe life of Juan, Mom is making refried beans\nThe life of Juan, Mom is making refried beans\nThe life of Juan, Mom is making refried beans\n\nVine By - David Lopez\n\nEMAIL heavenvine@gmail.com TO ADDRESS ANY COPYRIGHT & CREDIT ISSUES.\n\nSubscribe & Support us!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=VineHeaven\n\nWant your vine uploaded ?

What should not be forgotten is that the Macedonians stood on the side of anti-fascist fight and gave numerous victims for expulsion of fascist occupier. Thanks to such fight the People`s Republic of Macedonia was established in the frames of Yugoslavia, which included only Macedonians that live in the borders of today`s Republic of Macedonia, Gruevski said.\n He said that the destiny of the Macedonian refugees after the civil war in Greece was treated in many books,  films and theatre plays and as of today also in the permanent exhibition in the Museum of Macedonia.\n History sometimes can be significantly painful and tragic, but it must NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. One can be deprived from childhood, house to be tore down, village to be set on fire, but human memory cannot be destroyed. Such memory connected with a painful and difficult history of some of our nation can be supported today with this museum`s display, Gruevski said.\nhttp://www.mia.mk/en/Inside/RenderSingleNews/92/132343386\n\n http://kanal5.com.mk/vesti_detail.asp?ID=52076\n\nhttp://kurir.mk/makedonija/vesti/176153-Nova-muzejska-postavka-posvetena-na-Makedoncite-begalci", "title": "New permanent exhibition on Macedonian refugees in WWII and civil war in Greece", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T15:44:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "01exozELu98", "description": "Orlando Carneiro fala sobre a utilidade do Nim Indiano e mostra o exempla do seu projeto ambiental.", "title": "Nim Indiano (Azadirachta indica) do Bosque Sonho do Carneiro", "publishedDate": "2012-01-25T01:11:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "01fKp-nf4AA", "description": "Rate & Comment ! \u2122 \u0090\u0090\u25c43\n\nExtra Tags :stevchenko warrock WarRock war rock ownage own pwnage pwm montage sniper assault medic pro progamer skill skiller l2p nub noob low topsc0rer stev shevchenko gamersfirst k2 network clan clanwar rebel rockers esl f2p pwn ownz pwnz fraps hypercam xfire free to play schalke s04 lol rofl funny nublike unskilled wow wuhu silvester o0 k\u00e4sekuchen mr toast Warrock Montage Gameplay Ownage gamersfirst pwnage own g1-admin owned video no scope clansystem mp5 k1 medicboxen skill skiller nub noob Play sackfalt3 sc4l4nged xpr0x3 xhessex Khali Marien Khyber Owned Pwnage Xauen Bloc powerlevlers highlevel lvl up progamer online shooter clan clanwars esl f2p fraps SonyVegas k2 network premium aimbott hacker ownage Fat.Fighters fps warfare glitch runescape stadtfalke warrock progamer warrock pro progamer warrock hacks vip hacks skiller high level warrock ownage warrock legende counterstrike pro css pro warrock skiller warrock bugs pro warrock gameplay warrock montage warrock frag ownage warrock hawler stadtfalke gameplay gameplay jubasniiper juba jubasniper sniper Iraker lraker iraker * counterstrike * k2admin * Eminem * Rihanna * Love * The * Way * You * Lie * Official * Music * Video * Spoof * Song * Lyrics * Parody * Vevo * Style * WarRock * Nederland * WarRock.NL * War * Rock * Event * Bokkie * Thommiej * Rapsniperr * Zerocoke * Aerologic * Fection * The1terror * K2 * Network * G1 * Gamersfirst * G1-Admin-Jericho * G1-Admin-Stavros * G1-Sasrine * G1-Admin-Kronos * G1-Admin-Gryphius * G1-Admin-Keti * G1-Admin-Roger * G1-Admin-Phoebe * G1-Admin-Artemis * G1Silentk * G1-Admin-Crystal * G1-Admin-Neo * LevelArtist * G1Neume * G1-Admin-Maximus * G1-Admin-Korgoth * G1-Calosoma * G1Nemico * G1Silent * G1-Admin-Carbon * G1-Admin-Quantum * G1-Admin-Rage * linkin park * Breaking Benjamin *kill * xpr0turk * vivarazer * Marien * g1-admin-rage * Bushido * Fackeln * im * Wind * Scub4r * xiiMeniix * xmenx * 0xmarcx0 * ist * cool * scubnubs * Bann * Call * of * duty * counter * strike * WarRock * International * Korea * Japan * PSG * PSG-1 * PSG-1_SW * SW * Red * Edition * network * action * wr * Rot * Rote * gm * credits * ownage * hq * RPG-7 * RPG_7 * War * Rock * Weltmeister * Dotonbori * Dragunov * glitch * montage * hacks * gaming * computers * fps * warfare * modren warfare * stevchenko * warrock * WarRock * war * rock * ownage * own * pwnage *", "title": "Dnns goes lan  [Promo]", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T12:57:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "01fixa4lgcE", "description": "Part 10", "title": "X-Ray Spex - Germ Free Adolescents", "publishedDate": "2009-07-08T23:51:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "01g1Pj7mIGQ", "description": "US brutal death metal\nFrom ''Graveyard Fornication'' full-length (2005)", "title": "Disinterment - Panty Strangler", "publishedDate": "2011-09-09T23:07:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "01h1zAQGNRw", "description": "The worlds best alarm clock for sale at ebay", "title": "The worlds best christmas gift by nickelodeon an alarm clock", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T00:33:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "01hJucnwKIg", "description": "From the video assignment night with the Youth Group.

Se localiza en la planta del pie abarcando desde el tal\u00f3n hasta las cabezas de los metatarsianos y tiene una enorme capacidad de resistencia.\n\nLa sobrecarga repetida provoca una tracci\u00f3n en las fibras de inserci\u00f3n de la fascia plantar cerca del tal\u00f3n lo que provoca dolor. Esta tracci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n puede provocar rotura de algunas fibras de la fascia. El dolor, con frecuencia, es atribuido al espol\u00f3n calc\u00e1neo que no suele ser su causante.\n\nEl dolor se percibe en la cercan\u00eda del tal\u00f3n y puede irradiar a lo largo de la parte externa de la planta del pie.\n\nEl dolor aumenta cuando se est\u00e1 de puntillas o se camina sobre el tal\u00f3n. En las fases iniciales cede con el reposo, pero cuando el problema est\u00e1 m\u00e1s evolucionado puede persistir en reposo y, adem\u00e1s, puede haber rigidez y cojera matutina.\n\nPREVENCI\u00d3N \n\nEs necesario utilizar plantillas que corrijan los defectos anat\u00f3micos como pie cavo o tobillo pronado, y utilizar calzado que proporcione un apoyo suficiente del arco plantar.\n\nEl estiramiento del arco plantar es una medida de cierta utilidad. Tambi\u00e9n es necesario evitar el trote prolongado sobre superficies duras.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, el sobrepeso y la obesidad son factores que tienen una importante participaci\u00f3n en la g\u00e9nesis de la fascitis plantar, por lo que deben ser corregidas.\n\nTRATAMIENTO \n\nEl reposo relativo, el fr\u00edo y la medicaci\u00f3n antiinflamatoria por v\u00eda general y t\u00f3pica son las medidas iniciales de tratamiento.\n\nEs muy recomendable la utilizaci\u00f3n de un vendaje funcional de descarga y el uso de plantillas ortop\u00e9dicas adecuadas.\n\nUna vez superada la fase de dolor m\u00e1s intenso es \u00fatil la realizaci\u00f3n de estiramientos plantares.\n\nPuedes ver mas detalles en:\nwww.nohaydolor.com\n\nALMIRALL \nwww.almirall.com", "title": "FASCITIS PLANTAR (\u00c1MBITO DEL DEPORTE) - www.nohaydolor.com - ALMIRALL", "publishedDate": "2010-06-09T11:40:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "01u87Jaemrc", "description": "Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia Mydas) \n\n* Family: Cheloniidae, \n\n* Genus: Chelonia, \n\n* Species: C. mydas, \n\n* Class: Reptilia, \n\n* Phylum: Chordata,\n\n* Order: Testudines\n\n* Type: Reptile, \n\n* Diet: Herbivore, \n\n* Average life span in the wild: Over 80 years, \n\n* Size: Up to 5 ft (1.5 m), \n\n* Weight: Up to 700 lbs (317.5 kg), \n\n* Group name: Bale, \n\n* Protection status:Endangered. \n\n** Did you know?

I felt that standing up would provoke him more and leave me more vulnerable to goring.\n\"I think that while protecting myself with my head down, having my head down was a signal that I was rutting with him.\n\"I was concerned at first, but when he started rearing back and lunging at me later on, I got scared and p----- off. That's when I wagged my finger at him to cut that s--- out.\n\"I was relieved to see the Ranger coming.

Here are some simple ways to bring your temperature down without medicine.\n\n\nStep 1: Get lots of rest\nYour body is running a high temperature because of an infection, so get plenty of rest. This lets your body concentrate fully on fighting the infection.\n\nStep 2: Drink lots of fluids\nDrinking a lot of water \u2013 10 8-ounce glasses a day at least when you're sick \u2013 keeps your body hydrated, and will also lower your internal temperature.\n\nStep 3: Take a lukewarm bath\nTake a nice lukewarm bath. Not too hot, which could escalate the fever, and not too cold, which could shock your system. This will lower your skin temperature gradually.\n\nTip\nAvoid cooling off the body too quickly, or you won't rid yourself of the infection your body is fighting.\n\nStep 4: Cool washcloths\nPlace cool \u2013 not cold \u2013 washcloths on the wrists, under the arm, on the forehead, and over the groin. Using cool, damp rags over these four key areas will slowly cool the body.\n\nStep 5: Put damp socks on your feet\nWhile you're putting cool rags over various body parts, put a pair of cool, damp socks on your feet, with a dry pair over the top. This lets your ankles cool while still allowing you to walk around.\n\nStep 6: Keep the home a moderate temperature\nEven though a person running a fever may feel cold, do not overheat the home. Instead, keep the house at a moderate temperature of 70 to 74 degrees.\n\nStep 7: Don't wear heavy clothing\nA person running a fever should not wear heavy clothes or wrap themselves in heavy blankets. Doing so makes it difficult for the body to shed extra heat; instead, wear light clothing.\n\nStep 8: Monitor the fever\nIf these remedies don't work and a baby less than 3 months old is running a temperature of more than 101 degrees, or a child or adult's temperature is over 103 degrees, see a doctor.\n\nDid You Know?\nFever is also known as Pyrexia, which comes from the Greek word meaning fire.", "title": "How to Reduce a Fever Naturally", "publishedDate": "2009-07-27T15:06:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "01zyRZohmpM", "description": "", "title": "A look inside Atlas Coal Mountain Wooden Tipple", "publishedDate": "2014-02-25T19:16:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "02-MFse248U", "description": "volando sobre lago Gutierrez, con cerro Catedral sur detr\u00e1s", "title": "C\u00f3ndor, desde el cerro Meta, Bariloche", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T16:28:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "020MdntTw34", "description": "Pro-Line cleaner for diesel particle filters is a highly effective agent for the costsaving cleaning of installed diesel particle filters on commercial motor vehicles.

Name: Amaryllis / Hippeastrum\nFamilie: Amaryllidaceae\nWuchsh\u00f6he: 50 bis 80 cm\nVerwendung: Bl\u00fctenschmuckpflanze\nBl\u00fctezeit: August bis April\nSchwierigkeit: pflegeleicht bis mittelschwer\n\npflegeleicht: F\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger geeignet\nmittelschwer: Erfahrung und durchschnittliche Pflegekenntnisse erforderlich\nanspruchsvoll: Gute Grundkenntnisse der Zimmerpflanzenpflege sind zu empfehlen, diese k\u00f6nnen Sie hier nachlesen: Der gr\u00fcne Daumen\n\nBei der Gattung Amaryllis handelt es sich um eine Zwiebelpflanze. Im Handel findet man h\u00e4ufig die Zwiebeln des Amaryllis, seltener bereits ausgetriebene Pflanzen. Von den urspr\u00fcnglichen Arten sind leider nur wenige erh\u00e4ltlich, denn die G\u00e4rtnereien haben sich auf die Zucht zahlreicher Hybriden verlegt. Zu diesen Hybriden geh\u00f6ren zahlreiche Sorten, die wegen eines bestimmten Merkmals zur Vermehrung ausgew\u00e4hlt, benannt und aus Brutzwiebeln nachgezogen werden, sowie namenlose S\u00e4mlinge, die man nach ihrer Farbe verkauft.\n\nBl\u00fctenbildung in den Wintermonaten\nDie Bl\u00fcten der Amaryllis bilden sich meist im Winter oder im zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr. Sie sind trichterf\u00f6rmig, haben weit herausragende Staubgef\u00e4\u00dfe, und die Farbskala dieser Bl\u00fcten reicht von Wei\u00df bis zu verschiedenen T\u00f6nen von Rot, Orangerot oder - seltener anzutreffen - Gelb.\n\nBl\u00fcten einfarbig oder gezeichnet\nEinige Sorten bilden nahezu einfarbige Bl\u00fcten, andere wiederum weisen Randzeichnungen, Streifenmuster oder Flecken in verschiedenen Farben und T\u00f6nungen auf. Alle Bl\u00fcten der Amaryllis haben aber etwas gemeinsam, sind sehr attraktiv und wundersch\u00f6n anzusehen.\n\nUnterschiedliche Zeiten der Bl\u00e4tterbildung\nDie Bl\u00e4tter einer Amaryllis bilden sich im zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr nach der Bl\u00fcte, bei einigen Sorten jedoch bereits im sp\u00e4ten Winter, vor dem Wachstum der Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte. Die Bl\u00e4tter entspringen der Zwiebel, sind mittelgr\u00fcn, riemenf\u00f6rmig und erreichen eine L\u00e4nge von bis zu 45 cm. Ein dicker, im Inneren hohler Bl\u00fctenschaft, der wie die Bl\u00e4tter eine L\u00e4nge von etwa 45 cm erreicht, wird meist zum zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr hin seitlich an der Zwiebel einer Amaryllis ausgebildet.\n\nGro\u00dfe Zwiebeln - gro\u00dfe Bl\u00fcten\nGro\u00dfe, gesunde Amaryllis Zwiebeln mit einem Durchmesser ab etwa 10 cm k\u00f6nnen zwei Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte bilden, die jeweils aufeinander folgen. Jeder Bl\u00fctenschaft tr\u00e4gt \u00fcblicherweise 4 Bl\u00fcten, und bei besonders kr\u00e4ftigen Exemplaren erreicht jede Bl\u00fcte einen Durchmesser von 15 bis 20 cm. Die einzelnen Bl\u00fcten einer Amaryllis halten etwa zwei bis drei Wochen, bevor sie verbl\u00fchen.\nPflege der Amaryllis / Kulturanleitung\nLicht / Standort\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Hauptwachstumszeit ben\u00f6tigen die Amaryllis einen m\u00f6glichst hellen Standort, direktes Sonnenlicht ist f\u00fcr die Entwicklung der Amaryllis sehr f\u00f6rderlich. Bei zu schwachen Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen w\u00e4hrend der Wachstumszeit werden die Bl\u00e4tter der Amaryllis \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig lang und im darauffolgenden Jahr werden keine Bl\u00fcten ausgebildet. Ein heller und sonniger Standplatz von der Zeit nach der Bl\u00fcte bis Mitte Herbst hat auf die n\u00e4chste Bl\u00fcte einen sehr gro\u00dfen und sehr g\u00fcnstigen Einfluss. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit sind die Lichtverh\u00e4ltnisse nicht von Bedeutung.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nFrisch eingetopfte Amaryllis Zwiebeln werden bis zur Ausbildung der Wurzeln, die durch einen gesunden, frischen Austrieb anzeigt wird, nur m\u00e4\u00dfig feucht gehalten. Nach dem Austrieb w\u00e4ssert man die Amaryllis etwas kr\u00e4ftiger, die Pflanze ben\u00f6tigt nun mehr Feuchtigkeit. Trotzdem l\u00e4sst man vor der jeweils n\u00e4chsten W\u00e4sserung die Erde leicht antrocknen.\n\nWenn die Amaryllis dann vollw\u00fcchsig ist, h\u00e4lt man die Erde durch reichlicheres W\u00e4ssern st\u00e4ndig feucht. Zum Ende der Hauptwachstumszeit kann man zwar noch eine Zeitlang etwas gie\u00dfen, ab Mitte Herbst sollte man das W\u00e4ssern aber einstellen, um die Zwiebeln der Amaryllis zur Winterruhe zu zwingen.\n\nSobald die Pflanze nicht mehr gew\u00e4ssert wird, vergilben und verwelken die Bl\u00e4tter. Gie\u00dft man zu lange, bleibt das Laub gr\u00fcn und w\u00e4chst st\u00e4ndig weiter. W\u00e4hrend der Ruhezeit, die bis zum Austriebsbeginn der Zwiebeln dauert, wir die Erde vollst\u00e4ndig trocken gehalten.", "title": "Amaryllis", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T18:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "02GslNNJbc4", "description": "Super Bunnyhop is here with your Supergiant Games Lore! http://bit.ly/MoarLore\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/loreinaminute\nWritten by Clara\nVoiced by Super Bunnyhop:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/bunnyhopshow\nAnimated by Jeremey:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TerminalMontage\n\nTranscript:\n\nIn 2009, Amir Rao and Gavin Simon left their cushy jobs at EA to pursue their dream of creating a game they were passionate about without being crippled by the miles of red tape that came with large studios. The two established Supergiant Games and set up their new office in San Jose, California in the living room of Amir's Dad's house. Despite having been advised not to start a company with friends, they formed a staff of seven by calling up old roommates and childhood pals including New York-based composer Darren Korb.\n\nTheir first game was self-funded, so both the company's future and their bank accounts depended upon the reception of Bastion. In 2011, Bastion was distributed by Warner Brothers and earned awards including Best Downloadable Game, and Best Debut Award for Supergiant Games. In response to fan demand, Supergiant Games also released a full award-winning soundtrack album. With the success of Bastion, Supergiant Games moved out of the living room into an office in San Francisco, expanded their staff to twelve, and delighted fans by setting their sights on a new project: Transistor.

They would never do that in Zimbabwe, because they still want their estates back. \n\nFor instance, you will not hear that the Zimbabwean government imported and distributed thousands of tractors and farm implements over the last few years. \n\nhttp://maravi.blogspot.com/2008/04/farm-mechanisation-gets-another-boost.html\n\n(HERALD) Farm mechanisation gets another boost \n\nFarm mechanisation gets another boost\nBy Tabitha Mutenga\n\nGOVERNMENT has acquired more state-of-the-art farming equipment from China for distribution to farmers under the Farm Mechanisation Programme. The equipment includes tractors, seed drills, roam disc harrows, combine harvesters and irrigation equipment.\n\nIn an interview yesterday, the Minister of Agricultural Engineering, Mechanisation and Irrigation, Dr Joseph Made, said mechanisation was an ongoing programme meant to ensure maximum production and food security in line with the gains of the Land Reform Programme.\n\n\"We are grateful to our Chinese colleagues as the consignment of machinery and equipment is now in the country and being assembled to complement the previous mechanisation phases and prepare for the next phase.\n\n\"We have received 2 000 precise seed drilling planters and another 2 000 roam disc harrows for land preparations,\" Dr Made said.\n\nThe Government continues to order related farming machinery from China for land preparation, planting and harvesting.\n\nThe seed drills are used for planting wheat, soyabean, sorghum and other small grains.\n\n\"These implements came at the right time as the country is preparing for the winter season. We need this precise, matching and appropriate equipment as it is critical in achieving high yields,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the machinery needs the right fertilizers and the correct formulations of fertilizer to achieve the necessary yields.\n\nThe minister stressed that care had been taken to ensure that the machinerys design amd specifications were compatible with Zimbabwean conditions.\n\nGovernment will continue to receive assorted equipment from Europe, the Middle East and Far East for the tractors that are already in the country to operate holistically.\n\nBesides machinery for land preparations, Government has also received 2 000 tractors and 175 combine harvesters. This is in addition to thousands of other pieces of machinery so far distributed to farmers countrywide under phases one, two and currently three.\n\n\"This only proves the magnitude of the mechanisation programme, which came through meticulous planning by the Government, the central bank and the suppliers.\"\n\nSince the main focus of the mechanisation programme is to modernise agriculture, communal and small-scale farmers would receive smaller tractors and implements.\n\n\"The resolution of the ministry, therefore, comes to a full circle to capacitate farmers with the necessary machinery.\"\n\nThe irrigation equipment from China and Iran was now in place and the Department of Irrigation was working around the clock to rehabilitate the irrigation infrastructure in the country.\n\nThe pumps received would enable the Government to resuscitate flood irrigation, as the system is suitable for small farmers because it is cheap and does not need much electricity as it uses canals.\n\n\"The system is very effective from an energy cost point and it will enable us to resuscitate the small irrigation schemes in the country,\" Dr Made said.\n\n\"Training and retraining of users of the equipment will be sponsored by Fiscorp, a subsidiary of the RBZ, Ministry of Mechanisation and the private sector with the help of suppliers of various machinery.\n\n\"Training is critical in building up the capacity of the farmers to repair and maintain equipment,\" Dr Made said.\n\nThe ministry would also contract local companies to manufacture tractor trailers for tractors that were distributed without the trailers.\n\n\"Companies should, therefore, gear themselves for this task, but the cost quotations should be reasonable.\"\n\nDr Made appealed to all agricultural extension officers to remain focused and work towards the goal of achieving maximum production.\n\n\"Farmers should be trained on calibration and the building of infrastructure to store the machinery, repeated training and demonstration exercises on how to use the equipment will definitely give us the returns that we hope to achieve,\" he said.\n\nDr Made said the just-ended Zimbabwe International Trade Fair had also brought up some suppliers with Brazilian links and that soon machinery and equipment from that country would feature in \"our mechanisation programme.", "title": "Land Reform In Venezuela (Al-Jazeera, 2009)", "publishedDate": "2010-05-09T01:24:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "02JORChmwgs", "description": "", "title": "photohabach salle des f\u00eate -SHERATON-", "publishedDate": "2012-02-18T10:45:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "02JQnzE6z40", "description": "", "title": "Don Felix - I've got it (1995)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-04T10:05:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "02JiEO3mZNg", "description": "Live at EastVillageRadio\n\nhttp://www.kingcreosote.com/\n\nhttp://www.dominorecordco.com/artists/king-creosote/", "title": "King Creosote - Homeboy", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T22:03:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "02JlnqUhXeU", "description": "Sensory Processing Disorder is a neurological condition that causes some children to be overly seeking or overly sensitive to touch, sounds, tastes, smells, movement, and/or visual stimuli.

Luckily we have  gorgeous plants for your fall color. The Winterberry holly, or Ilex verticillata if you like botanical names.  There are several varieties, but some of the more commonly seen winterberry hollies in the northeast  areas are:\n'Winter Red' -- a prolific berry producer that grows to 6 to 8 feet\n'Red Sprite' -- a dwarf variety that stays to around 2 to 4 feet\n\n\n\n\nWinterberry occurs naturally in swamps, roadside ditches, and other poorly drained areas, often growing with the entire root system submerged for most of the year. This makes Winterberry a good choice for planting in poorly drained areas of the landscape. It also grows well in ordinary garden soil, but best growth and fruiting occurs when the plants do not experience drought.\n\nDeer seldom damage winterberry hollies. In general, damage from browsing is most severe when snow cover or extreme cold has reduced food availability. Another problem time is early spring when young succulent growth of ornamentals provides attractive browse before other spring growth is avialable. When food is in short suply, deer will browse even the most undesirable plants.\nCon il comming di cadere una fiammata iniziale di colore come il agrifogli turno, seguito da un bel po 'di rossi abd bronzo fogliame. Per fortuna abbiamo un impianto splendido per il vostro colore di caduta. Il Ilex, o Ilex verticillata, se volete nomi botanici. Ci sono diverse variet\u00e0, ma alcuni degli agrifogli WINTERBERRY pi\u00f9 comunemente visto nella zona metropolitana di DC sono:\n\u2022 'Red Winter' - un produttore prolifico bacca che cresce di 6 a 8 metri\n\u2022 'Red Sprite' - una variet\u00e0 nana che rimane a circa 2-4 metri\n\u2022 'Apollo' - un impollinatore maschio che si blocca a circa 8 metri. Non si pu\u00f2 avere frutti di bosco senza una pianta ragazzo. Yay, la natura!\n\n\n\nWinterberry si verifica naturalmente nelle paludi, fossati lungo la strada, e altre aree scarsamente drenati, spesso in crescita con l'intero sistema di radici sommerse per la maggior parte dell'anno. Questo rende Winterberry una buona scelta per l'impianto in zone poco drenati del paesaggio. Cresce bene anche nel terreno del giardino comune, ma meglio la crescita e la fruttificazione avviene quando le piante non si verificano siccit\u00e0.\n\nDerr raramente danneggia WINTERBERRY agrifogli. In generale, i danni da navigazione \u00e8 pi\u00f9 grave quando il manto nevoso o freddo estremo ha ridotto la disponibilit\u00e0 di cibo. Un altro problema \u00e8 il tempo all'inizio della primavera, quando giovane crescita succulenta di piante ornamentali fornisce attraente browse prima di altri la crescita primaverile \u00e8 avialable.

All of the selected varieties (purple-leaf, cut-leaf, weeping, etc.) come from the European side of the family, which is the Beech family, Fagaceae, with nine or ten genera, including the Oaks (Quercus) and the Chestnuts (Castanea) included within. Fagus is the Latin name for the European Beech tree, and the species name refers to the dense woodlands that this tree is a part of in Europe. In fact, the Beech is associated with climax vegetation in both Europe and the Americas.\n\nBeech trees are slow to medium growers, with perhaps a foot a year as a youngster to much slower\ngrowth as they age. Because of this fact the European Beech is one tree which I would consider planting as a larger specimen, and also because their root systems are fibrous and spread out, instead of having a taproot like a White Oak. This means that in the transplanting process, it is more likely that the small surface-oriented feeder roots would be included in the root ball and that no disturbance of the sensitive taproot would occur. I have helped transplant a forty foot European Beech, in which we dug a two foot trench around a twenty foot diameter root ball, barrel wrapped it in burlap using baling twine, and pulled it out of the hole using a metal traffic plate on the bottom, an inclined plane and a backhoe. What fun.\n\nEuropean Beech trees will grow to one hundred feet, but often mature and top out at around sixty,\nwith a spread of two-thirds the height. The habit is a low-branching rounded mound. The low-branching habit makes it such a wonderful tree to climb, with convenient hand- and footholds starting at the bottom and often spaced conveniently for the human body to clamber up its structure.\n\nPlanting a Beech is a gift to the next generation, however it's done. When we removed two large Copper Beeches here at the garden for safety reasons, I planted two small ones in the same area. They are doing well, but they won't replace those older trees until long after I'm gone. That is the just the nature of tree planting. If you are planting a Beech, chose a sunny spot (although they will tolerate some shade, they do best in full sun) in well-drained soil with reasonable fertility. Although not as finicky as the American Beech, the European Beech will fare much better with good soil.\n\nThat fibrous and shallow root system I mentioned is also an issue when it comes to planting or managing a property with a mature Beech. These trees are very sensitive to ... read more at http://www.gardenclips.com/2012/03/21/european-beech/#more-165", "title": "Purple Leaf European Beech - Fagus sylvatica atropurpurea", "publishedDate": "2012-03-28T18:12:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "02OUinjL2MI", "description": "Monopoly and Profit Maximization", "title": "Monopoly and Profit Maximization", "publishedDate": "2012-08-16T14:06:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "02Ow8N01Mto", "description": "we provide women with compassionate, research-based care at every stage of life\u2014from adolescence to menopause and beyond.

The child will wake out of sleep, often soon after going to sleep or soon before it's time to get up, with this horrible gurgling, guttural noise, drooling, being disoriented.\n\nSpeaker 2: So benign rolandic epilepsy is a syndrome. It's how it presents clinically and what the EEG looks like. The seizure starts in one area of the brain and spreads so when I look at the EEG I can see it. It has a special, funny look on the EEG that tells me it's benign rolandic. But, as you mentioned, these typically happen out of sleep, early in the morning, scare the daylights out of the parents with that gurgling sound.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. We call that the semiology of the seizure. They very commonly present in the same way. They can be treated very easily. We decide about whether or not to treat them with medication based on what the EEG findings are. How often there's abnormalities on the EEG, whether the child is doing poorly in school, and, of course, how many seizures they have as well as how old the child is.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's so interesting is that a lot of these kids are triggered by sleep deprivation. The parents don't get them to bed early, they're up really late, they are overtired, and that's when the seizures come out. Many of these kids we don't have to treat with medication because if they get sleep, they're perfectly fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just make sure they get enough sleep. The problem with that is a lot of these kids end up being restricted from sleepovers where they're staying up until 2:00 in the morning. Parents who have weddings and the kids are up late, they feel like they can't take their children to the wedding. So they miss out on some social opportunities.\n\nThere is also an incidence, bigger than what we thought, we describe it as benign rolandic epilepsy, but actually the latest literature and the latest research shows that it may not be so benign. These children having a lot of abnormalities in their brains in sleep may be having more school and academic problems than we initially thought.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very important to speak to your neurologist about not only the seizures, but how they're doing in school, what the learning is like, and what the attention is like. Even though they may not be clinically having seizures and are on no medication, it may be effecting their learning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Their school, the acquisition of knowledge, the memory that takes place during sleep at night.\n\nSpeaker 2: So benign rolandic epilepsy may not be that benign. It's a seizure that usually happens late at night caused by sleep deprivation. You may or may not need medication. You can discuss that with your neurologist. But check out what's going on in school because that's an important part of the whole picture.\n\nSpeaker 1: These kids are prime candidates for having a real neuropsychological evaluation which tests for learning disabilities, attention issues, and memory, to really keep on top of it and make sure nothing is happening that we can't prevent with medication.", "title": "What's Benign Rolandic Epilepsy (BRE)? | Epilepsy", "publishedDate": "2012-07-27T22:46:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "02_YFvhoZN4", "description": "", "title": "Mugwort", "publishedDate": "2010-07-23T16:43:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "02__3UTqXmU", "description": "How new technology will change the mechanics of government services - in plainish English\n\nBy http://twitter.com/markwfoden\n\nHuge thanks to John McCubbin for his help in making this video - http://twitter.com/johnbmccubbin", "title": "The Gubbins of Government", "publishedDate": "2013-06-18T21:02:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "02_aaVSRJH0", "description": "September 12, 2014\n\nToday, we had the opportunity to share table discussions about \"Neighborliness\", enjoy a delicious meal, and a performance by Jorge Guzman, The Integrolist. \n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/raindropelpaso.turkishhouse\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ElpTurkishHouse", "title": "Performance by Jorge Guzman, The Integrolist.", "publishedDate": "2014-09-13T02:53:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "02_plJnUzdQ", "description": "the storefront\uff1ahttps://www.facebook.com/thestorefront.japan", "title": "the storefront \"\u60c5\u71b1\u5927\u9678 Cover Full Ver.\"", "publishedDate": "2012-06-19T07:51:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "02_y_LnuYhI", "description": "Choosing a contraceptive pill is always difficult, as there are so many to choose from.

Following on from our previous video, this shows some Hussar wings, with a bit of pilchard on it for berley.    What happen is the Pilchard bait acts as a bit of berley and gets the fish interested.  It's a soft bait, and will readily break up and come of the hook quite easily.  I always put this on as a bit of entree to help stir the fish up, get them interested, and have a tougher bait on such as Squid and Flesh baits.  Keep it in mind next time you go reef fishing.  You definately get the better quality reef fish on the flesh and wings, such as in this video.\nRed Emperor love Hussar baits, and off course Hussar are found where you catch Red emperor, so an obvious food source.   Big Hussar are good for eating, beautiful sweet flesh, but the smaller ones, we'll cut up for bait, but remember they have to be legal size of course.  This also goes for your other small fish.   The wings are often wasted, and thrown over with the frame, I'm a big believer in the wings and this videos shows it works.  Also use the tail, and a bit of colour from the fin is great as a lure.  With some meat on the tail, another top bait, and get's away from they pickers.\nThis was taken on a three day charter, and did we get into some reds and a heap of quality reef fish, spanish mackerel were thick too, so some awesome fishing on the Great Barrier Reef.

The body length of adults of this slug species is 10-20 cm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limax_maximus  \n\nApart from slugs, which have no external shell  like  - Arion and Limax slugs  -  there are also different grades of shell reduction among so called semi-slugs (generally also referred to as slugs, just like the complete kind, but also among glass snails  - Vitrinidae -  and true glass snails  - Zonitidae. Those groups still do have a shell, but it is glassy and translucent, hence the groups' name. A larger extent of shell reduction can be seen in carnivorous semi-slug families, such as  - Testacellidae and  - Daudebardias. http://www.molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html\n\nBrekkusnigill - Deroceras agreste\n\nSniglum var samkv\u00e6mt hef\u00f0bundinni d\u00fdrafr\u00e6\u00f0i skipt ni\u00f0ur \u00ed \u00ferj\u00e1 undirh\u00f3pa: Fort\u00e1lkna  - Prosobranchia - , bert\u00e1lkna  - Opistobranchia) og lungnasnigla  - Pulmonata -  en \u00feessi flokkun er n\u00fana a\u00f0 breytast og flestir farnir a\u00f0 flokka bert\u00e1lkna (Opistobranchia) s\u00e9r.

There were 267 wild horses gathered over the course of six days in three different capture locations within this area and one outside the HMA. The number of horses gathered and released should achieve the Appropriate Management Level (AML) of 185 animals to maintain the overall objective of healthy horses on healthy rangelands.\n\nWith passage of the Wild Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971, Congress found that: \"Wild horses are living symbols of the pioneer spirit of the West.\" In addition, the Secretary was ordered to \"manage wild free-roaming horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands.\" \n\nThe Challis HMA encompasses 154,150 acres of public land in the BLM's Challis Field Office. The HMA is bordered on the north by the Salmon River, on the west by the East Fork of the Salmon River, on the south by the ridgeline between Herd Creek and Road Creek and on the east by U.S. Highway 93. The BLM studies each HMA to determine how many wild horses the area can support while providing for other land uses and resource values. The overall capacity of the HMA to support wild horses is called its Appropriate Management Level (AML). Challis has an AML of 185 horses. The CFO manages the HMA through monitoring vegetation studies, census flights and gather activities. Since the Act's passage in 1971, BLM has placed more than 230,000 horses into private care. The horses gathered from the Challis Herd Management Area will be available for adoption at the Challis Wild Horse Corrals in December.", "title": "Challis Wild Horse Gather - Mares Released on October 31", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T16:59:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "02zxWD-1Xaw", "description": "", "title": "Linnaea Recital Rehearsal", "publishedDate": "2013-06-08T02:20:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "02zz8ACV-bk", "description": "3/8/2014.\nThe boys had a lot of fun, the last gig in their support of Devilskin, and it was Viv's birthday!\n\nHappy Birthday Bro.\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Demon-Fetal-Harvest/139949912842146?ref=hl", "title": "Demon Foetal Harvest play 'She Wolf', live at The James Cabaret, Wellington.", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T09:47:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "03-0cPSnc8o", "description": "Visit http://simusic.hk for more!

The crew sets up camp deep in the Teton Range hitting 5,000-foot dream lines all on foot. Check out urban riding in the war-torn Winter Olympic venues of Sarajevo. Explore the massive untapped terrain of Sella Nevea, Italy during a record winter where they struggle to keep lifts and chalets from completely disappearing into the snow. Finally, feel the madness as TGR's full cast of athletes meets in Revelstoke for a mind-blowing session producing some of the most diverse riding in the world. Almost Ablaze takes you beyond the boundaries. Experience a rarely seen state of being and level of excitement where one missed step will result in total chaos.\n\n\"The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later.

The piece centers its focus on the period the two spent at the center and drifted apart into disillusionment and eventually madness.\n\n****** Derrick and Emily are working on a new immersive experience to be set in the Knockdown center, called Debut.

Creating a standardized school system allows individuals to attain the same education from any school, allowing the population to be educated better.  Though, with an large population, like the United States has; forming proper standardization is problematic because it is troublesome to prove students are getting the proper education, which standardization is supposed to bring about.  The main method to show students are getting/have a proper education is through the use of standardized testing like the SAT, ACT, and the Florida FCAT.  Although testing by itself is not a problem, the methods which the test is done can be.  Some of these dilemmas are caused by the lack of the use of critical thinking skills in the testing, the method which the test is proctored and over emphasis on the test.  Improving the way standardized tests are formulated and conducted, putting less emphasis on the standardized testing, and centralizing around the students needs and wants would improve the present school system and make it more palatable for the students within it.  This shift would also allow more students to shift into the real world after completing school instead of just being able to answer test questions.\n\nMusic belongs to NINTENDO\nimages from Microsoft Word 2007's clip art\n\nPlease rate, comment and/or respond.", "title": "The wrong standerd (standardized testing)", "publishedDate": "2009-04-29T20:20:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "03HrRTrKmP4", "description": "Version karaok\u00e9 du morceau \"Suce moi la Bite\" feat GERARD BASTE(svinkels, Qhuit, Klub des 7)\npr\u00e9sent sur le 1er album de la Pri\u00e8re du Poulet!\nAlbum 20 titres en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement libre sur:\nhttp://prieredupoulet.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/prieredupoulet", "title": "SUCE MOI LA B*TE..._L.P.D.P feat GERARD BASTE(version karaok\u00e9)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T10:11:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "03HubY27wm8", "description": "The Kingdom of Hejaz was a state in the Hejaz region ruled by the Hashemite family.

Does wiping away sweat actually help you keep cool? \nNot really. Sweat releases heat by evaporative cooling. As each gram of sweat transitions from liquid to gas phase, it absorbs 2,427 joules of energy from the body and dissipates the heat into the environment. If you wipe away the perspiration before it evaporates, that process gets cut short, and you'll need to sweat more just to achieve the same degree of cooling. \nDripping sweat is problematic for anyone who has grown large\u2014no matter how athletic they are. When we put on weight and muscle, we don't add sweat glands. As a result, people with bigger frames have fewer glands on the surface of their skin, so perspiration won't cover their bodies as evenly, and they have to increase their sweat output to compensate. \nDespite rumors to the contrary, studies have shown that fit and unfit people sweat at similar rates when pedaling stationary bicycles at the same speed. In fact, personal sweating rates seem to vary with heat production, body mass, and body surface area rather than fitness level.\nSome of our most popular methods of getting cooler are actually poor strategies in the long run. Cranking the air conditioning prevents your body from acclimating to the heat by maximizing sweat rates and reducing the loss of electrolytes during perspiration. Cold drinks may look good in commercials (Gatorade commercial clip?) but they don't actually keep you cool. Hot beverages, on the other hand, help find your full, sweaty potential\u2014a good thing. So, next time you're ordering that iced coffee, make it a regular. \n.", "title": "Explainer: Does Wiping Away Sweat Keep You Cool?", "publishedDate": "2012-06-30T14:06:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "03IJdzxS74E", "description": "Lyrics to Attention Span :\n(feat.

from the area of S. Stefano Rotondo, Rome\n\nMithras is depicted as being born from a rock. He is shown as emerging from a rock, already in his youth, with a dagger in one hand and a torch in the other. He is nude, is wearing a Phrygian cap and is holding his legs together.\nHowever, there are variations and sometimes he is shown as coming out of the rock as a child and in one instance he has a globe in one hand, sometimes a thunderbolt is seen. There are also depictions in which flames are shooting from the rock and also from Mithras' phrygian cap. One statue had its base perforated so that it could serve as a fountain and the base of another has the mask of the water god. Sometimes he also has other weapons like bows and arrows and there are also animals like dog, serpent, dolphin, eagle, some other birds, a lion, crocodile, lobster and snail around. On some reliefs, there is a bearded figure identified as Oceanus, the water god, and on some there are the four wind gods. In these reliefs, the four elements could be invoked together. Sometimes Victoria, Luna, Sol and Saturn also seem to play a role. Saturn particularly appears to hand over the dagger to Mithras so that he could perform his mighty deeds.\nIn some depictions Cautes and Cautopates are also present and sometimes they become shepherds.\nOn some occasions, an amphora is seen, and a few instances show variations like an egg birth or a tree birth. Some interpretations show that the birth of Mithras was celebrated by lighting torches or candles.\nfrom Wiki", "title": "National Roman Museum Baths of Diocletian, Rock-born Mithras and Mithraic artifacts (manortiz)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T09:49:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "03PxplfreHM", "description": "KKK Rally Cumberland, MD.", "title": "Protestors chasing KKK out of Cumberland 4/26/14", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T01:45:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "03Q2B9LYdEY", "description": "U.S. Marines defend Baghdad University from insurgent forces in Baghdad, Iraq.", "title": "U.S. Marines Battle Insurgents In Baghdad, Iraq", "publishedDate": "2009-04-13T00:34:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "03Q37xBvWNY", "description": "", "title": "Christmas pup, Piper the Golden Retriever", "publishedDate": "2011-12-25T14:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "03QB2_dRNAE", "description": "Kijk de hele aflevering op: http://www.rtlxl.nl/#!/gemist/voetbal-international-197775\n\nWat zou Johan Derksen doen als hij bondscoach was?

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "pandal decorated with earthen pots", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T11:25:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "03m769tnAB8", "description": "This nostalgic song honors the first face of the gold dollar coin: Sacagawea.", "title": "Sacagawea", "publishedDate": "2008-12-10T22:09:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "03meBpzqSmM", "description": "This lesson describes how to add logarithms.", "title": "Logarithm Properties Lesson 2", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T20:55:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "03n-NwuwxVE", "description": "Chers amis, suite \u00e0 de nombreux \"abus\" les commentaires sont d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9s sur cette chaine.

I'm the Registrar of Innis College, one of the seven colleges in the Faculty of Arts and Science, and you're watching FAStanswers. \n\nThere are 4 pieces of university identification that a Faculty of Arts and Science student requires: \n\u2022 a U of T Student Number\n\u2022 a UTORid\n\u2022 a TCard, and\n\u2022 a University of Toronto email account.  \n\nWhen you applied to U of T, you were given a University of Toronto application number. That number is converted to your permanent U of T Student Number. You use it to sign into the Student Web Service (ROSI). \n\nYour UORid is the code that you used in order to browse the JoinUofT Portal. It includes some or all of your last name, perhaps part of the letters of your first name and perhaps a random number. \n\nOnce you're an active student in the Faculty of Arts and Science, you will use your UTORid to access course-related web pages and various other web tools. \n\nThe other two pieces of identification: The TCard and a U of T email account. Every student has to have a TCard and a UTmail+ account. And you need the first in order to get the second. \n\nThe TCard is a photo ID smart card. It's your library card. It gets you access to the activity centres such as Hart House and the Athletic Centre, as well as to the student services such as Health and Wellness Centre, the Career Centre, the Housing Centre. It contains a computer chip that holds money, so that you can use it for printing and photocopying on campus and for loading flex dollars to pay for food almost anywhere on campus. You can even use the TCard for discounts on the TTC and Go Transit.\n\nMost importantly, you'll use the TCard when you write exams and -- as I've mentioned -- when you set up your U of T email.\n\nNow, you get your TCard in person at the TCard Office in Robarts Library during their hours of operation which are listed in the description section below. You need to bring your print or email offer of admission as well a government-issued piece of identification with your photo on it (that would include a driver's licence, a health card, or a passport). At Robarts, they'll take your picture, create your TCard and also give you a personalized sheet of paper that has something on it called a secret activation key. You don't want to lose this. \n\nThen you'll sign up for your UTmail+ account. This is the University's official way of contacting you, and it's the only email address that the Faculty of Arts and Science will use to contact students. \n\nYou activate your UTmail+ online using the Secret Activation Key that you got on that piece of paper at Robarts) and from there you get a pretty impressive email account that has 50 gigs of memory for inbox and file storage. \n\nTo summarize: \n4 pieces of identification. \n\u2022 U of T Student Number\n\u2022 UTORid\n\u2022 TCard and\n\u2022 Your UTmail+ account.\n\nFinally, if you're not in Toronto until September, don't worry. You can easily get your TCard and your UTmail+ email when you arrive.\n\nThanks for watching.

The BossHoss hingegen werden in dieser Staffel erstmalig nicht dabei sein. F\u00fcr die Cowboys und deren roten Doppelstuhl wurde aber ein w\u00fcrdiger Ersatz gefunden:  Mit Smudo und Michi Beck  von den Fantastischen Vier , konnte sich The Voice of Germany ein St\u00fcck deutsche Musikgeschichte sichern. Seit ihrem ersten Charterfolg \"Die da?!\" sind die Kult-Hip-Hopper nie richtig von der Bildfl\u00e4che verschwunden.
