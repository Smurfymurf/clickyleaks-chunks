Flashbacks tell the story of how Cameron accidentally killed Joseph's mother and how Joseph was bitten by Cameron and is not yet aware that he is a Vampire.

It patience and sheer doggedness that finally did the trick -- the stuff, of course, champions are made of.\n\nRoberto Mancini claimed his forwards had disappointed him at Chelsea and his response was to recall Balotelli to partner Sergio Aguero.\n\nWith Mario the unwanted holder of the Premier League striker with most shots on target -- 23 -- without finding the net, this surely was the perfect platform to really kick-start his season.\n\nMaicon and Javi Garcia were also drafted back into the starting line-up as the Blues attempted to extend an unbeaten run that started last April against West Brom -- the very same evening Wigan were beating United to blow the title race wide open when all seemed lost.\n\nThe first-half of this contest was largely forgettable with some sloppy passing from both sides prevented any real flowing moves or genuine chances for the Blues and the Latics perhaps just edged proceedings going into the break.\n\nCity waited until first half injury time to really test Ali Al Habsi with Yaya Toure muscling his way into the box from a tight angle before firing in a low drive which the host keeper saved at his near post -- with virtually the last kick.\n\nWigan had looked lively down the flanks but Joe Hart wasn't called upon to make any saves of note.\n\nThe Blues started the second period looking more potent and were a shade unlucky not be awarded a penalty when Gareth Barry had his shirt tugged at least twice as he tried to connect with Yaya's tempting cross into the six-yard box.\n\nThen Balotelli headed wide from close range from Aguero's deep cross -- it seemed playing in front of the travelling 4,500 City fans was lifting the players -- either that or Mancini had given his troops the hairdryer treatment at the break!\n\nDespite the improvement, Wigan should have opened the scoring on 56 minutes when a totally unmarked Arouna Kone found himself with just Hart to beat as Ronnie Stam's cross came in, but thankfully he somehow missed the target by a few inches.\n\nThe Blues were looking second best again as the home side gradually built up a head of steam as they continually found space behind the midfield holding pair of Barry and Garcia -- the latter was withdrawn and replaced with James Milner just past the hour-mark as Mancini shuffled his pack before his team fell behind.\n\nAnd when Aleks Kolarov replaced Aguero on 67 minutes, there were one or two jeers from the travelling faithful -- but they needn't have worried because within 60 seconds, City, at last, took the lead.\n\nBarry fired a low drive in from 20 yards which Al Habsi parried and Balotelli ensured he was first to the loose ball, firing in one shot that was saved but making no mistake with his second attempt which gave the keeper no chance.\n\nThe relief was tangible and four minutes later, Milner doubled the lead with a thunderous of a shot into the top corner from the edge of the box sending the travelling Blues wild and secured three hard-earned points in the process.\n\n\nMatch details\n\nWednesday 28 November 2012, 8:00PM\nDW Stadium Att:21,000 \nBarclays Premier League\n\nReferee: \nMark Halsey\n\nTeams\n\nWigan Athletic:\nAl Habsi, Kone, Beausejour, McCarthy, Jones (McAthur 74), Stam (McManaman 90+2), Boyce, Gomez, Figueroa, Lopez, Di Santo\n\nUnused subs: \nPollitt, Boselli, Fyvie, Golobart, Redmond\n\nBookings: \nGomez\n\nManchester City:\nHart, Maicon, Zabaleta, Nastasic, Kompany, Barry, Garcia (Milner 60 (K Toure 81)), Yaya Toure, Silva, Aguero (Kolarov 68), Balotelli\n\nUnused subs: \nPantilimon, Dzeko, Sinclair, Tevez\n\nBookings: \nBarry", "title": "Wigan 0-2 City Roberto Mancini Reaction EPL 12-13", "publishedDate": "2012-11-28T22:47:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vP5w4npQxM", "description": "http://kingunderground.bandcamp.com/album/code-of-silence-prod-lewis-parker", "title": "Lil Dap (of Group Home) - Self Esteem (Prod. by Lewis Parker)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T07:13:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vP83KNtjAc", "description": "", "title": "Naomi n Judy roll", "publishedDate": "2010-02-14T20:15:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vPKlzsjzQ8", "description": "The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment conducts squad tactics on Fort Hood.

Here we demonstrate, using a novel method for automated recording of mouse micturition, that connexin43, a bladder gap junction protein, is a negative regulator of functional bladder capacity. Bladder connexin43 levels and functional capacity show circadian oscillations in wild-type mice, but such rhythms are completely lost in Cry-null mice having a dysfunctional biological clock. Bladder muscle cells have an internal clock, and show oscillations of connexin43 and gap junction function. A clock regulator, Rev-erba, upregulates connexin43 transcription as a cofactor of Sp1, using Sp1 cis-elements of the promoter. Therefore, circadian oscillation of connexin43 is associated with the biological clock and contributes to diurnal changes in bladder capacity, which avoids disturbance of sleep by micturition.\n\n- Supplementary information Movies\n\n1.Supplementary Movie 1 (691 kB)\nhttp://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n5/extref/ncomms1812-s2.mov\nOscillation of bioluminescence in the muscle layer of the bladder of Per2::luc mice in an ex-vivo slice culture.", "title": "The Bladder's Biological Clock", "publishedDate": "2012-05-04T13:03:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vSKilKlzc0", "description": "Windows 7 Administrative Tools not working under control panel or having empty folder issue then here is video tutorial on how to fix this issue.

The text is a 1523 translation by Martin Luther of the Advent hymn \"Veni, Redemptor gentium\" of St. Ambrose (340-397 AD), bishop of Milan.  The hymn (which has an opening verse \"Intende qui regis Israel\" that is normally omitted) was probably written towards the end of Ambrose's life.  Ambrose also wrote the text \"Deus, Creator Omnium\" for which I have composed a setting for choir and organ (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSxrEKoOGg).  St. Augustine, who was a friend of Ambrose, quotes part of the \"Veni, Redemptor gentium\" in his autobiographical \"Confessions\" written the year after the death of Ambrose.\n\nMartin Luther's famous translation was published in Erfurt in 1524 in the \"Enchiridion Oder Handb\u00fcchlein geistlicher Ges\u00e4nge und Psalmen.\"  The plainchant music to \"Veni, Redemptor gentium\" is first documented in a manuscript of around 1120 in Einsiedeln, Switzerland.  The plainchant was adapted by Martin Luther for his German translation and his version of the melody appeared with his text in 1524.\n\nThere are a large number of English translations.  Here is an 1851 one by William Morton Reynolds:\n\n1. Savior of the nations, come;\nVirgin's Son, here make Thy home!\nMarvel now, O heaven and earth,\nThat the Lord chose such a birth.\n\n2. Not by human flesh and blood;\nBy the Spirit of our God\nWas the Word of God made flesh,\nWoman's offspring, pure and fresh.\n\n3. Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child\nOf the virgin undefiled!\nThough by all the world disowned,\nStill to be in heaven enthroned.\n\n4. From the Father forth He came\nAnd returneth to the same,\nCaptive leading death and hell\nHigh the song of triumph swell!\n\n5. Thou, the Father's only Son,\nHast over sin the victory won.\nBoundless shall Thy kingdom be;\nWhen shall we its glories see?\n\n6. Brightly doth Thy manger shine,\nGlorious is its light divine.\nLet not sin overcloud this light;\nEver be our faith thus bright.\n\n7. Praise to God the Father sing,\nPraise to God the Son, our King,\nPraise to God the Spirit be\nEver and eternally.\n\nHere are the complete texts of Ambrose and Martin Luther's translation.\n\n1. Veni, Redemptor gentium;\nOstende partum virginis;\nMiretur omne saeculum.\nTalis decet partus Deo.\n\n2. Non ex virili semine,\nSed mystico spiramine\nVerbum Dei tactum est caro,\nFructusque ventris floruit.\n\n3. Alvus tumescit virginis.\nClaustrum pudoris permanet;\nVexilla virtutum micant,\nVersatur in templo Deus.\n\n4. Procedit e thalamo suo,\nPudoris aulo regia,\nGeminae gigans substantiae\nAlacris ut currat viam.\n\n5.

It is different from the other products in the Global Care Products Line, containing only enzymes. SP7 also contains safe, living bacteria, which are completely harmless and non-toxic. The combination of the two ingredients allows SP7 to do what no other waste control product of its kind can do. Organic wastes are things like cooking grease, body oils that come off in the shower and sewage from bathrooms and boat bilges. SP7 makes it easy to biodegrade these kinds of unpleasant wastes, preventing and solving all kinds of difficult and sometimes costly problems.\n\nSpecially formulated waste-battling enzymes breakdown and liquefy the organic wastes. Then the concentration of natural bacteria (100 billion/gallon) consumes the liquefied waste, converting it into inert compounds like water and carbon dioxide. One of the many household uses is to add SP7 to kitchen drain lines, septic systems and grease traps. Left untreated, grease and fat adhere to kitchen pipes and can attract food particles that rot, causing unpleasant odors and stoppages. Most people currently use caustic, highly toxic chemical products to fix this kind of problem. What they do not realize is that these products can erode pipes and kill septic tank bacteria, disabling the septic system. They should, instead, add SP7 to their kitchen and bathroom drains. This will take animal fats (which are tri-glycerides), for example, and convert them to fatty acids and glycerol, and finally to H20 and CO2. SP7 is extremely effective, non-corroding, safe and biodegradable, and actually helps your septic system and unclogs clogged leaching fields. Moreover, SP7 can be used as preventative maintenance, as opposed to just a remedy.\n\nAdding SP7 to toilets \"supercharges\" the septic system, dramatically reducing regular costly pump-outs, and maintenance. The enzymes help break down the organic sewage and liquefy grease, and the bacteria not only consume the waste but also re-establish the desirable bacteria count that household chemicals like ammonia or bleach may have killed.\n\nSP7 is meant to tackle tough problems not only at home but those related to organic waste from hospitals, hotels, nursing homes, restaurants, supermarkets, food processing plants, sewage plants, farms, recreational vehicle and marine holding tanks and port-a-toilets. The customer base for SP7 is enormous.\n\nSP7 contains enzymes that solubilize organic waste materials, and bacteria, which then digest the solubilized material. By these actions, SP7 acts as an all-purpose waste degrader/odor controller in a safe manner.\n\nSP7 reduces the need for excessive pumping, and produces immediate and residual odor control. It is a non-corrosive and environmentally safe alternate to dangerous, caustic chemicals.\n\nWith respect to dumping effectively treated wastes overboard into lakes, rivers, or salt water, this all depends upon governing regulations of responsible agencies in different locations.", "title": "GlobalCare\u2122 SP7\u2122 All-Purpose Degrader & Odor Controller", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T19:31:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5v_CWPqa0u8", "description": "Cena deletada do filme Tailand\u00eas \"Yes or no\".

The original World Trade Center was a complex of seven buildings. It featured landmark twin towers, which opened on April 4, 1973 and were destroyed in the September 11 attacks of 2001, along with 7 World Trade Center. The other buildings in the complex were damaged in the attacks, and their ruins were eventually demolished. The site is being rebuilt with five new skyscrapers and a memorial to the casualties of the attacks. As of November 2011, only one skyscraper has been completed; the other four are expected to be completed before 2020. One World Trade Center will be the lead building for the new complex, reaching more than 100 stories at its completion.[2] It became the tallest building in New York City on April 30, 2012, and is expected to be finished by 2013. A sixth tower is awaiting confirmation.\nAt the time of their completion, the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower) and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower), known collectively as the Twin Towers, were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings included 3 WTC (the Marriott World Trade Center), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC (which housed United States Customs), and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985.\nThe complex was designed in the early 1960s by Minoru Yamasaki and Associates of Troy, Michigan, and Emery Roth and Sons of New York.[3] The twin 110-story towers used a tube-frame structural design. To gain approval for the project, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed to take over the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, which became the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH). Groundbreaking for the World Trade Center took place on August 5, 1966. The North Tower was completed in December 1972 and the South Tower was finished in July 1973. The construction project involved excavating a large amount of material, which was later used as landfill to build Battery Park City on the west side of Lower Manhattan. The cost for the construction was $400 million ($2,300,000,000 in 2013 dollars).[4] The complex was located in the heart of New York City's downtown financial district and contained 13.4 million square feet (1.24 million m2) of office space.[5][6]\nThe Windows on the World restaurant was located on the 106th and 107th floors of 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower) while the Top of the World observation deck was located on the 107th floor of 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower). The second King Kong film was filmed in 1976 with some scenes mentioning and showing the World Trade Center.\nThe World Trade Center experienced a fire on February 13, 1975, a bombing on February 26, 1993 and a robbery on January 14, 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority decided to privatize the World Trade Center, leasing the buildings to a private company to manage, and awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in July 2001.\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex, one into each tower, in a coordinated terrorist attack. After burning for 56 minutes, the South Tower (2) collapsed, followed a half-hour later by the North Tower (1), with the attacks on the World Trade Center resulting in 2,753 deaths.[7] 7 World Trade Center collapsed later in the day and the other buildings, although they did not collapse, had to be demolished because they were damaged beyond repair. The process of cleanup and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months.\nOver the following years, plans for a rebuilt World Trade Center took form. The first new building at the site was 7 World Trade Center, which opened in May 2006. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), established in November 2001 to oversee the rebuilding process, organized competitions to select a site plan and memorial design. Memory Foundations, designed by Daniel Libeskind, was selected as the master plan, but this went through substantial changes in design. The new World Trade Center complex will include One World Trade Center, three other high-rise office towers, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.", "title": "World Trade Center Construction 1968-1972", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T06:05:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vgDtE4NasM", "description": "\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0644\u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0633 \u0627\u0628 \u064a\u062e\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0642\u062f \u0648\u0635\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0648\u062a\u0645 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0623\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u062c\u062f\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u0639\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u064a\u062c\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0628\u062a\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0627\u064a\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0641\u0636\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u0647\u0627.\n\n\u25c0 \u062d\u0645\u0651\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0628\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.egyptoon.app\n\n\u25c0 \u062a\u0646\u0628\u064a\u0647: \u064a\u062d\u0638\u0631 \u0625\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0631\u0641\u0639 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0641\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0648\u0643\u060c \u0644\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a \u064a\u0631\u062c\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0629.\n\n\u25c0 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0641\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0625\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0628\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0629 http://goo.gl/b8Yyuq\n\n\u25c0 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 :-\n  \u25cf \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0648\u0643| https://www.facebook.com/Egyptoon\n  \u25cf \u062a\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0631| https://twitter.com/egyptoon\n  \u25cf \u062c\u0648\u062c\u0644 \u0628\u0644\u0633| https://plus.google.com/+Egyptoon\n  \u25cf \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0645\u064a| http://egyptoon.net\n  \u25cf \u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0645| http://instagram.com/egyptoon\n\n\u25c0 \u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0628\u0631\u0623\u064a\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0639\u062c\u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u062a\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0643 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0631 !\n\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u062a\u0643\u0645 \u2764\n\n\u25cf \u0625\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0628\u062a\u0648\u0646 .. \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0634\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062c\u0632 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646.\n\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0648\u0628.", "title": "\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0641\u0636\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u062a\u0633 \u0627\u0628 | Leaked video - WhatsApp blue ticks", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T05:29:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vgnAzsNEpk", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Tommy vs scott pembroke scraps", "publishedDate": "2011-05-25T02:21:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vh2HrMy-8I", "description": "This is a video of a small thermobaric firecracker I made as an experiment.

This changes when he meets the charismatic Max (Elyas M'Barek). The two of them couldn't be more different, but they share one mutual interest: hacking. Together with Max's friends, impulsive Stephan (Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring) and paranoid Paul (Antoine Monot) they form the subversive hacker group CLAY (Clowns Laughing @ You) . CLAY provokes with hilarious hacks and has the finger on the pulse of a whole generation. For the first time in his life Benjamin feels like he belongs and even attractive Marie (Hannah Herzsprung) starts to notice him. What started out as fun soon turns deadly serious, when Benjamin and CLAY are suddenly investigated by German Secret Service and Europol. With Hanne Lindberg (Trine Dyrholm), the leading Europol cybercrime investigator, at their heels, Benjamin starts to realize that he is no longer a nobody, but one of the most wanted hackers of the world.\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

It is believed that the sasando had already been known to the Rote people since the 7th\u00a0century.[citation needed]\nThe main part of the sasando is a bamboo tube that serves as the frame of the instrument. Surrounding the tube are several wooden pieces serving as wedges where the strings are stretched from the top to the bottom. The function of the wedges is to hold the strings higher than the tube surface as well as to produce various length of strings to create different musical notations. The stringed bamboo tube is surrounded by a bag-like fan of dried lontar or palmyra leafs (Borassus flabellifer), which functions as the resonator of the instrument.[2] The sasando is played with both hands reaching into the stings of the bamboo tube through opening on the front. The player's fingers then pluck the strings in a fashion similar to playing a harp or kacapi.\nThe sasando has 28 or 56 strings. The sasando with 28 strings is called sasando engkel and sometimes has 56 strings, called double strings.", "title": "Sasando Music - Pak Jeremias Paah", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T04:27:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5vxEsCT8r0s", "description": "Ils ont domin\u00e9 l'Italie pendant huit si\u00e8cles avant de se fondre dans l'empire romain.

Le mus\u00e9e Maillol, \u00e0 Paris, remet les Etrusques au go\u00fbt du jour. L'exposition met en lumi\u00e8re leur quotidien m\u00e9connu.

Les 250 objets de l'Etrurie antique illustrent tous les aspects de la culture \u00e9trusque: la religion, l'\u00e9criture, l'armement, le sport, l'\u00e9rotisme, l'art ou encore l'artisanat.\n\n\"Ce sont des objets qui sont difficiles \u00e0 d\u00e9crypter, (ou plut\u00f4t) qui sont int\u00e9ressants \u00e0 d\u00e9crypter, poursuit Vincent Jolivet. Il y a des pi\u00e8ces sur lesquelles vous aurez l'impression qu'il s'est pass\u00e9 quelque chose avec l'Egypte, et \u00e7a peut \u00eatre vrai, d'autres qui vous rappelleront le monde ph\u00e9nicien ou carthaginois, et c'est vrai aussi.

She was sentenced to 10 years probation and a $5,000 fine. \n\nAccording to the police report, the teacher's relationship with the 16-year-old minor had been going on for weeks, and only came to light last April when Scherwitz showed up at an after-prom party at a student's house. She was seen dressed in a \"cut up, cut off shirt\" and no shoes. She allegedly left with the student after another student told her it was inappropriate for her to be there, and asked her to leave. She is believed to have been drinking. \n\nMany were shocked to learn that Scherwitz was spared jail time as the conviction would have been much harsher if it was a male teacher. Prosecutors explained they had settled with the plea deal as the student was almost 17 and Scherwitz agreed to apologize to the student's mother and the district. \n\nIn the letter, Scherwitz wrote, \"I apologized for the behavior I engaged in with a student of BISD. It was wrong. I crossed an ethical boundary I never should have crossed\". \n\nScherwitz resigned from her post last year after authorities questioned her about her relationship with the student, and is not allowed to teach again.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The concert was entitled Meditations for Good Friday. This particular piece is Movement 2 from J.S. Bach's Cantata #159, \"Ich Folge Dir Nach\". The soloists are Gayla Morgan, Soprano and Alison Heymann, Alto. James Carter conducts.\n\nBecause no cantatas were performed in Lent, Bach composed at least four separate cantatas for the Sundays of Quinquagesima, the last Sunday of Epiphany.  At that point in history, the Biblical texts were those that focused on Jesus' prediction of his going up to Jerusalem and his impending crucifixion.  The text of Cantata 159 was written by Bach's favorite collaborator Picander in 1728 with a first performance February 27, 1729.  \n\nIn this second movement the Believer makes her covenant to follow Jesus.\n\nBeliever's Aria and Chorale - \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\"      \nIch folge dir nach    I follow thy path\nIch will hier bei dir stehen   I will here by thee tarry\nDurch Speichel und Schmach;    Do not threat me with scorn!\nVerachte mich doch nicht!

Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. \n\nChristopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. May his 62 years of living, well, so livingly console the many of us who will miss him dearly\n------\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"", "title": "Hitchens '06: News Networks ~ Let 'em All Die", "publishedDate": "2012-04-12T16:35:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wDjs6KiyLY", "description": "The cardboard strip as wicking material hasn't been effective.

The owl was transferred by the DC Police to the Zoo and cared for by Dr. Jessica Siegal-Willott at the Zoo's hospital.\n\nUpon examination, the snowy owl was alert and responsive but subdued. There were no obvious physical injuries but there was blood on the bird. Upon further examination, blood was found in the mouth which is consistent with suspected head trauma. The owl was provided supportive care which included pain medication, Meloxicam, and non-steroid inflammatory drug akin to aspirin and provided fluids sub-cutaneously. \n\nOur team made sure the bird was comfortable and in a quiet atmosphere while waiting for it to be picked up by City Wildlife for rehabilitation. Per standard and established protocol, wild animals such as this snowy owl, are provided care and released back into the wild by a state or in this case a city-affiliated animal organization. \n\nCity Wildlife Biologist Abby Hehmeyer says they will give the owl x-rays in order to determine any missed injuries, but their goal is to release her as soon as possible pending the owl's health and behavior. \n\nThe Zoo's veterinarians believes the owl is female.

Dramatic in-flight video compellingly demonstrates the aerodynamics of stalls & spins during everyday flight. Understanding the nature of stalls and spins before you get in the cockpit makes it easier to recognize when you need to take action when you're in actual flight. A \"must\" for every pilot\u2014regardless of your experience.\n\nFor the complete King Schools selection, please visit http://www.kingschools.com/?sco=WB&scu=YOUT01", "title": "Airplane Stalls - KING SCHOOLS Video", "publishedDate": "2007-04-26T18:58:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wJ1Tmg8fNY", "description": "", "title": "AGGLUTINATION 2014: INTERVISTA AGLI ELVENKING", "publishedDate": "2014-08-24T19:54:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wJ8NJBLHlY", "description": "Kerala Kasavu sari, the traditional handloom dress of Keralites are of extremely pure cotton, bordered with golden brocade.", "title": "Kerala Kasavu Sari, Handloom, Kerala", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T11:07:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wJHYD0PiYA", "description": "With 2011 behind us, it's the time to take a look back at some of the best ESFNA's \"TIZITA\" .", "title": "EBS TV THE BEST COMMERCIAL OF THE YEAR _ SPECIAL REPORT-ATLANTA", "publishedDate": "2012-01-24T03:33:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wJIG7W2Yr4", "description": "Please/Like/Comment/Subscribe!?\nCan We Smash 1kLikes!

Mostly intended for viewing by students in the PSC 41 class at UC Davis.\n______________________\nTranscript:\nAs I\u2019m sure you realize by now, operational definitions are super important in psychological research. They\u2019re really the workhorses of our research, as they\u2019re what makes sure we know what we\u2019re talking about, and let\u2019s other scientists understand us. \n\nOperational definitions need to have enough information in them that another scientist could recreate our variable. But they also shouldn\u2019t have too much information. This is because another scientist might like the variable we selected, but not like exactly how we measured it. Operational definitions, then, need to have enough information that another scientist could recreate the variable, even though they might change how it was measured. This means that you need tell me exactly what is measured, but not exactly how it was measured.\n\nFor the research proposal, it is important that you put the right operational definition for the right variable. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll miss half of the points just for mixing that up! The predictor variable is the independent variable, and it\u2019s the thing that causes the other thing. The outcome variable is the dependent variable, and it gets caused by the predictor variable. Be careful not to mix those up!\n\nIn order to test your knowledge of research methods in psychology, the point of this class, we ask you to describe a certain type of approach to research such as an observational study or a within-subjects manipulation. So it\u2019s really important that you understand what each of those are. Before you write the operational definitions for this type of question on the homework, review your notes and the book for that certain type of design.", "title": "Research proposal - Operational definition", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T00:06:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wPrxAWepSI", "description": "Scorpion 1x06 Promo\nScorpion 1x06\nScorpion\n\nScorpion 1x06 Promo\nScorpion 1x06 Preview/Trailer\nScorpion 1x06 Teaser\nScorpion Season 1 Episode 6 Promo\nScorpion S01E06 Promo\n\nScorpion, Scorpion 1x06, Scorpion 1x06 Promo, Scorpion 1x06 Preview, Scorpion 1x06 Trailer, Scorpion 1x06 Webclip, Scorpion Season 1 Episode 6, Scorpion Season 1 Episode 6 Promo, Scorpion S01E06, Scorpion S01E06 Promo, promo, trailer, preview, CBS\n\nScorpion 1x06 Promo \"True Colors\"\nScorpion 1x06 Sneak Peek\nScorpion 1x06 Preview/Trailer\nScorpion 1x06 Teaser\nScorpion Season 1 Episode 6 Promo\nScorpion S01E06 Promo\nScorpion 1x06 Promo Preview Trailer Webclip Sneak Peek\nScorpion 1.06 Promo\nScorpion 1x06 Promo\nScorpion Season 1 Finale Promo\nScorpion 1x06 \"True Colors\"", "title": "Scorpion 1x06 Promo \"True Colors\"  Season 1 Episode 6 Promo", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T02:38:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wQ2DEHp1aU", "description": "Please visit us at  http://www.TreasureMountainMining.com to see this and over 2,000 more fine mineral specimens", "title": "3.4\" Diameter Gemmy QUARTZ CRYSTAL BALL w/Rainbows+Swirls Inside Brazil for sale", "publishedDate": "2014-02-03T17:59:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wQEo9UZC_4", "description": "Get past the weighty historic references and jingoism and you see it's all a lie.

The announcement is the first time Wolfe has publicly discussed her sexuality.\n\n\"This is the most exciting thing that has ever happened to us,\" Wolfe told People magazine, whose exclusive interview with the couple hits newsstands on Friday. \"But I don't want to bring my daughter into a world where I'm not comfortable telling everyone who I am and who her mother is.\"\n\nWolfe was artificially inseminated by an anonymous donor.\n\nAfter hearing Wolfe's happy news, I called up Don Tollefson, the former Fox 29 sports director, who dated Wolfe for a little over a year during her Philly tenure. Despite their ex-status, Tolly had only kind words for Wolfe.\n\n\"I have not only tremendous well-wishes for her as a person. She comes from an absolutely awesome family. She's so good on the air, and I've always admired her . . . moxie is such a corny word to use. She has incredible curiosity on the air,\" Tollefson told me. \"I've followed her career from afar. I always said to her, 'Be yourself because to be yourself is so appealing to people.' She's obviously taken that and run with it.\"\n\nTollefson is a new dad himself, with 3-year-old Gabriella at home. I suggested a playdate between Gabriella and Wolfe's baby-to-be and he said his girl would certainly be into the idea.\n\nTollefson is the host of \"Tolly's Awesome Friends,\" showcasing local heroes in the community. The show airs on WMCN, an independent TV channel reaching Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Wilmington and Trenton. It is Channel 21 in Philadelphia.

Hanging with Herremans for the night will be Eagles buddies Jon Dorenbos, Brent Celek, LeSean McCoy and Jason Kelce, and former Eagle A.J.

Here are 5 of the world's greatest con artists: \n\nNumber 5  is Frank Abagnale, a former con man who cashed phony checks worth $2.5 million in every US state and in 26 countries. In addition, he impersonated as a pilot, a college professor, an attorney, and a doctor. Steven Spielberg's film, Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks is based on Abagnale's life story. After serving a prison time of 5 years, he has been working with the FBI on combating check forgery for almost 35 years now. \n\nNumber 4 - Victor Lustig.  Born in Austria-Hungary, his first con involved selling a fake 'money box' which could print $100 bills. He was able to fool the rich and wealthy into buying the box for a price as high as $10,000, sometimes even more. In 1925, Victor was even able to sell the Eiffel Tower to a French scrap dealer for $70,000.\n\nNumber 3 - Gregor MacGregor posed as the ruler of a fictitious country in Central America called Poyais. He was able to convince investors and immigrants into buying land in his imaginary country. Gregor backed up his story with a guidebook containing details on Poyais.  Between 1822 and 1833, over 200 settlers sailed for Poyais, only to discover that it was nothing but a fake country.\n\nNumber 2 - George C. Parker. This con man made his living by selling New York landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Interestingly, he was able to sell Brooklyn Bridge twice.  Parker convinced his potential buyers into buying the landmarks by producing impressive replicas of legitimate documents.\n\n Number 1 - Bernie Madoff - Madoff was an eminent figure in the security industry who also served as the vice chairman of NASD. It turned out he orchestrated one of the largest ponzi schemes ever, costing many large firms and thousands of individual investors $50 billion in total.   According to SEC, \"Madoff's investors' phony account statements showed moderate, but consistently positive returns \u2014 even during turbulent market conditions\". He is currently serving a prison sentence of 150 years.", "title": "World's 5 Smartest Con Artists", "publishedDate": "2012-09-14T15:08:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5whS7F3Gi1s", "description": "Empire Comfort Systems presents the ceramic fiber Charred Oak gas log set shown on a 24-inch Vent-Free Slope Glaze Burner.

In a deep champagne goblet.\"\n\n    \"Oui, monsieur.\"\n\n    \"Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?\"\n\n    \"Certainly, monsieur.\" The barman seemed pleased with the idea.\n\n    \"Gosh, that's certainly a drink,\" said Leiter.\n\n    Bond laughed. \"When I'm...er...concentrating,\" he explained, \"I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drink's my own invention. I'm going to patent it when I can think of a good name.\"\n\n    \u2014Ian Fleming, Casino Royale, Chapter 7, \"Rouge et Noir'\n\nFleming continues with Bond telling the barman, after taking a long sip, \"Excellent ... but if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better,\" and then adds in an aside, \"Mais n'enculons pas des mouches\" (English: But let's not bugger flies\u2014a vulgar French expression meaning \"let's not split hairs\").\n\nBond in the next chapter, \"Pink Lights and Champagne\", names it the Vesper. At the time of his first introduction to the beautiful Vesper Lynd, he obtains her name in a perfect \u00abinterrogation indirecte\u00bb, \"I was born in the evening,..on a very stormy evening..,\" and asks to borrow it.\n\nA Vesper differs from Bond's usual cocktail of choice, the martini, in that it uses both gin and vodka, Kina Lillet instead of the usual dry vermouth, and a lemon peel instead of an olive. Although there is a lot of discussion on the Vesper, it is only ordered once throughout Fleming's novels - although Bond drinks the Vesper (\"six of them\") in the film Quantum of Solace - and by later books Bond is ordering regular vodka martinis, though he also drinks regular gin martinis. It may be that Fleming decided not to have Bond order a Vesper again due to the way in which 'Casino Royale' ends.\n\nIn actuality the book version of the Vesper was created by Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce. In Bryce's copy of Casino Royale Fleming inscribed \"For Ivar, who mixed the first Vesper and said the good word.\" In his book You Only Live Once, Bryce details that Fleming was first served a Vesper, a drink of a frozen rum concoction with fruit and herbs, at evening drinks by the butler of an elderly couple in Jamaica, the Duncans, the butler commenting, \"'Vespers' are served.\" Vespers or evensong is the sixth of the seven canonical hours of the divine office and are observed at sunset, the 'violet hour', Bond's later chosen hour of fame for his martini Vesper.\n\nSince both Kina Lillet and Gordon's have been reformulated since 1953, substitutes can be made that attempt to recapture the original flavour of the drink:\n\n    Cocchi Americano is considered an acceptable substitute for the now unavailable Kina Lillet. Also the French aperitif wine Lillet[3][4]\n    For a more traditional flavour, use 50% (100-proof) Vodka to bring the alcohol content of the vodka back to 1953 levels. Grain vodka is preferred.\n    Tanqueray or Broker's gin provides the traditional flavour of 47% (94-proof) gin; whereas Gordon's Gin, in the UK domestic market, has been reformulated to less than 40% (80-proof). A 47% (94-proof) Export version of Gordon's Gin still exists today (The extra dilution caused by shaking is the reason to prefer it over stirring in this high-alcohol drink).\n    A modern cocktail glass, which is larger today than was common in 1953, is often substituted for the deep Champagne goblet (see Champagne stemware for the original look of the drink)[citation needed]\n\nVariations\n\nEsquire printed the following update of the recipe in 2006:\n\n    \"Shake (if you must) with plenty of cracked ice. 3 oz Tanqueray gin, 1 oz 50% (100-proof) Stolichnaya vodka, 1/2 oz Lillet Blanc, 1/8 teaspoon (or less) quinine powder or, in desperation, 2 dashes of bitters. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and twist a large swatch of thin-cut lemon peel over the top.", "title": "How to Make The Vesper Martini - Best Drink Recipes", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T21:20:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wkcXUwahV4", "description": "Once Upon a Time 4x09 Promo\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Promo\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Preview/Trailer\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Teaser\nOnce Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 9 Promo\nOnce Upon a Time S04E09 Promo\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Promo \"Fall\"\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Sneak Peek\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Preview/Trailer\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Teaser\nOnce Upon A Time Season 4 Episode 9 Promo\nOnce Upon A Time S04E09 Promo\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Promo Preview Trailer Webclip Sneak Peek\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 Promo\nOnce Upon A Time Season 4 Finale Promo\nOnce Upon a Time 4x09 \"Fall\"\n\nOnce Upon a Time, Once Upon a Time 4x09, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Promo, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Preview, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Trailer, Once Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 9, Once Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 9 Promo, Once Upon a Time S04E09, Once Upon a Time S04E09 Promo, promo, trailer, preview, ABC\n\nOnce Upon a Time, Once Upon a Time 4x09, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Promo, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Preview, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Trailer, Once Upon a Time 4x09 Webclip, Once Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 9, Once Upon a Time Season 4 Episode 9 Promo, Once Upon a Time S04E09, Once Upon a Time S04E09 Promo, promo, preview, trailer, ABC", "title": "Once Upon a Time 4x09 Promo [HD] \"Fall\" Season 4 Episode 9 Promo", "publishedDate": "2014-11-17T03:08:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wkdMycnWZw", "description": "", "title": "FROM ENGLISH TO FRENCH = Enterobacteriaceae", "publishedDate": "2011-10-15T08:19:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wl2aJQnEX0", "description": "For sale \n$40 each or $75 both", "title": "2 baby males abyssinian guinea pig 3 weeks old", "publishedDate": "2011-10-25T18:52:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "5wlarEaYAfQ", "description": "www.floramedicina.com\n\nEnfin une formation professionnelle en phytoth\u00e9rapie en ligne!\n\nNotre formation professionnelle herboriste-th\u00e9rapeute est maintenant offerte en ligne et diffus\u00e9s via une plateforme d'enseignement \u00e0 distance.

He was an active and honest propagator of WAHDAT-E-UMMAT (Unity of Muslim Ummah) and for this cause he struggled in his life till the end. It is his one of the another contribution that he always preached the true essence of Islam, free from any type of negative constraints or influence E.g. schism, exhibition of knowledge, pride or for worldly gain etc. His knowledge was so vast and his memory was remarkable that he used to appreciate the contribution of Ulama (scholars) without any discrimination whether they are Brailvi, Deobandi or Ahle Hadees or whoever else. Maulana Ishaq is equally popular among the youth and the old ones. He is liked among Religious or Liberal class through his teachings/lectures to seek guidance from it. \n\n\nMaulana Mufti Ishaq rahmatullah ailah never associated him to any group (Maslak) instead he always called himself a Muslim and his all lectures are purely related to the original primitive teaching of Islam. He always addressed the issues of the questioners and provided them with best solution. This could only be possible if the Religion (ISLAM) is taken into his complete sense.\n\nHis efforts are appreciable and unforgettable. May Allah bless him with Jannat ul firdous .

Attorney-General of Canada. That decision was appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal where five judges heard the appeal and decided:\n\n1. The federal government had twelve months to reform the Criminal Code (the \"Code\") provision against prostitutes operating out of brothels, massage parlours and other forms of common bawdy houses; which would do nothing to protect the rank and file exploited women, men and children working on the street.\n\n2. The Code provision that prohibits communicating for the purposes of prostitution was upheld; i.e. you can buy and you can sell but you can't advertise or negotiate a price.\n\n3. And, the section of the Code dealing with living on the avails of prostitution was amended by the court so that it will only apply to those doing so in an exploitive way; which would accommodate the rare few with the capacity to structure a sex-for-sale business with support staff.\n\nThe decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal was stayed (i.e., the law stays as it is written in the Criminal Code) until the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which was rendered in December 2013. It struck down all three provisions of Canada's prostitution laws, creating a legal vacuum. The current laws remain in place for one year, during which time the Government of Canada has the option to abandon them or implement new laws.", "title": "The EFC on Prostitution Law Reform", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T21:38:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xNxQfVNVR8", "description": "Native snails in NZ are big, mean and carnivorous.

The name of the protest is a reference to the growing international movement to impose Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) on the state of Israel until it ends the occupation of Palestine, complies with international law, and allows Palestinian refugees the right of return to their homeland.\n\nActivists across the world have joined the protests through a social media campaign to jam the AIPAC conference Twitter hash tags, #AIPAC14 and #AIPACpride, and activists have effectively taken over the online conversation. A controversial parody video of the AIPAC conference promotional clip has also gone viral, and AIPAC has threatened to sue CODEPINK over it.\n\nA themed protest took place throughout the day to expose AIPAC's dangerous foreign policy positions. These themes included calls for no war on Iran, an end to Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, and an end to billions of US taxpayer dollars every year in military aid to Israel.

This right here is all you need. It's the Samsung SE-218CB/RSBS USB Ultra Portable External DVD Writer, and it's the best external DVD drive for Mac and Windows. Why is it the best? Well it's affordable, portable, recordable, and supportable. Let me explain. It's affordable because it's less than $30 with free shipping on Amazon.\n\nIt's portable because it's slim (only 5.83\" x 0.55\" x 5.67\") and it's USB-powered meaning it doesn't require a separate power cable.\n\nIt's recordable because it can burn all kinds of discs such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-R dual layer just to name a few.\n\nIt's supportable because it works right out of the box with Mac OS X, Windows 7, and Windows 8 (even works with older versions of Windows too). It comes with a USB cable, which is really all you need to get started. Just plug it in and it's ready to go.\n\nIt does have some pretty fast read/write speeds too, with an average of 3MB per second read speed. I also like the way it looks. It has a sleek back design, and it's pretty lightweight. So if you're looking for one of the best external DVD drives for less than half the cost of a SuperDrive, then this is a great choice.\n\nSubscribe! http://goo.gl/RqU0nl\nTwitter http://Twitter.com/slye\nFacebook http://Facebook.com/MyTechMethods\nGoogle+ http://goo.gl/WHzrbV\nInstagram http://instagram.com/slye\nWebsite http://MyTechMethods.com\nShare this video! http://youtu.be/5xYDK8wAs_c\nThanks for watching:\nBest External DVD Drive for Mac & PC: Samsung SE-218CB\nRoyalty-free music:\n\"Blown Away\" by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com)", "title": "Best External DVD Drive for Mac & PC: Samsung SE-218CB", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T22:03:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xYTHpGksQ0", "description": "", "title": "Baxtiyar Salimov - ATV Itirilmish Hesabatlar (Lost reports)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-13T22:38:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xYnYzRLegQ", "description": "FREE DOWNLOAD : https://soundcloud.com/mango-records-1/two-bora-bora\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Twoofficial\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MangoRecordsChannel\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DorianOswin\n\nMusic / Lyrics : Dorian Oswin, Mihai Gruia, Sorin Brotnei\nOnline Video : Eberhard Cristian (Electric Pulse)\n\nBora Bora - Online Video.

Like A Course in Miracles, NTI was written through a process of inner-dictation. It was given as a gift to everyone who is ready for spiritual awakening now. It leads toward awakening in a loving and gentle manner, guiding us each step of the way. All that is left for us to do is to practice, with our every breath, everything that NTI teaches.\n\nNTI teaches that we are perfectly free, and as perfect freedom, no experience can be given to us unless we are willing to receive it. That includes the experience of awakening to our truth. Therefore, one important practice of awakening is to focus on our willingness and have gratitude for our willingness so that our willingness to awaken increases and becomes full.\n\nNTI Galatians says, Focus on your willingness as if it is your truth, because it is. Focus on your willingness as if it holds the answer to all questions, because it does. Focus on your willingness as if it is everything to everyone, because it is. Focus on your willingness. That is Love Alive within the world.\n\nIn this segment, Regina talks about the importance of willingness to the purpose of awakening.\n\nTo order The Holy Spirit's Interpretation of the New Testament (NTI), click this link: http://tinyurl.com/2kzhvb", "title": "Regina Dawn Akers - Willingness", "publishedDate": "2008-11-12T20:24:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xdEyVvjswI", "description": "Em ch\u00fac ch\u1ecb lu\u00f4n vui v\u1ebb , lu\u00f4n sinh \u0111\u1eb9p , v\u00e0 l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi y\u00eau em su\u1ed1t cu\u1ed9c \u0111\u1eddi =)).

Paul Bearer would be encased in a glass crypt backstage, covered up to his chest in cement. In the storyline, Heyman demanded that Undertaker throw the match or else see Bearer suffocated in cement. By the time of the pay-per-view, Bearer had recovered from his latest operation and would appear on-screen.\n\nUndertaker won the match but proceeded afterwards to pull the lever that sent cement into the crypt, completely burying Paul Bearer and, in kayfabe terms, suffocating him. (Bearer was not really at the event. The WWE had recorded footage of Paul Bearer in the crypt before the event. During the event, there was a stunt double in the crypt the whole time. That's why the TV audience could only see Paul Bearer and the crypt he was in -- since he wasn't there, they couldn't actually show anyone on screen with Bearer).[4] This shot ended the PPV and caused numerous complaints toward WWE, as in essence they had shown a [kayfabe] murder. The live audience, however, saw an extended ending in which Bearer surfaced for air and was carried from the arena on a stretcher. On the following week's SmackDown!, Bearer was acknowledged to be alive, although gravely injured, for kayfabe purposes. The rehearsal taping earlier in the day of the Bash -- with Undertaker ad-libbing and only half of the stunt complete, in an empty arena -- was leaked onto the internet dirt sheets and actually broadcast live by accident in many of the TV markets. As he had two years remaining on his contract, however, Bearer was used as a booker for the company up until WWE decided to terminate his contract, giving him ninety day notice on April 11, 2005.", "title": "WWE undertaker Rehearsaling - wwe is fake", "publishedDate": "2010-11-06T04:23:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xjkAE4X07c", "description": "Pilobolus is a very unusual fungus found on animal dung.

The film opens with serial killer Brad Dourif taking refuge in a doll factory. Dourif is killed by the cops, but not before he has invoked a voodoo curse which transfers his soul into one of the dolls. That particular doll, nicknamed Chuckie, is unwittingly purchased by Catherine Hicks for her son Alex Vincent. Several murders occur shortly thereafter; all evidence points to Alex, who insists that his cherub-faced doll is responsible. Detective Chris Sarandon, the man responsible for Dourif's death, doesn't swallow Alex's story, but he agrees to investigate because he's sweet on Alex's mom. The slasher-flick ending of Child's Play would seem to have settled Chuckie's hash for good and all, but guess again--the film spawned numerous sequels.\n\n\"child's play\",\"child's play clip\",\"child's play full movie\",\"child's play 3\",\"child's play trailer\",\"child's play 2 full movie\",\"child's play 3 full movie\",\"child's play 2 trailer\",\"child's play remake\",\"child's play 1\",\"laura moskowitz\",horror,\"tom holland\",\"david kirschner\",\"elliot geisinger\",\"evil videos\",\"barrie m osborne\",\"mike norris\",\"chris sarandon\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"knife videos\",\"car videos\",\"cult horror\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9230,/m/021b5", "title": "Child's Play (6/12) Movie CLIP - You Can't Hurt Me (1988) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T00:40:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xl4L-6OF_A", "description": "http://www.facebook.com/PuppetandPuff", "title": "Puppet and Puff!

In short, if you have frown lines, your brain is telling you that you are not happy!\n\n\n\n\nShortest Cut To Mental and Physical Happiness\nOne of the reasons I believe in smiling is smiling makes you \"happy\" even when you are not!  Your brain notices you when you are smiling. Your eyebrows are relaxed and your brain \"thinks\" you are happy. \n\nLet your eye brow muscles relax by contracting/resisting and exercising your eye brow muscles. By doing this you can improve your blood circulation in the eye brows so that not only can you prevent, decrease and diminish lines but you will look happier and younger!\n\nYour face is the first thing that people notice when they meet you.  When you are stressed and unhappy, it shows in your face.  When you are happy and content, it shows in your face.\n\nIn this video \" Frown Line Exercise 2, \" you will use your fingers and contract/resist and exercise the eye brow muscles.\n \nYou can combine the last week's exercise with this for the best result. \nhttp://faceyogamethod.com", "title": "How To Get Rid of Frown Lines Naturally - Part 2", "publishedDate": "2013-07-03T04:09:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5xpvEuOxyxE", "description": "You\u2019ve never heard \u201cI love you\u201d like this before.\n\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/18yCF0b\n\n--------------------------\n\nAll Media Courtesy of AFV\n\nMUSIC\n\nHappy People\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nwww.buzzfeed.com\nwww.buzzfeed.com/video\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeed\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedvideo\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedyellow\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedpop\nwww.youtube.com/buzzfeedblue\nwww.youtube.com/cnnbuzzfeed\n\nBUZZFEED VIDEO\nBuzzFeed is the world's first true social news organization.

The processed iron ore sand is transported into secondary crusher, in which iron ore sand are get crushed into fine iron ore sand, by belt conveyor. We usually use impact crusher, jaw crusher and cone crusher as secondary crusher. In the next tertiary crushing step, iron ore sand gets produced into iron ore powder in the tertiary crushers, which are usually cone crushers.

We've been sharing things for thousands of years. With neighbours lending each other food, borrowing tools and allowing friends to stay whenever they needed a place to crash. This isn't a new thing and with new technology, the sharing economy is enabling this human trait to grow and enable both local and international transactions. Today, there are thousands of sharing economy websites which will give you the option to share...well, almost anything.\n\nFor example, say you have a spare room for a week which you'd like to rent out? Or maybe you need to travel across country? The sharing economy means you can see who else from your city is making the same journey and grab a ride! \n\nIt's not all about the money! Many of the transactions that pass through the sharing economy do so without cash ever changing hands. After all, the more we spend, the more we consume and the more we waste. Mankind's obsession with ownership appears to be at a tipping point and the sharing economy is perhaps the beginning of the antidote.\n\nIn 2013 alone, the UK benefitted from \u00a34.6 billion pounds of savings and earnings from the sharing economy and this is only set to grow.\n\nSo the next time you have a room going spare, an empty seat in your car or a talent you think others could benefit from, if you chose to share it then you'll be adding to this new and vibrant economy.\n\nTo find out more, check out: http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/in-focus-understanding-the-sharing-economy\n\nAll figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc.  Total sample size was 2,371 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 12th - 13th June 2014.  The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults (aged 18+).", "title": "What is the sharing economy?", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T09:51:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y37TGfgflA", "description": "\u5927\u54e5 \u4f60\u8b1b\u7684\u5be6\u5728\u592a\u8b9a\u4e86 \n\n\u4e0d\u7ffb\u8b6f\u767d\u4e0d\u7ffb~!\n\n\u539f\u59cb\u7db2\u7ad9~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tM3sBsb0wc&feature=plcp\n\n\u6211\u767c\u73fe\u6211\u4f73 \u6253\u932f\u4e86@@\"\n\n\u5982\u9084\u6709\u7ffb\u8b6f\u932f\u8aa4\u7684\u5730\u65b9 \u8acb\u9ebb\u7169\u901a\u77e5\u4e00\u4e0b~", "title": "FBI \u9127\u4f73\u83ef \u5225\u518d\u6c59\u67d3 YOUTUBE\u4e86 (\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u5e55\u7248)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-10T13:50:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y3CBnQzYmY", "description": "NEWS: http://www.kurir-info.rs/\nGRAND NARODNA TELEVIZIJA ZA CEO SVET\nNET TV Plus https://www.nettvplus.com\n\nSatelit: Eutelsat 16A\nFrekvencija: 10972 MHz\nPolarizacija: Vertikalna\nSR: 27500\nFEC: 5/6\nSID: 1306\n\nSrbija:\nAnalogna\nSBB -- svi gradovi\nKDS\nJET TV\nDigitalna - Pozicija 211\nD3\nBeogrid\nD3i\nD3Go\nTotal TV - Pozicija 11\n\nHrvatska:\nTotal TV\n\nBosna i Hercegovina:\nTelemach\nTotal Tv - Pozicija 9\n\nSlovenija:\nTelemach\nTotal Tv - Pozicija 104\n\nCrna Gora:\nTotal Tv - Pozicija 8\n\nMakedonija:\nTotal Tv - Pozicija 10\n\nLabel & Copyright: Grand Production\nZvezde Granda Management : +381 65 88 22 595\n\nZabranjeno svako kopiranje video i/ili audio snimaka i\npostavljanje na druge kanale! http://goo.gl/QO9zkl http://mosalsalatii.blogspot.com/\n\n    Category\n        Entertainment\n    Licence\n        Standard YouTube Licence", "title": "Milan Mitrovi\u0107 - Ne\u0107u da me starost pita (Grand Show 23.03.2012)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T22:25:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y3FykvrNgE", "description": "http://www.VanishEczema.net Get expert advice on the different treatments that control the condition eczema http://www.VanishEczema.net\nEczema is a chronic, non-contagious skin condition with various manifestations, and as such is known by many names. Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation. The herbal ingredients that may be used include virgin coconut oil, blueberry leaves, mashed papaya seeds, licorice, dandelion leaves, turmeric powder, bitter neem leaves, chamomile, camphor, aloe vera, spearmint leaves, witch hazel and nutmeg. \n\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\neczema\nAlternative treatments\ntreatments\nmoisturisers\nmoisturising soap substitutes\nitching\nscratching\nbarrier function\ntopical corticosteroids\ninflammation\nflare-ups of eczema\nInflammation\ndry skin\nLichenification\nantimicrobial medicines\ninfection\nimmunosuppressant medicines\nGamolenic acid\nevening primros extract\nTraditional Chinese herbal medicines\nChinese medicine\nUVB light therapy\nPUVA\npsoralen", "title": "Natural Treatment For Eczema", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T13:32:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y3TQ2SMuc4", "description": "icim bos kaldi cok yandi canim, artik ne yapsam yalnizlardanim\nicim gul biraz guldur biraz, onu oldur kendini guldur biraz", "title": "Nil Karaibrahimgil Yaln\u0131zlardan\u0131m 15 Mart 2009 Seffaf Oda", "publishedDate": "2009-07-29T02:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y3cdoMCGdM", "description": "esta son las pallas de huanuco de obas creo ,,,subido en  madrid", "title": "LOS SUPER BRILLANTES DEL ANDECON LAS PALLAS DE HUANUCO ES HERMOS", "publishedDate": "2011-11-07T16:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5y3qltIzXw4", "description": "M\u00e9tete de cabeza en la Nube con los auriculares HyperX Cloud y juega sin sentirlos.

Molen, Robert Raymond, Lew Rywin, Steven Spielberg\nScreenwriter: Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian\nFilm Description: Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.\n\n\"schindler's list\",\"schindler's list clip\",\"schindler's list theme\",\"schindler's list trailer\",\"liam neeson\",\"bed videos\",\"gun videos\",\"machine gun videos\",\"piano videos\",\"towel videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",biography,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"inspirational stories\",\"military war dramas\",\"period pieces\",\"steven spielberg\",\"kathleen kennedy\",\"gerald r molen\",\"branko lustig\",\"lew rywin\",\"irving glovin\",\"robert raymond\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++119912,/m/0h5g_", "title": "Schindler's List (4/9) Movie CLIP - Bach or Mozart?

The premiere in question will see the time-honoured Milanese coachbuilder Zagato team up w\u00eeth BMW to unveil the result of a unique collaboration: the BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9.\n \nZagato has worked in close collaboration to create an exciting and emotionally charged coup\u00e9 in the finest tradition of automotive workmanship. The BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9 embodies the unbridled fascination of cars and fuses the design DNA of the two companies into a fresh and desinctive whole. This one-off model is the product of many hours of skilled hand-craftsmanship and breathes new life into the tradition of coachbuilding.\n \nIt is hard to think of a better occasion for the premiere than the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, one of the most exclusive events in the world of classic cars and motorcycles. The vehicles shown on the banks of Lake Como are hand-picked, the number of entrants limited and the surroundings simply without comparison. The Concorso began as a get-together of coachbuilders presenting one-off hand-built creations, and the BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9 follows very much in that tradition.\n\nMade for the road.\nThe two partners settled on a realistic and applied approach to the development of the BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9. 'Zagato has always provided its customers w\u00eeth ready-to-drive cars which can be sent into action on the road or race track without further ado -- and the BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9 fits the same template,' says Dr Andrea Zagato, who represents the third generation of his family to sit at the helm of the company. To this end, the car is registered for road use and meets all the legal requirements worldwide. 'It is relatively easy to build a design study which is not intended for use on the road. Not having to meet any stipulations governing crash safety or pedestrian protection opens up a host of new avenues in terms of design,' he adds. 'The challenge lies in injecting the emotional appeal of a concept car into a road-legal machine. And we think we have succeeded in doing just that w\u00eeth the BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9.' Indeed, the new creation has already cut a 'bella figura' at high speeds during testing on the BMW test track.\n \nBoth partners can look back on a rich heritage, sharing as they do a passion for cars that stretches back over 80 years. Added to which, Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice-President BMW Group Design, and Andrea Zagato are long-time appreciators of each other's work; indeed, Zagato took home the prestigious Concorso d'Eleganza Design Award in both 2010 and 2011. However, this collaboration is about more than mutual respect.\n \nZagato chief designer Norihiko Harada and van Hooydonk have been friends for many years, so when Andrea Zagato proposed a collaboration, it wasn't long before the decision was made to build a car at Zagato that embodies the two companies' passion for cars.", "title": "2012 BMW Zagato Coup\u00e9 news, pictures, and information", "publishedDate": "2012-05-27T00:52:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ylugoQo7uY", "description": "Unboxing and review of New York Comic Con 2013 exclusive Phil Coulson S.H.I.E.L.D. agent badge and ID card prop replica from Marvel's Agents of SHIELD by eFX Collectibles. by John Carlos McMaster.\nFollow me on: www.Facebook.com/JohnCarlosMcMaster\nwww.Twitter.com/JCMcMaster  @JCMcMaster\nwww.Instagram.com/JohnCarlosMcMaster  JohnCarlosMcMaster", "title": "eFX Phil Coulson S.H.I.E.L.D. agent badge replica review - NYCC exclusive", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T17:21:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ym1MCX7MK0", "description": "\"Shrub\" commercial for internet service in USA.", "title": "Webvet: Shrub", "publishedDate": "2009-07-21T14:32:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ymL0pXowEY", "description": "Axe To Grind by TAD", "title": "Tad - Axe To Grind", "publishedDate": "2009-05-19T01:14:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ymq19B2NEY", "description": "Alscribjiani: A Free Fantasy in Three Movements (2006)\n\nI Rapidum Balisticum\n\nClint Tibbs, piano\n\nAccording to Tibbs:\n\n\"The form of [Alscribjiani] and certain thematic elements were preconceived, but the execution of most of the content was 'made up on the spot.' Preconceived ideas came together at the moment they were played, mixed with many moments of an improvised nature. None of this music was composed with pen and staff paper. It only exists in this recording and in the mind of the performer.\n\n[Alscribjiani] was influenced by Alkan, Scriabin, and Sorabji. Sorabji was influenced by Alkan and Scriabin; an all the more fitting reason for such an amalgam of a title. The listener will notice that the greatest influence is from Sorabji not only in the music but also in the names of the first and second movements. Alscribjiani is also influenced by the music of two equally important and innovative Russian composer-pianists, namely, Nikolai Roslavets and Samuel Feinberg.\n\nWhile there is no discernable tonal center for Alscribjiani, the music tends to wander around in D minor, C-flat major, B-flat minor, D-flat major, and G-flat major (and maybe other keys). The music is asymmetrical and does not conform to the symmetry of traditional 'classical' music; influences extend far beyond the range of traditional classical music. Thematic material exists in three forms: melodic themes, rhythmic themes, and textural themes; themes that are stated, developed, and interwoven to form a single tapestry throughout the entire piece.\n\nAll three movements are related through a similar soundscape that binds the piece together; tonality and atonality are blended to form a seamless 'impressionistic' sound without falling into total atonal abstraction and oblivion. The dissonant seconds and grace notes are played intentionally in chords and scales and are not mere 'mistakes.' They are meant to contribute to the overall ornamental effect of the music not unlike the effect of Sorabji's ornate music. Despite the duration of Alscribjiani, it is meant to be heard in one sitting.\n\nThe opening of the first movement, Rapidum Balisticum, mimics the opening of Scriabin's 7th sonata, 'White Mass.' The movement exhibits the kind of restlessness that Nikolai Medtner depicts in his Sonata Minacciosa in F minor, with hints of impressions from Ives' Concord Sonata and possibly from Copland's Piano Variations.\"", "title": "Tibbs - Alscribjiani; I Rapidum Balisticum (Part 2/2)", "publishedDate": "2009-06-25T04:13:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ymvT6p6I-s", "description": "Feux d'artifice Amateur.

Early spring shoots were eaten. Medically it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to stop bleeding and treat kidney ailments, ulcers, and tuberculosis, and by the ancient Chinese to treat superficial visual obstructions. Rootstocks and stems are sometimes eaten by waterfowl.

The Jambox has more sparkling treble, but overall disappoints soundwise.

Otters have been found in the brackish waters below sea level in the Netherlands, up to 1,000 m and more in the Alps or the Pyrenees, and above 3,500 m in the Himalayas or 4,120 m in Tibet. \nThe Eurasian otter avoids deep water. Their distribution in coastal areas, especially the location of holts, is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater.\nOtters are often described as playful and have been observed sliding down mudbanks or snowdrifts on their bellies. Both juvenile and adult L. lutra play, trot, gallop, slide, and chase each other in water. This behavior is thought to help young otters perfect their hunting techniques.\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tvgreen  \nFollow us on Pinterest:\n  http://pinterest.com/faunafilm/\n  http://pinterest.com/stockshot/\n  http://pinterest.com/dreamshot/\nPlease subscribe, share & comment us on YouTube:\n  http://www.youtube.com/dreamshot\n  http://www.youtube.com/screenshot\n  http://www.youtube.com/tvgreenmagazine\n  http://www.youtube.com/stockshot", "title": "fish otter - Europese visotter - lutra lutra", "publishedDate": "2012-09-06T17:15:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "5z-QEENVdkc", "description": "Amy Woltman discusses several examples of the weaves, knits, and braidings that Secant Medical is capable of producing for medical device applications, while Joannie Anthony provides some brief insights on the company.
