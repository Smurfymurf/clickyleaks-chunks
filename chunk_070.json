With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has a single proton and zero neutrons.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Hydrogen", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T23:58:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NGROhV7Hew", "description": "***** FORMATIONS ACC\u00c9L\u00c9R\u00c9ES CERTIFIANTES****\n************ BEAUT\u00c9, ONGLERIE & BIEN \u00caTRE*********\n\n\u00c9COLE JASMIN organise :\n\n- Formations acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9es en Esth\u00e9tique : massages, soins visages, Soins corps, Soins mains et pieds, \u00c9pilation, Maquillage et Maquillage artistique.\n\n- Formations acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9es en Pose faux ongles Gel, Acrogel, French permanent ou R\u00e9sine.\n\n_ Formations acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9es en Coiffure : Coupes, Chignons, m\u00e8che papier, K\u00e9ratine.\n\nVeuillez contacter :\n\nECOLE JASMIN\nAdresse : 2, Rue D'Espagne, 1001, Tunis, TUNISIE\nTel : 00216 22 95 14 39 ou 00216 95 96 38 21\nMail : formation@ecolejasmin.com\nwww.ecolejasmin.com\n\nDevenir FUN ECOLE JASMIN : https://www.facebook.com/Ecole.Jasmin.Tunis", "title": "ECOLE JASMIN TUNIS  Formation acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e et continue maquillage, esth\u00e9tique, coiffure et faux ongles", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T12:01:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NGpV2FGgXc", "description": "http://www.kba.com/en/web-offset/newspaper-presses/product/comander-62/detail/", "title": "Commander 6/2 Superstructure/folder", "publishedDate": "2010-09-01T07:35:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NIBRlmUuH8", "description": "Track: Chrysolite\nAlbum: Crucible\nArtist: City of the Fallen", "title": "City of The Fallen - Chrysolite", "publishedDate": "2012-03-25T13:42:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NIKTCd0sbE", "description": "", "title": "cooking fried chicken", "publishedDate": "2013-06-09T05:16:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NIMjIRYWr0", "description": "Artist - Conniving Kids\nSong - Damn Ecdysiast\nAlbum - Map Read East", "title": "Conniving Kids - Damn Ecdysiast (Official Lyric Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-06T15:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NIbi0zMcSU", "description": "", "title": "Jump kill FTW!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T19:33:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NImL0ZX3_s", "description": "Keep oil, grease and road grime from robbing your engine of its best performance.

Typically, fouling is progressive, and if not controlled early, will impair the RO membrane element performance in a relatively short time. Cleaning should occur when the RO shows evidence of fouling, just prior to a long-term shutdown, or as a matter of scheduled routine maintenance. The elements shall be maintained in a clean or \"nearly clean\" condition to prevent excessive fouling by the foulants listed above. \n\n\u2022Reverse Osmosis System (RO)\n\u2022Sea Water Desalination System\n\u2022Water Softening System\n\u2022Ultra Filtration System\n\u2022De-Ionization System (DI)\n\u2022Distillation System\n\u2022Mineral Water Plant\n\u2022Activated Carbon System\n\u2022Cartridge Filtration\n\u2022Sand Filtration System\n\u2022Ozonator and Systems\n\u2022Ultra Violet System\n\u2022Waste Water Treatment\n\u2022Re-cycling Plant\n\u2022Sewage Water Treatment\n\u2022Pure Water Storage\n\u2022Commercial and Domestic Purification\n\u2022Distribution System\n\u2022R.

Many of those were from the victims' sector.\n\n\"I think it's interesting that republicans and some elements of the media are singling on one particular consultee and trying to suggest that this proves that unionists are being led by the nose.\"\n\nOn Monday, Dr Haass and Prof O'Sullivan published a two-page summary of their blueprint.\n\nIn it, they said the implementation of their proposals \"would leave the people of Northern Ireland considerably better off than they are today by tackling the difficult issues that continue to divide society\".\n\n\"It is the product of work informed by a sense of urgency given the tension and violence of the past year and the need to contend with the past before the passage of time makes this even more difficult,\" they said.\n\n\"It is not self-implementing, but requires approval, resources, and support for implementation in Northern Ireland and, for certain elements, in Westminster and elsewhere.\"", "title": "BBC News - UUP Haass rejection shows disdain says Alliance Party", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T08:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NPi6qVT-_k", "description": "This is a taste test/review of the new Hormel Sandwich Makers Chicken In Marinara Sauce.

Restoration involves pumping sand back into the voided area, creating a protective fill. \n\n\"Once the property owner's work is completed, we can begin to repair the roadway.  Unfortunately, we cannot begin the road repairs until the ground surrounding the road's right of way is stabilized,\" explained MacAdam.\n\nEngineers anticipate a late spring or early summer road reopening. \n\nTraffic will continue to be detoured on SR 39 and SR 93. Beginning at the intersection of SR 39 and SR 516 in Dover, traffic is being rerouted west on SR 39 to SR 93 in Sugarcreek, then north on SR 93 back to SR 516 in Dundee, and reverse.\n\nThe CELESTIAL Convergence | http://thecelestialconvergence.blogspot.com/\n\nThe CELESTIAL Convergence is a online news magazine featuring Alien Disclosure, the ET/UFO Phenomena, Earth Changes, the Paranormal, and Geological Upheavals.\n\nThis is a journey of truth, and the highlighting of clear patterns of cause and effect in the electromagnetic celestial convergence of our solar system with the Sirius star system, and the manifested transmutation with the Galactic Core of our Central Sun, Alcyone - Hunab Ku. \n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: These pages/video may contain copyrighted (\u00a9 ) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

The architecture of this work is a balance between to pictorially dominant maps. The first map, which occupies the entire picture plain, is yellow and red. This exercise in spacial dissemination is an extract from a map which illustrates the proliferation of flowering plants from their origin in the Sth American/African rift valley through Gondwana and finally into Australia. The second map is circular. It displays southern continents as they are today. The light yellow areas mark out the current locations of Antarctic Beech (Nothofagus). These trees were once widespread throughout. It is believed that it once grew on the Main Range. The faint silhouette behind much of this work is a canopy shot from a forest dominated by Nothofagus. The bottom right corner displays an image of the giant temnospondyl amphibian Koolasuchus which lived from about 137-112 million years ago. Its kind was once widespread around the globe but due to competition from crocodiles they were restricted to the South Polar Regions of which Australia was then a part. As the climate cooled they became extinct. The top middle section of the work features a scan of the flowering part of a flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolius). The diagram directly above this displays the bio-mass of various groups of animals through time. To the left of this is a map that marks out the volcanoes of Toowoomba. The map in the square to the right illustrates the topography of the landscape between Toowoomba and Brisbane. The map in the top right corner illustrates the structural elements of South East Queensland. To its left is a map showing some of East Queensland?s volcanoes. Numbers indicate the age of the volcanoes.\n\nAcknowledgements: Maps sourced from The Greening of Gondwana by Mary White and The Geology of Australia by David Johnson.

This time in HD! XD \n\nSo I'm back with another frostiron vid, this time it's a bit short cause I'm slightly out of inspirational juice for this pairing (I know, its absolutely terrifying. It's mostly because Doctor Who is back and I'm itching to finish my Part II of WhoLock and Eternity of a Day (the fickleness of my extremely unreliable muse, le sigh.\nThis is the link to my Wholock vid if you're interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z55I-CD81E)\n\nANYWAYS, this is a vid inspired by many fics featuring our lovely pair sharing a moment together after Loki's true heritage is revealed to Tony. :P \nPlease see mini summary below for more info!\n\n| | |\n\nSUMMARY\n\nLoki and Tony have a row with each other, mostly due to Loki's hidden doubts about how Tony truly feels about him. He pushes Tony away because he assumes that no mortal will ever be able to truly love him for what he is beneath the illusions. His inner thoughts, that one that had been hurt perviously and is also the voice that leads Loki to destroy, mocks him for his weaknesses.\n\nLoki's emotions get the best of him however and his illusion breaks, causing Tony to see the God of Mischief's true form. \nInstead of rejecting him though, Tony walks closer to Loki's side, unafraid and filled with understanding now. (Because he thought Loki had pushed him away due to the fact that he would never BE like Loki, like an immortal.) \n\nLoki's illusionary form comes back to him as he realizes that Tony does not fear him.\n\n//\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\"You lie.\" - Loki\n\"What did you just say?\" - Tony\n\"It all makes sense NOW! No matter how much you CLAIM to LOVE ME!\" - Loki\n\"You done?\" - Tony\n\"It's surprising... I'm NOT so surprised. I get it... you don't have to make any more excuses.\"\n\n\"Never doubt that I love you...\" - Loki (flashback scene)\n\n\"Sentiment. This is the basis of sentimentality. This is a child's prayer... Pathetic!\" - Loki's alter ego thoughts\n\n\"I'm cursed.\" - Loki\n\"You've made it personal.\" - Tony\n\n| | |\n\nCREDIT\nWritten at the end of the video! :)\n\nDISCLAIMER: I OWN NOTHING!", "title": "Cursed || Frostiron // Tony&Loki (Short AU)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-22T02:29:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NQCNAIoLy4", "description": "Crispy, yummy brownie crisps :)\nBrownie playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhvHiBS6HlGuWFngNVwRSK1BMBWyeFOn\n\n1/2 cup butter\n1 egg\n1 oz unsweetened or semi sweet chocolate\n1/4 tsp vanilla\n1 tsp instant coffee\n1/4 tsp salt (omit if using salted butter)\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1/2 cup finely chopped nuts (your choice)\n\nMelt the butter and chocolate together in the microwave or on low heat on the stove.\nStir until smooth.\nStir in the instant coffee\nStir in the sugar, egg and vanilla.\nMix in the flour and salt until smooth.\n\nPour batter in a 15x10\" greased pan, spread batter out until it is even and very thin.

Turkey fears of Islamic challenge to secular state\n\n(RT's Maria Finoshina's report.)\n\nTurkish top pianist Fazil Say received a suspended 10-month jail term on Monday for mocking Islam on Twitter. Secular Turks have become increasingly concerned over what they see as the creeping Islamization of society.\n\nThe blasphemy charges were brought against Fazil Say in June last year. In their suit, prosecutors cited several sarcastic messages about believers and Islamic concepts of Heaven. The musician, who has served as a cultural ambassador to the European Union, denied the accusations.\n\nRT's Maria Finoshina reported from Turkey how residents are concerned by the growing dominance of Islamic values: Censorship is imposed on TV shows, museums are turned into mosques, and attempts are even being made to introduce Ottoman-style uniforms for flight attendants.\n\nTurkish women fear their rights are being infringed even though they are seemingly free to wear and do what they want.\n\n\"The reformed education system is split into three parts of four years each, the result - thousands of girls leave school before the end, encouraging young marriages. The state promotes having at least five kids. Only three out of ten women today go to work. It's far from a democratic model of society,\" says \u015eenal Sarihan, the head of the group Women of the Republic.  \n\nThe Turkish opposition speaks of a dangerous tendency: nine decades after Turkey broke with the Islamic rule of the Ottoman Empire in favor of an anti-clerical, pro-Western vision, the ideas and values that were rejected appear to some to be making a comeback.\n\n\"We are very concerned because Turkey is a secular democracy. But Islam has become the only reference. It says what to do, what to wear, what to eat, what not to eat,\" Faruk Logoglu, CHP party vice-chairman said.\n\nLink to the original article: http | //rt.com/news/islam-challenges-secular-turkey-861/\n*\nFollow Occupy Turkiye (Turkey) on Facebook | http://fb.com/occupyTurkiye", "title": "Turkey fears of Islamic challenge to secular state", "publishedDate": "2013-04-15T21:02:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NU-x9z4TB8", "description": "FOI MUITA UN\u00c7AO", "title": "6 VIGILIA PENTECOSTAL ' COLUNA DE FOGO'", "publishedDate": "2008-11-02T16:40:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NU3r-fem6w", "description": "This can be done with the dish and bracket attached, however I have not been able to do it without unbolting the dish from the bracket first.", "title": "Ubiquiti NanoBridge InnerFeed removal", "publishedDate": "2010-04-09T21:47:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NU6ZDU74As", "description": "http://www.DoItYourSelfBuilder.com Video Project Tilted: Roofing With The Pros this is 3 of 6 videos samples taken from the full 60 min video.

The use of the term \"human evolution\" in the title is ambiguous. When the anthropologist says \"human\", what he has in mind is essentially any bipedal primates. So this would include hominids living as far back as 7 million years ago. On the other hand, when Muslims say \"human\" they have something different in mind- they mean modern humans, or Homo sapiens sapiens- which arrived on the scene around (roughly) 70,000-125,000 years ago, as genetic and archaeological data suggests. Therefore, this article doesn't really have anything to do with \"human\" evolution, rather evolution of animals that looked somewhat like humans.

Precisa cirug\u00eda correctora de la conicidad glandular mediante la t\u00e9cnica de 4 colgajos del Dr. Nogueira, resecci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea periareolar para tratar la hernia areolar y descenso del surco submamario para recuperar el territorio mamario ocupado por el abdomen; para reconstruir el polo inferior se usar\u00e1n implantes anat\u00f3micos cubiertos de poliuretano modelo Biodesign Natural del fabricante Silimed; el plano de colocaci\u00f3n es subfascial, lo cual minimiza la agresividad, reduce los riesgos y favorece una mejor recuperaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s de la tuberosidad se asocia una asimetr\u00eda mamaria compleja no reparable, susceptible \u00fanicamente de tratamiento paliativo mediante el empleo de implantes de diferente proyecci\u00f3n. Se usan implantes anat\u00f3micos por su superioridad est\u00e9tica.\nAl ganar el terreno abdominal para reconstruir el polo inferior nos encontramos con que una gran parte del implante mamario est\u00e1 cubierto por piel abdominal dura, inel\u00e1stica y con memoria de forma para estar adherida a la pared t\u00f3raco-abdominal y formar concavidad; ahora dicha piel pasar\u00e1 a ser mamaria y de forma convexa adapt\u00e1ndose a la forma del implante. Por lo tanto el implante mamario se ver\u00e1 sometido a fuerzas compresivas ascendentes por parte de la piel abdominal ganada, las cuales intentan expulsar el implante en sentido cef\u00e1lico o ascendente dado que la piel tiene memoria e intenta volver a contactar con la pared t\u00f3raco-abdominal. Dicha presi\u00f3n, que va a estar presente en el postoperatorio durante 4 a 6 meses,  puede dislocar y malposicionar al implante obligando a una o varias reintervenciones para recolocar las pr\u00f3tesis. \nEl implante n\u00ba 1 indiscutible en cuanto a adherencia a tejidos y resistencia al desplazamiento es el implante cubierto de poliuretano. Los implantes de baja adherencia a tejidos tienen un 30-50% de reintervenci\u00f3n por migraci\u00f3n cuando se usan en mamas tuberosas, los de alta adherencia un 10-30% y los de cubierta de poliuretano tienen tan solo 0-1% de migraciones por empuje cut\u00e1neo en mamas tuberosas, raz\u00f3n que los hace pr\u00e1cticamente imprescindibles dentro del arsenal t\u00e9cnico del cirujano que maneja mamas tuberosas por su fijacion tanto mec\u00e1nica (superficie \u00e1spera adherente) como biol\u00f3gica (el tejido capsular de la paciente penetra en la espuma reticulada de la cubierta de poliuretano creando efecto velcro). \nhttp://www.AlejandroNogueira.com\n\nVII Final result\nPatient suffering congenital syndrome of tuberous breasts or tubular breasts, with severe conicity, significant elevation of submammary fold and irreducible areolar herniation. Requires surgical correction of glandular conicity by using Dr. Nogueira\u2019s 4 flaps technique, periareolar skin resection to treat areolar herniation and submammary fold descent to regain the mammary territory occupied by the abdomen; to reconstruct the lower pole Silimed manufacturer model Natural Biodesign polyurethane coated anatomical implants will be used; the placement plane is subfascial, which minimizes aggressiveness, reduces risks and favors a better recovery. \nBesides tuberosity a non-repairable complex breast asymmetry is associated, likely only of palliative treatment by using different projection implants. Anatomical implants are used for their aesthetic superiority. \nBy gaining the abdominal territory to reconstruct the lower pole we find that much of the breast implant is covered by hard, inelastic abdominal skin with shape memory to be attached to the thoraco-abdominal wall and form concavity; now that skin becomes mammary and conforming convex adapting to the shape of the implant. Therefore the breast implant will be subjected to ascending compressive forces by the gained abdominal skin, which tries to drive the implant cephalad or upwards since the skin has memory and tries to reconnect with the thoraco-abdominal wall. This pressure, which will be present for 4-6 months postoperatively, can dislocate and malposition the implant forcing to one or more reoperations to reposition the prosthesis. \nThe undisputed #1 implant for adherence to tissues and displacemente resistance is the polyurethane coated implant. Low tissue adherence implants have 30-50% reoperations due to migration when used in tuberous breasts, high adherence ones have 10-30% and polyurethane coated implants show as low as 0-1% migration rate due to skin push when used in tuberous breasts, that makes them virtually indispensable in the technical arsenal of the surgeon managing tuberous breasts due to their mechanical (rough surface adherence) and biological (the capsular tissue of the patient penetrates the reticulated foam polyurethane coating creating velcro effect) fixation.\nhttp://www.AlejandroNogueira.com", "title": "Mamas tuberosas implante poliuretano subfascial(VII)Tuberous breasts subfascial polyurethane implant", "publishedDate": "2014-10-15T22:32:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NeMgCNP4gY", "description": "Charming unique character home in the heart of downtown Enderby. 3 bdrm up, 2 down, 1 bath, mud room, breakfast bar, spacious and some nice updates done.

E Rawrk is a side project by Leigh C (Exxon Valdez, The Gruesome Twosome, Yo Han Garfunkel & The Caribou Kid) and C.F.Meister (Exxon Valdez, Yo Han Garfunkel & The Caribou Kid, Speech Impediment). The project came together when Leigh and Meister heard the Death Grips \"Exmilitary\" release and were inspired to make a mixtape in the same vein. \n\n\"Mickstape\" was produced, written and record within the space of 2 weeks. The 29 tracks capture Leighs raw crass lyrics (the majority recorded in Meisters garden shed) over Meisters uncouth throwaway beats (recorded straight from his MPC) resulting in an amalgamation of unpolished energy, creativeness and ignorance. \n\nThe cover (designed by Hello Newman) is a homage to Tom Waits - Rain Dogs, The Clash - London Burning (via Elvis Presleys self titled album) and of course a tribute to Mickey Rourke. \n\n\nYou can find more free music releases, music videos and upcoming events on the Loud Mouth Collectives blog - http://loudmouthonline.blogspot.ie/", "title": "Mick E.

The Archway Rack is equipped with Thule's Quick-Fit lever system, which allows for easy adjustment and the perfect fit. Thule's Cinch-Lever mechanism provides the unique ability to adjust each bike support arm independently for a better fit with non-traditional bike frames. Thule's new Hold Fast anti-sway cradles with Road Dampening Technology (RDT) are designed for use with all bike frames including carbon-frames. The RDT cradle design is equipped with thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) making the Archway cradle design unique.

The cradles also include SoftTouch Anti-Sway Cages which help provide extra stability, protection and prevent bike-to-bike contact.

Die Bl\u00fcten dieser Pflanzen \u00f6ffnen sich am Morgen und schlie\u00dfen sich bereits am Nachmittag. Ihr Aussehen erinnert dann entfernt an einen Bocksbart. Die hellbraunen Wurzeln des Wiesenbocksbartes wurden fr\u00fcher als Nahrungsmittel verwendet. Sie eignen sich f\u00fcr zahlreiche delikate Gerichte. Das Kochwasser sollte nicht weggesch\u00fcttet werden, es ist eine gute Grundlage f\u00fcr Suppen und Br\u00fchen.\n\nDie Sch\u00f6sslinge des Wiesenbocksbartes werden wie Spargel, die Bl\u00e4tter wie Spinat oder aber als Salat zubereitet. Der Geschmack \u00e4hnelt dem dem Endiviensalat oder dem Chicor\u00e9e \u00e4hnelt. Das Mark der St\u00e4ngel und der s\u00fc\u00dflich schmeckende St\u00e4ngel an sich k\u00f6nnen roh verzehrt werden. Der Anbau des Wiesenbocksbartes kann bis auf das Jahr 1500 zur\u00fcckverfolgt werden. Als Gem\u00fcse wurde diese Heilpflanze jedoch im Laufe der Zeit von der Gartenschwarzwurzel verdr\u00e4ngt. Wiesenbocksbart wirkt blutreinigend, harn- und schwei\u00dftreibend.\n\nJe nach Standort wird der zweij\u00e4hrige bis ausdauernde Wiesenbocksbart 30 bis 80 cm hoch. Die aufrecht wachsenden, einfach bis wenig verzweigten St\u00e4ngel dieser Pflanzen sind kahl. Die aus einem bauchigem, halbst\u00e4ngelumfassendem Grund herauswachsenden Bl\u00e4tter sind schmal, lanzettlich und lang zugespitzt. Die Bl\u00fctezeit des Wiesenbocksbartes liegt zwischen Mai und Juli. Die gro\u00dfen, gelben Bl\u00fctenk\u00f6pfe bilden sich einzeln auf den Stielen. Die Pfahlwurzeln dieser Pflanzen sind braun und enthalten viel wei\u00dfen Milchsaft. Wiesenbocksbart ist geruchlos, der Geschmack ist angenehm, ein wenig bitter. Das Mark der St\u00e4ngel hat einen leicht s\u00fc\u00dflichen Geschmack.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Wiesenbocksbart\n\nDer Wiesenbocksbart w\u00e4chst in Europa mit Ausnahme der s\u00fcdlichsten und der n\u00f6rdlichsten Gebiete.

Set in Baltimore in 1954 at the birth of rock & roll, the film features Johnny Depp as Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker. Depp is pure charisma as a juvenile delinquent with a permanent tear slithering down his cheek, a reminder of his state-executed parents. In the depths of his despair appears goody-goody girl Allison (Amy Locane), who has a sexual crush on Cry-Baby. But Allison's Pat Boone-like boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen E. Miller), the leader of the squares, is dead set against Cry-Baby and the rest of the juvenile delinquents and leads a revolt against them. In the resultant riot, the juvenile delinquents are blamed for the chaos, and Cry-Baby finds himself dispatched to reform school.\n\ncry-baby,\"cry-baby clip\",\"cry-baby trailer\",\"cry-baby part 1\",\"johnny depp\",\"amy locane\",\"traci lords\",\"ricki lake\",\"kim mcguire\",\"darren e burrows\",\"jonathan benya\",\"scout raskin\",\"kim webb\",\"john waters\",\"guitar videos\",\"panties videos\",\"saxophone videos\",\"underwear videos\",comedy,\"contemporary movie musicals\",\"cult comedies\",\"late night comedies\",musicals,\"spoofs and satire\",\"brian grazer\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++11681,/m/0838fc,/m/0jfx1,/m/01l793,/m/08m038,/m/018fyy", "title": "Cry-Baby (5/10) Movie CLIP - King Cry-Baby (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T09:38:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NziK0Fj5oY", "description": "Enemy A.I. get out of the \"Backblast\" angle.", "title": "GL4 Backblast Enemy A.I.", "publishedDate": "2010-02-15T11:45:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3NznHfkmPCM", "description": "Ook De Tamarisk in de Wijert doet mee en zet de buurt in bloei!

We have been playing Cajun music together for three years now, and our music is influenced by many of the Louisiana bands and artists from the past and present, including Dennis McGee, Amede Ardoin, the Balfa Brothers, Christine Balfa, Jesse Lege, the Pineleaf Boys, Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Ray Abshire, Bonsoir Catin, Feufollet, the Red Stick Ramblers, Beausoliel, Joe Hall, Ed Poullard, Cedric Watson, and everybody who ever played with Balfa Toujours.\n\nPeter Lynch is a violinmaker and fiddler from Manchester, Michigan. He also plays tit fer (triangle), which he says is sometimes his favorite instrument. Peter specializes in Cajun and Creole music and and sings in Cajun French. He has studied fiddling with many seasoned Louisiana musicians, and has played with several Cajun groups in the state.\n\nSteve Rohs is from Charlotte, Michigan. He has been studying different styles of roots music for almost 20 years. A flute, banjo, mandolin, and whistle player of Celtic music, he has, in the last decade, learned old time and Cajun traditions. In addition to Sel de Terre, he has played for contra and square dances throughout the state as a member of Asking for Trouble, and, locally near Lansing, performs with The Devil You Don't, which specializes in old time, old country, and Irish music. \n\nThis group will get you up dancing for sure. We play traditional Cajun music; driving 2-steps, beautiful waltzes and some bluesy Creole songs: what they call French music in Louisiana. We're a fiddle and a guitar making a whole lot of music! Allons Danser Sha! \n\nTo book Sel de terre see Peter Lynch on facebook or Sel de terre on the www.\n\nNo smoking, no alcohol, no cussing , no spittin', but smiling's fine.\n\nPlease park facing the buildings to the stop sign south, and across the street.

We suspect his tameness is a result by chance that he may have been either someone's (illegally kept) pet or was socialised with humans if he was rehabilitated before returning to the wild.   \n\nPinky's name was given because he has a very old injury that left him with a broken and  boneless pinky on his left front paw.  Any of the other raccoons who come near him won't even challenge him except for the very young naive kits, which he just ignores.  \n\nNOTE to commenters: Pinky lives in a region where there hasn't been a case of raccoon rabies for over 25 years which is tracked and verified by the State's Public Health Dept. \n\nFYI: Groups of raccoons use our terrace as part of their thoroughfare on their way to and from home. Pinky is just one out of a few out of a handful of raccoon families who enjoy stopping by to play and lounge on our large terrace. \n\nWe are fortunate to be able to observe a variety of wildlife since we reside next to a protected preserve where raccoons are one of the many animals consider it home. I photograph and make video recordings to identify each as well as study their behaviours. We hope you will also enjoy watching this video of the close encounter of our charming furry friends.\n\nPlease note that none of the raccoons are our pets thus please follow your local wildlife guidelines for the safety of humans and animal wildlife alike. \n\nAdditional note: I'm very well aware of the dangers of interacting with wild animals since I professionally work with a variety of dangerous wild species. No children nor pets are ever harmed, especially the wild animals captured in these videos. \n\n\u00a9 2012 Rio Fun Entertainment\nAll Rights Reserved\nCamera: iPhone 4S", "title": "Petting a Tame Wild Raccoon - Part 2", "publishedDate": "2012-12-10T06:32:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3OCuUNvQd7Y", "description": "-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

So, when I think about Belhar, it's not about the document that you are going to read but it's an account that people take of their encounter with God. That time we encountered God as the triune God from the Bible. The one who said, you know, I love you all. I make you all my children and out of that personal encounter with God it's kind of like God turned us around and he said, well, now since you've seen my face go to other people that I have called and be with them and walk with them into this world. Don't stay together just for being nice and enjoying one another.

Besides the biographical facts of his life the reel presents concrete formulas and practices that everyone can use in the everyday life for solving different problems. \n\n It has been shot in Sofia, Plovdiv, Karlovo, Stara Zagora, Sliven, Burgas, Madara and Varna. Besides his daughter Lili Dimkova, his grandson Petur Dimkov and lots of his former patients took place in the film. Archival frames and photos from the personal files of the Healer are used. There are also frames shot in the beginning of the 20th century till its end.\n\nThe film was broadcasted on the Bulgarian National Television and it generated 30 % share. \n\nThe film won awards for a striking and talented reproduction of the art of the life of the national healer:\n\nSecond international cinema festival \"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435\", Moscow\nEurasian TV competition \"\u042f - \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\", Orenburg\nTenth Euroasian TV forum Moscow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO IS PETUR DIMKOV?\n\nHe was born in Sofia on 19th December 1886 -- St. Nicolas day (OS). His father was a priest in St. Petka and St. Nedelya churches. His grandmother was a naturopath and she often dictated the little Petyo recipes. He was writing them down in a special notebook. During his life Petur Dimkov inscribed more than 10\u00a0000 recipes using over 300 types of herbs.\n\nIn 1900 Petur Dimkov enrolled at the Poltava Cadet Corps, which he graduated with honours. Then he studied in the St Petersburg's Military Academy which he graduated in 1909 also with honours. In Russia Dimkov met the work of the greatest Russian writers and the socio-political thinkers, which influence him to believe in \"the power of the human soul\". Just about 16 years old he was enchanted with Tolstoy's ideas and as a first step he became a vegetarian.\n\nIn July 1909 Petur Dimkov was enlisted in the Bulgarian army. He participated in the Balkan War, the Second Balkan War and the World War I. and along with the accoutrements he always brought with him the Bible. Dimkov firmly believed that God is inside us and there is no obstacle that hinders us to make connection with Him.\n\n\n\nPetur Dimkov was decorated with all the military orders that were given in Bulgaria. He was injured eight times. His words say: \"Respect yourself, have the faith in yourself. This is the best way to strike the others with respect and trust.\n\nThough the recantation of the ruling circles, they often asked for his help. Even the first leader of the communist world Leonid Brezhnev asked personally for his assistance. The meeting took place during one of the visits of the soviet leader. Dimkov gave him advice not to relay on the climate here -- Brezhnev was curing in Bankia. He had to search for a better treatment for his desease. \n\nThe daughter of the Bulgarian dictator Todor Zhivkov -- Liudmila Zhivkova, after a serious automobile accident, cured according to the prescriptions of Dimkov. After the treatment was over her headache disappeared completely, so did the scar on her forehead. Moreover, Liudmila was speaking for hours with the healer of Bulgaria. She began to take books from his personal library. She even called him: \" Father Petyo\". Petur Dimkov was more than a doctor, he became also a teacher of Liudmila. Influenced by him she was preparing a book about the Bogomilism. In July 1981 Liudmila Zhivkova unexpectedly died. A couple of months later, on 4th October 1981 Petur Dimkov suddenly died while he was sleeping.\n\nDuring his lifetime Dimkov had often met the celebrated Bulgarian prophet Vanga. Nobody witnesses their meetings.  During one of her stays in the Sofia hospitals Vanga infected Dimkov with virus pneumonia. The doctors saved him with great difficulties. During his long sickness the healer often lost consciousness.  Even in this condition, exhausted by the sickness, in semi-consciousness, he was trying to get up, to see and cure his patients. \n\nDimkov has met the teacher of Bulgaria Petur Dunov numerous times in his life. He became one of his followers. He respects and reveres all the messengers of the White lodge, the Universal White Brotherhood that have come to bring the humanity knowledge for the divine truth.\n\n\nThe Director: Stilyan Ivanov is also the author of the film. He graduated The National Academy for Theatrical and Cinema Arts, Sofia. He has behind him more then 10 documentaries. Among them is one 90 minute film about the Bulgarian prophet Vanga and 120 minute reel about the legend of the popular music in Bulgaria -- Emil Dimitrov.\n\n\u041b\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 - \u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043a\u043e\u0432\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442: \u0414\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\n\u0420\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043e\u0440: \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d \u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\n\u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0415\u0432\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0432", "title": "The Healer - Petar Dimkov", "publishedDate": "2008-04-07T21:26:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3OjPBJpIbCg", "description": "Kutter tries to break a little horse.

The symptoms of amoebic infection typically have to do with gastric intestinal symptoms so now you have vomiting and particularly with amoebic infections diarrhea that's not consistent is one of the hallmarks of amoebic infection, so you get diarrhea one day and the other two days you're fine, so it's that on and off type picture, that really classifies that type of infection pretty well sometimes. So the number one thing that you always look for is travel history and the second thing you look for is symptoms such as that type of diarrhea a very very low-grade infection, so it really doesn't give you a lot of symptoms in respect to fever or generalized malaise, so amoebic infections are usually- we think of them whenever the patients present with that kind of scenario.\n\nThe treatment for amoebic infections is, the number one is an antibiotic called metronidazole and that type of antibiotic really takes care of most of the amoebic type of infections and it's a simple treatment, it's an oral therapy, so the patient is given an antibiotic course anywhere between 7 to 10 days of therapy, and that's usually enough to get rid of the infection.\n\nTo learn more about services available at Kendall Regional Medical Center, please visit: \nhttp://kendallmed.com/our-services/index.dot", "title": "Dr. Robert Hernandez Discusses Amoebic Infections", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T19:55:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3OlepGOqoQg", "description": "Veja post completo no blog\nhttp://www.androidplace.blog.br\n\nCurta nossa p\u00e1gina no Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/androidplaceblog\n\nAgradecimento especial ao Yuri Camargo que fez a cobertura e grava\u00e7\u00e3o do evento.Blog Android Place, An\u00e1lises, V\u00eddeos, Not\u00edcias sobre dispositivos Android", "title": "Sony Xperia ZQ - Evento de lan\u00e7amento 25/04/2013 - M\u00e1gicas - parte 01", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T07:50:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Om2LlbDkMw", "description": "Mark Cundari lays a massive hit on Bulldogs player Joel Chouinard during action Friday Night, then drops the gloves against Mike Blunden.

It was isolated by Raphael Mechoulam, Yechiel Gaoni, and Habib Edery from the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel in 1964. In pure form, it is a glassy solid when cold, and becomes viscous and sticky if warmed. An aromatic terpenoid, THC has a very low solubility in water, but good solubility in most organic solvents such as butane or hexane. As is the case with nicotine and caffeine, the role of THC in Cannabis, it seems, is to protect the plant from herbivores. THC also possesses high UV-B (280-315 nm) absorption properties, protecting the plant from harmful radiation.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol\n\nThis video highlights the effects of THC on human brain cancer cells (also called GBM) and normal brain cells.  \n\nThe video on the LEFT of the screen is of normal brain cells.

The inner thigh muscles stabilize outward rotation as well as pull the legs towards the center of your body. Strengthening this muscle will improve agility and range of motion of your legs. This agility and range of motion is mostly required for dancers, but tightening the muscles will give a sleek, toned look to your thighs. \nAs with any exercise, be sure not to strain yourself.

Contrails form above 33,000 feet when hot engine exhaust momentarily condenses ice crystals into pencil-thin vapor trails that quickly vanish behind a jet. However, chemtrails, looking initially look like contrails, are thicker, remain extended across the sky and are sprayed in varying patterns:  x\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, tic-tack-toe grids, cross-hatch and parallel lines. Instead of quickly dissipating, chemtrails expand. Usually within thirty minutes, they open into wispy formations, looking like cirrus-type clouds (thin veil clouds) that persist for hours but slowly waft from the skies on our families, friends and strangers below.\n\nLaboratory examination of those chemicals found that they were manufacturing wastes from military industry and biowarfare substances. In several laboratory analyses, the composition of chemtrails was revealed:\n\n1. Aluminum barium \n2. Aluminum Oxide \n3. Bacilli and Molds \n4. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa\n5. Pseudomonas Florescens\n6. Bacilli Amyloliquefaciens\n7. Streptomyces\n8. Enterobacteriaceae\n9. Serratia Marcscens\n10. Human white Blood Cells-A restrictor enzyme used in research labs to snip and combine DNA\n11. Enterobacter Cloacal\n12. Other Bacilli and other toxic molds capable of producing heart disease and meningitis as well as acute upper respiratory and gastrointestinal distress.\n13. Carcinogen Zinc Cadmium Sulfide. \n\nAfter chemtrails lingered, spread, covered entire skies and fell, reports of illnesses increased substantially, such as persistent hacking coughs, upper respiratory and intestinal distress, pneumonia, fatigue, lethargy, dizziness, disorientation, headaches, aching joints and muscles, nosebleeds, diarrhea, bloody stools, depression, anxiety, loss of bladder control, and nervous tics. Much of it is reported as flu and everyone but a few know that much of it is poisons dropped over our heads, inhaled, absorbed through our skins, and consumed in our food.\n\nUsing both electrostatic precipitation devices and hepa air filters to collect outdoor atmosphere samples, chemtrail researcher Cliff Carnicom and his associates have documented desiccated blood cells floating in the atmosphere in populated areas of both New Mexico and Colorado. With so many atmospheric samples containing biological components, Carnicom concludes that crimes of the highest order are being perpetrated against citizens without their knowledge or consent.\n\nWitnesses have documented and photographed military KC-135's, KC-105 and white unmarked jets spray chemtrails. Airport personnel and pilots confirmed specific commercial airliners leaving the long-lasting chemtrails. Although chemtrails are frequently reported, the US Government continues to deny the existence of chemtrails. \n\n_____\n\nAlso check out:\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2078372315727.2115434.1137591791&type=1&l=ef49c8fcf0", "title": "Chemtrails in Puerto Rico: December 14. 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-12-15T02:06:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P5dzZ72hLw", "description": "R\u00e9pet. de Daguerre lors de la r\u00e9sidence en avril 2012 \u00e0 l'atabal \u00e0 Biarritz.", "title": "DAGUERRE-\"les sillons de nos rides\" (travail en r\u00e9sidence)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-17T09:59:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P5f4eZ1dIE", "description": "Messed up a few words...but YOLO right?", "title": "You Don't Know You're Beautiful - One Direction (Saga City Cover)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-05T03:37:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P5q_CTW-sk", "description": "Victory enters the battle with the biggest engine and lofty storage claims, but how did it fare in our 2014 V-Twin Tourer test?

This is called cerebral spinal fluid. Injuries and infections of the brain or spinal cord change this fluid. Studying your spinal fluid helps your doctor diagnose the cause of your symptoms.\nHow is a spinal tap performed?\n\nSpinal fluid flows around your brain and down and up through the spinal canal of your back, all the way to base of your back. Your spinal cord -- a nerve bundle -- runs only part way down your back.\n\nYour doctor will give you a small shot of anesthetic in your lower back to numb the area. A needle will then be inserted between the bones of your lower back. This area is below the spinal cord or nerve bundle. About a teaspoon of spinal fluid can then be drained and sent to the lab for study.\nAre there alternatives to a lumbar puncture?\n\nUnfortunately there is really no other way to see or study spinal fluid besides a lumbar puncture. While CT scans and MRI show the brain quite well, they do not show cellular changes like infection. Infections in the brain can be deadly, and a lumbar puncture can insure that the infection is found.\nAre there any risks or complications of a lumbar puncture?\n\nThe lumbar puncture is done below the spinal cord so it can't be damaged. But there are nerves in the lower back. Sometimes these are poked by the needle causing a shooting pain or pressure but not permanent damage.\n\nYour doctor will take every precaution to avoid exposing you to germs. But anytime a needle is inserted through the skin, there is a slight risk of infection.\n\nThe most common complication of a lumbar puncture is a headache. While these occur in up to 30% of patients, most resolve within 24 hours without any special treatment. \nWhat precautions are taken to avoid complications?\n\nBy using a small needle, carefully placed in the lower back your doctor will try to avoid injury to or pain from nerves.\n\nYour doctor will clean and sterilize your back, cover it with sterile drapes and use sterilized gloves to avoid infection.\n\nSpinal headaches are caused by spinal fluid leaking after the needle is withdrawn. Special spinal needles are used to help avoid leaks.\nDo you consent to having a lumbar puncture?\n\nWhile there are risks of a lumbar puncture, your doctor believes the importance of obtaining your spinal fluid for testing outweighs the risks. \n\nNow that you understand why the lumbar puncture is to be done, how it will be done, and the possible risks, your doctor needs your consent to proceed.", "title": "Lumbar Puncture Informed Consent - Incendant", "publishedDate": "2012-06-13T18:30:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P6QLbmFz-U", "description": "This generator  already work 25 years..since 1984", "title": "Water Wheel 3kw Generatator 280V  work 365 days 24hours", "publishedDate": "2009-08-04T08:07:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P6_5PIX5FE", "description": "Premios de la Radio 2014", "title": "Noel Torres - Jonathan Sanchez - Premios de la Radio 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T06:43:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P6eGbD1CnY", "description": "", "title": "TVC Mee eten 15 online", "publishedDate": "2013-12-05T15:11:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3P6st3xNMvM", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehoweducation\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehoweducation\n\nYou can determine if a slope is positive, negative, undefined, zero or imaginary at a point on a graph in a very specific way.

It later moved into a wooded area before dissipating after damaging numerous trees.\n\nGrass and dirt in fields near Jarrell were ripped out of the ground to a depth of 18 in or (50 cm). When the tornado crossed county roads outside Jarrell, it ripped 500 feet (150m) of asphalt off the roads.\n\nAbout 40 structures were completely destroyed by the tornado and dozens of vehicles were lifted in the air and tossed, some thrown more than half a mile. Many researchers, after reviewing aerial damage photographs of Double Creek Estates, considered the Jarrell storm to be the most violent tornado, in terms of damage intensity, that they had ever seen. Most of the homes in the tornadoes path were well-constructed and bolted to their foundations, but even so the tornado left only the slab foundations. Several entire families were killed in the tornado, including all five members of the Igo family and all four members of the Moehring family.\n\nThere were 27 human fatalities in the Double Creek subdivision. In addition, about 300 cattle were killed by the storm.\n\nAbout 10 minutes prior to the main event, eye-witnesses spotted additional tornadoes north and west of Jarrell.\n\nThe damage path associated with the Jarrell tornado actually begins in Bell County at a point\nabout 0.8 miles northwest of the Prairie Dell exit from Interstate 35, near mile marker 280. The tornado tracked south-southwestward across open country. Damage was primarily to trees, with\nonly a couple of structures damaged.\nThe tornado remained primarily in open country as it crossed the Bell/Williamson County line\nbefore taking a more southwestward turn that took it to the northwestern edge of Jarrell. The\ntornado crossed the county line very close to where Williamson Road ends and County Road\n(CR) 304 (Bell County) begins. The tornado crossed CR 308, CR 305, and then CR 307. Where\nthe tornado crossed each of these county roads, approximately 525 feet of asphalt was ripped off\neach of the roadways. This particular destruction was believed to be very close to the centerline\nof the tornado circulation. Observations recounted by eyewitnesses and revealed in interviews made by other members of the\nService Assessment Team indicated that the damage path may not have been made strictly by one\ntornado. A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing several small, rope-like funnels before the\ncharacter of the tornado changed drastically into the killer tornado.\nAs the tornado crossed the intersection of CR 305 and 307, a business on the corner was\ndestroyed. The tornado moved into the Double Creek Estates subdivision at this point with total\ndestruction. F5 destruction begins shortly after the tornado moved into Williamson County and\ncontinued until very close to the end of the damage path.\nMoving through the Double Creek Estates subdivision and the surrounding area, the tornado\nwidened to the maximum width of three-quarters of a mile. From the air, the ground appearance\nchanged abruptly in the vicinity of CR 308 and continued until very near the end of the path. No\ndefinitive circulation patterns or suction spots were evident, but there was the noted obvious\nchange in the appearance of the ground.  In the Double Creek area, approximately 40 structures were totally destroyed. One of the most\nstriking signs in approaching this area was the distinct lack of debris of any size. Closer\ninspection showed lots of little debris, but no sign of large items. At least half a dozen cars were\nidentified from the air lying in the open areas, most of them flattened and encrusted with mud and\ngrass. Later, a ground survey revealed that most of the debris that was left in the area was\nextremely small, indicating the power of the tornadic winds. All 27 deaths associated with the\nJarrell tornado occurred in the Double Creek area.\nAfter passing through the Double Creek area, the tornado moved across CR 309 and into a\nheavily wooded area of cedar trees. The total destruction of the tornado ends abruptly shortly\nafter entering the wooded area. However, a small swath of tree damage on the north side of the\nmain damage path suggested the possibility of a multiple vortex pattern.

This Alzheimer's Society film looks at what defines a Dementia Friendly Community and how to take part.\n\nThe Dementia Friendly Communities programme focuses on improving inclusion and quality of life for people living with dementia. Alzheimer's Society's five year strategy includes a key ambition to work with people affected by dementia and key partners to define and develop dementia-friendly communities. We want to create dementia-friendly communities across the country.\nIn these communities: people will be aware of and understand more about dementia; people with dementia and their carers will be encouraged to seek help and support; and people with dementia will feel included in their community, be more independent and have more choice and control over their lives. The Prime Minister's challenge on dementia also includes an ambition to create communities that are working to help people live well with dementia.\n\nWhat are Dementia Friendly Communities?\nA dementia-friendly community is one in which people with dementia are empowered to have aspirations and feel confident, knowing they can contribute and participate in activities that are meaningful to them. \nMany villages, towns and cities are already taking steps towards becoming dementia-friendly, or have an ambition to do so. However it is acknowledged that realising dementia-friendly communities will take a number of years. The dementia-friendly communities programme was launched at our Dementia 2012 conference. Through the programme, we aim to give public recognition and support to villages, towns, cities and national organisations who are taking steps towards being more inclusive of people with dementia.\nThe Society is working on building evidence to inform the future of the dementia-friendly community programme. Our report Building dementia-friendly communities: A priority for everyone provides evidence for dementia-friendly communities from the perspective of people affected by dementia. The Dementia-friendly communities infographic shows some of the results of the survey. \nWhether from places already taking action, or from communities seeking more information, we want to hear from villages, towns, cities and national organisations across the country.\n\nInterested in getting the latest updates from the Society?\nFollow us on Twitter -- http://www.twitter.com/alzheimerssoc\nLike us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/alzheimerssocietyuk\n___________\n\nWho are we?\n\nAlzheimer's Society is the leading support and research charity for people with dementia, their families and carers.\n\nWhat is dementia?\n\nThe term 'dementia' is used to describe the symptoms that occur when the brain is affected by specific diseases and conditions. Symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, confusion and problems with speech and understanding.\n\nSupport the fight against dementia and visit us at\nhttp://www.alzheimers.org.uk \n\nIf you have concerns about Alzheimer's disease or about any other form of dementia, please contact the Alzheimer's Society National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 1122.\n\nAlzheimer's Society\nLeading the fight against dementia\n________________________________", "title": "Dementia Friendly Communities - Alzheimer's Society", "publishedDate": "2014-05-21T12:13:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PEXusf4zIU", "description": "This popped up on Viacom's website around November 2013.

W. Myers sings \"You're Just The Girl I'm Looking For\" (song by E. Ray Goetz) on Columbia Phonograph Co. 32976 (1906).  The song was in J.C. Williamson's pantomime titled Mother Goose.\n\nJohn W. Myers, usually identified on records as J. W. Myers, was arguably the leading baritone balladeer in the first decade of commercial recordings, working regularly from the early 1890s to 1904 or so, after which a drop in his output is dramatic. \n\nBorn in Wales, Myers immigrated to America at age 12 and worked at various jobs, eventually becoming a theatrical manager in New York.  \n\nA catalog issued in 1898 by Columbia's New England headquarters--the Eastern Talking Machine Company at 17 Tremont Street, Boston--lists over fifty Myers titles and states, \"J. W. Myers, the famous baritone, whose records have achieved a wonderful popularity, has recently made a contract to sing exclusively for the Columbia Phonograph Company.\"  \n\nAlthough Columbia's 1898 catalog identifies Myers as exclusive to that company, Myers cut dozens of titles for Berliner, having sessions as late as November 1897, March 1898, and December 1898.  Columbia at that time made only cylinders.  His contract may have allowed him to make discs for Berliner. \n\nThe May 10, 1901, catalog of Zon-o-phone discs issued by the National Gramophone Corporation lists seven titles sung by Myers.\n\nHe cut over 100 titles in the early days of the Victor Talking Machine Company, beginning on February 20, 1901, with performances issued on seven-inch discs.  Sessions in October 1902 would be his last for Victor for a few years.  \n\nFor Edison he cut a couple dozen titles, most of them in 1901, beginning with \"Light of the Sea\" (7820).  He was a versatile artist, covering sentimental standards (\"We'll Be Sweethearts to the End,\" 9498), bass-baritone classics (\"Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep,\" 7840), and comic numbers.  \n\nAfter \"The Bridge\" (8010) was released in 1902, he stopped making Edison records for a few years, finally returning with \"Night Time\" (9470), issued in February 1907.  \n\nAnnouncing its release, the December 1906 issue of Edison Phonograph Monthly states, \"Mr. Myers was always a favorite among admirers of the Edison Phonograph and Edison Records, and his re-enlistment in the Edison corps of artists will be pleasing news to them.\"\n\nBy this time Myers recorded mainly sentimental numbers and songs of a previous generation.  The February 1907 issue of Edison Phonograph Monthly, announcing the April release of Standard 9524, states, \"'The Bowery Grenadiers,' by J.W. Myers, is a revival of an old song that will awaken more than ordinary interest.  It will recall by-gone days, when the late John W. Kelly entertained thousands with it.  Thirty or more years ago it was one of the most popular songs of the day.\"\n\nHis final Edison recording was \"Land League Band\" (9576), issued in June 1907.  The April 1907 issue of Edison Phonograph Monthly calls this \"a lively old march song popular a generation ago.\"  Myers was issued only on two-minute wax cylinders, his career with Edison being over by the time four-minute wax Amberols were introduced in 1908.\n\nHe was popular abroad.  The February 15, 1906, issue of the Talking Machine News, published in London, noted, \"The newsboys of London and New York whistle the same tunes, whether they are 'Navajo,' 'My Irish Molly O,' 'Bedelia' or 'In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree,' because the talker has made them known on both sides of the ocean....If George Alexander or Henry Burr or J.W. Myers were to advertise a concert in the Albert Hall next month, nine-tenths of their audience would be talking machine users.\"\n\nIn late 1905 he cut titles for Leeds & Catlin, which issued Myer performances on over a dozen Imperial discs, beginning with \"Somebody's Sweetheart I Want to Be\" (44637) in January 1906 (Imperial discs sold for sixty cents).  Edison and Victor issued Myers recordings until 1907.  One of his last Columbia recordings was a new take, with orchestra accompaniment, of \"Where the Silv'ry Colorado Wends Its Way,\" issued in January 1909 on A610.  This title had earlier been issued on single-sided disc 1092 as well as cylinder 32032, both with Myers accompanied by piano.  \n\nHis singing style was losing its appeal, and recording activity again dropped off.  Major H. H. Annand reports in a list of U-S Everlasting cylinders that Myers was among those who in 1908 started the U-S Phonograph Company of Cleveland, Ohio.  If true, it is curious that Myers did not make U-S Everlasting cylinders.\n\nHe resurfaced as a Columbia, Rex, and Emerson artist.  One late Columbia title is \"Along the Yukon Trail\" (A1614), issued in 1914.  \n\nWalsh concluded that he died around 1919.", "title": "J. W. Myers \"You're Just The Girl I'm Looking For\" (E.

His principles and ideology have continued to be a the guiding strength for the Trust and our multifarious activities. \n\nGurudev  was an ardent devotee of Lord Rama as a young boy. Born into the royal priest family of the erstwhile Kingdom of Gwalior, as a young boy he joined the hermitage of Shri Balkrishnadasji of the Ramanand sect who kept him under his tutelage and initiated him into Virakt Diksha (a high level of ascetic renunciation). He was thus named Ranchhoddas after his renunciation. He  traversed the country, across villages, cities, mountains and temples by foot in search of truth and self-realisation. Gurudev spent many years meditating and spreading his teachings. His life became an example of righteousness and of selfless service to the needy. Lakhs of followers gathered to hear Gurudev's discourses and teachings wherever he went. Gurudev led many who were lost in the mayhem of vices back to the right path of simple and honest living.\n\nMadhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the work initiated by Gurudev was formalized into the Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust in 1968. The name of the Trust amalgamated the core principle of 'seva' (selfless service) and the ideal of righteousness as taught by Gurudev. SSSST has since then endeavoured to follow these principles through each of its welfare projects.\n\nThousands of followers visit the Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust annually from across the world to render volunteer service to the cause and ideology inspired by Shri Ranchhoddasji Maharaj. Though Gurudev left for His heavenly abode in 1970, His endearing soul and timeless teachings of 'mutual respect, equality, selfless service and life of dignity for all' continue to guide the work of the Trust and provide the value framework on which the Trust stands strong.", "title": "Gurudev - Shri Sadguru Seva Sangh Trust", "publishedDate": "2011-05-03T09:16:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PJgm8_ODuU", "description": "New Season Premiere October 12 Sundays 9/8c.

Most importantly, you can pass on the entire lump sum to your spouse or named beneficiary upon death without having to pay tax on it. \n\nAvoid a 55% tax upon death and UK income taxes of up to 45% on any retirement benefits you take from your private pension schemes to an HMRC acknowledged Qualifying Recognized Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS). You can also cut out currency fluctuations by transferring your UK pension to EUR or USD or you can keep it in GBP. Have freedom of choice of investing in most shares, funds, ETF's, gilt funds, bond funds or property funds on the exchanges of your choice. You can also collate your funds into one easily manageable place.\n\nUK State pension schemes cannot be transferred, but money purchase, private pension schemes and defined benefit or final salary schemes can be transferred. Please note that any final salary schemes would be giving up any guarantees and benefits accrued in the UK. On the other hand, the whole lot would go to whoever you please upon death and would avoid UK income taxes and other UK taxes going forward as well as allowing you to invest in both the currency of your choice as well as the investments of your choosing.\n\nQROPS are intended for people who are considering retiring offshore completely. If they returned to live in the UK, there would be income tax imposed on any benefits taken, but any taxes upon death would be reduced and could likely be minimal.\n\nPlease find out more today, by clicking below.\n\nhttp://www.qropsspecialists.com/qrops", "title": "QROPS No More UK Taxation on UK Pensions for British Expatriates", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T13:47:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PPQX1dgDtY", "description": "http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi Learn Hindi in 3 Steps. Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Learn to Speak Hindi As a New Challenge", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T13:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PPcHITiTEE", "description": "\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 American Monroe: The Making of a Body Politic.

It is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac and smooth muscle.

Otherwise known as the goosefish or anglerfish, this vastly huge, unsightly, \"benthic\" or bottom-dwelling fish roams coastal Atlantic waters from North Carolina to Newfoundland. The term \"all mouth\", commonly used to describe the monkfish, is an understatement. Its enormously, gaping mouth comprises most of its entire body, which can range up to three feet in length. Its muscular tail is home to the tail meat of the monkfish. Contrary to its ungainly appearance, its tail meat is reputed to be astronomically delicious. Although it was once illegal, in France, to display the beastly creature in local markets for fear of scaring passersby, today, the monkfish has grown in reputation for its most flavorful, succulent meat.

He is seen as the most important teacher (\u0101c\u0101rya) of their tradition who followed Nathamuni and Yamunacharya, and by Hindus in general as the leading expounder of Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita, one of the classical interpretations of the dominant Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy.\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad-------------------------------------\nVisishtadvaita philosophy\n------------------------------------\nRamanuja's philosophy is referred to as Vishishtadvaita because it combines Advaita (oneness of God) with Vishesha (attributes).\n\nRamanuja may have written 9 books. They are also referred to as the nine precious gems, the Navarathnas.\n\nHis most famous work is known as the Sri Bhasya or Brahma Sutra Bhasya. It is a commentary on the Brahma Sutras, known also as the Ved\u0101nta S\u016btras of Badarayana.\n\nGadhya Thrayam (three prose hymns). All three are important works in Srivaishnava philosophy: \n\nVaikunta Gadyam describing in great detail Vaikuntha, the realm of Vishnu and recommending meditating on it.\n\nSriranga Gadyam, a prayer of surrender to the feet of Ranganatha\n\nSaranagati Gadyam, an imagined dialogue between Ramanuja and Shri (Lakshmi) and Narayana where he petitions Lakshmi to recommend Narayana to give him grace. Narayana and Lakshmi accept his surrender.\n\nVedartha Sangraha (a resume of Vedanta). It sets out Ramanuja's philosophy, which is theistic (it affirms a morally perfect, omniscient and omnipotent God) and realistic (it affirms the existence and reality of a plurality of qualities, persons and objects).\n\nVedanta Saara (essence of Vedanta) an appendix to Sri Bhasya\n\nVedanta Deepa (the light of Vedanta), another appendix/commentary to Sri Bhasya.\n\nGita Bhashya ( his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita)\n\nNithya Grantham (About the day to day activities to be performed by all Sri Vaishnavas)\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad-------------------------------------\n\nRamanuja's achievements are visible to this day. Iyengar Brahmins in South India follow his philosophical tradition. The Tamil prabhandas are chanted at Vishnu temples on par with the Sanskrit vedas. Persons of all communities, and not just Brahmins, are given roles in rituals at Srirangam and other leading temples. The philosophic discourses have been passed on to subsequent generations by great successors like Pillai Lokacharya, Vedanta Desika and Manavala Mamuni who lived in the 13th and 14th centuries. Several hagiographic accounts suggest that Ramanuja was an incarnation of Sri Adi-Sesha. The Swaminarayan tradition of Gujarat also traces its acharya-paraMparA to Ramanuja through Ramananda (who according to legend was administered pancha-samskaras by ramanuja).\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad\u00ad------------------------------------\n\nIn almost all of Sri Vaishnava temples, Acharya Ramanuja is given the foremost prominence. His blessings are invoked at the beginning of devotional services. Several temples like Sri Venkateswara Temple at Tirumala, Sri Parthasarathy Temple at Chennai, Sri Thirunarayana Swami Temple at Melukote have exclusive shrines dedicated to him. The Sattrumurai, or Appellations made to the Lord, at the end of daily services in a Sri Vaishnava temple always conclude with the words: Sarva Desa Dasa Kaleshu Avyahata Parakrama | Ramanuja Arya Divyajna Vardhatam Abhivardhatam ||\n\nMeaning: Let the most Magnificent instruction of Sri Ramanuja increase and pervade through all countries at all times, without any hindrance.\n\nAnnamacharya had written songs such as Gatulanni Khilamaina Kaliyugamanduna and Unnatonnatudu Udayavaru in praise of Ramanujacharya.", "title": "Sri Ramanujacharya Kovil - Srirangam Temple - Sri Ramanujar's Thirumeni Preserved-Trichy-Tamil Nadu", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T14:49:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PemN1e_l3I", "description": "Estratto da \"Struggle Radio\" \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/it/album/struggle-radio/id889935880\n\nInoltre disponibile in 2LP Vinyl su http://www.unlimitedstruggle.com\n\n\nPromozione & Marketing: SMC Italia - filippog@smceurope.com\nUna produzione Unlimited Struggle Recordings\nwww.unlimitedstruggle.com", "title": "Stokka & Madbuddy, Roc Beats aka DJ Shocca - Fragile -  (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-17T22:13:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Pg8hCaNg4Y", "description": "27.05.2014r. na zbiorniku Dzier\u017cno Du\u017ce", "title": "Jak nurkuje markaczka (Melanitta nigra)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T20:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PgFYe4pekI", "description": "We buy Houses cash beaumont Ca real estate, homes properties, lotts, quick sell sale\n \nvisit our site at http://1855junkyhouse.com or call toll free at 1855.586.5946\n\n\n\nIs it time to let go of the house?

I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s fun at all, it\u2019s macabre.\nAnd apparently it\u2019s a popular app with the people at the Center for Disease Control or CDC \nBut with all the talk in the news about the latest Ebola outbreak in West Africa, I thought I\u2019d do a video on both the simulator & Ebola\u2026\nEbola is a virus that was discovered in Africa in the 70\u2019s It\u2019s named after the Ebola river in the Congo where it was found.\nIt's currently incurable, with death occurring in a matter of days.  You have a 50% to 90% chance of dying and if you survive it there are still some nasty symptoms that you\u2019ll be living with.\nIt\u2019s initial transmission is believed to come from animals like monkeys and pigs\n\nEbola Symptoms appear quickly and include fever, chills, sore throat, severe headache, weakness, joint pain, muscle pain, and chest pain, cough, shortness of breath and hiccups. agitation, confusion, fatigue,seizures, and coma.  The disease goes to work on you by dropping your bloodpressure, massive blood clotting causing multiple organ failure and tissue necrosis, which is a medical way of saying your body rots.\n\nIt can be spread through body fluids, animals, even the air and is considered a Category A Biological Weapon.\n\nSo the only way to prevent an outbreak is to quarantine anyone who has it.  There was an infected individual who nearly boarded a plane to the US however airline crews and airport personnel are trained to spot people who may be infected.\n\nThe current 2014 outbreak in West Africa is the worst ever recorded, but it\u2019s believed that the Plague of Athens in 430 BC could have been an outbreak of Ebola.\n\nNow it\u2019s unlikely in my opinion that Ebola will annihilate the human race, and playing the Plague Inc simulator actually teaches you that in an indirect way.  But it doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t tragically devastate parts of the world.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking to learn about the causes, types, spreading and prevention of disease then Plague Inc is for you.

Okay, it doesn't sound sexy at all but will totally lower your heating bills.\n\nHey there, I'm Jeff with Home Repair Tutor and this video shows you some great tips on weatherizing old windows. This is especially important if you've got noticeable drafts that make your home chilly in the winter.\n\nOne of our awesome community members over Home Repair Tutor gave me a fantastic idea to couple with plastic film: use bubble wrap. \n\nYou can buy bubble wrap for $5 and apply it to the window then add the plastic film. It's double insulation. And a 9 pack of plastic film costs about $14. \n\nPlus you don't need too many tools. Seriously, all I used were a pair of scissors, packing tape, and hair dryer.\n\nYou'll have to add two separate layers of double sided tape to your window (which comes with the film). One layer is for the bubble wrap and the other is for the film.\n\nI'll walk you through this step by step.\n\nCheck out the video for all the details on how to weatherize windows with plastic film insulation and bubble wrap.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3PkFKG4b7ic\n\nIf you thought this video was helpful PLEASE Like it so that others will see it, too. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/3PkFKG4b7ic\n\nFor tips on home repair & improvement make sure you check out more Home Repair Tutor videos on YouTube.\n\nIf you liked this video you might also enjoy another one I did door weatherstripping. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/FBMJvC9TZ3A\n\nThis is a cheap way to stop drafts coming from doors.\n\nHope you like it.\n\nThanks for checking out my videos. \n\nCheers,\n\nJeff", "title": "How to Weatherize Windows with Plastic Film Insulation -- by Home Repair Tutor", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T09:30:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PkkHsuMrho", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nFollow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 Official Trailer #1 (2014) - THG Movie HD\n\nKatniss Everdeen reluctantly becomes the symbol of a mass rebellion against the autocratic Capitol.\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

The band was formed in late 1981. In less than a year Willful Neglect had 12 original songs and in the summer of '82 decided to record at Blackberry Way Studios with Steve Fjelstad, who also recorded many Twin Tone Records acts. The result was the Willful Neglect 12\" EP, released November of 1982 on the band's Neglected Records. Maximum Rock'n'Roll fanzine called \"Abort the Mission\" from the EP \"one of the best songs of 1982\" on the cover of MRR issue #4.\n\n They were featured on local CBS affiliate WCCO-TV on a \"Local Punk\" news report, where a show at Castle Greens in North St. Paul was filmed for broadcast. The band also played clubs in St Paul & Minneapolis such as The 7th Street Entry, McCafferty's, and Goofy's Upper Deck with bands such as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Minor Threat, The Circle Jerks, Loud Fast Rules (who became Soul Asylum), The Effigies, Rifle Sport, Man-Sized Action, Final Conflict, Ground Zero, The Reds, and Civil Defense. They then started to play other Midwestern cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee while becoming friends with The Effigies, Die Kreuzen, Naked Raygun, Articles of Faith, Sacred Order, Rights of the Accused, The Clitboys, and Negative Element. \n\nWillful Neglect recorded their second 12\" EP Justice For No One in early 1983, once again employing Steve Fjelstad at Blackberry Way. The Replacements recorded their EP Stink the very same month in the same studio. Justice For No One was released in the summer of 1983 on Neglected Records. The band then toured the West Coast in August, playing Reno, San Jose, San Francisco, San Fernando Valley, East LA, and Albuquerque. They shared the stage with bands like DRI, SS Decontrol, Government Issue, Agression, Ill Repute, The Fuckups, Los Olvidados, Plain Wrap, and Personality Crisis, and stayed at the BYO house in Hollywood while in southern California. \n\nA third record was recorded but not released \"Big Enough to Get It\" Six of the tracks from Big Enough... have ended up on 1982-1984, a CD released Fall of 2003 on Neglected Records.

The story traverses the full spectrum of emotions. It unfolds with tasteful sentimentality, driven by a powerful score from a proven film composer.\nAs the film opens, twelve-year-old piano prodigy, Chinelo (aka Nelo) Olisa, takes delight in the amazement on the faces of shoppers who hear her playing, and believed Mozart has returned from the grave. That same night, Nelo again reincarnates Mozart, as the featured pianist in concert with the Fort Bend Symphony Orchestra. She and the Orchestra play to a packed house. It is her last performance.\nOn their home from the concert, an accident happens and Nelo is trapped in the family's burning car. It is quickly obvious that she will not escape...and is destined to burn to death. A man on the scene, unable to allow the twelve year old to die such a horrible death, provides her the only escape possible...death from a single gunshot.\nWhat happens next will blow your mind away!", "title": "Pound of Flesh Teaser Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T21:15:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3PxzL-bohMQ", "description": "This Tesco finest* kedgeree recipe is a simple combination of lightly spiced smoky fish, leeks and rice.

Crimea belonged to Moscow for 200 years. Russia annexed it 20 years before Jefferson acquired Louisiana. Lost it in the humiliation of the 1990s.

Makes invasion sound like a breach of etiquette \u2014 like using the wrong fork at a Beacon Hill dinner party.\n\nHow to figure out Obama's foreign policy?

Followed by the assertion that \"alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone Cold War\" \u2014 like NATO? \u2014 \"make no sense in an interconnected world.\"\n\nPutin's more cynical advisers might have thought such adolescent universalism to be a ruse.

Description of historical background of the ancient communities\n\n==Views==\n\nMufti Muhammad Iqbal Kharal, the Khatib of Hazrat Mian Mir Mosque, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had a distinguished status among the contemporary intellectuals and scholars. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had tried to spread the gnosis of the Holy Qur`an in the world by undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an. He said Shaykh-ul-Islam was such personality who was uniting Umma on a single platform as well as spreading the Quranic teachings in the modern way.\n\nDr Jamil-ur-Rahman Chishti of the Chishtia Abad, Kamoki, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadris translation of the Holy Qur`an enlightens the readers with the real spirit of the Holy Book. The unique and lucid style of translation distinguishes Irfan-ul-Qur`an from the existing body of translations. \n\nCentral Amir of Jamat Ahl Hadith, Pakistan, Allama Zubair Ahmad Zaheer said that Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri did full justice to the demands of translation and rendered the translation beautifully by rising above sectarian affiliations. He congratulated Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri for doing translation of the Holy Qur`an for the entire Muslim Umma and all sects. \n\nRenowned scholar Dr Tahir Hameed Tanoli said that if the translations of the Holy Qur`an done in the subcontinent were the tree, Irfan-ul-Qur`an, the translation of the Holy Quran by Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was its fruit. This translation had the unique quality of an exegesis in terms of its meaningfulness. Shaykh-ul-Islams translation of the Holy Book was a great scholarly feat of the contemporary age from which the Umma would continue to derive benefit for centuries. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has made the reverence for the Holy Prophet (saw) the pivot and no where does the translation go away from this.\n\nKhawaja Muin-ud-Din Koraija of Kot Mitthan said that Irfan-ul-Qur`an would continue to be read till the Day of Judgment. Irfan-ul-Qur`an not only removes the doubts and reservations of the modern mind but also offers remedy for the scourge of sectarianism. Our society is engulfed in terrorism. The Islamic message of peace was the dire need of the hour and Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is known as an ambassador of peace in the entire world. He also declared to hold the inauguration ceremony of Irfan-ul-Qur`an in the annual spiritual celebrations of Kot Mitthan.\n\nPrincipal of Pakistan Law College, Dr Hamayun Ihsan, said in his talk that undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an was the most difficult job of the world. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri deserved felicitation that he did a great favour to the Umma by doing simple, lucid and modern translation of the Holy Qur`an, which is also compatible with the contemporary demands. Dr Ihsan said that if the translations of the quality books were undertaken, it would go a long way in guiding people through a maze of problems. The Umma could regain its lost glory by reading Irfan-ul-Qur`an, for such is its scholarly depth.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith Muhammad Mi`raj-ul-Islam said that there were a few translation of the Holy Qur`an, which did not contain the element of reverence and respect. Irfan-ul-Qur`an is such a valuable treasure as removes all doubts and enhances respect for the holy personages.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith of Jamea Nizamia, Lahore Maulana Abdut Tawab Siddique said in his speech that there was dire need of reviving our relationship with the holy Quran. This endeavour of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri really deserves appreciation. His Quranic translation \"Irfan-ul-Quran\" is a became of light for all Muslims.\n\nArab scholars, ash-Shaykh Dr al-Farfur, ash-Shaykh Dr Sayyid Mahmud Abu al-Huda al-Husaini and ash-Shaykh As`ad Muhammad Sa`id as-Sagharji also addressed at the ceremony at the occasion. They said that they could not fully benefit from Irfan-ul-Qur`an because of their ignorance of the Urdu language, which they branded as great deprivation.", "title": "Irfan ul Quran, Sura Al-Kafirun (109) by Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T11:34:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Q9qf7xzw4Y", "description": "Ji-sung Park is presented New club ambassador Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson", "title": "Ji-sung Park is presented New club ambassador Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T15:29:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QAVQ_hQr4I", "description": "John Cage gets into the airport\nBut the airport is not into him\nAnd so they agree to part amicably\nAnd Cage takes the train into town\n\nAnts have a system of governance \nFrom which one could learn, I dare say \nBut when I get an ant on the tip of my tongue\nI spit it away with a cry\n\nI have a dear friend, Captain Harlock\nAnd he sits at a table of wood\nLapping my words up, because he has heard that\nSome words are better than food\n\nI love throwing rocks at the tigers\nAs they cower in their cage at the zoo\nBut now that the weather is colder\nI'd rather be throwing those tigers at you\n\nAn old electrician from Bremen\nTook a frazzled electrical cord\nConnected one end to the Devil\nThe other he lashed to the Lord\n\nEveryone's murdered by Charlie\nOr would be if they lived long enough\nHe moves in and grows in the holes of your nose\nAnd sooner or later you snuff\n\nThis is the problem with dreamers\nThey're all sitting safe as a house\nFor all the world, sirs, as the earthquake occurs\nAs if butter would melt in our mouth\n\nThe fall of the system of Usher\nWas achieved by a triumph of will \nThe clown as a proxy for Mother\nAnd Daddy takes care of the bill \n\nThe loneliness of Kaspar Hauser\nStrange thoughts occur in the brain\nIf you want to stay strong, make up little songs\nTo stop you from going insane\n\nSo John Cage gets into the airport\nBut the airport is not into him\nThey agree that it's key to live separately\nAnd Cage takes the train into town \n\nAnd everyone's murdered by Charlie\nOr would be if they lived long enough\nHe moves in and grows in the holes of your nose\nAnd sooner or later you snuff", "title": "Momus: System of Usher", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T07:42:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QB8Ic8SWlo", "description": "Unconscious Power - Iron Butterfly - Heavy - Psychedelic - 1968", "title": "Unconscious Power Iron Butterfly", "publishedDate": "2010-06-28T02:00:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QBLMV8cejk", "description": "Get the TAB and Backing Track of this song here: https://sellfy.com/p/U59S/\nGet the high quality mp3 of this song here: https://sellfy.com/p/9LnN/\nDan Mumm performing his own arrangement of Vivaldi's Concerto in Am.\nLearn to play Dan's guitar techniques at https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=934329&c=ib&aff=176192&cl=167171\" target=\"ejejcsingle\nDan's album is now available on iTunes! \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-glimpse-beyond/id586645787\nFor more on Dan go to his website at http://www.DanMumm.com\nBe sure to subscribe and don't forget to like Dan on Facebook! \nhttp://www.Facebook.com/DanMummOfficial", "title": "Concerto in Am - Vivaldi - Dan Mumm - Neo Classical Metal Guitar", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T04:35:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QBNP8e0Xjw", "description": "http://www11.nrk.no/urort/user/default.aspx?id=11555", "title": "Philter Winter Overdrive feat Carina Mykj\u00e5land", "publishedDate": "2009-04-12T23:04:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QBX6q1HT1E", "description": "I hate this so much. ;-;\nIt was sitting in my files and I just really wanted to get it out.

This term is different compared to absorption in which the solute diffuses into the solid and not on the surface.\nLangmuir isotherm is a model that is used to determine the amount of adsorbate that is adsorbed on an adsorbent as a relation to the partial pressure or the concentration at a specific temperature (isotherm). There are 5 main types of isotherm in this case the video will be focusing on Type I and Type II.\nType I isotherm is a monolayer adsorption of chemically active gases on microporous metal surfaces, but also with non-polar gases (e.g. methane and nitrogen) on zeolites. It implies to be typical of chemisorption. Whilst, the adsorption of water vapour on non-porous Al2O3 will leads to the Langmuir Type II isotherm with condensation. Basically, the potential fields from neighboring walls tends to overlap and interaction forces solid and gas molecule is correspondingly enhanced so the interaction might be strong enough to fill the pores completely at low relative pressure or concentration.\nType II shows large deviation from Langmuir model of adsorption, it is a multilayer physical adsorption of gas on nonporous solids. It often referred as sigmoid isotherms.  This type of isotherm can be a result of physical adsorption on microporous solid. Examples of Type-II adsorption are Nitrogen (N2 (g)) adsorbed at -1950 degree celcius on Iron (Fe) catalyst and Nitrogen (N2 (g)) adsorbed at -1950 degree celcius on silica gel.\n\nThe assumptions for applying Langmuir adsorption model: \n-The adsorbed gas is assumed to behave ideally, at low pressure this condition is considered true, hence Langmuir Equation is only valid under low pressure.\n-The capacity for adsorption is limited to only one layer of molecule on the surface i.e monolayer. Under low pressure monolayer is easily formed but under high pressure multilayer formation will occur as the gas molecules are able to attract more molecules towards each other. Thus, it is preferred to use the BET theory which explains multilayer adsorption process.\n- All of the adsorption sites are equivalent in terms of size and shape without regards to whether it is the first or last adsorbing particle. It is also assumed that the surface of solid is homogeneous where as a real solid surface is heterogeneous.\n-  Langmuir theory also suggests that the molecules do not interact with one another. However, this is incorrect as there are always weak forces of attraction that exist between the particles.\nApplications undergo Langmuir isotherm are, activated carbon and silica gel. Activated carbon is a form of carbon which has small, low-volume pores to increase the surface area available for adsorption. It acts as a fuel storage which used to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. Silica gel is a granular, vitreous, porous material form of silicon dioxide made synthetically from sodium silicate. It is used in chromatography as stationary phase.\n\nVideo prepared by: \n\nChong Tan Lim, Teh Wei Heng, Asma and Ashraf", "title": "Langmuir theory and Isotherms Type I and II", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T02:00:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QDriMS4xtU", "description": "\"Le Proph\u00e8te SAWS a dit : \"Ne vous indiquerais-je point deux paroles \u00e0 la fois faciles \u00e0 prononcer, lourdes dans la balance et tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9es du Tout Mis\u00e9ricordieux ? \"Gloire et puret\u00e9 \u00e0 Allah ainsi que louange, et gloire \u00e0 Allah le Tout Puissant.\"\"\" \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650", "title": "017 LA PRIERE DE CONSULTATION EL ISTIKHALA.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-07-28T14:43:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QEKGuC1zpo", "description": "With the newest of Jesse Cox' fantabulous singing talents featered in the newest RPGmakers video, i felt i could do nothing else than to create a metal version.

Those who perform Azan are known as 'Muezzin.' The honour of being the first Muezzin goes to Hazrat Bilal(R.A.), a black slave who converted to Islam. He had a very sweet, resonant and musical voice. He was appointed as Muezzin by the Prophet(peace be upon him) of Islam. The appointment of a black slave as the first person to call Muslims for prayers, shows that in Islam all human beings are treated as equals. Rich or poor, black or white, short or tall - all are equal in the eyes of Allah. It is the piety of each individual that makes the difference.\nAzan is recited in a loud voice by the Muezzin facing the direction of the Ka'ba in the following words, which are said in the order mentioned:\n\n\"Allahu Akbar\" - recited FOUR times. Meaning, \"Allah is the Greatest.\"(four times)\n\"Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah\" - recited TWO times. Meaning, \"I bear witness that there is none worthy of being worshipped except Allah.\"(twice)\n\"Ash-hadu anna Muhammad-ar-Rasoolullah\" - recited TWO times. Meaning, \"I bear witness that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.\"(recited twice)\n\"Hayya 'alas-Salah\" - recited TWO times.

Director Bruno Monsaingeon, himself a concert violinist, first heard Markov during a recital in New York entirely devoted to the Caprices and was left utterly dumbfounded. He says of that concert, \"the technical difficulties, as if naturally overcome, had been replaced by an incandescent musical imagination which made the Paganini Caprices a thrilling experience, far removed from the school-masterly and cautious approach of most violinists.\" Sir Yehudi Menuhin says \"Alexander Markov will certainly leave his mark on the music-lovers of the world and in the annals of the violin virtuosi of our day. He is without doubt, one of the most brilliant and musical of violinists.\" Mstislav Rostropovich says: \"Once I managed to hear his performance of the 24 Paganini Caprices on TV I am certain that he is one of the most interesting young violinists of his generation in the entire world.\"", "title": "Paganini - Caprice no.19, Alexander Markov, violin [HD]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T03:38:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QOfAW6CuBA", "description": "Let It Go - Frozen - Alex Boy\u00e9 (Africanized Tribal Cover) Ft.

I'm going to show you these examples on basses. It can be applied to guitars. It's the same principle. Typically you'd find, say, an active system on an acoustic guitar or acoustic-electric guitar. It just means that there's a pre-amp built into it. There's a whole circuit dedicated to a pre-amp. It requires a battery. If you put that into an electric guitar or bass you're going to be dealing with higher output pickups because now you have an actual onboard system powering those pickups. \n\nI have two examples. We have our 70s Precision bass, passive electronics. When you plug into an amplifier, you're now using... It's all the amp that's taking care of the output of the guitar. I'm going to switch to an active bass. You can see on the back of this Limbeck, this is the control area for your volume and tone and all the switching. This would be the battery compartment here.  That's where the circuit is for the active pre-amp. This is the same volume setting, the same EQ setting as we had for the P bass.\n\nYou're basically hearing hotter pickups. You're hearing higher highs, lower lows. Everything is amplified before it gets to the amp. That's the pre-amp. You'll notice when you're battery needs changing it'll start to fuzz out. It won't be quite as loud. It won't sound as tight. The whole purpose of that is to have a tighter, louder sound which is why you would go for an active system in a bass or guitar.", "title": "Active Pickups & Passive Pickups | Guitar Setup", "publishedDate": "2013-07-05T03:52:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3QnabaAnhiI", "description": "Mandag 24. februar er det premiere p\u00e5 TV 2s nye program, \"P\u00e5 tur med Dag Otto\".

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type\n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\nGlobally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES:\n\nThis type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nThe several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nDipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more details - \n\n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n     Nadipathy Centres \n\n1.
