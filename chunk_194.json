It depicts an evolution. Love as Happiness Winning.\n\n\"Theosophy (from Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 theosophia, from \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 theos, divine + \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 sophia, wisdom; literally \"divine wisdom\"), refers to systems of speculation or investigation seeking direct knowledge of the mysteries of being and nature, with particular concern on the nature of Divinity. Theosophy is also considered a part of the broader field of esotericism, referring to hidden knowledge or wisdom that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation. The theosophist seeks to understand the mysteries of the universe and the bonds that unite the universe, humanity and the divine world. The goal is to explore the origin of divinity and humanity (theogony and anthropogony) including the end of world, life and humanity (eschatology). Then, from investigation of these discover a coherent description of the purpose and origin of the universe (cosmogony). The theosophist inquires into the hieroglyphs of nature (insights, or poetic meaning, in flowers, rainbows etc.), using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, to apply active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.\"\nThe art is by Heidi J.

This year's show transformed Glasgow's SSE Hydro into an unforgettable time-travelling extravaganza, catapulting viewers through memories of the most outlandish moments in the MTV EMA's 20-year history.\nThe show kicked-off by transporting viewers back to 1994, where a young Nicki Minaj watched the first-ever MTV EMA from her bedroom before traveling into the future, making a grand entrance into the 2014 MTV EMA in a frilled ball gown and sequined bra . \"Her Royal Minajesty\" truly commandeered the evening, taking home the award for Best Hip Hop, and even giving the audience a show-stopping, jaw-dropping blend of her biggest hits including 'Super Bass', 'Anaconda' and a global debut performance of her new track 'Bed of Lies', which featured a surprise appearance by Skylar Grey. The host also made it rain, telling the Glasgow crowd, \"it's my round!\" before showering them with enough \"Minaj money\" for 1,000 free drinks.\nOne of the greatest rock bands of all time, U2 took to the MTV EMA stage for a fourth time with a poignant, understated rendition of 'Every Breaking Wave', accompanied by a strings section. Alicia Keys serenaded the crowd from the nearby viewing party at the O2 Academy Glasgow, with an inspired performance of her Best Song with a Message-nominated track 'We Are Here' being beamed into the SSE Hydro and to MTV EMA viewers the world over. Best Song and Best Female winner Ariana Grande flew over the audience in a perspex bubble chair, treating fans to a Barbarella-esque medley of her smash hits 'Problem' and 'Break Free', and  Ed Sheeran brought his chart-topping track 'Thinking Out Loud' to life, lighting up the stage with an elaborate music box.\nRock legend Ozzy Osbourne made his triumphant return to MTV to accept this year's Global Icon Award. In a surprise closing performance, Biffy Clyro's Simon Neil joined guitar legend Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators to pay tribute to Ozzy with an epic rendition of his classic hit 'Crazy Train'. \nElectro-pop songstress Kiesza teleported from Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square into the arena via a classic red phone booth to perform her track 'Hideaway' surrounded by popping dancers. British songstress Charli XCX set the arena ablaze with a glam-rock / punk rendition of her hits 'Boom Clap' and 'Break The Rules', and UK rock duo Royal Blood rocked the house, playing 'Figure It Out' in front of a two-storey wall of screaming fans in the middle of the auditorium. Best World Stage winner Enrique Iglesias called on the crowd to be part of his medley of 'Freak' and 'Bailando', with thousands of fans donning xylobands to light up the floor of the SSE Hydro.\nTrue to form, madness prevailed. Katy Perry revealed an unusual obsession with Minaj's \"pillows\", and the show further honoured the host's rear with a \"butt putt\" mini-golf green in the middle of the arena. Redfoo took to the stage dressed in a kilt to present the award for Best Pop to One Direction, having earlier revealed he was going commando on the MTV EMA red carpet, which was chosen by fans via social media with the hashtag #UnderFoosKiltEMA. In another nod to the heritage of the 2014 host city, David Hasselhoff dressed up in blue face paint to become \"BraveHoff\".\n\n\n\n\nThe best videos, the most exclusive moments of the international runway since 1982 until now, of the most representative fashion weeks of the world.

As a label synonymous with delivering humongous releases, \u2018Love Like This\u2019 from Tommy Trash & Henry Fong featuring Faith Evans, is already proving a stand-out release on the Revealed Roster for 2014.\nAustralian Tommy Trash is no stranger to the industry, with both Grammy and VMA nominations for his productions under his belt, Trash now joins the Revealed Rankings for the huge anthem \u2018Love Like This\u2019. Joining Tommy is Henry Fong, a Revealed favourite making his comeback after the ripple-effect of 2013\u2019s \u2018Get Down\u2019. 2014 has been a whirlwind year for Henry with appearances at many of the world's top festivals and a variety of chart-topping releases. Now, Trash and Fong join forces for the first time having just concluded Tommy's sold out TRASHED North America tour together.\nEnlisting famed r&b vocalist Faith Evans to add a modern twist on her original take of the 1998 classic, Tommy Trash & Henry Fong\u2019s version bounces back colossal beats with a heavyweight force across Evans\u2019s melodic vocal. Premiered by label boss Hardwell during his Ultra Japan set this year, \u2018Love Like This\u2019 is a modern take on a cross-genre classic, set to ignite dance floors across the winter season and live sets yet to come.\n\nFor more info:\nhttp://facebook.com/djtommytrash\nhttp://twitter.com/djtommytrash\nhttp://soundcloud.com/tommytrash\nhttp://instagram.com/djtommytrash\nhttp://youtube.com/djtommytrash\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/djhenryfong\nhttp://www.twitter.com/henryfong\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/henryfong\nhttp://www.instagram.com/djhenryfong\nhttp://www.youtube.com/henryfong\n\nhttp://www.revealedrecordings.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/revealedrecordings\nhttp://www.twitter.com/revealedrec", "title": "Tommy Trash & Henry Fong feat.

Making hula hoops at home is inexpensive, all you need:\nPurchase 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) 160psi irrigation tubing. This type of tubing is found at hardware or home improvement stores in the plumbing section. Buy a PVC pipe cutter and a 3/4 inches (19.05 mm) PVC tube connector. This cutter and connector are located near where you purchase the irrigation tubing. Cheap and the best way, you can also use a hacksaw! Soften one end of the tubing. Boil a large pot of water and insert one end of the tubing into the water for 30 seconds. Add about a 1/4 cup of rice, you can custom weight this, more or less rice.  Decorate the hula hoop.

Monday actually started out slow, as investors waited for results of the last Fed meeting to be released Wednesday.  \n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for this year by .1% and for next year by .2%; plus anemic economic reports from Europe contributed to major declines.  The Dow Industrials, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all lost more than 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Transportation index dropped 2.5%. \n\nOn Wednesday, however, all was forgiven as the Federal Reserve released their minutes for last September\u2019s meeting.  It showed members greatly concerned with communicating clearly that rate hikes will be dependent on economic data rather than a fixed timetable. With the bond purchasing program ending this month, this gave investors reassurance that interest rates would not immediately rise and a huge rally ensued, gaining back all of Tuesday\u2019s losses and then some.  For the S&P 500, a loss of 1.5% on Tuesday, followed the next day by a gain of 1.7% is an extreme in volatility that markets haven\u2019t seen since December 2011.  \n\nThursday got bad again when economists reported Germany is on the verge of a recession and energy stocks declined significantly as it became apparent that rising global supplies will exceed slowing demand.  However, jobless claims for the week ending October 4th were good, showing an increase of just 1,000 to 287,000.  Analysts had expected the number to be higher.

Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.\n\nTics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.\n\nImmediately preceding tic onset, most individuals are aware of an urge[9] that is similar to the need to yawn, sneeze, blink, or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension that they consciously choose to release, as if they \"had to do it\". Examples of this premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye.\n\nTics are described as semi-voluntary or involuntary, because they are not strictly involuntary\u2014they may be experienced as a voluntary response to the unwanted, premonitory urge. A unique aspect of tics, relative to other movement disorders, is that they are suppressible yet irresistible; they are experienced as an irresistible urge that must eventually be expressed. Some people with tics may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.\n\nTic disorders are commonly considered to be childhood syndromes; they may also be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder.", "title": "Jonathan's tics", "publishedDate": "2011-12-19T21:15:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFasw8dmX7Y", "description": "", "title": "taifun abator 2", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T19:31:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFavsrbx5KE", "description": "", "title": "Sirdar Saim", "publishedDate": "2013-10-15T09:23:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFaxuIWk3_s", "description": "Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes S-Rank Walkthrough Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRr5L69yg_kErKnE6884v8o722Abj096u\n\nExtra Op: D\u00e9j\u00e0-Vu\nThis mission is exclusive to PS3 and PS4!

I own a 2004 Silverado 1500 Z71 with a little over 107k miles.  I bought the truck with around 43k and noticed the \"clunking\" when turning at low speeds right around 60k.  After 2 years of \"putting up with it,\" I did some online research and someone mentioned this technique, but no video.  Here you go!\n\nUPDATE: 9/16/2014\n\nThanks for all the positive feedback, everyone. I apologize sincerely for not responding to everyone's comments individually. This video really has blown up over the last year or so and getting to everyone was proving to be more time consuming than I thought. I'll try to answer some of the most asked questions, though. Keep in mind I'm not a mechanic, and any issues you think might be more severe should definitely be checked out by a professional. Here's what I've come to learn about doing this procedure:\n\n1. Moving the steering shaft up and down several (at least 50 times) moves what's left of the factory grease around the gearing in the upper portion of the shaft, relubricating it.\n\n2. Adding a Zerc, or pressure fitting, to the lower end only ends up filling the entire shaft with grease, which over time, if not flushed and having more grease added, will only harden. I've read in some cases this can cause the shaft to completely seize into one solid piece, and if involved in a collision, could puncture through the steering wheel and strike the driver. \n\n3. Yes, I know exactly what it looks like.\n\n4. I have no idea if the procedure will work on other vehicles. It's possible if the vehicle is a GM brand, but it's best to do your own research. I just know the 2003-2006 GM trucks (Silverado, Sierra, Tahoe, Yukon, Yukon XL, Avalanche, Escalade) are all the same when it comes to this.\n\n5. Again, no, don't add any grease.\n\n6. This is only a temporary solution to the problem,. I've talked with a couple GMC/Chevy dealerships and there's never been a recall on this issue, but there have been Service Bulletins sent out. Their remedy is to replace the intermediate steering shaft with one of the same part number. I've had to repeat the procedure twice more since posting the video, as my Silverado has nearly 145,000 miles now.\n\n7. I can't stress this enough, I'm not a mechanic. If you think your problem is more severe, or think this isn't the fix to your problem, definitely see a qualified professional. \n\nThanks again for all your positive feedback! I don't make a lot of videos, as you can obviously tell, but please subscribe to my channel anyway, as the next project I'll be working on will definitely make it to Youtube.

The Beaver is the only rodent larger than the North American Porcupine found in North America. The porcupine is a caviomorph rodent whose ancestors rafted across the Atlantic from Africa to Brazil over 30 million years ago, and then invaded North America during the Great American Interchange after the Isthmus of Panama rose 3 million years ago. This animal is usually found in coniferous and mixed forested areas in Canada, Alaska and much of the northern and western United States, although rare, sustainable, breeding populations of porcupines are known to exist in West Virginia and in smaller numbers in nearby regions of western Virginia. They are also found in thicketed areas in shrublands, tundra and deserts as far south as northern Mexico. They make their dens in holes in trees or in rocky areas. Porcupines are usually dark brown or black in color, with white highlights. They have a chunky body, a small face, short legs and a short thick tail. This species is the largest of the New World porcupines and is one of the largest North American rodents, second only to the American beaver in size. The head-and-body length is 60 to 90 cm (2.0 to 3.0 ft), not counting a tail of 14.5 to 30 cm (5.7 to 12 in). The hindfoot length is 7.5 to 9.1 cm (3.0 to 3.6 in). Weight can range from 3.5 to 18 kg (7.7 to 40 lb), although they average under 9 kg (20 lb). Their upper parts are covered with thousands of sharp, barbed hollow spines or quills (actually modified hairs), which are used for defense. Porcupines do not throw their quills, but the quills detach easily and the barbs make them difficult to remove once lodged in an attacker. The quills are normally flattened against the body unless the animal is disturbed. The porcupine also swings its quilled tail towards a perceived threat. Porcupines are nearsighted and slow-moving. Porcupines are selective in their eating; out of 1000 trees in the Catskill forest, one or two are acceptable lindens, and one is a bigtooth aspen. Consequently, the porcupine has \"an extraordinary ability to learn complex mazes and to remember them as much as a hundred days afterward\". The porcupine is the only native North American mammal with antibiotics in its skin. Those antibiotics prevent infection when a porcupine falls out of a tree and is stuck with its own quills upon hitting the ground. Porcupines fall out of trees fairly often because they are highly tempted by the tender buds and twigs at the ends of the branches. The porcupine and the skunk are the only North American mammals that have black and white colours because they are the only mammals that benefit from letting other animals know where and who they are in the dark of the night.", "title": "On Location: The North American Porcupine", "publishedDate": "2012-07-30T06:04:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFl3EjoeaIU", "description": "Testing audio filter for CW (radiotelegraphy) reception - QTH: Civitavecchia DATE: March 9, 2013 @ 21:15 UTC on 7023 kHz", "title": "Direct Conversion 40m Receiver - Narrow CW AF Filter test", "publishedDate": "2013-03-09T21:25:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFl8KUq3By0", "description": "LeBron James makes a three point shot to keep the hopes alive in game 6", "title": "LeBron James makes a CLUTCH 3 point shot to keep the Heat's dreams alive in Game 6", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T03:51:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFlAiWxScns", "description": "No lo quiero oir, La Culpa De Que Lo Suba Es De Mango!!! xD queda dicho!!\nCasi me quedo sin respiraci\u00f3n pero la cant\u00e9 de una tirada xD", "title": "Hyperventilation Dance- Fandub Espa\u00f1ol", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T17:08:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFlP_0Mg43s", "description": "Vision from a Fisheries WA underwater camera stationed at Cathederal Rocks taken two weeks ago (04-11-11).", "title": "Carcharodon carcharias (RN42)3_NEW.AVI", "publishedDate": "2011-11-18T06:56:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFle4iD4C44", "description": "", "title": "Coltello Chris Reeve Large Sebenza 21 - Snakewood Inlay - Folding Knife", "publishedDate": "2012-12-15T14:20:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFlgvhd5Dx0", "description": "Rivet software is written by Ian Wraith", "title": "XPA2 polytone station decoding using Rivet java software (Russian intel number station)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T21:58:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFlkoaG1pTw", "description": "one hundred swans video for dear thankless.\nall music by: ben chisholm with help from amanda canutt\nvideo by: anthony giurlani", "title": "dear thankless, one hundred swans", "publishedDate": "2008-04-11T06:06:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFlm6AMU-g4", "description": "A short video on how LinkedIn can be used to amplify the website of a law firm.", "title": "The LinkedIn Loudhailer Effect for Law Firms", "publishedDate": "2013-09-09T18:34:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BFmB-Nr6fSI", "description": "This is how we load your motorbike onto our purpose built trailer.

Hirsuties Coronae Glandis is one of those conditions which may make even older men blush with same and discomfort. This is mainly why they are searching for information about this condition, as well as about any other genital disease on the internet. If you have reached this article because you wanted to know more about his condition, here are the main things you should know about the effects caused by Hirsuties Coronae Glandis. \nFirst of all, you have to know that they only appear on the head of your penis.

In fact, the place where the bumps appeared for the first time is also the place where they are going to stay. So, you will not have to worry further about this problem. \nNext on the list of worries men usually have when they first find out that they suffer from Hirsuties Coronae Glandis is that this condition is going to affect their sexual performances. This is also an unfounded worry, as the Hirsuties Coronae Glandis are only affecting the skin and not the other parts of your penis, thus there is no chance of influencing your sexual performances in any way. However, when your penis is constricted, you will feel discomfort and even pain, which may affect you psychologically. Stop thinking about that and try to ignore the feeling and you will see how in time the discomfort will lower down and you will no longer be affected by those little bumps. In addition to that, they are also going to diminish and even disappear in time, so that you will not have to cope with this condition all your life. \nIn addition to the physical problems, which as you could see are minim, the pearly penile papules are also capable of influencing the self-esteem and self-confidence of the man who has to deal with them. Thus, in addition to a treatment which may make the papules disappear, some patients may also need psychological treatment to overcome their low self-confidence and state of isolation which often results during the time the individual deals with this condition. \nResource box:\nIf you want to get rid of Hirsuties Coronae Glandis forever, without experiencing any side effects click here.

Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 300 lbs for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer to 45 to 60 lbs for smaller goat does.[7] Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pigmy, who stand 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder as adults.[8]\n\n\nEye with horizontal pupil\nMost goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" (meaning, 'genetically hornless') or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.[9] There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, in order to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring. These intersex animals are typically sterile.[10]Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.[11]\nGoats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.[12]\nGoats have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, an adaptation which increases peripheral depth perception.[13] Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera.\n\n\nGoat tails versus sheep tails.\nBoth male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.[14]\nSome breeds of sheep and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger -- though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) are short, and longer ones are often docked.", "title": "Goats sxm", "publishedDate": "2012-04-01T01:40:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BG2OK4TyNNU", "description": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I2OZC9K\n\nBargain! 6 Litres UHT Skimmed Milk Bottles Dairy Products Bar Restaurant Hotel B&B Cafeteria Cafe Pub Home Use Business Commercial Supplies\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I2OZC9K", "title": "UHT Skimmed Milk Bottles Dairy Products Cafe Bar Restaurant", "publishedDate": "2014-01-29T20:34:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "BG2Zw_zRtGc", "description": "\ubc15\uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\ub294 SPANX Open Bust Camisole!!", "title": "SPANX Open Bust Camisole \uc18c\uac1c", "publishedDate": "2012-05-03T01:45:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BG2dr1XLBFs", "description": "", "title": "Kim Chiu in Bikini (Two-Piece) Photo gone viral", "publishedDate": "2013-04-21T15:09:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "BG2xV2h_IW0", "description": "Tickets: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/723893\n\nClassic Ionesco comedy!

It is roughly the same size as the Mini-Cooper, and would sell for approximately $14,000.\n\nCompany founder Ian Clifford says Canadians haven't heard much about the car because Ottawa won't let him sell it here.\n\n\"We're getting road blocks thrown up in front of us every attempt down the road, and it's getting to the point now where we're almost giving up on Canada,\" said Clifford.\n\nThe car is considered a low-speed urban vehicle with a regulated maximum speed of 40 km/h. It's designed for areas where speed limits are 50 km/h or less, such as city core or neighbourhood-type driving, said Clifford.\n\nBritish Columbia is the only Canadian province to legislate this type of vehicle, he said.\n\nThe ZENN car has met all the regulatory requirements in the United States, the same regulations adopted by Transport Canada in 2000.\n\nTransport Canada response\n\nWhen asked why the cars won't be licensed in Canada, Harry Baergen, a senior regulatory enforcement engineer with Transport Canada provided the following responses to CBC News:\n\nCBC: \"[Has the ZENN car] met the regulatory requirement?\"\n\nBaergen: \"They haven't met our requirements yet, no.\"\n\nBaergen then says ZENN has met the requirements:\n\nBaergen: \"They've showed us that it meets requirements as an LSV (low-speed vehicle).\"\nCBC: \"They have shown that to you?\"\nBaergen: \"Yes.\"\n\nBaergen then says the licensing regulations are under review.\n\n\"Our definition is presently being clarified because there is a little bit of a broadness in it,\" he said.\n\nFounder frustrated\n\nClifford says he's frustrated by the federal government's position.\n\n\"Every time you have a conversation with Transport Canada it's a different story. The reality is, we meet the regulation,\" he said.\n\nHe says low-speed vehicles such as scooters or bicycles are already on the roads in Canada.\n\n\"Last week the prime minister said we can't meet our Kyoto protocols and every electric vehicle that's on the road, you offset six tonnes of CO2 emissions, per vehicle,\" said Clifford.\n\nWith the dollar on the rise and no Canadian market, Clifford says he's not sure how long his company can hold on.", "title": "Canada a real electric car conspiracy about the Zen", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T16:28:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "BG6BlM4-QlY", "description": "NEW!!!!

I heard the crack of a baseball hitting metal, sensed movement out of the corner of my eye, but all the P&E training in the world wasn't enough to help me dodge the tidal wave that crashed over my shoulders as the Deputy Chief of Police splashed into the tank. Yeah, that's right. My first Covert Operations mission was first wet T-Shirt contest, and as I stood there shivering, I knew it would probably be my last of both. People were rushing towards me, offering towels, asking if they could give me a lift home. Yeah, I'm stealthy, I thought, as I thanked them as unmemorably as possible and darted away.

As a girl, I wouldn't have minded a little corner-of-the-eye checking out, but as a spy, I was totally relieved that the whole drowned-chic look didn't undermine my covertness too much.

M/S Crowd at Thatcher's funeral procession\n\nSCRIPT\n\nUK: Iron Lady tours London one last time\n\nDraped in the Union Jack flag of the United Kingdom, the coffin of Margaret Thatcher made its way through London Wednesday morning to St. Paul's Cathedral for her funeral service. Over 4,000 police officers and 700 military personnel lined the streets along with hundreds of thousands of civilians to say farewell to the former British Prime Minister. Many were also hoping to catch a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II, who is attending the funeral of a former prime minister for the first time since the death of Winston Churchill in 1965.\n\nThatcher's coffin departed the Palace of Westminster at 10 a.m. local time (9 a.m. GMT) for a one-hour journey to St. Paul's along the Strand and the entire length of Fleet Street before rising up Ludgate Hill to St. Paul's. A 55 minute memorial service for Thatcher then began at 11 a.m., which is to be followed by a private cremation of her remains. The entire funeral procession was broadcast live on television stations including the BBC.\n\nNot everyone came out to say farewell to the woman many Brits refer to as the \"Iron Lady.\" Demonstrators held banners and booed when Thatcher's coffin passed, with others turning their backs in protest.\n\nAlthough not officially a state funeral, the lavish state-funded ceremony is expected to cost about \u00a310 million (\u20ac11.7 million), most of which is being funded by taxpayers. Security costs alone are thought to be around \u00a35 million (\u20ac5.85 million). Every corner of the route was checked by sniffer dogs, sewers and drains shut down, and additional police monitoring London's thousands of CCTV cameras to spot potential troublemakers.\n\nBesides Elizabeth II, other notable names among the 2,000-plus guests attending the funeral include former US Vice President Dick Cheney, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, current British Prime Minister David Cameron, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and FW de Klerk, the last white president of South Africa during the apartheid era.\n\nThatcher, who died April 8 after suffering a stroke, was Britain's first female prime minister and served from 1979 until 1990. One of the most divisive figures in British politics, she was perhaps best known internationally for leading Britain in the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982 and for advocating a conservative economic and social policy known as \"Thatcherism.\" Upon her death, celebrations by left-wing organisations were held in cities throughout the United Kingdom, and the 1939 song \"Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead\" rose to number two on the UK singles charts following support from anti-Thatcher protestors.", "title": "UK: Iron Lady tours London one last time", "publishedDate": "2014-04-08T07:37:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "BGMGYExoXJw", "description": "www.dredmusic.hu", "title": "Dred - Bolond ny\u00e1r", "publishedDate": "2006-12-27T07:41:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "BGMdtDWtVEs", "description": "Momento mais engra\u00e7ado do v\u00eddeo:\nN\u00c3O \u00c9 MENTIRA N\u00c3O, PERGUNTA PRA O GOMIDE!!(...) \n#Ele engasga e quase chora....

Un homenaje flamenco en toda regla.\n\nEn oto\u00f1o de 1963 Antonio Gades, una leyenda del baile flamenco, inauguraba la sala de la Plaza Real y en 1964 se iniciaba una programaci\u00f3n regular que, cincuenta a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, la ha consolidado como uno de los espacios con m\u00e1s solera y reconocimiento tanto a nivel nacional como internacional. Todos los exponentes del flamenco m\u00e1s enraizados a la cultura catalana, des de la m\u00edtica Carmen Amaya hasta los contempor\u00e1neos Mayte Mart\u00edn, Miguel Poveda, Duquende o Juan Manuel Ca\u00f1izares han dado sus primeros pasos entre las paredes de Tarantos. \n\nPero la historia de Tarantos no ha estado marcada solamente por su identidad flamenca, sino per haber generado un polo de atracci\u00f3n cultural hacia creadores bien diversos como Salvador Dal\u00ed, Miquel Barcel\u00f3, Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n, Sebasti\u00e0 Gasch y Joan Brossa, entre muchos otros. Tampoco ha sido nunca un tablao convencional, sino que en el decurso de su medio siglo de vida ha acogido a artistas de g\u00e9neros muy contrastados como el tanguero Virgilio Exp\u00f3sito, el sonero Compay Segundo, los cantautores Pedro Guerra y Jorge Drexler o el iconoclasta Pau Riba.\n\nFidl a este esp\u00edritu heterodoxo e innovador, el espect\u00e1culo que se presenta en motivo del 50 aniversario aporta como estreno absoluto la aproximaci\u00f3n del flamenco a la poes\u00eda en el rock y a la poes\u00eda en general. De esta manera, textos traducidos de poetas del rock como Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, Suzanne Vega, Hank Williams o Elliot Murphy y originales de Lorca y Machado se combinan en un montaje original y \u00fanico. Interpretados todos ellos por algunas de las grandes voces femeninas del cante bajo el coj\u00edn y la direcci\u00f3n musical de unos instrumentistas que sobresalen entre lo mejor de la plantilla del pa\u00eds.

The then-immigration quotas prevented Seymour's mother and other siblings from emigrating from Poland, so Seymour sang a song, which his brother Jack had composed, before President Calvin Coolidge which so moved the President that he granted the entry visas.\nRexite performed Yiddish translations of pop music standards as well as songs written in his native language.

Ihr Ziel ist es, alle Ihre Murmeln in das Haus des Feindes zu setzen, bevor Ihr Gegner Ihnen zuvorkommt. Wenn das Spiel beginnt, erhalten Sie ein Halmabrett in der Form eines Hexagramms. Das Brett ist in sechs H\u00e4user in verschiedenen Farben unterteilt. Die zehn blauen Murmeln auf Ihrer Seite befinden sich im blauen Bereich, wogegen die zehn gr\u00fcnen Spielfiguren des Computers sich im gr\u00fcnen Haus befinden. Sie und der Computer werden abwechselnd Spielz\u00fcge ausf\u00fchren. Wenn Sie an der Reihe sind, k\u00f6nnen Sie eine Ihrer Spielfiguren mit einem Klick auf ein angrenzendes leeres Feld ziehen oder springen Sie mit einer Folge von Spr\u00fcngen \u00fcber andere Spielfiguren. Die Anzahl der Spr\u00fcnge, die Sie ausf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen, h\u00e4ngt von den freien Feldern zwischen den zu \u00fcberspringenden Spielfiguren ab. Zum Beispiel, falls es kein freies Feld zwischen der zu ziehenden Figur und einer anderen Figur gibt, kann die springende Figur auf das erste freie Feld in der gleichen geraden Linie hinter der anderen Figur gezogen werden; und wenn zwischen der gezogenen Figur und der anderen Figur ein freies Feld ist, kann die gezogene Figur auf das zweite freie Feld hinter der anderen Figur auf der gleichen geraden Linie gesetzt werden. Beachten Sie, dass eine Spielfigur ihren Spielzug nicht auf einer der obersten vier Reihen der H\u00e4user beenden kann: es sei denn, es ist ihr eigenes oder ihr Zielhaus. Doch die Figur kann darauf springen und sofort wieder herausspringen. Die m\u00f6glichen Felder f\u00fcr einen Spielzug werden rot markiert, wenn eine Murmel ausgew\u00e4hlt wird. Wenn Sie Ihre Spielz\u00fcge ausgef\u00fchrt haben, klicken Sie erneut auf die gezogene Spielfigur und der Computer wird seine Spielz\u00fcge ausf\u00fchren. Fahren Sie fort, bis Sie gewonnen haben.

Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia).\nSome people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.\n\nOverweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.\n\nThe risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.\n\nMen whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

[Al-Mumin\u00fbn 23:56]\n\nEtc. And the Prophet (sallAll\u00e2hu 'alaihi wa salam) said:\n''He who has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of pride shall not enter Paradise. A person (amongst his hearers) said: Verily a person loves that his dress should be fine, and his shoes should be fine. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: Verily, Allah is Graceful and He loves Grace. Pride is disdaining the truth (out of self-conceit) and contempt for the people.  [Sahih Al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee narrated on the authority of Abdullah b.

Cast and audience had abandoned the stage and dashed under a nearby picnic shelter, where the performances continued.  This causes the lighting and acoustics in this video to be a bit odd, but I hope you still find it an enjoyable performance.  We certainly had fun.\n\nRegarding the \"Chastity Belt\" song, it seems to be a \"neo-Elizabethan\" bawdy song of fairly recent origin but I've not found much background history on it.  It has been popular with Folk Fairs, Renaissance Festivals, Rugby Clubs and a variety of other such venues since the early 1960s, and various folk artists have recorded versions of it since then.  There are recordings of it by various groups back at least to the early 60s, I've read that the song may actually have originated among the RAF soon after World War II, but I have not been able to verify that.  If anybody out there has any better information about this song and its origins, please feel free to comment here.\n\nRegardless of its origins, it is a fun song, and Cobbled Together do a nice version of it here.

Now, two and a half decades later, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the formation of the group in the famed Greenwich Village, this joyous yet deeply moving live concert is being first released on DVD by Shout! Factory.\nGet the DVD here: http://www.shoutfactory.com/?q=node/176016\n\n\"This Land Is Your Land\" is one of the United States' most famous folk songs. Its lyrics were written by Woody Guthrie in 1940 based on an existing melody, in critical response to Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\", which Guthrie considered unrealistic and complacent. Tired of hearing Kate Smith sing it on the radio, he wrote a response originally called \"God Blessed America\". Guthrie varied the lyrics over time, sometimes including more overtly political verses in line with his sympathetic views of communism, than appear in recordings or publications.\n\nGuthrie wrote the song in 1940 and recorded it in 1944. The song was not published until 1945, when it was included in a mimeographed booklet of ten songs with typed lyrics and hand drawings. The booklet was sold for twenty-five cents, and copyrighted in 1951.\n\nThe first known professionally printed publication was in 1956 by Ludlow Music (now a unit of The Richmond Organization), which administered the publishing rights to Guthrie's song. Ludlow later issued versions with piano and guitar accompaniments.\n\nIn 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR MORE VIDEOS: http://youtube.com/ShoutFactoryMusic\n\nCHECK US OUT ON FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Shout-...\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ShoutMusic_Live\n\nLyrics:\nThis land is your land, this land is my land,\nFrom California, to the New York Island,\nFrom the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nI roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps\nTo the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts\nAnd all around me a voice was singing\nThis land was made for you and me!\n\nThis land is your land, this land is my land,\nFrom California, to the New York Island,\nFrom the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nAs I went walking that ribbon of highway\nI saw above me that endless skyway\nI saw below me those golden valleys\nThis land was made for you and me!\n\nThis land is your land, this land is my land,\nFrom California, to the New York Island,\nFrom the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,\nThis land was made for you and me.\n\nAs the sun was shining, and I was strolling,\nAnd the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,\nAs the fog was lifting, a voice was saying\n\"This land was made for you and me!\"\n\nThis land is your land, this land is my land,\nFrom California, to the New York Island,\nFrom the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream Waters,\nThis land was made for you and me.", "title": "Peter, Paul and Mary - This Land Is Your Land (25th Anniversary Concert)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T22:24:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BGt-udPx2q8", "description": "black belt tim ugo\u0161cuje listera na treningu", "title": "black belt i dean lister", "publishedDate": "2010-09-23T06:04:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BGt5s4YqTsw", "description": "For the historical sword & buckler techniques we'll have to study Sigmund Ringeck and the I.33 treatise (Tower manuscript), but for sword & shield/buckler versus longsword there is not much material available.\n\nThis is just me and my friend Jeff experimenting with various tactics in this uneven one-handed vs. two-handed weapon matchup.

In Season Three of the hit competition series hosted by Mario Lopez, THE X FACTOR judges will travel the nation searching for talent 12 years old or over -- both solo artists and vocal groups -- who are willing to brave the panel for a chance to make their dreams of becoming a superstar come true. Auditions for THE X FACTOR were held this spring in Los Angeles, CA; Charleston, SC; New Orleans, LA; Long Island, NY; and Denver, CO. \n\nContestants will audition in front of THE X FACTOR judges, including Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, Kelly Rowland, Paulina Rubio, and an audience of thousands. This will be the ultimate test to prove they have the vocal ability, charisma and stage presence it takes to become a global superstar or breakout music act and win a recording contract with Syco/Sony Music. \n\nThose contestants who survive the first auditions will be divided into four categories: Boys, Girls, Over 25s and Groups. Each category will be mentored by one of the show's judges. Not only is it a competition between the hopefuls to stake their claim for the coveted win, but it's also a showdown among the judges as to whose acts will dominate the competition and make it to the finals. The judges may have their say in how the competition progresses, but it will be up to America to decide who ultimately has THE X FACTOR.\n\nThe Exit Interview: Alex & Sierra - THE X FACTOR USA 2013\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheXFactorUSA", "title": "The Exit Interview: Alex & Sierra - THE X FACTOR USA 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T19:20:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHDo5hNKlHM", "description": "Der Tobit Playmate ID-1 ist ein ungew\u00f6hnlicher Musik-Player: Er bef\u00fcllt sich selbst mit kostenlosen Songs aus dem Netz.

Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of \"fate\" games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends (Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven) to help them find their true love again.

Neither a late snowfall nor a light frost deter them, nor do deer, rabbit, squirrel or groundhog relish the poisonous leaves and flowers of the Narcissus genus. About the only negative one can offer is that, when used as a cut flower, one must avoid placing them in the same vase as other flowers, for they carry in them a compound that causes wilt in their companions. But a bouquet of Daffodils alone is as perfect a picture of spring bounty as it gets anyway. Any more would be in essence 'gilding the lily.'\n\nThe genus name comes from the Greek myth about the youth that became so enamored of his reflection that he lapsed into a waking coma, fell into the spring and drowned. Sounds like what happens to some people and their computers. Nevertheless, the Narcissus plant sprung up where the young lad had died. A variant on the name derivation has its origin in the narcotic properties of the plant (narkao, to grow numb). This plant is poisonous, so there may be some truth to that phylogeny. The exact number of species within the genus is up for debate, with some averring that around 25 species of wild types are known, while others suggest that between 50 and 100 species, variants and wild hybrids is more like it. They are all members of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae), and native to Europe, North Africa and Asia.\n\nThe words Daffodils and Narcissus are used by many interchangeably. The word daffodil comes from the earlier \"Affodell,\" a variant of the word 'Asphodel.' The 'd' is thought by some to have been derived from the Dutch article 'de;' \"de affodil.\" The term Jonquil is also used by a few in reference to Narcissus, but it more properly refers to one horticultural grouping of the genus.\n\nThere are 13 official groupings according to the American Daffodil Society: 1. Trumpets; 2. Large-cupped; 3. Small-cupped; 4.Double; 5. Triandrus; 6.Cyclamineus; 7. Jonquilla; 8. Tazetta; 9. Poeticus; 10. Bulbocodium; 11. Split-corona; 12. Miscellaneous and 13. Species and wild variants. My family knows that I would fit in the last, while aspiring to the ninth grouping.\n\nNarcissus are sold as bulbs, harvested in mid- to late summer for shipment in early to mid-fall. Plant the bulbs in good well-drained garden soil. It is best to plant them in full sun but partial shade is okay. The most important thing is to remember that, after flowering, the leaves have to continue their job of providing food for next year's bloom: don't ... read more at http://www.gardenclips.com/2012/03/13/daffodil/", "title": "Daffodil - Narcissus", "publishedDate": "2012-03-28T18:13:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHImntgFxHY", "description": "realisation : ayo money\n\nsab200star/uzimoney/ayomoney\n\n\nSas feat Zakizak\nRefrain :\nrah rah rah \nallume ct'enculer dans la beuj (jambe) gauche pour que s'battard danse le stanky leg (\u00d72)\nsalope arretes de faire la frappe wallah t'es moche\nbiatch on est derriere ton cul parce que t'es bonne (x2)\n\nCouplet Zakizak :\nLe compte en banque s'croit au cap dadge wallah c la hass\nj'ai peur de  p\u00e9ter un fusible, prendre une kalash  et de faire jack mess\non veut pas le tr\u00f4ne mais les clefs de la salle du tr\u00e9sor\nsur l'\u00e9chiquier le fou est pr\u00eat de la reine j'te fais pas de dessin\nmatric\u00e9 j'ai pris les deux pilules ta3 morpheus\nsi j'me m\u00e9fie c'est normal car la tra\u00eetrise est virus (uuus)\non d\u00e9barque de l'ombre n\u00e9gro r\u00e8gle l'iso\non veut des sous de la llaisca ($) des tonnes de pessos\nattir\u00e9 par la maille et les gros culs\non veut des tass sur les rotules\nque les keufs r\u00f4tissent 33 hot wings plus quelques tenders de la pestu\nde la frappe dans le pesli les petits s'pavanent sans soucis\n14 pige de la t\u00eate o ieps (pieds) en gucci\nvraiment mal barr\u00e9s  finira derri\u00e8re les barreaux\nassumes tes actes dans l'illicite tu connais le taro\non veut des sous des sous des sous un max de dinars    \nles temps sont durs comme une \u00e9rection matinale\n\nX    Refrain :\n\n\nCouplet Sas : \nj'arrive t'as le traque\nje rap tu craques\nmon flow des claques\njte braques tu te braque\nferme ta gueule laisse moi faire mes back Vazy ferme tg S.A S en  come back\ncarrure d'animal je vous gray  jusqu'aux os\ntu veux capturer le mal tu vas finir trizo\nrafale rafale rafale de balles tu peux ranger tes abdo\nles mc jles prend tous un par un jle jure sur la \"T\u00e9 ma m\u00e9r ( t\u00e9te de ma mere)\"\njprend le micro et jdefourailles frere t'es dans la merde\nsourire jusqu'aux oreilles dans la cabine j'ai fait le taff\nsi tu te releves je sors la carabine et ton affaire je passe avec classes\nle style uzy est affirm\u00e9 blue magic music vient tout raffler trop tard pour reculer\nbande d'encul\u00e9 tu peux eteindre ton calumet\njsuis la pour tous vous allum\u00e9 jsuis arrogant ouaii hallucin\u00e9\nway je crois que je vais m'calmer NAAA je dois terminer\nj'suis mort dans le ring et vous \u00e0 la pes\u00e9e\nl'amour rime avec espece en gros t'es moche\nelle a kiffer ce son dans ta caisse un vrai boloss\n \n X  Refrain \n\n\n\n\n\n/FB/ : Sas ksx vitry\n/FB/ : Zakizak Izback\nAyoproduction !!! #2094", "title": "SAS X ZAKIZAK - STANKY LEG (PROD BY KALIXMAN) - (CLIP BY AYO PRODUCTION)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T19:05:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHJhTJYmT3o", "description": "Fishing Industry in Sicily - http://www.sensationalsicily.com \n\nMedieval Fishing off Sicily - The most important fishing industry of the medieval Mediterranean was, arguably, in Sicily, and even there fish played a modest albeit constant role in the food of the island. There were two kinds of fish caught in the fifteenth century, the so-called blue fish, mostly sardines and anchovies that had some limited economic importance in Sicily's export trade, and the white fish, such as John Dory, turbot, sea bass, grouper, comber, etc., which were secondary in economic importance. However, fish had no overall importance in either the diet or the economy of medieval Sicily and the total number of fishermen was few. But the fasting prescriptions of the church assured that fish would always be in demand. In data for the vice-regent from 1415 we see that fresh and dried fish were bought ten days out of the month. On Friday and Saturday, fresh fish, eel, salted little tuna, and eggs were eaten instead of meat.\n\nMessina, Cefal\u00f9, Termini, Trapani, and Palermo were the five fishing centers of Sicily in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, all fishing sardines for the most part. Fish were in seasonal demand and especially during Lent, when church-mandated fasting requirements limited the amount of meat that could be eaten. During the winter, the fishing industry was involved in salting sardines and, especially, tonnina (little tuna, Euthynnus alletteratus).\n\nThe fishermen encircled the shoals of fish with their seine nets and unloaded their catch directly onto the beach. The fish were processed for salting, a small amount perhaps set aside for local cooks of these coastal villages, while the fishermen victualed their boats with bread and wine. Villages of the interior ate freshwater fish from local rivers and streams or eels from the Simeto River near Paterno. In the twelfth century eels were caught in a complicated device called a tarusi, consisting of a series of chambers whereby the eel is unable to turn around and get out.\n\nPalermo was the most important of the five fishing towns in medieval Sicily, and in the fourteenth century the fishermen lived in an area of the city near the sea called the Kalsa. A fisherman's life was a poor and hard one. The Kalsa still exists and even today one finds fishermen, smugglers, and mafiosi (so they say) living there. It was in Palermo where the net- makers were and where most of the fishermen could be recruited.\n\nFishing zones were well demarcated and the fishing of sardines from Termini was the economically most important fishing activity. The zone off Trapani was rich in fish, and we know that agents for the royal kitchen of the Angevin King in Naples, Charles d'Anjou, came here in 1270 to buy dacteri (flying fish?) and cervige (amberjack?). The zone off Messina was known for its swordfish and it still is.\n\nFish were also caught in more rudimentary ways using traditional techniques that go back to the Arab era and earlier. Usually this meant two men in a boat with a net. The Arab influence on Sicilian fishing and nautical affairs in general is attested to by the Sicilian fishing and nautical vocabulary which is thoroughly rooted in the Arabic language. Take, for instance, the Sicilian word xabica, the big fishing net that is attached to shore and moved seaward in a great sweeping swath by a bark, a small sailing ship. The word derives from the Arabic word shabaka, meaning \"net.\" But as some scholars have pointed out, the interplay among Arabo-Berber, Italo-Siculo, Arab, and Turkish cultures was complex enough to find influence a constant two- and even three- way street in the Mediterranean Sea when it comes to nautical matters.\n\nThere were fishermen who used another kind of net called a spiruni which was very thin and expensive to purchase. The archdeacon of Cefal\u00f9 bought three of these nets in 1431. They had eighteen stitchings and cost as much as a ton of fresh fish. Other kinds of nets were the rizza, a bit bigger and made of plaited grass cording, used for larger fish. The nassa was a complicated device used for catching eels or lobster and those fishermen who used them were called nassaroli.\n\nThe business of fishing in Sicily was already an ancient profession and well organized by the fifteenth century. But fishing comprised a whole ensemble of activities that went far beyond fishing. There were instrument makers, cordage makers, fishing zone administrators, packers, haulers, net makers, and salters, as well as the fishermen. Curiously, at the end of the fourteenth century and into the fifteenth century many fishermen came from the tiny island of Lipari off Sicily's north coast.\n\n\"Mattanza: Love and Death in the Sea of Sicily\" by Theresa Maggio\nA writer explores her obsession with an ancient Sicilian ritual steeped in the erotics of killing.\n\nJune 5, 2000 | \"I had found my island, and I wanted to stay forever,\" Theresa Maggio writes in \"Mattanza,\" her valentine to tiny Favignana, off the coast of Sicily, where each spring for several years she witnessed the tonnara, a ritualized tuna hunt dating from ancient times. She's riveted by the mattanza, the moment at which the giant bluefin tuna, having been herded into an elaborate netting system, are hauled one by one onto the fishing boats and killed. In the process of documenting the history and customs of the tonnaroti, the tuna fishermen, Maggio lays bare her own quest to become part of life on the stark, beautiful island. Her quixotic desire is to be more than a tourist, more than a journalist -- to become a member of Favignana's eccentric cast of characters herself. \n\nMaggio finds the ritual hunt close to mythical, with its songs and invocations, its bloody celebration of \"the wheel of life, death and rebirth.\" The traps are set to take advantage of the bluefin's yearly migration to the Mediterranean to spawn, and Maggio dwells lovingly on this fusion of sex and death: \n\nIt is possible that some of the captured tuna that swims into Favignana's trap began life there when their parents, in a last-ditch effort to procreate, ejected their sperm and eggs as they were being killed. Sex, death, and begetting mingle in this briny vessel of primordial juices.\n\nShe's obviously turned on by the erotics of hunting and killing.gustibus non est disputandum, I guess, but she lost me as she worked this theme. At one point, having gotten a strikingly masculine tonnaroto into her bed, she seizes the chance to ask the burning question: \"How does it feel to kill a giant bluefin with your bare hands?\" He's not impressed with the direction their pillow talk is taking, and she never gets an answer. \n\nScenes like that have an appealing element of self-deprecation; but in the end Maggio's self-exposure undermines the more serious aspects of her project. There's a neediness to the way she longs to be accepted by the tonnaroti, not to mention the women and older men in Favignana's piazza and cafes. In many ways she's butting her head against a wall, and she knows it. There's no easy social slot for her to fit into in Sicily, no place for an unmarried, independent woman in her late 30s who bicycles around town and crouches in boats, scribbling notes as the tonnaroti work. Again and again she's asked, \"Why don't you get married and quit writing books?\" The Favignani are warm and generous to her, and she does achieve her fondest hope when the rais -- the distant, autocratic leader of the tuna hunt -- tells her, \"You are a tonnorota, a member of the crew.\" I'm sure it was a heartfelt moment, but she should know that Italians are prone to extravagance. The truth is, she'll always be a bit of a freak to them. \n\nBy not acknowledging the tension between the ways she feels accepted and the ways she'll never truly fit in, Maggio ends up sentimentalizing the Favignani and their vanishing way of life. Her account of the history of the Sicilian tuna fishing industry suffers from a similar tendency to gloss over ugly realities. She has done plenty of research, but the overall picture is so idyllic, with centuries of beloved, benevolent bosses and humble, satisfied workers, that it strains credulity. And while I'm as annoyed as the next Italian-American by knee-jerk references to the Mafia in discussions of anything Italian, come on -- there's not one mention of La Cosa Nostra in this book. Did this single corner of Sicily really remain pure? \n\nMost disturbing, Maggio lets emotion color her treatment of complicated issues, notably the role of the Japanese in the tuna fishing industry. She casts them as wily, ruinous intruders whose interest in the time-honored rituals of the tonnara is not as pure as hers and whose taste for tuna meat is somehow deplorable. (\"It was only the insatiable appetite of the Japanese for bluefin that kept the Favignana tonnara afloat in recent years ... The Japanese waited with sharp knives at Castiglione's slaughterhouse for the Chamber of Death to give up its fruit.\") She's angry at a Japanese film crew for filming the mattanza and getting \"the royal treatment\" from the rais, \"close to tears\" when they're invited onto the boat one day and she's not. It's a tricky issue; I'd have liked less of Maggio's schoolgirlish resentment and more information on the politics of the tuna industry and the choices facing the tonnaroti. \n\nLuckily, the Favignani resist Maggio's wish that they be either larger than life or less than complexly human. In the end, they emerge from \"Mattanza\" as people blessed to live in a naturally sumptuous place, hanging on to what they can in a world that's less and less under their control. \n\nMattanza\n  \nFor hundreds of years, fishermen in Sicily and Sardinia have used dense nets to capture the Mediterranean bluefin tuna (thunnus thinnus) in a quasi-spiritual procedure known as the mattanza. This takes place in May and June, when the giant fish swim past the coasts. In Sicily, the few remaining mattanzas take place off the island's western point among the Egadi Islands. The term \"mattanza\" comes to us from an old Spanish word, matar, meaning \"to kill.\" Many terms, such as rais (head fisherman of the mattanza), are actually Arabic in origin, introduced in the ninth century when, during the Arab domination of Sicily, the technique became popular. There are indications, however, that it is much older, possibly originating, in some form, in the Phoenician or Carthaginian era. Averaging over two hundred kilograms (over four hundred pounds), the fish are now popular in the Japanese market, where the delicious red meat is used in sashimi and sushi. It must be said that this fresh tasty meat is a breed apart from the bland whitish stuff sold in cans. Bluefin, many of which escape into the Atlantic, may also be consumed young.\n\nThe keys to a successful mattanza, apart from the obvious questions of supply (overfishing has reduced the number of larger tuna in recent years) and weather, are organisation and technique. A series of vast nets are lowered into the water. The tuna are captured in successive nets which are gradually restricted in size and raised toward the surface, where the fish are attacked with what might be described as large spears in a sophisticated trap system.\n\nReaching 4.3 meters (14 feet) in length and weighing as much as 800 kilograms (1800 pounds), the bluefin is the largest tuna, surpassing the skipjack, albacore, yellowfin and bigeye. Unlike these other worldwide species, the bluefin lives in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.\n\nThe network of net chambers is called an isola (island). One of the interesting things about the mattanza is the team effort of the numerous fishermen involved in each catch. From his boat, the rais directs the work of the men in the other small boats. Because a mattanza is the catch of an entire school of fish, dozens of tuna may be captured. The ambience of bloody water and particularly large fish, which may be compared to cattle or large game, leaves one with a singular impression. There's nothing like watching the fish struggle as they are herded into ever smaller, shallower net chambers (the final one is called the \"chamber of death\") and finally lifted onto the boats. Indeed, the term mattanza has found its way into the Italian vernacular as a synonym for \"massacre.\"\n\nJust how long the mattanza itself survives remains to be seen. As time passes, the tuna are diminishing in size and numbers, while demand increases in world markets. This has prompted legal restrictions. A hundred years ago, there were dozens of small \"tonnare\" (tuna canneries) along the Sicilian coasts, though the word \"tonnara\" originally referred to the complex series of nets used in tuna fishing during the mattanza. The occupation of tuna fishing was more widespread, with hundreds of tonnarotti (tuna fishermen) throughout Sicily. Tunny fishing has usually been a seasonal profession in Sicily, with the tonnarotti catching other fish during the autumn and winter.\n\nBreaded fried tuna steaks are a traditional Sicilian specialty. Tuna steaks are also good simply grilled. For something different, try it \"Japanese-Sicilian\" style --raw sprinkled with varietal extra virgin olive oil and freshest lemon juice.", "title": "Sicily Fishing", "publishedDate": "2007-07-21T02:03:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHJrFk4lLqI", "description": "Pashto Saaz, Wedding Saaz.

Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a \"sense of humour.\"\nThe term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which stated that a mix of fluids known as humours (Greek: \u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, chymos, literally juice or sap; metaphorically, flavour) controlled human health and emotion. (This theory has since been found to be counterfactual.)[citation needed]\nA sense of humour is the ability to experience humour, although the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence, and context. For example, young children may possibly favour slapstick, such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or cartoons (e.g., Tom and Jerry). Satire may rely more on understanding the target of the humour, and thus tends to appeal to more mature audiences. Nonsatirical humour can be specifically termed \"recreational drollery.\"[1][2]", "title": "Samo Soviet - Angelica's House Criss Talents On Guitar", "publishedDate": "2009-07-10T08:46:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHMLNdoclOg", "description": "Alpna's Water Cooled curing system for Rotogravure presses installed on Offline Lamination Machine.", "title": "Watre Cooled UV Curing System for Rotogravure Press", "publishedDate": "2013-10-10T07:33:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHMQqMpcGc4", "description": "Imprime esta receta en: http://cocinaycomparte.com/recipes/quiche-de-brocoli-y-tomate-cherry--2\nSuscr\u00edbete a este canal: http://bit.ly/10nAF2t\nGRATIS Baja tu APP para Android y iPhone: http://cocinaycomparte.com/blog/estrenamos-app-movil#.Uu6P6PmSySo\nDescubre recetas nuevas: http://cocinaycomparte.com/\nS\u00edguenos en Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/CocinaAlNatural\nS\u00edguenos en Twitter: http://twitter.com/cocinaalnatural\n\u00danete a Google+: http://plus.google.com/117464414297243244897/posts\nS\u00edguenos en Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/cocinaycomparte/", "title": "Quiche br\u00f3coli y tomate cherry - Bocoli and tomato quiche - Recetas de cuaresma- C\u00f3mo preparar", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T23:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BHMSjwUhgyA", "description": "Brahmakamal flower blooming.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "What A Concept !!!!

are an order of highly derived ray-finned fish, also called the Plectognathi. Sometimes these are classified as a suborder of the Perciformes. The Tetraodontiformes are represented by 10 families and about 360 species overall; most are marine and dwell in and around tropical coral reefs, but a few species are found in freshwater streams and estuaries. They have no close relatives, and descend from a line of coral-dwelling species that emerged around 40 million years ago.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontiformes\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nAmerican_whitespotted_filefish.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontiformes\n\n250px-Arothron_mappa_colour_corrected.jpg from http://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontiformes", "title": "All About - Tetraodontiformes", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T07:26:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI0KE3lN0Po", "description": "", "title": "Spetter de spatter met Jip. vagabond-pets.com", "publishedDate": "2012-07-25T11:30:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI0P1KC1QBg", "description": "Retained placenta in Cow", "title": "Retained placenta in Cow", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T11:46:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI0TbsISb4k", "description": "First day of bottling at Artesian Well", "title": "Water Bottling Plant", "publishedDate": "2012-03-18T22:01:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI0lsk0EjfE", "description": "A Mighty Wind Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/PiMrtd\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nTerry (John Michael Higgins) and Laurie Bohner (Jane Lynch) discuss their unconventional upbringings and recall how they met one another.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Warner Bros.

Bloom, Karen Murphy\nScreenwriter: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy\nFilm Description: The writing and directing team who created Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show turn their satiric eye toward the world of folk music in this sly mockumentary. Irving Steinbloom was one of the great behind-the-scenes figures of the folk music boom of the late '50s and early '60s, and helped to nurture the careers of three of the best known acts of the era. The Folksmen -- Mark Shubb (Harry Shearer), Alan Barrows (Christopher Guest), and Jerry Palter (Michael McKean) -- were an earnest folk trio who sang of America's noble past and the challenges of the future; they split up in the early '70s after a failed attempt to go electric. Mitch & Mickey were a duo in both music and life, comprised of Mitch Cohen (Eugene Levy) and Mickey Devlin (Catherine O'Hara). They sang soulful songs of love until the collapse of their relationship sent Mitch into a deep and incapacitating depression. And The Main Street Singers were a nine-piece vocal group -- a \"neuftet,\" as they prefer it -- who offered energetic good-time music, cranking out nearly 30 albums in the course of a decade; their current incarnation, The New Main Street Singers (played by Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, John Michael Higgins, David Alan Blasucci, Steve Pandis, Christopher Moynihan, Paul Dooley and Patrick Sauber) is still on the road. When it is announced that the legendary Irving Steinbloom has died (the character never appears in the film), his son Jonathan (Bob Balaban) decides that the best way to memorialize his father is through music, and with the help of Mike LaFontaine (Fred Willard) of Hi-Class Management, they set out to bring The Folksmen, Mitch & Mickey, and The New Main Street Singers back together for a special concert at New York's Town Hall. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer -- who previously teamed up for This Is Spinal Tap -- not only perform together as The Folksmen in A Mighty Wind, but composed most of the songs performed onscreen.\n\n\"a mighty wind\",\"a mighty wind clip\",\"a mighty wind trailer\",\"a mighty wind what happened\",\"john michael higgins\",\"jane lynch\",\"cameron sprague\",\"christopher guest\",\"record videos\",\"table videos\",mockumentaries,comedies,musicals,satires,\"showbiz musicals\",\"karen murphy\",\"donna e bloom\",\"experience videos\",\"family videos\",\"independence videos\",\"sex sensuality videos\",\"amusement park videos\",\"young terry bohner\",\"laurie bohner\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++278224,/m/07m77x,/m/07y8l9", "title": "A Mighty Wind (2/10) Movie CLIP - The Bohners (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-20T01:30:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI18iT6jWNI", "description": "Crutch walking on stairs with partial or touch-down weight bearing status.

I still think it is right if we can find a way of putting this in place. I think it is an important idea.\n\n\"As for Eric Joyce, I think this is going to have to be properly looked at. I'm sure that the authorities, both inside and outside of the House, are more than capable of doing that.\"\n\nMr Joyce resigned from the Labour Party after headbutting Tory rivals Stuart Andrew and Ben Maney in a different Commons bar called Strangers' Bar, last February, where the average cost of a pint of beer is \u00a33.30 and a glass of red wine \u00a32.88.\n\nOn that occasion the 52-year-old also punched Tory councillor Luke Mackenzie and Labour whip Phillip Wilson and insulted police officers. After leaving Mr Andrew with a bloodied nose, Mr Joyce told police: \"He deserved it.\"\n\nMr Joyce, who accepted he was \"hammered\" on red wine during the brawl, launched into a frenzied attack after shouting that the Strangers' Bar \"was full of ******* Tories\".\n\nThe former soldier walked away from Westminster Magistrates Court with a fine and pub banning order after admitting four counts of common assault. He was fined \u00a33,000 and ordered to pay \u00a31,400 to victims after he entered early guilty pleas.\n\nMr Joyce was also given a 12-month community order - banning him from entering pubs and licensed premises for three months - and imposed with a curfew order from Friday to Sunday.\n\nAfter the hearing, he admitted he was lucky not to be jailed and said he was \"deeply apologetic\".\n\nMPs are automatically expelled from their seats if they receive a jail term of more than one year.\n\nMichael Connarty, MP for Linlithgow & East Falkirk, suggested Mr Joyce's problems may stem from his time in the armed forces.\n\n\"I think he is a perfect example of combat stress,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"I have dealt with people who go through combat stress here in Scotland, who are basically ... exactly like Eric, who have come out of the armed forces, not really fitted into civilian life ... excess alcohol intake, they've lost their families, lost their homes ... have been rehabilitated - but they have to give up alcohol to do that ... I think Eric has that problem.\"\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said police were called shortly before 10.30pm \"to reports of a disturbance at a bar within the House of Commons\".", "title": "Alcohol Ban On MP After Bar Fight", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T17:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI545oP0oEI", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez un nouvel \u00e9pisode de La Boutique de Minnie, sur Disney Junior  !\n\nRetrouvez Nous:\nsur Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/DisneyJuniorFR\nsur le site officiel : http://www.disney.fr/disney-junior/\n\nBienvenue dans la toute nouvelle boutique de Minnie, remplie de noeuds de toutes sortes !", "title": "La Boutique de Minnie : La Machine \u00e0 Rubans - Episode en entier | HD", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T12:31:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI5LoG0C74Y", "description": "Citizin (baptitoksin, soforin) je toksi\u010dni alkaloid koji se prirodno javlja u nekoliko biljnih rodova, kao \u0161to su Laburnum i Cytisus iz familije Fabaceae.

He studied organ with Lagergren and composition with Dente at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and then joined the faculty there, where he taught harmony (1908-24) and then organ (1924-45). He was also the organist at the Gustav Vasa church in Stockholm. He became a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Music in 1915.\n\nHe used his strong background in counterpoint, combined with an affinity for French organ music, to create his late Romantic style of composition. He also had an interest in earlier music and used the plainchant techniques of Gregorian chant in his Gregorianska melodier. He explored polytonality in his work, an advancement not found in other Swedish works of the time. In addition to many fine works for the organ, instrumental and choral works, his best-known work is his setting of the Te Deum, a large piece for chorus, string orchestra, harp, and organ.\n\nAs a teacher, he influenced many Swedish church musicians, and he was important in the development of church music in Sweden, which had suffered a long period of decline, having served as a member of official committees that supervised the liturgy and hymnology. He also composed Psalm settings for congregational use and wrote two instructional books, on the art of choral singing and psalm singing.", "title": "Otto Olsson - Rex Gloriose Martyrum (8/8)", "publishedDate": "2010-10-28T16:40:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI8XNwdLa-w", "description": "Produced by Graphic Enterprises", "title": "Fair at New Boston Jack Salt and The Captain's Daughter", "publishedDate": "2010-09-19T20:58:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BI9UUQqDyeU", "description": "Intermittence de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'ombre d'une bougie.\nLa profondeur en peu de mots. \n\nIci encore, pour les oreilles attentives : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTiS7kuzUkw&list=PLmfiCnVD2LL5ZK37RicV59FWTW19gJJom\n\nle ch\u00eane parlant :\n\nhttp://lecheneparlant.over-blog.com/2014/05/la-culture-euphorique-par-raphael-enthoven.html", "title": "Imaginez !  par Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven - Le savoir -  Arte - 29 avril 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T06:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "BIA4RegyUFA", "description": "Very, very easy with this party.

The turtle is flapping its limbs in the sand, in order to dig a hole for laying its eggs, on a moonlit night, on the Rushikuliya beach.\n\nThe olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), also known as the Pacific ridley, is a species of sea turtle. The olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous, especially in immature stages of the life cycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or estuarine habitats. Common prey items include jellyfish, tunicates, sea urchins, bryozoans, bivalves, snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. Sphoeroides) and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding . The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources . Captive studies have indicated some level of cannibalistic behavior in this species.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Oral herpes, which can show up asfever blisters or cold sores near or on your mouth or even sores inside your mouth, can be caused byherpes simplex virus type 1 or HSV-1. This type ofherpes infection can be spread if there is direct contact with the sores, like when kissing. Herpes simplex virus type 2 or HSV-2, on the other hand, is the most common cause of genital herpes. This can show up as sores or blisters on the genitals. If you have never had this type of infection before, you will be vulnerable and you are likely to contract the virus once you have sex with one contagious partner.\nIf you're a pregnant woman, you can get genital herpes if your partner has oral herpes and he performs oral sex on you.\nWhat happens once you are infected?\nAs soon as you contract the virus, it will settle in the nerves near your spine for a long, long period of time. And this can surface again anytime. Some carriers of herpes always have outbreaks while other carriers only have rare outbreaks.\nYou may not be able to notice the herpes symptoms when it comes back, thus, it won't be easy for you to know if you already have one. This could be a big problem during these times, you are shedding virus. This means that you are contagious and you can infect your partner as soon as you have sex or you can infect your baby during labor and once you give birth.\nAlthough herpes can't be cured, there are some ways that you can try in order to treat it. What you should do is to have a caregiver and let him or her know if you or your partner had a herpes outbreak before.\n\nCan zeolite get rid of herpes", "title": "Can zeolite get rid of herpes - No more uninterested doctors.", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T04:38:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BIZOsTWBw0M", "description": "Best freshwater aquarium fishes\nhttp://www.bangaloremania.com\n\n\"freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"aquarium fish\"\n\"freshwater aquarium\"\n\"saltwater aquarium fish\"\n\"aquarium fish for sale\"\n\"freshwater fish aquarium\"\n\"aquarium freshwater fish\"\n\"best freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"cool freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"rare freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"types of freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"tropical freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\"freshwater aquarium fishes\"\n\"large freshwater aquarium fish\"\n\n http://youtu.be/BIZOsTWBw0M", "title": "Best freshwater aquarium fish", "publishedDate": "2013-12-23T09:22:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BIZUn_TR1dA", "description": "*Hope You Enjoyed!*\n\n?
