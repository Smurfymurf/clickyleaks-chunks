Measures that could refurbish the lost measurements were necessitated by the lack of width of the remaining alveolar ridge. Here we report the successful direction of foreseeable osseointegration therefore realized and this kind of state wherein positioning of implant was made possible by positioning of autogenous bone block graft got in the mandibular symphysis area.\n\nThe access to sufficient bone quantity for dental implant positioning is frequently reduced by injury, pathology, periodontal disease, and tooth reduction.\nGrafting with autogenous bone was documented to be tremendously successful in supplying biomechanical support for the positioning of dental implants, restoring esthetics and re-building jaw human body. The use of block autografts is suggested mainly when an increase in ridge quantity is wanted, particularly within implant website development.\n\nBefore dental implants can be set into the area whatever the donor site for autogenous blockgrafts, 4-6 months of healing is required. This staged technique using autogenous bone blocks picked at the time of operation is the most often employed grafting technique due to the general clinical achievement and predictability in implant website development.\n\nImplant positioning in augmented regions have reported achievement speeds and high survival, with minimal bone reduction. The claim presented in this post clinically presents the effectiveness of using a block graft for dental implant positioning in the area of right maxillary central incisor.\n\nMandibular block grafts for alveolar ridge augmentation have now been used widely with great success and contain the ramus and symphysis buccal ledge as donor sites. This paper concentrates on using block grafts for alveolar ridge augmentation with osseointegrated implants in order to avoid the biomechanical and biological justification for his or her use and achievement, and esthetic and practical complications. There seem to be biological edges for alveolar ridge augmentation with block bone taken from your mandible. Cortical bone includes considerable concentrations of bone morphogenic protein for osteoinduction. Moreover, it is often indicated that bone in the maxillofacial skeleton includes growth factors in great concentration which will allow for improved graft incorporation. Studies show that block grafts of specific embryologic beginning may lead to bone healing.\n\n\nTo learn more about Sinus lifts and gum grafting for dental implants in Thailand please contact us\n\nPHONE NUMBERS\nThailand +66 94 837 8635\u00a0\nUSA and Canada +1-347-450-8424\u00a0\n\nONLINE\nEMAIL: Help @ Dentalimplantsthailand.org\nSKYPE: Thai.Dental\u00a0\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/dentalimplantsthailand\u00a0\nYOUTUBE: http://www.youtube.com/user/DentalImplantsThai\u00a0\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/caringdentista\n\nPOSTAL ADDRESS\nDental Center of Thailand\n808/8 Tararom 2, Sukhumvit 55 FL3\nBangkok, Thailand 10110", "title": "Dental Grafting Block Autografting Using Localized Ridge Augmentation at Dental Center of Thailand", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T12:37:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VOWxbqdg8U", "description": "Inscrivez vous sur http://JeTrouveMaVoie.com pour suivre ce d\u00e9fi incroyable !", "title": "Ne cours pas, c'est \u00e0 toi m\u00eame que tu dois arriver...", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T15:09:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VOX4wRguiE", "description": "Video Topics: What is a Trade Line?

I have done nothing to finish, but wipe down.  Left with natural patina.  Clock is in running condition.  Very nice finish, minor scratches, little to no tarnishing. \n\nThe top bracket that holds the works in place was replaced, not original, but shiny brass and looks good.  Clock now runs great.  Strikes on the half hours and strikes the # of hours.  Both springs feel good with key, but in barrels so can not visually see.\n\nWhite clock face with black numbering and gold plate around.  This is a mercury pendulum, not an imitation.   A real mercury pendulum goes for over $200 by itself.\n\n  Impressed seal on back of clock says \"Japy, Freres &C\", and then not legible.  Also says \"85866\" above seal and then \"4\" and then an \"8\" at bottom of works.  Beveled glass is in great shape.   Comes with key.  Dimensions are 10\" high by 5.5\" long by 4\" wide.  Let us know if you have any questions or need additional pictures.\n  \nAs can be expected when dealing with an antique clock, some adjustments may be needed after shipping to get the clock re-running correctly again.  Please ask any questions relating to this matter, before you decide to purchase it.\n\n  We find new homes for many clocks/watches, both new and old.

It is fractal because it can be found everywhere, on every order of magnitude, interconnected with everything else.\n\nFor this project I attempted to create something interconnected and greater than the sum of its parts, something that operates on different orders of magnitude, and something that is a symbol of life.\n\nUsing a doll as a model I had friends, family and strangers draw dozens of pictures of a baby. Like the diversity of animals in the wild, or grasses on the prairie, I had a multitude of different concepts, interpretations, and techniques of what the baby looked like in two dimensions. In an ecosystem countless life forms are united as one great, complex, living system, greater than the sum of its parts. I attempted to use all of the drawings of the baby to create one thing with more depth than any one of the other things individually. I scanned the drawings and entered them into a 3D imaging program online to generate one three dimensional baby from three dozen distinct two dimensional ones.\n\nBiodiversity is in the lining of your stomach and the surface of your skin. It is the ecosystem formed by the mice in your walls, the crumbs on your floor, and your prowling cat. It is the food chain of the Serengeti, but it is also the food-sourcing of your Big Mac. Furthermore, resilience in diversity goes beyond biology, into humanity and technology. The multitude of cultures in a classroom counteract parochialism like a healthy garden prevents infestation. The varying infrastructure of a city facilitates transportation and mitosis with complexity and grace tantamount to that of a cell. And, in this example, artificial intelligence brings together multiple flat ideas, created by differing views and techniques, and creates one resilient, deep, interconnected idea - the baby in three dimensions.\n\nUnfortunately, the program did not draw enough links between the drawings, and no one three dimensional baby was fully formed. The fact is, there was not enough population and diversity of drawings to provide the ground for the 3D image. With enough diversity, the baby could take on life, form and grace, like an old oak tree, or the louisiana bayou. The crucial thing is, the baby would only become more real and more vivid, the more people added their own renditions into the mix.", "title": "Let's make a baby", "publishedDate": "2011-03-03T15:44:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VUpvw9mwA4", "description": "Splenectomy in a 40 yr. old patient -Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome (from Malaria Endemic Area) at Lifeworth Hospital ,Bhawanipatna,Orissa,India By Dr. SUSANTA BEHERA,MS,FAIS,FMAS(DELHI)..Consultant-Gen.& Lap.

Brancato, Michael Ferris\nFilm Description: The fourth installment of the Terminator series follows an adult John Connor (played by Christian Bale) as he attempts to organize a human resistance force which could prove to be mankind's last true hope in the war against the machines. Opening in the year 2018, Terminator Salvation finds John Connor's certainty about the future shaken by the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), whose last memory is of sitting on death row and awaiting execution. Unable to determine whether Marcus was sent from the future or rescued from the past, Connor begins to wonder whether there is still any hope left for the human race as the robots grow more powerful and aggressive than ever before. It appears that Skynet is preparing a devastating final attack designed to eliminate the human resistance once and for all, leaving Connor and Marcus with no choice but to strike back at the cybernetic heart of Skynet's operations. Once there, the two battle-scarred soldiers discover a devastating secret regarding the potential annihilation of all humankind. Anton Yelchin fills Michael Biehn's shoes as a young Kyle Reese in the first installment of a planned Terminator trilogy from director McG (Charlie's Angels).\n\n\"terminator salvation\",\"terminator salvation clip\",\"terminator salvation trailer\",\"terminator salvation theme\",\"anton yelchin\",\"sam worthington\",jadagrace,mcg,\"car videos\",\"gun videos\",\"robot videos\",\"shotgun videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"mario kassar\",\"andrew g vajna\",\"joel b michaels\",\"moritz borman\",\"thomas hayslip\",\"peter d graves\",\"chantal feghali\",\"steve gaub\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++398155,/m/08gfnp,/m/040696", "title": "Terminator Salvation (4/10) Movie CLIP - Blown Cover (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T18:43:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VekvbAgMAc", "description": "Jon Hope \nCamp St. & Comstock \nProduced by Drum Gahd\nVisual Directed by Colby Blanchet \nOff the Upcoming Project \"A Guy Named Harry\"\n2014", "title": "Jon Hope - Camp St. & Comstock (Edited) Dir. by Colby Blanchet", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T15:56:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VeqySj7sYU", "description": "", "title": "Coyuca de Catalan(La lumbre de tejupilco)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-07T23:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Vfb9CxNuGU", "description": "My friend Tim getting his belated Christmas gift.", "title": "Merry Christmas Tim", "publishedDate": "2010-01-07T02:50:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "3VfsOYyhPkE", "description": "sosuke delivers a heart felt message\n\nCAST\nvoicefag as haruka nanase n sosuke \"yamazakers\" yamazaki\ntootsunnotenoughdere as rin matsuoka\n\noops this one is a little late but happy birthdaaaaaay sosukaaaaaaaay", "title": "The Actual Free - It's Your Birthday, Sosuke", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T18:55:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Vg-bd_jncY", "description": "FIRST DEGREE.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - BITCHING Sponsored In Part - 2007", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:49:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WAu0b9HUac", "description": "Alfred J.

Forecasters predicted a dangerous storm surge with large waves as well as drenching rains capable of causing landslides and flash floods.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said satellite imagery indicates Odile's center made landfall at about 9:45 p.m. PDT near Cabo San Lucas. It said at landfall, Odile had estimated intensity of 125 mph, and an automated station near Cabo San Lucas reported a sustained wind of 89 mph with a gust to 116 mph. The storm was moving north-northwest at 17 mph.\n\nAs howling winds whipped palm trees amid pelting rain outside, people bedded down and used magazines to fan themselves in crowded, stuffy safe rooms. Some did crossword puzzles or listened to iPhones. In one hotel near San Jose del Cabo, power went out not long after nightfall and a generator was keeping minimal lights on.\n\nDenise Mellor, a traveler from Orange County, California, was frustrated about a lack of information about the storm and said she was learning more from her daughter back home than from hotel workers.\n\n\"It's a little bit (unsettling) that we don't have a choice but to sit in here and hope for the best,\" Mellor said. \"So that makes me a little bit scared.\"\n\nMexican authorities evacuated coastal areas and readied shelters for up to 30,000 people.\n\n\"We are going to be hit, do not risk your life,\" warned Marcos Covarrubias, governor of Baja California Sur.\n\nAfter reaching Category 4 strength on Sunday, Odile weakened some to Category 3 but was still a major storm. The U.S. hurricane center warned of possible coastal flooding and rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated amounts up to 15 inches.\n\nOn Sunday, police with megaphones walked through vulnerable areas in Cabo San Lucas urging people to evacuate.\n\n\"I'm leaving. It's very dangerous here,\" said Felipa Flores, clutching a plastic bag with a few belongings as she took her two small children from her neighborhood of El Caribe to a storm shelter. \"Later on we're going to be cut off and my house of wood and laminated cardboard won't stand up to much.\"\n\nAt least 22 airline flights were canceled. Some tourists camped out at the Los Cabos international airport hoping to get out before the storm, but the facility shut down all air operations late in the afternoon.\n\nLuis Felipe Puente, national coordinator for Mexico's civil protection agency, said 164 shelters had been prepared for as many as 30,000 people in Baja California Sur.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect from Punta Abreojos to Loreto.

The train later returned via the Settle and Carlisle, being detached from the train at Hellifield.\n\nBuilt as 5699 in 1936 at the Stanier works in Crewe, the locomotive was named after HMS Galatea. Following nationalisation in 1948, the locomotive was renumbered 45699, and was struck with misfortune in August 1953 after derailing at Wilnecote whilst hauling a passenger train. Although the locomotive had fallen on its side as a result of the accident, it escaped with very little damage and thus returned to service. It's final years, like many for the Jubilee's, were on Liverpool - Leeds - York - Newcastle services.\n\nAfter being withdrawn in 1964 she was stored at Eastleigh Works in December 1964 and remained there until January of the following year when she was moved by rail to Barry Scrapyard, Galatea was rescued in 1980 from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales by the late Brian Oliver and was moved to The Severn Valley Railway originally to provide a spare boiler for preserved sister engine 45690 Leander.\n\nThe locomotive was later moved to Steamtown Carnforth and was given a complete rebuild by the West Coast Railway Company This also included the manufacturing of a new middle driving wheel after her original was cut through after a shunting accident at Barry Island. In the spring of 2013, the locomotive returned to steam for the first time since 1964, and now with mainline registration, has been working her fair share of tours and excursions across the rail network, truly a testament to the skilled and professional nature of the volunteers that worked relentlessly to see this magnificent machine return to working order.\n\nAlso this has been my last railtour of 2013, my time has flown!

La fototerapia o luz ultravioleta es la aplicaci\u00f3n de mediados de la energ\u00eda de onda de luz (ultravioleta-B luz [UVB]) o la luz de onda larga (ultravioleta-A [UVA]).

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "Pujols uncorks 496th homer to center field", "publishedDate": "2014-04-15T09:52:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Wc9QeGU3BQ", "description": "A brief look at the CCNA Program at Lone Star College-Kingwood.\n\nhttp://www.LoneStar.edu/Kingwood", "title": "Cisco Certified Network Associate at LSC-Kingwood", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T20:31:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WcWpKm9ib0", "description": "artist Winfred Rembert at the Hamptons Film Festival, screening \"All of Me,\" The Life of Winfred Rembert\"", "title": "Winfred Rembert at the Hamptons Film Festival, screening \"All of Me,\" The Life of Winfred Rembert\"", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T20:53:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WcY6OUAy1o", "description": "Hamish knows Andy has trouble growing facial hair and so being the great friend he is, reverse-barbers Andy a full beard!

The guilty verdict disqualified Harper for re-election as he was dis-entitled as Prime Minister by the House of Commons.\n \nTABLE OF OFFENCES\n\nCANADA ELECTIONS ACT\n\nhttp://www.elections.ca/res/loi/his/2000/TabOffences_e.pdf\n\n On March 21, 2011 a House of Commons committee ruled that the Harper government was in contempt of Parliament -- an offense against the authority or dignity of Parliament, including disobedience to its commands or libel against it or its Members. Punishment for such an offense may take a variety of forms, up to and including imprisonment.\n\nOn March 25, 2011 the finding of contempt led to a motion of non-confidence introduced by Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff. The NDP and BQ supported them, which resulted in the adjournment of the 40th Parliament of Canada, and made Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government the first to fall on a charge of contempt of Parliament.\n\nAny disregard of or attack on the rights, powers and immunities of the House and its Members, either by an outside person or body, or by a Member of the House, is referred to as a \"breach of privilege\" and is punishable by the House. There are, however, other affronts against the dignity and authority of Parliament which may not fall within one of the specifically defined privileges. Thus, the House also claims the right to punish, as a contempt, any action which, though not a breach of a specific privilege, tends to obstruct or impede the House in the performance of its functions; obstructs or impedes any Member or Officer of the House in the discharge of their duties; or is an offence against the authority or dignity of the House, such as disobedience of its legitimate commands or libels upon itself, its Members, or its Officers.", "title": "Stephen Harper - The Canadian Public Don't Care I Broke The Law", "publishedDate": "2011-03-30T04:01:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WfoccRna6I", "description": "From the early 90's Australian TV show The Money Or The Gun by The Beatnix, Australian Beatles Tribute Band.", "title": "Stairway To Heaven - The Beatnix", "publishedDate": "2007-07-13T11:52:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WgICz4I20c", "description": "", "title": "JJ Watt Box Jump 59.5 inches", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T22:30:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WgKdBELiJU", "description": "", "title": "bedsit holbeck", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T19:01:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WgcipdkwjY", "description": "This is a kinetic sculpture I am working on for my MFA", "title": "Cognate journeys", "publishedDate": "2007-04-25T20:21:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WggHqH5_pc", "description": "", "title": "CIUFFOLOTTO (Pyrrhula pyrrhula)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-30T15:23:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WggWsSQIlM", "description": "", "title": "T\u00e9V\u00e9 Bombina 5", "publishedDate": "2013-10-05T14:48:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3WgnAFEicFY", "description": "", "title": "Automatic Milli Volt Drop Tester 200 A", "publishedDate": "2011-08-03T11:44:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Wgq_LRHyls", "description": "What will be crafted next? \u25ba Subscribe! \u202ahttp://bit.ly/NombieSub\u202c\n\nWe bring the Minecraft crafting table to life with LEGO bricks!

Who leads the hearts of Muslims to calm what torments them and ruins their prosperity. Where is the sense of honor of the Muslims? The pride of the Believers? The zeal of the Faithful? We shall never cease to be amazed at how the disbelievers for their part have shown trusts, and it is the Muslims who have been lacking in zeal. Not one of them has responded to the call. Not one intervenes to straighten what is distorted; but observe how far the Franks have gone. What unity they have achieved. What aims they pursue. What help they have given. What sums of money they have borrowed and spent. What wealth they have collected and distributed and divided amongst them. There is not a king left in their lands or islands, not a lord or a rich man who has not competed with his neighbors to produce more support and rival his peers in strenuous military efforts. In defense of their religion they consider it a small thing to spend life and soul; and they have kept their infidel brothers supplied with arms and champions of war; and all they have done and all their generosity has been done purely out of zeal for him they worship in jealous defense of their faith. The Muslims on the other hand are weakened and demoralized; they have become negligent and lazy, the victims of unproductive stupefaction and completely lacking in enthusiasm. If, Allah forbid, Islam should draw reign, obscure her splendor, blunt her sword there would be no one, east or west, far or near who would blaze the zeal for Allah's religion, or choose to come to the aid of Truth against Falsehood. This is the moment to cast off laziness, to summon from far and near all those men who have blood in their veins; but we are confident [He speaks about himself and the small party of believers who began with him and then became a large party]; but we are confident thanks to Allah- alhamdulillah- in the help that will come from him and entrust ourselves to him in sincerity of purpose and deepest devotion.

Your stance is very important because it is the starting point for all wrestlers. Your stance will always be important when you are wrestling from neutral. It is the #1 most important basic. All your offense and defense will come from having a good wrestling stance and being in good position. \n\nThis is a staggered (also called sugerfoot) wrestling stance. That means leading with one foot in front of the other, if a foot isn't leading, and your feet are on the same plain, that is a square stance. There are a few different stances, but I find this to be the most effective, offensively and defensively. \n\nThe video also talks about stance and movement. It is important you don't cross your feet, and you take short steps when you are in your stance. Also, you want to stay off your heels. \n\nThis video is good for people who are new to wrestling and looking for instruction, for people just beginning or learning wrestling, or for anyone who wants to improve their wrestling basics or fundamentals.\n\nFilmed and edited by www.hoco-photo.com.\n\nRecently, I started a wrestling-based charity.

Will man eine Primula weiterkultivieren, so stellt man sie an einen k\u00fchlen, hellen und luftigen Standort. Fast alle frostempfindlichen Primula bl\u00fchen im sp\u00e4ten Winter und zeitigen Fr\u00fchjahr - bei einigen Sorten treten die Bl\u00fcten aber auch zu anderen Jahreszeiten auf. Jeweils etwa sechs bis zehn der trichter- oder tellerf\u00f6rmigen Bl\u00fcten bilden Dolden oder Quirle an aufrecht stehenden Sch\u00e4ften, die sich zwischen den Bl\u00e4ttern entwickeln.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Primula\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Primula kultiviert man an einem hellen Standort mit einigen Stunden t\u00e4glicher Sonnenbestrahlung.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nMan w\u00e4ssert die Primula reichlich und h\u00e4lt den Topfballen gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig feucht, vermeidet aber stauende N\u00e4sse und entfernt nach dem W\u00e4ssern \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiges Wasser aus dem Unterteller.\nTemperatur\n\nIn Bl\u00fcte \u00fcbergehende Primula stehen am besten bei Temperaturen zwischen 10 und 14 \u00b0C. H\u00f6here Temperaturen l\u00e4sst die Pflanzen schnell verbl\u00fchen. Kultiviert man die Primula in w\u00e4rmeren R\u00e4umen, so sollte man f\u00fcr eine h\u00f6here Luftfeuchtigkeit sorgen. Daf\u00fcr kann man die Pflanzen t\u00e4glich mit einem feinen Wassernebel einspr\u00fchen oder man stellt die Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe in mit Wasser und Kieselsteine gef\u00fcllte Untersetzer.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nAm besten zieht man neue Pflanzen aus Samen heran.\nErde / Substrat\n\nAm besten eignet sich f\u00fcr die Kultivierung dieser Pflanzen ein Erde auf Kompostbasis, der man etwas Rindenmulch zusetzt. Primula liebt generell eine lockere, humose Erdmischung.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nSobald die ersten Bl\u00fctensch\u00e4fte zwischen den Bl\u00e4ttern erscheinen und auch w\u00e4hrend der Bl\u00fctezeit d\u00fcngt man alle zwei mit einem phosphorreichen Bl\u00fctend\u00fcnger.\nHinweise zur Pflanze\n\nDie Bl\u00fctezeit der Primula kann man verl\u00e4ngern, indem man verwelkte Bl\u00fcten sofort entfernt.\n\nMehrj\u00e4hrige Pflege der Primula\nWill man die Pflanzen ein zweites Jahr weiterkultivieren, sorgt man im Sommer f\u00fcr einen gut bel\u00fcfteten, k\u00fchlen und leicht schattigen Standplatz und w\u00e4ssert die Pflanzen gerade so viel, dass der Topfballen nicht austrocknet. Besonders g\u00fcnstig ist ein Standplatz im Freien auf einem schattigen Balkon oder an einem schattigen Platz im Garten.\n\nIm zeitigen Herbst entfernt man dann vorsichtig die vergilbten und abgestorbenen Bl\u00e4tter der Pflanze, topft die Primula in frische Erde und regt die Primula durch leicht gesteigerte Wassergaben zu neuem Wachstum an. Leider lassen sich nicht alle Sorten mehrj\u00e4hrig kultivieren. Am besten probiert man die Weiterkultivierung einfach aus.\n\nMagnesiummangel\nMagnesiummangel kann bei jungen Primula zum Vergilben der Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fchren. In einem solchen Fall gie\u00dft dann mit einer L\u00f6sung aus Magnesiumsulfat. Mischungsverh\u00e4ltnis: In einem Liter Wasser werden 8 Gramm  Magnesiumsulfat gel\u00f6st.\nPflanzensch\u00e4dlinge & Pflegefehler\nBlatt\u00e4lchen\n\nDie Primula neigt zum Befall mit Blatt\u00e4lchen. Die Pflanzen k\u00f6nnen dann meist nicht mehr gerettet werden.\nGewitterfliegen\n\nDie Primel ist manchmal auch Wirt f\u00fcr die Larven der Gewitterfliegen. Die Larven ern\u00e4hren sich bis zum Schl\u00fcpfen von jungen Trieben, sich neu entwickelnden Bl\u00e4ttern und den Knospen der Bl\u00fcten. Der Schaden an der Pflanze wird meist erst nach dem \u00d6ffnen der befallenen Bl\u00e4tter und Bl\u00fcten entdeckt.", "title": "Primeln, Primula", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T22:02:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Wusytgc3KU", "description": "Hadron Kyrie executando a musica do Alto da Pedra no I\u00aa Vem Louvar em Vale dos Lagos.", "title": "Hadron Kyrie - Do Alto da Pedra", "publishedDate": "2013-06-01T16:20:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Wux17TGhL0", "description": "Keith Emerson was a guest star on the Italian national television RAI 1, on November 28th.\n\n\"50 Canzonissime\" is a prime time program featuring the best opening music ever on Italian TV.

Where some companies might have a tubeless option, the Italian company offers three. Today we're going to talk a little bit about their top of the line offering, the Racing Zero 2-Way Fit wheelset:\n\nThe Racing Zero 2-Way can be fitted with both tubeless and clincher tires and the advantages of tubeless are many: they are safer and more comfortable but they also offer loads in performance thanks to their minimized rolling resistance and better traction in the corners. Some might say the ride is similar to a full tubular setup; truthfully the ride feel is original, refined and confidence inspiring.  The Racing Zero 2-Ways also feature Fulcrum's USB hybrid ceramic bearing technology utilizing the best ceramic balls available on the market -- Silicon Nitride.\n\nIn comparison to the ever-popular Racing One, the Racing Zero takes from its race-inspired little brother in overall design and construction save for a carbon fiber hubshell, aluminum axles and the bladed aluminum spokes laced in the Fulcrum patented Two-to-One spoke ratio. 2:1 is designed to balance spoke tension for an overall faster, better riding wheel.  \n\nTubeless is still a relatively green concept in the road market and the reasons why the market has been so hesitant to give tubeless a try, are few. Truthfully, most people are too scared to try something new are simply waiting for a company to release a product that they can claim, kills the clincher.

Consisting of siblings Ronny, Kenny, Larry and Yvonne, they first sang together in 1967 after being asked to sing during revival services at a small church in Freedom, California. Though they had never sung together as a unit, they soon found themselves a popular favorite in churches and concert appearances along the west coast of the United States. Initially, thy were known as The Singing Hinson Family. However, as time and their popularity progressed they became known simply as The Hinsons. Later, they were known as The Original Hinsons to distinguish themselves from Bo Hinsons' group, The New Hinsons now known as The Hinsons.\nYounger brother Larry tells the story behind the Hinsons signature song: \"It was written in 1970, in the downstairs bathroom of a church then called \"The Pentecostal Tabernacle.\" We had been rehearsing songs that Saturday evening and found the necessity to have new material to stage. Ronny disappeared for several minutes, only to return to the church sanctuary brandishing a long fluttering piece of toilet paper. The title of the song was none other than \"The Lighthouse.\" It was first recorded the next year by The Goodmans and then by The Hinsons. Songs of Calvary and Journey Music, (then owned by Rusty Goodman,) co-published the song. Elvis recorded it soon thereafter...\" 'The Lighthouse' quickly became a huge hit in southern gospel and remains one of the most recorded songs in the genre. From 1973 till 1980 The Hinsons were the co-hosts of the popular television show The Gospel Singing Jubilee. Although the Hinsons were an extremely popular touring group with excellent record sales, they were considered radical for their concert style, which was far more ministry oriented than most of the more established professional groups. Always innovators, the group recorded several albums in the mid 1970s with an eclectic mix of songs that weren't considered true southern gospel. Songs like 'Shinin' In' and 'Look what He's done for me,' had a decidedly contemporary feel, while others such as 'This Joy is Mine' had an undeniably country sound.\nThe family disbanded the group in 1988, but Larry Hinson approached their record producer at Calvary Music Group, suggesting a reunion project involving the original four founding Hinson members. They reunited one final time for One More Hallelujah which was completed in the fall of 1992. The album featured the song \"Joy Comes In The Morning,\" and spurred the 13 city One More Hallelujah Tour in 1993. The tour was cut short when lead singer, Kenny Hinson was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He died on July 27, 1995 at the age of 41.\nRonny, the eldest of the Hinson brothers, is a renowned songwriter, having written over 10 #1 songs on the southern gospel charts, and over 100 songs that charted in the top 10. He is also a sought after producer, and continues to perform.", "title": "Hinsons-Keep E'm Burning On.", "publishedDate": "2011-11-07T23:54:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XIYMKWVaG8", "description": "Pr\u00e9sentation rapide d'une antenne Lecher Acmos.\nPour plus d'information http://formationantennelecher.fr\n\nPour acheter ce type d'antenne, vous pouvez consulter le site officiel Acmos http://www.acmos-sbj.com/Accueil.htm", "title": "Antenne Lecher Acmos", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T09:50:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XIpigf4bgY", "description": "Installation of Livefyre on web pags or non-standard blogs.", "title": "Livefyre on webpages or non-standard blogs", "publishedDate": "2011-04-07T03:59:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XIyb1NMZaQ", "description": "Mao announcing the establishment of the People's Republic of China government during the ceremony on Tiananmen Square on October 1st, 1949.\n\n1949\u5e7410\u67081\u53f7,\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u4e3b\u5e2d\u5728\u5f00\u56fd\u5927\u5178\u4e0a\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u6210\u7acb", "title": "Mao Announcing The Establishment of PRC", "publishedDate": "2007-05-15T01:10:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XJ6CtNQb34", "description": "\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441 Irbis Dingo T150", "title": "Irbis Dingo T150", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T07:03:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XJct-zMqOE", "description": "http://www.avomeen.com/ Avomeen's cGMP pharmaceutical testing labs provide formulation development, deformulation, method development/validation, stability/release testing, and extractables analysis.", "title": "Avomeen Pharmaceutical Testing Services", "publishedDate": "2011-11-25T19:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XK2wqc1cr8", "description": "The Other Boleyn Girl Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/wib7vu\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nAfter learning that she will be sent to exile and her marriage dissolved, Anne (Natalie Portman) lashes out at her sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson).\n\nTM & \u00a9 Universal (2012)\nCast: Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Rylance, David Morrissey, Oliver Coleman\nDirector: Justin Chadwick\nMOVIECLIPS YouTube Channel: http://j.mp/vqieFG\nJoin our Facebook page: http://j.mp/tb8OMH\nFollow us on Twitter: http://j.mp/rZzGsm\nBuy Movie: http://amzn.to/ru1clg\nProducer: Scott Rudin, David M. Thompson\nScreenwriter: Peter Morgan, Philippa Gregory\nFilm Description: Adapted from author Philippa Gregory's historical novel of the same name, director Justin Chadwick's atmospheric period drama follows the fierce competition between sisters Mary (Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) to win the affections of Tudor king Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Anne and Mary Boleyn are under pressure from their father and uncle to help maintain the family's rich legacy and ensure their further prosperity by winning the affections of none other than the king of England (Eric Bana). But life in the royal court is far different than it was in the countryside where these two sisters were raised, and before long their bid to earn the love of the king has transformed two once-happy sisters into bitter rivals. At first, it appears that Mary has triumphed in winning the king's favor by becoming his mistress and bearing him an illegitimate child. Despite her early success, however, Mary has underestimated just how clever and cunning her sibling can truly be. Not only does the relentless Anne manage to edge aside her sister in the eyes of King Henry, but she also succeeds in averting his gaze from his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, as well. Mary is driven by genuine affection for King Henry, while her sister Anne has only kept up the charade in a desperate bid to become the queen of England. Now, the growing chasm between two sisters is mirrored on a larger scale as England becomes divided more than ever before. As the consequences of their actions threaten to alter the course of an entire nation, these two sisters will ultimately discover that the only place they will find true strength and loyalty is in family, and that no matter what the consequences they will forever be bound by blood.\n\n\"the other boleyn girl\",\"the other boleyn girl clip\",\"scarlett johansson\",\"natalie portman\",\"david morrissey\",\"mark rylance\",\"oliver coleman\",\"justin chadwick\",\"drink videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",\"united kingdom\",\"scott rudin\",\"david m thompson\",\"betrayal videos\",\"weakness videos\",\"castle videos\",\"mary boleyn\",\"anne boleyn\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++353424,/m/09l3p,/m/02114t,/m/06xh_m,/m/02_53p", "title": "The Other Boleyn Girl (3/11) Movie CLIP - For My Good?

Jimmy Tong (Jackie Chan) is a well-meaning but clumsy New York City cab driver who is tapped by Steena (Debi Mazar), associate to multi-millionaire Clark Devlin (Jason Isaacs), for a new job as Devlin's personal limo driver. After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret -- when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency. The secret to Devlin's success as a spy is his trademark tuxedo, a suit which is loaded with special gadgets which turns him into a high-tech fighting machine. After Tong dons the tuxedo and is transformed into a martial arts master, he takes over for Devlin and discovers that the agent's injuries didn't happen by accident. As Tong tries to chase down a handful of international super-villains bent on world conquest, he has to deal with Devlin's new partner, Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a CSA rookie who is just as baffled by her new assignment as Tong. The Tuxedo marked the feature-film debut for director Kevin Donovan, who had previously won international acclaim for his work in television commercials.\n\n\"the tuxedo\",\"the tuxedo clip\",\"the tuxedo full movie\",\"the tuxedo part 1\",\"jackie chan\",\"romany malco\",\"noah danby\",\"cecile cristobal\",\"kevin donovan\",\"bag videos\",\"bicycle videos\",\"book videos\",\"crowbar videos\",\"hotdog videos\",\"action adventure\",comedy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",thriller,\"walter f parkes\",\"william s beasley\",\"adam schroeder\",\"laurie macdonald\",\"david coatsworth\",\"solon so\",\"john h williams\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++261092,/m/012d40,/m/043slwy,/m/0c861_,/m/0gc3qpy", "title": "The Tuxedo (1/9) Movie CLIP - Just Not My Day (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T03:26:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XKUUwVyoJY", "description": "", "title": "total durchgeknallt 4", "publishedDate": "2010-11-06T12:21:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XKYXmtWQFA", "description": "Tom Sarac from Fluval provides an in-depth look at the aquatic brand's Aqualife & Plant Performance LED lighting system for freshwater tanks.\n\nTo learn more, visit: http://www.fluvalaquatics.com/ca/freshwater/aquarium-lighting/series/aqualife-plant-performance-led/", "title": "FLUVAL Aqualife & Plant Performance LED Lighting", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T22:14:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XKdFQXRO7Y", "description": "Track 23 of 29 - Vicinity of Obscenity.", "title": "System of a Down - Vicinity of Obscenity (Live) @ Rock in Rio 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T00:03:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XKgU9yQfM8", "description": "We're just having fun here.

What is a reverse mortgage & how does reverse mortgage work? Learn about mortgage reverse loans pros and cons and information. \n\nWhat is a Reverse Mortgage?\nA reverse mortgage is a loan that allows senior homeowners to access a portion of their home's equity to supplement their retirement income. The loan generally does not have to be repaid until the last surviving homeowner on title permanently moves out of the property or passes away. At that time, the estate can repay the balance of the reverse mortgage loan or sell the home to pay off the balance. All remaining equity is inherited by the estate. The estate is not personally liable if the home sells for less than the balance of the reverse mortgage loan.\n\nEligibility for a reverse mortgage loan\n\nTo be eligible for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage loan, all homeowners must be at least 62 or older. The home must be owned free and clear or all existing liens would need to be satisfied.  If there is a mortgage balance, it can be paid off completely with the proceeds of the reverse mortgage loan at the closing.\n\nEligible home types\n\nMany home types are eligible: one to four unit owner-occupied home approved townhomes and condominiums and some manufactured homes.\n\nDifference between a reverse mortgage and a home equity loan\n\nWith traditional loans such as a home equity loan, a second mortgage, or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), the homeowner must still make monthly payments to repay the loans. However with a reverse mortgage loan, instead of  making monthly payments to the lender, the homeowner receives payments from the lender.\n\nWith a reverse mortgage loan the amount that may be borrowed is determined by a formula that considers the borrower's age, the current interest rate, and the lesser of the appraised value of the home, sale price or the maximum lending limit. Generally the higher the value of the home the higher the loan amount will be, up to the FHA's maximum lending limits.The loan is typically not due as long as the homeowner lives in the home; however, the homeowner is still responsible for paying real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance. St. Petersburg reverse mortgage specialist will explain benefits of best reverse mortgage lenders in St. Petersburg offering lowest mortgage reverse rates and loans.\n\nWhen the loan becomes due\n\nTypically, the loan does not become due as long as one of the homeowners lives in the home as their primary residence and maintains the home in accordance with FHA requirements such as keeping taxes and insurance current, and maintaining repairs. http://youtu.be/0Dv4Gu4Rk1Q\n\nEstate inheritance\n\nIn the event of death or the home ceases to be the primary residence for more than 12 months, the homeowner's estate can choose to repay the reverse mortgage loan and keep the home or put the home up for sale in order to repay the loan.\n\nIf the equity in the home is higher than the balance of the loan, the remaining equity belongs to the estate.\n\nIf the sale of the home is not enough to pay off the reverse mortgage balance, the heirs or estate will not be responsible for the difference. No other assets are affected by a reverse mortgage. For example, investments, second homes, cars, and other valuable possessions cannot be taken from the estate to pay off the reverse mortgage.

Learn about mortgage reverse loans pros and cons and information.\n\nAvailable loan proceeds\n\nThe amount that is available  depends on many factors, such as: age, current interest rate, and the lesser of the appraised value of the home, the sale price or FHA maximum lending limits. Use our reverse mortgage calculator to estimate how much you could receive.\n\nDistribution of money from a reverse mortgage loan\n\nThere are several ways to receive the proceeds from a reverse mortgage loan:\n\nLump sum -- a lump sum of cash at closing\nTenure -- equal monthly payments as long as the homeowner lives in the home\nTerm -- equal monthly payments for a fixed period of months\nLine of Credit -- draw any amount at any time until the line of credit is exhausted\nAny combination of those listed above.\n\nSt. Petersburg reverse mortgage specialist will explain benefits of best reverse mortgage lenders in St. Petersburg offering lowest mortgage reverse rates and loans.", "title": "St. Petersburg Reverse Mortgage Rates Lenders Loans Companies Banks Services Firms Specialists Help", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T14:54:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XNTbyNm5VA", "description": "Registrata presso STANZETTA RECORDZ\n\nMix e Master by B.I.C.R.\n\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Streets-Spirit/334173313269972", "title": "5.

His words follow:\n\n\"Guys, I have good news! I managed to get in contact with Hidenori Shoji, sound director of the Yakuza series and a notorious member of the RGGStudios. I've explained him everything about the Day of The Dragon and I showed him the link of the forum thread. He said that he would talk about the campaign with Nagoshi and Yokohama, but that he needed time to translate everything. So, apparently, \u9f8d\u304c\u5982\u304f\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa(RGGStudios) will be aware of our efforts.\"\n\nThis is really good news and makes sending in your letters even more important! \n\nThank you to those of you who have taken part so far! If you haven', you still have some time!  \n--------------------------\n\nLinks::\n\nThe \"Day of the Dragon\" Facebook Campaign Page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bringyakuzawest\n\nThe original thread over at the Sega Forums:\n\nhttp://forums.sega.com/showthread.php?514621-08-08-2014-Day-of-the-Dragon\n\nSegalization's article about this:\n\nhttp://www.segalization.com/2014/07/22/fans-start-day-of-the-dragon-campaign-to-convince-sega-to-bring-yakuza-games-to-the-west/\n\nPSNation's article(some good tips for letters in it) :\n\nhttp://www.psnation.com/2014/07/26/only-you-can-help-bring-yakuza-5-to-the-west-do-it-now/\n\nOtaku Gamers UK's article:\n\nhttp://otakugamersuk.blogspot.com/2014/07/psa-day-of-dragon.html\n\nIf any more websites are willing to help out and post something about this, I'll add links as they become available.\n\nIf you're on Twitter and want to help get this out there, try these \nhashtags:\n\n#Yakuza5 #DayOfTheDragon #BringYakuzaWest\n\nSong used in this video was \"Each of their dreams\" by Hyd Lunch, off the Ryu Ga Gotoku soundtrack.\n----------------------------\n\nThe main goal is to send letters to Sega of America, but some people are opting to take it one step further and also mail Japan and/or London.  Here are all three addresses:\n\nUSA:\n\nSEGA of America, Inc.\n350 Rhode Island Street\nSuite 400\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\n\nJapan:\n\nSEGA Corporate\n1-2-12 Haneda\nOhta-ku\nTokyo 144-8531\nJapan\n\nLondon:\n\nSEGA Europe Ltd.\n27 Great West Road\nBrentford\nMiddlesex\nTW8 9BW\nUnited Kingdom\n\n--------------------------------\n\nWe're at the tail end of July in 2014, and there are currently no known plans to localize Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 as Yakuza 5 outside of Japan.  The latest rumor was that Atlus would be localizing it, but that was many months ago.\n\nThis is a great series that fans no doubt want to see continued.  In sort of a last ditch effort to get this game localized, or at LEAST hopefully open a dialogue with SEGA of some sort, myself and various other fans at the official forums have started this letter writing campaign.\n\nThere have been internet petitions in the past and those definitely help, but sending in letters can have more of an impact.  \n\nAfter Yakuza 3 was released and a sizable chunk of the content was missing, some of us sent in letters complaining (in a civil manner).  RubyEclipse, the community manager at Sega of  America at that time, said those letters helped convince Sega to bring us a more complete game with Yakuza 4(the only thing missing was a quiz game called Answer X Answer, they did a great job localizing that game).\n\nSo letters can definitely have a strong impact.\n\nHowever, even with that said, there is no guarantee that anything will happen.  The best we can all do is send something in to show support and hope that Sega decides to take another look at this franchise outside of Japan  \n\nSay whatever you want in your letter, but please keep it civil and try to refrain from making demands.  Show them the respect that we all hope they will show US, the fans, by giving the Yakuza series another go.\n\nThanks!", "title": "\"Day of the Dragon\" (8/8/2014) - Yakuza 5 Localization Campaign", "publishedDate": "2014-07-26T23:31:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XNsXcCKL5U", "description": "at my place kickin it", "title": "dave and fam", "publishedDate": "2009-05-18T12:51:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XORblQHcaI", "description": "Come have a traditional Chinese breakfast food with me, I travel to Zhuhai to deliver a bike early in the morning and have one of my favourite Chinese breakfast foods!\n\nJoin me as I review foreigner friendly foods and restaurants in China.\n\nJoin me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/winstoninchina\nLet's not forget Google Plus: https://plus.google.com/100665053747905002031\nTwitter: @serpentza", "title": "Food for Foreigners - Chang fen (Rice rolls)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-01T10:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XOkdj8Y40Y", "description": "Jewelry artist and teacher, Melissa Muir, reviews and demonstrates how to use the 20-ton Potter USA Hydraulic Press.", "title": "Intro To the Hydraulic Press", "publishedDate": "2011-07-25T20:22:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3XP0oYA8-58", "description": "Se ha inaugur\u00e1do en la sala municipal de exposiciones del Centro Cultural Rigoberta Mench\u00fa la muestra de pintura y escultura titulada 'Halmismos.

It is used to solve some of the harder problems in economics.\n\nSo what is a game?  To have a game, you need at least two players, sometimes called agents, or, if you want to be really crazy, people.  And you need payoffs for the players, you need to define the outcomes they can potentially get depending on how the game unfolds.  And finally, you need rules for the game.\n\nNow, it's not always obvious how people will behave, even with players, payoffs, and rules clearly defined.  That's why game theorists have a number of solution concepts for games, including the dominant strategy equilibrium, the Nash equilibrium, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, the Bayesian equilibrium, and the weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium.\n\nThe most basic solution concept is the dominant strategy equilibrium.  In a game, each player can have any number of possible strategies.  One strategy strictly dominates another strategy if the player is always better off under that strategy no matter what other players do.  If one strategy strictly dominates every other possible strategy a player could take, that strategy is a strictly dominant strategy.  We have a dominant strategy equilibrium when all players play a strictly dominant strategy.\n\nNow let's look at the most famous game in game theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma.  There are two prisoners, prisoner 1 and prisoner 2, and they each have a choice.  They can testify against the other, or they can keep quiet.\n\nIf they both keep quiet, they both get off with a light sentence, which I'll represent with a payoff of 2.  Prisoner 1's payoff is on the left, prisoner 2's is on the right.  If they both testify, they both get a moderate sentence.  I'll represent the moderate sentence by a payoff of 0.  Right about now, keeping quiet is looking like the best option, but there's more to this game.  If one testifies and the other keeps quiet, the one who testified will get off scot free, and the one who kept quiet will get an extremely harsh sentence; they'll throw the book at him.\n\nThink about this game for a moment.  Keeping quiet looks like a pretty good option if both prisoners could promise not to testify.  But these prisoners only care about their own self-interest.  So, both prisoners may tell the other they pinky swear not to testify, but they won't keep that promise.  If prisoner 2 keeps quiet, prisoner 1 is better off testifying.  If prisoner 2 testifies, prisoner 1 is better off testifying.  Testifying is a dominant strategy for both players, so both testifying is the dominant strategy equilibrium.\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma comes up in all sorts of situations.  For instance, instead of prisoners our players could be, say, oil companies.  If both set a high price they can sell for a high price, but each one has an incentive to undercut, in which case he will capture the entire market.  The equilibrium outcome is for each company to charge a low price.\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma isn't the only game with a dominant strategy equilibrium.  Here's a more complicated one.  Can you tell which strategy is dominant?  It's A for player 1, and E for player 2.  So the dominant strategy equilibrium is A, E.", "title": "Intro to Game Theory and the Dominant Strategy Equilibrium", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T03:45:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y1hUNuIBZA", "description": "3D model of the Potassium Channel protein", "title": "Potassium Channels", "publishedDate": "2012-12-02T23:01:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y2ifG7voJY", "description": "This is an educational public service announcement created by student pharmacists for other college students.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "3 Fantastic Ways to Beat Eczema With Out Creams, Lotions Or Pills!", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T12:48:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y4RU3my2RI", "description": "Nuestra mascota topito", "title": "MYOCASTOR COYPUS \"TOPITO\" 2", "publishedDate": "2012-06-09T05:38:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y4c3qi3rFo", "description": "Keeping data and documents accessible while ensuring confidentiality, unalterability and non-linkage.", "title": "The electronic safe for data and documents", "publishedDate": "2012-10-24T07:18:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y5QsXoElmU", "description": "une belle fausse chataigne", "title": "Chataigne", "publishedDate": "2007-10-24T12:57:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Y5SAM91oG4", "description": "Your grandpa thinks he's old because he fought in World War II.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type\n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\nGlobally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES:\n\nThis type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nThe several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nDipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more details - \n\n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n     Nadipathy Centres \n\n1.

Even worse, she doesn't know what company made the mesh implant that's inside of her.\n\nAt this point, the only option Munos has would be to pay for a surgery to have the mesh removed herself.\n\nMunos never thought a simple chore like washing the dishes would be so taxing.\n\n\"On a daily basis I feel like I have the flu. My body hurts, my joints hurt, that's from the chronic infection. I feel like I have sand paper in my stomach,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's so uncomfortable to sit down, stand for long periods of time...everything.\"\n\nShe says the last time she felt well was seven years ago.\n\nBack in 2006 Munos went to the hospital for a basic procedure, but life since then has been anything but basic.\n\n\"Two weeks later, I had to go back into the hospital. I had an abscess in my abdomen. My body was already rejecting the mesh,\" she said.\n\nAdding insult to injury, a clerical error has prevented Munos from restitution and even removal.\n\n\"I've been through four different attorneys and they actually cannot help me because there's not any information that they can get from the hospital of the manufacturer or the mesh,\" she said.\n\nMunos\u2019 battle to get the mesh removed can been seen in a stack of paperwork. The only thing missing to file a proper lawsuit is the manufacturer\u2019s number and bar code from the box her mesh was in before the procedure. Without such information, Munos\u2019 hands are tied.\n\nSeven years and stacks and stacks of paperwork, Munos has nothing but time on her hands, waiting to get well.\n\n\"I can't do anything for myself anymore. I'm 40 years old and I have a lot of life to live,\" she said. \"I need to have surgery to have it taken out before any further damage is done to me. Someone should be held responsible. If that never happens, that's fine. I just want to go on with my life, I want to get better.\"\n\nMunos is getting that helps she needs; a doctor has offered to remove the mesh free of charge, all she would have to pay is the hospital fee.

Good Job Club) is a Japanese light novel series written by Shin Araki and illustrated by Aruya. An anime adaptation of it, produced by Dogakobo, aired between January 10 and March 28, 2013.\n\nShinomiya Ky\u014dya is forced to become a new member of the GJ-bu (lit. GJ Club), an unidentified club that dwells in a room of the former building of a certain school. There he meets four girls: Mao, Megumi, Shion and Kirara. Time flies with these unique girls around. The series follows the everyday, though unusual, antics of this band of friends.\n\nThe anime aired between January 10 and March 28, 2013.\n\nThe light novel series GJ-bu is written by Shin Araki and illustrated by Aruya. It is published by Shogakukan. The first volume was published on March 18, 2010 and the final, ninth - on March 16, 2012. On April 18, 2012, the first volume of the spin-off series GJ-bu Ch\u016bt\u014d-bu (GJ\u90e8\u4e2d\u7b49\u90e8, lit. \"Good Job Club, Junior High School Division\") was published. As of January 18, 2013, four volumes have been published. A special volume, titled GJ-bu Hanamaru (GJ\u90e8\u25ce) was published on March 19, 2013.\n\n\nKy\u014dya Shinomiya (\u56db\u30ce\u5bae \u4eac\u591c Shinomiya Ky\u014dya?)\n    Voiced by: Hiro Shimono\n    Nicknamed as \"Kyoro\", Ky\u014dya is the main protagonist of the series. He has black hair and eyes and he has a muscular build. He is the sole male member GJ-bu, joining the club after being kidnapped by the others. He is a kind and courteous person who is the usual target of the other girls' teasing, frustration and sometimes, their affection as well. Despite his seemingly spineless appearance and behavior, Ky\u014dya seems to have an innate talent in dealing with the opposing sex, like making them skip a beat when he temporarily assumes a more manly and less formal kind of speech or when carefully brushing their hair, a talent he claims he learned upon regularly combing his little sister's hair.\n\nMao Amatsuka (\u5929\u4f7f \u771f\u592e Amatsuka Mao?)\n    Voiced by: Maaya Uchida\n    Mao is the older sister of Megumi and the club's leader. She is a small girl who has brown hair and eyes. She has the habit of biting and picking on Ky\u014dya when she is bored or angry. She can't stand kissing, to the point of carefully choosing shows to watch or books to read without kiss scenes at all and can barely tolerate the idea of a forehead or cheek kiss.\n\nMegumi Amatsuka (\u5929\u4f7f \u6075 Amatsuka Megumi?)\n    Voiced by: Yume Miyamoto\n    Nicknamed \"Megu\", Megumi is the middle sister of the Amatsuka family. She is taller than Mao and has pink hair and eyes. She is a nice girl and is always seen making tea inside the club room. She likes to knit and is the one who knit together the club costumes. She always seems to have a calm demeanor even when everyone else in the club is scared. However, she seems to mind her weight, as whenever it is mentioned, she panics.\n\nShion Sumeragi (\u7687 \u7d2b\u97f3 Sumeragi Shion?)\n    Voiced by: Suzuko Mimori\n    Nicknamed \"Sh\u012b\", Shion is a recognized genius chess player and has many brothers, all recognized as experts in some kind of activity. She has violet hair and eyes and has a low body temperature. As Shion is the sole daughter in her family, she likes to dote on younger girls acting as an older sister to them.", "title": "GJ-bu Character Song OST Soundtrack balance unbalance \u301c\u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u30a6 \u30ce \u30ef\u30bf\u30b7\u301c\uff08\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0 \u305d\u306e2\uff09", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T20:51:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3YNTZkEFRmA", "description": "Dendrite V2", "title": "FFR- Dendrite V2", "publishedDate": "2008-08-29T01:08:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3YOGfsOFyJ4", "description": "SCR and EPA 2010\n\nEPA regulations require all diesel engines manufactured on or after January 1, 2010 to meet lowered NOx emissions standards.\n\n\u2022 Most heavy duty engine (Class 7-8 trucks) manufacturers, have chosen to utilize SCR.

Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms: the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species that will serve as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA. Molecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine.[2]\n\nIn a conventional molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes in the test tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, laboratory strain of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO).[3] This process takes advantage of the fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting bacterial population, and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to as \"clones\". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them.

It is called Troh Bu.\n\n{keywords}\n\n\n\n\nOne just needs to travel 12 kilometers on Nguyen Thi Dinh Road from Buon Ma Thuot City center to get Troh Bu Park in Nieng Hamlet, Ea Nuoi commune of Buon Don district in Dak Lak province, the original wild orchid garden, the destination for orchid lovers.\n\nThe area where Troh Bu is located was a deserted land with devastated forests. However, a person, who loves the forests and the Central Highlands, has spent 20 years in his life to revive it, making it beautiful and charming again.\n\nTroh Bu now in the eyes of tourists, is a landscaped garden with walking paths bendy along the slopes and lake sides. Especially, there is a rich collection of plants, flowers, and wild orchids.\n\nThe owner of the garden, Do Tuan Hung, said with the total area of 2 hectares, comprising of lakes and forests, and the \"hybrid\" climate of the dipterocarp forest, Troh Bu is a wonderful place for wild orchids to grow.\n\nHung, with the strong passion for orchids, called the \"regal flower\", has been going to the forests to look for more precious orchid species, growing in the garden to makes the life more beautiful.\n\nThe visitors to Troh Bu, who are attracted by the hundreds of wild orchid species, call Troh Bu the \"wild orchid museum\", or \"wild orchid reserve.\"\n\nAccording to Hung, there are some 200 orchid species now in the garden, including the precious species of the Central Highlands, such as nghinh xuan, thuy tien trang, que lan huong. Especially, there are giang huong (Pterocarpus macrocarpus) orchids, the symbol of Buon Don Forests.\n\nThrough the misery of 20 years long of rehabilitating the natural forests, orchids now can be grown through the seed regeneration, again.\n\nSince orchids are called the \"regal flowers,\" they tend to be very choosy about the habitat. According to Hung, of the thousands of sprouted plants, only several plants can exist. Therefore, Troh Bu has always been put under a strict protection to facilitate the orchid natural reproduction and population development.\n\nHung wishes that one day, there would be 500 precious wild orchid species in his garden, like the garden of King Tran Anh Tong mentioned in history.\n\nBy that time, Troh Bu garden would become a famous eco-tourism site, while the orchid reserve would be a favorite rendezvous for orchid lovers and serves the excursion and research.\n\nAs for Vietnamese orchid lovers, a natural reserve of wild orchids, to date, remains a far away dream.\n\nThe dream of developing a wild orchid reserve has been applauded by scientists, who say that the reserve not only would help people learn more about Vietnamese orchid species, but also play a very important role in the genetic resources protection and help make Buon Ma Thuot more attractive in the eyes of tourists.\n\n\"Troh Bu will be an open garden welcoming people from all over the world, not only for the family use,\" Hung said.\n\nDNSG\nLink: http://m.english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/environment/93631/troh-bu-eco-tourism-garden-and-the-idea-of-wild-orchid-reserve.html", "title": "Troh B\u01b0 - Bu\u00f4n \u0110\u00f4n - Viet Nam wild orchid conservation garden", "publishedDate": "2014-06-01T15:24:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3YWA0COF8Cw", "description": "Streetlight Manifesto, Live in Q-Bus (Leiden, the Netherlands), 15.08.2010.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Two In The Campagna by Robert Browning", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:57:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "3YaaSq-quvo", "description": "A new study by University of Michigan scientists suggests that the immunosuppressive effect of the drug misoprostol, if given vaginally rather than orally along with RU-486 to terminate a pregnancy, is likely the reason a small number of women taking the two-drug combination have contracted a rare, fatal bacterial infection. \nhttp://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=375", "title": "Off-label use of misoprostol linked to abortion deaths", "publishedDate": "2008-06-17T18:54:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3YaxU6I6yQ4", "description": "A breathtaking incident occurred in Dehradun, where a mother killed her notorious son.

Self-esteem is the way in which we evaluate and score ourselves as human beings. We do this by rating ourself worth, like saying \"I'm not thin enough\" or \"I\"m not intelligent enough\" All the things that we say and about ourselves and to ourselves impacts our perception of our perceived worth. \n\nPeople also build an opinion of themselves based on what popular media is saying, especially what film, TV, music and celebrities say about health, fitness, sexuality and beauty. To have healthy self-esteem and confidence we need to be proactively thinking about the words we speak to ourselves and allow others to say to us also.\n\nFor parents, its crucial that they are aware of the influences that their children are exposed to. Low self-esteem impacts performance and has also been linked to suicide, drug and alcohol addiction and other mental health issues. \n\n For more free videos, connect with us on Facebook http://goo.gl/wdmVA", "title": "SELF-ESTEEM - The truth about Self-esteem - By Luke Havard", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T15:13:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z1PbB3rUEw", "description": "The all-new 2013 Ford fusion parking brake by Thoroughbred ford", "title": "2013 Ford fusion new parking brake", "publishedDate": "2012-09-28T19:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z1oy5r4Tt0", "description": "Voir le film en entier: http://www.filmsdocumentaires.com/films/2370-de-l-influence-des-rayons-gamma-sur-le-comportement-des-marguerites\n\nB\u00e9atrice Hunsdorfer, abandonn\u00e9e par son mari, \u00e9l\u00e8ve seule ses deux filles et se d\u00e9m\u00e8ne pour faire face au quotidien.

It\u2019s a big green plant that grows a lot in the south pacific, it grows wild in Hawaii and is cultivated in Africa. Kava has a very unique, relaxing effect on the body, in fact, you know you have got good Kava when your mouth starts to go numb shortly after drinking it, this is due to its natural anesthetic properties.\n\nKava  is something you can have after work when you want to unwind, in the evening  when you're ready to relax and end your day, or anytime when you\u2019re feeling a little stressed out and want to calm down, ease the nerves and come back into balance. \n\nThis is extra fine ground Kava root from Hawaii and we are going to make a Kava drink out of it. It has been consumed for almost 3000 years in Polynesia the benefits range from muscle relaxation to calming the nerves throughout the body. This is called Piper methysticum is comes from a Greek word meaning intoxicating, so it\u2019s the intoxicating pepper.\n\nSo today we are going to make Kava in the traditional style using cool water and some powdered Kava in a strainer bag,what you do is you take the water, pour it over the strainer bag making sure to get it nice  and wet, as you can see the colour of the water is really light, but once you get the bag in and start squeezing you can see the colour of the water changes. So you\u2019re extracting the Kava into the liquid it\u2019s self.\n\nThis is a fantastic way to unwind and it has a very powerful effect, now it\u2019s not addictive and its not psychoactive its nothing like cannabis and its not going to give you a drunk like alcohol but it is very relaxing and it is very noticeable.\n\nI personally that kava should not be boiled and very hot water should not come into contact with it, cold extractions I think are much better and they are tastier. Hi is a fully grown plant as you can see, it\u2019s a little taller than me, there are two partsof the Kava plant that are used for traditional ceremonies and relaxation products they are the both parts of the root of the plant.\n\nHave some Kava and it will bring you on to Hawaiian time\n\n\nwww.edennuganics.co.uk", "title": "Kava Tea - The benefits and uses of kava", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T12:46:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z2he1iZFRg", "description": "http://www.digitalstormonline.com/\nThe  ASUS GTX 970 STRIX OC  features the company's DirectCU II cooler with a new 0dBa silent mode and the new GM 104 GPU from NVIDIA.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DigitalStormPC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/digitalstormpcs\nTwitch: http://www.twitch.tv/navdigitalstorm\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/digitalstormpc\n\nMusic:\nWRLD - Orbit", "title": "Tech Porn - ASUS GTX 970 STRIX OC Unboxing (4K)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T20:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z2z7zY2yfU", "description": "http://bestpediatricstethoscope.com/ This stethoscope is a favorite among medical practitioners because it gives great performance and it is also durable.

Si usted sufre de una condici\u00f3n de la piel seca, entonces la persona es propensa a sufrir de esta enfermedad. Queilitis angular afecta el \u00e1rea alrededor de la boca y las comisuras de la boca. La piel en estas zonas normalmente dividido debido a la sequedad de la piel y es muy doloroso para abrir la boca. Este art\u00edculo proporciona remedios naturales para ayudar a curar la queilitis angular.\n\n1. Siempre siga una dieta equilibrada.\n\nEs importante seguir una dieta sana y equilibrada para protegerse de una serie de trastornos. La aparici\u00f3n de la queilitis angular se debe a una falta de vitamina B. El problema se puede evitar si se mira lo que come. Una muy buena fuente de vitamina B son las verduras de hoja verde y los productos l\u00e1cteos.\n\nAseg\u00farese de que su dieta diaria contenga estos alimentos ya que el consumo de los mismos se reducir\u00e1 el problema. Vegetales de hojas verdes tambi\u00e9n son altos en fibra y ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar un problema de estre\u00f1imiento tambi\u00e9n. Otras fuentes de alimentos que contienen vitamina B son el h\u00edgado, la carne magra, los cacahuetes, cereales de grano entero, la coliflor, el repollo y las patatas.\n\n2. usted Fortalece el sistema inmunol\u00f3gico.\n\nSi usted sigue una dieta saludable, su sistema inmune se har\u00e1 m\u00e1s fuerte y ser\u00e1 capaz de luchar contra las infecciones bacterianas de la queilitis angular. Las personas con un sistema inmune fuerte son mucho menos propensos a sufrir de esta condici\u00f3n de la piel. En algunos casos, una deficiencia de hierro tambi\u00e9n se encuentra para causar queilitis angular. Consulte a su m\u00e9dico para determinar si su cuerpo carece de este importante nutriente.\n\n3. No lamerse los labios.\n\nEs natural que los humanos lamen sus labios cuando se secan. Pero si usted sufre de queilitis angular debe abstenerse de esta acci\u00f3n como la saliva de la boca, que se extiende sobre los labios, contiene bacterias. Esta bacteria se incrusta en las grietas y la condici\u00f3n empeora y la piel se vuelve m\u00e1s irritados y dolorosos. Siempre evitar el consumo de naranjas y limones, ya que son ricos en contenido de \u00e1cido y agravar\u00e1n la piel y te dejan en un mont\u00f3n de dolor.\n\n4. Mantenga una buena higiene.\n\nCepille sus dientes con regularidad. Mantenga la boca en condiciones \u00f3ptimas para eliminar el crecimiento de bacterias. Sus dentaduras, (si tiene) deben mantenerse limpias y asegurarse de que usted usa las dentaduras apropiadas correctas. Remoje las dentaduras durante la noche en una soluci\u00f3n de una parte de lej\u00eda en diez partes de agua para ayudar a mantenerlos en condiciones de pico y libre de contaminaci\u00f3n bacteriana. Las irregularidades encontradas en las pr\u00f3tesis dentales, promover\u00e1n el desarrollo de la queilitis angular.\n\nEs importante cuidar y curar su queilitis en la etapa temprana. Si usted ha sido una v\u00edctima de esta condici\u00f3n durante un mes m\u00e1s o menos, lo m\u00e1s probable es, su piel tendr\u00e1 cicatrices y esto puede tomar un tiempo para desaparecer. Si usted asiste a la problema de inmediato, usted evitar\u00e1 las cicatrices.\n\nboqueras\nqueilitis angular\nboquera\naftas bucales tratamiento\naftas bucales causas\nporque salen boqueras\nherpes bucales\nboqueras causas\ncurar boqueras\nqueilitis angular tratamiento\ntratamiento para aftas bucales\ncomisura de la boca\nboqueras remedios\ntratamiento para la\nboqueras remedios caseros\nporque salen llagas\ntratamiento para las aftas\ncomisuras de la boca\nremedios para la\nboquero\nremedios para las aftas bucales\ncrema para boqueras\nboquera tratamiento\nremedios para aftas bucales\ntratamientos para\nremedios para llagas\nremedio para boqueras\nhongos unas\nporque sale boquera\ntratamiento de la\ntratamiento boqueras\ncurar boqueras rapido\nqueilitis angular pdf\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3Z3dPUStOHM", "title": "4 Tips para Curar las Boqueras, Queilitis angular, o Perleche", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T16:50:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z4T-HmeJCQ", "description": "Hi everyone rin here bringing you the best songs From Sketchbook\nHope you like It and always cheer up and have a great day\nand Rock on Sket dance !!!!!!!!!!\n^//w//^", "title": "Sketchbook (clover)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-26T09:22:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Z4YSFhAg1c", "description": "Land Use Plan open house for the Mikisew Cree First Nation.
