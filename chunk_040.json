The ICE is charging the battery bank of a hybrid car / vehicle by thermoelectric generators powered by waste heat of both exhaust gases and cooling system of the ICE.\n\nThe operation of such a power train is controlled by a hybrid strategy and / or controlled, wherein the hybrid strategy in response to a driver's request and / or determined as a function of an operating point of the power train operation mode, based on control of which the operation of the drive train and / or regulated is.\n\nIn such a mode of operation, it may be hybrid driving, which both the engine and the electric motor of the hybrid drive at the output to provide a drive torque.\nFurthermore, it may be at such a mode of operation for purely electric-motor drive, in which the engine is stopped.\n\nIn another operating mode, it is the engine powered driving, wherein the electric motor is operated as a generator to charge the energy storage device.\n\nIn the newly invention is disclosing an inventive method for control and / or regulation of the operation of the drive train by the hybrid strategy is dependent on the electrical energy that can be generated by at least one thermoelectric generator from heat.\n\nWith the present invention it is proposed for the first time that, in a hybrid strategy of a power train having a hybrid drive, the electrical energy that can be produced by thermo-electric generators of heat, is taken into account for the regulation and / or control of the power train.\nThe present invention relates generally to an electrical power generating system that generates power through the use of the force of falling or flowing water. In particular, the present invention relates to a barge having an electrical power generating system that is powered by the movement of water, such as tidal water. \nNumerous devices have been developed to exploit the natural movement of water to produce electricity. However, such systems are costly to manufacture compared to the benefit that they provide. Moreover, conventional systems are typically mounted to a sea bed, i.e., conventional systems are fully submersed underwater. As such, maintenance and repair of such systems is difficult and costly as such actions require that the system be removed from the sea bed or employ the use of divers for repair, maintenance and installation. Moreover, because of the very nature of moving water bodies, e.g., tidal water movement, divers are exposed to hazardous conditions when required for repair, maintenance and installation. \n\nAccordingly, a need still exists for an electrical power generating system that can effectively utilize the natural movement of water bodies to generate electricity that is cost effective and which does not need to be mounted to a sea bed. The foregoing is accomplished by the present invention. In accordance with the present invention, the problem of cost prohibitive and/or sea bed mounted hydropower generating systems is solved by engendering a hydropower generating system that is mounted to a barge and which can receive the flow of, e.g., tidal water, regardless of a current direction of the tidal water. In this way, the power generating system can be easily installed, maintained, and transported while more efficiently harnessing the potential energy stored in moving water bodies. \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a tidal power generating system that includes a barge, a hollow body, a counter-rotating dual propeller rotor assembly, and an electric generator. The barge has a hull for supporting the barge above the surface of a body of tidal water. The hollow body extends from the hull so as to be submerged in the body of tidal water. The hollow body includes a first open end, a second open end disposed opposite and in fluid communication with the first open end such that tidal water passes between the first and second open ends regardless of a direction of current of the tidal water, and a throat region positioned between the first and second open ends. The counter-rotating dual propeller rotor assembly extends from the hull of the barge and is positioned within the throat region.\n\nRead and see more at:\nhttp://tonchev.net \nhttp://starton.biz \nhttp://b2b.bg \nhttp://tonchev.org \nhttp://greenclips.eu", "title": "How waste heat of an internal combustion engine is charging battery of a hybrid car ?", "publishedDate": "2013-01-30T10:58:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TBDBE1dXkU", "description": "Ever gotten a parking ticket on the MSU campus?

I hope that my work does NOT mould or constrain nature, but rather augments it.\n\nThe philosophy of Cosmicism, developed by the American writer H. P. Lovecraft, states that there is no recognizable divine presence, such as God, in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence. Perhaps we are just a small species projecting our own mental idolatries onto the vast cosmos, ever susceptible to being wiped from existence at any moment. This also suggests that in the context of a much greater struggle between large-scale universal forces, the majority of undiscerning humans are creatures with the no more significance than insects. \n\nSEE HERE:\nhttp://kaltek.wordpress.com/\nhttp://kaltek.org/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/namlak\n\nClosing event:  Saturday, 6-9 PM, Aug.28, 2010\n\nJack Hanley Gallery I 136 Watts Street, New York, NY 10013 I Tues--Sat 11-6pm mail@jackhanley.com jackhanley.com 646 918 6824", "title": "Tree B-Q.mov", "publishedDate": "2010-07-12T07:53:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TEp4D1uAa8", "description": "This is a spectacular crash of the #69 Overkill Sprint Boat, with driver Dennis Hughes and Navigator Matia Haskey, captured at Webb's Slough, Saint John Washington...on 6-16-2012.", "title": "Dennis Hughes Sprint Boat Crash at Webb's Slough 6-17-2012", "publishedDate": "2012-06-17T22:26:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TEySDLTYSo", "description": "", "title": "Lycopene tomatoes Steve Loewen", "publishedDate": "2009-07-21T21:01:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TEzxzR-gMo", "description": "The single cell ciliate Lacrymaria olor hunting and devouring Tetrahymena thermophila", "title": "Lacrymaria hunts Tetrahymena", "publishedDate": "2009-11-30T05:44:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TF4uvtJQiw", "description": "Your Face Sounds Familiar 2 - 11.05.2014. \u039f\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd.", "title": "Your Face Sounds Familiar 2 - \u039f\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd..11/5/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-11T22:16:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TFKDLvi2TI", "description": "Almost 70 miles (113 km) west of Key West lies the remote Dry Tortugas National Park.

Hirsch\n\nSynopsis: Returning home to a broken marriage and an uncertain future, combat veteran Anthony Hayward (Papazian) believes there is no hope for himself. Yet when a troubled ten year-old neighbor, Wade (Tristan Lake Leabu), calls out for help, Anthony cannot turn away. To the dismay of the boy's social worker (Laura San Giacomo), Anthony sets out on a fool's quest to help this heartbroken and hard-to-reach child find his long-lost father. In the midst of this new mission -- the first that seems to matter since his return -- Anthony begins to come to grips with both the costs of war and the universal power of human connection.\n\nRunning Time: 105 minutes (1hr. 45 min.)\n\nRating: R\n\nDistributor: Brainstorm Media\n\nWebsite: www.leastamongsaints.com", "title": "Least Among Saints (2012) - Official HD Movie Trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T03:16:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TNOY4-sBx0", "description": "A Preview of 'The Hasty Heart' at Hale Centre Theatre", "title": "The Hasty Heart", "publishedDate": "2011-04-23T00:11:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TNRg0uvzho", "description": "All playlists in this course below:\n\nUnit 1:\nTeaser: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEEFD8F8D67838E42\nLooking at data: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA577DB0DD013B20F\nScatterplots: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCAACA5CC58C5AFE8\nBar Charts: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96CAA28DA886AAE7\nPie Charts: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D14FBD37BEF0955\nProgramming: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC11DF34A676476D4\nAdmissions case study: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDD75DDE83CD248ED\n\nJoin the class at http://www.udacity.com to gain access to interactive quizzes, homework, programming assignments and a helpful community.", "title": "Most common age 2 - Intro to Statistics - Programming - Udacity", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T23:35:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1TO48Cnl66w", "description": "Dido Greatest Hits, out now! \nOrder now from iTunes http://smarturl.it/didohitsitdlx / CD http://smarturl.it/didohitsamzn\n\nFollow Dido online\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/dido \nTwitter - http://twitter.com/didoofficial \nOfficial site - http://www.didomusic.com/ \nTumblr - http://dido.tumblr.com/ \nInstagram - http://instagram.com/dido\n\nMusic video by Dido performing Thank You.

Originally these sheep were found in the mountainous regions of Anatolia and then were introduced to the Greek islands, eventually ending up in continental Europe. Today, wild Moulfon can mostly be found in Iraq and Iran. They're most distinguishable feature is their large impressive horns. \n\nABOUT PANCAKE ...\n\nPancake is a very special kitten that was abandoned at the tender age of three weeks in a hot parking lot in Phoenix. He was lucky to be found and rescued by some good people before succumbing to heat exhaustion. I fostered Pancake, bringing him to my home a week later. He instantly developed a close and loving bond with my two year old Doberman Pinscher, Sugar Tree. The two become fast friends and inseparable. Growing very attached to Pancake and not wanting to separate them, I adopted him and he became a permanent member of the family. It's wonderful having them; whether they're cuddling in bed or gently playing, it's hard not to smile with them around.\n\nThey're best known for their 2012 viral video Tiny Kitten Takes On Big Doberman:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmnODzMToyU\n\nHe is also the grand prize winner of The Friskies cat video awards 2013\n\nKeep up with Pancake and Sugar Tree on facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/camelsandfriends", "title": "Pancake the cat adopts his own baby lamb... pat pat", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T00:10:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1T_dnb0j1F8", "description": "We're trying to raise awareness about the situation of Gaza and trying to raise money for Gaza\nPlease donate on the link below for the people of Gaza, JazakaAllah khairun\n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gaza-chilli-challenge\n\nFollow me on Twitter and Instagram @Ajmain23\nwww.Facebook.com/oyonajmain", "title": "CHILLI CHALLENGE FOR GAZA!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T22:48:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "1T_sb-tPdx4", "description": "This video shows you how to cut a glass circle with a circle cutter.

Song and dance, painting, traditions, and making a living -- these are the themes of his research journey to the origins of Australian culture. The action scenes are Angatja in Northwest South Australia, near Uluru/Ayers Rock, and Utopia in Northern Territory. As an original contribution to intercultural dialogue, the song \"Uluru, Ulurunya\" by Ivy Nganyinytja, Mabel Tjulkiwa and Jeannie Kunmanara from Angatja bears witness to the interactive encounter with Robert Bachmann and his music. \"The Fractal Dreamtime\" shows rarely movieed ritual Aboriginal song and dance scenes, and the composer's meeting in Utopia with the Australian painter Dave Pwerle Ross who created the ULURU picture \"Two Star Men\". This unique documentation of intercultural encounter gently introduces viewers to the Aboriginal \"Dreamtime\" mystery.\n\nCollaborators:\n\nTHE LONDON PHILHARMONIC\nTHE LONDON VOICES\nROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA\nBUDAPEST PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA\nBUDAPEST SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\nBALASSAGYARMAT CITY CHORUS\nCHRISTINA ASCHER, mezzo-soprano\nJEANNE CHRISTEE, violin\nELENA DENISOVA, violin\nMARSHALL WHYLER, didgeridoo\nVIRGINIA VON FABER-CASTELL, voice\n\nAustralian Aboriginal singers:\nDAVID PWERLE ROSS, Utopia, N.T.

One common theme we hear from many markets is the desire for clean compounds,\" according to Gregg Newby, Global Director of Marketing and Business Development at RTP Company. \"In response, we have established an Ultra Clean Compounding Center to manufacture materials for applications with higher quality requirements. The new centre is a controlled production environment offering significant improvements that allows us to now supply superior quality clean compounds.\"\n\nCurrently operational with two extrusion lines, the 3,300 sq ft (305 m2) self-contained compounding centre has capacity for four lines and is capable of producing almost any product in RTP Company's portfolio. Extrusion and post-extrusion operations (cooling, pelletising, classifying, and packaging) are conducted inside a climate-controlled, positive pressure environment with interlocks to limit access.\n\nExtruders are fully automated with touch-screen controls that allow complete process monitoring and data acquisition. \"Compounds produced in our new facility are also ideal for applications that require extensive data recording and robust traceability of the manufacturing process,\" added Newby.\n\nStringent operating and finished product testing protocols are used to minimise any potential for cross contamination during manufacture. Good manufacturing practices are utilised in management and operation of the new centre. \"Tighter control over the environment and specifications during manufacture results in more consistent compounds and eliminates sources of contamination. We can ensure that materials produced in this facility will set new industry standards,\" explained Newby.\n\nInitial demand for clean materials has primarily been driven by the medical and electronics industries, but applications requiring improved cleanliness are quickly spreading to other industries where the cost of contamination in rejected parts is extremely high.", "title": "RTP Shares Video of its \"Ultra Clean Compounding Centre\" with Medical Plastics News", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T10:34:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1U1nxH1fjqE", "description": "My son Etienne and I co-taught 2nd grade Catechism.

Stucker was born on July 2, 1947 in Des Moines, Iowa. He attended Lincoln School in Alameda, California. During his school days Stephen was known as both an accomplished pianist and a class clown with a dry wit. Stucker made his film debut with a funny turn as crazed asylum escapee Bruce Wilson in the entertainingly lowbrow \"Carnal Madness.\" He was likewise sidesplitting as a cross-dressing court stenographer in \"The Kentucky Fried Movie.\" Stephen achieved his greatest enduring popularity with his gloriously zany and unforgettable performance as loopy airport control room worker Johnny in the hilarious disaster picture parody \"Airplane!.\" Stucker reprised this role in \"Airplane II: The Sequel\" and had an amusing bit as a train stationmaster in \"Trading Places.\" Stephen appeared in three episodes of the hit TV series \"Mork & Mindy.\" Besides \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\" and \"Airplane!,\" Stucker also worked with the comedy team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker as a member of the theatrical group the Kentucky Fried Theater. Stephen Stucker died at the tragically young age of 38 from AIDS on April 13, 1986.\n\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Stucker\n\nVideo is under Fair Use:\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act in 1976; Allowance is made for \"Fair Use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\nFair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.

Yue Fei was remembered for his military successes, loyalty towards his country, and filial piety for his elderly mother. \n\nYue Fei was born in 1103\u2014towards the end of the Northern Song Dynasty from parents who were humble farmers in what is today's Henan province. \n\nAs Yue Fei was growing up, China was constantly attacked from the north by the fierce Jurchen army. During this time, the Southern Song Imperial court urgently tried to enlist soldiers to defend the country.\n\nYoung Yue Fei was torn between going to fight for his country and staying home to care for his elderly mother. \n\nOne story has it that Yue Fei's mother encouraged her son to embrace the honor of defending his country. She asked him to take off his shirt and then tattooed four Chinese characters on his back: \"Jing zhong bao guo.\" It means to \"serve the country with loyalty.\"\n\nAfter the Jurchens invaded the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng and captured the emperor in 1127, the emperor's younger brother escaped to establish the Southern Song Dynasty. \n\nGeneral Yue Fei became a symbol of hope during these difficult times. It was believed that once he led only 500 men and defeated the 100,000-Jurchen Army\u2014forcing the enemy to retreat. \n\nYue Fei was not only known for his courage and bravery. He was a man with lofty moral principles. He cared for his soldiers and personally attended to them when they were ill. He helped their families, when they died in combat. But he was also strict with them and forbade them from plundering civilians in the towns they passed through. \n\nYue Fei was also remembered for his benevolence towards ordinary citizens. After suppressing a revolt soon after the founding of the Southern Song Dynasty, Yue Fei pleaded with Emperor Gaozong to spare the lives of the ordinary people in the town. He eventually convinced the emperor to only execute those who had started the revolt. \n\nThe story has it that Emperor Gaozong presented Yue Fei with a banner to honor his loyalty to the throne and to the welfare of the people. \n\nBut Yue Fei's military achievements made some corrupt palace officials jealous of him. They poisoned Emperor Gaozong against him. Yue Fei was thus recalled to the palace and stripped of his military duties. \n\nA year later, in 1142 AD Minister Qin Hui sentenced Yue Fei to death on false charges. Yue Fei was only 39 years old at the time of his death. The public mourned the death of their hero and despised Qin Hui.\n\nAccording to historical texts, 21 years after his death, Emperor Xiaozong acquitted Yue Fei and reinstated him as the loyal general. For their role in Yue Fei's death, iron statues of Qin Hui, his wife, and two other palace officials were made to kneel in front of Yue Fei's tomb.\n\nMargaret Trey, PhD.", "title": "General Yue Fei\u2014Epitome of Loyalty and Filial Piety", "publishedDate": "2012-12-07T22:45:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1U8I3SHofQo", "description": "RECORDED IN RUSHDEM MUZIK STUDIOS N.Y.\nRUSHDEM CONTACT ; DUNDYPLACE2@YAHOO.COM OR RUSHDEMMUZIK@YAHOO.COM jamaica LIKE , SHARE , COMMENT .... check out dundyplace Gallis VYBZ KARTEL, WORLD BOSS, MERITAL FAMILY, POPCAAN, BEENIE MAN, DOTTA COPPA, SHAWN STORM, DOZA MEDICINE, GAZA SLIM, GAZA INDU, SHEBA, KASEXODUS, TOMMY LEE AKA MOBAY \"GAZA SPARTA\", MAXWELL, BOOKIE, CP INC, BLASS, SCHOOL BOY, GAZA DANGER, MILLA 9, NOTNICE, BADDA DAN, LEE MILLA, SINGER BLINGER, LISA HYPE, 21 BAD GYAL, BLAK RYNO, GAZAEMPIRE CHRISTOPHER MARTIN JAH VINCI J.O.P, AIDONIA, DING DONG, BUSY SIGNAL, ALLIANCE, BOUNTY KILLER, MAVADO, GULLY, BUSTA RHYMES, WIZ KHALIFA, YMCMB, NICKI MINAJ, LIL WAYNE, BIRD MAN, YOUNG MONEY, DJ KHALED, ACE HOOD, DRAKE, YOUNG JEZZY, RICK ROSS, USHER goat head masicka BUSTA .

But instead, I saw in the press a report that he has mentioned some of the inmates became victims in the Changi Prison.\n\n\"I'm very surprised to hear all this. How is it that when I met him, he had not mentioned this, and a few years later he raised the same issue again?\"\n\nIn his letter, Singapore's Consul-General in Hong Kong Jacky Foo added that Phoenix TV should not have publicised and perpetuated falsehoods without establishing the facts with the relevant authority.\n\nIn response to media queries, the Singapore Prison Service also said that the regime of incarceration is strict, with a strong emphasis on discipline, and fair and equal treatment for all inmates.\n\nIt added: \"Mr Chen Jiulin's allegations are without basis and he did not raise any such concerns during his period of imprisonment.

E\u00e9n dader met pistool, de ander met een groot mes. Op het moment van de overval zijn er behalve twee medewerksters, ook klanten in de winkel.\n Als de overvallers binnen komen, zet de eerste een pistool op het hoofd van de medewerkster, en dwingt haar mee te lopen naar het kantoor. De tweede dader houdt de klanten onder controle door middel van bedreiging met een flink mes. In het kantoor moet de medewerkster een geldkist openen, waarop de daders er met geld vandoor gaan.\n Er zijn bewakingsbeelden en andere aanwijzingen, waarmee de politie de hulp van het publiek inroept om deze overvallers te vinden.\n\n De daders:\n De overvaller met het pistool is:\n - blank\n - een jaar of twintig\n - en heeft een slank postuur\n Verder sprak hij met een buitenlands accent.\n\n Degene met het mes is ook een jaar of twintig en droeg een lichtblauwe broek met daaronder zwarte gympen.\n\n De buit\n Deze nog jonge daders hebben na de overval de beschikking over een aanzienlijk geldbedrag. Het kan in hun omgeving opgevallen zijn, dat zij plotseling dure of opvallende aankopen hebben gedaan. Dat wil de politie graag weten.\n\n Handschoen\n In de Caspar Damstraat, niet ver van de plaats van de overval, werd een herenhandschoen (zie foto)  gevonden, die mogelijk door de daders is verloren. Wie weet, van wie die handschoen is?\n\nStuivezand\n Diezelfde avond om ongeveer 21.00 uur werden bij discotheek/caf\u00e9 Stuivezand, net buiten Zundert,  twee jonge jongens gezien. Op een zwarte omafiets kwamen ze daar aan. En ze vielen op, gedroegen zich vreemd, waren opgefokt. We sluiten niet uit dat ze iets met de overval te maken hebben.\n\n Groene Golf\n Als ze weer verder gefietst zijn richting Rijsbergen , komt vlak daarna een groene VW Golf langs, die scheurt over dit parkeerterrein ook richting Rijsbergen.  Getuigen zeggen, dat die Golf een opvallende , ietwat lichte kleur groen had. Misschien kwam die auto daar naartoe om de jongens op te halen?

Turkey alone is playing host to 500,000 of our brothers and sisters, 200,000 of whom are still living in tents.\n\nMany of these are children. They are trying to survive under conditions of hunger, want and poverty.\n\nThe communist Ba'athist regime in Syria is ruthlessly trying to annihilate its own innocent civilian citizens. \n\nThe Ba'athist regime has previously been suspected of using chemical weapons on many occasions but now it has openly used them in Guta.\nWomen\nChildren \nThe elderly\nAnd scores of innocent civilians were poisoned to death. \nThese people had no weapons in their hands, were not violent and had committed no crime. \n\nInternational meetings aimed at stopping this aggression on the part of the Syrian regime are still taking place. But merely issuing \"condemnations\" and acting with bureaucratic ponderousness lacerates the conscience. Yet all the sufferings can be eased at once: The only solution to the suffering is Islamic Union. \n\nIslamic Union is the solution that will lead to the peace and security desired by all, not just in Syria, Kirkuk, Egypt, East Turkestan and Palestine, but for the whole world.\nIf the Islamic world unites,\nIt will no longer have to watch mass deaths, injustice and oppression,\nIt will no longer suffer a succession of disasters in a state of helplessness,\nIt will not have to place its hopes in the West to resolve problems when they arise,\nIt will not have to worry about what pains will be suffered tomorrow,\nAnd will no longer have to struggle against poverty, want and backwardness.\n\nIf the Islamic world is united, if it is fully devoted to the moral values of the Qur'an, if it embraces all people with love and affection, no matter what their opinions, and treats them all as first-class citizens and if it stands up for science, art and beauty, then a brand new civilization can be built. \n\nThe time has now come for the Islamic world, with 100 years of pain and suffering behind it, to unite. God shows us how urgent this is in every event that takes place. \n\nDo not forget, unity is not a political requirement for Muslims, it is God's command and promise. For that reason, every Muslim has a responsibility to strive for Islamic Union, without saying, \"How can that be done? Will it be allowed?\" If we all honestly say, \"O Lord, bestow Islamic Union upon us,\" then, by the will of God, we will together see this promise come true. \n\nO Lord, give us Islamic Union without delay!\n\nhttp://en.a9.com.tr/\nhttp://www.harunyahya.com/\nhttp://www.endoftimes.net/\nhttp://www.awaitedmahdi.com/\nhttp://www.jesuswillreturn.com/\nhttp://www.turkishislamicunion.com/", "title": "The only solution to the suffering in Syria is Islamic Union.!", "publishedDate": "2013-10-26T10:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1UNp-Qwpu48", "description": "Laparoscopic Pyloromyotomy is usually performed for Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster.

Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year; longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than 7 leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Flytrap\n\nThe only two active snap traps\u2014the Venus flytrap  - Dionaea muscipula -  and the waterwheel plant  - Aldrovanda vesiculosa \u2014 are believed to have had a common ancestor with similar adaptations. Their trapping mechanism has also been described as a \"mouse trap\" based on their shape or rapid movement.  \n\nThe fly rub its legs over the top of a trigger hair. The trap shuts airtight. Then it fills with liquids containing enzymes which break down organic matter into simpler chemical compounds. These compouds are then used by the plant for growth.\n\nThe trap constricts tightly around the insect and secretes digestive juices, much like those in your stomach. It dissolves the soft, inner parts of the insect, but not the tough, outer part called the exoskeleton. At the end of the digestive process, which takes from five to twelve days, the trap reabsorbs the digestive fluid and then reopens. The leftover parts of the insect, the exoskeleton, blow away in the wind or are washed away by rain. http://www.botany.org/bsa/misc/carn.html\n\nD\u00fdr\u00e6tur \u00ed jurtar\u00edkinu\nEftir: Ingimar \u00d3skarsson \u00ed N\u00e1tt\u00farufr\u00e6\u00f0ingnum 1970 : \n\n\u00c1ri\u00f0 1769 f\u00e9kk hinn heimsfr\u00e6gi, s\u00e6nski n\u00e1tt\u00farufr\u00e6\u00f0ingur Carl von Linn\u00e9 sendibr\u00e9f fr\u00e1 enskum kaupmanni; s\u00e1 h\u00e9t John Ellis. \u00cd br\u00e9fi \u00feessu segir svo, me\u00f0al annars: ,,\u00c9g sendi y\u00f0ur h\u00e9r me\u00f0 n\u00e1kv\u00e6ma teikningu \u00e1samt bl\u00f6\u00f0um og bl\u00f3mi af einhverri jurt, sem vir\u00f0ist hafa annars konar matar\u00e6\u00f0i en almennt gerist me\u00f0al jurta.

The nursery web spider hunts amongst low vegetation as well as on the ground. When detecting prey, they characteristically rest on vegetation with the first two pairs of legs together, held out at an angle.\n\nDuring courtship, the male nursery-web spider presents the female with a 'nuptial gift' in the form of an insect wrapped in silk.  Until fairly recently, this gift was thought to protect the male from becoming the female's next meal. Research has shown, however, that the gift entices the female to mate, and what's more, the size of the gift is related to how long the female will mate with a male. The larger the gift, the longer copulation will last and so more eggs will be fertilized by more 'generous' males bringing larger gifts.\n\nFemale spiders belonging to this family produce very large egg sacs, which they carry around beneath their body.  When the time for the spiderlings to emerge approaches, the female deposits the egg sac on a leaf and spins a protective silk 'nursery web' around it. She then opens the egg sac slightly, and stands guard until the spiderlings emerge.", "title": "Nursery Web Spider + Eastern Tent Caterpillar (Malacosoma americanum)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25T05:09:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1U_f8peE8to", "description": "Murai Batu Nembak Love Bird From Melawi (GARUDA)", "title": "Murai Batu Nembak Love Bird From Melawi (GARUDA)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T06:22:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1U_vJjHRufE", "description": "What I believe to be Asclepias incarnata, Swamp Milkweed, growing out in a wetland field.

Forecasters predicted a dangerous storm surge with large waves as well as drenching rains capable of causing landslides and flash floods.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said satellite imagery indicates Odile's center made landfall at about 9:45 p.m. PDT near Cabo San Lucas. It said at landfall, Odile had estimated intensity of 125 mph, and an automated station near Cabo San Lucas reported a sustained wind of 89 mph with a gust to 116 mph. The storm was moving north-northwest at 17 mph.\n\nAs howling winds whipped palm trees amid pelting rain outside, people bedded down and used magazines to fan themselves in crowded, stuffy safe rooms. Some did crossword puzzles or listened to iPhones. In one hotel near San Jose del Cabo, power went out not long after nightfall and a generator was keeping minimal lights on.\n\nDenise Mellor, a traveler from Orange County, California, was frustrated about a lack of information about the storm and said she was learning more from her daughter back home than from hotel workers.\n\n\"It's a little bit (unsettling) that we don't have a choice but to sit in here and hope for the best,\" Mellor said. \"So that makes me a little bit scared.\"\n\nMexican authorities evacuated coastal areas and readied shelters for up to 30,000 people.\n\n\"We are going to be hit, do not risk your life,\" warned Marcos Covarrubias, governor of Baja California Sur.\n\nAfter reaching Category 4 strength on Sunday, Odile weakened some to Category 3 but was still a major storm. The U.S. hurricane center warned of possible coastal flooding and rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated amounts up to 15 inches.\n\nOn Sunday, police with megaphones walked through vulnerable areas in Cabo San Lucas urging people to evacuate.\n\n\"I'm leaving. It's very dangerous here,\" said Felipa Flores, clutching a plastic bag with a few belongings as she took her two small children from her neighborhood of El Caribe to a storm shelter. \"Later on we're going to be cut off and my house of wood and laminated cardboard won't stand up to much.\"\n\nAt least 22 airline flights were canceled. Some tourists camped out at the Los Cabos international airport hoping to get out before the storm, but the facility shut down all air operations late in the afternoon.\n\nLuis Felipe Puente, national coordinator for Mexico's civil protection agency, said 164 shelters had been prepared for as many as 30,000 people in Baja California Sur.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect from Punta Abreojos to Loreto. Mexican authorities declared a maximum alert for areas in or near Odile's path, and ports in Baja California were ordered closed.\n\nIn the central Atlantic, Hurricane Edouard had sustained winds near 85 mph, although it was forecast to remain far out at sea and pose no threat to land.\n\nThe U.S. hurricane center said Edouard's center was 835 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and was moving northwest at 15 mph.", "title": "RAW: Hurricane Odile Damages After landfall & Hits Baja California - Cabo San Lucas Mexico Storms!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T20:13:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Ua47z9ZK58", "description": "Cover --- for more info http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Baronets/385717338824", "title": "The Baronets Band - Rakrakan Concert Tour (Inayawan)", "publishedDate": "2009-12-18T15:18:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1UaCvKG3VqA", "description": "Hi everyone, Hyunwoo here.

Get sable brushes of various shapes and sizes.\n\nTip\nKeep in mind that paints with cadmium will dry in days rather than hours.\n\nStep 2: Pretreat with gesso\nPretreat an already stretched canvas with gesso. To further fill pores and smooth the surface, use fine sandpaper, and cover a second time. Once the gesso dries, sketch your scene.\n\nStep 3: Squeeze paint on palette\nSet the canvas on the easel. Squeeze out the \"fat\" or thick paint from the bottom of the tube onto the palette.\n\nStep 4: Mix linseed and mineral spirits\nMix linseed oil into the darker colors to be used on the under-painting, since it dries better. Use the palette knife to work in mineral spirits to make the paint lean and elastic.\n\nTip\nEssential oils like turpentine evaporate well and are good thinners. Resins and balsams add clarity and gloss.\n\nStep 5: Brush lightly\nUse a light hand when applying the paint, and a wider stroke when applying more medium. \n\nStep 6: Correct mistakes\nCorrect mistakes, wiping away the paint with the palette knife and use a turpentine-dipped, lint-free cloth to finish removing. When you repaint, sand that surface first and moisten it with a touch of mineral oil. \n\nStep 7: Clean brushes as you paint\nDip the brush in a cup filled with a small amount of turpentine to clean as you paint. Dry the painting in light whenever possible, as daylight cures the colors better.\n\nTip\nPainting thinner layers over a thick drying layer will distort the surface of the painting.\n\nStep 8: Finish session\nWipe your knife and handles with rags when you're finished. Stir the brushes in solvent, but don't soak them overnight. Scoop leftover globs of paint from the palette so that the surface is smooth for the next round.\n\nDid You Know?\nDid you know?

After wading through all the advertising and page after page of fine print, side-by-side comparisons can be hard.  That lack of clarity makes it all too easy to end up with a deal that doesn't work for you and your family.\n\nThis has real-life consequences\u2014for you and for the whole economy.  \n\nFor years, the financial system has been loaded with more and more dangerous loans, including millions of risky and unaffordable mortgages. Many government agencies supervised different parts of the system, making it nearly impossible for people to hold any one agency accountable.  This fractured and outdated system was slow to adjust to the built up of risk in our economy, and we all know what happened then.... \n\nIt was time for a change.  In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and President Obama signed it into law.  Instead of important consumer protection powers being scattered across the federal government, they would all be under one roof. Now a single entity has the oversight authority to make sure that consumer financial markets work for all of us\u2014not just for the big guys.  It's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB.  \n\nIts job is to make credit products and other consumer financial services safer and easier to understand -- by making sure that prices are clear up front and risks are easy to see. \n\nThink about it like this: When you go to the store to buy a toaster, you have several models to choose from.  But you know that whatever model you buy, the thing isn't going to burn your house down.  No manufacturer gets to boost its profits by putting in cheap wiring that you can't see.  If someone wants to compete for your business, they need to lower the price or add new features.\n\nThe new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will work to cut down on the fine print, which means there won't be places to hide nasty surprises.  It will also work to make the prices and risks clear for mortgages, credit cards, and other kinds of financial products and services.  That way, families can do some comparison shopping and choose the products that are best for them.\n\nThe CFPB will be a cop on the beat, making sure that every lender follows the same rules.  When banks or other financial companies break the law, they will be held accountable.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Bureau is brand new.  Right now, it's putting in place the basic tools so it can tackle all of these responsibilities.  Stay in touch as the CFPB works to fix the broken consumer credit market and to help prevent future economic crises.", "title": "Welcome to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) - featuring narration by Ron Howard", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T22:32:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V0Mv2vPxnA", "description": "Eski\u015fehir", "title": "Class Celtis 456 Silajl\u0131k M\u0131s\u0131r Yeri S\u00fcr\u00fcm\u00fc", "publishedDate": "2013-12-27T13:12:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V0SURwheSo", "description": "Pe\u00e7a publicit\u00e1ria desenvolvida por Lucas Fran\u00e7a.\n\nCliente: Yuza\nVeicula\u00e7\u00e3o: Janela Indoor", "title": "YUZA   FIM DE ANO", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T13:26:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V0_2mjs6oM", "description": "stop motion !", "title": "smilo and smila", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T11:31:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V0i3rfk2zk", "description": "D\u00e9monstration du challenge \"LFI\" sur Hackbbs.org\nT\u00e9l\u00e9chargement : http://www.sendspace.com/file/wqmaoz", "title": "[HACK BBS] Faille LFI", "publishedDate": "2012-03-12T18:20:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V0p_1B_fVc", "description": "Stefan Weise - Dualism  // Evoked Recordings [EVO008R]\nGenre: Techno,\nRelease Date: Nov 04 2014\nBeatport: http://www.beatport.com/search?query=Evoked%20Recordings\nLabel: Evoked Recordings\n\n1 Stefan Weise - Dualism (Periscope 2014 Remix)\n\nRelease Info: \n\nStefan Weise returns for remix duties on  Dualism , this time under his Periscope guise.

RT's Egor Piskunov has been examining what is driving this dangerous trend.\nWith a population of only 6,000, Zossen is a typical small German town, remote from large industries and financial centers. Life here is calm and peaceful -- or at least it used to be, before 2009.\nIt all started with Nazi symbols appearing around the town. Then a local social center was torched. A young man who openly identifies himself as a neo-Nazi, and who admitted encouraging a teenager to set the center on fire, is now being prosecuted and faces up to two years behind bars.\nJ\u00f6rg Wanke, who has spearheaded a campaign against neo-Nazis in his home town, has seen his own office vandalized.  He says the final straw came when neo-Nazis marched through Zossen's main square.\n\n\"I used to be afraid, but it helps not to act alone, to have supporters. I became a public person with our initiative and it's sort of my protection,\" says Wanke. \nAnother activist, Peter Schmidt, says the town is divided on how to respond to the neo-Nazi threat.  \"Some say we're exaggerating and are only making things worse by attracting too much attention. But I think they are simply afraid,\" he says.\nActivists say it is easy for the neo-Nazis to recruit new members, especially among disillusioned and dejected teenagers. With poor infrastructure and high unemployment, and few social escapes on offer in the town, it is often simply boredom which drives them to extremes.\nUnfortunately, the problem with neo-Nazism in Germany exists on a much wider scale. Thousands of neo-Nazis gather for annual marches in Dresden, often clashing with police and anti-fascist activists. \nAnd in November, German police caught two suspects believed to be members of a neo-Nazi terror cell involved in killing at least 10 foreigners.   \nWhile the scale of the problem is daunting, analysts believe the causes are more or less banal. They say it is money struggles rather than just boredom which are igniting the trouble.\n\n\"Economic unrest causes unrest in families, conflicts in families, and if they're not solved we have a kind of rage. But now the rage was escalated by racist agitation and even neo-Nazi groupings,\" explains Hajo Funke, an extremism expert and professor at Berlin's Free University.\nGermany's focus may currently be fixed on spending billions to pull the eurozone out of its crisis, but it ignores economic trouble at home at its peril. If left unchecked, it may not be too long before a disenfranchised youth drags Germany towards some of the biggest mistakes of its past.", "title": "The rise of neo-Nazism across Europe", "publishedDate": "2012-01-03T08:01:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1V4AscLidWg", "description": "Music video by HIM performing Join Me In Death.

This complete coverage of the soil by the Etera SEDUM TILES does much to discourage germination of airborne weed seeds, and reduces evaporation of soil moisture through exposed soil. There is also the important advantage of not having to wait for the green roof to \"grow in\" before it looks good. Etera green roof sedums are also self-replicating on the roof, and will colonize and fill any blank areas that might appear.Selected perennials have been inserted into the sedums, and provide additional interest. In this case, Achillea millefolium 'Paprika' has taken a prominant posistion in the mix, and is blooming heavily.

Very very typical common sort of bristle gasketing. Most commonly seen as a door sweep or an astragal as well. You know using it as perimeter gasketing, sure, of course you certainly could. I see it as a sweep or as an astragal more often. Available in the clear anodized aluminum finish as seen here along with a dark bronze. The clear is gonna feature a gray bristle; the dark bronze would feature a black bristle, of course. There is an image below this video showing everything important dimensionally about the item, and let's go over that now. You can see that the height of the extrusion is 3/4\" and then you've got 9/16\" projection of bristle, that all makes sense. So 3/4\", 9/16\", what 1-5/16\" overall height, yep, looks like that's what it is. A projection of this item is gonna be probably about 1/4\", yeah a little heavy, maybe 5/16\". Is going to include screws in a complimentary finish. They look to be about a 6 x 1\", something in that range. This is a nice quality item. The bristle feels very dense, very durable, because it's shorter it's going to feel a little stiffer than otherwise, but certainly something that you're going to see very commonly installed on aluminum store front doors, down at the bottom as door sweeps. You'll see it installed on steel doors as astragals, very commonly. If you have need for a custom length, by all means let us know by ordering the next longest piece or pieces and indicating in the comment field what length you'd like for us to cut the material back to. The reasoning is if you had to take this 3' piece and cut it back down to say 34\" or 32\", you'd eliminate that slotted hole and that slotted hole is nice to have there because it allows you to compensate laterally for a condition of a sill, or a door not being level or plumb. Also it helps compensate for when you're drilling the drill bit in the steel, wood, aluminum, or fiberglass, and the drill bit has the tendency to walk a little bit if you've not used a center punch. So that slotted hole will help allow for that small amount of adjustment. So if you order a custom length we'll not only locate the slotted hole at the proper distance from the edge but the proper center to center as well, reducing the amount of work that you'd have to do overall. National Guard is a full line manufacturer of all things weather stripping related, not only the extremely common things like a bristle door sweep or gasketing or astragal, but your thresholds, material made of aluminum base like this, stainless steel base material, architectural bronze base material, they also have a full line of steel vision frames used in wood and metal doors, and is a very very nice knowledgeable, professional company to be a distributor for.

Stood their ground and died.\nThat I could be alive and see the damage,\nthat we've managed since.\nIn this sceptred isle. Is nothing sacred.\nJust a one square mile.\n\nJustice and Liberty. You can buy what you don't get free.\nIn a world of steel and glass. We bury our past.\n\nOn and On. We slept till dawn. When we awoke, we hardly spoke.\n\nMy grandfather taught me how to fight.\nOld fashioned stuff like wrong and right.\nBut all around I see his morals buried in a mess\nOf money troubles, Born in a mining town in '58.\nWhen black and white TV was up to date.\nAnd men where still around.\nWho fought for freedom, stood their ground and died.\n\nJustice and Liberty. You can buy what you don't get free.\nIn a world of steel and glass. We bury our past.\n\nOn and On. We slept till dawn.\nWhen we awoke, it was, all the same.\n\n..................\n''Born in '58\" is the last single from Bruce Dickinson's debut solo album, Tattooed Millionaire. It was released in October, 1990. The song talks about Bruce Dickinson's own life and is particularly dedicated to his grandfather.''\n\nDive Dive Live video can be found on ''Anthology'' DVD (Disc 1) by Bruce Dickinson, released on June 19, 2006.\n\n''Anthology'' is a 3 disc compilation DVD by Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer of Iron Maiden. The DVD features three live performances as well every single promotional video made during Bruce's solo career. The DVD also includes over an hour of extras and unreleased footage. \n\nDisc 1 features two live performances, the first is from the Tattooed Millionaire tour entitled Dive Dive Live, Bruce's first tour as a solo artist,and the second live performance is from the Skunkworks tour 1996 - Recorded in Pamplona and Gerona, Spain on May 30th and 31st 1996.\n\nDive Dive Live was filmed at the Town & Country Club in LA, August 14,at the end of the \"Tattooed millionaire\" US club tour in 1990. The video was directed by Jim Yukich (known for his work with Iron Maidens \"Live After Death\") and the personel were the same as on \"Tattooed Millionaire\", except that Dickie Fliszar handled the drum duties.\n\nThe material consists of practically all material from the Tattooed Millionaire-sessions (except Darkness Be My Friend from the All The Young Dudes single) including Bring Your Daughter...). The set also included some cover songs the band did on the tour, Deep Purple's \"Black Night\", AC/DC's \"Sin City\". They had previously done Free's \"Wishing Well\" on the European leg of the tour and in the US this one was replaced by Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter.\n\n'' 'Tattooed Millionaire' is a hard rock album released in 1990 by Bruce Dickinson. It is his first solo album. The album project began when Dickinson was asked to record a song for the fifth Nightmare on Elm Street movie, which became the song called \"Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter\". Collaborating with future Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, Dickinson began to make a solo album which was fundamentally different from his works with Iron Maiden, sounding much more rock-oriented. \"Bring your Daughter...\" was not included on the original album but Iron Maiden later recorded a different version that was included on their 1990 album No Prayer for the Dying, which coincidentally became the band's only number one single to date. The introduction to the song \"No Lies\" is also reminiscent of Iron Maiden's version of \"Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter\". All songs written and composed by Bruce Dickinson and Janick Gers, except where noted. ''\n\nThe album was recorded in Battery studios in London and was produced by Chris Tsangrides. It featured the Mott the Hoople cover All the young dudes (also released as single) which Bruce changed the words for. In the line \"My brother's back at home with the Beatles and the Stones\" he exchanged the word \"brother\" to \"father\", since he thought it was such a long time the original words were written that it fitted better to have his father back at home with the Beatles and the Stones.\nThe album was a way for Bruce to ventilate his workoholism but he did nothing that he thought would scare people off as it was made \"under the watchful eye of the collective\", i.e. Iron Maiden.

Since 1999, postgraduate education is available, but the new Bauhaus is more then just a museum or school; the institution is THE place to be for education, research and design of the present day urban development.\nWalter Gropius really became famous with the transparent glass architecture of the Bauhaus building. He had thought up a three dimensional form that was way ahead of its time. The building did not in any way have a claim to eternal fame, but strangely it seems to have done just that. \nGropius designed the building as a well functioning cover that would bring the outside world in, and let the inside world out. His Bauhaus educational theory was 'art and technology, a new unity'.\n\n\"Laat ons samen het nieuwe gebouw van de toekomst scheppen\" sprak architect Walter Gropius, die van 1919 tot 1928 directeur van het beroemde Bauhaus in Weimar en Dessau was.\n\nLooking for broadcast footage?

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 22 October 1724. The cantata text is based on the chorale \"Schm\u00fccke dich, o liebe Seele\" by Johann Franck.\n\nBach wrote the cantata in his second year in Leipzig as part of his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 22 October 1724. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Ephesians, \"walk circumspectly, ... filled with the Spirit\" (Ephesians 5:15--21), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the great banquet (Matthew 22:1--14). The German term used in Luther's Bible translation is Hochzeitsmahl, literally \"wedding meal\". The cantata text is based on the Eucharistic chorale in nine stanzas Schm\u00fccke dich, o liebe Seele, BWV 180 (1649) by Johann Franck,[3] thus connecting the \"great banquet\" from the gospel to the Abendmahl (Eucharist). The hymn is sung during a service in preparation for the holy communion, and imagines a bride getting ready for her wedding. An unknown author kept the text of the first, central and last stanza (1, 4, 9), and paraphrased the other stanzas to arias and recitatives, stanzas 2 and 7 to arias, stanzas 3, 5--6 and 8 to recitatives. He stayed close to the original and did not seek closer relation to the readings than given by the general context.\n\nCompared to the early cantata for the same occasion, Ach! ich sehe, itzt, da ich zur Hochzeit gehe, BWV 162, Bach stresses the invitation of God and the joy of the banquet, rather than the possibility of man's failing to respond to the invitation. Alfred D\u00fcrr compares the opening chorus and both arias to dances, movement 1 to a gigue, movement 2 to a bourr\u00e9e, movement 5 to a polonaise. The opening chorus is an orchestral concerto with the vocal parts embedded, the soprano singing the cantus firmus of the tune by Johann Cr\u00fcger. John Eliot Gardiner sees the \"relaxed 12/8 processional movement\" as \"perfectly tailored to the idea of the soul dressing itself up in all its wedding finery\".\n\nThe following three movements are distinguished by their obbligato instruments. A flute accompanies the tenor voice in movement 2, \"Ermuntre dich: dein Heiland klopft\" (Be lively now, your Savior knocks). The knocking is expressed in repeated notes. The demanding flute part was probably composed for the excellent flute player for whom Bach first wrote a few weeks earlier in Was frag ich nach der Welt, BWV 94, and then in other cantatas during the fall of 1724. A violoncello piccolo complements the soprano in movement 3, which begins as a secco recitative \"Wie teuer sind des heilgen Mahles Gaben\" (How dear are the gifts of the holy meal) and leads to the fourth stanza of the chorale, \"Ach, wie hungert mein Gem\u00fcte\" (Ah, how my spirit hungers), sung in a moderately adorned version of the tune. In movement 4, two recorders reflect the text of the alto recitative which develops to an arioso, with the recorders first playing just long chords, then gradually adding movement. The full orchestra supports the soprano in the second aria \"Lebens Sonne, Licht der Sinnen\" (Sun of life, light of the senses). The last recitative, \"Mein Herz f\u00fchlt in sich Furcht und Freude\" (My heart feels its own fear and joy) is secco, but closes as an arioso on the words \"und deiner Liebe stets gedenken\" (and considers your love constantly). The closing chorale, \"Jesu, wahres Brot des Lebens\" (Jesus, true bread of life), is set for four parts.\n\nAlthough originally scored for four soloists, soprano, alto, tenor and bass, four-part choir, and an orchestra of two recorders, flauto traverso, two oboes, oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, violoncello piccolo and basso continuo, I created this arrangement for Solo Concert (Pedal) Harp.", "title": "Recitative: \"Wie teuer sind des heilgen Mahles Gaben\" (BWV 180 No 3) for Harp", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T13:33:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1VeX-gRae6I", "description": "All videos of this series: http://doctorprodigious.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/arrhythmias-and-pacemaker-basics-hong-kong-university/", "title": "4.2.b.

One of the world's scariest fish, It is a member of the rattail fish family, and has the typical elongated pointed tail of the rattails, with a body length up to 2.5 meters.\n\nIt lives in perpetual darkness, in the deepest regions of the ocean known as the midnight zone. They can be found in the north pacific, the Bering seas and the gulf of Alaska and were a common sight around the remains of the titanic during the\nfilming expedition of the wreckage.\n\nThis apex predator remains close to the ocean floor where it searches for live prey. It primarily feeds on squid, but has been known to eat the carcass of the dead animals it comes across. The fish dominates its ecosystem and it is thought that about 15% of all deep sea fish are grenadiers.\n\nTheir long bodies help them to sense movement and vibrations in the water around them. They also have a photophore on their underside, this light emitting organ might be used as a spotlight on the ocean floor beneath them.\n\nWhile the rattails consists of over 400 species, the Giant grenadier is the only member of its genus, but laying more than 100,000 eggs they continue to ensure the species survival.\n\nLet's Connect\n-- \n-- \n-- \n-- \n-- /\n\nWorlds Scariest Deep Sea

Die frischen Bl\u00e4tter des Bachehrenpreis haben einen \u00e4hnlichen Geschmack wie die in der K\u00fcche verbreitete Kresse. Genau wie die Kresse gilt auch der Bachehrenpreis als blutreinigend. Bereits im Mittelalter wurden die Bl\u00e4tter und der frische Saft des Bachehrenpreis zur Behandlung von Ausschl\u00e4gen und Geschw\u00fcren gebraucht. Eine weitere im und am Wasser vorkommende Ehrenpreisart, der Gauchheilehrenpreis (Veronica anagallis aquatica L.), verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber fast die gleichen medizinischen Eigenschaften wie der Bachehrenpreis. Der Gauchheilehrenpreis bildet ungestielte Bl\u00e4tter mit einer l\u00e4nglichen, Ianzettf\u00f6rmigen und zum Blattende hin zugespitzten Form.\n\nDer zur Familie der Wegerichgew\u00e4chse geh\u00f6rende Bachehrenpreis (Veronica beccabunga) ist eine mehrj\u00e4hrig wachsende Pflanze. Je nach Standort erreicht der Bachehrenpreis eine Wuchsh\u00f6he von 25 bis 65 cm. Die Pflanze bildet kriechende Rhizome aus, der fleischige, zylindrisch geformte St\u00e4ngel des Bachehrenpreises sind im Inneren hohl. Die eirund-elliptisch geformten, an den R\u00e4ndern s\u00e4gef\u00f6rmig gez\u00e4hnten Bl\u00e4tter dieser krautigen Pflanze wachsen an kurzen Stielen. Der traubige Bl\u00fctenstand eines Bachehrenpreis bildet etwa 18 bis 26 Bl\u00fcten mit einem Durchmesser von etwa 4 bis 9 mm.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Bachehrenpreis\n\nDer in fast allen Gebieten Europas vorkommende Bachehrenpreis w\u00e4chst bis in H\u00f6henlagen von 2400 m. Bevorzugte Standorte des Bachehrenpreis  sind flache Gew\u00e4sser, an B\u00e4chen und Gr\u00e4ben, nasse Wiesen. Die Pflanzen lieben auch klare Flie\u00dfgew\u00e4ssern.

A mummified body, identified as a 51-year-old man based on the ID card found on his body, was discovered underneath the high-voltage utility vault.\n\nAn autopsy report reveals that the electricity cooked the man to death, evaporating all of his moisture in his body and turning it into a mummy, while he was trying to cut the wires more than a year ago. \n\nHe was found near the ladder in the manhole, holding a pair of bolt cutters with some cut copper wires nearby.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff investigators didn't say whether the man was trying to steal the wires or not.\n\nThe medical examiner can rehydrate his hands to retrieve fingerprints using a special procedure. Yet, because of the condition of the body, they don't think they are going to do fingerprints. They are hoping dental records or DNA comparison would help indentify the man.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

When company CEO Min-Liang Tan briefed us on the product, he was careful to dance around the word tracker. \"It's not a smartwatch,\" he said. \"It's not a fitness band.

But a Minnesota man has created an indoor fun house just for cats.\n\nHomeowner Greg Krueger loves trails and paths, and he loves his cats. So he decided to link those passions together.\n\nKrueger\u2019s four cats get to look down on their owner for nearly 100 yards of overhead catwalks. They can also scamper away to their choice of hideouts, all with proper lighting and padding.\n\nKrueger says \u201cTo me it feels like we\u2019re a family living here.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been at it for more than fifteen years, carving through his walls to create elaborate passageways. It\u2019s like a puzzle he say\u2019s that he never quite finishes\n\n\u201cI think about it constantly. I can\u2019t fall asleep. I\u2019m still thinking about it, thinking about the design. I wake up, I\u2019m thinking about it. I\u2019m thinking about it all day at work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an obsession that started making sense last fall when he saw a doctor.\n\n\u201cCause I have Asperger\u2019s syndrome, I\u2019m probably not the best at socializing.\u201d\n\nFinally diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome at the age of 49, Krueger considers his form of autism to be a blessing that gives him great focus.\n\n\u201cObviously, my house would not be like this if i didn\u2019t have Aspergers. If it takes a long time, I don\u2019t care, because if I like what I\u2019m doing, I almost don\u2019t want to finish what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s doing it for those who\u2019ve always seemed to understand him; from the time he was a boy. Others may see them as different, even distant, but Greg Krueger and his cats have a closeness that works.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I live alone, even though I\u2019m the only person living here.

At the beginning, twelve spheres are packed as closely as possible around a single central sphere. As the spheres shrink and disappear, they generate a polyhedron in which all edges and all radii are of equal length. This shape is what Fuller called a vector equilibrium. One of the characteristics of a vector equilibrium is its ability to contract by folding in on itself. The animation demonstrates how this simple geometric shape can be transformed to create several complex polyhedra. Next, it produces a different version of a vector equilibrium that Fuller called tensegrity\u2014short for a stable structure of tensional integrity. In the last part of the animation, a map of the entire globe is transferred onto the vector equilibrium, which unfolds to produce a flat map of the earth made from six squares and eight triangles. Unlike conventional world maps, Fuller's vector equilibrium map represents the world with minimal distortions to the relative size of the continents.\n\nFor more information on Buckminster Fuller, visit http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp", "title": "Animation depicting Fuller's geometric explorations - Whitney Museum", "publishedDate": "2008-06-30T18:46:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1W9bib_XMU8", "description": "Find the elm blossom and spot some of the Sussex coast's incredible elm trees!

First stage bloodsheds followed by the middle of the same year. By the year of 2003 Sacramental Blood had already become one of the most live-active Serbian metal bands, blood-staining stages all around Serbia and visiting Bulgaria and Macedonia for its first bloodsheds in abroad. In next 2 years band's strong live activity was continued despite few line up changes, introducing band to Bosnian and Hungarian fans as well. Debut material, entitled \"Inception of Ceremony\", was recorded during October/November 2005 and released on April 2006 as a split CD with Ophiolatry (Brazil) by Walk Records (Bosnia). First promotional bloodlettings swamped Bosnia (Sarajevo) and Serbia (Belgrade) at shows with Dutch death metal veterans Sinister. In July/August 2006 Sacramental Blood joined forces with Ophiolatry again and played its first European tour - EUROPEAN BLASTOUR 2006, which included 11 dates in Serbia, Macedonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Switzerland. The band was also booked for reputable Brutal Assault fest in Czech Republic and Metal Mania fest in Slovenia, but problem with getting visas cut Blastour and disabled band to hit Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Spain and two aforementioned festivals. During 2007/'08 Sacramental Blood has run through few line up changes again, but kept flowing all over Balkan area. Sacramental Blood was running for the first time through Romania on mini tour with Dakon (Rep Moldova), and finally completed material for the first full length cd (basic tracks were recorded during 2009). In 2009 Sacramental Blood was Storming the Balkans along with God Dethroned and Fleshgod Apocalypse, playing also for the first time in Slovenia and Greece. In March 2011 band entered D.A.B.ing studio in Belgrade and recorded 2 songs promo \"The Second Death\" which will be promoted on 2 weeks long \"Disgorging the Balkans 2011\" tour with Disgorge (Mexico) and Natron (Italy). Sacramental Blood has played so far more than eighty shows in Serbia, Bulgaria, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Macedonia, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Switzerland and Romania, sharing the stages with Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Behemoth, Vader, Sinister , God Dethroned, Skinless, Ophiolatry, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Arsbreed, Visceral Bleeding, Hypnos, Cripple Bastards, Fleshless and Parricide amongst many others...

STREETHIKERS will interact with the driver and the passenger, host and hostess, in an RV and the other participants. STREETHIKERS will advise them, give them a survivor's kit, and learn about them on roadside attraction stops.  STREETHIKERS would decide to help or hinder them from continuing their journey.  Some of the STREETHIKERS will get a bus ticket home to face their demon or solve their problems.     \n\nViewers will tune in to watch the dynamic of the interaction between these characters.  We will give them different challenges, which participants will argue and fight for them to position their spot or prizes for them to claim, to continue their journey or not.  In the confined space, problems and drama will arise and be solved or not but the journey will continue until someone gets kicked out of the RV.  Participants will learn to live with each other and be tolerant of different personalities.\n\nThe weekly challenges will be reviewed and the participants will change with each season with new STREETHIKERS.  The ending will have solutions, either a ticket back home or survivor kits to continue onward.  We will advise or create different solutions from professionals as well as the teams of STREETHIKERS to solve and help them with their plethora of problems.\n\nThe driver and the passenger, should be a man and woman, and should be different as night and day.  STREETHIKERS will have the tuners tune in because the stories come from the common citizens.\n\nParticipants will be everyday men and women from every section of the urban or rural areas of the world. \n\n\n-- \nSECRETS KEPT MOVIE -- script, media kit, business plan, etc.  https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B51gb9AA9EYwZTdEREI0aEk3XzA/edit\n\nVoice messages from SECRETS KEPT movie team members..  http://youtu.be/j1LDbOONsdI\n\nVisit books and movies from CHAU VAN TRUONG at http://youtu.be/6hYNUXNpmDo ...  http://youtu.be/UXoOXN5YULE ... http://www.myspace.com/naisamafia ..

Setting out his priorities, Europe was number one.\n\nAnnouncing visits to Paris, Berlin and Brussels he called on Europe to ease off austerity in order to be the motor for change and to reconnect with the people.\n\n\"On the international and European scene, Italy will be engaged in finding strategies to revive growth without disturbing the recovery of public finances. Europe is encountering a crisis of legitimacy and efficiency, just when European countries need it most,\" he said.\n\nHe also called for tax breaks for the young and workers, a pay cut for ministers, and an end to the unpopular housing tax, a condition for centre-right coalition partners to fall in line.\n\n\"Another key issue is justice: only with legal certainty can investments flourish. That is to say, the commitment to moralization of public life, the fight against corruption, corruption which distorts rules and incentives,\" explained Letta.  \n\nThe speech aimed to address the economic desperation in Italy which allegedly led a gunman to shoot two police officers Sunday as the new cabinet were sworn in. Letta paid tribute to the injured carabinieri whom he had visited in hospital.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Italy: New PM sets out priorities ahead of confidence vote", "publishedDate": "2013-04-29T17:27:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XAh944o_LM", "description": "---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCeleb news, star style, interviews and more fun stuff visit: http://www.heatworld.com/\nFollow us on Twitter: @heatworld\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/heatworld\nAnd don't forget to subscribe to our channel to be the first to see new videos:  http://bit.ly/tN9KRU", "title": "Danny Dyer Red Carpet National Television Awards 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-01-23T14:52:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XB7uVWOyVQ", "description": "Continuing the video.", "title": "1-31-13 Rabbit chase part 2", "publishedDate": "2013-01-31T23:09:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XBmu1kPpfE", "description": "The yellow marked boundaries on the left show the detected screen and the red boundaries on the the right show the same screen region after Inverse Projective Transformation.", "title": "Affine Screen Detection.avi", "publishedDate": "2012-05-08T18:08:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XBtuT_JepY", "description": "Sue Beri  \nSales Representative\nCell: 647-237-4783 | Office: 905-568-2121\nEmail: sberi@trebnet.com  \nRoyal LePage Kingsbury Realty, Brokerage\n30 Eglinton Avenue West suite 200, Mississauga, Ontario\n\nPowered by http://www.realmedia.ca", "title": "3642 Pitch Pine Crescent Mississauga Sue Beri", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T05:19:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XC1P_VD1sc", "description": "Ballon Fish\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#\nImages for balloon fish\n\n#\nTetraodontidae - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontidae\n\u200e\n\n    * Cached\n    * Similar\n\nThe family includes many familiar species, which are variously called pufferfish,\npuffers, balloonfish, blowfish, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, ...\n\u200eFugu - \u200eTetrodotoxin - \u200eGolden poison frog - \u200ePorcupinefish\n#\nBalloon fish! - YouTube\n\u25ba 0:24\n www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD5Y3KWQxLE9 Aug 2007 - 24 sec - Uploaded by diversandokan\nBalloon fish! ...

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues.
