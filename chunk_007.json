According to the report, a source close to the couple confirmed they are expecting a child.\n\nIs Kylie Minogue about to be a mom to a little boy or girl?\nSpeculation is rampant that Kylie Minogue is expecting a baby with long-time partner after she was spotted with a prominent stomach bulge on Friday evening (January 4, 2013), during romantic dinner date nearby her place.\n\nAnother source revealed that \"she TWICE made toasts ... by drinking water instead of wine,\" adding that it is \"highly unusual\" to \"toast with anything but a full glass of wine.\" (In case you weren't aware, pregnant ladies aren't supposed to drink alcohol. It specifically says that in \"What to Expect When You're Expecting.\")\n\nTwitter reacts to Kylie Minogue pregnancy rumor\n\nThe singer's rep told journalist, \"I do not comment on her personal life,\"... and therefore has neither confirmed nor denied. This has caused multiple stories about the alleged pregnancy to make their way through bulletin boards and other social media sites during the past 24 hours, just following engagement rumors earlier this week.\n\nNow we'll have to wait and see if that 'baby bump' and that 'high-profile wine-voidance' are the key clues that ultimately lead to the Best Famous Baby News of the year.\n\nhttp://en.mediamass.net/people/kylie-minogue/pregnancy-rumors.html", "title": "Is Kylie Minogue really pregnant?", "publishedDate": "2013-01-06T11:04:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NlBPcG28NE", "description": "Contruccion primera parte", "title": "Antena colineal doble 5/8 de vhf", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T13:53:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NlacEonPHo", "description": "Vertebral Subluxation complex is a dysfunctional biomechanical spinal segment which is fixated, that actively alters neurological function, which in turn leads to neuromusculoskeletal and visceral disorders", "title": "Chiropractor - Whats a Subluxation", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T13:51:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Nld1ZAjAyQ", "description": "Lovely compact plants, which produce an abundance of 'antique' red flowers.

Nuestra \u00e1rea genital tiene un mayor n\u00famero de c\u00e9lulas de la mucosa, es decir, las c\u00e9lulas que contienen fluidos corporales.\n\nOtra raz\u00f3n es nuestro ciclo menstrual. Se considera que durante este ciclo de los cambios hormonales afectan nuestro sistema inmune.

Tambi\u00e9n pueden ocurrir en otras \u00e1reas, como las nalgas y los muslos.\n\nEstas primeras lesiones son infecciosas para un promedio de 3 semanas (ya que en los hombres).

Quello che la polizia sta cercando di ricostruire, e quanto si teme di pi\u00f9, \u00e8 una nuova esplosione della faida di Scampia. Esposito, 48 anni, \u00e8 stato ucciso proprio nel Rione Berlingieri, venerd\u00ec sera, intorno alle 19.\n\nSecondo una prima ricostruzione delle forze dell'ordine, l'uomo stava scappando dai sicari ed ha provato a trovare rifugio all'interno del bar Mary, in via Monte Tifata, al numero 43. Qui \u00e8 stato ucciso con 5 colpi di pistola di cui 3 alla testa. Questa ricostruzione \u00e8 avallata dal numero dei bossoli che la polizia, che sta conducendo le indagini, ha trovato.

Per gli inquirenti non rientrava nella faida. Ma quel che \u00e8 certo \u00e8 che la camorra, tra Napoli e provincia, sta facendo salire sempre di pi\u00f9 il numero dei morti ammazzati.

Insulin resistant cells cannot take in glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Thus, glucose, fatty acids and amino acids 'leak' out of the cells. A decrease in insulin/glucagon ratio inhibits glycolysis which in turn decreases energy production. The resulting increase in blood glucose may raise levels outside the normal range and cause adverse health effects, depending on dietary conditions.\n\nhttp://www.newswire.net/newsroom/pr/00077984-insulin-resistance-remedies.html\n\nhttp://www.prweb.com/releases/insulin-resistance/managing-high-blood-sugar/prweb11282631.htm\n\nThe body produces insulin, but the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to hyperglycemia. If undetected, this can indicate wider health problems such as high blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\nWhat causes insulin resistance\n\nIt is well known that insulin resistance commonly coexists with obesity. Elevated levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood stream and tissues have been found to contribute to diminished insulin sensitivity. These are correlated with excess body fat. Primarily cause by dieting choice a sedentary lifestyle and smoking have also been linked to the causes of insulin sensitivity. Signs of high blood sugar may be a warning sign that the body is developing an insulin sensitivity and should be enough cause for concern to get it remedied quickly. Additional signs include sleepiness after meals, increased blood pressure, as well as weight gain, fat storage, and difficulty losing weight.\n\nHow to manage it\n\nThere are three ways to manage insulin resistance: diet, exercise, and supplements. The most important is in a person's diet, and making proper nutritional choices is the first step.\n\nDiet: To keep your insulin resistance from increasing, always eat a good breakfast. Breakfast provides a kickstart to your metabolism that plays a crucial role in helping your body properly process insulin. Grabbing a quick snack instead of a balanced meal will make it hard to keep your blood sugar levels stable throughout the day. To reduce your body's insulin resistance, eat plenty of rye. Whole-grain rye is rich in fiber, and has been shown to naturally increase your body's insulin secretion. This is directly linked to a lower insulin resistance, and helps to increase your body's sensitivity to insulin. Try eating rye pasta with a food rich in lycopene, like tomatoes.\n\nExercise: Start an appropriate exercise regime. Choose something that is customized for current fitness levels. Any exercise will vastly improve overall nutrition, and once comfortable with the current routine step it up to something a little more vigorous. You may be able lose the fat that causes insulin resistance, but it will always be there waiting for you to give it a foothold to take your body back over. Stay on track with your diet changes and increase in exercise for the rest of your life.\n\nSupplements: There are a variety of supplements available to help with insulin resistance. Cinnamomum Cassia, a potent extract harvested from Indonesian cinnamon bark that has been shown to effectively assist in managing blood sugar It is 100% pure, does not undergo any irradiation whatsoever, and is concentrated by 400% to contain robust levels of the active ingredients for unparalleled effectiveness. Also, a rare plant alkaloid called Berberine, which has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine by healers in India. Berberine works slightly differently, by improving the signaling between insulin and its associated receptors while also increasing glucose uptake by skeletal muscle not fat. Look for foods or supplements that contain both to reverse insulin resistance and start a healthier life.", "title": "Importance of Managing Insulin Resistance", "publishedDate": "2013-10-26T16:09:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-NybadJ8QBc", "description": "Like this video?

Well first you might look for rare cards, you might look for extremely rare cards, picture holo cards. In fact some people collect entire sets of reverse holos. You might want to collect an entire set, have a collection, so every card in a sequence will be in your binder. You might have a favorite Pokemon you want to collect \u2014 that's fair game, too. So now, you know what you're collecting, where are you going to get it? You can buy these cards in toy and hobby shops, comic book shops, you can buy them online, even in department stores. Anywhere games are sold, there's a good chance you're going to find these trading cards. Pokemon cards come in a variety of products. The most popular are of course the ten-card booster packs. Another kind would be a theme deck \u2014 that's a pre-made deck of 60 cards. This is also where you're going to find a lot of your energy cards. If you really want to get a lot of booster packs in one shot, you can buy an entire box of 36 booster packs. There are also blister packs, collectible tins. These are 40 cards plus a promo. And then there's the collection box.

There are a lot of different words used to describe similar strokes in table tennis and if you ask different people, you'll probably get different answers. We tend to think of loops and topspins as the same type of stroke. A loop may be a slightly higher, loopier stroke and a topspin might be faster. Don't get too caught up in terminology, all of the forehand strokes that use topspin can be thought of extensions of each other. Go out and practice and improve your skills.\n\nThanks for watching!

Lenders now have an objective way to assess a borrower's application, which also removes bias and helps lenders offer better terms to those with high scores.\n\nCredit scoring is based on a numeric scale, using data provided by the \"Big Three\" credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. The scores help lenders determine the level of credit risk a Oakland County borrower may present to investors. Depending on the score, the borrower is rated A, B, C or D. Obviously, the higher the score, the lower the risk of default. This improves the options for the borrower in Oakland County and can reduce overall borrowing costs on their New Oakland County home.\nhttp://homes2moveyou.com/buying-a-home-in-oakland-county-mi-take-this-free-video-credit-course", "title": "Oakland-County-Home-Buyers-Credit-Course (Number4)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T20:10:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-OI6QILPDlo", "description": "This movie shows a whole pancreatic beta cell I reconstructed in 2007 using a technique I call \"Whole Cell Tomography\" at relatively \"low resolution\" (15-20 nm) using Electron Tomography (ET).

Doing the proper workouts and exercises that are going to not only help you abs, but they will help the other important muscles involved with your core.\n\nWhen I say \"core workouts\" I mean from your knees to your lower pec.  That is what I consider you \"core\".  So as an athlete you aren't solely looking to get ripped, chiseled, to have the 6 pack \"six pack\", but you are looking to become more athletic and increase your performance as an athlete. \n\nIn this video I break down 2 of my favorite \"ab exercises\" that will help you build this athleticism.  Understand that I am trying to just get you a \"6 pack\" but I am working to  increase the balance and coordination of your body as a whole. \n\nSo quit doing phony workouts that are promising you \"6 pack abs\" and saying that is going to make you a better athlete.  You need to focus on your core strength if you want to increase your performance on the field or court.  \"six pack abs\" are great, but what's a \"6 pack\" if you can't perform well on the field?\n\nBelow are some of the terms you may have suffered from in your past searches to increase your athleticism.

Furthermore, depending on the lending system employed, in order to compensate lenders for the risk that they are taking, the amount of interest charged for peer to peer loans may be higher than traditional prime loans\n\nMiserable bank savings rates have led depositors to turn to \"peer-to-peer\" companies such as Zopa, RateSetter and Funding Circle for extra income.\n\nThanks to their slimline structures, peer-to-peer firms can offer better loan rates to borrowers and higher returns to investors. Similar to eBay, the peer-to-peer platform takes a cut for its matchmaking services.\n\nThere is a small manufacturing company in the northwest of England that is looking for \u00a3150,000 of working capital. It is traditionally the kind of need that might have been met by a bank loan. But, in the post-crisis world of bank belt-tightening, it is now the bread-and-butter of upstart peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, then, that the industry is growing at breakneck speed. In the UK, P2P has grown from nothing in 2007 to lending nearly \u00a3380m at the last count. There are other hotspots -- most obviously in the US -- where the two biggest P2P operators have together lent more than $1.7bn over five or six years; but also in less developed financial markets, such as China and eastern Europe. Even the establishment is taking notice. Lending Club, the leading US operator, now has a beefy board including the likes of John Mack, former head of Morgan Stanley, and Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary.\n\nIn the UK, meanwhile, the local arm of Spain's Santander is preparing to team up with Funding Circle to help finance SME loans -- in an echo of similar link-ups in the US. At the same time, Morgan Stanley has given its wealth management clients access to investments in Lending Club.\n\nP2P has a long way to go. The industry lends a few billion dollars, which is microscopic in the global scheme of things. Even after shrinkage, there are 28 banks with assets of more than $1tn each.\n\nNevertheless, the excitement surrounding P2P is palpable, prompting some existential questions. Could this quick, dynamic, empowering, fast-growing form of lending change the face of finance for ever? Could P2P do to banks what Amazon has done to Walmart, and what Twitter is doing to media brands?\n\nLess than a decade ago, peer-to-peer lending came to the United States as an upstart enterprise - a service that would in a very personal way link would-be borrowers with individual lenders and bypass the banking industry.\n\nBoth Lending Club and Prosper say they placed a record number of new loans in April, with the former at $140 million in loans and the latter at $20 million. While that still may represent only a drop in the broader consumer-finance bucket, it is attracting attention, and more money. By acting as intermediaries, the lending services collect fees ranging from 1 to 5 percent from borrowers.\npeer2peer \"peer 2 peer loan\" loan lending bank banking global \"lending club\" trends trends trending \"peer 2 peer lending\" online marketplace price portfolio \"small loan\" borrow borrower investor investing \"interest rate\" individual \"loan application\" grade diversify u.s. \"united states\" u.s. america \"loan interest rate\" \"online banking\" wealth wealthy elite future savings \"savings account\" \"wall street\" gold silver bullion investment \"make money\" money usd usa american uk \"united kingdom\" england news media 2013 london europe markets 829speedy The industry has won some high-profile endorsements of sorts. Google Inc led a $125 million refinancing of Lending Club in May, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers serves on the company's board, for example. Prosper has picked up new venture funding.\n\nBut it is not just the venture funding that is distinguishing the new era of P2P - it is the involvement of a new breed of lenders. With bonds disappointing and bank instrument interest rates near record lows, professional investors are lending through major P2P sites to bolster their returns.\n\nTHOSE PESKY DEFAULT RATES\n\nDIVERSIFICATION\n\nTo minimize the risks of those default rates, experts recommend that investors stay highly diversified, lending around $25 to each borrower in their portfolio.

Una eventraci\u00f3n es una hernia que aparece en la zona de incisi\u00f3n de una anterior intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica sobre el abdomen, pudiendo suceder al poco tiempo de la intervenci\u00f3n o pasados algunos a\u00f1os.

El principal riesgo que presenta es que se estrangule, es decir cuando estructuras del interior del abdomen quedan atrapadas en el interior de la hernia y no pueden volver a la cavidad abdominal. En estos casos pueden producirse alteraciones en el flujo sangu\u00edneo y aparecer serias complicaciones que pueden, incluso, provocar la muerte. Cuando la hernia se estrangula es imprescindible una intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica urgente que suele ser m\u00e1s complicada y tener mayor riesgo que cuando se realiza la intervenci\u00f3n de forma programada.\n\nDefinition of EVENTRATION:: protrusion of abdominal organs through the abdominal wall", "title": "Eventraci\u00f3n herida operatoria colecistectom\u00eda- Abdominal Eventration post cholecystectomy", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T00:33:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-O_6eWqbHIY", "description": "In this scene from \"Sordid Lives: The Series\", Beehive salon hairdresser Roger (Scott Presley) goes off on the pastor's wife Mrs. Barnes (Sharon Garrison) after she snaps at him for his use of language.

Which is sort of equivilent to having a ship stuck in deep water. You don't try to raise the ship. You try to move it from the deep water to the shallow water and then get it from there.\"\n\nPIPE DREAM - WISHFUL THINKING - periodontal abscess - Turns out there were four more abscesses. Multiple ledges of calculus defending the abscess complex.\n\nHopes for large scale self-debridement w HYALURONIC ACID - HILA - HA - No  way the HA would have penetrated significantly. PIPE DREAM.\n\nSOLUTION was to dismantle and destroy the calculus ledges. Sir you destroyed the calculus fortresses surrounding your teeth but you lost your bone.\n\nTHINKING could have dismantled thick calculus ridges with HILO was a PIPE DREAM. The answer was the CURETTE not the HILO. But nonetheless TOOTH IS TOAST. All I managed to do was to KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.\n\nThe hyaluronic acid was helpful to flush out crud that wanted to exit. Still think it can help hydrate the calculus and make it easier to either curette or just break out on their own. Would get fairly good sized bloody colonies of crud to exit. But have not done so religiously. Think it could do a good job to hydrade surface areas and make them easier to scrape off. Especially if done as part of a serious routine, including fairly vigourous physical debridement too. But I don't bother to try to soften the calculus first. \n\nNOTE - 12-12-12 - Other main debridement helper is the papaine-urea-water mix. Which has been standard therapy for over 100 years. But the FDA banned all commercial products. So to make this basic mixture now use even parts of urea and papaine. Bought urea on the web. Mixing with crushed Chewable Papaya Pills. Not happy about the extra ingredients. So may just add the urea to Pinapple Juice. Cheap emulsifiers have proved problematic. Think will experiment with honey. Could also possibly go Aloe. But pretty confident with the honey. Just have to test out the extreme pain factor first. Issue is the mix dissolves dead protein. Which means geletin sounds like a poor emulsifier. But could go last minute.\n\nSUMMARY - Now believe more vigorous debridement of singular areas to completely exhaust them is the way to go. Don't wait two months for the area to fully recover. Instead go back after two weeks and keep going until the calculus is completely gone. This includes risking going in completely inside. And just hang out. Just don't scrape! Instead be a scavenger.\n\nNow switching to the Urea-Papaine debridement. With Lecithin as the emulsifier. Think it will work out great. Have already gotten good results with the water mix. And no bad reactions. Though one area did feel a little swollen. But that is to be expected.", "title": "t28 Bicuspid - PIPE DREAM - Raise Titanic w Hyaluronic Acid - HILA - HA!", "publishedDate": "2012-12-09T06:28:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Or53MI6D0U", "description": "Just shooting the Pardner single shot with some target shot!", "title": "Pardner single shot 12 gauge!", "publishedDate": "2011-09-05T15:48:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Or60NAQhnM", "description": "Best Friend - Oscar", "title": "Best Friend - Oscar", "publishedDate": "2013-03-14T05:36:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Or7Ltkal5k", "description": "Just wanted to actually get a start on doing covers..hope you enjoy (:\nThe song is \"I am Changing\" from Dreamgirls, hopefully you appreciate the song as well!\n\n(I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THIS SONG)\n\nQuestions?

Here I talk about what a calorie actually is and whether this type of diet is sustainable for weight loss. I have a background in nutrition and work as a hypnotherapist helping people to lose weight. \nAre you a calorie counter? Do you feel it's effective for weightloss?\n\nDo you know what a calorie is? It's the amount of energy it take to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree C. How do they determine this? They... wait for it....Burn food underneath a container of water and notice the temperature change!  As if the process of burning food in air is the same as our digestion and creation of energy from food. The theory of calories in, calories out, much beloved by the traditional weight management establishment, is so overly simplistic. It doesn't take into account the way fat, carbohydrate and protein are all used and turned into energy differently or the different speeds at which foods release sugar into the blood stream. \n\nDuring the second world war, an American scientist called Ancel Keyes carried out a study(2) whereby volunteers were put on a 'starvation diet' so that they could test the best way to rehabilitate POW's when they got out. Within a few weeks of the study, the healthy young participants were becoming mentally disturbed. Their ambition waned, self-discipline went out the window and their alertness and ability to focus dropped. Some were even hospitalised in a psychiatric ward. They were on a 1570 calorie a day diet. \n\nClearly, this isn't a long term solution for anybody. So what is the answer? Change your relationship with food. Cook meals from scratch. Manage your stress levels and emotions in a way that doesn't involve food. Find some exercise that you love. Get \n\n1) Keys, A., Bro\u017eek, J., Henschel, A., Mickelsen, O., & Taylor, H.

All you could see was the deep blue sky and a luminous burst of light from the sun.  The water on the Eagle River was moving with erratic behavior which is odd because usually it flows in a calm fashion.  \n I could see my brother Andrew across the way, still contemplating which fly he should use.  I found a nice eddy that led into a pool the size of a small car.  I could not see into the dark blue water but I knew that there was a large trout waiting like a customer at the deli counter.   If I could catch the largest trout of the day I would start off this year on a good note.  At the end of the day we would see who caught the largest fish and the other would have to cook the catch while the winner enjoyed a cold beer and a hundred dollars.  \n I stayed at the same pool trying everything in my fly box, but nothing worked.  My brother, who was now about a fifty yards upstream, was hopping from rock to rock in a grasshopper fashion in search of easy fish.  My brother was yelling that maybe this was his year and that my luck was up.  But I knew this would soon change.\n  I tied on the smallest fly just hoping to get a smaller fish to bite.  I hoped this would invoke the feeding instinct inside of a larger trout. Again I tried over and over again but still nothing bit.  At this point my brother had gone around the bend of the river.  Finally something bit my line, I set the hook but I could feel at once that it was tiny.  I stripped in the line, took out the hook, and let the fish back into the water.\n \"It's really just not my day today,\" I said out loud to myself.\n I finally began to move up stream, but I cast my line back out in front of the pool one last time.   As I trudged slowly through the water, my pole gave a tug on the line and I was instantly enraged.  I had snagged my fly on a rock.  But then the line began to fly out of my reel like a kite on a windy day.  At the same time I heard a splash and was excited for a fun fight.  But instead I saw something that surprised me.  Across the river, about 50 yards away, I saw a two hundred pound brown bear standing in about a foot of water.  \n I heard another splash and saw a large rainbow trout enter back into the water.  But I was not the only one who saw the movement.  The bear impulsively started to move towards the fish.  I tried to bring the fish into the shallow water near me.  I wanted to get the fish off of my line and into my creel.  I could tell that this fish was over 22 inches.  Each time the fish broke the surface or made a splash, the bear became interested in it and soon it was directly across the stream from me.  I could feel each heart beat as I tried to reach out to my brother but he was not in sight.  I was by myself with no one to help.\n The thought immediately crossed my mind to cut the line and slowly walk away.  But I knew that this fish would be the largest fish for perhaps the whole year and I could not imagine letting it go.  I finally got the fish close to me in the shallows but this allowed the bear to see the fish clearly.  He immediately began to cross the river.  He swam right over the pool where I had been fishing all day.  By the time I got the hook out, it was too late and the bear was standing eight feet away from me.  I glimpsed straight into his dark blue eyes and was immediately taken back by his sense of power and brute strength.\n I tried to back up to place the fish in my creel, but the bear lurched forward and gave off a slight roar.  I looked for my brother but he was still not visible.  Throwing the fish to the bear was not an option.  I had caught the fish and it belonged to me.  My decision was made.\n I tossed the fish as far as I could downstream.  I watched the fish splash into the water and the bear chase after it.  The fish surged down the river in a prison break but the bear was closing in on it.  Just as it seemed that the bear was going to catch the fish, it plummeted down into a pool and became safe from the danger of the bear.  \n When I got to my brother, I told him what happened but he was dubious until we walked across the river and saw the big brown bounding about in the water to find his fish.  We decided that it was best to leave.\n Three days later we went back to Eagle River.  I was not afraid to go back after my day with the big brown.  I fished in the same pool, looking for that monster fish again.  And in that same deep blue pool I saw those dangerous blue eyes of the brown bear.  My brother might have won that day but I would not let him or the bear keep me away from fishing.  \n\n\n\n \u00a9 2013 Jack White", "title": "The Deep Blue", "publishedDate": "2013-10-04T06:12:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-OxmN6QrcYM", "description": "so my UnderCover Flex cover is great!! i got nothing bad to say about and i get complements about it all  the time now from family to people at the store. i went threw 2 car washes in a day to really test it out and i just loaded my 4 wheeler to test out if  could load it up without taking the cover fully off and i can which is nice. but over all i would get another if i had to. \n\ncall up tony or joe in customer service from flexfactorydirect.com and they can answer all your questions and take care of you like they did for me.

Skillsets host a range of abilities, from Sorcery's devastating spells to Songcraft's soothing ballads. Each one levels up independently (as you gain experience with a Skillset, you will unlock its array of powers) and over time you can master them all.\n\nAfter reaching level 10, you can combine any three Skillsets to make a unique Class. You can swap Skillsets in and out to change Classes as often as you like, with no predefined path to follow. Experiment and discover Classes to fit any situation, and all with the same character!\n\nArcheAge is an MMORPG developed by Korean developer Jake Song (former developer of Lineage) and his development company, XL Games. The game was released in Korea on January 15, 2013 and has also had a closed beta in China. ArcheAge is described as a \"sandpark\", \"sandbox\" MMORPG, which the developers say is a hybrid of the open content style of a \"sandbox\" game, and the more structured play experience of a \"themepark\" game.\n--------------------------------------\nPlease feel free to subscribe, like and comments \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AngelOfGraceGaming\n\nAngelOfGrace Gaming Official Website: http://www.angelofgracegaming.com/\n\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/_AngelOfGrace_\nTwitch:  http://www.twitch.tv/angelofgrace_\nFacebook:  http://www.facebook.com/AngelOfGraceGaming\n---------------------------------------------------\nIntroduction & Conclusion Music for Promo Trailer:\nLicense Rights and terms: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n-----------------------------------\nThe Intro templates as been created by Laurent Caccia,(www.youtube.com/laurentcaccia) and modified by AngelOfGrace Gaming.", "title": "ArcheAge (NA-English, Alpha) | The Harani (Sorcery/Occultism/Vitalism) Gameplay | Part 16", "publishedDate": "2014-06-17T14:58:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-P8Z_-vYhcc", "description": "", "title": "Encore une glace chez Berthillon Paris", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T07:31:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-P8z3S30WyY", "description": "", "title": "Exodontia Premolar xvid", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T15:51:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-P96eGfYdI8", "description": "The garlic mustard invasion", "title": "Garlic Mustard Invasion", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T18:38:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PA1HZJswNQ", "description": "The best way to feed your turtles out of the inclosure. \n\n\nThe best way to feed your turtles out of the inclosure", "title": "How to fead your turtles out of the inclosure", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T11:54:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PAgNp-x3rE", "description": "House Paint Ideas\n\n\n\n\n\nhouse paint ideas exterior nz\nhouse painting tips and tricks\nhouse paint ideas interior\nhouse paint color ideas\nhouse painting tips\nhouse paint ideas pictures\nHow-to Choose Paint Colors \nLiving room paint colors ideas \nhouse painting exterior\nhouse painting\nhouse paint ideas pinterest\nhouse paint ideas\nHow To Choose Paint Colors For Bedrooms, Dining and Living Room Like Professional \nhouse painting techniques\nhouse paint ideas malaysia", "title": "House Paint Ideas", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T19:48:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PAlGwXn-2Q", "description": "Sterrenbeke - buiten wonen in de stad!\n\nWonen vlakbij de gezellige, bruisende binnenstad van Arnhem.

Brilliant orange and yellow colored Oleander Aphids feed on the plant as well.

I have also found Tapinoma sessile, the odorous house ant, stealing nectar from the flowers. \n\nLastly I finally got proof of the hummingbird visiting my yard.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Best of Miami's Duke Johnson vs Virginia Tech", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T04:08:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PMDYjD21E0", "description": "Michael Jackson meets Marcel Marceau.", "title": "Michael Jackson meets Marcel Marceau", "publishedDate": "2010-11-25T14:57:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PMWfQzeqXk", "description": "(Video strictly for news/educational purposes). \nThe United States Central Command has just released footage showing some recent strikes on Isis.

Though it's hard to conceptualize in the modern, mass-production  scheme of the industrialized world, chickens were once tree-dwelling wild birds whose natural habitat was limited to certain tropical jungles of southeast Asia. \n\nSadly, for nothing other than the widely-savored taste of chickens' flesh and eggs, the \"poultry\"  and egg industries have exploded exponentially worldwide, and hideously transformed these docile, gentle, beautiful birds into a big agribusiness enterprise, wherein they are reduced to nothing more than \"meat machines\" and \"egg factories\"  who live and die exclusively for human convenience and pleasure. Each year in this country, the more than 9 billion chickens grown (not raised) for meat, a.k.a. \"broilers, \" endure the most horribly unnatural conditions one could imagine in filthy, overcrowded confinement sheds, where they are denied all natural light and every other element essential to their fundamental health and well-being. These creatures are genetically manipulated to maximize muscle-tissue (meat) growth, so that their legs are often incapable of supporting their unnaturally increasing bodyweight, resulting in lameness, arthritis and other diseases. \n\n\"Broiler\"  chickens are subjected to an additional array of unthinkable horrors before, a mere 45 days after birth, they are brutally killed and cut to pieces for cold hard profit, and to satisfy the voracious appetites of our species, though an infinite number of healthier, more economical and more ethical alternatives to animal proteins are accessible to all of us in the United States today. \n\nEgg laying hens, a.k.a \"layers\" , have their beaks violently removed by a hot blade with no anesthesia so they don't peck each other to death from the maddening, hellish, filthy, unnatural, obscenely crowded and disease-ridden wire cages they are forced to endure as they produce eggs until they are literally spent from exhaustion, calcium depletion, osteoporosis & other diseases. After one or two years of being continuously exploited as nothing more than \"egg factories\" , \"spent\"  hens are simply destroyed by the most economical means, or sold to be subjected to further abuses and eventually slaughtered. \n\nFor more information on the commercial poultry & egg industries' treatment of both \"broiler\"  and \"layer\"  chickens, please check out this very solid catalogue of resources from United Poultry Concerns: \n\nhttp://www.upc-online.org/industry/plight.html\n\nhttp://www.upc-online.org/resources.html\n\nhttp://www.upc-online.org/livemarkets/live_poultry_markets.html\n\nIn these hellish places, where the odors of death, fear and intense confinement are perpetually acrid and inescapable, live birds are stuffed together in cages so tightly that they can't even move. Such cages are stacked from floor to ceiling in these filthy dungeons, so that customers can walk in, select the animal(s) of their choice and even decide how the animal(s) will be killed and butchered, according to their individual preferences.\n\nThe hapless, selected animal-victim is removed from the public area into a godforsaken \"back room,\" where he/she is dispassionately killed in a bloody, grotesque, medieval manner (most commonly by severing the jugular vein or decapitation). The broken/mutilated creature is then brought back to the customers post-mortem, defeathered and sliced up in accordance with the customers' fickle palates.

The female has a uniform, rich chestnut breast and belly. However, both the male and the female have red and white streaks on the head.The diet of the Jungle Bush Quail consists mainly of seeds. particularly of grasses, although it also takes insects. Breeding takes place after the rains and lasts until the onset of colder weather, with the precise period varying across the range; five or six eggs are produced and incubation takes between 16 and 18 days. The species is not globally threatened as it has an extensive range and tends to avoid agricultural areas. The population in Sri Lanka has contracted since the 1950s, but is thought to be widespread and common elsewhere in the range.The Jungle Bush-Quail is largely sedentary, although the birds in Nepal are thought to migrate in winter.Jungle bush quail bird is one of the species of quails found in South Asia. The bird is usually seen in small coveys and is quite shy by nature. One can get a glimpse of the Jungle bush quails of India mainly when they burst out into flight from under the vegetation.The average height of Jungle bush quail is around 6.5 inches. The head of a male quail is red in color and has a slight brown mottling on top. The breast is speckled with white and black color. The back is spotted with black, brown and yellow. The female is also quite similar to the male, but the breast is speckled with pink/red instead of black and white. Behavior\nJungle bush quail is a very shy bird and is observed to be quite wary in the wild. They love to absorb sunrays and require a lot of grassy cover to adapt themselves to captivity. The male Jungle bush quail is very protective of the female as well as the newly hatched chicks. Jungle bush quails are gregarious by nature and are usually found in tight coveys of approximately a dozen birds. However, the males turn extremely aggressive as well as territorial during the mating season. Jungle bush quail survives on a diet comprising of a variety of grass and weed seeds, like pannicum, millet, maw and lentils. They also eat maggots and small insect larvae.The natural habitat of the Jungle bush quails mostly consists of the Indian dry grasslands. However, one can also find the bird in the wooded areas of the country. Apart from India, Jungle Bush Quail bird is found in Sri Lanka.\nMale Jungle Bush Quails attain maturity at about 6 months of age. The eggs are laid on consecutive days during the spring season i.e., around mid-April. The number of eggs laid falls between five and seven and is usually an odd number. The incubation period ranges from 19 to 20 days.", "title": "Jungle Bush Quail of Jamoda Padav Melghat by Shirishkumar Patil", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T07:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PcCRctHKI0", "description": "This little raincloud parked itself over our building in Stockholm, gently and apologetically unshouldering its burden for about 15 minutes.

Many individuals with GN relate the attacks of pain to specific trigger factors such as swallowing, drinking cold liquids, sneezing, coughing, talking, clearing the throat, and touching the gums or inside the mouth.  \n\nGN can be caused by compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve, but in some cases, no cause is evident.\n\nProduced By: Randy Clare and Associates", "title": "San Diego Headache and Facial Pain Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia.MOV", "publishedDate": "2011-09-09T02:56:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Pm62_c3N9M", "description": "No bleach was consumed in the making on this video.. lol\n\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/adrianvanoyen\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/AdrianVanOyen\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/NotYourAverageGoat", "title": "Drinking Bleach Prank", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T11:37:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PmGsfkxRMI", "description": "", "title": "GTI Getting it", "publishedDate": "2014-03-10T20:41:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-PmaxVcrbZE", "description": "ed ecco....LA CREATURA!", "title": "Barba Mastodont ultimate", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T12:17:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Pn3nQT-jGU", "description": "http://www.SilkScreeningSupplies.com  this video is taken from one of our training classes.

As Dudley spoke, reports emerged of airstrikes targeting demonstrations across the country,\" the social justice website Platform reported.\n\nBP and the government of Libya have a lucrative deal searching for offshore oil. \"BP signed a deal worth at least $900 million in 2007 to explore in Libya. It said it would monitor the situation on a daily basis and could not confirm when work would start again, but stressed that offshore operations in the region were still open and the closure would not impact oil production,\" the Associated Press reported as hostilities broke out between the government and protesters.\n\nBP was lobbying hard to secure the deal when Gaddafi sent his henchman to kill protesters during February 2006 demonstrations in Benghazi.\n\nThe deal represented the \"single largest exploration commitment in BP's 100-year history and the single biggest award of exploration acreage by Libya to an international energy company in modern times,\" according to the transnational corporation (citation in Arabic).\n\n\"The 54,000 square kilometers of acreage awarded to the company were four times the total of all other projects combined. The offshore Sirt basin block alone covers an area larger than Belgium. The terms of the Production Sharing Agreement signed were also more generous than those previously gained by US company Oxy and Austrian OMV,\" notes Platform.\n\nLike Saddam Hussein in oil-rich Iraq, Muammar al-Gaddafi is a PR disaster and does not fit into the new Middle East envisioned by the globalists and their multinational mega-corporations. The CIA and British intelligence engineered color revolutions in the Middle East are designed to install more user-friendly and up-to-date dictators and globalist stooges.\n\nGaddafi is old school and has to leave, as Madame Secretary Clinton insisted at the behest of her globalist bosses last week.\n\nThe civil war in Libya that now enjoys U.S and European air support was hardly underway when transnational oil corporations reached out and tried to negotiate assurances that their stakes in the country would be secure after Gaddafi is deposed or killed.\n\nOfficials in the rebel-held eastern part of Libya have bent over backwards to calm the oil industry. They said there was no shortage of exports from the region and that funds from oil sales would continue to be deposited in Libya's accounts, even if the OPEC member state comes under international sanction, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn short, it is business as usual in Libya \u2014 never mind the little war now underway. It is merely window dressing and part of a remodeling effort.\n\nAljazeera Reports Journalist Briefs Latest Update Interview News CBS CBSepisode ABC ABCnews Alex Jones Rand Ron Paul Judge Andrew Napolitano Mike Rivero Jeff Rense David Icke Wayne Madsen Webster Tarpley Paul Craig Roberts Gerald Celente Max Keiser Peter Schiff Bob Chapman John Pilger Stossel Rachel Maddow Chris Matthew Glenn Beck Rush Limbauh Bill O'Reilly Anderson Cooper Michael Savage Sarah Palin Julian Assange Wikileaks Dennis Kucinich Video Top Air Ground Over Government Infowars.com Fired Down Tomahawk Missile Death Toll Tanks Injuries Victims Military Asset Opposition Fight Fighting Launch Bloody Rage Unrest Hit Airstrikes Strikes Intervention Forces Torture Fierce Assault Embattled Condemns Rally Dance Islam Vows Residents Speech Ultimatum Allied Deaths \"Defense Secretary\" Colonel Casulties Funeral Coalition Threaten Enforcing Planes Warfare Fighter Jets Loyal Defiant Supporters Pentagon Joint Staff Vice Admiral Odyssey Dawn North Africa Al-Qaeda Iran Iraq Afghanistan Pakistan Russia China Susan Rice Nicolas Sarkozy Sarko David Cameron Muammar Gaddafi Moammar Qaddafi Admiral Mike Mullen Leader Official Chairman John McCain Joe Lieberman U.S. NATO UN United Nations Britain British UK France French International", "title": "END WAR: Celente On NATO Is US, Orweillian Pretext Of Humanitarian Crisis, Oil Is Motive", "publishedDate": "2011-03-31T00:54:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Q6Q0Q3tIOo", "description": "A selection of audio clips from Mael M\u00f3rdha's latest album \"Manann\u00e1n\".

Typically one character is printed for keypress, and the machine prints the characters by making ink impressions of type elements similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.\"\n\n\"Hall of Fame/inventor profile\"\n\nhttp://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/168.html\n\n\"As he experimented early on with different versions, Sholes realized that the levers in the type basket would jam when he arranged the keys in alphabetical order. He rearranged the keyboard to prevent levers from jamming when frequently used keys were utilized. The rearranged keys in the upper row formed the order QWERTY, and the design exists to this day.\"", "title": "The QWERTY Keyboard - Stuff of Genius", "publishedDate": "2013-02-21T18:01:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QKUgpxL2jc", "description": "5.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Give All to Love by Ralph Waldo Emerson", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T16:00:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QnoPJsG06o", "description": "", "title": "bala 15 jours", "publishedDate": "2009-11-08T17:33:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Qo2vBSWohA", "description": "Lay on floor facing ceiling\nPlace legs on ball between feet and calves\nSqueeze butt (glutes) brace abs then lift butt off ground\nDraw feet towards butt rolling ball and bending knees\nExtend legs back to starting position", "title": "Stability Ball Leg Curl", "publishedDate": "2011-06-23T16:59:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QoBsmkuvKE", "description": "Adam Levine and his design team talk about the importance of detail as they introduce the selvage denim shirt from the Adam Levine Collection.", "title": "The Adam Levine Collection: Selvage Denim Shirt", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T16:09:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QoDXj-hTwA", "description": "This video shows some common mistakes that can result in contaminated cell or tissue cultures, and how cell/tissue cultures flasks should be handled to avoid contamination.\n\nThe Basler & Hofmann workshop \"Working Safely in the Biosafety Cabinet\" will enable you to better protect the BSC operator and cultures from exposure and contamination, respectively. \n\nWorkshop information: www.gmuender.org/ftp/BSC.pdf", "title": "Biosafety Cabinet (BSC): Virus Culturing Practices (cell & tissue cultures)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-31T11:36:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QoHf29Evgw", "description": "Just killing gobos on T6.

His writings cover many subjects, including physics, metaphysics, poetry, theater, music, logic, rhetoric, linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology, and zoology. Together with Plato and Socrates (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics.\nAristotle's views on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the Renaissance, although they were ultimately replaced by Newtonian physics. In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic. In metaphysics, Aristotelianism had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions in the Middle Ages, and it continues to influence Christian theology, especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (Cicero described his literary style as \"a river of gold\"),[2] it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.[3]\nAristotle was born in Stageira, Chalcidice, in 384 BC, about 55 km (34 mi) east of modern-day Thessaloniki.[4] His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the aristocracy. At about the age of eighteen, he went to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before quitting Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.[5] He then traveled with Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) Pythias. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander the Great in 343 BC.[6]\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. In his Politics, Aristotle states that only one thing could justify monarchy, and that was if the virtue of the king and his family were greater than the virtue of the rest of the citizens put together. Tactfully, he included the young prince and his father in that category. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'.[7]", "title": "Best Quote of the Day : Aristotle \" Courage is the First of", "publishedDate": "2011-05-03T11:25:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "-QpwAjWaeyQ", "description": "", "title": "Pashto Song by Tadjik Singer Madina Saidzada_HIGH.mp4", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T00:05:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Qq2Jj11cYA", "description": "Organismo: Dist\u00farbio Verbal.\nM\u00fasica: O Jardim Secreto.\nCapta\u00e7\u00e3o das vozes e produ\u00e7\u00e3o musical por Willian Monteiro.\nMixagem: Moita e Willian Monteiro.\nFilmagem | edi\u00e7\u00e3o | produ\u00e7\u00e3o do v\u00eddeo por Chorma Audiovisual. \nRoteiro e dire\u00e7\u00e3o por Matheus Melo e Interno 860.\n\n-\nDownload do [EP] \"ARREBATE\":http://www.mediafire.com/download/i9wzlnv8apo698j/Dist\u00farbio_Verbal_Arrebate.rar\n-\n\nP\u00e1gina Oficial: :http://facebook.com/disturbioverbal\n-\n\nLetra:\n\nComo cercaram a minha vida, rondaram meus campos\nE deram por perdida a minha Terra Prometida.\nAgora me internaram aqui...

Come\u00e7ou a compor ainda crian\u00e7a, quando acompanhava o pai em andan\u00e7as pela lavoura, escrevendo versos no ch\u00e3o de terra com um peda\u00e7o de madeira. Com 11 anos de idade comp\u00f4s \"Quinze a sete\", numa homenagem a seu time de futebol.\nEm 1947, Jos\u00e9 Fortuna e Elclides Fortuna, criaram a dupla Z\u00e9 Fortuna e Pitangueira. No mesmo per\u00edodo, mudaram-se para S\u00e3o Pauloonde conheceram o acordeonista Juventus Merenda. Os tr\u00eas formaram ent\u00e3o um trio no qual Merenda ficou pouco tempo. Em 1948, conheceram o acordeonista Coqueirinho, formando com ele o trio \"Os Maracan\u00e3s\". Apresentaram-se no mesmo ano na R\u00e1dio Recordde S\u00e3o Paulo.\nEm 1953, a acordeonista Rosinha substituiu Coqueirinho, e Os Maracan\u00e3s passou a atuar com sucesso no programa \"Terra, sempre terra\", na R\u00e1dio Piratininga em S\u00e3o Paulo. Em 1956, gravaram o cateret\u00ea \"O selo de sangue\", de Z\u00e9 Fortuna e Pitangueira, e um de seus maiores sucessos. Em 1957, emplacaram outro sucesso com a valsa \"Lenda da valsa dos noivos\", de Z\u00e9 Fortuna e Pitangueira. Em 1958, passaram a atuar na R\u00e1dio Bandeirantes. Em 1962, foram para a R\u00e1dio Tupi. Em fins dos anos 1950, passou a fazer parte do trio o acordeonista Z\u00e9 do Fole, em lugar de Rosinha, dando assim forma definitiva ao trio \"Os Maracan\u00e3s\" at\u00e9 a sua dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o, em 1973.\nGravaram cerca de 40 LPs e diversos discos em 78 rota\u00e7\u00f5es.A maior parte das grava\u00e7\u00f5es do trio eram composi\u00e7\u00f5es dos irm\u00e3os Jos\u00e9 Fortuna e Pitangueira.\nJos\u00e9 Fortuna faleceu em 10 de novembro de 1983, v\u00edtima de doen\u00e7a de Chagas.

Die mediterrane und auch die mehrj\u00e4hrige nordamerikanische Lupinenart, die beide in unseren Zierg\u00e4rten angepflanzt werden, enthalten die giftigen Alkaloide Lupanin, Lupinin und Spartein. Diese Gifte k\u00f6nnen bei jeder Lupinenart gleichzeitig vorkommen. Bei Tieren, die Lupinen fra\u00dfen, wurden schon oft Vergiftungen festgestellt. Gekochte Lupinensamen hingegen sind nicht giftig und waren deshalb fr\u00fcher ein in manchen Gegenden weitverbreitetes Futtermittel. Die Lupinensamen dienten auch als Nahrung f\u00fcr den Menschen. So war bei den Griechen ein Lupinengericht beliebt, und w\u00e4hrend des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurden Lupinensamen als Kaffeeersatz verwendet.

O. Wilson's Life on Earth,\" a new digital textbook for high school biology students\n\nOur living planet faces unprecedented challenges. The most important tool we have to meet those challenges is education. The E. O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation has gathered together a contributor team consisting of educators, multimedia artists, 3D animators trained in science and cinema, and textbook professionals, led by naturalist Edward O. Wilson. Our goal is to create a cultural landmark\u2014a portal that will introduce students to the grandest story there is, the story of life on Earth, from molecules to ecosystems, from the origin of life to the modern awareness that we control the environment we live in. Forty-one chapters in nine sections will provide a complete, original, standards-based curriculum to give high school students a deep understanding of all of the central topics of introductory biology.\n\nDigital textbooks are poised to transform education. The richness and immediacy of vibrant multimedia lessons will transform how students learn and how instructors teach. As textbook developers of long experience, we're thrilled by the things we can deliver now that were never possible before. We can navigate inside a virtual cell. We can take students by helicopter to the Gorongosa landscape in Africa to explain the succession of plants and animals over time.\n\nToday's biology students will be tomorrow's biochemists, explorers, environmental policy makers, park rangers, and informed citizens. \"E. O. Wilson's Life on Earth\" is being created to prepare them for their work.\n\nTo learn more about E.O. Wilson and biodiversity, please visit eowilsonfoundation.org.", "title": "E.O.

Prod., 2008, 71 (9), pp 1513--15) This is because, like Viagra, Epimedium acts as a potent PDE-5 inhibitor, increasing nitric oxide levels and relaxing the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles.  This has the effect of increasing blood flow to the penis, which then results in an erection. Known throughout Asia as \"Horny Goat Weed,\" Epimedium has been used for thousands of years as a libido enhancer.  Legend has it that it was first discovered when a Chinese goat herder noticed the increased libido and copulating activities of his herd after eating the flowering plant.
