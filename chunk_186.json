Ivan was the leader of the group, writing the majority of the songs and providing the lead vocals; Stefan was the guitarist; and other members changed frequently throughout the course of the group's career. They independently released their debut EP, Folk of the '80s, in 1980; it was reissued the following year by Stiff in Britain. During 1982, the band consisted of Ivan, Stefan, another brother Colin Doroschuk (keyboards), along with drummer Allan McCarthy; this is the lineup that recorded Men Without Hats' 1982 debut album, Rhythm of Youth. Taken from their debut, the single \"The Safety Dance\" became a major hit, peaking on the American charts at number three in 1983. Driven by an insistent three-chord synthesizer riff, the song was one of the biggest synth pop hits of the new wave era. The group wasn't able to exploit its success, however. Folk of the '80s (Part III) stalled at number 127 on the charts in America and made even less of an impact in other parts of the world. Thanks to the minor-hit title track, 1987's Pop Goes the World was a bigger success, yet it didn't recapture the audience their first album had gained. Released two years later, The Adventures of Women & Men Without Hate in the 21st Century failed to chart, as did its follow-up, 1991's Sideways. The two albums' lack of success effectively put an end to Men Without Hats' career.\nHot Tub Time Machine", "title": "Safety Dance - Men Without Hats Official Video", "publishedDate": "2010-04-16T21:23:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjPb4CAC7gc", "description": "Samsung Home Appliances built a larger-than-life artwork in the middle of Church Square, Cape Town, and invited passers-by to come in and explore.

Ambitious, expansive but brilliantly cohesive, \"Stick By This\" joins the dots between Booka Shade's melodic electronica (\"Falling\"), Leftfield's dub techno (\"I'm Running\"), the classic musicality of MJ Cole (\"Lost In You\") and warm Laurent Garnier-esque techno (\"Need You Back\").\n\nAdding further colour to the album's spectrum, the album's first single - \"Lost In You\" - is a deep, bass-driven piano house anthem that features the soulful vocals of Janai and has gained props from US house godfather Tony Humphries and UK bass talent Toddla T -- the latter supporting the track BBC Radio 1.\n\nFinding fans at opposite ends of the dance music spectrum is nothing new for the Dusky duo. Previously existing as progressive/ melodic house entity Solarity, Dusky are London based musicians Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman. As comfortable writing elegant orchestral pieces or stirring piano motifs as they are jackin' garage house and epic techno grooves, their diverse sounds are united by the duo's singular aim -- to compose electronic music with depth, soul and originality.\n\nInfluenced by everything from classical and jazz to techno, UK bass and avant-garde electronica, their compositions have been supported by DJs as diverse as Dubfire, Sasha, Vincenzo, Shur-I-Khan, Motorcitysoul and Above & Beyond.\n\nOne of 2011's most exciting debut albums, \"Stick By This\" looks set to extend their appeal further yet.", "title": "Dusky - If Only", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T12:20:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjU_-Q6RrkM", "description": "It's my kids in a box.", "title": "Rolling Smugness", "publishedDate": "2010-11-23T13:03:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjUnVOkOC04", "description": "Ancestral Maqui Drink es un bebida especial para deportistas de alto rendimiento, con resultados espectaculares en los mejores clubes deportivos del pa\u00eds.\nCompra, visita y aprende de Maqui en www.ancestralmaqui.com", "title": "Emiliano Vecchio & Ancestral Maqui Drink", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T22:58:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjUpe7Oh1j0", "description": "Everybody has played Duck Hunt for NES.

Taurus likes stability. It's an earth sign. In astrology it means that that sign needs security and wants to lead a life of familiarity in a sense, something that is, when I say familiar, something that works well, and if it works well once then Taurus wants to continue doing that. Sagittarius on the other hand is a fire sign and it is the sign in astrology that represents freedom. Sagittarius is looking for adventure and getting out and experiencing the world. The first thing that Taurus tries to do with a Sagittarian to whom he or she is very drawn because, like a moth to a flame, the Taurus is very interested in the Sagittarian's free spirit. But, the first thing the Taurus will try to do is to curb that free spirit. So, Sagittarius immediately tries to get out of the net. \n\nAs a business partnership, they might be a little better because Sagittarius is willing to try new ideas and Taurus is a very good business person. As a love affair, once the sexual sparks die down, and they do very quickly because what Sagittarius is looking for in sex is fun and what a Taurus is looking for is a deeply passionate experience that will last and last and last. Once that dies down, then they have so little in common that it is difficult to sustain a long lasting affair, much less a marriage.

For an example, the blue light (wavelengths around 460 nm) has a direct impact on the suppression of melatonin secretion. The intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) are highly sensitive to blue light. In this case, the blue light inhibits the ipRGC, which blocks the secretion of melatonin. On another hand, the opposite side of the visible light spectrum, the red light (wavelengths around 640 nm) is detected by the cones but is invisible to the ipRGC. And so these cells become active and permit the melatonin secretion, just as if it was night-time or total darkness. \n\nMany studies support the restorative function of sleep, demonstrating that a good sleep-wake cycle enhances the immunological activity and the tissue healing. Moreover, it has been shown widely that patients have sleep disturbances when hospitalized in intensive care units. Night interventions affect their sleep quality and quantity. Even though these interventions are almost essentials, we need to think about a method to help the sleep of these patients.\n\n\"Colour Outside the Lines: A Reverse Innovation Challenge for Canadian Health Systems\" is an open challenge to inspire current and future leaders to become active participants in shaping the transformation of our health care system.

Today it is a square named Sultanahmet Meydani in the Turkish city of Istanbul, with only a few fragments of the original structure surviving.\n\n\n\nThe word hippodrome comes from the Greek hippos ('\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), horse, and dromos (\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), path or way. Horse racing and chariot racing were popular pastimes in the ancient world and hippodromes were common features of Greek cities in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine eras.\n\nHistory and use\n\n\nAlthough the Hippodrome is usually associated with Constantinople's days of glory as an imperial capital, it actually predates that era. The first Hippdrome was built when the city was called Byzantium (Byzantion in Greek), and was a provincial town of moderate importance. In 203 the Emperor Septimius Severus rebuilt the city and expanded its walls, endowing it with a hippodrome, an arena for chariot races and other entertainments.\n\n\n\nIn 324, the Emperor Constantine the Great decided to move the seat of the government from Rome to Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma (New Rome). This name failed to impress and the city soon became known as Constantinople, the City of Constantine. Constantine greatly enlarged the city, and one of his major undertakings was the renovation of the Hippodrome. It is estimated that the Hippodrome of Constantine was about 150 metres long and 130 metres wide. Its stands were capable of holding 100,000 spectators.\n\nThe race-track at the Hippodrome was U-shaped, and the Emperor's box, with four bronze statues of horses on its roof, was located at the eastern end of the track. These horses, which were cast in the 5th century BC and brought from Greece, were looted during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and installed on the fa\u00e7ade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. The track was lined with other bronze statues of famous horses and chariot drivers, none of which survive.\n\nThroughout the Byzantine period, the Hippodrome was the centre of the city's social life. Huge amounts were bet on chariot races, and the whole city was divided between fans of the Blue (Venetii) and Green (Prasinoi) chariot racing teams. The two other racing teams, the Reds (Rousioi) and the Whites (Leukoi), gradually weakened and were absorbed by the two major factions. Frequently rivalry between Blues and Greens became mingled with political or religious factions, and riots which sometimes amounted to civil wars broke out in the city between them. The most severe of these was the Nika riots of 532, in which 30 000 people were said to have been killed.\n\nConstantinople never really recovered from its sack during the Fourth Crusade and even though the Byzantine Empire survived until 1453, the Hippodrome was not rebuilt and did not regain its former glory. The Ottoman Turks, who captured the city in 1453 and made it the capital of the Ottoman Empire, were not interested in racing and the Hippodrome was gradually forgotten, although the site was never actually built over.", "title": "Byzantine Empire Hippodrome of Constantinople - Sultanahmet", "publishedDate": "2008-04-23T18:30:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "AjsL1XV7yZg", "description": "A listener asks: Is my sublease in jeopardy if the tenant I sublease from defaults on their lease?\n\n\"Ask Michael Bull\" is a commercial real estate FAQ video series featuring a new video posted each business day.

The assembly of the kit is straightforward, some filler was needed to fill some gaps between the lower and upper hull.\nI used two new techniques on this model - preshading and mud spray. I never tried a preshading on a tank model before, the effect is very sublte and i don\u00b4t know whether i try it again at some point or not. I made the mud splashes this way: I mixed MIG pigments and liquid pigment fixer together, dipped a brush and splashed it on the model using the air blast of an airbrush. I definately overdid it, but it was funny so i couldn\u00b4t stop! Now it is a very muddy vehicle, but it looks cool in my opinion.\n\nI painted the model with acrylic paints from Revell.\n\nThe Centauro is a wheeled tank destroyer designed for light to medium territorial defense and tactical reconnaissance. It was developed by a consortium of manufacturers, the Societ\u00e0 Consortile Iveco Fiat - Oto Melara (CIO). Iveco Fiat was tasked with developing the hull and propulsion systems while Oto Melara was responsible for developing the turrets and weapon systems.\n\nThe vehicle was developed in response to an Italian Army requirement for a tank destroyer with the firepower of the old Leopard 1 main battle tank then in service with the Italian Army but with greater strategic mobility. The main mission of the Centauro is to protect other lighter elements of the cavalry, using its good power-to-weight ratio, excellent range and cross country ability (despite the wheeled design) and computerized fire control system to accomplish this mission. Centauro entered production in 1991 and deliveries were complete by 2006.\n\nCentauro was deployed in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, where the design proved successful. Centauro was usually employed to escort motor convoys, for wide area control and for road patrols. Centauros were also deployed during operation Antica Babilonia, the Italian involvement in the Iraq War. During this operation, a Centauro troop took part in the battle for the bridges of Nassiriya, destroying a building where snipers were hiding. It is currently deployed as part of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nI don\u00b4t own the rights for the music in ths video.\nMusic: \"Hamburg Invasion\" from the game \"Modern Warfare 3\"", "title": "Trumpeter B1 Centauro \"early Version\" in 1/35 scale", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T11:23:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ak3f6Nfqwac", "description": "como fazer um Ch\u00e1 caseiro muito Bom Para a GRIPE.\n\nEntre no nosso site:\n\nwww.wtvcriciuma.webnode.com.br\n\nNot\u00edcias \nEntretenimento\nReportagens\nBastidores\nFlagrantes\n\nwww.wtvcriciuma.webnode.com.br", "title": "Ch\u00e1 Caseiro bom para A GRIPE", "publishedDate": "2010-01-14T16:49:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ak3p7zW9mDc", "description": "What you see here is one of two strike fly fans for the astronomical clock. Since this will strike on the quarters, we need two trains to accomplish this as with any conventional quarter striking clock; one train for the hours and one for the quarters. Therefore two flies are needed. What you see here is the quarter strike fly being tested by manually turning the quarter strike train. This is based on Charles Fasoldt's design for a remontoire fly fan in one of two astronomical tower clocks built in 1872. We have enhanced his design by having the pinion that drives the long detent 'whip' driven from an internally toothed wheel rather than a conventional toothed wheel. This changes the geometry of the whip to trace its outline from an epicycloid to a hypocycloid configuration. You can graphically see this in last month's installment of the construction project here: www.my-time-machines.net\n\n\nWhat we are trying to accomplish here is the illusion that the fly whip will crash into one or both of the adjacent winding arbors. We also think the epicyclical movement of the fly assembly as a whole tends to grab the viewer making one's head bob or rotate to catch the movement. This is but one of many individual visual elements that will attract, hold and, hopefully, mesmerize the viewer making that viewer think \"well, now just how did he do that?\"", "title": "Astro_12-10_vid5.mpg", "publishedDate": "2011-01-04T03:24:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ak4AGMh4yMI", "description": "Helic\u00f3ptero de resgate pousa na pra\u00e7a Trafalgar Square em Londres, para resgatar infartado idoso.

An increase in Open Interest means that there is an increase in contracts for that particular stock or ETF, which means that there is more money flowing into that market. An increase in implied Volatility means that the market is stating that there is an increased chance that price will move further from its current location.\n\nIf Open Interest is increasing and Implied Volatility is decreasing, it implies that the current trend may level off. An increase in Open Interest means that there is still an increase in contracts for that particular stock or ETF, which means that there is more money flowing into the market. However, the decrease in implied Volatility means that the market is stating that there the chance of price moving further is decreasing.\n\nIf Open Interest is decreasing and Implied Volatility is decreasing, it implies that the current trend may halt or reverse. The decrease in Open Interest means that the number of outstanding contracts is going down from traders closing out of their positions, and the decrease in implied Volatility means that the market is stating that the chance of price moving further is decreasing.\n\nLet's look at using open interest if the price of the stock or ETF is in a range.\n\nAs price moves toward the edge of the range, if Open Interest is increasing and Implied Volatility is increasing, it implies that price may break out of the range. An increase in Open Interest means that there is an increase in contracts for that particular stock or ETF, which means that there is more money flowing into the market. An increase in implied Volatility means that the market is stating that there is an increased chance that price will move further from its current location.\n\nIf price is nearing the top or the bottom part of the range, and Open Interest is starting to decrease, it suggests that price may bounce off the wall of the range and reverse as this shows that traders are closing out of their current positions. If Implied Volatility is also decreasing, this helps confirm the possibility that price will bounce off the walls of the range and reverse.\n\nSo that is using Option Open Interest and Implied Volatility as sentiment indicators.

The Irish held off a late rally and Conor Kelly made a huge save in the final seconds to seal the win.  Matt Kavanagh was named Tournament MVP.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\n\n[FULL VIDEO TITLE] \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Notre Dame vs Syracuse | 2014 ACC Men's Lacrosse Championship Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T20:40:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "Al1CkKWfi4E", "description": "When determining a treatment plan for pondweeds, it's important to identify the types of weeds that are present.

The Gr\u00e9vy's zebra is found in Kenya and Ethiopia.[2] Compared with other zebras, it is tall, has large ears, and its stripes are narrower. It is more ass-like in appearance as compared to other zebras, which are more horse-like.\n\nThe Gr\u00e9vy's zebra lives in semi-arid grasslands where it feeds on grasses, legumes, and browse; it can survive up to five days without water. It differs from the other zebra species in that it does not live in harems and has few long-lasting social bonds. Male territoriality and mother--foal relationships form the basis of the social system of the Gr\u00e9vy's zebra. This zebra is considered to be endangered.

Gebruik hiervoor een fijn penseel zoals in dit geval het Eyelinerpenseel.\n- Als finishing touch gebruikt de visagist de Mascara Maximum Volume. Deze mascara geeft je wimpers maximaal volume.\n- Maak met de mascaraborstel een zigzaggende beweging zodat de wimpers mooi van elkaar worden gescheiden.\n- (tussenshot)\n- TIP van de visagist: de Durable Cream Eyeshadow kan ook perfect als basis voor elke oogschaduw worden gebruikt, in dit geval voor de Eyeshadow Moondust, maar probeer het ook eens met elke andere oogschaduw uit het Make-up Studio assortiment.\n- De visagist maakt het Verpoetspenseel licht vochtig en brengt hiermee de Eyeshadow Moondust Bright Sky aan de buitenkant van het oog aan, over de Durable Cream Eyeshadow heen.

Use a small brush like the Eyeliner Brush which is used in this video.\n- For a finishing touch the make-up artist applies the Mascara Maximum Volume. This mascara gives your lashes maximum volume. By moving the brush from left to right the lashes are beautifully separated.\n- (tussenshot)\n- Make-up artist TIP: the Durable Cream Eyeshadow can also be used under each type of eyeshadow from the Make-up Studio range.

So, on Thursday, May 12th, he headed to Larson Chevrolet to trade almost even for this beastly Chevy Biscayne. John thought, rightfully so, that Chevrolet\u2019s L72 427 could be a lot of fun in the blue collar brand\u2019s most blue collar offering, and he spent much of the next year enjoying his new toy at local drag strips. In June of 1967, when John headed to Vietnam to defend our freedom, the Biscayne found its second owner in 20 year old Leroy Levens. Still wet behind the ears, Levens threw a few go fast pieces on the car and promptly blew its original engine. Luckily, a service replacement block was located and Levens, honing his racing skills on both the road and track, eventually blistered the strip with a best time of 12.69 @ 106MPH. As the years passed, Levens continued to back the car out of the garage for sunny day joyrides and, eventually, coordinated a frame-off restoration which included a roster of NOS components. In 1986, sporting fresh Tuxedo Black lacquer, the Bisquick caught the eye of New Jersey resident Joseph Fasano. And, after 24 months of negotiations, Fasano purchased the car and promptly detailed it to factory-correct guise using many dated components. The next 25 years included a lot of time on the trailer, many award-winning appearances at Super Chevy shows and a couple hundred miles of careful road time. And, circa 2013, the car was purchased by its current, Ohio-based owner who spent $7,000 and 300 hours freshening its original sheetmetal and smooth lacquer paint.\n\nPop this sedan\u2019s wide hood and you\u2019ll find a fully detailed, date-correct 427 which is branded with a familiar 3869942 casting number. Introduced as the ultimate option for street-prowling bowties, Chevrolet\u2019s storied L72 big block spins stout 11 to 1 compression into an as advertised 425 horsepower. At the top of the all-business mill, an NOS dual-snorkel air cleaner funnels wind through a correct Holley 3246 carburetor. That carb rides on a correct Winters intake, which hangs between correct, cast iron heads that benefit from 3-angle valve jobs. Those heads sit on a .030-bored block that\u2019s fitted with stock pistons and a correct L72 solid lifter cam. At the back of that cam, correct but deactivated transistor ignition shoots spark through date-coded Packard TV R Suppression cables. Below those cables, correct exhaust manifolds jettison baked Sinclair into a big, true-dual exhaust system. In front of those manifolds, GM-coded belts spin a correct alternator above an NOS fan clutch and idler pulley. And, at the front of the engine, an original, L72 Biscayne-exclusive radiator is fitted with a correct shroud, a correct finger guard, GM-branded hoses and old school tower clamps. \n\nBehind that engine, an era-correct Muncie feeds a familiar GM 12-bolt, which spins a posi-traction differential around big, 4.56 gears. Under that capable drivetrain, a completely rebuilt F41 sports suspension is equipped with manual steering and 4-wheel drum brakes. And at the corners of that suspension, great looking G78-14 Goodyear Power Streak IIs frame painted steelies and red-detailed hub caps. \n\nDecked in correct red hides, this sedan\u2019s stunning interior has been returned to factory-fresh condition in virtually every way. The wide bench seats feel newer than their NOS covers suggest, and present just as well now as the day they rolled out of the dealership. In front of those seats, a restored dash, which features a rare, 7,000RPM tachometer, carries what appears to be a correct radio. At the base of that dash, a stylish chrome shifter rows around an NOS boot and baseplate. And in front of the driver, a color-keyed steering wheel spins around a classy blue bowtie. \n\nOne of the most potent machines of the mid \u201860s, this Biscayne is an ideal combination of subdued looks and sheer power.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Asian man eating ALIVE octopus for dinner in Korea!!!

Y de las 19, este proyecto pol\u00edtico incorpor\u00f3 13, lo cual habla muy claro de su voluntad de cuidar a la gente\u201d, agreg\u00f3.Iniciada el pasado 1 de septiembre, la campa\u00f1a se extender\u00e1 hasta el 31 de octubre en todos los vacunatorios y hospitales del pa\u00eds, y supone la colocaci\u00f3n de dos vacunas: la doble viral contra el sarampi\u00f3n y la rub\u00e9ola -que es inyectable- y la Sabin oral contra la poliomielitis, que se administra en forma de gotitas por boca.Deben vacunarse todos los chicos de 1 a 4 a\u00f1os inclusive, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que tengan las vacunas al d\u00eda.\u201cNosotros no tenemos polio desde 1984, no tenemos sarampi\u00f3n desde el 2000 y no tenemos rub\u00e9ola desde el 2009; pero en otros pa\u00edses del mundo estas enfermedades est\u00e1n presentes, generan contagios y fallecimientos, por eso lo que tenemos que hacer es cubrir a los ni\u00f1os con una dosis extra, independientemente de que tengan su esquema de vacunaci\u00f3n completo, deben recibirlas\u201d, agreg\u00f3 Vizzotti.La funcionaria explic\u00f3 que, adem\u00e1s de gratuita, la vacunaci\u00f3n es obligatoria \u201cporque es una estrategia de salud p\u00fablica para seguir libres de estas enfermedades\u201d, es un derecho \u201cque tienen todos los ni\u00f1os de estar protegidos\u201d y es una obligaci\u00f3n \u201cporque si ellos no se enferman, no transmiten a otros que son m\u00e1s vulnerables\u201d.Y en este sentido, la especialista hizo hincapi\u00e9 en el componente de solidaridad que encierra el acto de vacunarse \"porque se benefician no s\u00f3lo los que se vacunan sino tambi\u00e9n otros grupos que no reciben la vacuna, como los menores de 1 a\u00f1o que a\u00fan no recibieron la triple viral (sarampi\u00f3n, rub\u00e9ola y paperas), los inmunocomprometidos, y las embarazadas que no se pueden vacunar con virus vivo y atenuado\u201d.Junto a Manzur y Vizzotti estuvieron tambi\u00e9n el ministro de salud bonaerense, Alejandro Collia y el intendente de Quilmes, Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez; quienes destacaron, adem\u00e1s, la notable reducci\u00f3n de la mortalidad infantil experimentada por Argentina que, seg\u00fan un informe de Unicef divulgado ayer, descendi\u00f3 un 53 por ciento en las \u00faltimas dos d\u00e9cadas.Es que, entre otras cosas, la mejora de este indicador se explica por la amplitud del calendario nacional de vacunaci\u00f3n.\u201cEs muy grato porque son cifras de la ONU quien destaca el descenso brutal que tuvo aqu\u00ed la mortalidad infantil, liderando los pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n y al tope en el ranking mundial\u201d, dijo Manzur.Por su parte, Collia apunt\u00f3 que la provincia de Buenos Aires \u201choy tiene el nivel de mortalidad infantil m\u00e1s bajo de su historia. Este indicador expresa el bienestar del individuo, que tiene que ver con la escolaridad, con el trabajo y las fuertes pol\u00edticas sociales, pero tambi\u00e9n con todas las acciones sanitarias, como es el caso de haber pasado de tener 6 vacunas en el 2005 a las actuales 19\".\u201cNosotros, con apoyo de la Naci\u00f3n, hemos logrado el 100 por ciento de vacunaci\u00f3n de 1 a 4 a\u00f1os y eso nos permiti\u00f3 bajar la mortalidad infantil, contrarrestando esta campa\u00f1a difamatoria que habla de altos \u00edndices de pobreza, de desocupaci\u00f3n, de falta de desarrollo.

The object of the game is to collect the most stars while feeding candy to Om Nom, the cute and hungry monster character from the app.\n\nTo begin, each player gets two score cards. Deal out six challenge cards facedown to form a draw pile to the side of the playing area. To play, turn over the top card in the pile. For each round, each player takes turns setting up the scene shown on the card using the game pieces. You can point the launcher in any direction as long as the notched end is in the same position as the candy piece shown on the card. There are three notches on the launcher where you can place the candy piece. Use any of the three notches based on how fast and how far you want the candy to go. To release the candy, \"cut\" the rope by pushing down on the top of the launcher. You get four \"cuts\" to feed Om Nom and knock down as many stars as possible. To get points, you must knock over stars (Each star knocked over counts for one star on the score card.) and feed Om Nom by shooting the candy piece into Om Nom's base and closing Om Nom's mouth. After six cards, the player with the most stars wins.\n\nIf you hit any of the obstacles\u2014spider, spike strips, and bubble\u2014it can affect your turn. Hitting the spider makes you lose one of your four cuts. Hitting a spike strip means your turn is over and you don't get a score. Hitting the bubble allows you to set up a better shot.\n\nThe game comes with one Om Nom, a candy game piece, a candy launcher, a spider with spider card, a bubble with bubble card, two spike strips with spike cards, three gold stars, four score cards, and 22 challenge cards.

Michelle Dewberry would - the Apprentice winner explains why she is going through with procedure now she's 35\n\nSince turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze her eggs.\nThe TV star, who shot to fame after winning Alan Sugar's approval on the BBC reality show has made the tough decision after reaching her mid-thirties without finding The One. \nBut the choice also centres around Michelle's successful career in business, which she believes would face a setback if she took time out right now to have children.  \n\n\nShe made the revelation after Google and Apple's announcement this week that they would be providing financial support to female employees who wanted to freeze their eggs. \nMichelle said: 'We live in this society now where it used to be that women stayed at home, the chap was the breadwinner, but times have now changed because we have a choice.\n'Lots of women want to stay at home, but I\u2019m in a position now where I want to focus on my career. \n\n\n'I believe that I can achieve anything that I want in the workplace and the one thing that is restricting me is my biological clock\n'It\u2019s a mixture of three things, I have an awful lot that I want to achieve in my career, I haven\u2019t met the right guy yet that I want to settle down with and also I feel like I\u2019m just not ready.'\nAnd the career woman is quick to dismiss any speculation that women who feel like this are lacking in maternal instinct. \n\n\nShe told This Morning earlier today: 'I absolutely want to be a mum.\n'When I think my future, it absolutely involves family - family means the world to me, but I\u2019m just not ready to be a mum.\n'What I want is the choice.' \nNow in her mid-thirties, Michelle and her friends have reached a common age where conversation on nights out inevitably turns to one thing - motherhood. \nShe said: 'I turned 35 a couple of days ago and the topic of who is going to have kids, when we\u2019re going to have kids -  there are so many cocktails that (my friends and I) have drunk while discussing that topic. \n'You go round and round and it drives you mad.\n'I don\u2019t want that pressure in my life. I don\u2019t want to meet a guy in a bar and instead of getting to know him, be trying to find out whether he wants kids, when he\u2019d want them and his intentions for the future.' \nSo Michelle is hoping that by freezing her eggs, she will manage to both alleviate the time pressures on her body clock, but also achieve all of her career ambitions before she finally settles down to have a family.  \nShe said: 'I want to be a mum when I am still young enough to enjoy the kids, ideally for me it would be early forties.\n'As a woman it\u2019s really hard to decide when is the right time and who is the right person - freezing your eggs is almost an insurance policy.\n\n\n'But hopefully life will move on and nature will take it\u2019s course and I\u2019ll meet someone who is awesome, settle down with them, have a family and probably not even use these eggs.'\nMichelle believes that for these reasons, Apple and Google are right to offer to cover the procedure costs of up to \u00a312,600 when it comes to freezing eggs. \nShe said: 'There are so many people saying that they just want to control you as an employee, that\u2019s ridiculous, this company asked what is important to their employees and this is what they came up with.\n'Let\u2019s get all of this in balance, Apple do all of those other things like childcare already.\n'They provide adoption support, enhanced maternity leave, this is a package of benefits, it\u2019s not an isolated package on its own. \n'But obviously anything has side effects and the thing people need to do is do their research. \n'People need to truly understand what it means, how it will affect you and how your life can revolve around that as well.\n'We need to put this into perspective, not every woman is going to down tools tomorrow and go freeze their eggs, and I don\u2019t think any company is suggesting that is what they should do, it\u2019s just giving them a choice.'", "title": "Michelle Dewberry Explains Decision To Freeze Her Eggs", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T15:47:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmEVXm2sqh4", "description": "O PdH Sessions \u00e9 um projeto do PapodeHomem, no qual convidamos m\u00fasicos para sess\u00f5es leves, relaxadas, em locais inusitados.\n\nPara esta edi\u00e7\u00e3o, chamamos o Mustache & os Apaches.\n\nBanda: Mustache e os Apaches\nhttp://soundcloud.com/mustacheeosapaches\nhttp://mustacheeosapaches.blogspot.com.br/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Mustache-e-os-Apaches/208046112550309\nhttps://twitter.com/mustacheapaches\n\nAnfitri\u00e3o:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/santamaloca?fref=ts\n\nNo PapodeHomem:\nhttp://papodehomem.com.br/mustache-e-os-apaches-pdh-sessions-1/\n\nConcep\u00e7\u00e3o: Papo de Homem\nVideomaker: Luiza de Castro\nDiretor, Produtor e T\u00e9cnico de Som: Luciano Ribeiro\nMaking Of e Fotos: Felipe Larozza\nAnfitri\u00e3o: Hostel Santa Maloca", "title": "\"Twang\" - Mustache e os Apaches | PdH Sessions #1", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T17:14:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmEkg3exfv8", "description": "[Official] Subscribe to Channel Here: http://tiny.cc/YTubeSubscribe | Produced By KMC & Optimus Productions\n\nSubscribe to Channel Here: http://tiny.cc/YTubeSubscribe\nJoin Mailing List Here For New 2015 Music & Events: http://tiny.cc/bqmdyw\n\nhttp://Julianspromos.com\nJulianspromos@gmail.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JulianspromosFanPage (Like)\nhttp://www.facebook.com/julianspromos (Personal Page)\nhttp://instagram.com/Julianspromos| @Julianspromos\nhttp://twitter.com/Julianspromos | @Julianspromos\n\nWe advertise events, concerts, parties, music & more..\nView our Featured Advertised Events: http://tiny.cc/FeaturedEvents\n\n'Denise Belfon\" \"Night Nurse\" \"Knockout Riddim\" \"Soca Music \"Soca Music \"Soca Music\" \"2015 Soca\" \"2015 Soca\" \"2015 Soca\" \"Official\" \"Official\" \"Official\" \"Official\" \"Official\" \"Official\" \"2015 Trinidad Carnival\" \"Julianspromos\" \"JulianspromosTV\" #2015Soca #SocaMusic #2015TrinidadCarnival #TrinidadCarnival #Soca \"Soca Music\" 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015 Soca 2015", "title": "Denise Belfon - Night Nurse (Knockout Riddim) \"2015 Trinidad Soca\"", "publishedDate": "2014-11-02T22:59:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmF0Q1_9_zw", "description": "Carya in Antalya's Belek region is the first classic, heathland style golf course to be built on Turkey's Mediterranean coast.

Common precancerous skin growths.  Please visit our site for more information about dermatological conditions. \n\nKey Points\n*Consist of small pink areas of skin which are rough or scaly\n*Caused by chronic accumulative sun exposure\n*Considered a pre-cancerous condition\n\nActinic keratosis, also known as solar keratosis, is a precancerous condition related to damage from chronic sun exposure. Affected persons develop small pink or red lesions which are rough or scaly, usually appearing on parts of the body which are not typically covered by clothing. In some cases, squamous cell carcinoma develops within these lesions, which is the rationale for their preventative removal.  Any part of the body with consistent sun exposure, most commonly the face,  scalp, ears, neck, arms and top of hands, may be affected . Actinic keratoses are usually 1 centimeter or less in diameter, generally slightly scaly (with occasional instances of lesions which become thick with scale, as with warts), and with a pink, red or brown color variation.\n\nActinic keratoses most commonly affect fair-skinned persons, those who have trouble tanning (in other words, burn easily), those with light-colored (blue, green, hazel) eyes, and those with red or blond hair. Any person with excessive sun exposure, especially during their youth, is at greater risk.   In addition, persons with weakened immune systems due to HIV, chemotherapy or organ transplant have a greater risk of developing actinic keratoses and skin cancers.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis (Other conditions with similar appearance)\nSquamous cell carcinoma\nBowen's disease (squamous  cell carcinoma in situ, a very thin noninvasive type of squamous cell carcinoma)\nBasal cell carcinoma\nSeborrheic keratosis\nWart\nBenign Lichenoid keratosis\n\nDiagnosis\nKey Points\n*Diagnosis based on appearance and location\n*Skin biopsy may be performed to rule out malignancy\n\nActinic keratosis is generally diagnosed based on appearance of the affected area. Health care professionals may biopsy the affected area to exclude malignancy.\n\n*Prevention is the most important factor in combating the disorder\n*All occurrences should be treated, as the disorder has the potential to become malignant\n*Several treatments exist to destroy the pre-cancerous growths.  Most commonly cryosurgery (destruction by freezing with liquid nitrogen), 5-fluorouracil topically, Imiquimod cream topically, Photodynamic therapy, and chemical peel are all options to treat AK's.\n*Self-examination is key in the timely recognitiont of actinic keratoses\n\nPrevention of actinic keratosis by moderating direct sun exposure is recommended. Prevention of sun exposure has been shown to reduce the occurrence of new lesions. Covering the skin with appropriate clothing during times of sun exposure, using sunscreen with a high Sun protection factor (\"SPF\") of 30 or more, seeking shade during prolonged outdoor activities (or planning outdoor activities during the morning or evening hours), and even wearing clothing with an UPF rating can assist in prevention.\n\nIf an affected area begins to change quickly or bleed, attention from a medical professional is recommended. Several options are available to treat or destroy the affected tissue, including the use of creams (fluorouracil, diclofenac, Imiquimod), cryosurgery, curettage (scraping), dermabrasion, chemical peeling, or laser treatments. Photodynamic therapy has also been shown to help in affected persons.", "title": "Actinic Keratosis:  Diagnosis and Overview - OnlineDermClinic", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T21:41:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmUAFZLO7Xk", "description": "", "title": "The Difference Between REM Sleep And NREM", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T12:52:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmUMa30VXLs", "description": "Outworld Devourer gets out of the world for few seconds.\nThis video was made possible by a user submission.

Prudential Texas Realty \n\nHow to Spot a Termite... Termite Video What is a Termite? \n\nTermites are a group of eusocial insects that, until recently, were classified at the taxonomic rank of order Isoptera (see taxonomy below), but are now accepted as the epifamily Termitoidae, of the cockroach order Blattodea. While termites are commonly known, especially in Australia, as \"white ants,\" they are only distantly related to the ants.\n\nLike ants, some bees, and wasps\u2014which are all placed in the separate order Hymenoptera\u2014termites divide labour among castes, produce overlapping generations and take care of young collectively. \n\nTermites mostly feed on dead plant material, generally in the form of wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung, and about 10 percent of the estimated 4,000 species (about 2,600 taxonomically known) are economically significant as pests that can cause serious structural damage to buildings, crops or plantation forests. Termites are major detritivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions, and their recycling of wood and other plant matter is of considerable ecological importance.\n\nAs eusocial insects, termites live in colonies that, at maturity, number from several hundred to several million individuals. Colonies use decentralised, self-organised systems of activity guided by swarm intelligence which exploit food sources and environments unavailable to any single insect acting alone. A typical colony contains nymphs (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals of both sexes, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens.\n\nHow to Spot a Termite", "title": "Termite - How to Spot a Termite - What is a Termite?", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T20:37:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "AmlBWfRIfdU", "description": "\u2207OPEN ME \u2207\n\n\u2764 Hope you like it ! \u2764  (\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\n\nWhat Song do you want in nightcore?\nWrites it in the comments!\u2764\n\n[\u25cf] ARTIST: Mindless Self Indulgence\n[\u25cf] SONG: Prescription\n[\u25cf] GENRE: NIGHTCORE\n\n[\u25ba] PICTURE:\nhttp://s393.photobucket.com/user/andzuha/media/gumiwitch_render_by_airumidai_zps6512fa0b.png.html\n\u266b~nightcored by me~\u266b\n\n~Video and Remix by myself~\n\nWhat Song do you want in nightcore?\nWrites it in the comments!\u2764\n\n\u2764Lyrics:\u2207\n Doctor\n Patient\n\nI'm the doctor, I'm the patient\nDon't forget that, it's important\nIf ya love me, like I love me\nEverybody will be sorry\n\nWell I don't need nothin' before the show\nI don't need nothin', well that's not so\nI need something before the show\nJust a little something to make me GOOOOO\n\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nGive me more [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\nGive me more [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\n\nI don't need no one screwin' up my fun\nOver the counter, fill that prescription\nI don't need no one screwin' up my fun\nOver the counter, fill that prescription\n\nI'm the doctor, I'm the patient\nDon't forget that, it's important\nIf ya love me, like I love me\nEverybody will be sorry\n\nWell I don't need nothin' before the show\nI don't need nothin', well that's not so\nI need something before the show\nJust a little something to make me GOOOOO\n\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nGive me more [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\nGive me more [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\n\nI don't need no one screwin' up my fun\nOver the counter, fill that prescription\nI don't need no one screwin' up my fun\nOver the counter, fill that prescription\nI don't need no one screwin' up my fun\nTurn down the bass and fill that prescription\n\n(DoDoDaDoDoDoo)\n(AaAaAaAaAaaAa)\n(DoDoDaDoDoDoo)\n(AaAaAaAaAaaAa)\n\nI don't need nothin' before the show\nI don't need nothin', no that's not so\nI don't need nothin' before the show\nI don't need nothin', noooo that's not so\nI don't need nothin' before the show\nI don't need nothin' but that's not so\nI neeeed something before the show\nJust a little something to make me GOOOOO\n\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nWow Woah Ohh\nYa kna-kna-know what I want?\nMake it stop [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\nMake it stop [x2]\nPretty please - a prescription\n\n\n\u2207READ PLEASE:\u2207\n\nI do not own the original song or the pic I just want to share this great music with the world :3\n\n\nFair Use:\u2207\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

A la llegada de la primavera empieza a emitir las hojas y en verano el tallo floral. Al final del verano y principios del oto\u00f1o, \u00e9ste se suelta y, gracias al viento, se desplaza rodando por los campos desprendiendo y dispersando las semillas. De ah\u00ed el nombre de corredor.\n\nSobre sus ra\u00edces crece la seta de cardo (Pleorotus eryngii), comestible y muy apreciada por los seteros.
