In November 1964 Liza Minnelli was not yet 20 and not yet a Broadway success. She looks it: the coltish, appealingly gawky girl is still pretty raw (at one point after a costume change she yanks off her earrings just before launching into a song), and Garland seems alternately proud of and bemused by her. The video is pretty raw, too, a rough black-and-white affair that can best be described as serviceable in quality. However, fans of this brand of showbiz razzmatazz will be satisfied with the duets between the women (especially trading verses on a medley of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" and \"Get Happy\"). Judy opens the show with the reliable chest sweller \"Once in a Lifetime\" (no relation to the Talking Heads tune) and delivers a tutorial in song dynamics with \"The Man That Got Away.\" She appears rather shrunken and tired but still comes on like a trouper, fending off the audience's constant heckling for \"Over the Rainbow\" (as though she might forget it?) before finally handing the song back to them as a touching sing-along. This was Garland's last appearance at the Palladium. It's also a passing of the torch to Liza, who would later become the kind of polished dynamo embodied by her mother, more than capable of holding down her own one-woman shows.", "title": "Liza Minnelli & Judy Garland - Hello Dolly (live)", "publishedDate": "2008-06-10T13:21:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Q3bqt2pSxY", "description": "A robotic device that helps paralyzed patients stand and walk has won approval from federal regulators.

Talia wore black on Valentine's Day to help bring awareness to childhood cancer. In Talia's memory and for all the children that lost their battle and those that are still fighting, we ask you to join us in wearing black on Valentines Day to support childhood cancer awareness.  \n\nTalia was asked if she had one wish, what would it be, Talia said \"a cure to childhood cancer\".\n\nPlease help Talia's Legacy to find a cure to childhood cancer by sending in a picture of you, your pet, your organization/club, group of friends, family, or co-workers and make a donation to help find a cure.  We will show your support by putting these pictures on our social media sights for millions of people to see.  \n\nWe're also happy to share that Talia's Legacy has formed a national collaboration with the American Childhood Cancer Organization that will give them a much wider reach than the local organization BaseCamp, which is under the umbrella of ACCO. BaseCamp is one of the 40 local affiliate organizations across the country that provides direct services to the families in their communities.\n\nAmerican Childhood Cancer Organization's mission is to address the needs of families through programs that emphasize information, advocacy, awareness, and research.\nTalia's Legacy has very similar objectives that include raising national awareness to the prevalence of childhood cancer. The foundation will also be raising funds for research and clinical trials for childhood cancer drugs; they will assist families and children battling cancer with fundraisers through programs and events.\n\nTo learn more about ACCO visit their website at http://www.acco.org\n\nSpecial thanks to LeaCakesMUA for editing and loading this video:  http://www.youtube.com/user/LeaCakesMUA", "title": "Big Announcement!

Every new generation constituted a milestone with which ALPINE defined new standards for particle size analysis. Today, the ALPINE air jet sieve is the most-used device around the world for determining the particle size distributions of dry powders and is employed in just about every industry. Many companies throughout the world stipulate ALPINE's air jet sieve in their factory standards as standard test equipment. Numerous national and international standards also mandate the air jet sieve for testing certain products. Its strong market position stems from the wide performance range at simultaneously high-quality results: it always delivers (at identical underpressure and sieving duration) exactly reproducible particle size analyses in the range 10 \u03bcm to 4000 \u03bcm. \n\nWith the Alpine Air Jet Sieve e200LS, Hosokawa Alpine has succeeded yet again in setting a new benchmark in terms of functionality and quality. For the very first time, the unit has an integrated mini-computer which controls, regulates and monitors the sieving process. Optimised sieving times and reduced peripherals save the operator time, and automatic checks and default settings increase the quality of the results. The ergonomic design is functional and yet elegant at the same time. A touch screen permits simple and intuitive operation.\nwww.luftstrahlsieb.de\nwww.airjetsieve.com", "title": "Hosokawa Alpine Air Jet Sieve e200 LS - Principle of Operation", "publishedDate": "2012-07-25T11:53:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QCMF2KFaQo", "description": "Die Spielleut Ranunculus live auf dem Zunftmarkt in Bad Wimpfen 2010.\n\nhttp://www.spielleut-ranunculus.de\nAuf Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Spielleut-Ranunculus/349331391752074", "title": "Spielleut Ranunculus 2010 Zunftmarkt Bad Wimpfen \"Gavotten\"", "publishedDate": "2012-03-18T01:24:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QCvVrdEgrc", "description": "Video of a cargo stowage test performed at Cordstrap Cargo Securing Training Center.

Tiere von mehr als 2 Metern L\u00e4nge sind ausgesprochen selten.\n\nMerkmale: Welse haben einen flachen Kopf mit einem breiten Maul, dieses wird auch als \u201euners\u00e4ttlicher Rachen\" beschrieben. Im Oberkiefer reihen sich einige Zahnreihen aneinander, die mit kleinen messerscharfen Z\u00e4hnchen besetzt sind. Die Richtung der Z\u00e4hnchen weist in den Schlund. Au\u00dferdem sitzen zwei lange Bartf\u00e4den am Oberkiefer sowie vier k\u00fcrzere Barteln am Unterkiefer. Mit den langen Barteln tasten Welse nach Beute. Die Afterflosse ist lang und geht bis zur Schwanzflosse. Die F\u00e4rbung reicht von blauschwarz bis dunkelolivgr\u00fcn, zus\u00e4tzlich noch marmoriert. Der riesige Fisch nimmt h\u00e4ufig zwecks Tarnung die Farbe des Untergrundes an. Die Flanken sind heller, die Bauchseite ist hell gef\u00e4rbt. Das Maximalalter liegt bei 80 Jahren.\n\nVerbreitung: Der Wels kommt in ganz Europa vor, au\u00dfer in Nordskandinavien. Sein Lebensraum sind schlammige Seen und langsam flie\u00dfende Fl\u00fcsse.\n\nGef\u00e4hrdung und Schutzstatus: Silurus glanis ist nicht gef\u00e4hrdet, im Nationalpark Donau-Auen kommt er zum Beispiel im Regelsbrunner Seitenarm sehr h\u00e4ufig und wohlgen\u00e4hrt vor!\n\nLebensweise: Welse sind mehrheitlich nachtaktiv, lediglich bei tr\u00fcbem Wasser sind sie tagaktiv und gehen auf die Jagd. T\u00e4glich am Morgen kehren sie zielsicher an ihren Schlafplatz zur\u00fcck. Wo es vom Untergrund her m\u00f6glich ist, erw\u00fchlen sie sich regelrechte H\u00f6hlensysteme, in denen sie den Tag verbringen. Silurus glanis ern\u00e4hrt sich vor allem von Fischen, aber auch von W\u00fcrmern, Krebsen, Fr\u00f6schen, sowie mit zunehmendem Alter auch von am Wasser lebenden V\u00f6geln, Ratten und im Extremfall auch badenden Hunden. Generell betrachtet er alles Tierische das sich anbietet, z.B. auch Aas und allerlei Tiere die dem Hochwasser zum Opfer gefallen sind, als Nahrung. In Welsm\u00e4gen hat man auch schon Menschenteile gefunden, diese stammten jedoch von Ertrunkenen. Gro\u00dfe Waller benutzen ihre Barteln auch als Lockmittel f\u00fcr Fische. Es werden W\u00fcrmer imitiert, so holen sie sich das Fressen regelrecht vor das Maul. Etwas r\u00e4tselhaft ist das Verbleiben des Welses im Winter. Fallen die Temperaturen des Wassers unter vier bis sieben Grad Celsius, verlassen sie n\u00e4mlich ihre Schlafst\u00e4tten, verschwinden in den Tiefen der Gew\u00e4sser und halten Winterruhe. \u00dcber dieses unheimliche Lebewesen existieren viele Legenden, denn wo der Waller wohnt, k\u00f6nnen ihm die Menschen nicht folgen. Wenn der Wels nicht will, dass man ihn sieht, besteht keine Chance. Auch ist nicht bekannt, ob Welse gut oder schlecht sehen.\nZur Fortpflanzung im Juni bauen die M\u00e4nnchen ein Nest mit weichem Pflanzenmaterial, wo das Weibchen nach einem st\u00fcrmischen Vorspiel und der nachfolgenden Paarung \u00fcber 1,2 Millionen Eier ablegt, sie werden vom M\u00e4nnchen bis zum Schl\u00fcpfen der Brut bewacht. Die kaulquappen\u00e4hnlichen Larven schl\u00fcpfen nach zwei bis drei Tagen. Zus\u00e4tzlich trachtet das M\u00e4nnchen, dass das Gelege mit genug Frischwasser versorgt ist, indem er es bef\u00e4chelt. Welse erzeugen auch Laute, sie \u201estridulieren\": Dabei reiben sie zwei Knochenpl\u00e4ttchen gegeneinander, es entsteht ein kr\u00e4chzendes Ger\u00e4usch.\n\nBesonderes: Versuche haben gezeigt, dass die Temperatur des Gew\u00e4ssers eine wesentliche Rolle f\u00fcr seinen Appetit spielt. Bei Temperaturen von 5 Grad Celsius dauert es 200 Stunden, bis eine ausgiebige Mahlzeit verdaut ist, bei 25 Grad Celsius dauert es nur ein Zehntel davon.\n\nRegie: Franz Hafner", "title": "Wels, Waller im Nationalpark Donau-Auen - Silurus glanis", "publishedDate": "2012-02-04T15:15:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QLMvOLA-q0", "description": "TIPP f\u00fcr Katzen-/Gartenliebhaber: Teucrium marum (Katzengamander)", "title": "Gizmo 2014 03 08 Katzengamander", "publishedDate": "2014-03-08T15:15:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QLUsPoKL4A", "description": "Video's made of parts of the Wonderwall movie", "title": "Remo Four - In The First Place", "publishedDate": "2009-06-29T09:46:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QLdrX9kvDI", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehowfitness\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ehowfitness\n\nGluteus minimus stretching exercises are a very common movement in the world of Yoga.

According to Dr. Pete Teel, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station entomologist, ticks can cause illnesses like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Lyme disease, and now a new disease.\nSOUND BITE - Dr. Pete Teel \nHuman ehrlichiosis of which there are two types in the United States. One, we call human monocytic ehrolichiosis and the other is human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.\n\nVOICE OVER\nTeel said Texans are more likely to be exposed to the HME type disease.\n\nSOUND BITE - Dr. Pete Teel \nThe organism cycles normally between the Lone Star tick, which we call the vector, and its vertebrate host, which is the white-tailed deer, so, the cycle is normally from tick to deer and then back again, but when humans or dogs, cats for that matter, get exposed to ticks, humans in this case can become infected with the organism that causes the human disease.\n\nVOICE OVER\nTeel recommended to minimize skin exposure by wearing pants, light color clothes and tick repellents. He also suggested what he called tape up.\n\nSOUND BITE - Dr. Pete Teel \nTake some masking tape, stretch it out lengthwise and folding it lengthwise, so you have two sticky sides, wrap that around your pant leg on top of your boot and shrinks that area of exposure, so they can't crawl up your boots onto your skin.\n\nVOICE OVER\nAnd for pets, Teel said to use the many effective tick treatments now available. He indicated that it is recommended to do a tick check when pets are exposed to the outdoors. And if ticks are found on the skin, there is a proper tick removal procedure that everyone should follow to avoid skin inflammation and some infections.\n\nSOUND BITE - Dr. Pete Teel \nUse the finger nails, get right down to the head, grab hold of the tick, slowly pull straight; don't twist and don't jerk.\n\nVOICE OVER\nAvoid putting alcohol or other solvents to make the tick detach itself. Teel said adding solvents would only increase the tick's salivation process and the risk of contracting a disease.\n\nFrom College Station, I'm Norma Moreno.\n\nSUGGESTED TAG: Teel said humans infected by a tick may experience flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, body aches, joint pain and in more severe cases, nausea, vomiting and disorientation.", "title": "Officials Warning Texans to Watch Out For Tick-Borne Diseases", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T21:29:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QN3JvKEH6w", "description": "IBN RUSHD O COMO LO LLAMAN LOS ESPANOLES AVERROES...UN GRAN MUSULMAN, CIENTIFICO Y FILOSOFO QUE SACO A LOS EUROPEOS DE LA IGNORANCIA HACIA EL CONOCIMIENTO.....OCCIDENTE AGRADECIO TODO ESTO MASACRANDO LOS MUSULMANES DE ANDALUCIA...NUNCA LO OLVIDAREMOS!!\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes", "title": "ANDALUCIA MUSULMANA.flv", "publishedDate": "2010-10-05T21:07:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QN6eil-9SA", "description": "Video Cam Direct Upload", "title": "Re: Subtitle Version Dan Hannan", "publishedDate": "2009-03-31T18:15:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QNIewj8VO4", "description": "Suscr\u00edbete aqu\u00ed http://bit.ly/YGN7Ni", "title": "Loci\u00f3n blanqueadora de perejil para la piel", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T11:48:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QNUiOPoGoA", "description": "The soundtrack from the major cyberpunk action-adventure prequel 'Deus Ex: Human Revolution' in high definition quality.\n\nSet in a dystopic 2027, you are Adam Jensen, a security officer who gets heavily augmented against his will, after his employer, Sarif Industries, gets attacked by ruthless terrorists that injure him almost deadly.

The song pays homage to Seagrams and Tanqueray gin.  A top 10 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at number eight, \"Gin And Juice\" was nominated for the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance.  It was voted the 69th Greatest Rap song as ranked in rap.about.com and number eight on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.  \"Gin And Juice\" was produced by Dr. Dre and performed by Snoop Dogg with David Ruffin Jr.  The hook was written by Dr. Dre and David Ruffin Jr., which contained an interpolation of Slave's \"Watching You\" and an original bassline created by T. Green.  Additional vocalists on the song include Dat Nigga Daz, Jewell, Heney Loc, and Sean 'Barney' Thomas.  Cordazar Calvin Broadus (born October 20, 1971), better known by his stage name Snoop Dogg, is a Grammy Award-nominated American rapper, record producer, and actor.  Snoop is best known as an MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of producer Dr. Dre's most notable prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.  He popularized the catch phrase suffix '-izzle', a slang term or infix that had been in use for decades, but not nearly to the extent that it currently permeates the pop and hip hop music industry as well as general usage.  Snoop Dogg was a Crip gang member while in high school, and shortly after graduation, he was arrested for cocaine possession and sentenced to three years in prison, then began his music career in 1992 after his release.  He collaborated with Dr. Dre on several tracks on Dre's solo debut \"The Chronic\" and on the titular theme song to the film \"Deep Cover\".  Snoop's debut album, \"Doggystyle\", was released in 1993 under Death Row Records.  \"Doggystyle\" went quadruple platinum on the strength of several hit singles like \"Who Am I (What's My Name?)\" and \"Gin And Juice\".

(I think I managed to avoid any typos this time!)\n\nThis came about as the result of a challenge from my sister to write a song to help memorize the periodic table. Though Tom Lehrer's version is famous, it doesn't include some of the more recently named elements, and (more importantly) it doesn't present them in order.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFIvXV...\n\nI highly recommend the TMBG song \"The Elements\" as a helpful reminder of what the elements are, and also as an example of a really excellent learning song, both educationally and musically.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy0m7j...\n\nIf you are using this song/video to memorize the periodic table, take advantage of a number of mnemonic devices I built in. All of the \"noble\" gases except for helium are labeled as such in the song... That means you know you're on the right hand side of the table. This should help you line things up if you are unsure.\n\nTry to memorize one chunk at a time, or even one line at a time.

Allegro in B flat major\n\nThis performance of one of the most challenging scores in the violin repertory, Paganini's 24 Caprices, played by the internationally celebrated violinist, Alexander Markov, recorded in Reggio Emilia, Italy. It combines intense passion with extraordinary technical ability. Director Bruno Monsaingeon, himself a concert violinist, first heard Markov during a recital in New York entirely devoted to the Caprices and was left utterly dumbfounded. He says of that concert, \"the technical difficulties, as if naturally overcome, had been replaced by an incandescent musical imagination which made the Paganini Caprices a thrilling experience, far removed from the school-masterly and cautious approach of most violinists.\" Sir Yehudi Menuhin says \"Alexander Markov will certainly leave his mark on the music-lovers of the world and in the annals of the violin virtuosi of our day. He is without doubt, one of the most brilliant and musical of violinists.\" Mstislav Rostropovich says: \"Once I managed to hear his performance of the 24 Paganini Caprices on TV I am certain that he is one of the most interesting young violinists of his generation in the entire world.\"", "title": "Paganini - Caprice no.13, Alexander Markov, violin [HD]", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T04:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Qf0lRgknio", "description": "My First Project", "title": "Pericardial Window", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T19:17:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Qf8afQwLLs", "description": "attractie 3", "title": "breughel losser", "publishedDate": "2007-08-18T11:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QfkCYSU0SU", "description": "HODGY BEATS - KARATEMAN Featuring LEFT BRAIN\n\nMELLOWHYPE\n\nDirected by Rob Haffey & Etienne Maurice\nCinematogrphy by Mike Koziel\nCreative Director: Hodgy Beats", "title": "HODGY BEATS - KARATEMAN Featuring LEFT BRAIN", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T18:01:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Qg-qh-Nps8", "description": "An Ivory Gull at Patrington Haven east Yorkshire December 2013.", "title": "Ivory Gull HD (Pagophila eburnea) Feeding On Fish", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T13:16:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Qg2AhdcmfE", "description": "Mikemanlyman shooting the Howdah Hunter 20 gauge, double barreled, black powder pistol, March, 2010.", "title": "Howdah Hunter 20 gauge, black powder pistol.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-03-08T02:20:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QgIJOy7T7Y", "description": "How to make platonic solids with gum drops and tooth picks.

Their duties include overseeing company resources, regulatory compliance, and workplace operations in a broad sense. If they are found negligent in the execution of their duties, they as individuals and your company as a legal entity could be held liable for costly damages and might be subject to government or regulatory investigation.\n\nAt DiNicola Insurance Services, we offer Directors and Officers insurance\u2014often called D&O insurance\u2014to protect your company and its leaders in case of accusations that they failed in their oversight or fiduciary duties. D&O insurance can pay legal fees, financial settlements, damages, and some civil penalties if those are assessed. It may also cover investigative costs, depending on the policy.\n\nOur professionals stay abreast of the latest trends in D&O risks for both privately held and public companies. Since Directors & Officers insurance can be complicated, it's critical that you have an insurance professional help you find the right policy\u2014whether that is protection for individual directors and officers (Side A coverage), indemnification of directors and officers by the company (Side B), or coverage for the company itself (Side C).

Saturnia la regina delle terme-La Simed Centri di Medicina estetica, cosmetica e rigenerativa ha eletto le Terme di Saturnia il migliore centro termale del mondo. Questo \u00e8 solo uno dei tanti riconoscimenti ricevuti da Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf, il Resort nato intorno alla famosa sorgente di vita e benessere Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf.\nLa CNN l'ha eletta il migliore centro termale del mondo. \u00c8 solo l'ultimo dei tanti premi vinti da Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf, il Resort nato intorno alla famosa sorgente di vita e benessere Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf, un legame che si evolve rimanendo sempre fedele a se stesso.Il Mito narra che Saturno, dio delle messi e dell'abbondanza, un giorno perse la pazienza nel vedere che sulla terra gli uomini erano costantemente impegnati a farsi la guerra. Allora prese un fulmine e lo scagli\u00f2 con forza. La saetta cadde nel cratere di un vulcano, dal quale zampill\u00f2 un fiume d'acqua sulfurea e calda che si rivers\u00f2 per valli, monti e pianure, avvolgendo uomini e cose ed acquietando finalmente gli animi. La Storia di Saturnia, secondo alcune fonti la pi\u00f9 antica citt\u00e0 italica, parla invece di una florida localit\u00e0 frequentata da Etruschi, Romani, e poi nel Medioevo dai fiorentini del Granducato di Cosimo II. Fino agli inizi del XX secolo, quando Gaspero Ciacci comp\u00ec il passo decisivo per la valorizzazione delle acque di Saturnia costruendo il primo hotel e commissionando all'Universit\u00e0 di Pisa le prime analisi chimiche scientificamente complete delle sue acque.Il presente di Saturnia \u00e8 infine costantemente proiettato al futuro, e all'eccellenza. Come riconosce anche la CNN, la famosa emittente televisiva statunitense che ha eletto le Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf Resort il migliore centro termale al mondo in cui rilassare corpo e mente.Dopo essere stata riconosciuta da Lonely Planet tra le prime 10 migliori sorgenti termali benefiche in Europa e da Fodor's - il pi\u00f9 grande editore al mondo di guide turistiche scritte esclusivamente in lingua inglese - tra le migliori Spa termali d'Europa, Terme di Saturnia \u00e8 dunque entrata ancora una volta nelle prestigiose classifiche mondiali, distinguendosi per i suoi trattamenti di bellezza che fanno uso di oro, diamanti e ghiaccio antartico, per i trattamenti medicali e per la sua sorgente termale che presenta poteri curativi. Situato nel cuore della Maremma toscana, ai piedi del Borgo medievale di Saturnia, in provincia di Grosseto, tra i due promontori di Piombino e dell'Argentario, Terme di Saturnia Spa & Golf Resort propone ai suoi ospiti un modello di rigenerazione psico-fisica naturale (Your Natural Reset) che, ruotando intorno alle straordinarie propriet\u00e0 medicali, antiossidanti e anti-aging della purissima acqua termale sorgiva che da oltre 3000 anni sgorga nel cratere naturale al centro del resort (alla temperatura costante di 37,5\u00b0 con un flusso di 500 litri al secondo, per un ricambio completo ogni 4 ore per 6 volte al giorno), combina in modo sinergico interventi e discipline diversi, in un'atmosfera magica e rilassante.Fiore all'occhiello del Resort, il campo da golf di Terme di Saturnia situato a poschi metri di distanza dall'hotel. Un percorso da campionato 18 buche, par 72, di 6316 metri \u00e8 stato progettato dall'architetto Ronald Fream, del noto studio californiano Golfplan, che dal 1972 \u00e8 autore/ideatore di alcuni tra i pi\u00f9 prestigiosi campi da golf del mondo. Ricco di mount, ostacoli d'acqua e di sabbia e di green larghi e profondi, il campo da Golf si sviluppa nel verde della valle di Saturnia con i suoi paesaggi mozzafiato. Il campo da Golf di Terme di Saturnia offre al golfista un percorso di alta qualit\u00e0 senza affliggerlo con faticosi dislivelli altimetrici e colpi proibitivi. Le buche propongono colpi interessanti e scenografici sia ai giocatori di buon livello che ai pro, grazie alla presenza di diversi tees ben distanziati tra loro. Questo consente al percorso di soddisfare i giocatori pi\u00f9 esigenti e di ospitare gare ai massimi livelli. All'interno di un cratere naturale sgorga alla temperatura, sempre costante, di 37 \u00b0C, identica a quella del liquido amniotico. Il continuo ricambio gli permette di mantenere intatte le sue caratteristiche chimico-fisiche, gli effetti biologici e terapeutici, le condizioni igienico-sanitarie, senza bisogno di alcuna manipolazione esterna. Sono queste le virt\u00f9 dell'acqua di Saturnia, da 3000 anni un dono di vita per l'umanit\u00e0.", "title": "Terme di Saturnia Spa&Golf-Toscana-Benefici Relax-Con le acque curative-Hotel-Centri Termali-Italia", "publishedDate": "2014-05-12T13:10:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5QqRUR0W5lk", "description": "Paderborner Jungs.

They are related to the sharks and rays, and are sometimes called ghost sharks, ratfish (not to be confused with the rattails), or rabbitfishes.\n\nChimaeras live in temperate ocean floors at up to 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) depth. They have elongated, soft bodies, with a bulky head and a single gill-opening. They grow up to 150 centimetres (4.9 ft) in adult body length, although some also have a lengthy tail. In many species, the snout is modified into an elongated sensory organ.\n\nLike other members of the class Chondrichthyes, chimaeras have a skeleton constructed of cartilage. Their skin is smooth and lacks scales, and their color can range from black to brownish gray. For defense, most chimaeras have a venomous spine located in front of the dorsal fin.\n\nChimaeras resemble sharks in some ways: they employ claspers for internal fertilization of females and they lay eggs with leathery cases. However, unlike sharks, male chimaeras also have retractable sexual appendages on the forehead and in front of the pelvic fins. They lay eggs in spindle-shaped leathery cases.\n\nThey also differ from sharks in that their upper jaws are fused with their skulls and they have separate anal and urogenital openings. They lack the many sharp and replaceable teeth of sharks, having instead just three pairs of large permanent grinding tooth plates.", "title": "Chimaera.", "publishedDate": "2009-01-24T03:40:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5R90HLRCKa8", "description": "Voor u uw Fagus sylvatica-haag gaat aanplanten, is het verstandig wortels en loof te knippen.

Let's fight for our survival!\nA greater force will naturally win.\nThe hunger ghost showed us his fast arrival\nand in the sky his terrible, fell wing.\n\nWeed's wife:\nYou are now right. The storm comes after silence.\nFor our great sin we must pay very soon\nbecause the God sees everything by science.\nWe cannot think at all since we feel swoon.\n\nWeed:\nThe ground now leads us in the death by hunger.\nUnhappily we took this foreign field\nbecause we were uneducated, younger\nby taking here the might we could not wield.\n\nWeed's wife:\nThe culture fed the ground and us with reaping\nas nourishment. The field was grateful then.\nOur garbage is too bad without life keeping \nand brings all death, not only illness span. \n\nWeed:\nOur great mistakes were dull and very scary.\nAnd our souls soon leave bodies without choice.\nOur motherland brought hard loads we could carry\nwith our own songs and sometimes happy voice.\n\nWeed's wife:\nThe foreign field invited, took us vainly.\nAt home we could grow modestly but long.\nAnd death pain comes into the world now mainly.\nBlind mercies bring the whole life the end song.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPoet, Songwriter, & Performer:\nLeo Himmelsohn", "title": "Weed_Culture4Epilogue-Leo_Himmelsohn-Dialogue_Verse_Song-Rhythmic_Declamation-Sprechgesang.avi", "publishedDate": "2011-10-13T22:11:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5REBS2-n958", "description": "", "title": "What Are The Treatments For Neonatal Hydronephrosis?", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T01:54:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5REGZ3p02PE", "description": "Narrow Block House Designs\n\n\n\n\n\nnarrow band uvb\nwall letters decor\ninterior decorator maryland\nhouse decorating\ndecorations for girls rooms\nnarrow band\ndecorative led lights\nnarrow block homes designs\ndecorative interior door\nnarrow bathroom\nnarrow block house designs perth\nnarrow block house designs brisbane\nnarrow bench press\nNarrowLotHomeDesign.com.au - Best Designers For Narrow Block Home Designs \nhome decorating catalog\nnarrow block house designs\ninterior decorating stores\nnarrow bike trail\nnarrow block house designs gold coast\nnarrow bridge\ndecorating little girls room ideas\nfind an interior decorator\ninterior design and decoration 6th edition\nnarrow boats for sale uk\ninterior decoration courses in pune\nnarrow block house designs sydney\nnarrow block house designs melbourne\nnarrowboat afloat series\nnarrow block house designs newcastle\nnarrow block house designs 7m\ninterior decorating photography\nparty decorations for kids\ninterior decorating firms\nliving room home decor\ngossip girl room decor\nnarrow boats\ntoddler room decor\ninterior decorators\nEtosha Display Home in East Ballina, Low Maintenance and Narrow Block Design \ninterior decoration ideas for living room\nThe Brescia 2 Storey Narrow Lot Home Design - Your Building Broker Perth \nnarrow block homes designs perth\ninterior decorator salary", "title": "Narrow Block House Designs", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T17:55:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5REbX2MLzZo", "description": "Judicial Watch has forced the IRS to court on July 10, 2014 to explain the missing Lois Lerner emails.", "title": "Judicial Watch: IRS Has Misled Courts \"They Are in Real Trouble\"", "publishedDate": "2014-06-29T01:33:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5REsGZQGEZ4", "description": "Processus de fabrication des prot\u00e9ines par la cellule eucaryote.

The quest to rehabilitate \"Kahuna\" has sparked an unlikely partnership between Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, FL, and the Equine Hyperbaric Center of South Florida at Reid and Associates in Loxahatchee, FL, who will play host to the sea turtle during regular treatments for over two weeks (view a video from the treatment here). The partnership arose after an employee of the Equine Hyperbaric Center of South Florida at Reid and Associates paid a guest visit to LMC. Although the agency routinely works with horses, the sea turtle's condition struck a chord. \n     Kahuna is a female 183.15-pound adult Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) that first arrived at LMC on August 22, 2010 after being found near Hutchinson Island, FL. Her injuries were consistent with that of a shark attack, with approximately 60% of her left front flipper missing and several deep lacerations on her right front flipper. The turtle also had labored breathing possibly from aspirating sea water. \n     After nine months of rehabilitation treatment at LMC including daily nebulizations, antibiotics, vitamins, good nutritional support, and surgery to repair her right front flipper, the turtle's future is still uncertain. Unresolved bone infection (osteomyelitis) is present in both front flippers, causing the turtle to become unstable without antibiotics. Working closely with Dr. Mettee, Palm Beach Equestrian Center will loan the use of their Hyperbaric Chamber to Kahuna in an effort to clear the turtle's bone infection using Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.\n     The Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) defines Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy as a treatment in which a patient breathes 100% oxygen intermittently while inside a treatment chamber at a pressure higher than sea level pressure. The UHMS says it can be viewed as the new application of an old, established technology to help resolve certain recalcitrant, expensive, or otherwise hopeless medical problems. Although the reason behind its success is not widely understood, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has been used to treat bone infection in humans and other animals. Mettee is optimistic it will also be effective when used on the sea turtle. \n     The following indications are approved uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as defined by the UHMS Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Committee: Air or Gas Embolism; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning (Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Complicated by Cyanide Poisoning); Clostridial Myositis and Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene); Crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischemias; Decompression sickness; Arterial Insufficiencies (Central Retinal Artery Occlusion, Enhancement of Healing in Selected Problem Wounds); Severe Anemia; Intracranial Abscess; Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections; Osteomyelitis (Refractory); Delayed Radiation Injury (Soft Tissue and Bony Necrosis); Compromised Grafts and Flaps; and Acute Thermal Burn Injury. \n     If you would like to adopt Kahuna in an effort to offset the costs associated with her rehabilitation, please visit marinelife.org/adopt. Sea turtle adoptions start at $35 and include personalized certificates, photographs, and sea turtle information.", "title": "View of \"Kahuna\" inside the hyperbaric chamber at Equine Hyperbaric Center of South Florida", "publishedDate": "2011-06-03T20:21:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "5RQIh7tKYSA", "description": "", "title": "Bus load of hoes", "publishedDate": "2011-07-01T23:56:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5RQLtazgXKo", "description": "", "title": "Kennesaw State University Enrollment - Culinary", "publishedDate": "2013-03-07T09:42:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5RQlVZbYPrk", "description": "Copyright 2012 Salar Niknafs, courtesy of the University of Wollongong.

Each zebra has a unique pattern.\nIn the bushes we find many antelope species, which share this area together with the zebras.

The 1832 Edinburgh Encyclopedia proves the Athabascan People or Dene People including the Apache, Chipewyan, and Navajo are Algonquin. The third link is to a page with a list of tribes speaking Algonquin. The fourth link is to a googlebooks pdf book written by Andrew Blackbird in 1887, titled History of the Ottawa and Chippewas Indians of Michigan. Blackbird wrote that Chippewas or Anishinabe, was extensively spoken among the Shoshone which means the Shoshone are Chippewas. It is on pages 89 and 90. The fifth link is to a webpage about the Macro-Algonquian Languages. The Chippewas or Anishinabe Language, was spoken from the Arctic Ocean to Florida, and from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nhttp://www.wabanaki.com/seven_fires_prophecy.htm\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=QLVkuSgdGi8C&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=strongbow+indian+tribe+and+chipewyan&source=bl&ots=KweSF3b9ab&sig=mYq_GzjL5xWRQYztic6J_a6TCB8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hsvfUs_oKsaAogSMp4CwBQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=strongbow%20indian%20tribe%20and%20chipewyan&f=false\n\nhttp://www.wilkesweb.us/algonquin/nations.htm\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Ottawa_and_Chippewa_India.html?id=bX8CAAAAYAAJ\n\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/355350/Macro-Algonquian-languages", "title": "North Lodge Pole, Montana", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T12:15:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5RWUcc7z47M", "description": "The 42nd in a new series from RAF Recruitment -- Paul's feeling upbeat as he gears up for a night patrol.

When larvae consume nicotine-replete plants, their midgut-expressed cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) is upregulated. The larvae in which CYP6B46 is silenced by plant-mediated RNAi excrete more of their ingested nicotine. Silencing CYP6B46 impairs the mechanisms of passing ingested nicotine from the midgut to the hemolymph to be exhaled from the spiracles during spider attack. Spiders are deterred by this nicotine-rich halitosis. Thus, the CYP6B46-silenced larvae exhale less nicotine and become ready spider prey, demonstrating that CYP6B46 functions to repurpose the normally excreted nicotine for defense.\n\nAbstract\nManduca sexta (Ms) larvae are known to efficiently excrete ingested nicotine when feeding on their nicotine-producing native hostplant, Nicotiana attenuata. Here we describe how ingested nicotine is co-opted for larval defense by a unique mechanism. Plant-mediated RNAi was used to silence a midgut-expressed, nicotine-induced cytochrome P450 6B46 (CYP6B46) in larvae consuming transgenic N. attenuata plants producing MsCYP6B46 dsRNA. These and transgenic nicotine-deficient plants were planted into native habitats to study the phenotypes of larvae feeding on these plants and the behavior of their predators. The attack-behavior of a native wolf spider (Camptocosa parallela), a major nocturnal predator, provided the key to understanding MsCYP6B46's function: spiders clearly preferred CYP6B46-silenced larvae, just as they had preferred larvae fed nicotine-deficient plants. MsCYP6B46 redirects a small amount (0.65%) of ingested nicotine from the midgut into hemolymph, from which nicotine is exhaled through the spiracles as an antispider signal. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were more susceptible to spider-attack because they exhaled less nicotine because of lower hemolymph nicotine concentrations. CYP6B46-silenced larvae were impaired in distributing ingested nicotine from midgut to hemolymph, but not in the clearing of hemolymph nicotine or in the exhalation of nicotine from hemolymph. MsCYP6B46 could be a component of a previously hypothesized pump that converts nicotine to a short-lived, transportable, metabolite. Other predators, big-eyed bugs, and antlion larvae were insensitive to this defense. Thus, chemical defenses, too toxic to sequester, can be repurposed for defensive functions through respiration as a form of defensive halitosis, and predators can assist the functional elucidation of herbivore genes.", "title": "Tobacco hornworm found to use nicotine to create 'defensive halitosis' (s2)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-01T17:34:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5R_2W7VyhzU", "description": "January 16, 2012\nGirls Basketball Half-time Performance", "title": "Gustavus Adolphus College Dance Team", "publishedDate": "2012-01-23T02:03:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "5R_2fvXMb8E", "description": "En 2012, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, alors candidat \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidentielle, affirmait : \"Oui, je mettrai fin \u00e0 l'exclusion du don de sang, parce que chaque pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement est contr\u00f4l\u00e9 d'abord, et parce qu'il est d\u00e9vastateur \u00e0 tous les niveaux d'accr\u00e9diter une forme de pr\u00e9somption de s\u00e9ropositivit\u00e9 des hommes homosexuels.

JEFFERSON COUNTY, Colo. \u2014 An armed carjacking suspect went on a crime spree around Lookout Mountain Wednesday afternoon, much of which was captured on video by SkyFOX.\n\nThe suspect was captured in dramatic fashion by a law enforcement officer in the middle of I-70 as traffic came to a halt. A civilian got out of his car and helped the deputy hold the suspect down on the highway until more help arrived.\n\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office says motorcycle deputy Fred Haggett was the lone officer who tackled the armed suspect on the freeway. His brave moves made sure the dangerous actions ended without anyone getting hurt.\n\nThere was a second suspect, a female, who was captured earlier without incident.\n\nThe crime spree left several crime scenes for sheriff\u2019s deputies and state troopers to investigate. Westbound I-70 was closed and traffic was backed up for miles during the investigation.\n\nThere were a total of four vehicles involved \u2014 either carjacked or attempted carjackings.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened:\n\n    It began at 2:40 p.m. when the man fled from a traffic stop on Cabrini Road\n    At 3:15, he and his passenger are accused of carjacking two victims from a Subaru at gunpoint near Lookout Mountain Park\n    Next, he\u2019s accused of breaking into a home near Centennial Trail and stealing a truck while the homeowner hid\n    He crashed it a short time later at Cherry Coke\n    Witnesses say they heard gunfire after the crash\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t over.\n\nSkyFOX was flying and first spotted a man and woman who looked like they were hiking on Lookout Mountain just after 4 p.m. It turns out both were desperately trying to avoid police. They were carjacking suspects, armed, dangerous and on the run.\n\nThey allegedly targeted tourists on Lookout Mountain.\n\nThe man eventually left his friend behind. He was clearly armed with a handgun and an assault rifle. He hoped to escape when he came across some parked snowplows. He opened the driver\u2019s side door and climbed into two of them, but he gave up on that idea.\n\nIt was about that time that the female suspect realized she didn\u2019t have a chance. She slid down a hill and surrendered peacefully to an officer.\n\nNot too far away, the male suspect is still searching for a way to get away. He tries to steal a truck from outside a home. The door was unlocked but the keys weren\u2019t there. He then breaks into the house.\n\nRemember \u2026 all of this is on the video from SkyFOX posted with this story.\n\nThen things really get crazy. Moments after entering the house, the suspect blasts through the closed garage door in an SUV he had stolen. He took off and ended up on some dirt mountain roads near I-70 where the SUV appears to get stuck. He ditched the vehicle and went looking for his next escape route.\n\nHis hope was to steal a car from someone on the Interstate. He started pointing his gun and one driver almost stopped. But fortunately that driver realized the danger and sped away.\n\nIt looked like the suspect would have another chance, but that\u2019s when deputy Haggett arrived. The deputy chased him around a stopped vehicle in the middle of the westbound lanes, grabbed him by the shirt, pulled him in and slammed him down on the pavement. A motorist got out of his car and helped Haggett pin the suspect to the ground until more deputies arrived.", "title": "Colorado Carjacking Video Terrorist with Gun VIDEO Carjacker Terrorizing Colorado Highway", "publishedDate": "2014-07-24T11:17:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Rae5GIRcvk", "description": "http://www.undergroundworldnews.com\nFILAMENT ERUPTION, POSSIBLY EARTH-DIRECTED: For days, amateur astronomers around the world have been monitoring an enormous filament of dark plasma snaking across the face of the sun.

Know your reason WHY you set these goals\n2.) Set mini goals at a time, and work on things little by little\n3.) Make a list, write down steps you have to take to get there, things you have to do or change that will help you move closer to your goals.\n4.) Visualize yourself as already having reached your goals.  Picture it in your mind, how will you feel?\n5.) Reward yourself for reaching your goals.  Clothes shopping?  A day of pampering yourself?

The challenging ideas, mind-thumping humor, and bristly passion of Thoreau are realized in the scholarship and artfulness of Radaker.

Fred then takes a stroll into the small intestine where Fred is sucked into and absorbed by the wall. Pablowito (aka the blood) takes Fred to his new home at the cell or as we lovingly call it, Scottsville.  If Pablowito has too much or too little water (hypotonic and isotonic solutions) he will not be able to taxi the Freds to Scottsville. He enters through the front gate (cell membrane) Once Fred is inside Scottsville he goes to work in the cytoplasm where glycolysis rips him in half. He makes 2 dollars for this process and he makes some energy which is swept up by the custodian. He becomes Dave and Nancy (Or as mrs. Ackerson calls them pyruvic acids). Dave and Nancy enter the Kreb's cycle. In this cycle Dave and Nancy make a little bit of energy as instructed by the boss (nucleus). This energy is swept up by the custodian (NADH and FADH2) and will be used later. They also make two dollars for their hard labor (ATP). Then the custodian drops off the energy at the hydrogen power plant (ETC) inside the mitochondria. Here it is used to pump hydrogen ions out of the plant (through the ion channel). It then moseys (diffuses) back on in. Between the moseying gates there are power lines (carrier proteins) to transport all of the energy throughout the powerplant. That's where all the dough is made. Lots of energy is produced to be dispersed throughout the cell (community). This is where the company makes thirty two dollars to be divided up into Scottsville.

Het gaat hier heel erg goed en daarom hebben we met het oog op de toekomst gekozen voor een nieuwe merknaam\u201d, aldus De Wilde. \n\n\u2018\u2018Voor de rebranding gaan we de tijd nemen. De licentie voor het merk \u2018Kuoni\u2019 eindigt pas volgend jaar. Vanaf eind augustus gaan we in de loop van een jaar langzaamaan rebranden van Kuoni naar Tenzing Travel. Het eerste half jaar zullen we gaan werken met een transitie-logo waarop staat \u2018Kuoni wordt Tenzing Travel\u2019 dat we overal zullen gebruiken. De eerste maanden richten we ons vooral op alles intern en op de reisbureaus en vanaf december gaan we ons ook op de B2C richten. Vanaf het moment dat de gidsen voor het seizoen 2015-2016 uitkomen zal de naam Kuoni helemaal zijn verdwenen.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cDe naam \u2018Tenzing\u2019 komt van Tenzing Norgay, de Nepalese gids en sherpa van Edmund Hillary, de Nieuw-Zeelander die als de top van de Mount Everest bereikte in 1953. Wij vinden het belangrijk dat er een mooi verhaal achter de merknaam zit. Zonder Tenzing had Hillary nooit de top bereikt, want Tenzing heeft de reis voorbereid, kende de route en heeft Hillary geholpen om problemen te overwinnen. Wij hebben ons daardoor laten inspireren en gezegd: wij willen de Tenzing, de gids zijn voor onze klanten.\u201d.\n\n\u2018\u2018Met dit nieuwe merk kunnen we naar de toekomst toe veel meer. Wij willen de meest toonaangevende reisorganisatie zijn op het gebied van verre reizen. Dat betekent niet dat wij de grootste willen zijn. Ik heb het over kennis, innovatie, kwaliteit en klanttevredenheid. Als je kijkt naar de offerte tool die we hebben, de reisdocumenten, wat we doen op het gebied van kennis- en conceptontwikkeling zijn we goed bezig. Wanneer mensen vragen naar een goede reisorganisatie voor verre reizen dan moet Tenzing Travel worden genoemd. Ik wil een goede, kwalitatieve verre reizen organisatie zijn die stabiel, winstgevend en toonaangevend is en ook gericht is op continu\u00efteit...en waar zowel de medewerkers, de reisbureaus als de klanten elk op hun eigen manier toch wel een beetje trots op zijn\u2019\u2019, aldus De Wilde. \n\nDe Wilde is niet van plan iets aan de strategie te veranderen, maar laat weten versneld verder te  gaan met een aantal pijlers binnen de strategie. De Wilde: \u201cWij werden nog teveel gezien als een generalist, terwijl wij concurreren met specialisten. Met Tenzing Travel willen we meer specialisme uitstralen per bestemming en daarom krijgt iedere bestemming ook een eigen label (Tenzing Travel America, Tenzing Travel Africa, Tenzing Travel Asia, Tenzing Travel Down Under, Tenzing Travel Caribbean en Tenzing Travel Latin America) met een eigen kleur, een eigen Business Unit waar alle kennis zit en een eigen website (met een eigen kleurstelling en eigen look & feel).

In a season that tightened and heightened the brand's head-to-toe uniform, Nasir collaborated with Skepta for a bespoke soundtrack that boomed as his designs two-stepped beyond the catwalk and straight into its spiritual home, the club. Riding the grime great's flow as part of the Red Bull Catwalk Studio, Nasir's daydream of hyper reality bendy diva dived down the poles of Metropolis for a night that London Collections: Men had never seen. Capturing everything, we lurked in shadows and danced in the spotlight while the seedy East London institution blossomed into the designer's vision of paradise. As pole dancers, naked except for slithers of Nasir Mazhar logo, hovered over Skepta, Boy Better Know Crew, Jammer, D Double E and Novelist, the turnt dancefloor escaped inside the designer's mind.

I had planted these free bulbs that I received without request in the rest of my order from directgardening.com around 5 months ago when they were planted in this 18 gallon container with amended compost.  Really, the best way to start is to find a few fresh bulbs from a friend and save the online order for something more difficult to find.\nDutch Iris In Bloom\n\nIn about a month after the bulbs had been placed in the soil, a few sword-like shoots appeared.  These shoots grew to over a foot tall and then the flower shoots started, became thick, and then flowered over the last five months.  The cut flowers last well in arrangements and should continue to provide new blooms each year from the rhizomes.\n\n\nDutch Iris Holland Grown In Bloom\nThis has been a very easy flower to grow so I would suggest it for the novice gardener.

Even if you feel you know everything there is to know about plumbing repairs, there is something in these videos for you. Just imagine if you could watch a plumber install and repair plumbing day by day, hour after hour. Could you imagine what you would learn? Yes, you could learn enough to start your own plumbing repair service. Not only would you save money, but you can make money. Well, your wish has come true. On these videos you will find and learn all the tricks of the trade that the pros already know. No more biting your nails when you call the plumber. No more taking off from work, staying at home waiting for the plumber to show up only to have him / her call you to say he or she may have to reschedule. With these plumbing videos you will be impressed and happy to know the knowledge is just an arm's reach away. \nPick up any one of the videos; toilet, bath, sink, tub and shower, kitchen sink, hot water heater and the sump pump. The list goes on. Every video has been created by a licensed plumber with over 25 years experience in plumbing repairs services. You will be watching a real plumber doing service, not someone that can just talk the talk, but can walk the walk. \nThere are no plumbing videos out there like these. It took years to develop these videos. We know there is a need out there for these plumbing repair videos. After years of plumbing service, we have come across many people who could really not afford a plumber and went years without plumbing services, even to the point that they would have to move from their home or pay thousands of dollars for plumbing repairs. If only these people had this knowledge, they could and would have saved their home and their money. \nWe know you are out there. We have come to save the day. Everyone does not have $90 to $200 to have a plumber come out just to tell them what the problem is and what it will cost to fix. We are not trying to put plumbers out of work. We are just trying to keep you out of the red. There will still be times when you may need a plumber, but wouldn't you feel good understanding what the plumber is doing and what you are getting for your money. You know that you are not going to be cheated because you have a better understanding of the problem and how it can be fixed.", "title": "Hot water heater relief valve", "publishedDate": "2007-09-18T01:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Sm9HUf6fcE", "description": "Baron Von Alias & Arhat - Cuckoo Crock\nBURNBLOCKBEATS 2008 OFFiCiAL MUSiC ViDEO\n\nVideo by Steesh:\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/#!/steesh.haggie\nTWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/thisissteesh\n\nBaron Von Alias Weblinks:\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/baronvonalias\nTWiTTER: http://www.twitter.com/baronvonalias\nBANDCAMP: http://baronvonalias.bandcamp.com\niTUNES: http://www.itunes.com/baronvonalias\nOFFiCAiL WEBSiTE: http://www.baronvonalias.com\n\nEMAiL: burnblockbeats@yahoo.co.uk", "title": "Baron Von Alias & Arhat - Cuckoo Crock (OFFiCiAL MUSiC ViDEO)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T15:53:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5SmZlg5KMRs", "description": "The driver is Beppo Harrach at a Rally in Austria.

Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a well-meaning but not especially bright fellow with a gift for making the worst of any situation. Bean is about to be fired from his job as a guard at the Royal Nation Art Gallery for sleeping on the job, but the Chairman (John Mills) intervenes at the last moment. To insure that his incompetence will manifest itself so completely that there will be no choice but to get rid of him, Bean's superiors come up with a plan -- they'll send him to America to speak at a posh private gallery owned by George Grierson (Harris Yulin), where General Newton (Burt Reynolds) will display the most recent addition to his art collection, \"Whistler's Mother.\" It's even money whether or not the museum will still be standing before Bean is done; as if this weren't enough, while in L.A. Bean is mistaken for a surgeon and forced to operate on an injured police officer. Richard Curtis, one of the film's producers, said after viewing the final product, \"It's an unpleasant family movie.

Size of each print overall is 38.5 x 25.5 inches (980 x 650 mm) and the size of this print without margins is // X // (// x //). The Leipzig Edition is printed on heavy cardstock like paper, without a gloss. The prints are collotypes. A collotype is an outdated printing technique that was commercially developed around 1868, and all but abandoned after Wold War 2. The collotype was the most accurate and beautiful photomechanical printing method of its time. Its process begins by drying a layer of light sensitive chrome gelatine on a glass plate (similar to the emulsions used by photographic glass plates). This gelatine coated glass plate becomes the printing. Like chromolithography, collotype is a multi-plate printing process.\n\nAcquistare da \u0430m\u0430z\u043en.it http://is.gd/rbbLiK", "title": "Stampa rara del", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T07:34:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5TCpfqIj2T0", "description": "Interview with ABC This Week, 6 days into the government shutdown.", "title": "Speaker Boehner reneged on his word", "publishedDate": "2013-10-06T15:00:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "5TCuc8ffu_0", "description": "\u00a9  Comparaison montagne Russe Next Gen Vs Old Gen !

I am an international student from China. Our project topic is how we can understand regulation and the presence of gender multiplicity here  thinking about the US. I am going to talk about a different perspective of gender, race and beauty ideals in China, which has never been colonized by the U.S, but has a close relationship in economy and culture. Since the last century, the U.S. and China have done a lot of trade. In addition, many Hollywood movies are imported into China and are very popular. Both trade and movies bring a new beauty standard to China. Women in China want to use whitening make-ups to make them look more like super stars in American movies. \n Besides that, eyelid surgery in China is also very popular. A number of Chinese women don't have a crease in the middle of eyelids, so eyelid surgery has become a significant part of cosmetic surgery in China. Why does one need an extra fold like two cracks running horizontally across the eyelid? Why is the smooth expanse of eyelid skin not perfect enough? The answer is that the desirable eye, the one extolled in the massive cosmetic industry blitz campaigns, is the Western eye, and the two lines provide the border for eye shadow and other make-up applications. This quote from Judith Halberstam's \"Female Masculinity\" that one of the group members gave to me.\n\n\n \"Scheer's rhetorical question as to why \"the smooth expanse of eyelid skin\" is not acceptable is supposed to ironize the relationship between body politics and market demands. A racially marked face is not only marginalized by a kind of economy of beauty, it is also quite obviously the product of imperialist, sexist, and racist ideologies. The cosmetic production of occidental beauty in this scene of cosmetic intervention, then, certainly ups the ante on racist and imperialist notions of aesthetics, but it also has the possibly unforeseen effects of making race obviously artificial, another fiction of culture.\n Cosmetic surgery can in a contradictory way, both bolster dominant ideologies of beauty and power, and it can undermine completely the fixedness of race, class, and gender by making each one surgically or sartorially reproducible.\"\n\nIn terms of gender multiplicity, these are good evidence that there are multiple gender performance based on race and culture instead of binary gender. By looking for the website of Chanel, the whitening products are only in the Chinese website but not in U.S. website. And eyelid surgery is not attractive to American women. In addition, Chinese women would never do tanning but American women love it so much. So we can see gender multiplicity does exist universally, and gender and race cannot be separated. Gender Performance should be related to race, just like we have those stereotypes for women from different races.   For example, Black women are bigger, more voluptuous, White women are tall, and Asian women are short, thin and delicate.\n\nHalberstam, Judith. Female Masculinity. Durham: Duke UP, 1998.

I ain't ready to check out. \n\nSalome' (Harmonies)\n\n(SEAN VERSE 1) Yeah, Pay attention i'm a walk the line. And make the kind of music that will get you through an awful time. Pour the wine, Divide the body and eat. I cure your mind with every rhyme kid you don't gotta be weak. Living in poverty we ain't thinking logically be, Your own man get with program i'm grinding for me. To leave a mark on the planet and give the people an outlet. Half you in the game ain't even about shit. I paid dues Sean Michael, NGP. Should have been number one, They cheated me on MTV. Another empty beat for me to fill with my train of thought. Got caught in a bad relationship i had to break it off. Kid i'm from New York a product of the golden era. My album true talk, The anthem for the colder weather. Throw a tantrum half broken as i wrote the letter. Never thought we'd fall apart, Only grow together. \n\n(Chorus) I can hear your heartbeat. Through all the pain in the track. And everything you took from me, You know i'm taking it back and in fact. I'm never giving up without a fight, When shit get trife you gotta live your life. (REPEAT) \n\n(SEAN VERSE 2) Never giving up i have to die a legend. Don't need your cover of a bunch of fucking tired freshmen. How much to buy attention, You make me wanna puke. I never had no money and grew up without my Father too. A shot of truth, Inject it deep in your blood flow. I love doe it make people evil and cut throat. One quote can change the way you live forever. Behave a little better. Find my name engraved on the hidden treasure. Forbidden pleasure, Bit the apple and i fucked a virgin. Permission never, In the castle with a bunch of Germans. You need to come determined, Or change your line of work. Because your pride ain't worth looking all foolish and rhyming hurt. I wipe the dirt from my shoulder and keep moving on. You might learn when your older, Now be true to Sean. Or prove i'm wrong, While the whole room eyeing me. Put it down one time for Snowgoons Dynasty.\n\n(Chorus) I can hear your heartbeat. Through all the pain in the track. And everything you took from me, You know i'm taking it back and in fact. I'm never giving up without a fight, When shit get trife you gotta live your life. (REPEAT) \n\n(Chorus) I can hear your heartbeat. Through all the pain in the track. And everything you took from me, You know i'm taking it back and in fact. I'm never giving up without a fight, When shit get trife you gotta live your life.

Im April hatte das belgische Fernsehen von einem mutma\u00dflichen Gebrauch derartiger Kampfstoffe im Norden Syriens berichtet. \nIn jener Reportage erkl\u00e4rte ein Arzt, wie den Betroffenen des vermeintlichen Sarin-Angriffes mittels der Verabreichung von Atropin das Leben gerettet wurde.\n\nSarin wurde Ende der 1930er Jahre von deutschen Chemikern entwickeln, die urspr\u00fcnglich ein Insektenvernichtungsmittel herstellen wollten und entdeckten, dass sich der Stoff als Waffe eignete. Zum Einsatz kam die Substanz im Zweiten Weltkrieg aber nicht.\n\nGesicherte Erkenntnis bestehen dar\u00fcber, dass das Regime des Saddam Hussein 1988 w\u00e4hrend des Irakkrieges neben anderen chemischen Waffen auch Sarin zu milit\u00e4rischen Zwecken nutzte.\n\nSarin ist farb-, geruch-, und geschmackslos. Eine Atemmaske allein reicht nicht, um sich gegen das Nervengift zu sch\u00fctzen. Denn auch \u00fcber Hautkontakt kann der Stoff in den K\u00f6rper gelangen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist Sarin wasserl\u00f6slich und kann deshalb etwa dem Trinkwasser zugesetzt werden.\n\nBereits kleine Mengen sind t\u00f6dlich. Ist der K\u00f6rper mit Sarin in Ber\u00fchrung gekommen, versagen allm\u00e4hlich seine Funktionen.\n\nW\u00e4hrend des Kalten Krieges lie\u00dfen sowohl die Vereinigten Staaten als auch die Sowjetunion gro\u00dfe Mengen des Kampfstoffes herstellen. Die britische Armee untersuchte in den 1950er Jahren die Wirkung des Giftes auf den Menschen, dabei kam 1953 ein Soldat ums Leben, nachdem dieser Sarin ausgesetzt worden war.\n\nDie Vereinten Nationen stufen den Stoff offiziell als Massenvernichtungswaffe ein, \nseit 1993 verbietet die Chemiewaffenkonvention den Einsatz von Sarin. Lediglich Angola, Nordkorea, der S\u00fcdsudan, \u00c4gypten, Somalia und Syrien haben diese Vereinbarung nicht unterzeichnet.\n\nBei den Anschl\u00e4gen in der Tokioter U-Bahn 1995 setzte die Aum-Sekte Sarin ein und t\u00f6tete 13 Menschen.\n\nDurch die Chemiewaffenkonvention von 1993 wurde die Vernichtung der Sarin-Vorr\u00e4te der unterzeichnenden L\u00e4nder geregelt. In Syrien, das die Konvention nicht unterst\u00fctzt, sollen - so sch\u00e4tzen Beobachter - nach wie vor mehr als 1000 Tonnen chemischer Kampfstoffe lagern, darunter Sarin.\n\nbleiben sie bei uns :\nYouTube: http://bit.ly/z5WTvy \nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/euronewsde", "title": "Massenvernichtungswaffe Sarin", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T08:38:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ThE70UN9_c", "description": "Christina shows how to format an external hard drive to use it as a time machine backup.

Visitors look down from a hill-top ledge / balcony, to witness the water leap over the cliff and form Jog Falls!\n\nJog Falls' cataracts.\n\nJog Falls is the second-highest plunge waterfall in India. Located near Sagara, Karnataka, these segmented falls are a major tourist attraction. They are also called Gersoppa Falls, Gersoppa Falls and Jogada Gundi.\n\n\"Jog Falls is created by the Sharavathi River falling from a height of 253 m (830 ft), making it the second-highest plunge waterfall in Asia after the Nohkalikai Falls with a height of 335 m (1100 ft) in Meghalaya.\n\nSharavati, a river which rises at Ambutirtha, near Nonabur, in the Thirthahalli taluk and takes the northwesterly course by Fatte petta, receives the Haridravati on the right below Pattaguppe and the Yenne Hole on the left above Barangi. On arriving at the frontier it bends to the west, precipitates itself down the Falls of Gersoppa, and passes that village (properly Geru-Sappe), which is some 29 kilometres distant, discharging into the sea at Honnavar in North Kanara.\n\nThe Sharavati, flowing over a very rocky bed about 250 yards wide, here reaches a tremendous chasm, 290 m (960 ft) deep, and the water comes down in four distinct falls. The Raja Fall pours in one unbroken column sheer to the depth of 830 ft (250 m). Halfway down it is encountered by the Roarer, another fall, which precipitates itself into a vast cup and then rushes violently downwards at an angle of forty-five degrees to meet the Raja. A third fall, the Rocket, shoots downwards in a series of jets; while the fourth, the Rani, moves quietly over the mountain side in a sheet of foam. The Tourism Department has built steps from the viewpoint to the bottom of the hill where the waterfall can be seen at the opposite side. There are approximately 1400 steps built to reach the bottom of the hill.\"\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
