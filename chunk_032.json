Other artists paid 2 pounds 30 shillings. Then again it was not a spruced-backed, maple-necked piece of craftsmanship -- it was a beat up old box!   \n\n1935 -- Age 10, Athol was playing piano at local dances. When he left school he worked on his father's farm and then as a farmhand on neighbouring properties. It was the guitar, the Tex Morton and Wilf Carter music that claimed his attention.\n\n1947 -- Age 22, his first break came when he was asked to sing on a radio program on 7AD Devonport. The program was on Tuesday nights and ran for three and a quarter years.\n\n1950 -- Moved to  Melbourne to expand his range of opportunities.  Won his heat of  Australia's Amateur Hour in 1950 and recorded for EMI.\n\n1951 -- Won the novelty section on the 'prestigious' radio show  P & A Parade.\n\nThis win brought him fairly constant work in radio and live performances but not a great deal of progress.\n\n1951-1958 -- He worked as a barman in Connell's  Railway Hotel.\n\n1956 -- He topped the poll on Terry Dear's  Australia's  Amateur Hour with over 10,000 votes.\n\nOn the strength of that success, he went to  Sydney for an audition with Regal Zonophone and was accepted. The first track he recorded Wilf Carter's 'Swiss Moonlight Lullaby' and his own composition 'Tassie Tears'. The recordings made him the first Tasmanian to sing from the magic grooves! Sales warranted more records.\n\n1956 & 1958 -- Puts down 4 additional tracks each year.\n\nAn outcome of the recording contract was an offer of a promotional tour of eastern states on Noel George's 'Australian Wild West Show'. The show also featured American Indian Wrestler Big Chief Little Wolf. Other tours for Athol at this time were also with the 'Reg Lindsay Show, Chad Morgan and Rick and Thel Shows'.\n\n1961 -- By the time he organised his own travelling show the best days for this type of entertainment had passed on the mainland. They were hard times for travelling shows. Nearly all the shows went bust. Athol headed back to  Tasmania.\n\n1966 -- Athol toured full time again.  He teamed up with his boyhood idol 'Tex Morton' with a show called The Morton's and McCoy's\n\nThe tour started in Morven QLD, through to the Isa, across to Alice Springs, back through the settlements to  Darwin where they did a three-week season showing nightly, across the  Kimberley's down to  Western Australia and across the Nullarbor.\n\nAfter the  Tex shows ended, he toured with Terry Gordon, Ray Haselar Lindsay Butler and others.\n\nBack in  Sydney he recorded for RCA with Eileen Wood on fiddle who also toured with him and then became Mrs Athol McCoy\".\n\n1969 -- At the end of the year, he had a break from touring and gained a job with the Reserve Bank in  Melbourne.\n\n1972-1973 -- He made his last tour of  Australia.\n\n1973 -- Hadley Records in  Tamworth acquired the rights to most of Athol's recorded output and issued an album of his work.\n\nAthol and Eileen settled in Bega NSW and had their own business.  They also worked clubs occasionally as the 'Real McCoy's' duo.\n\n1980 -- Inducted into the  Hands of Fame in  Tamworth.\n\n1996 -- June 6 Athol passed away in  Bega Hospital.\n\n2005 -- Inducted to the Australian Country Music Roll of Renown", "title": "Athol McCoy - Just Because", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T09:26:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xfciIXD-sg", "description": "For more videos and games check out our new website at http://www.sesamestreet.org\n\nThis clip is a music video about wet paint.\n\nSesame Street is a production of Sesame Workshop, a nonprofit educational organization which also produces Pinky Dinky Doo, The Electric Company, and other programs for children around the world.", "title": "Sesame Street: Wet Paint", "publishedDate": "2009-01-09T20:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "0xfgJExJa74", "description": "Games + Cards g\u00fcnstiger bei MMOGA: http://mmo.ga/Gox7\nThemen am 31.

A must-have follow up package rocking the Zouk imprint. \n\nThe Romanian producers behind Residence Deejays teamed up with American vocalist and producer Frissco. He tells us a little something about his flirty club-adventures, while the Residence Deejays turn up the heat with a deep, proghousy background. Clear synths and melodic beats make this 'Sexy Love Frisco Club Extended' a true club-anthem. \n\nOn the remixes we first find Greek producer Agent Greg. His rework focuses on progressive elements and with that 'Sexy Love' stands out with even more energy to its original. Another banging remix comes from Peter Rauhofer.

If you're trying to decide on a kind of lube, think about silicone- vs. water-based lube. Water-based lube is great if you use a lot of toys because a lot of toys have silicone ingredients in them. If you use dildos or butt plugs that are silicone, any silicone toys, you do not want to use silicone lube directly on them. Like bonds with like. You won't be able to wash your silicone lube off all the way. Definitely use water based lube if you use a lot of silicone toys. Any lube we have, water- or silicone-based, you can use with both latex and non-latex condoms.\n\nMost of our lube is water-based. It's really good stuff. You're made of water; the lube's mostly made of water. It blends. It's natural. It feels great. It adds slipperiness right when you start. These lubes are wonderful and non-sticky. Why are they non-sticky? There's no sugar in them. It's a brilliant thing. Way too many lubes out there have sugar in them, also known as glycerin. Sugar basically makes lube sticky. Sure, it might make it taste like candy, but you don't need sugar to have a great lube. Sugar actually increases the chance of yeast infections for women\u2014that's no fun.\n\nWhen you use a water-based lube, you want to look for something that is glycerin free or sugar free. That means you won't have stickiness issues. You'll notice we don't sell any KY or Astroglide. That's because most of their products are chock full of sugar. They're going to get sticky, and they might irritate or cause yeast infections. Yeast eats sugar, so if you put a bunch of sugar in a vulva, you might be inviting yeast. Not cool.\n\nAre you interested in really long lasting, amazing lubricant that you can massage with and use in the shower or the hot tub? \nHave you ever wanted to use a lubricant to have sex in the hot tub? You realize all the lubricant flushes away, all the wetness it provide flushes away. How are we going to have sex without it hurting and feeling really weird? Only silicone lube will really stay wet underwater. Silicone lube is brilliant. There are a lot of different brands. They're all going to feel really, really slippery. They feel a bit like oil. You can't use oil with regular latex condoms whereas silicone lubricant, while it feels oily, is totally safe to use with latex condoms. Silicone lubricants are totally safe to use on your skin. If you eat them that's okay, if they get inside your orifices that's obviously okay\u2014don't be scared of silicone! It's totally safe. The molecules are bigger than your pores, so the silicone stays on the surface of your skin and it doesn't get absorbed. \n\nYou'll also notice when you go to clean up after a good time with silicone lube, it lasts and lasts and lasts. If you're looking for a quickie at lunch, maybe don't use silicone lube because you'll feel like you're walking a little bit funny after that even if you've wiped down.

It is the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew. The term is often used to specify a ship's maximum permissible deadweight, the DWT when the ship is fully loaded so that its Plimsoll line is at the point of submersion, although it may also denote the actual DWT of a ship not loaded to capacity. Deadweight tonnage is not a measure of the ship's displacement and should not be confused with gross tonnage or net tonnage (or their more archaic forms gross register tonnage or net register tonnage).\nDeadweight tonnage was historically expressed in long tons but is now usually given internationally in tonnes (metric tons). In modern international shipping conventions such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, deadweight is explicitly defined as the difference in tonnes between the displacement of a ship in water of a specific gravity of 1.025 (corresponding to average density of sea water) at the draft corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard and the light displacement (lightweight) of the ship.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Deadweight tonnage", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T23:34:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0y-hgRtw95g", "description": "Ironside's Video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n61VgcqA-LU\nIronside's Channel - http://www.youtube.com/user/IronsideComputers\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Got_Drums\nLike me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/GotThoseDrums\n\n------------------------------------\nSponsored by:\nController Plus\n5% Promo Code - \"DRUMS\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ControllerPlus\n------------------------------------\n\nFree Computer\nFree PC\nFree Gaming PC", "title": "Win A Free Ironside Gaming Computer!", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15T18:44:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0y-hsqr7edA", "description": "The pad that I wet was a daytime pad not the overnight one the day one dont really absorb but the overnight one does.", "title": "wetting a always super long maxi pad", "publishedDate": "2011-09-02T23:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0y-j7fCFRls", "description": "How to make Salmon Fry using Indian flavors.

I know I don't sound like it. Marinated two days, garlic and rosemary and buttermilk. It goes into the seasoned flour that I made earlier, and I really try and pack it in now. I don't -- I want the flour to be there. I don't want like a half-baked job., and I'm going to make a big pile of chicken, because it's my favorite. \n\nAgain, I apologize to you Southern grandmothers, because I know your chicken is probably better than mine, but I do my best. Again, this is a MSG-free recipe. We're cooking this at a lesser temperature, because chicken cooks at 350, where everything else we do it 450. When it gets to be as nearly as brown as you want it, we''ll then transfer it onto a tray. \n\nPut it through the oven, just to finish it off, because you don't want the outside too brown and the inside raw, because raw chicken is obviously not a good thing. All right, so we're using a smaller fryer this time, because it's a lower temperature. Really force that flour in and drop it in there. The secret is having a good crust on the outside. \n\nYou know that when you eat fried chicken that's the favorite bit, right? It's the skin and the crust. It's just -- it's amazing. My biggest regret is that Britain didn't invent the fried chicken. We could claim it for ourselves then, but unfortunately, or fortunately for you guys. And we generally serve half at once. We don't serve it here. \n\nWhen I serve it I generally serve half a chicken a person, a leg, a thigh and two pieces of breast. I serve it with mash potatoes and green beans and some gravy. It's my idea of heaven and that's the chicken frying. You see that nice crust on the outside. Okay, this isn't quite cooked yet. It's nice and brown on the outside. I'm going to put it in the oven at about 325-350, for about 15-20 minutes, just to cook it through.

This amazing animal is killed by millions, worldwide sharks population has a 90% decline. Estimated 150,000,000 sharks are killed every year. This is a dramatic figure of over exploitation of sharks and a way of damaging one of the largest and most important ecosystems on the planet. The consequences are unpredictable and tragic for future generations we have to understand that any changes in nature trigger collateral changes that affect all species. Sharks are top predators in the marine ecosystem and therefore have a key role in maintaining the trophic balance and biodiversity. Given the human ignorance and greed for their wholesale destruction, they need all the help they can get. Do fish feel pain? Yes they do. Scientists presents facts and research to show that fish feel pain, and expose the cruelty involved in angling. Fish pain and suffering in angling its a fact. Do fish have any feelings? In my opinion and experience, yes, they do, as does all animal life. If you spear or angling a fish, do they suffer, do they scream silently, do they feel pain. Yes they do.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Peter Quince at the Clavier by Wallace Stevens", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T10:09:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yTRMyZi6uQ", "description": "Jaja Buenisimo", "title": "Bailando Stridance", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T01:56:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yTlaPk3UQM", "description": "Coffee print: \" Chinese Lion Head\"\nArtist/ Illustrator: Bo Sun Lam\nLocation: England", "title": "Coffee art - Bo Sun Lam", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T21:20:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yU1r2AOvWw", "description": "Thread here:\n\nhttp://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1052469\n\nLivestream: http://www.twitch.tv/manocean/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ManoceanStream\n\nDonate: http://imraising.com/manocean", "title": "How I use Blood Magic / Sapping Flask / Divination Distillate to ensure a smooth culling of Dominus.", "publishedDate": "2014-09-12T20:41:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yUIKtDHMFs", "description": "", "title": "Why Kelly Ripa Is No Supermom", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T05:02:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yUQBr77DnQ", "description": "Some grown adults having too much fun riding the kiddie coaster at Fun Spot USA! =)\n\nFilmed & Edited by Robb Alvey for Fun Spot USA in Kissimmee, Florida.

The black-footed ferret is a small carnivore considered one of the most endangered mammals in North America and before 1981 was thought to have been extinct. It was in 1981 that a small population of ferrets was discovered near Meteetse, Wyoming, and there began an amazing story of bringing a native species back from near extinction! The remaining population was brought into a captive breeding program and now black-footed ferrets are back in the wild at 19 release sites, 17 in the United States, one in Canada and one in Mexico.\n\nAfter a 42 day gestation period the little kits are born blind and nearly completely bald. They grow very quickly and will first open their eyes around six weeks old. You can watch the ferrets at the Phoenix Zoo live on our streaming webcam here: http://www.camzone.com/phx-ferret\n\nLearn more about black-footed ferret conservation and our breeding program by visiting http://www.phoenixzoo.org/learn/conservation_efforts_details.aspx?ARTICLE_ID=100095\n\nhttp://www.phoenixzoo.org -- Visit us!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PhoenixZoo - Like us!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PhoenixZoo - Follow us!\nhttp://www.instagram.com/PhoenixZoo - See fun photos from the Zoo!", "title": "Tiny Newborn Black-footed Ferret Kits", "publishedDate": "2013-05-21T22:45:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yetHqWODp0", "description": "", "title": "Life=Risk--Motivation", "publishedDate": "2006-12-16T04:59:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yf2hvbd-3k", "description": "AD INFEROS - Laberintos Mentales\nGenero: Simb\u00f3lico Metal Visionario\nManizales  Caldas Colombia\n\n8.

Sufian Abed Rabbo said his extended family of 17 had taken refuge under the stairway in their home.\n\n\"God help us. We have nothing to do but pray,\" the 27-year-old told The Associated Press by phone. \"I don't know who left and who stayed, but in our street, we are all very scared to move.\"\n\nLater Monday, Israeli forces fired a large numbers of flares over Gaza City, turning the night sky a bright orange.\n\nThe latest bloodshed came despite mounting international calls for a cease-fire and followed failed attempts by both sides to agree to even a lull in fighting of several hours for the start of the three-day Muslim holiday of Eid el-Fitr that marks the end of Ramadan.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said 10 people, including nine children under the age of 12, were killed and 46 wounded in the blast at a park in the Shati refugee camp on the outskirts of Gaza City.\n\nEach side blamed the other.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the explosion was caused when a rocket launched by Gaza militants misfired and landed in the park. Palestinian police and civil defense said an Israeli missile hit as children were playing on a swing set.\n\n\"The children were playing and were happy, enjoying Eid, and they got hit,\" said Nidal Aljerbi, a witness.\n\nAfter three weeks of bloodshed, both Israel and Hamas are holding out for bigger gains and a cease-fire remains elusive, despite an appeal by the U.N. Security Council and growing pressure from the United States.\n\nIsrael says its troops will not leave Gaza until they have demolished scores of Hamas military tunnels under the Gaza-Israel border that militants use to infiltrate Israel and smuggle weapons. Hamas says it will not cease fire until it receives international guarantees Gaza's 7-year-old border blockade by Egypt and Israel will be lifted.\n\nNetanyahu defended the Gaza air and ground offensive, saying in a televised speech Monday that \"there is no war more just than this.\"\n\nIsrael has said it is defending its citizens against attack from Gaza by hitting Hamas rocket launchers, weapons storage sites and military tunnels. However, there is growing U.S. frustration with the mounting number of Palestinian casualties - at least 1,072 killed and 6,450 wounded since July 8, the vast majority civilians, according to Hamas health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military says 52 soldiers have been killed, including four killed Monday in a mortar attack on southern Israel. Two Israeli civilians and a Thai citizen working in Israel also have been killed.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have been pressing Israel to accept an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire.\n\nThe Obama administration pushed back Monday against a torrent of Israeli criticism over Kerry's latest bid to secure a cease-fire with Hamas, accusing some in Israel of launching a \"misinformation campaign\" against the top American diplomat.\n\n\"It's simply not the way partners and allies treat each other,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\n\nHer comments were echoed by the White House, where officials said they were disappointed by Israeli reports that cast Kerry's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire as more favorable to Hamas.\n\nIsrael had accepted an Egyptian call for an unconditional cease-fire early in its Gaza campaign, but Hamas rejected the idea.", "title": "ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER WARNS OF PROLONGED CAMPAIGN IN GAZA WAR", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T11:04:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yoYXLb84EM", "description": "Ceci est ma premi\u00e8re vid\u00e9o critique.\nJe n'en dirais pas plus dans cette description\nSource : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a_tluf_cbA\nhttps://secure.avaaz.org/fr/petition/Le_grand_journal_Canal_Excuse_a_la_communaute_jeux_videos_ludiques_dans_le_prochain_Grand_Journal/?nOfFkhb%EF%BB%BF", "title": "Critique - Le grand journal - Canal+ - Twitch", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T16:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yocCdjA-zE", "description": "http://goo.gl/ZvdFt\nThe Jambox grows up and, not surprisingly, sounds a lot better.", "title": "First Look: Jawbone's Big Jambox", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T11:41:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yoiFxjXDyk", "description": "", "title": "Toma mi mano (lyrics / letra)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-17T21:31:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yoiPx_-iJA", "description": "http://www.newsynergyss.com/contact.

In those times, there was no difference between science and ideology, so the \"Macedonian\" historiography, unopposed by anybody, comfortably performed a selection of the historic material from which the \"Macedonian\" identity was created.\n\nIt has been claimed that from 1944 till the end of the 1940s people espousing a Bulgarian ethnic identity had been oppressed. According to Bulgarian sources more than 100,000 men were imprisoned under the new \"Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor\" for refusing to declare they were ethnic Macedonians. Some 1,200 prominent Bulgarians were sentenced to death in the towns of Skopje, Veles, Kumanovo, Bitola and Stip. In 1946 two Bulgarian\n\npoliticians were sentenced to death and another 74 men jailed for attempting to detach SR Macedonia from Yugoslvaia and join it with Bulgaria. The Communist authorities were successful in removing all Bulgarian influence in the region. In Macedonia the Bulgarophobia increased almost to the level of state ideology.\".\n\n(Denko Maleski, Minister of foreign affairs of the FYROM from 1991 to 1993 in an interview to FYROM newspaper Utrinski Vesnik October 16, 2006)", "title": "Mr Denko Maleski - FYROM is rather NOT 'Macedonia' 1.", "publishedDate": "2010-11-27T22:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "0yxuq-BoDIQ", "description": "OilMan: Seekers of black gold\nNew iOS Exclusive Game for iPhone & iPad\n\nEnter to win an amazing grand prize!\nWin the original hand-painted portrait of Johnny Dick Rockwell, the main character of OilMan: Seekers of Black Gold. \u00a0Hand-painted by Marcus Park, the illustrator of Oilman, only one original exists in the world.

Abaixa a bola, pobre. Abaixa a bola, pobre\". Filmado em uma creperia de um shopping na Barra da Tijuca, uma discuss\u00e3o entre duas mulheres est\u00e1 ganhando repercuss\u00e3o nas redes sociais. Principalmente porque, durante o bate boca, uma delas tenta se impor chamando a outra de pobre, dizendo que mora num triplex, que trabalha h\u00e1 40 anos no Aeroporto Internacional e que pode dar emprego aos funcion\u00e1rios da loja onde tudo ocorreu.\n\nNenhuma das duas envolvidas foi identificada at\u00e9 o momento. Nas imagens, percebe-se que a outra cliente, sentada a sua mesa, evita brigar, limitando-se a rebater o tom amea\u00e7ador com palavras. \"Tenho medo de maluco\", diz. Ao ouvir isso, a mulher de p\u00e9 passa a gritar e gesticular energicamente. \"E eu tenho medo de pobre\", responde ela. \"Quem \u00e9 voc\u00ea, minha filha? Abaixa a bola, pobre. Abaixa a bola, pobre. Vai chamar [o gerente]? Vai ousar? Voc\u00ea pode dar emprego para ela [para a atendente que foi requisitada para chamar o gerente]? Eu posso. Voc\u00ea pode?\".\n\nEm sua mesa e tentando comer, a mulher que sofria ataques verbais bateu palmas e, ironicamente, deu \"parab\u00e9ns\".\n\nA resposta, novamente, veio imediata:\n\n\"Palmas para voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m, rid\u00edcula, pobre. Eu n\u00e3o sou rica, sou consciente, o que voc\u00ea deveria ser, como pobre. Rid\u00edcula. Rid\u00edcula. Rid\u00edcula. Porque eu sou classe dominante e fico revoltada. Voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma idiota\".\n\nSegundo Ana Let\u00edcia, propriet\u00e1ria do Crepelocks, estabelecimento onde ocorreu a discuss\u00e3o, o caso foi at\u00edpico e a mulher encontrava-se transtornada.\n\n- Eu n\u00e3o estava mais no local mas minha gerente me ligou para pedir autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o para chamar a seguran\u00e7a. Segundo relatos dos funcion\u00e1rios, a cliente n\u00e3o consumiu nenhuma comida, somente bebida. Perguntei se tinha ocorrido algum problema com o servi\u00e7o ou algum desentendimento com outro cliente mas parece que ela ficou transtornada por um motivo bobo e apresentava estar fora de si.\n\nAo final do v\u00eddeo, uma outra mulher tenta retir\u00e1-la do local o que foi negado com um \"n\u00e3o tem problema, eu sou psic\u00f3loga tamb\u00e9m\" para o riso de quem estava presente.\n\nQuando reparou que estava sendo filmada, o alvo das ofensas mudou. O grupo que filmava passou a ser alvo de insultos homof\u00f3bicos.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria, por\u00e9m, continuou por mais tempo, de acordo com Ana Let\u00edcia. Mais insultos e ofensas foram proferidas at\u00e9 os seguran\u00e7as do shopping chegarem para tentar, com muita resist\u00eancia, retir\u00e1-la da loja. Mesmo assim, repetidas vezes a cliente voltou com a justificativa que n\u00e3o tinha pago a conta e era, mais vezes, requisitada a se retirar.", "title": "'Abaixa a bola, pobre', afirma mulher durante discuss\u00e3o em shopping center no Rio", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T20:17:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zUXKSVYzKE", "description": "20th May, 2010 Kampung Coldstream, Bidor\nHere is a clip showing the Weaver bird stutching up its nest", "title": "Weaver, Baya - Ploceus philippinus", "publishedDate": "2010-05-22T00:55:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zUe9cVA9h8", "description": "", "title": "Chameleon-Carmina Valles-Theme Summer's Lease", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T01:12:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zUeKj8EfLg", "description": "For more information visit: http://www.atmos.illinois.edu/~meiyapp2/datasets.htm .

It was a touching moment to see two of the most famous characters in pro wrestling bury the hatchet & find peace & closure.\n\nhttp://www.MATTHARDYBRAND.com\nhttp://www.ShopMattHardy.com\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/MATTHARDYBRAND\nhttp://www.twitter.com/MATTHARDYBRAND\nhttp://www.Facebook.MATTHARDYBRAND.com\nhttp://www.google.com/+MATTHARDYBRAND\nhttp://www.instagram.com/MATTHARDYBRAND\nhttp://www.TheHardyShow.com", "title": "Bret Hart & Earl Hebner Make Peace!", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T07:34:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zVnO4yJetM", "description": "Visit us at: www.flaggassociates.com - A project created for Tripod Project.", "title": "Tripod Conceptual Framework - Captivation", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T01:46:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zVpakgQrPM", "description": "http://www.GameXplain.com\nCheck out a high quality version of the Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask trailer for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\n\u2022 Follow GameXplain on...\n...Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/gamexplain\n...Twitter: http://twitter.com/GameXplain\n...Google+: https://plus.google.com/108004348435696627453\n...and GameXplain.com of course: http://www.GameXplain.com", "title": "Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D Trailer (High Quality!)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T22:42:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zW-TEGt-ZA", "description": "Sundowner - Chris McCaughan of The Lawrence Arms.\n\nWhere - The Knitting Factory, New York City.\n\nWhen - December 1st 2007.", "title": "Sundowner - Intransit (The Lawrence Arms)", "publishedDate": "2007-12-02T14:54:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0zW2sPScpFg", "description": "In today's episode, Dr.Phil talks with a family that's accused their own mother of being a whore.

They persevered in true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in charity and patience, and so every day they advanced in spirit and gained great favor with God. They were given for example to all religious, and ought more to excite us to advance in good, than the number of lukewarm to induce us to grow remiss.

How vigorous the discipline that was kept up, what reverence and obedience, under the rule of their superior, flourished in all! Their traces that remain still bear witness, that they were truly holy and perfect men who did battle so stoutly, and trampled the world under their feet. Now, he is thought great who is not a transgressor and who can, with patience, endure what he has undertaken.

Add an element of creativity to your drinks with this wonderful ice mold. In this video, Kara, Product Expert for Williams-Sonoma shows us how to use the Japanese Ice Maker.\n\nThis Japanese Ice Maker comes with two ice cube trays that make cubes of the perfect size and shape for the mold. Kara soaks the two pieces of the mold in warm water before using it. She then places one half of the mold on a plate to catch any runs. She then places an ice cube in the center and covers the ice cube by placing the other half on top. Within no time, the Japanese Ice Maker produces a perfectly spherical ice cube. She continues the procedure by following the same steps for the rest of the cubes. \n\nYou can use this ice mold to shape ice cubes for both alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic drinks. A good thing about these cubes is that since these sphere cubes have less surface area than a traditional cube, they won't dilute your drink quickly.

He set out after high school change the way that math education is taught, received and viewed.  He believes that every child in this world has the right to access quality education especially math education as it allows students to open new doors and grow intellectually in other fields.  Mr. Brian McLogan has taught Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry and Pre-Calculus as a high school math teacher.  He strives everyday to make math more meaningful, enjoyable and different every day.  He is currently embarking on a mission to complete math videos for the major courses he has taught so that he can begin to focus more of his time creating unique and creative lessons for his classes. Creating new lessons is something that many teachers love to do but fall victim to having to go back to only teaching the processes of the course because the students need to know the information for their final test or next math class and they do not have the time to cover everything they would like.  Mr. Brian McLogan feels students lose a lot of meaning of mathematics this way and are often deterred from the subject like he was.  To prevent this Mr. Brian McLogan wants his videos to help supplement education so that more time can be spent working on problems in class or creating new lessons.", "title": "6.3 How to find the resultant vector of the difference of two vectors", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T16:30:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-34sa1mM5g", "description": "Ihttp://www.UpYourService.com - http://www.RonKaufman.com\nt's true.

Once decompression has been done it is much easier to perform the CCC both because of the decreased tendency for the rhexis to run out and better visibility.\nWhile doing phacoemulsification it should be noted that there is no protective cushion of cortical matter and the phaco energy is directly transmitted to the capsule.

The largely college-age crowd walked in a silence broken only by their footsteps on the pavement.\n\nUCSB student Christian Perez was a neighbor to one of the victims.\n\n\"My next door neighbor was one of the victims who passed away. So it was tough this morning finding that. I'm just trying to make sense of the unsensible,\" Perez said.\n\nElliot Rodger, the son of a Hollywood director, stabbed three people to death in his apartment before gunning down three more victims on Friday night in the town of Isla Vista near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nRodger opened fire on bystanders from his car and on foot in a killing spree that ended when he took his life after a shootout with sheriff's deputies, police said. Authorities found three legally purchased semi-automatic guns, two Sig Sauers and a Glock, and more than 400 rounds of ammunition in his car.\n\nStudent Toby Qualls said he believed it was difficult to stop violence of this kind.\n\n\"You know I feel like it's something that will always happen because this is a free country and it's hard to regulate every single individual. There's always going to be maniacs - that's always going to occur but it is crazy the amount of stuff that happens like this and sad. But I don't know how easy it is to remedy the situation,\" Qualls said.\n\nAt least 13 people were wounded, including eight who were shot.\n\nThe incident was the latest mass shooting in the United States, where schools, shopping malls and military bases have been scenes of such crimes.\n\nIn December 2012, 20 children and six adults were killed at an elementary school in Connecticut, six months after a gunman killed 14 people in a Colorado movie theater.\n\nThe deadliest U.S. mass shooting in modern times was in 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech killed 32 people.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntdtv.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Thousands Hold Vigil For The Victims Of The Santa Barbara Shooting", "publishedDate": "2014-05-25T14:24:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-E2F1dHWb8", "description": "Midnight Water Colour (Figures)\nmore info: www.midnightfestival.com\n\ntrack: Luka Caro, Parquez, Alex del Amo feat Theory - People Everywhere OUT SOON for JUMMP RECORDS", "title": "AFTERMOVIE MIDNIGHT WATER COLOUR @ FIGUERES", "publishedDate": "2014-08-13T18:56:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-E3DgTNztE", "description": "Residual Kid performs \"Friday on my Mind\" by The Easybeats (1966), recorded for our friend Miri Hyman, who passed away on July 4, 2014. 100% of proceeds from the 'name your own price' sale of this single will go to Hospice Austin and Livestrong, in honor of Miri. www.residualkid.com\n\nVideo by Tony Stout Productions and shot at Holy Mountain.

Wearing his deep skepticism like armor, Michael challenges his superiors to look to psychiatry, rather than demons, in treating the possessed. Only when he's sent to apprentice with the unorthodox Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins)--a legendary priest who has performed thousands of exorcisms--does Michael's armor begin to fall. As he is drawn into a troubling case that seems to transcend even Father Lucas's skill, he begins to glimpse a phenomenon science can't explain or control...and an evil so violent and terrifying that it forces him to question everything he believes.\n MPAA Rating: PG-13  \u00a9 2011 New Line Productions, Inc.

Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Jules Feiffer, E.C. Segar\nFilm Description: Based on the long-running comic strip created by E.C. Segar (and less on the animated cartoons created by Max Fleischer, which were decidedly different in tone and approach), Popeye follows the sailor man with the mighty arms (played by Robin Williams in his first major film role) as he arrives in the seaside community of Sweethaven in search of his long-lost father. Popeye meets and quickly falls for the slender Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall, in the role she was born to play), but Olive's hand has already been promised to the hulking Bluto (Paul Smith), of whom Olive can say little except, well, he's large. Eventually, Popeye and Olive are brought together by Swee' Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), an adorable foundling, and Popeye finally meets his dad, Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walston). Director Robert Altman in no way tempered his trademark style for this big-budget family opus, crowding the screen with a variety of characters and allowing his cast to overlap as much dialogue as they want.\n\npopeye,\"popeye clip\",\"popeye the sailor man\",\"popeye cartoon\",\"robin williams\",\"shelley duvall\",\"robert altman\",\"pipe videos\",\"action adventure\",adventure,\"ages 11-12\",\"ages 5-7\",\"ages 8-10\",\"children family\",comedy,\"cult comedies\",\"family comedies\",musicals,\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"scott bushnell\",\"aggression videos\",\"jealousy videos\",\"power videos\",\"self control videos\",\"strength videos\",\"village videos\",\"olive oyl\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++65569,/m/0dzf_,/m/0421st", "title": "Popeye (3/8) Movie CLIP - Bluto Blows!

There exist many types, but all of them, although different in constructability, stay true to the quality and reliability.  Each year, world's leaders in technical industries consider their mistakes and wishes of their customers to improve production technologies for this or that component of electronic machines and apparatuses, in order to help a consumer save a couple of bucks on a purchase of a new tool. Each electrical tool has its own technical capabilities. For example, production of a screwdriver requires different kinds of rotation transmission mechanisms.  The most interesting of such mechanisms is an epicyclical one - or a mechanism with an epicyclical gearbox. An epicyclical gearbox has a type of transmission that belongs to direct rotation contact gears. Such rotational motion transmission mechanisms are used to transfer energy from engines to the working mechanisms converting speeds, forces and torques. An epicyclical gearbox is one of the gear models. It consists of several gear rings that are located inside the solar case, of planetary pinions and an outer (crown) gear with internal gearing. The high quality of epicyclical gearbox is supported by its durability and high torques. The following can be considered the core elements of epicyclical gear:Central (sun) gear - located in the center of the mechanism.Carrier (driven gear): Securely fixes the axis of several planetary pinions (satellites) of the same size that are geared to the sun gear with respect to each other,Ring gear: External gear wheel internally geared to the planetary pinions.When epicyclical gear is used as a reducer, one of its three core elements is fixed, the other one is used as a driver, and the third one as a driven element. Thus the contact ratio would depend on the number of teeth of each of the components, as well as on which component is fixed.Modern devices can use cascades consisting of several epicyclical gearboxes to achieve a wider range of reduction ratios. Many automated devices and facilities operate based on this principle.", "title": "Epicyclical Gearbox", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T03:18:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-HpXrxNYII", "description": "Artista/Artist: MARIA ANTONIETTA\nCanzone/Song Title: \"SALIVA\"\n\nPresentato da/Presented by BAND & BREAKFAST\nLocation: B&B Via dell'Astrologo, Cosenza\n\nDicembre, 2011\n\nSi ringraziano/Thanks to PICICCA EDIZIONI E SPORCO IMPOSSIBILE\n\n+ info\nmariaantoniettamusica.tumblr.com\nwww.bandandbreakfast.net", "title": "MARIA ANTONIETTA||SALIVA::BAND & BREAKFAST::SESSIONI ACUSTICHE::LIVE IN COSENZA", "publishedDate": "2012-01-06T09:05:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-HtD6uWSp0", "description": "\u00a9 No Copyright Infringement Intended.

Many of these victims were brutally executed; many more died of starvation, exhaustion, and disease.\n\nThat these crimes were committed so recently (1975-1978) makes them all the more sickening. The country's scars are still plainly visible:\n\n- The population is suspiciously youthful (50% is under the age of 15).\n\n- The economy is in shambles. This is partially thanks to the Khmer Rouge's execution of the upper and educated classes. The fact that they destroyed most of the vehicles and machines in the cities can't have helped.\n\n- New human remains turn up around the exhumed mass graves of the Killing Fields of Cheoung Ek on a daily basis. Silent reminders of the tragedy, these bones and teeth are ceremoniously placed into makeshift shrines in tree hollows and cement planters.\n\nIt's hard to comprehend the motivations behind an atrocity like the Cambodian genocide. What could have been going through the minds of the Khmer Rouge officers and their leader Pol Pot?\n\n\"Hey Pol, I've got an idea, man. Let's turn the country upside down and get real primitive. Evacuate all the cities, march everyone out to the country. And then start farming, man! Big time. And if anyone resists, let's execute them. In fact, let's kill a whole lot of people. I'm talking hundreds of thousands. Maybe millions. And do it real cruel-like. Bash their heads against trees, electrocute 'em, drown 'em in vats of cold water...\"\n\nFear must have been the prevailing motivator in the regime. How could an officer commit such monstrous crimes against his own countrymen? For fear that something even worse would happen to him.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge atrocity seems to follow a time-honored recipe for genocide: the obsessive desire to reach a religious or political ideal coupled with a healthy dose of madness.\n\nWhy don't we learn? It seems as if past atrocities of genocide haven't served as a warning, but instead as a blueprint for how to repeat them.\n\nBut if history has proven human beings to be intrinsically fallible, it has also proven us to be extraordinarily resilient. Pol Pot cast a heavy shadow over Cambodia, but the people have managed to persevere, begin anew, and find joy in life again.\n\n\u2028--\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the genocide in Cambodia, visit the Yale Cambodian Genocide Project at http://www.yale.edu/cgp/.", "title": "Cambodian Genocide - Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge", "publishedDate": "2007-08-06T17:26:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-SIQ1kfrH0", "description": "Geoffrey Abraskin, PT, DPT of Amedisys Home Health & Hospice Care discusses what Occupational Therapy is and how it can be used in a home care setting.

Esta opini\u00e3o ainda \u00e9 defendida por alguns autores modernos que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o de \u00e1reas psicom\u00e9tricas. No seu artigo New Methods for the Diagnosis of the Intellectual Level of Subnormals Binet relata: Esta escala, propriamente falando, n\u00e3o permite a medida da intelig\u00eancia, porque as qualidades intelectuais n\u00e3o s\u00e3o sobrepon\u00edveis e, portanto, n\u00e3o pode ser medido como superf\u00edcies lineares s\u00e3o medidos, mas s\u00e3o, pelo contr\u00e1rio, uma classifica\u00e7\u00e3o, uma hierarquia entre as diversas intelig\u00eancias, e para as necessidades da pr\u00e1tica dessa classifica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 equivalente a uma medida.[2] Com pr\u00e1tica,treino e, acima de tudo, m\u00e9todo - escreveu Alfred Binet em 1909, podemos aprimorar nossa aten\u00e7\u00e3o, nossa mem\u00f3ria, nosso julgamento, e literalmente nos tornamos mais inteligentes do que jamais fomos. Em 1912, Wilhelm Stern prop\u00f4s o termo \"QI\" (quociente de intelig\u00eancia) para representar o n\u00edvel mental, e introduziu os termos \"idade mental\" e \"idade cronol\u00f3gica\". Stern prop\u00f4s que o QI fosse determinado pela divis\u00e3o da idade mental pela idade cronol\u00f3gica. Assim uma crian\u00e7a com idade cronol\u00f3gica de 10 anos e n\u00edvel mental de 8 anos teria QI 0,8, porque 8 / 10 = 0,8. Em 1916, Lewis Madison Terman prop\u00f4s multiplicar o QI por 100, a fim de eliminar a parte decimal: QI = 100 x IM / IC, em que IM = idade mental e IC = idade cronol\u00f3gica. Com esta f\u00f3rmula, a crian\u00e7a do exemplo acima teria QI 80. A classifica\u00e7\u00e3o proposta por Lewis Terman era a seguinte: QI acima de 140: Genialidade 121 - 140: Intelig\u00eancia muito acima da m\u00e9dia 110 - 120: Intelig\u00eancia acima da m\u00e9dia 90 - 109: Intelig\u00eancia normal (ou m\u00e9dia) 80 - 89: Embotamento 70 - 79: Lim\u00edtrofe 50 - 69: Racioc\u00ednio Lento Origem: Wikip\u00e9dia.\nCURSO DE RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA EXAME PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICO DETRAN admiss\u00e3o em empresas Lei de forma\u00e7\u00e3o da sequ\u00eancia\n http://youtu.be/1-kcySYYlDo", "title": "CURSO DE RACIOC\u00cdNIO L\u00d3GICO TESTE DE QI QUOCIENTE DE INTELIG\u00caNCIA EXAME  PSICOT\u00c9CNICO MATEM\u00c1TICA", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T09:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1-kkivsjbE0", "description": "Click here to subscribe: http://smarturl.it/PSBHQ \n\nTheme From PSB by Public Service Broadcasting.\n\nVideo produced & Directed by Robin Brunson (Hexstatic): http://vimeo.com/channels/robinbrunson\n\nJ.

More specifically, it describes a low pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the East Coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. The precipitation pattern is similar to other extratropical storms. Nor'easters also can cause coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane force winds, and heavy snow. Nor'easters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter season. Nor'easters can be devastating and damaging, especially in the winter months, when most damage and deaths are cold related, as nor'easters are known for bringing extremely cold air down from the Arctic air mass. Nor'easters thrive on the converging air masses; that is, the polar cold air mass and the warmer ocean water of the Gulf Stream.\nNor'easters will usually develop between 30 N. and 35 N. latitudes", "title": "Nor'Easter Hits Long Island N.Y.  10/18/09", "publishedDate": "2009-10-26T18:46:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1011idkz6A4", "description": "The 2014 Futuras include the very deep deck concave concept, the mini-wingers concept, the C3 designed Venom fins and open-angle cut-aways with heel extensions for extra stability at low speeds and class-leading top-end speeds across a mega-wide wind range...\n\nAnd for 2014, R\u00e9mi Vila introduces a new UV protecting blue finish on Carbon models as well as new fluorescent livery of the iSonics for a racier look!", "title": "Starboard 2014 Futura Action Video", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T08:06:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "101ERO9H8TY", "description": "You know those tiny plastic beads found in personal skin care products like facial scrubs and toothpaste? Microbeads are turning up in the tens of millions in the Great Lakes and they could be toxic.  The State Attorney General is leading the charge to ban them in New York. RIT's Kate Winnbeck was among those interviewed by WROC for the story.\n\nThe shelves in the cosmetic and personal skin care aisles are lined with products that contain microbeads.  They help with exfoliation and abrasion.  The beads eventually make their way into our water supply.  They are turning up in the tens of millions in the Great Lakes, including Lake Ontario.  Environmentalists say the beads become coated with toxins, eventually making their way up the food chain to our dinner tables.\n\n\"Fish are eating these little plastic beads.

James chapter 1 verse 3 says, 'Knowing this the trying of your faith works patience.'  The word 'patience' refers to a heroic endurance, a spiritual toughness and an unwavering perseverance. God often uses adversity to strengthen our faith but if our faith is going to be strengthened then we must persevere under adversity.\n\nI read recently a story that illustrates perseverance. A few years ago, a commuter flight left Portland, Maine to Boston, Massachusetts. The pilot, Henry Dempsey, heard an unusual noise at the back of the plane. He turned the controls over to his co-pilot and went back to investigate. As he reached the tail section, the plane hit an air pocket. Dempsey was tossed against the rear door and he quickly discovered the source of the mysterious noise. The rear door had not been properly latched prior to take-off and it flew open. He was instantly sucked out of the aeroplane. The co-pilot, seeing a red light that indicated an open door, radioed the nearest airport, requesting for permission to make an emergency landing. He reported that the pilot had fallen out of the plane and requested for a helicopter search of that area of the ocean. After the plane landed, they found Henry Dempsey holding on to the outside ladder of the aircraft. Somehow, he had caught the ladder, held on for 10 minutes as the plane flew 200 miles an hour at 4000 feet. Then at the landing, he kept his head from hitting the runway. It took the airport personnel several minutes to pry Dempsey's fingers from the ladder, as you can well imagine. But you see that's perseverance. It is holding on and it is not giving up in the midst of your adversity. It is you enduring and not compromising, or caving in or giving in during your times of difficulties. And every time we endure adversity, God richly blesses us. In fact James tells us chapter 1 and verse 4, he says, 'Let patience have a perfect work that you might be mature and entire and wanting nothing.' In other words, our perseverance in faith brings the wonderful blessings of God. Maybe you're in the midst of a difficult situation right now, maybe you're worried about your financial situation, or you're struggling with a health issue, no matter how long or how hard that road, don't give up, don't give in, don't compromise your biblical principles or your Christian values. Because not only will God give you the strength to endure but your endurance will bring God's blessing.\n\nI read recently a page from the journal of John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church. And if anybody knew the blessings of perseverance, he did. His journal reads this way, 'On Sunday, a.m. on May the 5th,' he said, ' I preached at St. Anne's, was asked not to come back anymore.' That evening, he preached at St John 's, the deacon said 'Get out and stay out.' On May the 12th, in the a.m. service, he preached at St Jude's, he said, 'Can't go back there either'. In the evening, he preached at St George's, he said 'Kicked out again'. The next Sunday morning he preached at Saint somebody else's, the deacon called a special meeting and said 'I cannot return'. That evening, he preached out on the street, he was kicked off the street. The next Sunday morning, he preached out in the meadows. He was chased out of the meadows when a bull was turned loose during the service. The Sunday morning, he preached at the edge of town and he was kicked off the highway. But that evening, he preached in a pasture and 10,000 people came to hear the word of God. \n\nYou see, friends, adversity produces perseverance in faith. And perseverance in faith always brings the blessings of God. And my prayer for you is this, may the Spirit of God take the Word of God and change you with it today.\n\nhttp://www.mikeredick.org\nhttp://www.glcc-online.org\nhttp://www.facebook.com/evangelistmikeredick", "title": "Adversity Strengthens Your Faith", "publishedDate": "2012-01-05T09:19:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "104eF0gB3Lg", "description": "Intro of Zero Tolerance for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive", "title": "Genesis - Zero Tolerance Intro", "publishedDate": "2010-02-06T00:40:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "104tQfcK1sI", "description": "Falling through the sky with no way to land, the A-Team decides to fly the tank they are trapped in.", "title": "A-Team: Tank Flying", "publishedDate": "2013-05-09T17:36:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "105Tn7uTCIo", "description": "Becky Lou of Double Lung Outdoors takes down an Aoudad @ Cibolo Creek Ranch -  http://cibolocreekranch.com/index.htm Hunting with Kenneth Tallent, owner Tallent Roofing.http://www.tallentroofing.com/ -- Huge thanks to Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter, Resort Manager Mike Danella, Ranch Manager Robert Cavness, and \"Superman\" Cody Cavness who personally guided this hunt!", "title": "Aoudad for Becky Lou @ Cibolo Creek Ranch", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T13:21:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "10610QCO9Js", "description": "Good question, and an answer for it.

Cadmus, in search of his abducted sister Europa, settled in Boeotia, which some say he invaded with a Phoenician army, founding in this new land the city of Cadmea, later called Thebes. Cadmus is credited for having combined consonants with vowels, thus teaching the secrets of correct speech. These events took place approximately 00 years before the Trojan War \nThe Phoenicians who came with Cadmus introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, unknown to the Greeks. At first they used the same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their letters. \nAt that period most of the Greeks in the neighborhood were Ionians; they were taught these letters by the   Phoenicians and adopted them, with a few alterations,+++ for their own use, continuing to refer to them as the Phoenician characters\u2014as was only right, as the Phoenicians had introduced them\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEdinstveniot argument shto grcite go koristat e toa :  Aleksandra rekol deka e helen koga Atinianite  se pobunile protiv nego za da mu pomogne na Antipatro , a  Aleksandar  bil vo vojna so Persija  vo Persija  go trazhel Darij III   ,.....

The Brown thermal footage filmed via a thermal imager on October 30, 2013 by Jon, Sara and Ben Brown of Grays Harbor, Washington with the help of Derek Randles and The Olympic Project. Also, check out our interview with Jonathon Brown from yesterday, below:\n\nShawn Evidence: Hi Jonathan. Really impressive footage. When did you film it?\n\nJonathan Brown: Thank you. It was taken 3-4 weeks ago.\n\nShawn Evidence: How many people were with you that day, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nJonathan Brown: During the picture and the video, my brother Joel Brown. My wife was at the site not long before.\n\nShawn Evidence: Did you find any tracks when you checked the location?\n\nJonathan Brown: Yes. We cast a 16 1/2 inch print where he was standing.\n\nShawn Evidence: I was wondering if there are any more details you can give us to share about your footage. I think you have the best thermal footage any researcher can ever ask for. In summer of 2012, The Sierra Evidence Initiative team, Bart Cutino and I, recorded what we believe to be at least 2 sasquatches on thermal. I have to say, your footage is pretty amazing.\n\nJonathan Brown: I saw your footage a couple weeks ago, and loved it. When we filmed it we were unfamiliar with the flir, as we had only had it for a short period of time. We had the medium lens of the 3 on, and we didn't know about the zoom or how to adjust the lens for clarity. We also didn't know about the auto shut down or how to prevent it. It was 117 feet away, and I started browsing and took the first still. I didn't know how to record and my brother Joel brown, took the camera and figured out the record option and filmed the video. There were about 30 cows by us, and I was browsing them and when I saw the head, I thought it was probable that it was a bigfoot because the heat signature was so different. Through the view finder it was not nearly as clear as on the computer, and it wasn't until a few days later my wife pulled out the sd card. I was in another room playing my guitar and when I first saw the look on her face I thought someone died. I couldn't believe how good it ended up being. In the last year we have recorded 150 plus audio recordings of the wild men in the woods, and we have had 2 night time sightings of them and I had a daylight encounter. With that being said I wasn't in a hurry to watch what I thought was going to be a blurry blob that could have been a bigfoot.\n\nJonathan Brown: The audio with the parabolic began in September and that is where the majority of the audio is from. Prior we had a few taken from our iPhones.\n\nJonathan Brown: My wife Sara had contacted Derek Randles. After meeting him and David Ellis, we knew that it would be the perfect partnership. We brought them to the site, and walked them through the key areas, and our base camp where we do our general night observations. David Ellis set up his recording station with a parabolic microphone, and introduced my wife to a spectrographic analysis software program and worked together on the recordings. From there our site gained momentum.\n\nShawn Evidence: What an incredible find Jonathan. Do you mind if I post something about this conversion? I can just mention your first name and leave your last name out of you prefer to stay private.\n\nShawn Evidence: When was the last time you've been back?\n\nJonathan Brown: The location of the site is very secure, and nothing about our names will link anything or anyone to the location. I was at the site last night with Joel AKA Ben (goes by Middle name). I'm also not concerned of people thinking I'm crazy for what we share. What would be crazy is to deny what you know for fear of what others may think. That would be the mindset of a coward. The only thing I can say to the skeptics is that I'm sorry that you don't know what I do. If you don't believe that's you're issue, not mine. We believe in bigfoot the same way people believe in bears.\n\nShawn Evidence: Well said. I'm looking forward to sharing your story and investigation. Also, in the video that you filmed, how long is the video and how did the Bigfoot behave?\n\nJonathan Brown: I believe the raw footage is 4 minutes, and the raw and enhanced will be shared at the same time as long as Derek and the team agree. We talked with Derek, and we came to an understanding that we need the Olympic Project to release all evidence first, and then we can share individually. So I will get you a picture of the footprint after it goes through the Olympic Project. We have been doing the field work, but it's a team effort between Derek, Sara, Joel, David and myself. If any of us were out of the equation the project wouldn't be what it is and we share equal importance, just in different roles.\n\nShawn Evidence: Again. We appreciate you sharing your story with us, Jonathan.\n\nOriginal footage here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML7-lp1lRrU", "title": "Massive Bigfoot Caught on Thermal In Grays Harbor, WA", "publishedDate": "2013-12-14T20:24:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "10KoAkv9Y3U", "description": "", "title": "lordroah vs  enation sinikof.MPG", "publishedDate": "2010-05-09T12:44:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "10L-3WQ0Pok", "description": "Dermefface FX7 Review Video : http://bit.ly/13vU1Wf Click Link to Left and Fade Your Scars Like Magic!

There's also hydrolyzed soybean fiber and very notably, a biologically active form of vitamin B3 and darling of the natural skin brightening industry, niacinamide.\n\nThe beta glucan is an obvious choice because of its long history as an anti-irritant. But it's also an effective moisturizer and proven to stimulate natural production of collagen. Beta glucan also promotes health of macrophages -- the cells that destroy bacteria and remove dead or damaged skin cells.\n\nGetting back to that Pro-Coll-One+, we shouldn't forget that it's clinically proven to stimulate collagen by up to 1,190%. Combine that with the Symglucan, Pentavitin and several other active ingredients and Dermefface FX7 has the goods to stimulate healthy human collagen fibroblasts, slough off dead skin cells and encourage normal, healthier skin cells to take their place.\n\nResults\n\nA good set of ingredients is one thing, but it's all for naught if they don't work together and do what the manufacturer says it will do.\n\nFortunately, Dermefface FX7 comes with the Skinception name attached to its label, and as with most things Skinception, Dermefface delivers, in that it fades scars, according to the clients we've spoken with. And yes, it appears to work in as little as four weeks.\n\nDermefface FX7 markets itself as a treatment for both developing scars and those existing. Many clients using Dermefface use it for both of these reasons, and they've seen their scarring fade, though it tends to work better for a scar that's still forming. It appears to work for existing scars as well, however, with visible reduction where people want it most.\n\nThe clients who've talked with us say they're happy with the product - a non-greasy cream with a luxurious feel when applied to the skin.\nValue\n\nThe Skinception name offers plenty of value. As a general rule of thumb, the greatest savings with any Skinception product tend to be had with orders of three months or higher, often with gifts or extra product added as incentive to go long-term.\n\nWe think that's wise, because skin problems like stretch marks and scarring aren't fixed overnight. Skinception products show noticeable results in a reasonable amount of time, but the most dramatic improvements can take up to six months.\n\nSkinception offers a one month supply of Dermefface FX7 at $59.95. Not exactly a bargain, but when you consider the luxurious formulation of Skinception products, which most clients rave about, seems a reasonable purchase. This includes both a loofah and a microderm exfoliator.\n\nAs with most Skinception products, the best value is for a longer term commitment. The Gold Package is a three month supply of Dermefface FX7 , the two exfoliators and a $25 gift card to Natural Health Source. The cost? $129.95\n\nFor the most value with Dermefface FX7 , go for the Platinum Package, which is a six month supply, two microderm exfoliators and the loofah, the Natural Health Source gift card and a savings of $160 off a one month supply. The cost of the Platimum Package, at $199.95, is a very respectable value, and we think, should be viewed as an investment to visibly fade scarring with a proven product.\n\nWhere to buy Dermefface FX7 online ?

In this lesson I am going to show you how to form and when to use a past perfect, and how to from and when to use a past perfect continuous.\n\nNow let's get started. Take a look at these sentences:\nI had worked before I ate my breakfast.\nI had been working before I ate my breakfast.\n\nThe first sentence is in the past perfect tense.The second sentence is in the past perfect\ncontinuous tense. Now let's have a look at how to make a past perfect. We can make a past perfect for the regular verbs, by using the auxiliary verb to have but then\nthe past tense from which is had, and the past participle. Remember we can make a past participle by adding -ed to the base form of the verb.\nFor example:\n\nI had walked the dog.\n\nFor the irregular verbs we also use had and the past participle but here the past participle has a different form.\nShe had driven my car. (The infinitive form of the verb is to drive.)\nThe past perfect continuous is made with the auxiliary verb have,but then the past simple for which is had, the past participle of the verb 'to be' which is been,\nthe base form of the verb and ing.\nFor example\n\nI had been walking the dog and she had been driving my car.\nNow let's have a look at the difference between the two. We use the past perfect for verbs that express either an activity or a state,which started in the past before \nsomething else in the past so we have two things happening in the past but one\nbefore the other. For example:\n\nHe had talked on the phone before he started cooking\nI had broken my leg before I broke my arm.\n\nA past perfect continuous is used for an activity which started in the past before something else in the past, so only with activities. For example:\nI had been talking to him, before I sent that email.\nPlease note that we cannot use the verb 'to break' here.\nI thank you for your attention.", "title": "Past Perfect and Past Perfect Continuous (progressive)  - English grammar tutorial video lesson", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T12:04:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "10OTPTOTf6c", "description": "Serena Williams showing off her fantastic serve.

It causes a cough that often brings up mucus, as well as shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. \nThe same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or through physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis, but not as often as viruses.\nMost cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your healthcare provider.\nTreatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. You probably do not need antibiotics. They don't work against viruses - the most common cause of acute bronchitis. If your healthcare provider thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics.\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute", "title": "Acute Bronchitis - Causes, Symptoms, Treatments & More\u2026", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T22:11:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "10PMGuPCpCY", "description": "Check out the guys on the Starters talking to the Bucks promising young big man Giannis Antetokounmpo!\n\n\nAbout the NBA: \nThe NBA is the premier professional basketball league in the United States and Canada.

Since my picture is from when I was 15, I thought I'd take a new photo before renewing it. Maybe you can get some tips for your own ID photo, whether it's a license or passport picture that lasts a looooong time, or just your school ID that you get every year!\nMy main tip with ID photos is to not go too crazy with color or drama. I added lilac as a pop of color and to make my brown eyes stand out in the photo, but held back on my usual dramatic winged liner. I want the picture to be more timeless than anything, because who knows when the next time I'll re-take it will be! (You don't have to retake a picture when renewing your license, usually they just use whatever they have on file).\nAlso, another tip, I left my hair down because I usually wear it like this and I definitely advise against putting your hair up in an ID photo. It always looks like girls have no hair when they wear it in a ponytail.\n\nMusic: \nYoung Erotic Naughty People- Greg Gibbs\nOn!- Greg Gibbs\ncourtesy of FreeMusicArchive.org", "title": "Get Ready With Me: New ID Photo!
