But what's that exactly? Just like an actual footprint, it's a mark you leave upon the environment. No, not with your shoes but with every action that releases \"Carbons\". Those are the harmful gases, such as Co2, which are pumped out by burning fossil fuels, like oil or gas. And the more fuel is used, the bigger your footprint will be. You may think that by driving your car, the only carbons you release come from the engine, but no. Consider the carbons that are emitted just to get fuel into the tank: From the energy needed to extract the oil from underground, the pollution caused by transportation and refinement, to the final delivery to your local petrol station. Not to mention the Co2 released by manufacturing your car in the first place. More than you thought, eh? So unless you live in a cave; you and everything you own has it's own carbon footprint: Read a book -- Printing and distributing it uses energy. Brush your teeth and your tools will have a history in a factory. Even something as basic as an apple could have travelled hundreds or even thousands of miles to end up in your local supermarket. You see, it's pretty much impossible to leave no carbon footprint behind. But by thinking about your actions and personal choices, maybe you can make your feet just that little bit smaller and really help to put the boot into climate change. \n\nwww.simpleshow.com", "title": "simpleshow explains the Carbon Footprint", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T09:19:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8q7vXmXjOSw", "description": "Dr. Charles S Lee\nEnhance \u00ae Medical Center, Inc. \nhttp://www.asiancosmeticsurgery.com    310.271.5954\n\nFor more videos, subscribe to our Youtube channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/DrCharlesLee\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/drlee90210\n\nDon't forget to like us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/asianplasticsurgery\n\nYou can also subscribe now on Dr. Charles Lee's Facebook account.\nhttp://www.facebook.com/drlee90210\n\nFor more information and for your inquiries, you can check our website:\n\nhttp://www.enhanceplasticsurgery.com/ -or-\nhttp://www.asiancosmeticsurgery.com/\n\n\nBefore after photos here:\nhttp://blog.asiancosmeticsurgery.com/2009/08/21/video-of-asian-eyelid-nose-chin-and-buccal-cheek-fat-3-weeks-ago/\n\nWe'd love to hear from you!:)\n\ndrlee90210", "title": "[UPDATED] Asian Eyelid, Nose, Buccal Fat by Dr. Charles S.

The low pressure is caused by the centrifugal force from the rotation movement of the Earth which is most important at the equator, which makes the air rise and travel north and south high in the atmosphere, until it subsides again in the horse latitudes. Some of that air returns to the doldrums through the trade winds. This process can lead to light or variable winds and more severe weather, in the form of squalls, thunderstorms and hurricanes. The doldrums are also noted for calm periods when the winds disappear altogether, trapping sail-powered boats for periods of days or weeks. The term appears to have arisen in the 18th century \u2013 when cross-Equator sailing voyages became more common.\nColloquially, the \"doldrums\" are a state of inactivity, mild depression, listlessness or stagnation.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Doldrums", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T15:45:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qG0j38LiZ4", "description": "PSV ontspannen op weg naar Panathinaikos.", "title": "Dolle boel op de training", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T18:47:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qG4phGQ3to", "description": "", "title": "d other", "publishedDate": "2013-03-20T13:38:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qGhT1_aJQw", "description": "Isaac's Dictionary 5 parts - vines by: Rudy Mancuso\n\n1.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "What Causes Eczema and What Can Be Done About It", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T10:25:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qHGwNPma9o", "description": "Welcome to AutoMotoTube!!!

The whale who thought he could fly: Amazing moment humpback is captured leaping out of the water (and even manages a wave)\n\nThese jaw-dropping images show the moment a humpback whale leapt majestically from the ocean, 'waving' to a tourist boat before crashing back down with an almighty splash.\nThe photos, taken off the coast of South Africa by marine tour guide Steven Benjamin, captured a sight rarely seen at such close proximity.\nThe 40 ton humpback put on an incredible aerial display, soaring through the air just yards from a boat as shocked onlookers screamed. \nThe 31-year-old, who was documenting the migration of more than 1,000 whales from the coast of South Africa to the warmer waters of Mozambique and Madagascar, watched as the whale flopped around in the ocean.\nMr Benjamin thought the humpback's show was over after 20 minutes hiding deep under water, but it suddenly lifted ts entire body out of the water, extending a fin to onlookers before slamming back down, creating a huge splash.\nThe giant creature was clearly having a whale of a time as the marine tour guide watched from the safety of a boat off Port St John, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.\nThe spectacular display of strength and agility 'blew away' Mr Benjamin, who had never before managed to get so close to a humpback.\nMr Benjamin said: 'Huge whale breaches like this are common to see quickly from a distance, but it is exceptionally rare to have it occur close to the boat and have the camera ready.\n'I got this shot out of sheer luck. We were focused on this whale whilst it was doing normal tail slapping and half head flops. \n'It took a rest for 20 mins and then without notice or warning, it did a single massive breach.'\nHe added: 'I was stunned. I've never seen such a huge, front on and high breach like that. The whole boat erupted in screams as it landed.'\nMr Benjamin, from Cape Town, only started taking pictures of marine life six years ago. \nThe amateur snapper won his camera in a local photography competition, allowing him to capture bigger and better shots. \nHe added: 'People can't believe its a real image, everyone always looks twice and are blown away by it.' \nThe acrobatic animals can grow up to 50ft long, and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons.\nHumpback whales were almost hunted to extinction during the 1960s, but a ban has allowed their global population to reach approximately 80,000. \n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2779320/Amazing-moment-humpback-whale-thought-flying-fish-Ocean-giant-captured-leaping-water-managing-wave.html", "title": "Watch a giant humpback whale attempt to fly", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T23:23:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qIcQYj5Vc0", "description": "This might not be the conventional way you make a salad, but it is a flavorful deviation from the norm.\n \nHere is what you will need:\nSome Type of Grill\nHead Romaine Lettuce\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\nCoarse Salt\nBlack Pepper\nGarlic Powder\nThree Cheese Blend (Asiago, Parmesan & Romano)\n \nRinse and dry your head of lettuce, then remove the big floppy outer leaves.

Amongst many other black projects, a team of British scientists working at an Infinitum Research experimental station stumbled across some remarkable phenomena involving DNA manipulation. This led to deeper research with dangerously unpredictable results, often leading to human patients losing their lives in irresponsible and immoral experiments.\n\nTime passed on, and by the mid 1990s the failure rate of the experiments had been reduced from 75% to a mere 15%, enough for Infinitum to move onto the next stage: Biological Light Refraction. The British team were hoping to unravel the possibilities of light manipulation to create the perfect covert military agent. Early into the new millennium, due to a gross miscalculation, a series of tests on Subject 617 led to a massive synaptic trauma leaving the patient with multiple genetic anomalies.\n\nThe subject was left in constant pain and with unstable DNA. The subject escaped captivity, killing anyone that got in its way. The I.R.I.S. (Infinitum Research Interception Squad) team have been deployed to return the subject to a maximum security Infinitum Research facility for further study and dissection. The entire project was considered a failure: all funding ceased and development was discontinued while all records and traces of the experiments were destroyed. Infinitum Research denies all knowledge of any form of human DNA manipulation but are more than happy to comment on the possibilities of cloning human organs inside suitable animal donors. It is believed that these organ cloning experiments form the main cover for their human genetic manipulation experimentations.\n\nSubject 617, known as 'The Hidden', must turn the tables and become the hunter instead of the hunted as the I.R.I.S. team close their net around him.\"\n\nEnjoy the video?

Their second LP, Biker, is set for worldwide release via Aarght Records on October 31st.\n\nBiker unleashes seven slabs of free-form guitar and ecstatic No Wave atonality atop giant churning bass and thundering motorik drums, with the occasional slice of quotidian automatic poetry. The rhythm section of bassist Jensen Tjhung (Deaf Wish, Lower Plenty) and drummer Per Bystr\u00f6m (Ooga Boogas, Leather Towel) display a mantra-like devotion to repetition that goes beyond rock genre moves into zones of pure intensity, anchoring the band\u2019s blown-out epics with pummelling lock grooves as vocalist/guitarist Duncan Blachford dispenses riotous improvised six-string sizzle in a style that synthesises classic post-Hendrix psych and the reverb/delay clouds of the Mizutani/Haino tradition with the amplified-plank-of-wood rawness of Bruce Russell. Recorded in gristly no-frills fidelity at the band\u2019s own studio, Biker is a high-potency emission from the deepest reaches of the Melbourne underground.", "title": "EXHAUSTION - Pure Duty", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T04:00:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qOQ_wDFZeU", "description": "Watch more How to Drive videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/500643-How-to-Start-and-Stop-Smoothly-Driving-Lessons\n\nPick up four driving tips for first time drivers in this Howcast video with A-Club Driving School.\n\n\nSo today we want to talk about the subject of first time driving tips. What is important to learn when we first start our driving? And I feel that the most important thing is speed control. We want to have the ability to accelerate and to brake in a nice, calm, smooth manner. So the first time we get in the car, we want to be able to get a feel for the accelerator. We want to realize that you don't have to press too hard on that accelerator to get that car to start to accelerate. It's a nice, smooth touch on the accelerator, and the same thing with the brake. We want to have a nice, easy touch on the brake so that we can stop the car and accelerate the car in a nice, smooth manner.\n\nThe other thing is our hand position when we're driving. It's nice, soft hands are very important in learning to drive. We don't want a death grip on that wheel. We want nice, soft hands, like pretty much anything that you do in sports, your hands have to be nice and soft. If your hands are soft and you're not real tense, you'll find that you have the ability to steer a car much, much better.\n\nYou also want to be able to get the big picture when we're driving. We don't want to stare at anything because when you drive, you will follow your eyes. Okay? So if you're looking to the right or you're looking to the left and you're staring at that portion of the vehicle, that's the way the vehicle will move. When people drive a car for the first time, they have a difficult ability to understand how far they are away from the vehicle to the right, and that's because the right side of the vehicle is a little further away from you than the left. So invariably what they usually do is they stare down to the right side, and what happens when you stare to the right, your car will go to the right. So you want to pick your eyes up. You want to keep your eyes ahead of you looking out ahead and you'll find that you follow your eyes. So if your eyes are straight ahead the car will have a better chance of going straight. \n\nSo again, we want our acceleration and our braking to be nice and smooth. So, the first thing you want to do is get in your car, realize you don't have to press real hard on those pedals to get the car to stop and to get the car to accelerate smoothly. The first time in, get used to the pedals, then get used to your steering, nice smooth hands, nice soft hands will give you the ability to control the vehicle the best. Then, you want to look straight ahead. Remember, you're going to follow your eyes, so you don't want to be staring left or right because that's the way the car's going to go. If you keep your eyes ahead, you'll have a much better chance of going straight.", "title": "4 First Time Tips | Driving Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T20:25:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qOcqcpyBlg", "description": "An experiment, trying to do stop motion animation with a new program, first attempt.", "title": "ChenChen Trying to Walk", "publishedDate": "2007-07-13T12:34:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qOi9cbJfkY", "description": "Local knowledge pays off for William Lloyd and family who were at Mangonui Wharf at 5am catching live baits and fishing for kingies.

In n\u00f6rdlicher Richtung ist der M\u00e4usedorn bis nach England zu finden. Der Stechende M\u00e4usedorn ist ein kleinw\u00fcchsiger, immergr\u00fcner Strauch, der gerne im Unterholz von Geb\u00fcschen und W\u00e4ldern w\u00e4chst. Die harten, mit einer stechenden Spitze versehenen, blattartigen Kurztriebe des M\u00e4usedorns bilden ein schwer durchdringbares Gestr\u00fcpp. Die eigentlichen Bl\u00e4tter dieser Heilpflanze sind auf kleine Schuppen reduziert. Die Bl\u00fcten und die roten Beeren findet man auf der Oberseite der Kurztriebe einzeln oder zu wenigen vereint in der Achsel eines Hochblattes. Der Stechende M\u00e4usedorn passt sich der Trockenheit an, Frost vertr\u00e4gt die Pflanze aber nicht.\n\nF\u00fcr den traditionell hergestellten \"F\u00fcnfwurzelsirup\" verwendete man M\u00e4usedorn (Ruscus aculeatus L.), Spargel, Attich (Sambucus ebulus L.), Wilden Fenchel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) und Petersilie.\n\nDie heilkr\u00e4ftige Wirkung des M\u00e4usedorns war schon dem altgriechischen Arzt Dioskurides bekannt. Benutzt werden die Kurztriebe (Phyllokladien) und der schiefe, knotige, schwach nach Terpentin riechende Wurzelstock. Er soll harntreibend, fiebersenkend und vor allem auf das Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfsystem tonisch wirken, mehr noch als die ebenfalls in der Naturheilkunde verwendete Rosskastanie.\n\nDer strauchig wachsende M\u00e4usedorn erreicht eine Wuchsh\u00f6he von 30 bis 90 cm. Der Strauch ist dicht mit blatt\u00e4hnlichen, dunkelgr\u00fcnen, lederigen, wechselst\u00e4ndig angeordneten, sitzenden, eif\u00f6rmigen und in eine stechende Spitze auslaufenden Kurztrieben (Phyllokladien) bewachsen. Die Bl\u00fctezeit des Stechenden M\u00e4usedorns erstreckt sich von September bis April. Die violett oder gr\u00fcnlich gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fcten stehen einzeln oder zu zweit in der Achsel eines kleinen Hochblattes, etwa in der Mitte der Phyllokladien. Die rundlichen, reifen Beeren des M\u00e4usedorns sind rot gef\u00e4rbt. Der schiefe Wurzelstock ist hellgrau, knotig und mit br\u00e4unlichen Wurzeln besetzt. Der Geruch der Wurzeln ist schwach terpentinartig. Der Geschmack des Stechenden M\u00e4usedorns ist erst s\u00fc\u00dflich, sp\u00e4ter bitter.\nStandort / Hier findet man den Stechenden M\u00e4usedorn\n\nDer M\u00e4usedorn w\u00e4chst in S\u00fcd- und Westeuropa. Die Pflanze bevorzugt W\u00e4lder, Geb\u00fcsche und Waldr\u00e4nder mit kalkreichen B\u00f6den.

Other artists paid 2 pounds 30 shillings. Then again it was not a spruced-backed, maple-necked piece of craftsmanship -- it was a beat up old box!   \n\n1935 -- Age 10, Athol was playing piano at local dances. When he left school he worked on his father's farm and then as a farmhand on neighbouring properties. It was the guitar, the Tex Morton and Wilf Carter music that claimed his attention.\n\n1947 -- Age 22, his first break came when he was asked to sing on a radio program on 7AD Devonport. The program was on Tuesday nights and ran for three and a quarter years.\n\n1950 -- Moved to  Melbourne to expand his range of opportunities.  Won his heat of  Australia's Amateur Hour in 1950 and recorded for EMI.\n\n1951 -- Won the novelty section on the 'prestigious' radio show  P & A Parade.\n\nThis win brought him fairly constant work in radio and live performances but not a great deal of progress.\n\n1951-1958 -- He worked as a barman in Connell's  Railway Hotel.\n\n1956 -- He topped the poll on Terry Dear's  Australia's  Amateur Hour with over 10,000 votes.\n\nOn the strength of that success, he went to  Sydney for an audition with Regal Zonophone and was accepted. The first track he recorded Wilf Carter's 'Swiss Moonlight Lullaby' and his own composition 'Tassie Tears'. The recordings made him the first Tasmanian to sing from the magic grooves! Sales warranted more records.\n\n1956 & 1958 -- Puts down 4 additional tracks each year.\n\nAn outcome of the recording contract was an offer of a promotional tour of eastern states on Noel George's 'Australian Wild West Show'. The show also featured American Indian Wrestler Big Chief Little Wolf. Other tours for Athol at this time were also with the 'Reg Lindsay Show, Chad Morgan and Rick and Thel Shows'.\n\n1961 -- By the time he organised his own travelling show the best days for this type of entertainment had passed on the mainland. They were hard times for travelling shows. Nearly all the shows went bust. Athol headed back to  Tasmania.\n\n1966 -- Athol toured full time again.  He teamed up with his boyhood idol 'Tex Morton' with a show called The Morton's and McCoy's\n\nThe tour started in Morven QLD, through to the Isa, across to Alice Springs, back through the settlements to  Darwin where they did a three-week season showing nightly, across the  Kimberley's down to  Western Australia and across the Nullarbor.\n\nAfter the  Tex shows ended, he toured with Terry Gordon, Ray Haselar Lindsay Butler and others.\n\nBack in  Sydney he recorded for RCA with Eileen Wood on fiddle who also toured with him and then became Mrs Athol McCoy\".\n\n1969 -- At the end of the year, he had a break from touring and gained a job with the Reserve Bank in  Melbourne.\n\n1972-1973 -- He made his last tour of  Australia.\n\n1973 -- Hadley Records in  Tamworth acquired the rights to most of Athol's recorded output and issued an album of his work.\n\nAthol and Eileen settled in Bega NSW and had their own business.  They also worked clubs occasionally as the 'Real McCoy's' duo.\n\n1980 -- Inducted into the  Hands of Fame in  Tamworth.\n\n1996 -- June 6 Athol passed away in  Bega Hospital.\n\n2005 -- Inducted to the Australian Country Music Roll of Renown", "title": "Athol McCoy - Darling Nellie Gray", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T10:32:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qV7g3q0SLA", "description": "kumbe mwanadada Elizabeth Michael a.k.a Lulu ni asali yao baada ya kugombakiw huko mwanza na kundinla wanaume....\nvia... www.tza1961.blogspot.com", "title": "Lulu akigombaniwa na wanaume huko mwanza", "publishedDate": "2014-04-07T20:30:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qVV8A7KA7o", "description": "Participacion Neyko", "title": "NEYKO PARA BALEARIC FREESTYLE CUP", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T00:46:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qWgkOFaGqk", "description": "Bihu dance (Assamese: \u09ac\u09bf\u09b9\u09c1 \u09a8\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09af) is a folk dance from the Indian state of Assam related to the festival of Bihu.

Accordingly, he placed the circuit board layouts for the IP with a commercial circuit board company and freely published schematics and other documentation.\n\n\nThe IP is a general-purpose patch programmable analogue computer, which is different from a regular digital computer, and is optimized to process video/television signals and sound. The video is processed through the IP \"live\" so that the viewer is able to see the effect on video signals. Initially the video is B&W, at the end Sandin debuts the 'Color IP'.\n\nMore information can be found on the EVL website -- http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&type=1&indi=337", "title": "5 Minute Romp thru the IP", "publishedDate": "2007-12-13T19:56:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qhfyc04too", "description": "BAT MELECH - KING'S DAUGHTER - HIJA DE REY (\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea - \u05d1\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05da) HAIM YISRAEL\n\nSubtitled and Transliterated by:\nTransliterado y Subtitulado por:\nEl\u00ed Sha\u00fal Ben Abvraham //// Email:aridder@engineer.com\nrecuerda comentar /// remember comment", "title": "BAT MELECH - KING'S DAUGHTER - HIJA DE REY (\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea - \u05d1\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05da) HAIM YISRAEL", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T03:24:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qhh-0uG3QU", "description": "Installing the Krebs Custom Mk VI Enhanced Safety Selector Lever. As stated in the video, this is very basic stuff however, there are new gun owners every minute these days and this video is for those (like myself) that didn't know how to do it and had to look it up. I like the Krebs safety, in reading a lot of reviews the biggest gripe was that the lever itself was too loose and had to be bent in order for it to snap into place and stay there. The lever I have did not need any bending and seems to work fine. For those of you that shoot at a range requiring inspections during line breaks, this safety lever will make your life just a little easier. Are there any other or better AK safety levers out there? I'm sure there might be, but I like the Krebs Custom Mk VI Enhanced Safety Selector Lever just fine.

Cone opsins, employed in color vision, are less-stable opsins located in the cone photoreceptor cells. Cone opsins are further subdivided according to their absorption maxima (\u03bbmax), the wavelength at which the highest light absorption is observed. Evolutionary relationships, deduced using the amino acid sequence of the opsins, are also frequently used to categorize cone opsins into their respective group. Both methods predict four general cone opsin groups in addition to rhodopsin.[6]\n\nReal Science:\nRepresentation of molecular steps in photoactivation (modified from Leskov et al., 2000). Depicted is an outer membrane disk in a rod. \nStep 1: Incident photon (h\u03bd) is absorbed and activates a rhodopsin by conformational change in the disk membrane to R*. \nStep 2: Next, R* makes repeated contacts with transducin molecules, catalyzing its activation to G* by the release of bound GDP in exchange for cytoplasmic GTP, which expels its \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits. \nStep 3: G* binds inhibitory \u03b3 subunits of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activating its \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. \nStep 4: Activated PDE hydrolyzes cGMP.\nStep 5: Guanylyl cyclase (GC) synthesizes cGMP, the second messenger in the phototransduction cascade. Reduced levels of cytosolic cGMP cause cyclic nucleotide gated channels to close preventing further influx of Na+ and Ca2+.\nVisual phototransduction\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_phototransduction\nA photoreceptor cell is a specialized type of neuron\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell\n\nMore Real Science:\nHumans have the following set of photoreceptor proteins responsible for vision:\nRhodopsin (Rh1, OPN2, RHO) -- expressed in rod cells, used in night vision\nThree cone opsins (also known as photopsins) -- expressed in cone cells, used in color vision \nLong Wavelength Sensitive (OPN1LW) Opsin -- \u03bbmax in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum\nMiddle Wavelength Sensitive (OPN1MW) Opsin -- \u03bbmax in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum\nShort Wavelength Sensitive (OPN1SW) Opsin -- \u03bbmax in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum", "title": "Perfect Molecule for Vision Shows Eyes Were Designed", "publishedDate": "2011-12-05T18:18:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qmfmbLfG0I", "description": "Zsid\u00f3 temet\u0151ben tal\u00e1ltak r\u00e1 a Gestapo vezet\u0151j\u00e9nek holttest\u00e9re.

En 1871 su familia se traslada a Odesa. De 1886 a 1889 estudia Leyes en Mosc\u00fa. En 1896 rechaza un puesto docente en la Universidad de Dorpat para estudiar Arte en M\u00fanich.\nEn 1901 funda el grupo Phalanx, cuyo prop\u00f3sito principal es introducir las vanguardias francesas en el provinciano ambiente muniqu\u00e9s, para lo cual abre una escuela en la que da clases. Sus pinturas de los primeros a\u00f1os del siglo son paisajes ejecutados con esp\u00e1tula, en un principio sombr\u00edos, para luego adquirir una intensidad casi fauve; tambi\u00e9n pint\u00f3 temas fant\u00e1sticos basados en tradiciones rusas o en la Edad Media alemana; este per\u00edodo est\u00e1 marcado por la experimentaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica, en particular, en el uso del temple sobre un papel oscuro, para dar una impresi\u00f3n de superficie transparente, iluminada desde atr\u00e1s. La consistencia tonal del claroscuro enfatiza el esquema borrando la distinci\u00f3n entre las figuras y el fondo, resultando una composici\u00f3n casi abstracta.\n\nEn 1902 expone por primera vez con la Secession de Berl\u00edn y realiza sus primeras xilograf\u00edas. En 1903 y 1904 viaja por Italia, Pa\u00edses Bajos, \u00c1frica y visita Rusia. En 1904 expone en el Sal\u00f3n de Oto\u00f1o de Par\u00eds.\nEn 1909 es elegido presidente de la Nueva Asociaci\u00f3n de Artistas de M\u00fanich (NKVM). La primera exposici\u00f3n del grupo tiene lugar en la galer\u00eda Thannhauser de M\u00fanich ese mismo a\u00f1o. Hacia el final de la d\u00e9cada, las pinturas de Kandinski denotan una gran tendencia a la plenitud por la equivalencia en intensidad de las \u00e1reas de color y la superficie reluciente que destruye toda ilusi\u00f3n de profundidad. Las series de cuadros de jinetes en combate comienzan en 1909 y, en ellas, la l\u00ednea del horizonte se va erradicando gradualmente, al igual que otras referencias espaciales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosters by Wassily Kandinsky in high quality from $6.99: http://goo.gl/7SswJ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo:.wikipedia.org\n\nMusica:www.mutopiaproject.org/", "title": "Wassily Kandinsky 3D", "publishedDate": "2012-02-04T01:11:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qnnlhL-i6c", "description": "MisTeRGaMiNg24 and MisTeR24241 check them out. :)", "title": "My Player NBA 2K12 Sexy Layup", "publishedDate": "2011-12-22T03:59:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qnpV0fiu9E", "description": "vinst! \u00e4lskar dig fina ponnyn", "title": "Birr Castle Queen och Elvira hoppar LA", "publishedDate": "2012-06-19T08:42:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8qo5R-NTNqc", "description": "La for\u00eat de Rohanne qui doit \u00eatre saccager pour y  construie un ... a\u00e9roport !!!

In a century-old home in the centre of the city, twelve young Syrians from across the country rent rooms, having moved to the capital in pursuit of studies or professional ambition after the insurgency broke out in the countryside. Huddled within the confines of the elegant house as the uprising gradually erupts in the city, they can no longer ignore the calls for freedom. Conceived as a huis clos, Ladder to Damascus is a captivating window into the psyche of ordinary Syrians grappling with a historic upheaval.\n\nA veteran of Syrian cinema and one of the most accomplished Arab graduates of Moscow's VGIK film school, Mohamad Malas resurrects the ghosts of the chilling legacy of his country's thirty-year-old dictatorship as vividly as the clamouring in the streets. Gorgeously filmed by Joude Gorani and magnificently edited by Ayhan Ergursel, the film confronts the question of cinema's role in times of turmoil, employing its own unique visual language. It also draws, sparingly, on allegory \u2014 in image and dialogue \u2014 to lattice the complex existential questions that hound both its characters and its author.\n\nBeginning with an homage to the late Omar Amiralay, a fearless Syrian dissident and documentary filmmaker, Ladder to Damascus concludes that emancipation can only spring from love, and revolution from desire.

Now, Revealed Recordings pays its dues to the influential sound with the first of its dedicated remix packages favouring the harder side of electronic dance music, revisiting some of the label\u2019s biggest hits alongside a host of luminary talents from the hardstyle arena. Dutch duo Audiotricz kick things off with a brave re-imagining of Hardwell\u2019s crossover hit \u201cDare You,\u201d turning the Matthew Koma-voiced anthem into a high-octane rave tune of the highest calibre. While Swedish genre evangelists Wasted Penguinz give Joey Suki & Kill The Buzz\u2019s \u201cLife Is Calling\u201d a notable kick in tempo and stamina, Hard Driver and Substance One give the seminal Revealed instrumental \u2018The Code\u2019 a seamless transition into the infamous genre\u2019s remits with maximal impact. Jay Cosmic closes things off with an emotively building and heavily climatic finale, topping off a whirlwind insight into the versatility of hardstyle and its mass appeal here in 2014.\n\nDownload Revealed Recordings presents The Hardstyle Remixes EP now on Beatport: http://bit.ly/HardstyleEP\n\nFor more info check:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/jaycosmic/info\nhttp://www.twitter.com/jaycosmic\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/jay-cosmic\n\nhttp://www.wandwmusic.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/wandwofficial\nhttp://www.twitter.com/wandwmusic\n\nhttp://www.blasterjaxx.com \nhttp://www.twitter.com/Blasterjaxx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlasterjaxxOfficial\n\nhttp://www.revealedrecordings.com\nhttp://facebook.com/revealedrecordings\nhttp://twitter.com/revealedrec", "title": "W&W & Blasterjaxx - Rocket (Jay Cosmic Remix) [OUT NOW!] [4/4]", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T11:10:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rIB4thK-po", "description": "chansons", "title": "Si t'es une petite patate", "publishedDate": "2008-02-03T20:28:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rI_Y212LkE", "description": "Escalade \u00e0 Fontainebleau au bas-cuvier ( secteur-Bas ) sur la voie \" Nescaf\u00e9\" note 6A\nfilm\u00e9 avec JVC adixxion 2 puis encod\u00e9 en mp4", "title": "Escalade \u00e0 Fontainebleau au bas-cuvier sur Nescaf\u00e9 en 6A", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T19:49:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rIw8Rw4Kgg", "description": "by Hunter Ewen      www.hunterewen.com\n\nA movement from a recent fixed media composition entitled ELEMENTS.  This represents my first attempt at a fixed video piece.  After working on Gi\u2022nt's Eye (giant's eye was a real time, improvisatory piece I worked on last year), I wanted to compose something that was easy and portable.  After the premiere at CU Boulder's Atlas Black Box, I decided to reduce the surround sound audio to stereo and upload to youtube.\n\nThere are seven movements overall, as well as an introduction movement and animated menus.  Crescendo, Fermata, Staccato, Trill, Slur, Sforzando, and Decresdendo.  I performed as a vocalist, pianist, toy pianist, saxophonist, percussionist, and guitarist.  Other performers include Andrew Halladay (guitar), Anthony Green (piano), Emma Shubin (flute), Anna Seda (cello), Greg Simon (trumpet)\n\nFor those of you curious (if you couldn't tell just by watching and listening), the video was composed using 3D Studio Max, Final Cut Studio, Photoshop, After Effects (Trapcode Particular in particular), Processing, and Jitter.  The audio was composed in Finale, ProTools, Digital Performer, Logic, Reason, Max/MSP.  Some of the still images in the Sforzando movement are from royalty free horror websites, and a few of the choir sounds and explosions in the introduction and decrescendo movements are from a royalty free audio source.\n\nPlease enjoy, and let me know what you think.  Like I said, this is my first attempt at a fixed media piece, so I'd appreciate any compliments or constructive criticism!

I think it was about $125.00 range. I cut in to the sheetrock and built in the system with the DVD player. It really sits in the closet of the bathroom now. Sure the Watts. are low on this low cost system, but really how much sound does one require for a master bedroom? - Anyways I cut the sheetrock and ran the wires behind the wall, then under the baseboards. I put the sub wof. under the bed. On a scale of 1- 10 I give this low cost project a 9 1/2 due to the simple fact that it looks very custom, did not cost any money, and give a great sound for pennies on the dollar. Patching the sheetrock from running the wires was the hardest part, and was took more time rather than hard work. \nThis is proof that you can have a surround system that wont break your pocket book. Hope this helps, and remember that you can always purchase one or two steps above the low cost unit that I have and be happy.

It's quite interesting to see a tarantula making sounds, never knew this species made such sounds, so it is a pleasant surprise and a welcome addition to my spider's raw nature. The cockroach is quickly taken away literally from its last straw of hope (00:50), to be devoured privately in my spider's magnificent tunnels (01:25), you can see its booty webbing the poor roach near the end of the video (01:43). And a few final shots of the whole spider out its burrow (02:30). Very enjoyable tarantula so far!

Dyanna Spa has been offering this waxing service in Manhattan, N.Y. long before the term was first coined in the '80s.\n\nUsing great discretion, our experienced esthetician applies the wax from outside and inside the bikini line, including the vaginal lips and labia, and in between the buttocks, if desired. She then applies paper strips over the waxed areas, and quickly pulls off the strips and all the unwanted hair.\n\nWe have a strict \"no double dipping\" policy. Our esthetician uses the applicator once, and then discards it.

Today, let's talk about mood.\n \nWalter Burns: 365 days in a year and this has to be the day.\n \nWhat moods?\nInterrogative\nImperative\nSubjunctive\n \nHildy: That's what I thought. Come on, I'm in a hurry\n \nLet's start with the Imperative Mood. It is used for two things: Orders and Requests.\n \nWalter Burns: Go on, take it. Work for somebody else.\n \nReporter: Give me the desk\nReporter2: Give me the phone\nWalter Burns: Get back in there you mock-turtle\n \nVerbs in the Imperative mood are always in the present tense.\n \nSherriff: Speak up! Speak up!\nHildy: Yes, go on. Smear it all over the front page.\nWalter Burns: Listen, I made a great reporter out of you Hildy. But you won't be half as good on any other paper and you know it. (Meaningless Squabble).\nHildy: Sold! To the American\n \nGuess who? Guess What? Guess how? Should be: Guess who. Guess What. Guess how. Because they are all imperative.\n \n \nWalter Burns; Now look here you-- She hung up! What did I say?\n \nLet's go to the Interrogative.\nIt is used for one thing: Questions\n \nHildy's Mother in Law: What' sin there?\nWalter Burns: Who are you?\nHildy's Mother in Law: What are you doing?\nWalter: Who is she?\n \nSherriff: You mean me?\nWalter Burns: Yes you. What do you mean by breaking in here like this -- hmm?\n \nHildy: Is there anything you remember? Anything in particular?\n \nCommands in the Imperative mood often come off as harsh. Changing commands into questions can soften them, making them more polite.\nFor example, \"give me one,\" becomes: \"Oh, may I have one of those?\"\n \nSometimes the difference is subtle. \"Let her alone,\" becomes, \"Let her alone, will you, buddy?\"\n \nLastly, let's talk about the Subjunctive Mood. It is used for: Wishes, Hopes, Hypothetical Situations, and anything contrary to fact.\n \nWalter Burns: What's the idea here?\n \nWishing something means it either: \nA. Hasn't happened yet\nB. Isn't true\n \nHypothetical Situations such as: \"If I were Santa...\" are untrue (and subjunctive) because you are not Santa\n \nHildy: I don't blame you Earl. If I were you, I wouldn't trust anybody either.\n \nNote that it is always; \"If I were,\" not \"If I was.\"\n \nHildy: That was the one we were to have right after the honeymoon. \n \nWalter: Now look here, madam, be honest. If you were out joy-riding, plastered, or got into some scrape, why don't you admit it instead of accusing innocent people?\n \nThis is because in the subjunctive, the verb \"to be\" becomes \"Be\" in the present tense (if I be). \"Were\" in most other tenses (If I were). Verbs that insist upon something different than reality often attract the subjunctive mood: as if, if, pray, hope that.\n \nWalter: If you'd have been a gentlemen you would have forgotten all about it. But not you--\n \nFor the present tense, use the infinitive of the verb (without the to). Ex: run, see, think.\n \nPast tense verbs remain in the past tense indicative form. Ex: ran, see, think.\n \nNow, how can you use this?\n \nEarl: Everything should be made use of.\nHildy: Makes a lot of sense doesn't it?\nEarl: Yes.\n \nYour writing will become more dynamic, more powerful, when you vary the moods inside your writing. So what are you waiting for? Get writing!\n \nThe end.", "title": "Mood - Subjunctive, Interrogative, Imperative (captions)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-03T16:57:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rWNvgzCh2A", "description": "by DR TAHIR A SIDDIQUI ( consultant sonologist )\nGujranwala.

The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor, but its foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.\n\nThe island has been inhabited since before 6500 BC. As one of the six Celtic nations, Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD, and the Manx language, a branch of the Gaelic languages, gradually emerged. In 627, Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia. In the 9th century, the Norse began to settle there. Norse people from Scotland then established the Kingdom of the Isles. The King's title would then carry the suffix, \"and the Isles\". Magnus III, the King of Norway, was also known as \"King of Mann and the Isles\" as part of the Hebrides civilization between 1099 and 1103. A Norse-Gaelic culture arose and the island came under Norse control. In 1266, the island became part of Scotland, as formalised by the Treaty of Perth. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England, the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399. The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the kingdom of Great Britain or its successor the United Kingdom, retaining its status as an internally self-governing Crown dependency.\n\nThe Isle of Man is Manx: Ellan Vannin, where ellan is a Manx word meaning island. The earliest form of Man is Manu or Mana, which appears in the genitive case as Vaninn, hence Ellan Vannin \"Island of Man\".\n\nThe name Mana/u is related to the figure of Celtic mythology known as Manann\u00e1n mac Lir to the Irish and Manawydan to the Welsh.\n\nThe name enters recorded history as Mona (Julius Caesar, 54 BC), and is also recorded as Monapia or Monabia (Pliny the Elder, AD 77), Mon\u0153da (Ptolemy, AD 150), Mevania or M\u00e6navia (Orosius, AD 416), and Eubonia or Eumonia by Irish writers. Welsh records it as Manaw, and in the Sagas of Icelanders it is M\u00f6n.\n\nThough the Isle of Man was never incorporated into the Roman Empire, the island was noted in the Classics where it was called variously Monapia, M\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1 (Monaoida), M\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (Monarina), Menavi and Mevania. The Old Welsh and Old Irish names for the Isle of Man, Manau and Mano, also occur in Manaw Gododdin, the name for an ancient district in north Britain along the lower Firth of Forth.[13] The name is probably connected with the Welsh name of the island of Anglesey, Ynys M\u00f4n[14] and possibly with the Celtic root reflected in Welsh mynydd, Breton menez, and Scottish Gaelic monadh,[14] all of which mean \"mountain\" and probably derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *men-, \"to tower\".[15] In this case, such a name may have referred to the island apparently rising out of the Irish Sea on the horizon.\n\nRising water levels cut off the island from the surrounding islands around 8000 BC. Evidence suggests that colonisation of the island took place by sea some time before 6500 BC. The first residents lived in small huts, hunting, fishing and gathering their food. They used small tools made of flint or bone, examples of which have been found near the coast. Representatives of these artefacts are kept at the Manx Museum.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Isles about the year 1100. Sodor and Mann in red.\nThe Neolithic Period marked the coming of knowledge of farming, better stone tools and pottery. It was during this period that megalithic monuments began to appear around the island. Examples from this period can be found at Cashtal yn Ard near Maughold, King Orry's Grave at Laxey, Meayll Circle near Cregneash, and Ballaharra Stones at St John's. This was not the only Neolithic culture: there were also the local Ronaldsway and Bann cultures.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man", "title": "Top 10 Largest Cities or Towns of Isle of Man", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T12:08:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rYL3yolAIY", "description": "Go to http://www.facebook.com/intermountainmoms for more information.

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation. The herbal ingredients that may be used include virgin coconut oil, blueberry leaves, mashed papaya seeds, licorice, dandelion leaves, turmeric powder, bitter neem leaves, chamomile, camphor, aloe vera, spearmint leaves, witch hazel and nutmeg. \n\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\nEczema Home Remedies\nMost Common Symptoms of Eczema\nNatural Ways To Heal Eczema\nHow To Cure Your Eczema\neczema home treatment\neczema skin\nitchy skin\neczema treatment\ntreating eczema\neczema home\nNatural Cures for Eczema\nEczema Home Remedies\nTips For Curing Eczema\nEczema Natural Remedies", "title": "Seborrheic Dermatitis - How To Cure Your Eczema So It Never Reoccurs", "publishedDate": "2014-02-10T11:57:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rbImDwEP5U", "description": "Planta liberando O\u00b2 no aqu\u00e1rio durante a fotoss\u00edntese.", "title": "Pearling de Microsorium pteropus (samambaia / feto de java)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T00:55:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rc6orixsg8", "description": "Beautiful American chick speaking arabic in beautiful Egypt.\n\nIf this was you.. dam, hit me up hahaha :D", "title": "Beautiful American speaking arabic", "publishedDate": "2011-02-21T09:25:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8rcSnQSbBhk", "description": "AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Twin girls born with a rare condition in Ohio were breathing on their own and their mom said she and her husband were able to hold them on Mother's Day.\n \nSarah Thistlethwaite said babies Jillian and Jenna were removed from ventilators Sunday afternoon after they were able to breathe comfortably. She told The Associated Press that she and her husband Bill both held them for a while on Mother's Day.\n \n\"It's just hard to put into words how amazing it feels to know the girls are OK,\" she said. \"It's great to know that they're doing so well, and being able to hold them.\"\n \nThe identical twin girls shared the same amniotic sac and placenta. Such births are called monoamniotic, or \"mono mono,\" and doctors say they occur in about one of every 10,000 pregnancies.\n \nThey were born Friday at Akron General Medical Center, grasping each other's hands when doctors lifted them up for their parents to see after delivery.\n \nThistlethwaite told the Akron Beacon Journal (http://bit.ly/1hG517d ) that was \"the best Mother's Day present ever.\"\n \n\"They're already best friends,\" said Thistlethwaite, 32. \"I can't believe they were holding hands. That's amazing.\"\n \nJenna was born first at 4 pounds, 2 ounces and 17 inches, with Jillian following 48 seconds later at 3 pounds, 13 ounces and 17.5 inches.\n \nThey were moved temporarily to Akron Children's Hospital because they needed breathing assistance. Thistlethwaite expects to be released from Akron General on Tuesday, while the girls will remain in the hospital two to four weeks.\n \nDr. Melissa Mancuso helped deliver the twins, one of several amniotic pairs she has helped deliver in 11 years. She said the twins are at risk during pregnancy of entanglement of umbilical cords, which can cause death. Another woman at Akron General is expected to give birth later this week to monoamniotic twins.\n \nSarah and Bill Thistlethwaite, of Orrville, Ohio, have a son, Jaxon, whose first birthday was Jan. 27. That's the day they also found out she was carrying twins.\n \n\"All I could do was laugh,\" said Bill, 35.\n \nThey rushed to prepare their home for the twins, and Sarah was soon on bed rest.\n \nA middle school math teacher, she went into the hospital on March 14.\n \n\"It's hard, it really is,\" she said of extended bed rest. \"It was very mentally challenging knowing I have to sit here all day.\"\n \nBesides television, books and \"trashy gossip magazines,\" she viewed YouTube to learn how to crochet baby hats.\n \nThe girls were born at 33 weeks and two days. Mancuso said there were only minor issues during the pregnancy.\n \nSometimes the girls would kick the monitors off.\n \n\"I don't know what they're doing to each other,\" Sarah said jokingly of her \"sweet girls.\"\n \n--\n \nOnline:\n \nAkron Children's Hospital: bit.ly/1jwEkq8\n \n(c) 2014 The Associated Press.

To be able to do this is a great privilege and we're delighted to be here.\"\n\nResearch shows that robotic prostate surgery promotes shorter hospital stays and fewer infections, eliminates the danger of hemorrhaging, and reduces the risk of post operative sexual dysfunction.\n\nThe acquisition of the $2.6 million da Vinci system was made possible by the generosity of Fred and Nader Ohebshalom, the Iranian American Jewish Federation of New York, the Wolfson Foundation, the Crown Foundation, Alan C. Mendelson, and the Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nMore information on Dr. Samadi's SMART surgery technique can be found at:\nhttp://www.smart-surgery.com\n\nTo view more health-related videos by Dr. Samadi on YouTube please follow this link: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/RoboticOncology \n\nYou can also visit Dr. Samadi's website at:\nhttp://www.roboticoncology.com/\n\nTo sign up for Dr. Samadi's monthly newsletter please follow this link:\nhttp://www.roboticoncology.com/subscribe", "title": "Rambam's First Robotic Prostatectomy Performed By Dr. David B.

She had a long, curly, golden blond mane that she was always forced to put into a different style everyday of the week, a curly (like Rarity's) blond tail, and honey like eyes\nWhen she was a young filly, she would always get love letters which always stated something about how cute she was and how sweet her smiles were. But she didn't want to be seen as sweet or cute, she wanted to be more than that, so she decided to change her image.\nShe drew some sketches of her idea of her new image, and when she was finally satisfied, she went into town. She got her mane cut, bought some purple fabric (her favorite color), and got to working on her new look.\nShe went to school the next day with a long, straightened chocolate brown tail tied at the end with a purple hair tie and mane that covered one eye, a purple nightcap-like hat with a golden stripe, and a skull on the hair tie, stripe, and at the end of her hat. She wore a smirk on her face as if in triumph of how she looked. People thought she was the new pony in town, but then she'd look at them with her honey colored eyes and they knew it was her.\nShe got notes passed to her almost every second about how cool she was, how stylish she was, and how they wanted to be best friends with her. This made her so happy inside. Even the most popular colt in school would ask to hang out with her. One time, he told her how hypnotizing her smirks were and how her stares would captivate anyone, which made her stand out from everypony else. This made her notice that this was what she really wanted, to be admired for being different than anypony else. Then, it happened, she go her cutiemark!\nShe decided she didn't want to live with her aunt any longer, even at her young age. She lived in the Everfree Forest after that, she saw it as another way to be different than the others. She now visits Canterlot just to strut down the street and show her stuff. The high society ponies always just stare, but it makes her not just part of the in crowd, it makes her an individual.\n------\nTo see the full picture, click the link right here! http://redcorvette68.deviantart.com/#/d4vr24e\n-----\nSorry there's no music again, I made this on my dad's computer and it doesn't have any music...", "title": "Say hello to Skull", "publishedDate": "2012-05-02T22:13:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s7Np7D4oC4", "description": "Webisode: Snapshot", "title": "Polly Pocket\u2122 - Snapshot", "publishedDate": "2011-09-20T21:11:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s8ZhWQMHnE", "description": "Q & A with BC Family Lawyer Lorne MacLean, QC\nhttp://macleanfamilylaw.ca \n\nQuestion: I Think My Spouse is Alienating My Children from Me, What can I Do?\n\nAnswer: Some experts say parental, or child, alienation happens routinely in high conflict divorces, while others experts say it's rare. More commonly, a child rejects a parent when a number of factors involving both parents' behaviours exist.\n\nAn alienated child expresses persistent unreasonably negative feelings and beliefs, even fear and hatred, towards a parent that they had a previously healthy relationship with.\n\nConversely, an estranged child's refusal to see a parent may be reasonable because that parent has parenting capacity issues such as anger management, substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nDon't delay, immediate legal intervention to counsel the family and, in severe cases, to even reverse custody is key. Remember, an alienated child does not just have an unhealthy relationship with the rejected parent they have an equally unhealthy relationship with the custodial parent.\n\nTo request a consultation, visit http://macleanfamilylaw.ca or call MacLean Law at 1.877.602.9900", "title": "I Think My Spouse is Alienating My Children from Me, What can I Do?", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T17:15:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s8i77IpRmc", "description": "After finding out his best friend has cancer, first grader, Vincent Butterfield, shaved his head and raised money to help support the expensive treatments.", "title": "First Grader Shaves Head For Friend With Cancer", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T17:11:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s8uaT6MxHw", "description": "made by: https://www.facebook.com/EvLSkillz \nfor Motzu/Provenzano/Tez Garai/Ricko/Melinte/ERS\u00fa and the rest of the crazy guys with BMW e36 who attended the meeting. \nThis meeting took place near Brasov, Romania.", "title": "Trailer E36 Meeting 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-28T15:09:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s8zauhYKnw", "description": "Lissut: Pissikset", "title": "Pissis dance", "publishedDate": "2007-06-10T09:31:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s9-RzYi134", "description": "Wearing a taffeta gown the lady strolls in the formal garden", "title": "Bygone days", "publishedDate": "2007-03-04T04:21:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s9CKfd1JCE", "description": "Betty is so sleepy she can't stay awake!

He hosted the BBC television show Jim'll Fix It, was the first and last presenter of the long-running BBC music chart show Top of the Pops, and raised an estimated \u00a340 million for charities. A year after his death, hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape became public, leading the police to believe that Savile was a predatory sex offender, and may have been one of Britain's most prolific sexual offenders.\n\nHe presented the first edition of Top of the Pops in 1964 and broadcast on BBC Radio 1 from 1968. Between 1975 and 1994 he presented Jim'll Fix It, a popular television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, to come true. During his lifetime, he was noted for fundraising and supporting charities and hospitals, in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire. He was described in The Guardian as a \"prodigious philanthropist\" and was honoured for his charity work. He was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990.\n\nIn October 2012, almost a year after his death, an ITV documentary examining claims of sexual abuse against Savile led to broad media coverage and a substantial and rapidly growing body of witness statements and sexual abuse claims, including accusations against public bodies for covering up or failure of duty. Scotland Yard launched a criminal investigation into allegations of child sex abuse by Savile over six decades, describing him as a \"predatory sex offender\", and later stated that they were pursuing over 400 lines of inquiry based on the testimony of 300 potential victims via fourteen police forces across the UK. By late October 2012, the scandal had resulted in inquiries or reviews at the BBC, within the National Health Service, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the Department of Health.\n\n*** Content above sourced from Wikipedia\n\n---------------------\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR UPDATES! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=deejayone1", "title": "Jimmy Savile 'Jingle Jangle Jewellery'- Do the 'Jimmy Jangle'!", "publishedDate": "2012-06-12T19:05:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s_UqYTkLzM", "description": "this is our second mastered recording. we hope you enjoy our more technical side :)\n*LYRICS*\nI, I see the light\nIt trails right through my eyes\nCome with me\nI'll show you this sight\nYou'll feel serene\nFinally, feel with all your might\nI feel this purity\nI now control my own sense of conscientiousness\nFast, I'm ascending toward this truth of happiness\nI have no longer a robotic guise\nWhere is your mind?\nSo lost and senseless\nBreakthrough this time\nUnfold your fucking eyes\nAnd, precept this light\nFeel this strength\nDon't be weak\nDon't falter to the masses sway\nDon't go that way\nI, I see the light\nIt trails right through my eyes\nI see the light\nI feel serene\nCatch this light and feel pure again\n\nall credits go to our buddy, Nick Maston whom recorded, mixed, and mastered this piece", "title": "Retaliate - Serene", "publishedDate": "2014-01-05T02:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s_uyw2h3V4", "description": "This short film will tell you about a little night trip to the country of insects on the cape Fiolent in Ukraine, Crimea , Sevastopol.\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043e \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u044b\u0441\u0443 \u0424\u0438\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0432 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c, \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c.\nCrimea Geographic : Simonenko Semen | Gennady Razbegaev\n28/04/2013", "title": "Fiolent alive at night [Crimea Geographic]", "publishedDate": "2013-04-30T19:09:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8s_xzl0ocqw", "description": "Soon, Elusion\u00ae will change the world and life as we know it.\n \nA new technology called Elusion is sweeping the country.

Debunked! Chelyabinsk meteor. Was it UFO or Russian military rocket cause for Chelyabinsk meteor explosion? Was it shot down by UFO or rocket ? Watch it to find out! This video was created with detail analysis of Chelyabinsk meteor atmosphere entry. It's amazing how many videos posted that Chelyabinsk meteor was shot by UFO or military rocket! Unbelievable!  People forgot that driver was taking movie through his car's windshield glass!!! Light paths from windshield glass were all over around Chelyabinsk meteor fireball. Dynamics of the moving car and the Chelyabinsk meteor fireball created lots of visual effects that had nothing related to meteor itself. By the way, watching other movies of the falling Chelyabinsk meteor meteor through the atmosphere shows that no UFOs or rocket were hitting it.\nThe Chelyabinsk meteorite is the fragmented remains of the large Chelyabinsk meteor of 15 February 2013 which reached the ground after the meteor's passage through the atmosphere. The descent of the meteor, visible as a brilliant superbolide in the morning sky, caused a series of shock waves that shattered windows, damaged approximately 7,200 buildings and left 1,500 people injured.The resulting fragments were scattered over a wide area.\nhe meteor and meteorite are named after Chelyabinsk Oblast, over which the meteor exploded. An initial proposal was to name the meteorite after Lake Chebarkul, where one of its major fragments allegedly impacted and made a 6-meters-wide hole in the frozen lake surface. The large meteorite has yet to be found, but smaller fragments were retrieved from the ice around the hole.\nThe meteorite has been preliminary classified as an ordinary chondrite. First estimates of its composition indicate about 10% of meteoric iron, as well as olivine and sulfides \nhe impacting asteroid started to brighten up in the general direction of the Pegasus constellation, close to the East horizon where the Sun was starting to rise. The impactor belonged to the Apollo group of near-Earth asteroids. The asteroid had an approximate size of 18 meters (59 ft) and a mass of about 9,100 tonnes (10,000 short tons) before it entered the denser parts of Earth's atmosphere and started to ablate. At an altitude of about 23.3 km (14.5 miles) the body exploded in an air burst. Meteorite fragments of the body landed on the ground.", "title": "Was Chelyabinsk meteor shot by UFO or rocket?

The rich red colour comes from fresh beetroot (which was originally the idea anyway!), coupled with fresh cranberries - which you may substitute with raspberries or strawberries if you prefer. The result is a beautifully moist (thanks to the beetroot) and pretty red velvet cake that everyone knows and loves - not to mention, additives-free and more healthy!\n\nThis recipe uses 1/2 cup of fresh beetroot - if you would like less of a beetroot taste in your cupcakes, you can reduce it down to 1/4 cup of beetroot, with more raspberries/strawberries to intensify the red colour instead. Another tip is to add some vanilla to mask the beetroot flavour.\n\nMakes about 12-16 cupcakes.\n\nCREDITS\nThe music used in this video was arranged and \nproduced by Tom Cusack.

A cute village girl sweeps outside her hut in Rajasthan, holding her sibling in her hands. She then heads out to the village well, water bowl in hand.\n\nLife in Jaisalmer is quiet and simple as we see in this clip. Children helping their mother doing the household works, and we can see water scarcity prevailing in the state of Rajasthan as children carrying utensils for fetching water.\n\nJaisalmer nicknamed \"The Golden city\", is a town in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is located 575 kilometres (357 mi) west of the state capital Jaipur. It was once known as Jaisalmer state. The town stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone, crowned by a fort, which contains the palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples are finely sculptured. It lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (great Indian desert) and has a population of about 78,000. It is the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District.\nJaisalmer is named after Maharawal Jaisal Singh, a Rajput king who founded the city in 1156 AD. \"Jaisalmer\" means \"the Hill Fort of Jaisal\". Jaisalmer is sometimes called the \"Golden City of India\" because the yellow sand and the yellow sandstone used in every architecture of the city gives a yellowish-golden tinge to the city and its surrounding area.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

More commonly called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A quickly progressive malignant disease in which there are too many immature blood-forming cells in the blood and bone marrow, the cells being specifically those destined to give rise to the granulocytes or monocytes, both types of white blood cells that fight infections. In AML, these blasts do not mature and so become too numerous. AML can occur in adults or children. \n\nThe early signs of AML may be similar to the flu or other common diseases with fever, weakness and fatigue, loss of weight and appetite, and aches and pains in the bones or joints. Other signs of AML may include tiny red spots in the skin, easy bruising and bleeding, frequent minor infections, and poor healing of minor cuts.\n\nFirst, blood tests are done to count the number of each of the different kinds of blood cells and see whether they are within normal ranges. In AML, the red blood cell levels may be low, causing anemia; platelet levels may be low, causing bleeding and bruising; and the white blood cell levels may be low, leading to infections. \n\nA bone marrow biopsy or a bone marrow aspiration may be done if the results of the blood tests are abnormal. During a bone marrow biopsy, a hollow needle is inserted into the hip bone to remove a small amount of the marrow and bone for examination under a microscope. In a bone marrow aspirate, a small sample of liquid bone marrow is withdrawn through a syringe.\n\nA lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may be done to see if the disease has spread into the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the central nervous system (CNS) -- the brain and spinal cord.\n\nOther key diagnostic tests may include flow cytometry (in which cells are passed through a laser beam for analysis), immunohistochemistry (using antibodies to distinguish between types of cancer cells), cytogenetics (to determine chromosome changes in cells), and molecular genetic studies (DNA and RNA tests of the cancer cells). \n\nThe primary treatment of AML is chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is less common; it may be used in certain cases. Bone marrow transplantation is under study in clinical trials and is coming into increasing use. \n\nThere are two phases of treatment for AML. The first phase is called induction therapy. The purpose of induction therapy is to kill as many of the leukemia cells as possible and induce a remission, a state in which there is no visible evidence of disease and blood counts are normal. Patients may receive a combination of drugs during this phase including daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone plus cytarabine and thioguanine. Once in remission with no signs of leukemia, patients enter a second phase of treatment. \n\nThe second phase of treatment is called post-remission therapy (or continuation therapy). It is designed to kill any remaining leukemic cells. In post-remission therapy, patients may receive high doses of chemotherapy, designed to eliminate any remaining leukemic cells. Treatment may include a combination of cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, or cytarabine.\n\nThere are a number of different subtypes of AML. AML is classified using a system called the French American British (FAB) system. In the this system, the subtypes of AML are grouped according to the particular cell line in which the disease developed. There are eight distinct types of AML, designated M0 through M7. Types M2 (myeloblastic leukemia with maturation) and M4 (myelomonocytic leukemia) each account for 25% of AML; M1 (myeloblastic leukemia, with few or no mature cells) accounts for 15%; M3 (promyelocytic leukemia) and M5 (monocytic leukemia) each account for 10% of cases; the other subtypes are rarely seen. AML is also classified according to the chromosomal abnormalities in the malignant cells. \n\n\n\n\n\nmedical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "Definition Of Acute myelogenous leukemia (Medical Dictionary Online)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T16:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8suBe87g2Uc", "description": "http://www.cjponyparts.com/door-sill-plate-cp-fb-1964-1968/p/DSP1/\n\nWhen replacing your carpet, you should install new door sill plates to bring your interior some new shine.

Wimpertierchen sind ein Stamm der Alveolata, zu dem etwa 7500 Arten gez\u00e4hlt werden. Sie gelten als die am h\u00f6chsten entwickelten und am st\u00e4rksten differenzierten Protisten. Ihre besondere Organisation wird aber auch als Fortentwicklung eines Synzytiums diskutiert.\n\nCiliata kommen in den Meeren und im S\u00fc\u00dfwasser sowie terrestrisch in feuchter Erde vor. Es gibt freischwimmende und festsitzende Formen. Einige k\u00f6nnen kommensalisch leben, wie die Enodinia im Pansen von Wiederk\u00e4uern. Diese k\u00f6nnen mit Hilfe von Cellulasen die Cellulose aus der aufgenommenen Nahrung zersetzen. Manche leben auch symbiotisch mit in der Innenschicht eingelagerten Gr\u00fcnalgen (Zoochlorellen). Wieder andere leben rein parasit\u00e4r, wie der Ichthyophthirius multifilis, ein Hauptparasit der Aquarienfische.\n\nDie meisten Arten sind weltweit verbreitet, es werden aber auch immer mehr Endemiten entdeckt. Einige Arten sind nur aus den eng begrenzten Bioz\u00f6nosen der Phytotelmata, z. B. der Wassertrichter der Bromelien oder aus dem Zootelma im Kiemenraum von Landasseln bekannt.\n\nDas Nahrungsspektrum der Wimpertierchen ist breit. Viele Arten ern\u00e4hren sich von Bakterien, andere von Flagellaten, Amoeben, Algen oder Pilzen und etliche leben r\u00e4uberisch und fressen andere Wimpertierchen. Die Ern\u00e4hrung verl\u00e4uft \u00fcber ein Cytostom, eine mund\u00e4hnliche \u00d6ffnung in der Zellmembran. Dem Cytostom vorgelagert ist eine charakteristische Vertiefung in der Zelloberfl\u00e4che, die Buccalh\u00f6hle. Durch das Cytostom gelangt das Nahrungspartikel, in einer sogenannten Nahrungsvakuole verpackt, in das Zellinnere. Dort kreist die Vakuole auf einem festgelegtem Weg einmal durch den gesamten Zellk\u00f6rper, w\u00e4hrend sie durch Acidosome anges\u00e4uert und durch Lysosomen mit Hydrolasen versorgt wird. In ihrem Inneren wird die Nahrung zersetzt. Die lebensnotwendigen Stoffe werden in das Cytoplasma aufgenommen und die Reststoffe an einer Art Zellafter, der Cytopyge, ausgeschieden. Der zyklische Vorgang wird auch Cyclose genannt.\n\nDieser Artikel basiert auf dem Artikel Wimpertierchen aus der freien Enzyklop\u00e4die Wikipedia und steht unter der Doppellizenz GNU-Lizenz f\u00fcr freie Dokumentation und Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported (Kurzfassung).

Cilia occur in all members of the group (although the peculiar Suctoria only have them for part of the life-cycle) and are variously used in swimming, crawling, attachment, feeding, and sensation.\n\nCiliates are one of the most important groups of protists, common almost everywhere there is water \u2014 in lakes, ponds, oceans, rivers, and soils. Ciliates have many ectosymbiotic and endosymbiotic members, as well as some obligate and opportunistic parasites. Ciliates are large single cells, a few reaching 2 mm in length, and are some of the most complex protozoans in structure.\n\nThe term \"Ciliophora\" is used in classification as a order.[1] Ciliophora can be classified under Protista[2] or Protozoa.[3] The term \"Ciliata\" is also used,[4] as a class.[5] (However, this latter term can also refer to a type of fish.) Protista classification is rapidly evolving, and it is not rare to encounter these terms used to describe other hierarchical levels.", "title": "Wimpertierchen - Ciliophora - Ciliata - Ciliate - Leben im Wassertropfen - life in a drop of water", "publishedDate": "2014-03-09T13:04:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8t1QmGkG9Gk", "description": "Everyone's talking about Oscar.

So, in workout A, you are going to do a series of 30 second exercises with no rest in between for a period of 20 minutes in total.\n\nTo start, you'll do Kettlebell One Arm Swings.  Bring the KB back between your legs and drive through your hips to bring the KB up to shoulder height.  After 30 seconds switch over to the other arm and repeat for an additional 30 seconds.  \n\nImmediately following the swings, go to the ground and do either regular Push ups, Close-Grip push-ups or any other variation you choose, but you have to do it for 30 seconds.\n\nOnce you've gone for 30 seconds you'll move into Bodyweight Squats.  With your back flat and chest up, move your hips back and squat down.  Again this exercise is for 30 seconds.\n\nAfter the squats, you're back down to the ground for 30 seconds of Mountain Climbers. Note, this is 30 seconds total, and not per side. So, in a regular push up position, bring you knee up to your chest and then back out, alternating sides.  \n\nThe next exercise is Front Loaded Lunges.  This can either be done using a dumbbell or a kettlebell. So, place the DB/KB in front of you and lunge forward.  Be sure to drop your hips down, and drive up on your front heel, while alternating sides.\n\nAlternatively, you can do bodyweight lunges or the Lunge Jump.\n\nOnce you've finished your lunges, without rest, start right from the top again and keep on going for 20 minutes.  \n\nVisit Turbulence Training to get your FREE sample fat burning workout.

While Dave is an overworked lawyer, husband and father of three, Mitch has remained a single, quasi-employed man-child who has never met a responsibility he liked. Following a drunken night out together, Mitch and Dave's worlds are turned upside down when they wake up in each other's bodies and proceed to freak the &*#@ out.

It takes advantage of four design elements:\n(1) an inhomogeneous magnetic field that repels a diamagnetic plate so that it floats about 1 mm above the track,\n(2) the shape and size of the diamagnetic plate is optimized in a way so that, with the specific permanent magnet in use, the train is guided even at bends along the track without touching the surface,\n(3) a linear motor using a sensor coil and two drive coils to move the train model forward,\n(4) solar panels which convert solar energy into electrical energy.\n\nThe track consists of three rows of neodymium platelets which are aligned in a way so that the two outer rows are inversely polarized to the middle row on which the train model moves. As a diamagnetic material a thin layer of pyrolytic graphite is used. Pyrolytic graphite is a material which is neither ferromagnetic nor paramagnetic so that the repulsive properties of diamagnetism become effective. The linear motor senses the slight disturbances in the magnetic field between the neodymium platelets of the track thanks to the sensor coil. It switches between the two drive coils to that the model train can move along. The little electricity which is needed for the linear motor to operate comes from the solar panels on top of the model train.", "title": "Magnetic Levitation Train", "publishedDate": "2006-06-08T15:57:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tFyZdXswqk", "description": "Happy St. Patrick's Day!

Space inside an atom is not empty, but filled with space-matter (or ether).\nMain points discussed: \nThe space inside an atom is filled with space-matter.\nIndividual atoms are transparent for light and particles.\nWhen the photons (or particles) pass the through atoms, their speed is reduced and gets refracted.\nSince each photon\u2019s (or particle\u2019s) trajectory is not the same, each of them hits different points on the atoms and refract at different angles. \nPhotons (or particles) which hit on the same point on the atoms refract at same angle.\nThis creates the diffraction pattern.\nShooting one photon (or particle) at a time for a period of time, can still create the diffraction pattern.\nThe diffraction of light (or particles) is the result of REFRACTION. \nTherefore there are more studies still needed to probe the real nature of light and matter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/atommodel\nhttps://www.physics-edu.org\n\nBackground music: Title: Microchip (Source: YouTube Audio Library)\nSound effects: Swoosh (Source: YouTube Audio Library)", "title": "Diffraction of Light (or particles) is the Result of REFRACTION by Atoms!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-27T16:50:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tHQjQahIkA", "description": "Ja\u0161kovec 2010", "title": "Polyporus umbellatus", "publishedDate": "2010-12-14T07:00:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tHXKfrizuw", "description": "The Board of County Commissioners for Benton County, WA turned to Cerium Networks to bring in the right team from Cisco to design, manage, implement and execute a plan that would make their collaboration dreams come true. \n\nLearn more about Cisco Master Security Specialization: http://cs.co/6056SvXm", "title": "Master Security Specialization \u2013 Cerium Networks", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T18:51:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tI1_KlO6xI", "description": "Music video by Culture Club performing Time (Clock Of The Heart) (2004 Digital Remaster).", "title": "Culture Club - Time (Clock Of The Heart)", "publishedDate": "2009-06-02T23:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tIfj9k9qQg", "description": "http://www.dressler.ic.cz/", "title": "DERRINGER REX", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T21:56:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tJ3X5XBqwI", "description": "Diskutiere mit uns auf http://www.torgranate.de/ \u00fcber dieses und andere Fu\u00dfball-Events!", "title": "C-Liga Fulda: Fuldaer Kickers - Bimbach II", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T20:59:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tJ9eSQdJP4", "description": "Billy Joel's Rootbeer Rag.

But, She has been  inspired by the FAMOUS FRENCH IMPRESSIONIST ARTISTS. How can you possibly be a FRENCH PAINTER and not be influenced by the FRENCH IMPRESSIONISTS?\n\nAfter all, FRENCH IMPRESSIONISM is one of the most important developments in the history of modern Art.\n\nAt the top of the LIST OF FRENCH IMPRESSIONIST PAINTERS is undoubtedly CLAUDE MONET. It was his painting \"Impression Sunrise\" depicting the port of le Havre, that, via an unfriendly art critic, gave the movement it's name.\n\nSee MONET'S ART in this video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiaLKrT_p6I\n\nRaised in Normandy, Monet was introduced to plein-air painting by Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, known for paintings of the resorts that dotted the region's Channel coast, and subsequently studied informally with the Dutch landscapist Johan Jongkind (1819--1891). When he was twenty-two, Monet joined the Paris studio of the academic history painter Charles Gleyre. His classmates included Auguste Renoir, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, and other future Impressionists.\n\nMonet enjoyed limited success in these early years, with a handful of landscapes, seascapes, and portraits accepted for exhibition at the annual Salons of the 1860s. Yet many of the rejection of his more ambitious works, notably the large-scale Women in the Garden (1866; Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris), inspired Monet to join with Edgar Degas, \u00c9douard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Renoir, and others in establishing an independent exhibition in 1874. Impression: Sunrise (1873; Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Paris), one of Monet's contributions to this exhibition, drew particular scorn for the unfinished appearance of its loose handling and indistinct forms. Yet the artists saw the criticism as a badge of honor, and subsequently called themselves \"Impressionists\" after the painting's title, even though the name was first used derisively.\n\nmore here: http://francoisecariou.com\n\nMonet found subjects in his immediate surroundings, as he painted the people and places he knew best. His first wife, Camille, and his second wife, Alice, frequently served as models. His landscapes chart journeys around the north of France and to London, where he escaped the Franco-Prussian War of 1870--71.\n\nReturning to France, Monet moved first to Argenteuil, just fifteen minutes from Paris by train, then west to V\u00e9theuil, Poissy, and finally to the more rural Giverny in 1883. His homes and gardens became gathering places for friends, including Manet and Renoir, who often painted alongside their host.

Amongst many other black projects, a team of British scientists working at an Infinitum Research experimental station stumbled across some remarkable phenomena involving DNA manipulation. This led to deeper research with dangerously unpredictable results, often leading to human patients losing their lives in irresponsible and immoral experiments.\n\nTime passed on, and by the mid 1990s the failure rate of the experiments had been reduced from 75% to a mere 15%, enough for Infinitum to move onto the next stage: Biological Light Refraction. The British team were hoping to unravel the possibilities of light manipulation to create the perfect covert military agent. Early into the new millennium, due to a gross miscalculation, a series of tests on Subject 617 led to a massive synaptic trauma leaving the patient with multiple genetic anomalies.\n\nThe subject was left in constant pain and with unstable DNA. The subject escaped captivity, killing anyone that got in its way. The I.R.I.S. (Infinitum Research Interception Squad) team have been deployed to return the subject to a maximum security Infinitum Research facility for further study and dissection. The entire project was considered a failure: all funding ceased and development was discontinued while all records and traces of the experiments were destroyed. Infinitum Research denies all knowledge of any form of human DNA manipulation but are more than happy to comment on the possibilities of cloning human organs inside suitable animal donors. It is believed that these organ cloning experiments form the main cover for their human genetic manipulation experimentations.\n\nSubject 617, known as 'The Hidden', must turn the tables and become the hunter instead of the hunted as the I.R.I.S. team close their net around him.\"\n\nRenee: http://www.youtube.com/user/lolrenaynay\nMax: http://www.youtube.com/user/gassymexican\nNick: http://www.youtube.com/user/eatmydiction1\nMarc: http://www.youtube.com/user/juicetra\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "HUNTED BY THE JOKER (The Hidden)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T16:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8tluWa7avmQ", "description": "B\u00e9nichon de la Gruy\u00e8re.
