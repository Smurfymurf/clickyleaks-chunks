The name has a Dutch origin, but by misidentification. Dutch meerkat refers to the \"guenon\", a monkey of the Cercopithecus genus. The word \"meerkat\" is Dutch for \"lake cat\", but the suricata is not in the cat family, and neither suricatas nor guenons are attracted to lakes; the word possibly started as a Dutch adaptation of a derivative of Sanskrit marka\u0163a \u092e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u091f = \"monkey\", perhaps in Africa via an Indian sailor on board a Dutch East India Company ship. The traders of the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with monkeys, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. The suricata is called stokstaartje = \"little stick-tail\" in Dutch.\nAccording to African popular belief (mainly in the Zambian/Zimbabwean region), the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone tribesmen. : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat", "title": "Hreggvi\u00f0ur Loki \u00ed Chessington - Amusement park -   Meercats  Markettir", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T08:11:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4K8cEes7Zpg", "description": "Went through my old Reach theatre today, this one definitely stood out to me.

What do you think will happen to Olaf when he spends time on a warm beach that is surrounded by the ocean?\n\nOur daughter is a big fan of the Disney movie Frozen. She loves Queen Elsa and loves to sing the Elsa song \"let it Go\".

Also dress your model in old clothes and give them a blanket of some kind if you're outside so they can stay as warm as possible. Though we live in Canada so your mileage may vary.\n\nStep 2: Tape down your plastic wrap over the subject's hair. This keeps the plaster strips from becoming fused into their hair and them hating you forever. Tape it down as tightly as possible for the best effect. Don't worry about the ears they can be either exposed or covered. We left them uncovered but either way lifting a cast from them is very difficult. [Remember: you have to get this cast off of their face after it dries]\n\nStep 3: Vaseline needs to be applied to any exposed skin which you will be casting. This makes removal much easier later without hurting your model or damaging the cast. We also applied Vaseline to the plastic wrap but it's not necessary.\n\nStep 4: Cut up a large amount of strips before you begin so you don't need to worry about getting more later. I recommend at least 50 of varying widths. Having serrated edges can help the strips stick together a little better as the fiber strands tangle together a bit better than smooth edges.\n\nStep 5: This is the longest step so make sure your model is completely comfortable because this process can range from 30 min to over 2 hours depending on how fast you are or how many layers you do. Simply dip the plaster strip into water and begin layering them onto your subject's face from the outside inwards. Building around the natural shapes on the face can help you add strength to the places you want the most detail from. Try to keep the subject's eyes mouth and nose exposed for as long as possible to reduce discomfort. Once you have the inner face blocked in continue overlaying strips over each other until they cover half the subject's head. [Important because we are only molding the front half of the head so we can actually remove it.] Continue downwards and cover up the front half of the neck. [Ideally your subject would have no beard as this is not cast anyway, but in our case it still worked but it is a bit harder to have the strips stick on properly.] Now this is the point when you could just stop if you only want a cast of the face but we continued to plaster down past the point we want the cowl to end at so that we could capture details from the shoulder and chest.\n\nStep 6: After you have completed your first layer you will want to go over it again a few times [How many times depends on personal preference because this increases the material costs but also increases the strength of the cast.] The last thing your should cover are the eyes and place a small thin strip along the underside of the nose leaving the nostrils exposed...You know, so they can actually breath. Be very careful with the eyes, be sure to let your model know when and what you are doing and that they have their eyes shut. Gently place a strip across the eyes and gently press down to capture the eye lid details. Put the same amount of layers over the eyes as on the rest of the cast. \n\nStep 7: Touch up the masks with strips in weak spots. I put emphasis into the facial detail sections and the forehead to give them extra strength.\n\nStep 8: Wait until the mask dries completely. About 20-40 minutes depending on conditions.\n\nStep 9: Gently but firmly peel off the cast. Try not to crack it but you can patch up any damage with more strips.\n\n[Song: Batman - Mask of the Phantasm]", "title": "Creating a Batman Cowl - Part I", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T04:25:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Ka7uMxRE14", "description": "Je luistert naar een aantal fraaie fragmenten uit de 'Essays' van Michel de Montaigne.

Ataklan hails from the village of Chinapoo in the heart of Laventille- the urban community that was once the epicentre of Trinidad's Golden Age culture- and now is collapsing into zones of urban decay and gangland criminality.

Not only are activists, the common people and scientists calling for it, so are investors and technology companies.  New solar power technology is coming into our lives all of the time in bits and pieces, which all add up to help put us on the path to renewable energy sources.  \n\nA Brief Look At The Past\n\nThe human race grows, matures and changes priorities.  When the priorities change, that's where the money, resources and idea makers go.  Perhaps first these were fire makers.  Then they were boat-builders and sailors, farmers and herders.  In the Industrial Revolution, the priorities went to bringing mass manufacturing to the masses.  In the last twenty years, the home computer industry has been the primary focus of the world's financial and scientific attention.  In fact, with the help of computers, we might never have known about global warming until it was way too late.\n\nPC Parallels\n\nThere are many things about the solar power industry that are paralleling the personal computer industry.  The first computers filled entire office buildings and did little more than crunch numbers.  But now you can get a tiny cell phone with a screen just a tad bigger than a gnat's behind which can pretty much run every aspect of your entire life.  What made computers smaller yet more powerful?  Silicon chips.\n\nThe new solar power technology is also using silicon for solar power panels.  The cells in the panels are usually crystalline silicon cells.  They are gradually getting smaller and rapidly becoming cheaper.  There are also new ways to store these solar power panels.  Tiny rows of solar power cells can run a retail store's calculator for an entire work day.  Solar power cells can be laid onto a rollable mat and rolled out only when you need it, then rolled up and stored away for when you don't.\n\nBoth of these devices are not science fiction.  They are commonly in use today.  New solar power technology is being integrated into our lives and homes to keep us from total future shock.  With each use of the new solar power technology, we are that much closer to keeping this planet from going belly up.  As more and more consumers demand renewable energy, there should be dizzying advances in the new solar power technology as there has been for personal computers.", "title": "New Solar Power Technology | The Race Is On For New Solar Power Technology", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T11:01:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4KoFFu9uAO0", "description": "Emily from SmartPak talks about how to fit the Micklem Competition Bridle (http://bit.ly/169P8BY) and why she thinks it is so smart.\n\nThe smartest reason to get yours at SmartPak?

If you're a basketball player and you want to be the best at your position, you want to be able to jump higher. You want to be able to start dunking. These four exercises should definitely be implemented in your workout routine. So without further ado let's get right into these exercises.\n\n0:28 Essential exercise #1 to increase your vertical jump is the squat. The squat is one of the best full body exercises that you can do to increase full body strength, and it's probably the best lower body exercise. And here's how to do a squat properly. First you want to start off with your feet shoulder width apart. You're going to rest the bar on your upper back, not your neck or your arms. And make sure your upper back is tight and squeezed. Your toes are pointed slightly outward. Keep your chest up. Breathe in when going down. Bend down by moving your hips back as if you're sitting in a chair then bend your knees. Knees do not go past your toes. Keep the bar above the middle of your foot. Bend down to at least parallel. Breathe out while you drive your heels into the ground. Go up leading with your chest and driving your hips forward with your legs and your glutes. Squeeze your glutes at the top. With the squat you'll do 3 sets of 5 reps with heavy weight.\n\n1:19 Essential exercise #2 to increase your vertical jump is the box jump. To properly do a box jump start off in an athletic position with your feet about shoulder width apart at a comfortable distance from the box. When you're ready to jump drop quickly into a quarter squat then extend your hips, swing your arms, and push your feet into the floor to propel yourself onto the box. Box jumps are a compound multi-joint exercise. When training for explosive power in basketball do box jumps at a challenging height for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\n1:49 Essential exercise #3 for increasing your vertical jump is calf raises. To properly do a calf raise you want to get in a squat position under a weighted bar. You'll be in the same starting position as the squat. Then raise your heels off the floor as high as you can while you exhale. Contract your calves and hold that contraction at the top for a second. Then inhale and go back to the starting position by slowly lowering your heels. Now for calf raises you're going to want to do 3 sets of 15 reps.\n\n2:15 Essential exercise #4 for increasing your vertical jump is dumbbell step ups. Here's how to properly do a dumbbell step up. Stand up straight while holding a pair of fairly heavy dumbbells. Step onto the raised platform with your right foot. Drive your heel into the platform. Keep your knee in line and keep a neutral spine. Then raise your opposing knee all the way up to parallel. Then step down and repeat the process with the other leg. With dumbbell step-ups do 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\nThose are 4 exercises that will definitely help you jump higher if you're a basketball player, but if you really want to increase your vertical jump you need an official jump training program. This is the absolute best and quickest way to being able to jump higher and increasing your vertical leap. You can be doing all the exercises and stretches and warm-ups that you can possibly think of, but if you're not doing them properly and in the most effective way they're not going to get you anywhere. A good jump training program will show you step-by-step exactly how to jump higher.\n\nClick the link at the top of this video description, and that will take you to the best jump training program that's available right now.

It describes war-torn men suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, otherwise known as shell shock. Owen based the poem on his experience of Craiglockhart Military Hospital, near Edinburgh, where he was invaldided in the summer of 1917, suffering from shell shock.\n\nIn the first Stanza it starts off with multiple questions. \u201cWho are these? Why sit they here in twilight?\u201d Wilfred starts off with a querying tone emphasizing on the words who, why and wherefore. This could show how men would think after the war, while having a mental breakdown and trying to figure out what happened. The second stanza goes on to describe the soldiers sensations and how their memories are filled with people they have witnessed killed or people they killed themselves. It gives some visuals such as \"Treading blood from lungs that had once loved laughter\" and \"Batter of guns, shatter of flying muscles\" which creates powerful mental images of chaos and suffering.The third stanza describes how those who survived the war live now with shell shock, relating bloody images (Bloodsmear, blood-black, wound that bleeds afresh) to the common stages of a day (sunrise, night, dawn).\n\nWilfred Edward Salter Owen MC (18 March 1893 \u2013 4 November 1918) was an English poet and soldier, one of the leading poets of the First World War. His shocking, realistic war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was heavily influenced by his friend and mentor Siegfried Sassoon, and stood in stark contrast both to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best-known works \u2013 most of which were published posthumously \u2013 are \"Dulce et Decorum est\", \"Insensibility\", \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", \"Futility\" and \"Strange Meeting\".\n\nKind Regards\n\nJim Clark\nAll rights are reserved on this video recording copyright Jim Clark 2014", "title": "Mental Cases - Wilfred Owen - Poem - Animation - WW1", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T11:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4L3Rs8I3B7M", "description": "http://naxshamuzika.blogspot.com", "title": "Uighur Folk Song - Uyghur  Xelq Naxshisi -Hoy Bala", "publishedDate": "2007-08-12T10:49:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4L4M7GxjBRw", "description": "Quick and easy fish adobo dish of mackerel (typically galunggong).

Matt Damon John Krasinski\nPeople can light their taps on fire because of gas drilling. This is one of those cases. In fact, one of the companies that produced Truthland, Chesapeake Energy, was responsible for this mess. A snippet from the Marcellus Shale Reality Tour video\nSherry Vargson gave the group a tour of her farm in Granville Township, where Chesapeake Energy has drilled one well and installed compressor and metering stations and a gathering pipeline. She said her water became contaminated with methane after maintenance activities at the site in June 2010, and lit water from her tap alight for a trip attendees and the media.\n\n\nThe little bus wound its way over green mountains, alongside undeveloped stretches of the meandering Susquehanna River and through some of Pennsylvania's most pristine wilderness.\n\n \nThe man inside with the microphone, the Gas Drilling Awareness Coalition's Scott Cannon, said there's trouble in paradise as he pointed out the changes Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling has brought to Pennsylvania's Northern Tier.\n\nHere was a drilling rig, there a water withdrawal site and every so often yet another pipeline was laid out in preparation for burial.\n\nThe sights were part of the coalition's \"Marcellus Shale Reality Tour,\" held Sunday for area legislators, municipal representatives and candidates for political office.\n\n\"We still have to deal with pipelines, compressor stations; they wanted to put a frack water treatment facility in Hanover Township -- that was an hour away from the nearest drill site,\" Cannon said.\n\nAbout 15 people attended the tour, including candidate for U.S. representative Bill Vinsko, Wilkes-Barre Administrative Coordinator Drew McLaughlin and Luzerne County Council candidates Kathleen Dobash, Salvatore Licata, Eileen Sorokas and Michelle Bednar.\n\n\"It's all about information,\" Sorokas said. \"You can't beat going firsthand and seeing it. I've heard so many things about it; I want to clarify it in my mind.\"\n\n\"It's important to learn about all sides of this important issue,\" said Vinsko, a Democrat who plans to a 2012 challenge to Republican Lou Barletta in Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.\n\n\"In order to make informed decisions, I wanted to hear from the landowners on both sides of the issue. I also plan to meet with the gas companies to get all sides of the story, but this is an important first step.\"\n\nAt least one trip participant had already made up his mind about the issue. Throop Borough Council President Tommy Lukasewicz said he has been fighting against the efforts of Keystone Sanitary Landfill to increase its daily intake by 2,500 tons, which would allow it to accept more solid waste from the gas drilling industry.\n\n\"I agree more than anyone here probably that this is the worst thing that could happen to Northeastern Pennsylvania,\" he said, adding that he believes gas drilling could reverse the progress the area has made in erasing the scars left 50 years ago by coal mining.\n\nLukasewicz, who attended Mansfield University and often drove through Bradford County to get there, said he \"wanted to see firsthand what an area (he) had known about looks like now.\"", "title": "Light Your Water On Fire from Gas Drilling, Fracking", "publishedDate": "2011-12-10T22:41:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4LC-qjmjj78", "description": "Relive the best moments of Rock en Seine festival in Paris with iConcerts.

A game save progress bar will show you the status of your game saves. You will also be able to easily tell what games and apps are being updated or have been updated recently.\nFriends improvements. Notifications will be added to see when favorites and friends sign in to Xbox Live. This was one of the most frequently requested features, so we made it a priority to include it in this update. Also, friends who are in multiplayer will be identified in the friends list.\nKinect voice and motion improvements will continue to be fine-tuned for quality and reliability of Xbox One commands. For example, we've updated some of the gesture functionality to reduce false positives on non-hand objects triggering gesture commands.\nImproved GameDVR video quality through compression algorithm improvements.\nBlu-ray player supports 50 Hz video output for content recorded at 50 Hz. We'll also be updating the Blu-ray Player app in the coming days to round out these improvements.\nController and headset adaptor firmware updates will reduce audio static and improve wireless connectivity.\nSilent reboot after system updates and system update on demand now available. If your console is in Instant On mode, the update will happen automatically and return to standby upon completion. This means you won't need to power on your console after an update moving forward. If you want to take future updates when available without waiting for your console to do it on its own, we've added this option under system settings and you'll be able to use it next update. It will only show as available when there is an update to take. \n\noutro\n\nMusic: Olumide - OG Ogunnubi (OG Bobby Johnson Remix)\n\u279c http://soundcloud.com/michaelxe/olumide-og-ogunnubi-og-bobby\n\nMusic used with permission for commercial purposes by any.TV for all Freedom! partners\n\u279c http://www.freedom.tm/music", "title": "Xbox One April updates (Trials Fusion Gameplay)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-16T22:15:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4LVYfRuMQec", "description": "Me covering a song by Deadmau5 from his new EP \"7\".

He  was described by a colleague as a man who's nerves had been broken by the time he died in Normandy killed aged 24 instantly by an almost invisible fragment from a shell blast.\n\nThe Poem speaks through the eyes of a dotard so traumatised that there is no awakening them from their vacancy of mind...The first world war poet Wilfred Owen touched upon this theme in a similar fashion in his poem \"Mental cases\".... \n\nKeith Douglas was the son of a British army officer had studied literature at Oxford university under the ww1 poet Edmund Blunden he is deservedly remembered for his almost metaphysical style in which he often described graphicaly the horrors of war and is among my favourite poets and one I have a great feeling of affinity with. In this wonderful sad touching poem \"How to Kill\" His phrase \"How easy it is to make a ghost\" very much encapsulates the message in this poem of how a mosquito like bullet can so easily take away a life.Alas he knew this all to well Keith Douglas began to publish his verse in periodicals in the 1930s, while he was still studying at Oxford; however, the only volume to be published in his lifetime was 'Selected Poems' (1943). He was killed in Normandy. His reputation rests mainly on his war poetry, particularly that depicting the desert warfare he experienced in North Africa. The unquiet intensity of this piece is reminiscent of that found in some Elizabethan 'metaphysical' poetry. Keith Douglas was born in Kent, and educated at Oxford University under the tutorship of poet Edward Blunden, before enlisting with the British Army when World War II broke out. He is the most famous English poet of that war, although he began publishing his work at the age of 16. His verse is precise, unsentimental and at times chilling, in its treatment of desire and sexuality as well as in its pervasive obsession with death and the relation of death to writing. Douglas was killed in Normandy, having also written about his involvement in the war in North Africa, his slim but intensely powerful corpus concluded at an early age. His work began to receive the acclaim it deserves only when Ted Hughes, a great admirer, edited and introduced a collection in 1964 (Selected Poems). See also the more recent Complete Poems (ed. Desmond Graham; 1978). \n\nKind Regards.\n\nJim Clark...\n\nAll rights are reserved on this video recording copyright Jim Clark 2014\n\nDotards......\n\nDotards do not think\nbut slowly slowly turn\neyes that have seen too much\nexpecting the soft touch\nof fate who cannot burn\nbut is a last drink\na night drink, an opiate\nand almost comes too late.\nI who could feel pain\na month,a month ago\nand pleasure for my mind\nand other pleasure find\nlike any dotard now\nam wearily sat down\na dull man, a prisoner\nin a dull chamber.\nYou who richly live\nlook at me, look at me;\nstirred to talk with you\nI speak a word or two\nlike an effigy\nwhat answer will you give?\nCan you wake the drugged man\nI wonder if you can.", "title": "Keith Douglas \"Dotards\" Poem animation World War Two Soldier Poet", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T10:58:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4LtJscmnQEE", "description": "Seriously...wtf?", "title": "Woman gets punched in face.

Forming in 1989, Suffocation quickly released their 3-song debut Re-incremation. Within weeks of its existence came the interest of many labels who wanted to claim stake to the first full length album. Suffocation takes the rhythmic relentlessness of hardcore beats, put them into speed metal structures and overlaid off-time counterpoint structures. The band's first release \"Effigy of the Forgotten\" moved Suffocation to a new plane, taking the multiple languages of music and unifying them in an evocative, thundering chorus of death metal.\n\n--------\nSubscribe to Scion AV for more exclusive videos from your favorite artists! - http://awe.sm/bFiIN\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/scionav\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/scionav\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/scionav\nhttp://www.scionav.com", "title": "Suffocation - \"Abomination Reborn\" [Live @ Scion Rock Fest 2012] (Scion AV)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-27T22:23:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MBLyHlTe6c", "description": "This Song Is Called Mouse In The Coal Bin, I like It (:", "title": "Morgan Playing Cool Halloween Song", "publishedDate": "2010-06-16T02:45:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MBZ8ZR276U", "description": "Southern Boy and his daughter are headed out on quads - after taking Inebriate Hangover Free the night before.", "title": "Quadding after Inebriate", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T07:18:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MBhoHCK9ps", "description": "Improve  your English  and master the language by increasing your Vocabulary with this easy to  learn and fun  voice based channel that brings you a word from the Oxford Dictionary   to familiarize   you with new  words  and make it easy for you to use in enriching your daily conversations.

I bought that in a guitar shop in San Francisco called Black Market Music. I really wasn't looking for it. We just went to a music store, maybe to get strings or something when I was on the road, touring, and I saw the guitar. I thought immediately of Mike Bloomfield, because on one of the Butterfield Blues Band records, there's a picture of him and Butterfield and he's playing this white Tele that looks just like that.\n\n\"So, I went over, picked it up and started playing it -- and I couldn't leave the store without it. Honestly, prior to that time, I never would have even considered a Telecaster. I never would have gone: 'I gotta go out and get me a Telecaster.'

The best part of it is that you don't necessarily have to know the answers to play.\n\nPlayers start by breaking off into teams of one to three players. Each team gets a dry-erase board and color-matching betting chips.\n\nEach team designates a questioner to draw a question to read aloud on its turn. Once a question is read, teams then write their answer on their dry-erase boards and place it face down on the table. All the questions have numeric answers. When every team has submitted their response, flip over the boards and order the responses from the highest to the lowest numbered guess.\n\nSimilar to The Price is Right, teams will then wager a guess on which answer is closest to the actual cost without going over the actual amount. Teams can place their wager chips on their own guess or on two different guesses. The teams that correctly guess closest to the actual number earn chips. That way, teams can earn chips for having the correct answer or by betting on another team's response.\n\nAs the game moves forward, teams can also use poker chips to increase their wagers. The game can be played in as many rounds as teams chose to play. Whichever team has the most chips at the end of the game wins.\n\nEach game includes seven dry-erase boards, six dry-erase markers, 14 betting chips, 25 poker chips, and 125 cards. The game is for four to 20 players and can be played with a maximum of six teams.", "title": "Wits & Wagers Party Edition from North Star Games", "publishedDate": "2012-08-13T18:41:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MbofsvSm4Q", "description": "An interesting design allows for this case to act as a stand, and unique case.

They are long-lasting and affordable. \n\nAs a busy mom of 5, on a budget, I cut out trips to the salon a long time ago! Now, for the first time in nearly 10 years, I have pretty nails! Join the Nail Revolution!\n\nThe story of Jamberry Nails begins with three sisters who possess distinct personal tastes, but share a love for style. After an expensive afternoon together at the nail salon, Lyndsey, Christy and Keri vowed to find a simpler, more cost effective way to keep their hands looking polished, while still spending time together. \n\nAfter lots of trial and error, the proprietary nail wraps of Jamberry Nails launched in late 2010. The DIY, at-home application and incredible variety of designs caught on quickly and sales soared. A new era of nail art was born. \n\nGone are the days of nails that chip and flake after only a few days! Gone are the days of mani/pedis that take all afternoon and most of your cash, too! Jamberry Nails arm you with style and confidence, while demanding very little of your time or money. \n\nNEW: Book online - http://noelgiger.simplybook.me/ \n\nFollow me on:\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/noelgiger/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/noelgiger\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/noelgiger \nFlikr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/noelgiger/\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/noelgiger \nPolyvore: http://noel-giger.polyvore.com/ \nTumblr: http://www.tumblr.com/blog/noelgiger\nRebelMouse: http://www.rebelmouse.com/noelgiger/\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/104905921637274205201\n\nRead my blog at http://www.noelgiger.com/\n\nIf you'd like to become a Jamberry Nails Consultant, we'd love to have you join the GLOW Girls! http://www.noelgiger.jamberrynails.net/home/join.aspx\n\nNoel Giger\nIndependent Director \nJamberry Nails\nwww.noelgiger.jamberrynails.net www.facebook.com/dfwjamberry\nnoel@noelgiger.com 469-583-4604\n\nI recorded this video for training purposes for my team, GLOW Girls. \n\nIf you are a Jamberry Consultant and wish to use this as training for yourself or your team, please feel free.", "title": "Jamberry Nails Fundraiser Packet", "publishedDate": "2012-08-08T16:05:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MiubN1oQkg", "description": "Product Page: http://www.harborfreight.com/tig-mma-inverter-welding-machine-with-digital-readout-98233.html\n\nDesigned for both TIG and arc/MMA welding applications, this welding machine welds Mild steel, low alloy steel, and stainless steel (not suitable for aluminum) (MMA: 18 gauge (3/8\" thick), TIG: 22 gauge (3/16\" thick).

It is one of the shortest Upanishads, containing only 12 verses. It's length however, has no bearing on the knowledge contained within it. In fact, the Muktikopanishad says that if a person cannot afford to study all of the Upanishads, it is enough to read just the Maandookya Upanishad.\n\nThe Maandookya Upanishad refers to four states of consciousness -- wakefulness, dreaming, dreamless sleep and the Absolute or Self, explained through the principle of AUM. AUM consists of three elements -- 'a', 'u' and 'm'. The 'a' corresponds to the state of wakefulness (jagrata), wherein one is aware of sensory experiences. The 'u' corresponds to the state of dreaming sleep (svapna), where the mind is the only thing that is awake. The 'm' corresponds to the state of dreamless sleep (susupti), where only the Atman is aware of this experience. The silence that follows the chant of AUM corresponds to the Fourth state (turiya).\n\nTuriya, which literally means \"The Fourth\" is the ultimate state of consciousness. It is the three preceding levels, yet it transcends them all. It is consciousness itself.", "title": "Sacred Chants - Mandukya Upanishad (Shloka 4)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-19T14:18:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MmsBP3pyVE", "description": "WATCH MORE VIDEOS ON http://www.youtube.com/user/theway2tawheed", "title": "Question to sheikh  Asim Al-Hakim (can dead people hear)  ,,,.", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T06:34:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MnkGNFz2sc", "description": "Altay Da\u011flar\u0131n\u0131n \u00dc\u00e7 Zirvesi Aras\u0131nda Oturan Ve Bozulmam\u0131\u015f Eski T\u00fcrk M\u00fczik K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc n\u00fcn Temsilcilerinden Olan Altay T\u00fcrklerine Ait Bir T\u00fcrk\u00fc.", "title": "''Atam\u0131n At\u0131'' -Altay T\u00fcrk\u00fcs\u00fc (Altay T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi)-", "publishedDate": "2012-06-06T00:23:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MnoxyVErM0", "description": "Jack Wilshere says the FA Cup win is for the fans who had to wait nine years for a trophy.\n\nHit the subscribe button for more Arsenal content! : http://www.youtube.com/user/ArsenalSupremo10\n\nSecond Arsenal Channel Subscribe now! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ArsenalSupremo14\n\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Arsenal_Supremo\n\nVisit Our Website - www.arsenalsupremo.com\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ArsenalSupremo", "title": "Jack Wilshere dedicates the FA Cup win to the Arsenal fans", "publishedDate": "2014-05-17T20:44:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Mo0k9RnKnc", "description": "DIY: LIMPEZA DE PELE COM ARGILA VERDE - Canal TOP\n\nELEVE A SUA BELEZA:\u00a0http://bit.ly/CANALTOP\nInstagram: @canaltopp\nTwitter: @canaltopp\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/canaltopp\n\nDIRE\u00c7\u00c3O \u2013 Rafael Castro\nEDI\u00c7\u00c3O \u2013  Rebecca Roche \"Becca\"\nPRODU\u00c7\u00c3O DE CONTE\u00daDO  \u2013 Alice Portugal \nDIRETORA DE PRODU\u00c7\u00c3O  \u2013  Alessandra Bezerra \nASSISTENTE DE DIRE\u00c7\u00c3O -- Rebecca Roche \"Becca\"\nPRODUTORA \u2013 Alessandra P\u00f4ncio\nCEN\u00d3GRAFA  \u2013  Thayn\u00e3 Lyasak\nFIGURINO -- Livia Porch\nP\u00d3S PRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \u2013 Clarissa Monteiro \u201cCissa\u201d\n\nO Canal TOP \u00e9 apresentado por Alice Salazar, Nayara Rattacasso e Rayza Nic\u00e1cio. \n\nBeleza?

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each.

Magnesium is a cofactor assisting enzymes in catalyzing most chemical reactions in the body, including temperature regulation.\n\n2. Magnesium produces and transports energy.\n\n3. Magnesium is necessary for the synthesis of protein.\n\n4. Magnesium helps to transmit nerve signals.\n\n5. Magnesium helps to relax muscles.\n\n1. COFACTOR IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS\n\nEnzymes are protein molecules that stimulate every chemical reaction in the body. Magnesium is required to make hundreds of these enzymes work and assists with thousands of others.\n\n2. PRODUCING AND TRANSPORTING ENERGY\n\nMagnesium and the B-complex vitamins are excellent examples of energy nutrients, because they activate enzymes that control digestion, absorption, and the utilization of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Because magnesium is involved with hundreds of enzymatic reactions throughout the body, magnesium deficiency can affect every aspect of life and cause a score of symptoms. Of the 325 magnesium-dependent enzymes, the most important enzyme reaction involves the creation of energy by activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fundamental energy storage molecule of the body. ATP may be what the Chinese refer to as qi or life force. Magnesium is required for the body to produce and store energy. Without magnesium there is no energy, no movement, no life. It is that simple.\n\n3. SYNTHESIZING PROTEIN\n\nMagnesium is used in synergy with dozens of other vitamins and minerals to create structural components of the body. Under the direction of magnesium, enzymes and nutrients modify the building blocks from food to create the body. Without magnesium, there is no body. RNA and DNA, which contain the genetic blueprints for the formation of all the protein molecules in the body, are also dependent on magnesium.\n\n4. TRANSMITTING NERVE SIGNALS\n\nMagnesium permits a small amount of calcium to enter a nerve cell, just enough to allow electrical transmission along the nerves to and from the brain, then forces it back outside. Even our thoughts, via brain neurons, are dependent on magnesium.\n\n5. RELAXING MUSCLES\n\nCalcium causes contraction in skeletal muscle fibers, and magnesium causes relaxation. When there is too much calcium and insufficient magnesium inside a cell, you can get sustained muscle contraction: twitches, spasms, and even convulsions. Smooth muscles directed by too much calcium and magnesium deficiency can tighten the bronchial tract, causing asthma; cause cramping in the uterus and painful periods; and cause spasms in blood vessels, resulting in hypertension.", "title": "Magnesium Health Overview", "publishedDate": "2011-06-15T20:48:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MyxsCSpumw", "description": "", "title": "Sing a Song", "publishedDate": "2009-04-22T02:37:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MzK5R4o5NY", "description": "One of our Street Teams missions was submitting fan made lyric edits and this is the result! :-)", "title": "Tolbooth OST - Parallel Fan Made Music Video", "publishedDate": "2014-06-20T11:48:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4MzZtlm0yhw", "description": "Especial emitido por el canal de deportes ESPN el 23 de octubre de 2011 en Goles de Europa ..

The most mysterious, stylish and sexual plant that you will ever meet.\n\n'A Crafty & Malignant Antediluvian Vegetable' is how Arum was described by the Victorians and no wonder. This is a plant which is said to induce 'insatiable sexual desire' and has multiple orgasms as part of its reproduction. It has mythical links with serpents, death, creation and sexuality. It is included in the first ever encyclopaedia and in the remedies of a Welsh healing family who say they were taught by the fairy folk. Legends tell of its power to rouse bears from hibernation and how its pollen glows at night giving it the name of 'fairy lamps'.\n\nKnown as Cuckoo Pint, Stallions and Mares and Dog's Dibble, amongst a host of other local names, Arum Maculatum has always stirred our imaginations. The unmistakable sexual suggestiveness carried in its curves has led to it being universally considered a powerful aphrodisiac. Reflecting this bawdy sexuality the plant has inspired over 150 common names in English alone: more than any other British plant.\n\nTo know the Wild Arum is to steep one's self in the history of our ongoing relationship with plants and to delve into the very roots of herbalism and botany. It is to go on a journey which begins in ancient Greece with the earliest herbal manuscripts ever written and a single book which was in continual use for over 1500 years. It ends with the latest research into the genetic evolution of plants. It is to step into the intimate relationship between powerful plants and our own evolution, taking in along the way the first herbal guides, much myth and folklore, Elizabethan high fashion, rampant plagiarism and hibernating bears. It's quite a story.\n\nContaining over 100 stunning photographs showcasing this unique British plant, the Secret Life of Lords and Ladies explores the history, the mythology and the fascination which this plant has held for us since ancient times.", "title": "Wild Arum", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T18:01:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "4N6KClp4YWk", "description": "Roger Valine is the former president and CEO of VSP Vision Care.", "title": "CA Fwd TV: Roger Valine on public service", "publishedDate": "2010-12-01T23:27:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4N6h949GnmU", "description": "Causas y soluciones para la alopecia androgen\u00e9tica en los hombres.

Pain, frequent urination, vulvar pain, backpain, fibromyalgie, migraine, tiredness, pain with intercourse, all these can make your life miserable and are all linked to the painful bladder syndroom.\n\nInterstitial cystitis (IC), also known as painful bladder syndrome, bladder pain syndrome and hypersensitive bladder syndrome, is a debilitating, chronic, inflammatory bladder disorder of unknown cause, with symptoms of pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be related to the bladder and usually associated with a frequent and urgent need to urinate day and night. While the symptoms may resemble bacterial cystitis, there is no infection to be seen in the urine and tests reveal no identifiable disorder that could account for the symptoms.\n\nif we take a biopsy of the bladderwall we see chronic inflammatory cells and especially the so called mastcells. These cells are there at war, but sadly enough there is no enemy. Normally the enemy would be a bcteria. Why this low grade inflammation has been triggered we do not know. But the same 'shit' happens in chronic prostate pain.\n\nThis war without an enemy, leading to the chronic painsyndrome in the bladder, can be treated with a natural and bodyown anti-inflammatory compound, which also has painkilling properties. This molecule has the fancy name palmitoylethanolamide, or easier with a brandnames, PeaPure. In 1992-1995 the Nobelprice laureate professor Rita Levi-Montalcini focussed on this substance to easy chronic pain and normalize the war-behavior of these mast cells. (She was at that time 87 years old, and she is evn now still bright and alive....) Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide brings to rest overactive nerve cells which are irritated in all chronic painsyndromes.\n\nPalmitoylethanolamide has been explored and tested in more than 10 clinical trials in various chronic pain states, even in endometriosis pain. It has been proven to be safe and effective. Palmitoylethanolamide has now been used now by more than 1.000.000 patients, most of them in Europe, and the compound is easy to use, has no troublesome side effects and can be used safely together with other drugs. Als for older patients there are no issues of drowsiness to be expected. The branded formulations are Normast and PeaPure. PeaPure contains pure PEA without chemical excipients.\n\nWe recommend to use PeaPure for at least 6 weeks, dose 1200 mg/daily, as the supplement needs time to reset this chronic painstate via a natural mechanism called the PARR receptor as well as via the normalization of the mast cells.\n\nIC is more than we think; associated disorders more commonly occurring in PBS/ IC patients than in the general population are:\n\nallergies\nirritable bowel syndrome \ninflammatory bowel disease\nsensitive skin\nvulvodynia....\nfibromyalgia", "title": "Painful Bladder Syndrome, what it is and how to treat", "publishedDate": "2011-06-11T21:41:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4N8DKUD7N2Y", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Heil david", "publishedDate": "2013-06-23T19:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4N8Pv601sQw", "description": "Learn more http://clarysagecollege.com\n\nThe Esthetics program at Clary Sage College can prepare you to work in a salon, spa or medical clinic performing a variety of services.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource :-Wikipedia\n\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Take a piece of card stock; I've cut mine in half and we're going to fold it in half for the base page.  Match the edges and the corners together and crease it really well.\n\nNow for a pull tab it actually goes underneath the base page; so we're not going to open it up like a pop up. The mechanics are actually going to go inside here and this is the backing piece to cover it.\n\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to mark a slot on the base page about an inch and a half wide and an eighth of an inch tall. Our pull tab is going to come through there. Take the Exacto blade and very carefully cut out a slot. Take another piece of card stock. Make sure it is just under the height of  your base page. This one is a little tall so I'm going to trim it down in a minute but we also want to make sure this piece is a little smaller than the slot we've just created. What I'm going to do is underneath the slot I'm going to put the second piece of card stock underneath, line it up so you can just barely see the edge of this piece. I'm going to mark where the slot is so I have a good idea as to how wide the pull tab is going to be. I'm going to make it a little smaller than what we just marked.\n\nTake a pair of scissors and cut right on that mark all the way to the top. Mine was a little too tall so I'm just going to knock off about a quarter inch. Now we have what's going to end up being the pull tab.  If we slip it underneath we can see that's going to be the pull tab; that's going to pull down and it's going to push back up. \n\nFor this one I'm actually going to make a little mouth, very much like a little puppet. I'm going to cut out a rectangle and I'm going to close it up again. I'm going to mark on the back of the base page where that square is. We're just going to fill that in, outside of the lines, with a pencil or a marker or a darker shade of paper. You can now see the opening. When I put my pull tab in there you can see that it covers it.  It opens and closes, opens and closes. But it's wobbly right now so when you have pull tabs you're going to have to anchor it down. Next I'm going to show you how to secure the pull tab to the back of the card.", "title": "How to Make a Pull Tab | Pop-Up Cards", "publishedDate": "2012-02-09T16:54:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Nitt2TdREs", "description": "Tune in Saturdays at 9/8c on OWN.\n\nAfter working one-on-one with Saigon and Erica Jean, who star on Love & Hip Hop: New York, Iyanla brings them together to build a new foundation as successful co-parents.

He became an anchorite before being elected abbot of Bath Abbey. His perceived piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the episcopate, and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. \u00c6lfheah furthered the cult of Dunstan and also encouraged learning. He was captured by Viking raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. \u00c6lfheah was canonised as a saint in 1078. Thomas Becket, a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c6lfheah_of_Canterbury\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - \u00c6lfheah of Canterbury", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T00:49:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NlxKzKgiuM", "description": "http://www11.nrk.no/urort/artist/Philter/default.aspx", "title": "Philter - Breakdown Into 8-Bit", "publishedDate": "2008-12-09T12:17:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NnEJQd_nSA", "description": "Pasca Nikita Mirzani Dikeroyok Vs Jupe Jambak Jambakan @ Pesbukers", "title": "Julia Perez Jupe Vs Nikita Mirzani Jambak-Jambakan @ Pesbukers", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T21:25:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NnK95IGG0Y", "description": "Plume d'autruche extrait du projet Pronostic disponible en t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuit sur http://www.jehkyl.com\n\nProd & Mix par Flev\nEnregistrement au CamouflageStudio\n\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/jehkyl\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Jehkyl_", "title": "Jehkyl - Plume d'autruche (Prod & Mix Flev) [PRONOSTIC]", "publishedDate": "2013-01-21T20:58:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NnMnqif9Gs", "description": "In this video, we take a close look at the Soler & Palau Silent 100 4\" mains voltage bathroom fan.\n\nSIL100S: http://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/soler-palau-hi-power-silent-bathroom-fan-sil100s-3189-p.asp\n\nSIL100T: http://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/soler-palau-hi-power-silent-bathroom-fan-with-timer-sil100t-3191-p.asp\n\nSIL100HT: http://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/soler-palau-hi-power-silent-bathroom-fan-with-humidistat-sil100ht-3193-p.asp\n\nSIL100PIR: http://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/soler-palau-hi-power-silent-bathroom-fan-with-occupancy-sensor-sil100pir-3195-p.asp\n\nDucting, grilles and accessories: http://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/ducting-grilles-and-accessories-27-c.asp", "title": "Soler & Palau Silent 100 bathroom extractor fan", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T10:58:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NnjIosYHnQ", "description": "Wyst\u0119p nowotarskiej kapeli punk-rockowej Zg\u00f3rMySyny na koncercie w Suchej Beskidzkiej - Pub Skorpion - 08.04.2011.", "title": "Zg\u00f3rMySyny - Ruchol", "publishedDate": "2011-04-26T18:28:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NnqXJ3WhmE", "description": "La inte ner s\u00e4rskilt mycket tid p\u00e5 redigeringen, men kanske g\u00f6r det till n\u00e4sta, tack f\u00f6r mig! :)", "title": "CS:GO - Cows sneaky Ninja defuses  #1", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T16:43:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NofVeBonYY", "description": "edc by ESPRIT Damen Loose Fit Bluse slip over Kundenrezensionen\nKlicken Sie auf den Link unten auf der Seite, um mehr Kunden Kritische Bewertungen und Bester Wert zu erhalten:\nhttps://googledrive.com/host/0B4x-dcLNu8kddjZ5UWV4b3ctY1E/biogroutcinarcarelatini1989.html", "title": "edc by ESPRIT Damen Loose Fit Bluse slip over Kundenrezensionen", "publishedDate": "2014-10-16T20:33:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4NolX8XxTPg", "description": "Dive into Nova Southeastern University in sunny South Florida, the nation's 10th largest private not-for-profit university with 150 degree programs including associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctorate, and first-professional programs.

Katz wants to put the findings of the Diabetes Prevention Program to work in every town in America.\n\nTopic: The Diabetes Prevention Program.\n\u00a0\nDavid Katz: One example of the kinds of programs and the power that we have coming\nfrom the research community is the diabetes prevention program. The diabetes prevention program took 3,500 or so adults with pre-diabetes, so we're really on diabetes' doorstep, and randomly assigned them to one of three treatments: usual care, drug treatment with a drug called Metformin or Glucophage, and the lifestyle intervention arm. And this study was funded by the NIDDK which is one of the institutes at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to the tune of 174 million dollars; big study, important study. It was stopped early after 4 years because the results were so dramatic.\n3,500 adults who were going to get diabetes soon. The drug worked very well. It actually prevented diabetes in 30% of those high risk adults; so almost one in three, who would've gotten diabetes without that treatment didn't. Pretty good. The lifestyle intervention however, prevented diabetes in 58%. It was twice as good. Now what was this? Was this some very creative diet? Only eat rutabaga under the light of the full moon while standing on one foot?\nBalanced, sensible nutrition: eat food, not too much, mostly plants, a healthy diet ala Michael Pollan, modern physical activity on a daily basis, modest weight loss -- translated into a 58% reduction in the occurrence of diabetes. A clear indication of the power of lifestyle over health. The challenge now and many people are working on this, is the development of the community-based programs that will translate what we learned in the diabetes prevention program and put it to work in every town in America. How do we make this play in Peoria? Or New Haven, Connecticut where I come from? Or any other town?\nSo in our case, we took that program which clearly is the best practice, there's an educational program attached to the DPP. We said if we can find an inexpensive way to make this infiltrate the community, maybe we can see some of those gains in diabetes prevention where we live.\nSo we developed a program called \"PREDICT -- Partners Reducing the Effects of Diabetes Initiatives through Collaboration and Teamwork.\" This was funded by the centers for disease control. We worked with African-American churches in New Haven and Bridgeport, Connecticut, to identify leaders in the congregation in the community who would become pure educators. So we trained them in diabetes prevention. We taught them the lifestyle arm of the diabetes prevention program and then we said \"Pay it forward. You know your community. People listen to you. People respect you. If you care about this and you're knowledgeable, you can reach people that we probably can't.\" Coming from academia, they distrust us. You really need to be part of community.\n\u00a0\nRecorded on: July 06, 2009", "title": "Grassroots Health: Communities Paying it Forward", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T01:20:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "4O0C9ofc__w", "description": "'Ded na si Lolo' is one of the official movie offerings for The 1st Philippine Film Festival in the UAE, to be held on November 25-26 in VOX Cinema Dubai City Centre, VOX Cinema Marina Mall Abu Dhabi and workshop venues.

They are made of 100% colorfast polyester and they meet U.S. product safety standards for flammability (FF1-70). This soil resistant rug will add beauty and superior protection beyond your hearth extension season after season. A polyester rug will char but WILL NOT burn if a hot log or ember falls on them. \n\nWool rugs offer the most design and color options and 100% wool rugs provide style and protection for your hearth that you can count on. The advantage to wool is that it is naturally self-extinguishing and if it does char, the spot can often be rubbed away leaving little visible damage. Meets the CPSC standard (FF 1-70) for flammability of carpets.\n\nFiberglass rugs are the safest option for you fireplace or hearth as the embers will not burn the fiberglass face of this rug. Fiberglass does not support fire so if a log or ember lands on the hearth rug it will just burn out. Don't let your floor or carpet be ruined by flying embers from your fireplace.

The Griswolds are going on vacation. In the driver's seat is Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), an Everyman eager to share the open road and the wonders of family togetherness. Myriad mishaps, crude kin (Randy Quaid), encounters with a temptress (Christie Brinkley), financial woes, Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) on the roof, one security guard (John Candy) and 2,460 miles later, it's a wonder the Griswolds are together. There's never been a family vacation like it. Except maybe yours.
