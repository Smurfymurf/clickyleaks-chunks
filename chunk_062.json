G. Jung (1875- 1961) \u2014 a concept which has remained, even to a great number of those familiar with Jung's intricate psychology - esoteric knowledge.\n\n  Jung, who was the founder of Analytical Psychology, first introduced the term synchronicity in 1930. His principal essay on this subject \"Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle\"\n\n  The concept of synchronicity is based on the idea that the individual, through the unconscious, has access to an \"absolute knowledge\" which is not bound by the limitations of space or time. Jung's primary source of material for this hypothesis was to be found in his study of dreams especially those which were of a parapsychological nature.\n\n  The synchronicity phenomena indicate that the unconscious is able to transcend the space and time factors as they are known to us. With respect to the former, it would seem that space has been transcended when, for instance, one has an accurate inner knowledge, possibly in the form of a dream or fantasy, that a friend, who is living hundreds of miles away, has suddenly taken ill. This type of synchronistic experience is not at all uncommon. With respect to the time factor, it would seem that it too can be transcended. The synchronistic experiences which are of a precognitive character demonstrate this quite well.\n\n  Jung's concept of synchronicity provides, therefore, an image of a psyche which, not being restricted by the limitations of space and time, participates in the events of nature as a whole.\n\n  With the hypothesis of synchronicity, Jung felt he had achieved, from the point of view of psychology, an understanding of the nature of the phenomenal world that was analogous to that of modern physics. Both had achieved an understanding of reality that went beyond our everyday notions of solid bodies, empty space, cause and effect, space and time. Physics understanding of this new frontier was for the most part quantitative in that it was expressed mathematically. Jung's understanding was, in contrast to this, principally qualitative in that it addressed the problem of \"meaningful parallels.\" \nBoth views, Jung had hoped, would eventually come together creating a new unified scientific model \u2014 a new world view linking the psychic and the physical. It is a scientific goal which, given the limited knowledge of psychology and physics, is at present unattainable.\n\nEffect without  a cause \nSub-atomic laws, scientific pause \nSynchronicity", "title": "The Police - Synchronicity 1 + lyrics", "publishedDate": "2010-11-27T02:34:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2rZToVfr0a4", "description": "\"La Migration Bigoudenn\" est un court-m\u00e9trage d'animation r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par 3 \u00e9tudiants de Gobelins (l'\u00e9cole de l'image) : Eric Castaing, Alexandre Heboyan et Fafah Togora.\n   \nLa production du film s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e de mars \u00e0 juin 2004 pour un film d'une dur\u00e9e de 2 minutes.

And in the SEC, that coin is carried by the bag man, a fan who believes he's leveraging football success $500 or $50,000 at a time.\n\nLast week, SB Nation posted a great long-form article on the shadow-world of bag men paying paying college football players. \n \nA college football bag man can draw attention to himself, but never importance. He will never be famous or be the annoying rich guy hovering next to the coach right after a big game. \n\nBag men operate in clandestine spots like the Waffle House. They talk in person as much as possible and stay out of the public eye. Like drug dealers, they carry lots of burners.\n\nThey don't have an FDIC-insured bank account, but a pool of money can be accessed quickly for things like large single sums to convince a recruit to sign or maintenance payments to current players.\n\nBag men live close to campus so they can meet up with their players to give them frequent payments of $200 to $500. It's also easy to get used mid-range SUVs for players. \n\nThe way they see it, if you can help the team win games on the field and also help a struggling family out, then why not. It's called the SEC for a reason, it's about straight earning cash. \n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------------------------------\u00ad----------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The reaction between both partners results in a self decomposition of the educt. \nThis decomposition of ammonium dichromate yields a fluffy mixture of disperse chromium(III)oxide, some residual chromium chromates/ammonium dichromate. Further water and nitrogen are formed during the decompostion.\nThese fine dispersed chromium oxides are, due to the huge surface, good usable for catalysis-reactions, like the catalysed combustion of gaseous ammonia with airborne oxygen, where the fine dispersion causes this \"firefly\"-effect a similar reaction is achievable by the use of platinum, where a fine dispersion is a bit harder to perform with, due to the fine dispersion and the price of this catalyst.\n\nThe first experiment needs careful safety-precautions, because the fluffy product will spread around the whole workplace if handled unsafe. And this needs to be prevented, because not all the dichromate will surely decompose to harmless chromium(III)oxide.\n\nReaction equation for the first experiment:\n\n(NH4)2Cr2O7 \u2192 Cr2O3 + 4 H2O + N2\n\nReaction equation for the second experiment:\n\n4 NH3 + 3 O2 \u2192 2 N2 + 6 H2O\n\n___\n\nIn diesem Versuch wird der bekannte \"Vulkan\"-Versuch mit dem \"Gl\u00fchw\u00fcrmchen\"-Versuch verbunden.\nDie erste gezeigte Reaktion ist eine intramolekulare Reaktion, bei der beide Reaktanden, Oxidations- und Reduktionsmittel, bereits in der Ausgangsverbindung vorliegen. Die Reaktion der Bestandteile untereinander f\u00fchrt zu einer Zersetzung der Ausgangsverbindung.\nDiese Zersetzungsreaktion von Ammoniumdichromat f\u00fchrt zur Freisetzung einer feinverteilten Substanz, haupts\u00e4chlich bestehend aus Chrom(III)oxid, aber auch aus R\u00fcckst\u00e4nden von Chromchromat und Dichromat, und Wasser und Stickstoff.\nDieses feinverteilte Pulver ist aufgrund seiner gro\u00dfen Oberfl\u00e4che gut f\u00fcr katalytische Zwecke geeignet. Diese Eigenschaft wird im zweiten Versuch genutzt: Der katalytischen Verbrennung von Ammoniak zu Wasser und Stickstoff. Durch die feinen Chrom(III)oxid-Partikel entsteht der sichtbare \"Gl\u00fchw\u00fcrmchen\"-Effekt. Gleichsam w\u00e4re Platin als Katalysator nutzbar, was allerdings aufgrund der schwierigen Handhabbarkeit des fein verteilten Pulvers und der Kosten hinf\u00e4llig ist.\n\nDer erste Versuch erfordert gr\u00fcndliche Sicherheitsvorkehrungen, da bei unvorsichtigem Umgang das gesamte feinverteilte Produkt herumgewirbelt und so auf dem Arbeitsplatz verteilt wird. Dies muss unbedingt verhindert werden, da nicht alles vorhandene Dichromat sicher quantitativ zu Chrom(III)oxid umgesetzt wird.\n\nReaktionsgleichung des ersten Versuches:\n\n(NH4)2Cr2O7 \u2192 Cr2O3 + 4 H2O + N2\n\nReaktionsgleichung des zweiten Versuches:\n\n4 NH3 + 3 O2 \u2192 2 N2 + 6 H2O", "title": "Volcanogenic fireflies - Vulkanogene Gl\u00fchw\u00fcrmchen", "publishedDate": "2011-04-10T14:03:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2s-poshOJJE", "description": "El cambio de guardia en M\u00f3naco", "title": "Rel\u00e8ve de la Garde des Carabiniers du Prince", "publishedDate": "2008-02-15T22:55:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2s01Lpx0xyU", "description": "Clatsop County's beaches are a hot spot for razor clams, which have adapted to dig vertically in the sand so they can survive our wild winter storms.

I only added one room in this version but the video is now HD.\n\nThis is a level I've been working on for the PC game America's Army using the supplied level editor (a modified version of UnrealEd).\nThe first section of the level is a 720 degree circle. It's basically a long hallway curled up into a double-circle-type shape, with the ends connected. Sorta like if you take a rubber band and double it up, except the whole band/hallway takes up the same small area.\nThe second area is the impossibly long hallway. At first glance it appears that it's just a small room with column in the center. Upon further examination, however, the \"hallway\" connecting the back of the room is many times longer than could ACTUALLY fit there. Imagine it as \"squishing\" a hundred feet of hallway into a one-foot space.\nThe third area is the room in a closet. The closet only appears to be a couple feet deep and wide, however the room inside it is about a hundred feet both ways. Now step into the closet. The room you just walked out of is now contained neatly in the same small area the closet originally occupied.\nThe fourth area is a long hallway with a small closet at each end. Walking into one closet causes you to walk out of the opposite one. Think of it as a little shortcut. \n\nTry wrapping your head around these spaces!\n\n(By the way, this was done with UnrealEd's Zone Portals and WarpZoneInfo nodes. The level is comprised of a bunch of unconnected rooms connected by zone portals. See the following link for more information.)\n\nhttp://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Legacy:WarpZoneInfo\nMap can be downloaded here: http://tonyfox.ws/files/AmericasArmyNonEuclidean.zip\n\nNote: I Don't know if it works in the latest version of AA2 (2.8.5), but it definitely does work in 2.8.3.

It is enhanced with the antioxidant power of Pomegranate and Green Tea, blueberry, and the absorption bene\ufb01ts of Ionic Minerals. This elixir uses Agave nectar as a low glycemic index sweetener.\nAs we age, the HA content in our bodies naturally decreases. One way this decrease manifests is from UV radiation which breaks down collagen \ufb01bers causing wrinkles and sagging skin. \n\nHyaluronidase, an enzyme produced by free radicals, is an enzyme that also breaks down collagen \ufb01bers. HA counteracts this enzyme by plumping the inner layers of the epidermis in a more effective way than topical HA application alone; by hydrating the skin from the inside, HA creates a more youthful skin environment, thus reducing wrinkles.* \n\nHA is found in high concentrations in the joints. HA's unique property of high viscosity, and therefore low compressibility, provides vital shock absorption and lubrication to the joints. * \n\nEye problems such as poor vision and dry eyes can also manifest when HA decreases in the body. HA is an important constituent of the ocular tissue and is essential for normal functioning of the eye. *\n\nIn the body, Collagen and HA are almost always found together. Collagen provides the mechanical strength of connective tissues and HA, with its ability to bind enormous amounts of water, serves to lubricate these same tissues providing needed hydration. By supplementing with Collagen and HA, you give your body a powerful synergistic team for beautiful skin and healthy connective tissues.*\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NeoCellCollagen\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoCellHealth\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/neocellcorp?feature=CAQQwRs%3D", "title": "REVIEW: NeoCell /HYALURONIC ACID BLUEBERRY LIQUID", "publishedDate": "2013-11-22T19:13:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sJJNsTzgFM", "description": "Screen Gems Frances Yip Concert Live in Genting 2011", "title": "Shanghai Beach - Frances Yip", "publishedDate": "2011-05-18T11:48:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sJmsHLHF8I", "description": "Visit:  http://www.WorkersCompensationConference.com", "title": "Scrutinizing Claims for Work-Relatedness", "publishedDate": "2014-08-15T09:23:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sJz2ZLQTmE", "description": "Nov\u00e1 Ty Nikdy deska Paulie Garand - V hlavn\u00ed roli je pr\u00e1v\u011b te\u010f v prodeji. \n\nBli\u017e\u0161\u00ed info zde: http://bit.ly/OHkC7j\n\nDesku kupuj zde: http://bit.ly/SHnMu0\n\n#vhlavniroli\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://tynikdy.cz\nhttp://pauliegarand.cz\nhttp://facebook.com/tynikdylabel\nhttp://twitter.com/tynikdylabel\nhttp://soundcloud.com/tynikdy\nhttp://tynikdy.bandcamp.com", "title": "Paulie Garand - VHS feat.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - Giant Convict Chichlids Guard Eggs - 2007", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:45:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sOOSrMa1uI", "description": "", "title": "GCT backbencher", "publishedDate": "2011-10-24T06:31:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sPGDcU9BEQ", "description": "", "title": "Goethe! - Johann und Lotte", "publishedDate": "2012-01-08T16:12:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sPJSGDhpho", "description": "SoulPancake hit the streets to discover stories of unexpected generosity.\n\nShot by: Andrew Nakama, Jean Louie Larrieu\nSound:  Jason Meadows\nEdit: Brandon Riley Miller\nColor: Robert Crosby\n\nSubscribe to our youtube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=SoulPancake      \nBuy our book! http://book.soulpancake.com\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/SoulPancake\nTweet us at: http://twitter.com/SoulPancake\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/soulpancake", "title": "Unexpected Generosity - Man On The Street", "publishedDate": "2013-05-28T23:00:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sPJX9_ExjE", "description": "Sherqi Turkistan - East Turkestan - Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan Uyghur Turks Songs.\nYurt - Vatan\nUyghurche Naxsiler", "title": "Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan Vatan \u015eark\u0131s\u0131 - Uygur T\u00fcrkleri M\u00fczikleri (Vaten)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T15:34:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sPNy-Ax9Vo", "description": "Do you want to see more LEGO Speed Build videos from BrickBuilder?

That profile has now been removed, along with the comments about the mosque. But the police investigation is still going on and is being forwarded to provincial hate crime investigators.\n\nVicPD says over the weekend investigators interviewed the person they believe made posts.\n\nThe Canadian Coast Guard promised a statement on the issue three days ago.  Today, it refused to comment, but says Speed is not an employee.  The agency referred all other questions to the Commissionaires.\n\n\"The individual is suspended at this time with pay pending the outcome of (our) the investigation,\" says Dewar \"If we find he's in violation of our policies then we will take action, up to and including dismissal.\"\n\nVictoria Police say the Muslim community is satisfied with how the department is handling the case and say the Facebook poster is remorseful about his comments.\n\n\"The individual is remorseful and feels bad about making the post,\" says Sergeant Michael Brown \"But, we are not done examining who this person is, and this individual's background.\"\n\nPolice say they can't know for sure whether the threats are genuine, but they have to take them seriously. \n\nAt this point it's not clear whether charges will be laid. \n\nFollow Stephen Andrew on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/CTVNewsStephen", "title": "Hate Crime Considered in Mosque Comments", "publishedDate": "2012-08-21T19:39:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sS-WzRAjQo", "description": "O Clone", "title": "O Clone - Jade tenta reconquistar Sa\u00edd", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T17:57:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sSRZsgRy8U", "description": "Rodolfo \"Dolph\" St. Tenedor was known far and wide for never pulling off a single successful wedding before lust and carnage took over.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Eating living octopus in korea for dinner", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T21:21:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2somXHYFJZ0", "description": "", "title": "ulex..", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T21:24:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sowclrcb0Q", "description": "This is how to get out of the map ( Fountaine futuristics on the campaign .. jus follow exactly as i do ..\n( note ) this is the easy way out of the map there are 2 ways this one and another the other one is way harder and i have to go back in order to record it..\nit will be up soon..", "title": "BIOSHOCK 2 :: How to get out of :: Fountaine futuristics ::", "publishedDate": "2010-03-21T09:36:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2spEOt3jVa8", "description": "The biggest crashes from Round 7 of the 2013 PETRONAS AAM Malaysian Cub Prix Championship held at Temerloh, Pahang from 5 - 6 October.\n\nWE DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE MUSIC.\nMusic created using loops from Apple Garageband.\n\nhttp://www.malaysiancubprix.com \nhttp://facebook.com/MalaysianCubPrix\nhttp://twitter.com/msiancubprix", "title": "Round 7 Temerloh - Biggest Crashes - PETRONAS Malaysian Cub Prix Championship", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T08:45:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "2spFQ6t2vrU", "description": "Track #10", "title": "Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon - Giotto, The Great King", "publishedDate": "2010-03-02T16:25:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2spQ0IP7R2o", "description": "http://analogmusicstudios.com/bullion-chords/ for chords/Tabs", "title": "Bullion (Acoustic)- Millencolin cover", "publishedDate": "2008-04-30T19:11:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2spfUCzM7X0", "description": "Fourth of July at the Larkspur-Corte Madera parade. #MarinFourth\n\nBy: Jen Upshaw Swartz - City editor | Marin Independent Journal\nPublished on: July 4, 2014\nSource: http://www.tout.com/m/4oz9ao", "title": "Fourth of July at the Larkspur-Corte Madera parade. #MarinFourth", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T18:12:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2spzowAsZIY", "description": "Le gusta observar a la gente", "title": "Tupinambis Merianae (Lagarto Overo)", "publishedDate": "2007-12-10T16:33:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sq2fu_gmVE", "description": "In 2023, the Bentham Grid goes online. \nDirected by: Dennis Liu\nWritten by: Ryan Condal\nProduced by: Jonathan Hsu, Dennis Liu", "title": "Plurality - Official Trailer [HD]", "publishedDate": "2012-05-30T12:28:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sq2xdrF7bo", "description": "Nuffield 4/60 Hay Turning", "title": "Nuffield 4/60 Hay Turning", "publishedDate": "2011-09-03T19:05:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2sqMLSd68Jg", "description": "Sam Smith - Latch Cover\nCover by Aaron Encinas\n\nHope you enjoy my cover of \"Latch\" by Sam Smith\n___________________________________________________\n\nFollow Aaron Encinas and Megan Meade\nAaron Encinas\nTwitter | http://www.twitter.com/AaronEncinas @AaronEncinas\nFacebook | http://www.facebook.com/AaronEncinasMusic\nInstagram | @AaronEncinasMusic\n\nMegan Meade\nInstagram | @meganmeade\n\nFilmed+Edited by\nCody Hadden\nInstagram | @codyhadden\n\nProduced by\nLineau Andrade\n___________________________________________________\n\n\"Latch\"\nSam Smith\n\nYou lift my heart up when the rest of me is down (never)\nYou, you enchant me even when you're not around (never)\nIf there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down (never)\nI'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found (never)\n\nI feel we're close enough\nI wanna lock in your love\nI think we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love, baby?\n\nNow I got you in my space\nI won't let go of you (never)\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you (never)\n\nNow I got you in my space\nI won't let go of you (never)\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you (never)\n\nI'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch (never)\nFeel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch (never)\nHow do you do it, you got me losing every breath (never)\nWhat did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest (never)\n\nI feel we're close enough\nI wanna lock in your love\nI think we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love, baby?\nI feel we're close enough\nI wanna lock in your love\nI think we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love, baby?\n\nNow I got you in my space\nI won't let go of you (never)\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you (never)\n\nNow I got you in my space\nI won't let go of you (never)\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you (never)\nLatching on to you\nI won't let go of you (never)\nLatching on to you\nI won't let go of you\n(Never let go, never let go)\n\nSam Smith - Latch (Acoustic) Cover\n___________________________________________________\n\nTags:\nLatch, Sam Smith, Dispatch, SNL, Aaron Encinas, Megan Meade, Lineau Andrade, Cody Hadden", "title": "Latch - Disclosure ft.

The Nuclear Medicine Stress Test is frequently ordered when a person is not able to walk on a Treadmill with enough vigor, such that they can reach the clinically significant Target Heartrate. The Nuclear Medicine Stress Test has a duration of several hours. A Radio-Isotope is administered through an Intravenous Access. This Radio-Isotope has an affinity, or attraction to the Heart Muscle Cell, the Myocyte. The Radio-Isotope is given a specified amount of time to reach the Myocardial Cells of the Heart. At this point the Heartrate is increased via the administration of a stimulating medicine, also through the Intravenous Access. A Scan starts at this point, with the Scanner being able to detect the \"breakdown\" of the Radio-Isotope.

This fast, fun, and free framework supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, targeting the open web via HTML5 Canvas. This course shows you how to put Phaser to work: creating a multistate game that can be played on both desktop browsers and mobile devices. After you gather your assets, author Joseph Labrecque will help you start a new game project with the Brackets code editor, create a basic preloader and menu states, and then start building game entities and layering in functionality with Phaser's sprites, groups, animations, tweens, emitters, and physics. He'll also show you how to provide feedback to the player and add sound effects for a more immersive gaming experience. When you're done, Joseph shows you how to prep the game for a mobile launch.\nTopics include:\n\n-Downloading the Phaser framework\n-Creating your first Phaser project\n-Building the preloader and menu states\n-Creating and spawning entities\n-Working with particles and emitters\n-Detecting and handling collisions\n-Detecting \"game over\"\n-Adding sound effects and text\n-Preparing for mobile deployment\n\nYou can download the exercise files for this course here\nhttp://www45.zippyshare.com/v/77709122/file.html\n\nYou can view Virus scan for the uploaded file\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/901422770c7e64c261d37a746bed3b446609c7b06edbc6d23a2db2b328c97c23/analysis/1407866810/", "title": "HTML5 Game Development with Phaser by LYNDA-Choosing a code editor", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T18:14:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2tMmE6uRy9M", "description": "#VJUKE is a project from Touch Sensitive and visual artist Ego, who crowd-sourced clips via Instagram to create a one-off audiovisual track.

Border, Raquel Caballes Maxwell, Don Phillips, Joel Soisson\nScreenwriter: Gregory Widen\nFilm Description: The directorial debut from Highlander screenwriter Gregory Widen stars Christopher Walken as the angel Gabriel, who, fed up with God giving all of his attention to humans, decides to stage a sort of coup. With plans of killing all of the good angels, Gabriel decides to enlist the help of a recently deceased and inhumanly malevolent army general. In order to prevent Gabriel from obtaining the help of the vicious Korean War vet, good angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) stashes the general's soul in an unsuspecting young Native American girl named Mary (Moriah Snyder). As Gabriel gets closer to finding Mary, an ex-seminary-student-turned-cop and a school teacher, played by Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen, team together to protect her. Meanwhile, Satan (Viggo Mortensen) enters into the mix, concerned over the implications the heavenly war may have on his dominion. Later spawning a series of sequels, The Prophecy was released in the U.K. under the title God's Army.\n\n\"the prophecy\",\"the prophecy clip\",\"the prophecy club\",\"the prophecy trailer\",\"christopher walken\",\"viggo mortensen\",\"virginia madsen\",\"elias koteas\",\"moriah shining dove snyder\",\"gregory widen\",\"musical instruments videos\",\"cult horror\",horror,\"satanic stories\",\"supernatural horror\",\"joel soisson\",\"wk border\",\"don phillips\",\"raquel caballes maxwell\",\"life and death videos\",\"power videos\",\"success videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++134878,/m/016fjj,/m/073w14,/m/050zr4,/m/01ps2h8", "title": "The Prophecy (11/11) Movie CLIP - Time to Go Home (1995) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T07:45:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2tQe1QfCb5E", "description": "Deutschlands bester FMXer bei seinem Run im Steinbruch Oetelshofen und was er danach zu sagen hat.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS. \n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "North Carolina vs Clemson | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T03:32:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "2tZ9sVwODYo", "description": "Maak eenvoudig uw eigen buttons met onze Pigmy buttonmachines! http://www.buttonsmaken.nl/buttonmachine/pigmy-buttonmachine-online-bestellen/pigmy-25mm-buttonmachine-bestellen U kunt deze machines om buttons te maken bestellen voor 25mm buttons, 38mm buttons, 45mm buttons en 56mm buttons.\n\nBekijk al onze buttonproducten op http://buttonsmaken.nl\n\nWij maken ook buttons v\u00f3\u00f3r u!

Dependent on the thickness of the masonry and degree of moisture penetration the pressure injection method provides for this purpose. Here holes are drilled every 10--12.5 cm centres into the masonry. The bore holes are drilled level in the horizontal pointing or positioned at a 45 degree angle. The depth of the bore hole should be approx. 5 cm less than the thickness of the masonry. The injection material is injected under pressure into the substrate using appropriate injection packers. In this way the injection material is pressed into the pores in the building material and forms a hydrophobic (water repellent) level so that moisture can no longer be transported upwards by the capillaries. In case of a low degree of water penetration injection using pressureless techniques is possible.", "title": "Protection against capillary rising damp - Restrospective horizontal damp proof barrier", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T14:58:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2tlZbDpSpX4", "description": "The Defense Department has announced that thousands of soldiers \u2014 many serving as commanding officers in Afghanistan \u2014 will be getting slips telling them their service is no longer needed.

But ethyl alcohol is ethyl alcohol whether it's fermented from\ngrapes, barley, or agave\u2014or in the case of sanitizer, corn or the\nscience lab. There's no evidence to support the popular notion that\ndifferent kinds of alcohol incite different moods while drunk. But it's\npossible that nonalcoholic ingredients in your beverage could alter\nyour inebriation or hangover. About 8 percent of the population is\nallergic to something in red wine, and research suggests the\nmain culprit may be organic compounds which share traits with\nallergens found in fruits, nuts, and latex.\n\nHard alcohol can also contain toxins,, including acetone, furfural,\nand polyphenols. One study found the particular byproducts of\nfermentation in each kind of booze can play a role in the severity of\nhangovers. Subjects were given either bourbon or vodka (masked\nwith a cola mixer) one night and a nonalcoholic placebo another night.\nThe bourbon drinkers woke up feeling slightly worse, on average, than\nthe vodka drinkers.\n\nYour mixer matters too: Researchers have found that drinks made\nwith diet cola are more likely to produce drunken vomiting than those\nmade with regular cola. Hand-sanitizer, for its part, contains mostly\nalcohol and water, so fermentation byproducts are unlikely to be an\nissue.

I'm going to show you some really cool techniques for beginning crochet, and hopefully, you'll have as much fun as I have with it. Okay, lets get started. \n\nSo now, we're going to do the half double crochet. It's the second highest stitch that exists out of the 4 basic stitches. So we're gonna do it into our chain. This step is important. We need to skip some chains. And the nber of chains you skip for the half double crochet is 2. So we're gonna count them away from the hook. You're gonna start at the loop on your hook, and that doesn't count as anything. And we're gonna count each V, like, little V shapes away from the hook. So there's one, where my yarn's coming out of. The next V or space is 2. So the third here, is where I'm going to go in with my hook. So step 1 of the half double crochet is yarn over the hook. And that's just bringing that yarn from back to front over the hook. And that's the same way that you always yarn over in crochet. I'm going to insert under that third chain from the hook now. The yarn comes back over the hook. And I'm gonna bring that yarn through the chain onto the hook itself. So at this point, we have 3 loops on the hook. And the last step in the half double crochet is yarn over again. And bring it right on through all 3 loops. At that point, it helps to kind of grab right at the base of those loops, and gently pull down as you're sliding through with your hook. And that just opens those loops up, and makes it a little bit easier for you to do that motion. So one more time. We're going to yarn over the hook. Insert under the next chain. Bring the yarn over the hook. And pull it through the chain onto the hook. So you now have your 3 loops. We're going to yarn over again, and bring it right on through all 3. So that's the half double crochet. What you're going to do is work that across every chain to the end. And then definitely check out the churning video to see what happens next.", "title": "How to Do a Half Double Stitch | Crocheting", "publishedDate": "2011-07-20T20:02:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uGGCB3XR6s", "description": "Szczeg\u00f3\u0142y na stronie: http://www.kocham-zabawki.pl\n\n\u201e\u015awie\u017co upieczona\" Ksi\u0119\u017cniczka Zosia i jej \u201elataj\u0105cy\" ko\u0144 Minimus chc\u0105 dosta\u0107 si\u0119 do kr\u00f3lewskiej lataj\u0105cej dru\u017cyny je\u017adzieckiej, zupe\u0142nie jak w serialu animowanym Disneya!\nGdy dziewczynki przypn\u0105 Zosi\u0119 w siodle rumaka i b\u0119d\u0105 nim porusza\u0107 w d\u00f3\u0142 i w g\u00f3r\u0119, ko\u0144 zacznie macha\u0107 skrzyd\u0142ami i b\u0119dzie wygl\u0105da\u0142, jakby lata\u0142 z Zosi\u0105.

There has been doubt about the level of cooperation that chimpanzees are able to spontaneously achieve or understand. Would they, without any pre-training or restrictions in partner choice, be able to develop successful joint action? And would they be able to extend cooperation to more than two partners, as they do in nature? Chimpanzees were given a chance to cooperate with multiple partners of their own choosing. All members of the group (N = 11) had simultaneous access to an apparatus that required two (dyadic condition) or three (triadic condition) individuals to pull in a tray baited with food. Without any training, the chimpanzees spontaneously solved the task a total of 3,565 times in both dyadic and triadic combinations. Their success rate and efficiency increased over time, whereas the amount of pulling in the absence of a partner decreased, demonstrating that they had learned the task contingencies. They preferentially approached the apparatus when kin or nonkin of similar rank were present, showing a preference for socially tolerant partners. The forced partner combinations typical of cooperation experiments cannot reveal these abilities, which demonstrate that in the midst of a complex social environment, chimpanzees spontaneously initiate and maintain a high level of cooperative behavior.", "title": "Chimpanzees Cooperative Behavior", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T20:00:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uHLVLtvlSI", "description": "batalla Kike JiMenez y Polo Rojas - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla The Shams vs Diamantina - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla The Shams vs Diamantina - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla CLAYTON vs Marcela Galvez - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla Daniela Pedali vs Silvia Rivera - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla CLAYTON vs Marcela Galvez - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla Kike JiMenez y Polo Rojas - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla Hansen Flores vs Mike miramontes - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla ricky martin y camila cantan \"perdon\" - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla Frank Di vs Christopher Robin - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\nbatalla Par de Ases vs Christian Salazar - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion HD\nbatalla The Shams vs Diamantina - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion\n\nla voz mexico 2014 nueva temporada\nla voz mexico cuarta temporada\nrepeticion de la voz mexico domiengo 26 de octubre 2014\nbatallas de la voz mexico 26 octubre 2014\ncapitulo la voz mexico completo 26 octubre 2014\nver la voz mexico completo\nla voz mexico 2014 nueva temporada\nla voz mexico cuarta temporada\nrepeticion de la voz mexico domiengo 26 de octubre 2014\nbatallas de la voz mexico 26 octubre 2014\ncapitulo la voz mexico completo 26 octubre 2014\nver la voz mexico HD", "title": "batalla Kike JiMenez y Polo Rojas - la voz mexico 26 de octubre repeticion", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T07:35:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uHSv1asFvU", "description": "(1979) Ayn Rand discusses Israel and the Middle East on Donahue.\n  \nPlaylist for the full video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx-LpRSbbeA&feature=PlayList&p=CD63BCE86EA89F8B&index=0&playnext=1", "title": "Ayn Rand on Israel and the Middle East", "publishedDate": "2009-03-28T15:18:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uHZNoAdcwY", "description": "Music Video by The Yule Logs.

The freedom to speak up, express yourself, reach out and be yourself! \n\n \n\nThe fun, effervescent personality of the brand can be seen through this lively jingle which captures the essence of Jazz in a mere 90 seconds. Music to our ears, this catchy new jingle went through many iterations before taking its final form. The jingle touched upon many of our USPs as it drove home the message of affordability and our comprehensive array of Value added services and coverage. The ROI is already becoming apparent as one notices people tapping their feet as soon as the jingle comes on air.\n\n \n\nBringing together some of brightest stars of the Pakistani industry in this magnanimous production, the legacy of Jazz continues even stronger than ever before.  Reuniting characters that span the breadth of communications that have come from the Jazz platform, the various characters depict the diverse customer base that Jazz has cultivated since its inception and illustrate that irrespective of one's age, creed, language or gender, Jazz is the one connection for all. Famous personalities such as Fawad, Annie and the evergreen Wasim Akram bring this commercial to life, displaying their youthful side which indeed is a treat to watch. \n\n \n\nThe television commercial was supplemented with a unique and powerful print campaign that has already created waves. The print campaign had two phases of which phase one built upon the core message of the freedom that Jazz provides, whereas the second phase drove home the various USPs that Jazz offers i.e. they showcase not only our remarkable call rates, but our expansive coverage and bouquet of exceptional value added services, as well, confirming the fact that we are indeed the market leaders. \n\n \n\nThese striking images have blanketed the nation as Jazz rolls-out one of the most comprehensive launches in the recent past.

Not much new medical material to work with so I've gone back to a song from their debut album entitled \"Dorsal Horn Concerto\", showing how easy it is to confuse your patients by using the technical medical terminology at every opportunity.\n\nA little note: as a graduate of Latin and Greek, I have the urge to mention that on the whole, medical terminology is approximately 50% of each language - perhaps there is slightly more Greek. I would say that anatomical vocabulary is more likely to be from Latin whereas diseases are more likely to be Greek. The lyrics following \"the Latin word instead, like:\" are in fact Greek. Drs Adam Kay and Suman Biswas, I'm sure, know this but of course the word \"Greek\" was not going to fit where a two-syllable word was needed. Good ol' scansion. Well I miss learning these ancient languages, but they have helped me understand what my own doctors are saying to me! For those who have even the remotest bit of interest in any of this, I recommend a book by Donald M. Ayers called Bioscientific Terminology: Words from Latin and Greek Stems. I am so sad! lol\n\nAnyway, enjoy, and please check out my other AmTran videos, if you haven't already. \n\nThis video is my first HD one, first widescreen one and my first experience of editing using Windows Live Movie Maker. I would say that it is easier to get timing right in the live version than in the original Windows Movie Maker, but is less flexible. Still, hope I have done the song justice.\n\nDorsal Horn Concerto is a parody of \"Rondo\" (3rd movement) from Horn Concerto No. 4 in E flat major K495 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The Sixers\u2019 Thaddeus Young would also join the T-Wolves with Anthony Bennett off to Philly. \n\nWith Love in the mix, the Cavs become an immediate contender for the championship in a weak East with a new Big 3 of Lebron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. \n\nGot to feel for Wiggins, though. After all the hype that comes with being the first pick and thinking you\u2019re going to play with Lebron to then ending up in Minnesota minus Kevin Love. Like Wiggins said, though, the NBA is a business.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nDaily videos brought to you by THE Taiwanese Animators behind the infamous Tiger Woods animation.

The building materials are all readily available and cheap, with the big expense being the concrete foundation that's needed to bolt the panels to.\n\nThe panels are highly insulated and make for comfortable temperatures inside year round, saving up to 50% on energy costs compared to other building styles. I also chose a cool and breezy mountain-foot site to build. I have 3 solar photovoltaic panels and 2 wind generators for power, connected to a sinewave inverter.\n\nI was initially going to make a much smaller house, but quickly realised that the panels were so cheap that adding another room and a large verandah wouldn't increase the cost much at all. If I need more space in the future, I can close the verandah and turn it into another room.\n\nBecause we didn't use a skeleton frame, the house has to be a bungalow.

Popular example of this kind is an attempt to apply Gosper algorithm to the rational or quasi-rational summand: in such cases running time can be exponential in the input size, even if the result has the size polynomial in the input size. We will present a set of new algorithms that overcomes this long-standing deficiency in the theory and practice of the indefinite summation, in particular new effective rational summation algorithm, based on shiftless factorization of polynomials and synthetic division in the ring of linear difference operators. Similar approach is applied to improve quasi-rational summation algorithms, replacing Gosper algorithm.", "title": "Accelerating indefinite summation Part 1-a", "publishedDate": "2011-11-06T19:19:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2updgeZMq-c", "description": "Learn about the fundamentals in this online meteorology course.", "title": "Meteorology 101 - UniversalClass Online Course", "publishedDate": "2009-06-26T21:40:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uplQ291D5o", "description": "", "title": "Seminarian Parkour", "publishedDate": "2013-12-22T01:44:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uptcAGe-_M", "description": "http://www.judovision.org", "title": "[O100kg] Andreas Toelzer (GER) - Yevgeni Sotnikov (UKR).wmv", "publishedDate": "2009-05-22T13:19:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2upyt6zx29g", "description": "", "title": "forgive our slovenly kitchen...", "publishedDate": "2012-06-23T13:30:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uq3fGkvtBM", "description": "When Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil) seeks shelter from the wilderness in a secluded cabin in the New England countryside, he is given one explicit instruction: No matter what he hears, he cannot go outside.

On one side of the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang--Mills theories that describe elementary particles. On the other side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - AdS/CFT correspondence", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T02:17:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uuqxoT90U8", "description": "C\u2019Cauet sur NRJ de 19h \u00e0 22h !

They were sold at the two wholesale clubs and food market. While no illness has yet been reported, consumers are being urged to not eat the fruit as Listeria can bring on serious illness and even potentially death.\n\nSeniors, pregnant women and children and anyone with a weak immune systems are at the most risk for Listeria. Listeria can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. The infection symptoms include nausea, stiffness, severe headache, diarrhea, high fever and abdominal pain.\n\nThe food markets have been contacted, according to Wawona, and the produce is being pulled from the shelves. The recall was trigged by an internal test result. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the factory packing lines have been shuttered and equipment has been replaced.\n\nThe FDA says subsequent testing has revealed that any Listeria issue is gone at this point.\n\nThe fruit in question was packed between June 1 and July 12.\n\nThe FDA has listed photos of the packaged fruit for consumer view. Visit here \nhttp://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm405945.htm\n\nWegman's, a Rochester supermarket, is also issuing a recall on the Wawona fruit, telling customers not to eat the \"Sweet 2 Eat\" organic and regular white and yellow peaches as well as black plums and nectarines. The recall also involves baked goods at Wegman's made with those fruit products and sold between June 1 and this past Sunday.", "title": "Listeria contaminated fruit details", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T10:05:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uyoq0n4AAU", "description": "Completamente loco por sentir tu alma, mirar en tu corazon, estar en tus pensamientos, tocar tus recuerdos, loco por volverte a ver, loco por habitar en tus sue\u00f1os, loco por sentir tus labios, loco por ti, porque te amo y siempre te amare. \u00a9\n\nTemporal de amor - Leandro y Leonardo Letra\nUbicame en Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lLucianol", "title": "Temporal de amor - Leandro y Leonardo Letra", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T01:59:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2uzRCtrPh5c", "description": "A quick ride in a Ram Power Wagon with video from three vantage points.

There also used to be Wattled curassow, but these are no longer registered with ISIS, so I am not entirely sure what has happened to them.\n\nThis species is one of two species of whistling curassows.  The other being the wattled curassow.  This species is one of four crax curassows with yellow facial skin, but this one has the characteristic yellow knob on it's bill.

If you're just starting off, this is a good problem to have. It means that you're out there, you're doing something and you're coming across houses that either have a lot of snow that hasn't been shoveled or, now that it's spring time, you're going to be seeing houses with grass that's knee high. Let's look at some of the avenues you can take to find the owner of a vacant property.\n\n1. Check the owner's mailing address on the tax records.\n\nNow there's two slots for the address: one slot is for the actual property and the second for the mailing address. If that mailing address is different from where the property is located, then you've just figured out where that owner lives.\n\n2. Leave a note or reverse bandit sign.\n\nIf the owner lives nearby and he checks up on the property once a month, or once a quarter, even if he's out of state \u2014 if you leave a note there, he's bound to get it, take a look at it and hopefully he'll reach out to you that way.\n\nYou can also leave a reverse bandit sign. This is a tactic that I use where on my bandit signs (where it says \"we buy houses\"), I flip it around and use a sharpie to write \"Interested in buying your house. Call me.\" The phone number is already on the other side so if he's interested, he'll definitely see a yard sign in his lawn and he'll reach out to you.\n\n3. Send a letter to the property. It may forward to the owner.\n\nRemember, in #1 we were sending it to the mailing address, but what if the mailing address and the property address are the same? The reason you want to do this is because the post office gives you about a year worth of time to forward letters over. So if that forwarding is still in place within that year, that letter\u2014even though you sent it to the property\u2014will forward over to where the owner is living.\n\n4. Talk to the neighbors.\n\nBe active and be proactive. Go around and knock on doors and talk to the neighbors. I would talk to the guy on the left, right, behind and front \u2014 whatever it takes until people start telling you \"I've never talked to that guy!\" \n\nThis worked very well for the house that my parents live. I actually had my dad go over and talk to the neighbors. All he did was say, \"Hey listen, we know this house is vacant, it's an eye-soar for the neighborhood, and all we want to do is try to buy it or have a family that's going to move into it.\" And then my dad gave my business card to that neighbor and she said, \"You know what, listen, I know this neighbor pretty well. She left me her new address and her phone number. I'll give her a call and explain to her what you said. And if she's interested, she'll call you.\" And sure enough, just by that action, that 5 minutes my dad took to talk to the neighbor, I was able to get a phone call and we secured that deal for 50% of market value.\n\n5. Hire a skip tracer.\n\nIf you're still working a 9-5 job and don't have time to do any of the above, hire a skip tracer and they'll take care of it. I've seen skip tracers that are able to provide email addresses, Facebook accounts, phone numbers. and at the very least, where that owner is living. \n\nThere you have it! Now get out there and look for more vacant properties!

At times it seems like we spend more time at the sink than we do actually holding our baby. The Philips AVENT Sterilizer can make this chore a bit easier. While there are certainly things that I like about this sterilizer there are other attributes that really limit how often (and long) we can use this product \n\n**** This sterilizer will warp sippy cups***** \n***** We have difficulty/ it is impossible to use with large bottles***** \n\nThe first attribute is not the fault of Philips, since the sterilizer produces steam in semi-pressurize environment it accidently melts/warps some plastic items. I mentioned sippy cups, but it also melted a new coffee thermos that I wanted sterilized. \n\nThe second point doesn't make much sense, but Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 3 Pack, 8 oz are too big to be used in this sterilizer. This is a bit of a head-scratcher as to why they made a device that is about 1/2\" too short to accommodate a very common type of bottle. \n\nA few other notes \n\n- Very, very easy to use and set-up. Grandma will have no problem learning how to use this sterilizer \n- Takes up a lot of counter space - more than a standard coffee maker. \n- Be careful with placement, the exiting steam may ruin your wood cabinets \n- The directions are poor, and while it is easy to set-up it would be nice if the directions demonstrated how everything fits together. \n\nFinal verdict - This is a great product for parents with children less than 6 months, however it quickly becomes obsolete as your child moves into bigger bottles and sippy cups.\n\nI received this item for reviewing purposes", "title": "Philips AVENT Electric Steam Sterilizer - Perfect for sterilizing AVENT baby bottles", "publishedDate": "2012-02-08T01:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vBBeSche4k", "description": "Get the beard wax here: http://oxhorn.it/best-beard-wax\n\nRead my guide to using beard wax, and see more beard wax brands: http://www.growabeardnow.com/beard-wax/\n\nHow to Use Beard Wax\n\n1) After you dry your beard, open your tin of beard wax and scrape off a good thumbnail-sized dab of beard wax with your thumb.\n\n2) Rub the wax into the palm of your hand until it melts.

Thankfully, beard wax is much easier to melt than mustache wax, so you should have no problem. Once the wax is melted, rub your hands together.\n\n3) Apply it to your beard by swiping your hands in a downwards motion on the front of your beard. Do this over and over again until you get the beard wax all over the front of your beard.

Su nombre se debe a que posee forma de saco.\nSe ha descubierto que el saco vitelino desempe\u00f1a funciones important\u00edsimas en el desarrollo embrionario. Adem\u00e1s, se sabe que este anexo es la primera fuente sangu\u00ednea del embri\u00f3n, con lo cu\u00e1l se transforma en un constituyente vital para el embri\u00f3n, sin el cu\u00e1l no sobrevivir\u00eda.\nEl saco vitelino est\u00e1 cubierto por una delgada capa mucosa y una pared m\u00e1s interna rica en vasos sangu\u00edneos que ser\u00e1n aportados al comunicado embrionario.\nLuego de la gastrulaci\u00f3n, el saco vitelino queda suspendido y sostenido del cuerpo embrionario, con lo que da forma al conducto vitelino.\nMediante el desarrollo fetal, y principalmente a partir de la 9 y 10 semana de desarrollo, el saco vitelino comienza a degenerar de manera natural por diversas causas, como su compresi\u00f3n debido al aumento del espacio ocupado por el amnios. Durante el periodo temprano del desarrollo embrionario, el saco vitelino es la estructura de mayor dimensi\u00f3n, con una forma ovalada, pero que con el desarrollo, adquiere una apariencia periforme.\nNo se conoce cu\u00e1nto tiempo permanece activo el saco vitelino.\n\nIt is the first element seen in the gestational sac during pregnancy, usually at 5 weeks gestation. It is a critical landmark, identifying a true gestation sac. It is reliably seen early in human pregnancy using ultrasound.\nThe yolk-sac is situated on the ventral aspect of the embryo; it is lined by extra-embyronic endoderm, outside of which is a layer of extra-embryonic mesenchyme, derived from the mesoderm.\nBlood is conveyed to the wall of the sac by the primitive aorta, and after circulating through a wide-meshed capillary plexus, is returned by the vitelline veins to the tubular heart of the embryo. This constitutes the vitelline circulation, and by means of it nutritive material is absorbed from the yolk-sac and conveyed to the embryo.\nAt the end of the fourth week the yolk-sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped vesicle (umbilical vesicle) opening into the digestive tube by a long narrow tube, the vitelline duct.\nThe vesicle can be seen in the after-birth as a small, somewhat oval-shaped body whose diameter varies from 1 mm. to 5 mm.; it is situated between the amnion and the chorion and may lie on or at a varying distance from the placenta.\nAs a rule the duct undergoes complete obliteration during the seventh week, but in about two percent of cases its proximal part persists as a diverticulum from the small intestine, Meckel's diverticulum, which is situated about 60cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus.\nSometimes a narrowing of the lumen of the ileum is seen opposite the site of attachment of the duct.", "title": "The yolk sac o saco vitelino en un embarazo de 6 semanas de edad Gestacional.", "publishedDate": "2008-12-17T17:37:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vKoDRVvcAY", "description": "The girls of Berry Bitty City put on a pet show - who will win?\nVisit Strawberry online at http://strawberryshortcake.com\nWatch Strawberry Shortcake on The Hub! http://hubworld.com\nFriend us on Facebook! http://facebook.com/StrawberryShortcake", "title": "Strawberry Shortcake - The Mystery of the Disappearing Dog Show", "publishedDate": "2013-02-28T15:02:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vKvZyTYqbs", "description": "", "title": "Jinghpaw Kasa 3", "publishedDate": "2011-07-08T19:53:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vLO6h4xOtA", "description": "Written and directed by Jill Soloway (\"Six Feet Under,\" \"The United States of Tara\"), \"Transparent\" revolves around Maura (\u201cArrested Development's\" Jeffrey Tambor), a transitioning woman who comes out to her three grown children.

De rollade is van oorsprong een mooie manier om geen vlees te verspillen. Maar inmiddels is het een feestmaal op zich, waar hele mooie stukken vlees in worden verwerkt in tal van (kruiden) variaties. \n\nGrenzeloze rollades\nVlees oprollen en met touw vastbinden gebeurt zeker niet alleen in Nederland. In Duitsland eet men bijvoorbeeld Rollbraten (altijd varken), in Engeland de rolled roast (vaak juist rundvlees), in frankrijk de Roti de porc, al dan niet gebraden in melk, en in Itali\u00eb de carne arrotolata. Zeker in de laatste variant gaat het vlees vaak vergezelfd van rijke vulling. Groenten, kruiden, champignons, maar ook kaas of fruit: een creatieve kok of slager weet wel raad met rollade.\n\nWelk vlees?\nDe moderne Nederlandse rollade bestaat uit grotere stukken van de rug of de buik waar alle beenderen, overtollig vet en zenuwen uit vewijderd zijn. Een rollade kan van alle vleessoorten worden gemaakt: rund, kalf, lam, kip of kalkoen.

You can even plan your hair style. Use http://www.Polyvore.com to help create outfit collage ideas. Save them on your computer, and keep them in a dated folder, or pin them onto Pinterest for future outfit ideas. \n\n3) Mix & Match Price Points-\nExpress your style within your budget. Shop eBay for new or pre-owned items. Thrift stores, and poshmark have some great options too. Mix your classic (more expensive) pieces, with treasures you find at a lower cost.\n\n4) Use A Tailor-\nI use a tailor for some of my jeans, skirts, special occasion dresses, or anything that doesn't fit quite right. A proper fit is key to looking and feeling your best in your clothing. \n\n5) Take Good Care-\nRead the labels, and follow the instructions on how to clean your clothing. Use detergents that are gentle, and do not strip clothing of it's color or texture. Follow the guidelines for drying and ironing also. Try using a steamer ( http://bit.ly/1svJq93) instead of an iron. \n\nOther GREAT items for clothing care-\nVelvet Hangers http://bit.ly/1vlfSgU\nVelvet Touch Clips http://bit.ly/1wcUngg\nIndoor Folding/Drying Rack http://bit.ly/1vlfWx4\nHonest Detergent http://bit.ly/1vCUHbo\n\nClothing Items In This Video\nAnn Taylor Edgy Trench Coat http://bit.ly/1xvG8qV\nAnn Taylor Pebbled Signature Crossbody Bag http://bit.ly/YKvbTQ\nHouse Of Harlow Stackable Rings http://bit.ly/1xvKEpi\nBangles Ebay.com\nNecklace/Bracelet Ebay.com\nNars Audacious Lipstick http://bit.ly/1vsA1QQ\nFaux Fur Coat http://bit.ly/YEPoKo\nVegan Leather Skirt http://bit.ly/1Cs4frb\nKaren Walker Sunnies http://bit.ly/1nlrpsy\n\n\u2665MY WEBSITE: http://www.RachelTalbott.com\n\n\u2665TWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/racheltalbott\n\n\u2665INSTAGRAM: http://followgram.me/racheltalbott\n\n\u2665MUSIC CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/user/SingingProudAndLoud\n\n\u2665VLOG CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/user/RachelTalbott\n\n\u2665HUBBYS COOKING CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/ByronTalbott\n\n\u2665FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/rachel.talbott\n\n\u2665MAILING ADDRESS: 18653 Ventura Blvd., #655, Tarzana, CA 91356\n\n* DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed are true &my own.
