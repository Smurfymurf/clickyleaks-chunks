Iranian nation is one of the Oldest Continuous Civilizations in the World. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic populations occupied caves in the Zagros and Elburz mountains. The earliest civilizations in the region descended from the Zagros foothills, where they developed agriculture and animal husbandry, and established the first urban cultures in the Tigris-Euphrates basin in present day Iraq. The earliest urban peoples in what is today Iranian territory were the Elamites in the extreme southwest region of Khuzestan. The arrival of the Aryan peoples\u2014Medes and Persians\u2014 on the Iranian plateau in the first millennium B.C.E. marked the beginning of the Iranian civilization, rising to the heights of the great Achaemenid Empire consolidated by Cyrus the Great in 550 B.C.E. Under the rulers Darius the Great and Xerxes, the Achaemenid rulers extended their empire from northern India to Egypt.\nDown to the present, one pattern has repeated again and again in Iranian civilization: the conquerors of Iranian territory are eventually themselves conquered by Iranian culture. In a word, they become Persianized.\n\nArt\nIran has one of the richest art heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and stonemasonry. There is also a very vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art scene.\nIranian art has gone through numerous phases of evolution. The unique aesthetics of Iran is evident from the Achaemenid reliefs in Persepolis to the mosaic paintings of Bishapur. \n\nThere are several languages spoken in different parts of Iran. The predominant language and national language is Farsi  Persian, which is spoken across the country\n\nReligion in Iran \nZoroastrianism was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the Arab conquest. It has had an immense influence on Iranian philosophy, culture and art after the people of Iran converted to Islam\nFollowers of the Baha'i faith comprise the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran.  Most of the Baha'i are of Persian descent, although there seem to be many among the Azerbaijani and Kurdish people. The Baha'i are severely persecuted\nPersian Rugs\n\nIn Iran, Persian Rugs have always been a vital part of the Persian culture\n\nThe Persian Garden was designed as a reflection of paradise on earth; the word \"garden\" itself coming from Persian roots. The special place of the garden in the Iranian heart can be seen in their architecture, in the ruins of Iran, and in their paintings\nCuisine:\nCuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: nan and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called \"tenurs\"). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. \n\nNowr\u016bz ( \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632, IPA: [nou\u02c8\u027eu\u02d0z], \"New Day\", originally \"New Light\") is the name of the New Year in Iranian calendars and the corresponding traditional celebrations. Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\n\n\nRabbits Born in Custody of San Diego County Department of Animal Services (SPCA Pet Killers & Animal Abusers) starved to death, and California spent over $100,000 to cover up their officer's crime, In Charge Lieutenant Lt.

I apologize that we were unable to film the actual attack.  We asked the wolves to recreate the scene but they were unwilling.  For those of that care to read more of the encounter, please continue... \n\nMy hunting partner and I set up on an elk trail at 3:00 pm.   We waited for elk for til 7:00 pm.  We did not bugle or cow call in this area at anytime, nor did we have any elk scent on us.  At 7:00 pm the sun set so we decided call it quits.  We signaled each other and walked to the ridgeline.  With only one pair of binoculars we glassed the opposite hill side and talked about the morning hunt.  We were only glassing for a few minutes before my partner heard some breaking twigs.  While I was glassing, my partner turned to look at three wolves running at us full bore.  One wolf (black) came directly at us while the other two wolves flanked on either side.  The direction they approached from would have given us 100 yards to see their advance,  but we didnt see them until they were 25 yards away. They were covering some ground.  As I was turning to my partners call of WOLVES!, he fired a broad head, missing the wolf's head by only a few inches (he may have had given him a shave).  When I turned, I saw the black tail of a wolf trotting away and caught a glimpse of a huge gray wolf lurking in the thicker timber to our left.  It was at this point that we both said, hey dumba$$ maybe we shouldnt have left our packs and quivers where we were sitting.  With one arrow and no side arm we walked toward the hidden but vocal gray wolf to retrieve my partners pack and quiver.  I was walking toward the gray wolf while my partner watched our backs.  We were able to get our packs without any more trouble, but the gray wolf was barking and howling the entire time, as heard in the video.  Once we had all of our gear we began the video before we headed back to the truck.\n\nAccording to a IF&G Biologist the wolves charged to invoke a flee response.  This is known as \"prey testing\".  The wolves didnt make contact only because we held our ground.  Had we of fled like their typical prey the wolves would have been on us from all sides.  This one of their primary elk hunting techniques.\n\nThe alpha male howling in this video was significantly larger than the other two wolves.  The alpha male had flanked to the left while the other wolf attacked.  \nAs we returned to the truck, in fading light and thick cover, the alpha male maintaned his distance close behind us while barking and howling out of sight.  There was a point when the alpha stopped howling.  This is when the pack, located between us and the truck,  began howling.  We estimate, by sound, that the pack contained 7 to 8 dogs.  As we approached the pack, near the road (1000 yds), the pack eerily went silent. We stopped and also went silient.  From the opposite side from teh pack the alpha male let out a loud howl.   Feeling surrounded and pressured at this point the we aggressively worked through horribly thick burned timber armed with two useless bows,  a machete, and skinning blade.  Sooner than we though we made it to the road, 200 yeads from the truck.  Once to the road we didn't hear the wolves again.\n  \nThere was no blood shed on either side.  We will be more prepared for wolf encounters in the future.  Both of us had wolf tags.  Neither of us had a sidearm (left them in the truck), but we will both be carrying them on all future hunts and hikes.", "title": "Idaho Wolves", "publishedDate": "2009-09-08T16:56:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k39gBJx1CU", "description": "Facil, Economico, y Delicioso!", "title": "Pollo en Crema de Chipotle", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T01:41:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k3Hlu1agZU", "description": "One of the 150+ brain healthy recipes included in The Grain Brain Cookbook.", "title": "The Grain Brain Cookbook- Slow Roasted Salmon with Mustard Glaze", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T12:38:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k3fpSh7G5g", "description": "", "title": "Filwoha 7th day adventist church chior.mp4", "publishedDate": "2008-12-03T16:48:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k3jFJhS8xk", "description": "Grab your copy on iTunes: http://www.smarturl.it/hamelin\n\nBellini Dj - Hamelin \n\u00a9 & (P) 2014 Disco Planet Records\n\nhttp://www.discoplanet.net\n@ Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/discoplanet\n@ Twitter: http://twitter.com/discoplanetrec\nbooking, licensing & sync inquiries:\ndiscoplanet@discoplanet.net", "title": "Bellini DJ - Hamelin", "publishedDate": "2014-06-04T10:38:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k49d76HSO4", "description": "How to buil your own fancy earrings using a little materials - For More visit: http://www.beads-projects.com - you can also visit our store: http://www.crystaldreams.es", "title": "Beads Projects - Cascade Earrings", "publishedDate": "2010-06-14T21:40:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2k4HKPJOCkE", "description": "Subscribe for new videos: http://bit.ly/1iK5Kqx\nFollow us on facebook: http://facebook.com/BoredShortsTV\nFollow us on instagram: http://instagram.com/boredshortstv\n\nNew Kid Snippets videos every MONDAY.

BEHRINGER's XM8500 has the crucial features and durability to come through for your sound again and again.\nWhat is a Dynamic Microphone?\n\nDynamic mics have several advantages that make them ideal for live vocal applications and for recording amplified instruments. They're robust, resistant to moisture and can achieve high gain before feedback. The XM8500's cardioid pickup pattern captures the source signal, such as a guitar amplifier or vocalist, while shunning off-axis sound.\nWhy the XM8500?\n\nThe XM8500 provides an amazing frequency response of 50 Hz to 15 kHz, and includes a two-stage pop filter to minimize breath and pop noises. And with its tough metal construction and sturdy steel windscreen, you can count on it to come through after countless gigs and studio applications. We've even included a rugged hard case with a mic clip and stand adapter.\n\nValue\n\nCheck out the XM8500 at your nearest BEHRINGER dealer and find out why these mics are becoming so common in practice spaces, bedrooms, professional studios and stages all over the globe. Compare them to the competition.

Two names that are two bodies. A female, the other male. An evidence that would be irrelevant if was not referring to two people, genetically different, which will meet for the first time in a space of fiction, which is always a space of desire - the stage (and, concomitantly, the dance) is this place without gender imposing a critical eye on the pulse of what attracts us, captivates, excites, or invades. On the space of \"reality\", however, the two bodies, male and female, have never had any sexual contact with the opposite sex. This is important only because in this piece - experience (not to be confused with 'experimental') aims to build a space-antipode, asking: what if... to do this: knock up all categorizations, redefine themselves all settings. In other words the historiography of sexuality that daily Joana and Bruno build in their own reality (diachrony) is here and now confronted with the story of momentary sensuality built in performance in the fictional (syncrony). Two bodies that are two names, and meet for the first time as if it were possible to counteract the genealogy to subvert the nomenclature, overcome the repulsion to embrace the mystery, dribble the preconception to know the unknown, to test the anatomical to win the psychic. And because it's a performance, we intend to explore this possibility - antipode of entertainment that reenacts the \"reality\" to serve as a last fictional escape.

comes to driving at high speeds, the bike is one of the last places in a number of vehicles that usually come to mind in this case. However, the already famous cyclist Zhissi Francois (Francois Gissy) proved for the second time the fallacy first assumption, setting the absolute world speed record on a bicycle ride with the engine. During his record run Francois accelerated to speeds of 333 kilometers per hour (207 miles per hour) in just 4.8 seconds, which he broke the record, which was set in 1985 by bike Slipstream, who was able to accelerate to 268.8 kilometers per hour.\n\nRecord check carried out on the race track Circuit Paul Ricard, which is located in the south of France. Acceleration, which developed the jet bike Francois Zhissi was so great that even the car the Ferrari 430 Scuderia, launched simultaneously with the cyclist, he looked kind of \"slow bumpkin.\"", "title": "Jet bike accelerates to 333 kilometers per hour", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T19:04:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kMcgBZU9DY", "description": "(silent - audio not for web use)\nClient: Sterling\nYear Created: 2006", "title": "Mission Employable", "publishedDate": "2010-06-03T09:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kNO7NOIZ8U", "description": "", "title": "Icacos Catamaran", "publishedDate": "2012-01-29T20:43:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kNZ6bbHunU", "description": "The Ashcroft Observatory is hosting a seminar on Pluto, the Plutoids, and the Kuiper Belt, Saturday, September 1, 2012 at 5:00 pm at the observatory.

The most common is to form a ring with the six carbon atoms.  You'll notice that there are not many hydrogen atoms in the structure.   You'll need to form alternating double bonds in order to fill the outer shells of the atoms and only use 30 valence electrons.\n\nThere are two other (probably more than that) ways to draw the Lewis structure for C6H6.  These are equally valid structures and obey the octet rule while using only 30 valence electrons.\n\nFor the C6H6 Lewis structure, calculate the total number of valence electrons for the C6H6 molecule (C6H6 has 30 valence electrons).    After determining how many valence electrons there are in C6H6, place them around the central atom to complete the octets. Be sure to use the number of available valence electrons you found earlier.", "title": "C6H6 Lewis Structure: How to Draw the Lewis Structure for C6H6 (Benzene)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T18:36:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kXgj5fIsX8", "description": "Click Here !!! http://tinyurl.com/mh67txn\n\n\nbirdhouse plans\nhouse plans\nfloor plans\nquail\nhome plans\nwild birds unlimited\nbird feeders\nhummingbird feeders\nhome design\ngarage plans\nhouse floor plans\nmealworms\nshed plans\nbird houses\npurple martin\nwoodworking projects\nhouseplans\nwoodworking plans\npergola plans\ncool house plans\nbird baths\nhouse blueprints\nfree woodworking plans\nmodern house plans\nfloor plan\nhome floor plans\ncabin plans\ndesign your own house\nhummingbird feeder\nbird bath\nlog home plans\nsquirrel proof bird feeder\nbirdhouse\nwood projects\nbirdhouses\nfarmhouse plans\nhome designs\nplayhouse plans\nsmall home plans\nfree house plans\nbird house plans\nbat house plans\ndesign homes\nluxury home plans\nbird house\nbird feeder\nhouse plan\ndesign a house\npurple martin house\ncustom home plans\nfloor plans for homes\nsimple house plans\nmansion floor plans\nbluebird house\ncraftsman home plans\nhome design ideas\nbluebird house plans\nsquirrel proof bird feeders\nbird house kits\nmodern home plans\ncottage plans\ngun cabinet plans\nfamily home plans\n5 bedroom house plans\nhow to build a birdhouse\nbuilding plans\nbluebird houses\nblueprints for houses\njewelry box plans\nmodular home plans\nbird feeder plans\nfurniture plans\nbird houses for sale\nfloor plans for houses\nbird feeder pole\nhomemade bird feeders\ncustom house plans\nwild bird center\ndream house plans\nentertainment center plans", "title": "squirrel feeder plans cedar bird house plans", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T07:17:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kXo9rt6PP4", "description": "Zach Dagle Pro Series Planer Boards from Opti Tackle featuring the Ultimate Planer Board with Working Spring Flag System right out of the package, the Ultimate Planer Board with Fixed Flag, and the Spring Flag System accessory.

Herds are not of fixed composition, with individuals joining and rejoining through the year. Female herds typically contain three to six adults, together with their calves, whereas bulls form herds of two to 18 individuals. In winter, male nilgai form herds of 30 to 100 animals in northern India.\nNilgai herds in Texas have been reported to have an average home range of 4.3 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi). Both males and females mark their territories by defecating in fixed locations on open ground, with piles building up to reach at least 3 m (9.8 ft) in diameter. They also possess scent glands on the legs and close to the feet, which they may use to scent mark their daily resting places. They are generally quiet animals, but have been reported to make short guttural grunts when alarmed, and females to make clicking noises when nursing young.\nNilgai can be seen with black buck in the open plains, and in the lower Terai regions, they may be seen with chital and hog deer. The chital and hog deer, being comparatively smaller in size, usually keep a respectful distance from the much larger nilgai. Sambar frequent hills and dense forests and are rarely found in the same habitat as nilgai.\nPredators of nilgai include tigers and leopards, although the latter are only capable of capturing calves, and not fully grown adults. Packs of feral dogs will also attack Nilgai, especially calves. Scat analysis has shown lions, although present in some parts of the nilgai's range, generally do not prey on the animals, with nilgai comprising less than 3% of their diets. Other predators include wolves and striped hyenas.\nThe nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), sometimes called nilgau, is the largest Asian antelope. It is one of the most commonly seen wild animals of central and northern India, often seen in farmland or scrub forest. The mature male appears ox-like and is also known as the blue bull. A blue bull is called a nil gai or nilgai in India, from nil meaning blue and gai meaning a bovine animal (literally 'cow'). It is also present in parts of southern Nepal and eastern Pakistan.Nilgai are habitat generalists, living in grasslands and woodlands where they eat grasses, leaves, buds, and fruit. They avoid dense forest and prefer the plains and low hills with shrubs, but may also be found in cultivated areas.\nNilgai are usually found in their favoured areas of scrub jungle (acacia forests) grazing upon succulent kader grass. They are not averse to crossing marshlands.\nSources :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai", "title": "Nilgai are living in grasslands and woodlands,Alipore Zoo,Kolkata,India", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T08:11:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kjcYAE5630", "description": "If you have lots of data in AutoCAD in tabular format but the draftsman did not used AutoCAD Table , and you need them to be exported in Excel, there are some tools available.

Many IKEA employees were threatened with termination by union officials for refusing to join the Machinists union. \nThe settlement requires union officials to return illegally seized dues to three IKEA employees and post workplace notices explaining workers' rights to refrain from union membership and paying full union dues. The union is also obligated to refund any dues unrelated to workplace bargaining collected since September 1, 2012 to employees who resign. \nIn Maine, postal worker Brett Johnson with the help of Foundation attorneys filed a federal charge against the United States Postal Service for failing to timely process his request to refrain from union membership and dues payments, thus forcing him to pay union dues for another year.\nOn April 10, 2013, Johnson sent a letter to the National Association of Letter Carriers union resigning his membership and refraining from union dues payments. He also hand-delivered the same letter to his postal service human resources representative the following day.\nAccording to the union's monopoly bargaining agreement, Johnson has a very restricted ten-day period starting on April 10th each year when he can revoke his union dues deduction authorization. \nDespite his requests, the Postal Service's human resources representative failed to forward his letter to the proper human resources department officials for processing until two months had passed. \nAs a result, the US Postal Service continues to deduct union dues from his paychecks, and he cannot ask again to stop dues payments until next year.\nJohnson has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board seeking to stop the confiscation of union dues and a refund of all union dues illegally seized from his paychecks.\nFor more information about this and National Right to Work Foundation cases, visit the Foundation's website at www.nrtw.org. \nThank you.", "title": "IKEA Machinists Union Settle, also Going Postal", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T15:59:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kotmVEsA9I", "description": "Music video by Violent Soho performing Neighbour Neighbour.", "title": "Violent Soho - Neighbour Neighbour", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T06:23:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2kowjYDgsOQ", "description": "The 2012 Dirigo Boys State Federalist Party Chair election, held in Ayotte Auditorium at Thomas College.\n\nCopyright 2012 Dirigo Boys State.

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year.  It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites,  Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years.  During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September -- 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, Nowr\u016bz was officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\n--\n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are:\n\n    * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth\n    * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence\n    * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love\n    * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine\n    * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health\n    * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise\n    * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\nOther items on the table may include:\n\n    * Sonbol - Hyacinth (plant)\n    * Sekkeh - Coins - representative of wealth\n    * traditional Iranian pastries such as baghlava, toot, naan-nokhodchi\n    * Aajeel - dried nuts, berries and raisins\n    * lit candles (enlightenment and happiness)\n    * a mirror (symbolizing cleanness and honesty)\n    * decorated eggs, sometimes one for each member of the family (fertility)\n    * a bowl of water with goldfish (life within life, and the sign of Pisces which the sun is leaving).

Puede ser dif\u00edcil de eliminar. Y la raz\u00f3n es porque est\u00e1 influenciada por tus niveles hormonales. Si tus hormonas est\u00e1n fuera de control,  entonces no importa lo que hagas, jam\u00e1s podr\u00e1s tener un abdomen plano. Pero si controlas tus niveles hormonales, la grasa abdominal podr\u00e1 comenzar a desaparecer. Entonces, \u00bfC\u00f3mo lo haces? Bueno, existen 3 cosas que tienes que saber. \nPrimero, tienes que asegurarte de dormir al menos 7 horas cada noche. Es c\u00f3mico porque cuando piensas en perder peso, piensas en que tienes que estar activo. Pero a veces, lo mejor que podemos hacer por nuestro cuerpo, es darle lo que \u00e9l m\u00e1s necesita, \u00a1Dormir! Se ha demostrado que la falta de sue\u00f1o conlleva al aumento de peso. Nos hace resistentes a la insulina, lo que hace que nuestro cuerpo entre en modo de almacenamiento. Tambi\u00e9n controla los niveles de leptina, una hormona conocida como la hormona del hambre. Entonces, si no obtenemos un buen sue\u00f1o, vamos a sentir m\u00e1s antojos de lo normal, dificultando la p\u00e9rdida de peso. \nSegundo, tienes que bajar el nivel de estr\u00e9s. El estr\u00e9s no solo nos desgasta mentalmente. Tambi\u00e9n tiene un gran efecto negativo sobre nuestros cuerpos. Nos puede llevar a sufrir del coraz\u00f3n, nos puede aumentar la presi\u00f3n arterial, y como probablemente ya lo sepas, nos puede hacer sentir como que es una meta imposible de alcanzar. Cuando tienes niveles altos de estr\u00e9s, tu cuerpo produce una hormona llamada cortisol, y esta le env\u00eda se\u00f1ales a tu cerebro para que almacene la mayor cantidad de grasa posible. As\u00ed que hasta que controles tus niveles de estr\u00e9s, se te har\u00e1 dif\u00edcil obtener un abdomen plano. El ejercicio ayuda mucho a combatir el estr\u00e9s. Siempre y cuando real\u00edces el ejercicio indicado para quemar grasa. Pero tambi\u00e9n necesitas darle a tu mente y cuerpo un momento cada d\u00eda, para relajarse por completo. Una excelente manera de hacerlo es acost\u00e1ndote, cerrando tus ojos, colocando un poco de m\u00fasica y dejando que tu mente vuele. \nFinalmente, tienes que incorporar alimentos para combatir la grasa abdominal en tu dieta diaria. Disminuir el consumo de calor\u00edas no es suficiente. Si quieres un abdomen plano, tienes que comer alimentos que impulsen tu metabolismo y equilibren tus niveles hormonales. Necesitas consumir \"s\u00faper alimentos\". Alimentos llenos de prote\u00ednas y ricos en fibra. Algunos ejemplos de alimentos para quemar la grasa abdominal son el germen de trigo, las semillas de lino o linaza, y las semillas de ch\u00eda. Bien, estos consejos para eliminar grasa abdominal, te ayudar\u00e1n much\u00edsimo, c\u00e9ntrate en ellos e implem\u00e9ntalos progresivamente en tu rutina diaria.\nejercicios para abdomen\nadelgazar abdomen\nreducir abdomen hombre\nejercicios reducir abdomen\ncomo reducir abdomen\nreducir abdomen hombres\ndieta reducir abdomen\nreducir abdominales\nreduccion abdomen\nreducir grasa abdomen\nreducir abdomen bajo\nejercicios para reducir abdomen\ndietas para reducir abdomen\nreducir abdomen\nreducir abdomen en\nreducir abdomen con\npara reducir abdomen\ncremas para reducir abdomen\nreducir abdomen y cintura\nreducir abdomen y\nreducir abdomen sin\nreducir abdomen rapidamente\naparatos para reducir abdomen\ngimnasia para reducir abdomen\ndieta para reducir abdomen\nejercicio para reducir abdomen\npara reducir abdomen y cintura\npara reducir abdomen y\nejercicios para reducir abdomen y\npara reducir grasa abdomen\nreducir grasa en el abdomen\nreducir el abdomen.", "title": "3 Trucos Para Eliminar Grasa Abdominal - Como tener un abdomen plano", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T03:39:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lCKc8tURtc", "description": "For more brilliant natural history shows, exclusive to YouTube, head over to our brand-new channel Earth Unplugged! http://www.youtube.com/earthunplugged\n\nAmazing footage of a grey kangaroo giving birth filmed by Australian filmmakers Green Cape Wildlife Films http://www.wildlifefilms.com.au/ .

Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who hired a team of futurists to devise the film's numerous technologically advanced gadgets, Minority Report co-stars Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Neal McDonough.\n\n\"minority report\",\"minority report clip\",\"minority report part 1\",\"minority report full movie\",\"tom cruise\",\"samantha morton\",\"mike binder\",\"steve harris\",\"steven spielberg\",\"ball videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"walter f parkes\",\"gerald r molen\",\"michael doven\",\"jan de bont\",\"ronald shusett\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262610,/m/08jp1f,/m/07r1h,/m/02k_c1,/m/02d42t", "title": "Minority Report (1/9) Movie CLIP - Anderton Sees Himself Kill (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T23:23:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2l_PnOQ3Ysk", "description": "Yeah Young Moola Baby \nNow it was me and lil cc and we was chillin by ourselves \n--- popped a pill and now im feelin myself \nall these cuts on my wrist, its like im killin myself \ndiamond cuts is what i mean, im so hot i might melt \nonly in your bitch mouth, nigga whatcha talkin bout \nyou aint talkin bout shit if you aint talkin bout this \ndont worry bout me, worry bout my bitch \ndont worry bout me, worry bout my bitch \n\n[chorus] \nI got a bitch named nina, and nina's so slutty \n'cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies \nsay, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies yeah \nshe'll do him and everyone of his buddies \nprotection off, safety - i look straight ahead \ni got them niggas weezy, thats what the 380 said \ni got them niggas weezy, thats what the 380 said \nthats what the 380 said, thats what the 380 said \n\nman yall aint ready, ill take one -- me and lil terry \nand we hold court like mason perry \noops, i meant perry mason, the weed got me dyslectic \nive been hungry since i in the lane, lookin for an exit \neat or get ate, and you lookin like breakfast \nyou done took it too far, now dont stretch it \ndamn, my bitch sexy \nand my bitch slutty, 'cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies yeah \nshe'll do him and everyone of his buddies \nyeah, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies \n\n[chorus]", "title": "what tha 380 said - lil wayne with lyrics", "publishedDate": "2009-04-17T20:16:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2l_QWgaBi3c", "description": "old 'billy from san antonio\nwritten by buddy parland\nthe bellyachers were buddy, hector, nathan, y jeff", "title": "the bellyachers-raised by wolves", "publishedDate": "2014-01-29T05:37:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2l_mqX7O-QU", "description": "Follow on Twitter @FlareTheFloozy\n\nD/L Mixtapes @ http://www.FLARETHEFLOOZY.com\n\nVideo shot by @stevewhitefilms\nEdited by @YoungRenz_\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SteveWhiteFilmswww.stevewhitefilms.com", "title": "Floozy - Got That Sack Freestyle (OFFICIAL VIDEO)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-11T19:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2l_ycxJ9iMw", "description": "THE LEGAL WIFE\nWeeknights on ABS-CBN Primetime Bida\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN Online channel! - http://goo.gl/TjU8ZE\nVisit our official website! \nhttp://www.abs-cbn.com ;\nhttp://www.push.com.ph\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ABSCBNnetwork\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/ABSCBN ;\nhttps://twitter.com/abscbndotcom\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/abscbnonline\n\nWatch the full episodes of The Legal Wife on TFC.TV  http://bit.ly/TLW-TFCTV\nand on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, click: http://bit.ly/TLW-IWANTV", "title": "THE LEGAL WIFE Episode: The Reversal", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T13:28:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lafLjNG40o", "description": "Isaiah Whitehead, a Top 15 player puts on a sow en route to MVP honors at the 2013 Sharette Dixon Classic!", "title": "Isaiah Whitehead!

I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making skills. \n\n\nSo, what are the basic parts of an espresso machine? What are the basic things you need to be making espresso? This is the machine here, this is sort of just standard, semi-auto espresso machine, which is what most speciality coffee shops are using. Right here is the 'portafilter'. Now this is inserted into what is called the 'group head', that is where the water actually comes down, there's a screen up in there that's basically a filter that evenly distributes the water. So in the portafilter here - what's inside it's called a 'basket', you can pop that out, and these come in many different sizes and designs. This one right here is actually a new one that's specially engineered so that there's consistency in the holes, and I've been kinda excited about it. So that just pops in and out. This is called a bottomless portafilter in that there are no spouts on it. So, technically this would extract a double espresso, a double shot, but it's just all coming out into one stream. So, portafilter in the group head, on this machine this is how you engage the water, some just have a button, but on any good espresso machine it's not gonna be automatic in that you don't just hit a button and then it goes for a certain period of time then stops. You want to have control over that so you can watch the shot, feel it out, and stop it when you think it's done. \n\n\nThis right here is just a hot water dispenser. You can use it for americanos or teas. I would recommend pulling water from a different hot water tower since this is usually not up to the right temperature, but it's great for just rinsing cups. \n\n\nThis is called the 'drip tray', that's pretty self-explanatory, water falls in there, it's plumbed underneath so it just drips down. \n\n\nThis is a steam wand. This is how you steam the milk. You can have different sorts of tips on the steam wand, as far as what kind of pressure you're putting on to the milk, but that's getting a little too in-depth. This is how you activate it, just a knob. Turn it that way - this machine's not on right now but, steam would be coming out, as well as a little bit of water. And that is pretty much the basics of an espresso machine.", "title": "Parts of an Espresso Machine | Perfect Coffee", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T17:08:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lgnn9uqQus", "description": "bird", "title": "Surf bird", "publishedDate": "2010-04-26T13:44:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lh6x7Ea_iI", "description": "Episode 13 of In Search of Giants: Dr Brian Cox takes us on a journey through the history of particle physics.

Pink Flowering Currant -   or Ribes sanguineum glutinosum.  This currant has found great favor with landscape gardeners.\n\nPink Flowering currant is a five foot deciduous shrub with long showy pink flower clusters that cover the plant in January to March. See more:   http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/plants/ribes-sanguineum-glutinosum \n\nThe genus Ribes includes the edible currants (blackcurrant, redcurrant, whitecurrant), gooseberry, and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currant used in cakes and puddings, which is a cultivar of small grape (Zante currant). It gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial Ribena. See more :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribes \n\nRibes sanguineum was introduced into cultivation by 19th century Scottish botanist David Douglas. It and its varieties and cultivars are popular garden shrubs, valued for their brightly colored and scented flowers in early spring, and birds and habitat support. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribes_sanguineum \n\nThis deciduous, multi-stemmed shrub grows 8'-10' tall on upright-arching stems. It bears deep green leaves 2\" wide, each with 3-5 lobes. The upper surfaces of the leaves are smooth, while the lower surfaces are white and finely hairy. The plants bloom in early spring (April to May), bearing 1\"-3\" long flower clusters (with 10-30 flowers per cluster) which hang down and seem to entirely cover the stems. There are both red ('King Edward VII') and white ('White Icicle') flowering cultivars available in the trade. Both hummingbirds and butterflies are attracted to the bloom. In the fall flowers give rise to blue-black fruit with whitish bloom. Songbirds readily consume the berries.  : http://www.pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=91 \n\nRibes malvaceum var. malvaceum 'Dancing Tassels' in bloom.\n\nA Selection of Currants. See more: http://www.pacifichorticulture.org/articles/a-currant-affair/ \n\nThis lovely, deciduous shrub is now starting to bloom with pendulous clusters of almost pure pink (just a touch of red). This to me is the beginning of the Garden's season of color. Yes, Manzanita's have already been doing there thing for a few weeks but in our garden's clay soils they are not as floriferous as this dependable Currant.\n\nThe Pink Flowering Currant is a very clay tolerant plant and is perhaps the most dependable and showy of all the Currant selections we have tried here at the Garden.  It is a stunning shrub in winter and spring when it is covered in bright pink flower clusters often half a foot long. Its foliage also recommends it with lobed, maple like leaves of a soft green. Hummingbirds love the flowers, and songbirds (and some people) are attracted by the blue/black fruits that develop in the summer. It grows pretty quickly and ranges in size form 5-8 feet in height with a pleasant vase or rounded shape. It may look its best  used in a woodsy landscape design along with Coffeeberry, Giant Chain Fern, and Meadow Rue. Also, if planted near pink forms of Coral Bells like 'Wendy' their colors can echo each other since their bloom times overlap. In small gardens where a tree might be too dominant, it can it can serve as a focal point.

The Royal Horticultural Society, which backed his three-year expedition, was delighted with the discovery, yet the basic flowering currant has murky pink blossom and smells of old cats. These days everyone turns their noses up at it - literally and metaphorically. The improved form, 'Pulborough Scarlet', is showy but unsubtle. For small gardens there are more exciting flowering currants. Ribes laurifolium is one of my top 50 plants. Another great plant collector, Ernest Wilson, discovered it in China in 1908. It is a small spreading shrub with matt green leaves and fat hanging bunches of green flowers whose centres are darker than their petals. It flowers very early in the year, usually by the end of January, and is one of those plants that people always notice - although in very cold winters its leaves can turn brown at the edges. The female plant sometimes bears black berries.\nRibes x gordonianum is a hybrid between the buffalo currant (R. odoratum), which has yellow flowers, and the ordinary R. sanguineum. Donald Beaton, the celebrated Victorian gardener who made the cross in 1837, named it after his employer, William Gordon.

Studies show that visualizing something going well helps make it happen. Many athletes, such as champion divers, use mental imagery to psych themselves up before a competition.\n\nStep 2: Drink juice\nDrink citrus juice before you go on stage. One study found people who downed OJ before giving a speech had lower blood pressure, fewer stress hormones, and less anxiety within just 15 minutes \u2013 and the effect lasted over 40 minutes!\n\nStep 3: Take a deep breath\nPlace your hands on top of your head or over your eyes or heart, and breathe deeply for a count of ten while visualizing a healing light coming through your hands. This Japanese exercise lowers blood pressure and decreases stress hormones.\n\nTip\nChew gum before you take the stage. It releases tension in the jaw, which, in turn, helps the entire body relax.\n\nStep 4: Imagine the audience as one person\nImagine everyone in the audience is a clone of one person: your best friend, your wife\u2014whoever is your biggest supporter. This is a favorite technique of stage-fright sufferer Shirley MacLaine.\n\nStep 5: Think of a word\nThere\u2019s a good reason meditators sit around saying, 'Om.' Research shows that focusing your thoughts on one word \u2013 any word \u2013 actually switches the brain from busy beta waves to slower, calmer alpha waves.\n\nTip\nRub your hands with a little lavender or vanilla lotion before going out on stage. These scents are so well-proven to reduce anxiety that they\u2019re used by hospitals before frightening procedures like MRIs.\n\nStep 6: Have some carbs\nForget your low-carb diet for one day and enjoy bagels, pasta, and popcorn. Carbs trigger the release of the calming chemical serotonin in the brain.\n\nStep 7: Wear a lucky charm\nMany actors and athletes wear a lucky charm to help them cope with performance anxiety. Richard Burton always wore something red when performing.\n\nStep 8: Read a poem\nRead a rhythmic poem out loud 15 minutes before showtime. Reciting poetic rhymes calms the nervous system by making you focus on something else, and the rhythmic patterns of speech help slow your breathing.\n\nDid You Know?\nLegendary actor Sir Laurence Olivier calmed down before stage performances by arriving at the theater early, scanning the audience for theater critics, and muttering insults at them.", "title": "How to Overcome Stage Fright", "publishedDate": "2009-03-04T16:09:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lwHu0eyIIc", "description": "A notification about the drug Rohypnol and its effects.

The company is a Georgia corporation formed in April 2008, and its executive offices are located at 25 McClellan Parkway, Kellyton, Alabama.\n\nE-Greens airships are a major leap in technology from traditional\u00a0lighter-than-air vehicles much in the same way helicopters added unique capabilities to fixed\u00a0wing aircraft. Advances made from 18 current patents allow E-Green to offer spherical, as well as bullet-shaped design, with vertical takeoff and\u00a0landing and five times the lift capability of conventional airships on the market today. \u00a0They hover, spin and rotate\u00a0on an axis, and no longer require wind to maintain stability. And, they are green  fueled by algae and/or diesel with later versions to run on a hybrid electric engine.\n\nE-Greens airships offer the greatest value proposition for defense, homeland security, disaster relief, remote sensing, communications, missile defense warning, surveillance and navigation, weather monitoring and other needed capabilities, combining low cost and high performance.\n\nE-Green Technology 21st Century Airships (EGT) holds the current world record for high altitude flight (22,000 ft.). E-Green plans to break this record in the next few months by bringing to market the new Bullet 580 airship, 235 feet long, 105 feet wide, 90 feet tall and 65 feet in diameter, making it the largest operating airship in the world. \u00a0The Bullet 580 has a unique design of seven internal helium envelopes that control lift while the outer envelope is completely non-rigid and contained with simple ambient air much like your everyday moon bounce found at a child's birthday party. \u00a0The algae fuel is so safe you could actually drink it, if you were so inclined.\u00a0\n\nThe first inflation of the E-Greens Bullet 580 Airship occurred at Garrett Coliseum in Montgomery, Alabama, on Monday, May 17, 2010. Test flights will begin in early summer, 2010. With these flights, the Bullet 580 will look to shatter the world record for airship flight altitude and provide a capability never before achievable by airships. Currently there exists no efficient manned or unmanned system for mid- or high- altitude and long duration flight, between 50,000-75,000 feet with the capability to stay airborne for weeks to months, providing a stable sustainable platform.", "title": "World's Largest Airship Inflated for the First Time by E Green Technologies - No Sound", "publishedDate": "2010-05-18T02:26:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2lxwDU8iUEw", "description": "Entrainement \u00e0 Ophain", "title": "Quercitron", "publishedDate": "2013-09-25T12:59:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ly1o7q6C_s", "description": "'A Bushel and a Peck' from Guys & Dolls.

In the end, two high-capacity engines (C18 ACERT) were chosen, although they have been de-rated to 873 HP so as to be able to travel continuously for over 1500 miles at a speed of 9 knots, as well as to complete rapid transfers at 18 knots.\n\nEvery detail of Dolcenera has been carefully thought-out for comfortable, reliable and flexible long-range travel.\n\nInfo:\ndolcenera.yacht@gmail.com\nhttp://www.grandbanks76.com", "title": "Yacht for Sale Grand Banks76 Aleutian - Long Range Yacht", "publishedDate": "2012-10-20T08:45:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2m2ILv3BzfE", "description": "Music video by Juan Magan performing Como El Viento.

It's a version of the well-used and worn-out trope that the Luddites were somehow against 'progress', although Hislop does hint that it is possible to question notions of 'progress' that entail great hardship.\n\nOne fundamental error is Hislop's characterisation of the Luddites as harking back to Medieval times and legislation. In fact, the legal protection afforded to many workers in the cloth industry was a product of the *early modern* period, and not the middle ages. You have to wonder about the value of such a high-profile history programme that does not understand historical periods it is referring to!\n\nThe historian Alan Brooke has described the Luddites as 'Janus-like' in that they looked back to the historic legal protection of their status and livelihood, but also forward to a different kind of world than capital and the state was offering them. The excerpt does hint at such a concept, but only slightly and in passing.\n\nHislop can't help raise a wry eyebrow at the apparent irony of his reading a Luddite oath from a tablet computer, but this is again another rolling out of the incorrect trope that the Luddites were against technology, rather than the specific machines that threatened their livelihood and the lack of say they had about how this technology was being introduced.

I'm Chris with Polar USA. Welcome to another installment in our series Polar Unique Features. Today I'm going to introduce you to the Polar SportZone feature. This feature provides an easy way to set and monitor intensity during training. It's also a great way to follow training plans found on www.polarpersonaltrainer.com. The Polar SportZones are primarily used by runners and cyclists but can be used for any cardio exercise. The SportZone training is divided into five zones and is based on individual maximum heart rate. This feature is available on select Polar products. Today were going to show you how Polar SportZone works while running. Dave is going to start his training today on the treadmill with his Polar RS300X wrist unit. Before he started training, Dave performed a Polar fitness test with the OwnIndex feature. OwnIndex provides him with his VO2 max and heart rate max values. This test will produce accurate SportZones that are set to his individual fitness level. You can find out how to perform the Polar fitness test by viewing our Polar OwnIndex video at www.youtube.com/polarusa. As Dave gets started with his training session, he warms up by running in SportZone 1. His intensity level is very low. This is also the zone during the recovery stage of the heavy interval work. Zone 1 is 50 to 60 percent of his maximum heart rate. If Dave wants to do an endurance run, his goal should be to stay in SportZone 2, which is 60 to 70 percent of heart rate max. This level is relatively light but increases metabolism and aerobic capacity. Additionally, it strengthens the body so it can tolerate high intensity training. If Dave decides he wants to push himself to the next level, he could train in SportZone 3. Running in this zone is especially effective for increasing speed endurance, which is the ability to run faster for longer. Zone 3 is between 70 and 80 percent of his heart rate max. Today Dave wants to do an interval workout to prep for an upcoming race, so he's going to train in both SportZones 4 and 5. First, he increases his speed on the treadmill. He is now working out at 80 to 90 percent of his heart rate max. This helps Dave improve high speed and anaerobic tolerance. After a four- minute interval, Dave drops down to zone 1 to recover. Once his heart rate drops down to 50 percent of his max, he decides to run a set at SportZone 5 by increasing speed and increasing the incline. This zone is 90 to 100 percent of his heart rate max, which tones the neuromuscular system and increases his explosive sprit rate speed.  After one to two minutes in the zone, Dave drops down to zone 1 again to recover. And that's how Polar SportZones work in a running training session. Thanks for taking a moment to learn about Polar's Unique Feature Polar SportZones. This feature can help take your heart rate based training to a new level of effectiveness.

The rotor consists of an inverted acrylic champagne glass with plastic bearing on the bottom. Four strips of aluminum foil are glued to the outer surface of the glass.

At clean settings, the wah gives a very deep and resonant sweep. At \"Wylde-like\" volumes coupled with other effects, the lower voicing provides for a more pleasing and soaring high end, an abundance of harmonics, and an earth shaking low end.\n\nFinishing off the pedal, Zakk himself took a sander to some wah castings to express the raw metallic finish he wanted on the pedal that would bear his name and Dunlop listened. This wah also features an adjustable torque screw in the back heel so that you can customize yourself the tension of the rocker pedal. You can loosen the tension making fast and furious \"wah-ing\" possible or you can add tension as Zakk will tend to do so that you can use the pedal as a more of tone shaper and be able to walk away from it with the pedal cracked in a certain position.\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\nFeaturing: Zakk Wylde & Bobby Cedro\nExecutive Producer: Jimmy Dunlop\nProducer/Director: Joey Tosi\nEditor/Sound: Max Baloian\nDirector of Photography: Donavan Sell\nCamera: Danny Nieder\nGaffer/2nd Camera: Matt Hazelrig\n\nSIGNAL CHAIN FOR SOUND SAMPLE:\nBobby Cedro + Gibson Les Paul + ZW45 Cry Baby + ZW44 Berzerker Overdrive + ZW38 Black Label Chorus + Marshall JCM800\n\nRecorded using Heil PR30 & PR40 microphones\nhttp://www.heilsound.com/", "title": "Zakk Wylde Signature Cry Baby", "publishedDate": "2012-04-09T17:08:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2mVvFFckL_E", "description": "", "title": "Sound of Detestation - The Storm", "publishedDate": "2010-05-21T14:10:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2mWN16jaA6c", "description": "Do not try this at home.", "title": "A.R.

This book develops a definition and a set of criteria for success in military conflict management and applies this new analytical framework in a comparative case study of the five EU military operations undertaken in Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and the Central African Republic. Having evaluated their success the book goes on to explore the conditions under which military conflict management operations conducted by international organizations are successful and explores the implications of its findings for the future theory and practice of military conflict management.\n\nThe European Union and Military Conflict Management will be of interest to students and scholars of security studies, conflict studies, European Union politics and foreign policy and global security governance.\"\n\nTo purchase the book:\nRoutledge: http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415714785/\nAmazon: http://goo.gl/Of2rDz", "title": "Annemarie Peen Rodt: The European Union and Military Conflict Management", "publishedDate": "2014-05-28T07:54:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2mbQekOZH3U", "description": "http://www.aqharacing.com\nLearn the importance of post position when handicapping American Quarter Horse races in this episode of FAQ :60.

Mubarak before him, a staunch ally of the US, stood against Iran all that time.\n\nThe rupture between Iran and Egypt came when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, recognising its right to exist. Iran held a grudge. The Iranians named a grand avenue in their capital after the man who assassinated Sadat.\n\nThat same year came the revolution in Iran, and the Islamic Republic was born as the Shah went into exile - offered hospitality by Egypt. \n\nIran is predominantly Shiite Muslim, and Egypt Sunni Muslim. Regional alliances are heavily influenced by this. For instance, Iran was the only Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member to protest when Syria was expelled.\n\nThe region, simply compared, is 80 percent Sunni and 15 percent Shiite. The orange shading here shows that the Shiites are mostly concentrated in Iran and Iraq.\n\nVast Egypt and powerful Saudi Arabia are 90 and 97 percent Sunni, respectively. But Syria and Bahrain are gripped in more complex tensions.\n\nSyria is three quarters Sunni, but the Shiite-derived Alawites, 11 percent of the population, hold the power - in the hands of President Bashar al Assad.\n\nBahrain is ruled by a Sunni king, although most of the population is Shiite, less than one third Sunni.\n\nPresident Ahmadinejad's interest in supporting Assad is not to let Syria succumb to Sunni predominance, but to maintain a so-called 'Shiite Crescent', stretching from Syria and Lebanon on the Mediterranean down through Iraq to Iran.\n\nBahrain is buckling with political tensions, and analysts suspect Tehran is actively supporting Shiite pressures being brought on the Sunni king. This has also weighed on relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies.\n\nIran is intent on maintaining and increasing its influence in the region, following the turmoil in Iraq. Sunni states hope to counter that influence. But this sort of cold war could heat up at any time. These are the high stakes of any thaw between traditional adversaries.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Islamic world Sunni/Shiite balance", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T19:08:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2mhI0DvJYEc", "description": "40 postures to stay in shape, taking care of your mind, body and energy!

The first time we did this, I told the following social story:\n\n\"My favorite book as a boy was Ralph and the Motorcycle by Beverly Cleary. Ralph is a mouse who lives in a rundown hotel.   A young boy about 9 years old, named Keith, comes to stay in the hotel.  The two becomes friends.  Keith has a toy motorcycle and Ralph learns to ride it by making motorcycle sounds with his mouth.  Keith even made Ralph a helmet out of a ping pong ball so that he would always be safe when he rode.\"\n\n\"I loved the book so much I wanted my own mouse for my birthday.  My mother, by mistake, bought a hamster instead. By the time I figured this out, it was too late and the pet store would not take the hamster back.  I was so sad I cried and cried because I wanted a mouse -- not a hamster.  To make me feel better, Mom bought me a small toy motorcycle, much like the one in the book.\"\n\n\"Well, the hamster hated that motorcycle, because I would grab him out of the cage and plop him on the seat and drive him around real fast.  My pet cat would stop and stare at us hoping I would leave the hamster alone for just a second so he could gobble him up.  The hamster couldn't stand it anymore.  He started exercising so he would get strong enough to break out of that cage.  I would see the Hamster doing sit-ups, push-ups, and stretches everyday so he could bust out.\"\n  \n\"Which he did.  And, he even took my motorcycle.\nBoys and girls this activity is about that brave hamster.\"", "title": "Hamster Dance (Elementary PE Exercise routine)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-14T22:58:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2mmTURNQSYY", "description": "Nobody by Sylvia (Live ) from 1982.

One thing that really impressed me was the vast amount of food advertisements - literally every restaurant in Seoul has tantalizing food photos on the window to lure you in!\n\nKorean barbecue is not only amazing and delicious, it's also a lot of fun as you get to cook all your meat on a grill right before you nose!\n\nThe bbq grill is made with hot coals and a griddle is placed on top. Luckily, there's a sucking fan that sucks up all the smoke so you don't get too smokey. \n\nYou basically order your cut of fresh meat, grill is right on your own table and assemble your own Korean wraps of meat that consist of lettuce leaves, garlic, chillies, chili paste, kimchi and of course the grilled meat.\n\nThis meal was eaten at the New Village Korean Barbecue restaurant (\uc0c8\ub9c8\uc744\uc2dd\ub2f9) in Seoul, South Korea. While bulgogi is normally made with beef, at New Village their signature dish is the pork bulgogi - better known as Daeji Bulgogi (\ubd88\uace0\uae30).\n\nEating Korean barbecue is a meat lovers' dream come true, truly one of the most rewarding and satisfying things you could possibly do when you visit South Korea!", "title": "Amazing Korean Barbecue in Seoul (\uc0c8\ub9c8\uc744\uc2dd\ub2f9)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-16T01:30:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2n1J5iqfkEs", "description": "Vision COPE and NPA have had too long to play in the sandbox.

Half received a placebo testosterone replacement and the other half got the real thing, but in varying four degrees of dosage intensity. \n\nThe men receiving the real hormone were subdivided into two smaller groups with some receiving a medication to block the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and the others not.\n\nMen with low estrogen levels were most afflicted, and the results shed light on where the previously testosterone-attributed problems, like fat accumulation and sexual dysfunction, were really coming from.", "title": "Why Men Need Estrogen", "publishedDate": "2013-09-17T06:07:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2n8jiAV0R1o", "description": "Orden Ogan @ Centrum Stocznia Gda\u0144ska 10.12.2010 (support przed Tiamat)", "title": "Orden Ogan @ Centrum Stocznia Gda\u0144ska 10.12.2010", "publishedDate": "2010-12-11T16:43:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2n8k_bdOe94", "description": "From the album 'In The Lonely Hour' out in the UK May 26th / U.S June 17th\nGoogle Play: http://po.st/HlYYIv \niTunes: http://po.st/FG8gsC \nAmazon: http://po.st/gB10aC \nWebstore: http://po.st/BISJto \n\nUSA\nPre-order \"In The Lonely Hour\" http://smarturl.it/SSlonelyiT\nAnd get an instant download of \"Stay With Me\" and \"Money On My Mind\"\nDebut album \"In The Lonely Hour\" available in the US June 17, 2014.\n\nGet 'Stay With Me' now on iTunes in the UK: http://po.st/ZPxsVw\nClick To Subscribe: http://bit.ly/1kXxhaZ\n\nSam Smith - Stay With Me Lyrics\n\nGuess it's true\nI'm not good \nAt a one night stand\nBut I still need love\nCos I'm just a man\nThese nights never seem to go to plan\nI don't want you to leave\nWill you hold my hand\n\nOh won't you\nStay with me\nCos you're\nAll I need\nThis aint love\nIt's clear to see\nBut darling\nStay with me\n\nWhy am I so emotional?\nNo it's not a good look\nGain some self control\nDeep down I know this never works\nBut you can lay with me\nSo it doesn't hurt\n\nOh won't you\nStay with me\nCos you're\nAll I need\nThis aint love\nIt's clear to see\nBut darling\nStay with me\n\nOh won't you\nStay with me\nCos you're\nAll I need\nThis aint love\nIt's clear to see\nBut darling\nStay with me\n\nMusic video by Sam Smith performing Stay With Me (Live on SNL).

In 405 AD Aurelius Clemens Prudentius, a successful 57-year-old Roman lawyer, two-time provincial governor, and member of the court of the emperor Theodosius I, decided to consecrated the remainder of his life to writing Christian poetry.  One of the works he compiled that year was Liber Cathemerinon (literally, \"book of daily things\" - perhaps best translated as \"Hymns for the Christian Day\"), a book of 12 long poems, each one for a particular event or time.  The last of these poems is the wide-ranging 52 stanza \"Hymn for the Epiphany\".  Eleven and a half centuries later, in 1568, five stanzas of this were used to create the hymn O sola magnarum urbium for Lauds on Epiphany.   (Lauds are the first prayers and praises at sunrise.)  In 1851 the noted English translator Edward Caswall (1814-1878) published his translation of O sola magnarum urbium as \"Bethlehem of Noblest Cities\".   \n\nThe tune, known as Stuttgart, is by Christian Friedrich Witt (1660-1716), who was well known in his day as a composer and as the compiler of one of the best hymnals of the late Baroque.\n\nEdward Caswall's English translation is:\n\n1. Bethlehem, of noblest cities\nNone can once with thee compare;\nThou alone the Lord from heaven\nDidst for us Incarnate bear.\n\n2. Fairer than the sun at morning\nWas the star that told his birth;\nTo the lands their God announcing,\nHid beneath a form of earth.\n\n3. By its lambent beauty guided,\nSee, the Eastern Kings appear;\nSee them bend, their gifts to offer,\u2014 \nGifts of incense, gold, and myrrh.\n\n4. Offerings of mystick meaning!\u2014\nIncense doth the God disclose;\nGold a Royal child proclaimeth;\nMyrrh a future tomb foreshows.\n\n5. Holy Jesu! in thy brightness\nTo the Gentile world display'd!\nWith the Father, and the Spirit,\nEndless praise to Thee be paid. \n\nThe well known Christmas hymn \"Of the Father's Love Begotten\" (Corde Natus ex Parentis) is also by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius and is from the ninth poem of Liber Cathermerinon.\n\nMore music by Martin Gaskell can be found at:\nhttp://incolor.inebraska.com/gaskell/compose.html", "title": "Bethlehem of Noblest Cities (Stuttgart)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-15T07:06:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nFu2DQilKs", "description": "Visit http://www.shinyhappyworld.com for more video tutorials and patterns designed especially for beginners.", "title": "How to Embroider with Stem Stitch", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T18:56:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nFxUUbW5nA", "description": "This animation is pretty much a flashback steve had,every night he sleeps with his toy skyblock,but this time he had a flashback or a dream if you prefer of the time he had there.\nHe dreams of his old pet pig who lost a leg during the skyblock experience (actually I lost it during animation) \nNo more spoilers for you :)\nShare with your fellow minecrafters,subscribe fo' more.\nsong:\ntake a chance- Daniel yount\nRigs by http://youtube.com/the0micahel\n\n-Abi", "title": "The love of pigs-Minecraft animation", "publishedDate": "2013-04-06T14:20:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nGCUi68TMs", "description": "", "title": "10  RETAILING", "publishedDate": "2009-02-05T19:05:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nGEqYPCSXM", "description": "This is our dog Hurly, he is a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever ...

Finding all collectibles will earn you the What's Yours is Mine trophy / achievement.\nOne collectible is obtained automatically during the prologue and cannot be missed. The rest is scattered across all main missions, client jobs and the open world (The City).\n\nTo see how many collectibles an area contains, you can open up the journal (D-Pad up), go to Player Progression and Statistics. There you'll see how many collectibles and loot items you have found in the current chapter and how many there are in total. Furthermore, there's a section called \"Collectibles\" in the journal, which lists each collectible by its name and breaks them down into categories. That makes it easier to find missing collectibles.\nAlso make sure to buy enough Rope arrows before each mission. They are often required to reach hidden areas.\n\nYou will also be shown an overview at the end of each chapter, which tells you how many items you have recovered. You can then replay the chapter immediately if you missed something. You can also replay chapters at any given time by returning to their starting point in the open world.\n\nThief Collectible Guide Playlist:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRr5L69yg_kF5k7gkvLJoJ_BzrvmQQ3Cn\n\nStarting Points of Chapters & Client Jobs:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com/guide/thief-all-starting-points-of-chapters-and-client-jobs.html\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n#1 - The Pinned Castinets: Mourning Bell - 0:05\n#2 - The Court of Montonessi: Compassion, Foul - 1:24\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFollow Me:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx\n\nContact Me:\nmail@powerpyx.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", "title": "Thief - All Collectible Locations - Chapter 8: Dawn's Light (What's Yours is Mine Trophy Guide)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T22:48:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nKuoNhihh4", "description": "Kinda speaks for itself.

Yet now our Darwin-lobbying friends have serious egg on their faces after making (not their first) unwise choice of associates. The group invited climate activist Peter H. Gleick of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security, an ideological compatriot and neighbor in Oakland, CA, to join its board. Bad move. Gleick has just suffered a major ethical embarrassment, leading to a break with the NCSE and leaving the Darwin enforcers under a cloud. http://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/02/national_center056591.html\nListenGenesis 7:11 \"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\" \n\nThe year of 1816 was called the \"year without a summer.\" Weather records and newspaper clippings offer us a record of the unusual weather that struck all over the Earth in 1816.\n\nA Vermont newspaper reported that on June 6 it began to snow and hail at 10:00 in the morning and continued until evening. In mid-July the corn crop in Maine was almost completely destroyed by frost. In late August the remaining corn crop, as far south as Massachusetts, was frozen out along with other crops.\n\nThis bizarre story actually begins a year before, in 1816, in Indonesia. That's when Mt. Tambora began to erupt with such violence that some of the explosions could be heard 1,000 miles away. In the end, Tambora had blown over 25 cubic miles of debris into the atmosphere. This dust blocked enough of the sun's light to virtually cancel the following summer all over the Earth.\n\nHowever, the lesson for us is that huge, Earth-changing catastrophes are a normal part of our planet's history. It might take normal processes 500 years to create a layer of sediment six inches thick. However, a flood, volcanic eruption or hurricane can create the same layer in only a few hours. Just think how far off evolutionary dating is when this happens. We know from experience that things don't just continue for thousands of years without some catastrophe taking place.\n\nPrayer: \nFather in heaven, the violence and power of an earthquake or volcanic eruption reminds us how helpless we truly are. Increase my conviction that my life always rests in Your loving hands so that the violence of nature does not have to remind me. In Jesus' Name. Amen.\n\nNotes: \nStommel, Henry, and Elizabeth Stommel. 1980. \"The year without a summer.\" Scientific American, Dec. p. 176.", "title": "Global Cooling, Global Warming  or Global Dumbness", "publishedDate": "2012-01-24T11:36:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nOxFszH6uQ", "description": "", "title": "Cobweb Vymetenci", "publishedDate": "2010-05-23T12:22:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "2nP3T4U8QJc", "description": "Black lady pulls off her wig for bidding the right price.

Como norma general, aunque no es totalmente condicional :), los cuadros de larga longitud ser\u00e1n los m\u00e1s adecuados para riders altos.\n\nOtra medida a tener en cuenta, es la altura de la caja de pedales. Cuanto m\u00e1s cerca del suelo est\u00e9 la caja de pedales, menos nerviosa y m\u00e1s estable, a la hora de montar, ser\u00e1 la bicicleta.\nOtra medida muy importante a tener en cuenta es la longitud de las vainas. Esta longitud se obtiene de medir desde el buje trasero hasta la caja de pedales y su longitud condiciona la dificultad o facilidad de realizar determinadas t\u00e9cnicas-posiciones sobre la bicicleta de trial.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, dos medidas a tener muy en cuenta son las medidas de nuestra potencia y manillar\n \nEsperamos que os haya sido \u00fatil ^_^.
