Het wapiti is op de eland na de grootste hertensoort. De naam wapiti betekent witte achterzijde en is afkomstig van de Shawnee-Indianen\n\nVisitors to the park can meet elk practically everywhere. \n'Wapiti' is the Indian name for these deer. It means 'lightly coloured or white deer'. A hundred years ago, elk were the most common mammal in the Rockies.\nLooking for deer?

Tan duro como pueda parecer, la Vaginosis Bacteriana es completamente curable.\nVoy a compartir con usted las f\u00f3rmulas que yo us\u00e9 para curar mi VB en un per\u00edodo corto de tiempo sin usar las medicinas o cualquier otro producto sin\norden m\u00e9dica que nunca funcionaron.\nTodos los m\u00e9todos y tips cubiertos en \"Alto Vaginosis Bacteriana\" son 100% seguros y efectivos. Yo los he usado, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n otras mujeres y creo\nque usted tambi\u00e9n puede.\nLa primera vez que experiment\u00e9 una descarga vaginal olorosa no tuve idea de qu\u00e9 ten\u00eda malo en m\u00ed. Mi esposo estuvo de vuelta de un viaje una semana antes, y yo estaba segura de que me hab\u00eda enga\u00f1ado e infectado. Estaba tan rota como para confrontarle que le forc\u00e9 para ir a traer una prueba sin decirle lo que estaba sucediendo. Imagine mi sorpresa cuando sus resultados salieron limpios!\nEsa noche yo decid\u00ed que lo sorprender\u00eda por la noche. Todo estaba yendo bien, hasta que se detuvo en medio de una charla y pregunt\u00f3 \"\u00bfCari\u00f1o, hueles algo raro?\" eso fue todo, desde ese momento en adelante estaba siempre inc\u00f3moda frente a \u00e9l, hasta que cur\u00e9 completamente la Vaginosis bacteriana (VB). Hoy nosotros s\u00f3lo bromeamos sobre la VB (Vaginosis Bacteriana), especialmente cuando yo preparo un plato de pescado.\nYo prob\u00e9 curar la VB usando cada m\u00e9todo sobre el cu\u00e1l pude poner mis manos y ninguno funcion\u00f3, hasta que aterric\u00e9 en una f\u00f3rmula que hace milagros. Mientras usted lee esto yo he estado libre de la VB desde que us\u00e9 la f\u00f3rmula.\nS\u00e9 que usted est\u00e1 pasando por un problema similar y yo garantizo una v\u00eda que la librar\u00e1 completamente de la Vaginosis Bacteriana y mejor todav\u00eda, 24 horas despu\u00e9s de que usted aprenda el m\u00e9todo, no tendr\u00e1 el olor sospechoso de nuevo.\nLo Que El M\u00e9dico Nunca Le Dice\nLea Esto Antes Que Tome Su Pr\u00f3xima Dosis\n.\nCada vez que visita a su m\u00e9dico, ellos nunca le dicen la verdad sobre c\u00f3mo los antibi\u00f3ticos funcionan.\nLe dar\u00e1n antibi\u00f3ticos para su VB, pero nunca le dir\u00e1n que los antibi\u00f3ticos matar\u00e1n ambas bacterias, las buenas y las malas.\nCuando las bacterias buenas son retiradas de su cuerpo, se queda sin las bacterias \u00fatiles para ayudarle a combatir contra las bacterias infecciosas.\nLa p\u00e9rdida de estas bacterias buenas tambi\u00e9n pavimenta el camino para el crecimiento de la Candida Albicans (infecciones por hongos) por lo tanto, la pregunta es... \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 desear\u00eda querer curar la VB y tener que comenzar luego con el tratamiento para la infecci\u00f3n por hongos?\nUsando \"Alto Vaginosis Bacteriana\", aprender\u00e1 c\u00f3mo librarse s\u00f3lo de las bacterias da\u00f1inas que causan la VB mientras que multiplica las bacterias \u00fatiles. Esto curar\u00e1 su VB mientras que mantiene la infecci\u00f3n por hongos y otras infecciones a raya.\n\u00bfCu\u00e1l Fue el resultado Final de A\u00f1os de Investigaci\u00f3n\nIntensiva y de Testeos?\nDespu\u00e9s de dejar de lado los tratamientos convencionales, me embarcaba en un viaje de investigaci\u00f3n y comprobaci\u00f3n. Para encontrar la cura correcta tuve que buscar la asistencia de los especialistas en nutrici\u00f3n, herbolarios, y microbi\u00f3logos.\nEl resultado final fue un asombroso \"Alto Vaginosis Bacteriana\" respaldado por los resultados exitosos que obtuve, siendo el primer conejillo de indias.\nTengo el gusto en presentarle m\u00e9todos que curaron completamente mi Vaginosis Bacteriana y han ayudado a cientos de otras mujeres a librarse de la Vaginosis bacteriana.", "title": "Como Eliminar La Vaginosis Bacteriana o Mal Olor Vaginal Naturalmente En La Comodidad de Su Hogar", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T01:19:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hWQOvxxvaY", "description": "WATCH MXoN LIVE on http://www.mxgp-tv.com\n\n\nFOLLOW MXGP\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/mxgp\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/mxgp\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/mxgp\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/mxgptv\n\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.mxgp.com", "title": "MXGP of Leon 2014 GoPro Cairoli, Philippaerts, Guarneri - Motocross", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T03:57:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hWSOt1xW-w", "description": "Les gens de Bouze - chant traditionnel Bourguignon - Chorale A travers Chants Dijon", "title": "Les gens de Bouze - Traditionnel Bourguignon", "publishedDate": "2009-07-01T23:35:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hWTnSf6cW8", "description": "TheSoundYouNeed - Music at its finest\nll Facebook : http://on.fb.me/12s8hhw\nll Soundcloud : http://bit.ly/Ud6RVg\nll Tumblr : http://bit.ly/Ws6low\n\nAnother outstanding garage/house track from Bear//Face, the 19 year old producer from UK, Belfast.\n\nFor copyright issues, mail us here : tsyn.thesoundyouneed@gmail.com\n\n\u261e Follow Bear//Face\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helloyesthis...\nhttp://soundcloud.com/helloyesthisisb...\n\n\u261e Buy on BandCamp\nhttp://helloyesthisisbearface.bandcam...\n\n\u2716 Picture\nhttp://www.fran-dominguez.com/", "title": "Bear//Face - Taste My Sad", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01T14:45:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hWY5erBhgM", "description": "\u00a1Pink Floyd saca disco nuevo despu\u00e9s de 20 an\u0303os\u00a1\n\n6 de Julio 2014\n\nPara m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n entra: http://www.youtube.com/excelsiortv\n\n\nNo olvides dejarnos tus comentarios y visitarnos en\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ExcelsiorMex\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Excelsior_Mex\nSitio: http://www.excelsior.com.mx/tv", "title": "\u00a1Pink Floyd saca disco nuevo despu\u00e9s de 20 an\u0303os\u00a1 / M\u00fasica con Alexis Castro", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T20:25:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hWZ40120BQ", "description": "Cutaway of a 7 cylinder Radial engine at the San Diego Air and Space Museum.", "title": "How a Radial Engine Works", "publishedDate": "2007-01-01T04:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hXRH9xq2nU", "description": "The Model 2002Y 3-Phase Voltage Unbalance Monitor is designed to continuously monitor a three-phase line with a neutral connection for unbalanced voltage conditions. \n\nThis device will only energize the relay if an unbalance exists.

About 60 - 80% of the adult \n\nsuffer from lower back pain. \n\nBack pain is felt when you have a mis alignment  in your spine, when an organ and its surrounding\n\n tissue are in lesion , when there is inflammation in the area, when pressure is placed on the\n\n nerves and discs of the spine, with muscle spasms, and  degenerative changes in the spine.  \n\nHow Osteopath's help relieve back pain?\n\nThrough Assessment\n-finding the root cause \n-treatment \n-exercise prescription \n-Lifestyle Modifications - Nutrition, Sleep, hydration, stress reduction \n\nCradle\n\nOne of the common back pain treatment techniques is called \"The Cradle technique\". This technique is used when rigidity or \"Stiffness\" is assessed in the joints that attach to the ribs to the spine.  For example you may be feeling a nagging pain in their upper back that you can not relieve with a change in your position or you may experience pain in the mid back with breathing..... When your therapist uses a rocking motion with the cradle technique the therapist will feel the rigided areas with their hand placed either at the rib angle or beside the vertebra of the spine and an impulse is given to free the blocked area \n \n\nSacrum \n\nThe next technique a Sacrum technique. This technique is used when the sacrum is rigid \"Locked\" with the pelvis. some of the symptoms you might be feeling are \n-your back hurts when you sit down or when you go from a sitting position to standing position\n- you are unable to stand upright instead you hunched over\n-you may feel discomfort in your back near where your belt line is. \n-or you may feel like your hip's locked \n\nThere are number of techniques for the sacrum that can be used to release the sacrum, your therapist will assess what treatment is needed.  \n\n\n\nPPP\n\nThis technique is a re- centering of the Mesentary. The mesentery is a bag like structure that surrounds the small intestines and when tense creates tension in the lower back. Some of the symptoms you might be feeling are \n\n- Constipation \n-Gas\n-Bloating \n-Water retention \n- or general lower back pain \n\nThis re- centering of the mesentery helps to remove the strain in the mesentery and reduces the tension in the lower back. \n\n\nDiaphragm \n\nThe diaphragm technique is a technique used to treat the thoracic diaphragm.  The diaphragm is a large and powerful muscle that separates the heart and lunges from the organs of digestion.  \n\nThe diaphragm aids you in breathing and can become tight from a trauma, or from colds, flus and stress.  It has attachements into the lower six ribs and also into the front part of the lower back vertebra.  When unbalanced the diaphragm can create tension, dysfunction and pain in the mid and lower back. \n\n\nIf you have back pain and would like treatment e-mail me at Carolyn.ust@gmail.com\n\nMake sure you subscribe to my YouTube Channel here for more Therapist Thursday Tips\n\n\nPlease comment below, share with your friends and let Carolyn know what you think\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/carolynzepf\nhttp://www.facebook.com/carolynzepf\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynzepf\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteopath Back Pain Relief with Carolyn Zepf on Therapist Thursday", "title": "Osteopath Back Pain Relief with Carolyn Zepf on Therapist Thursday", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T17:32:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hrjxIB48Ck", "description": "AJMVs summed up in one video\n\nSong: IceJJfish - On The Floor\none of my laziest videos I have made in awhile\nand yes, it is meant to be poorly made", "title": "GENERIC ANIMAL JAM MUSIC VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2014-05-25T00:41:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4hrpshSzHKw", "description": "DJ Yoda playing at Soundwave festival Croatia (20.7.2012)", "title": "DJ Yoda live @ Soundwave festival Croatia", "publishedDate": "2012-07-26T19:22:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ht-AM9Fi0I", "description": "Regent Street and Oxford Street are among the grandest and most famous shopping avenues in the world.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative pathogen that is emerging as a predominant cause of infections within military personnel injured during Operation Iraqi Freedom and has recently caused deadly outbreaks in the U.S., South America, and Europe. In addition to causing high incidences of morbidity and mortality, both organisms have also developed resistance to all currently available antibiotics, further amplifying public health concern and accentuating the need for new antibiotics for the treatment of S. aureus and A. baumannii infections.\n\nOur laboratory uses S. aureus and A. baumannii as model organisms to study bacterial pathogenesis and develop novel strategies for the therapeutic intervention of bacterial infections. That work has revealed that most bacterial virulence factors are post-transcriptionally regulated in a manner that involves the modulation of their mRNA turnover. Current laboratory projects are geared toward characterizing the molecular components that govern 'native' and temporal changes in mRNA degradation. These factors can be broadly categorized as either: small non-coding RNAs, ribonucleases, or RNA binding proteins. We have purified and exploited several of these factors as targets for antimicrobial drug discovery.", "title": "Dunman Lab Drug Discovery at the University of Rochester", "publishedDate": "2013-04-25T15:26:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4i7KYMXjMMY", "description": "TV Advert", "title": "Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T01:29:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4i7RGuhm87U", "description": "Bring one foot forward and slide the hip forward, back and forward.

She had corrupted her life and all of this was really Demi's fault. All Demi's fault. \"You're a horrible person,\" Her mind screamed at her to as she made her way upstairs, \"All Selena ever did was be a good friend. And you've betrayed her.\" Demi burst into her room, her eyes swimming with tears. \n\nSo it was settled. Demi would no longer hurt her bestfriend. But she know Mr. Gomez wouldn't let her off the hook that easily. She was his accomplice. And Demi knew if she helped Selena sink her father, she'd be dragged down by the neck too. But oddly, Demi didn't care. She knew she deserved what was coming to her. \n\n-\n\nHe didn't know what to be hurt by the most; the fact that his brother was hiding in his girlfriend's closet, or the fact that Selena wishes she never had met them. Joe watched Selena cry and his heart broke. He hated seeing Selena cry. He hated seeing Selena cry because of him. \"...sometimes I wish I never met you guys...\" Her words ran through Joe's mind. He suddenly felt very angry. At one person and only one person; Nick. Joe and Selena were perfectly fine before he became emotionally involved. \n\nJoe lunged for Nick and before Selena knew it, they were both on the floor, throwing punches at each other. Selena shrieked, no longer caring that her father would hear her. \"Get off of him!\" Selena screamed, and tried to pry Nick off of Joe. All with no avail. Finally, not knowing what else to do, Selena grabbed her glass lamp with shaky hands. Fearing Nick would kill Joe, Selena broke the lamp on his back, \"Get off of him!\" She shrieked. Nick groaned and he toppled off of him. Selena helped Joe up, restraining him from going after Nick. \n\nThere were footsteps in the hallway and Selena knew she had woken up her parents. \"I didn't here anything, dear, let's go back to bed!\" Selena heard her mother trying to coax Mr. Gomez away from her bedroom. \"Nonsense, there's somebody in there!\" Selena's eyes widened and she practically dragged the brothers to the balcony. \"Out! Both of you. Get out!\" She hissed. \"And don't you dare come back!\" She said to them as they climbed down. \n\nThe door swung open and in the door frame stood the large Mr. Gomez and behind him, the thin Mrs. Gomez. \"See darling,\" she said hastily, \"Nobody but Selena.\" Mr. Gomez looked doubtful, \"I could have sworn I heard someone in here. Say, what the hell happened in here?\" He inquired,  eyeing the pieces of glass scattered upon the white carpet. Selena pursed her lips, \"I was trying to see if I could make it to the bathroom without turning the lights on, but my foot caught the lamp cord and it kind of fell to the ground and shattered.\" Mr. Gomez narrowed his eyes into slits. \"Are you lying to me girl?\" Selena shook her head, \"No daddy,\" she said. \"I'll send Matil to clean this up --\" \n\n\"I can handle it,\" Selena assured her father. He gave her another reluctant look before closing the door and walking back to his bedroom with Mrs. Gomez whispering, \"I told you!\" \n\nSelena sighed. She slid down the wall and buried her face into her knees. Could her life possibly get any worse?", "title": "Take My Hand ~ Seventy Eight", "publishedDate": "2013-01-27T11:34:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4iFTcIynBJs", "description": "Edo Minato Fourth Hokage Complete Moveset with Command List.

Dieser Eigenheit verdankt diese Heilpflanze ihren Gattungsnamen Umbilicus, dies bedeutet im lateinischen Nabel. Das Nabelkraut erreicht eine Wuchsh\u00f6he zwischen 20 und 50 cm Die nur wenig bebl\u00e4tterten St\u00e4ngel sind fast \u00fcber ihre gesamte L\u00e4nge mit kleinen, gr\u00fcnlichen bis gelblichwei\u00df gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fcten bewachsen.\n\nDie Bl\u00fctenknospen stehen bis zum Aufbl\u00fchen waagrecht vom St\u00e4ngel ab, nach dem \u00d6ffnen neigen sie sich zum Boden.

Administration is when everything goes right. We marshall the decedent's assets, we give them to the beneficiaries that is suppose to receive them. \n\n00:14 Litigation is when something or everything goes wrong. Assets are going where they shouldn't go or not going to where they should go.  That's what litigation is about. It is important that you have a Probate Attorney. Probate has it's own special set of rules. So, if you are an attorney that does not generally practice in probate, you won't know those rules  and you can make mistakes that are catastrophic to an estate. \n\n00:34 That's the reason that I limit my practice to Probate, Guardianship and Personal Injury, an advantage I have over most transactional attorneys. Probate administration is mostly a transactional practice is that I have actually been to trial. \n\n00:48 Most probate attorneys don't have that experience.  They've done the administration, but not the litigation and I have done the litigation, I have gotten the verdicts.  \n\n00:56 One of the things that I try to remember is when I meet a new client is that this is an extremely traumatic time in their life.

You'll conclude with metabolic core conditioning and a well earned stretch. Varied step heights and hand weight selections are used to enhance intensity.

Having been built under a hill, it also served as a bomb-shelter for Filipino and American troops.  Inside, we could still see the remains of the tunnel, parts of which have already caved in due to intense bombing by the Japanese.\n\nOther interesting sights included the lighthouse built on the rock in 1836.  Since then it's undergone many replacements and rebuilding after damages brought on both by time and by the war.\n\nThe heavy artillery was still there - a reminder of exactly how serious the fight that took place there was.\n\nCorregidor is not just a tourist hotspot, it is also a memorial for the courage, valor and heroism of Filipino and American soldiers who bravely held their ground against the Japanese forces during World War II.", "title": "Corregidor Island, Philippines", "publishedDate": "2012-02-07T22:13:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4iOvpcjgMDQ", "description": "June 9, 2014.

In the past year we've gone sea kayaking in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam and around Kimitoon Island in Finland.  When we noticed kayaking was a popular activity for those based nearby the Whitsunday Islands, we were thrilled to try it again for the third time.  You'd almost think at this point we're kind of becoming experts at it ;)  Blessed with gorgeous weather we really got to appreciate just how stunningly beautiful this part of Queensland, Australia really is when witnessed with your own two eyes.  The following is our kayaking day adventure with Salty Dog.\n\nIt is amazing the kinds of new hobbies you can pick up while on the road.\n\nOver the last year we've had the opportunity to try kayaking in both Vietnam and Finland.\n\nWhen the opportunity came to try it in the Whitsundays with Salty Dog we jumped at the chance.\n\nAt times it was hard to concentrate on paddling given the spectacular scenery of the Whitsunday Islands.\n\nDuring the outing we also got to spend a bit of time relaxing on an island with a pristine beach.\n\nOverall, we'd recommend sea kayaking to just about anyone given that it is a safe and fun activity.\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Australia series.

Afecta a alrededor del 40 % de las personas en alg\u00fan momento de sus vidas. El dolor lumbar puede ser clasificada por la duraci\u00f3n tan aguda, subcr\u00f3nica o cr\u00f3nica. La condici\u00f3n puede ser clasificada por la causa subyacente , ya sea mec\u00e1nica no mec\u00e1nica , o dolor, se hace referencia .\nEn la mayor\u00eda de los episodios de dolor de espalda bajo , una causa subyacente espec\u00edfica no se identifica o incluso busc\u00f3 , con el dolor que se cree que es debido a problemas mec\u00e1nicos tales como el m\u00fasculo o la tensi\u00f3n conjunta . Si el dolor no desaparece con el tratamiento conservador o si se acompa\u00f1a de \"banderas rojas\" , como la p\u00e9rdida de peso inexplicable , fiebre o problemas significativos con la sensibilidad o del movimiento , puede ser necesario realizar pruebas adicionales para buscar un problema subyacente grave. En la mayor\u00eda de casos , herramientas de imagen , como la tomograf\u00eda de rayos X computarizada no son \u00fatiles y llevan sus propios riesgos. A pesar de esto , el uso de im\u00e1genes en el dolor de espalda baja se ha incrementado. Un poco de dolor de espalda baja es causada por los discos intervertebrales da\u00f1ados , y el test de elevaci\u00f3n de pierna recta es \u00fatil para identificar a esta causa. En las personas con dolor cr\u00f3nico , el sistema de procesamiento del dolor puede funcionar incorrectamente, provocando una gran cantidad de dolor en respuesta a acontecimientos no graves .\nEl tratamiento del dolor lumbar inespec\u00edfico agudo es normalmente con medidas conservadoras como el uso de medicamentos para el dolor simples y la continuaci\u00f3n de tanta actividad normal mientras el dolor lo permita. Los medicamentos se recomiendan para la duraci\u00f3n de que sean \u00fatiles , con acetaminofeno (tambi\u00e9n conocido como paracetamol) como el primer medicamento preferido. Los s\u00edntomas del dolor de espalda por lo general mejoran en pocas semanas desde el momento en que comienzan , con 40-90 % de las personas completamente mejores por seis semanas.\nUn n\u00famero de otras opciones est\u00e1n disponibles para aquellos que no mejora con el tratamiento habitual. Los opi\u00e1ceos pueden ser \u00fatiles si los analg\u00e9sicos simples no son suficientes, pero generalmente no se recomiendan debido a los efectos secundarios. La cirug\u00eda puede ser beneficiosa para aquellos con dolor cr\u00f3nico relacionados con los discos y la discapacidad . Tambi\u00e9n puede ser \u00fatil para aquellos con estenosis espinal . No existe un beneficio claro se ha encontrado otros casos de dolor lumbar no espec\u00edfico. El dolor lumbar a menudo afecta el estado de \u00e1nimo , que se puede mejorar mediante el asesoramiento y / o los antidepresivos.

This video recipe shows each step of the process & helpful tips.\n\nPreparation Time: 30 mins\nCooking Time: 10 mins\nServes: 8\n\nIngredients:\n4 Msa Australian Beef Rump Steaks, trimmed and halved horizontally \n2 tablespoons Woolworths Select Australian extra virgin olive oil\nFreshly ground Woolworths Select sea salt\nFreshly ground Woolworths Select black pepper\nGreen pistou\n2 tablespoons Woolworths Select Dijon mustard\n2 tablespoons Woolworths Select red wine vinegar\n1 tablespoon water\n\u00bd cup Woolworths Select Australian extra virgin olive oil \n2 fresh garlic cloves, crushed\n6 anchovy fillets, finely chopped\n2 tablespoons drained baby capers in wine vinegar \n1 cup each fresh continental parsley leaves, basil leaves & mint leaves, finely chopped\n\nMethod\n1. Green pistou:  Whisk mustard, vinegar, water and oil together until well combined. Add garlic, anchovies, capers and herbs, season.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. \n2. Preheat a barbecue plate or char-grill pan  on medium-high. Drizzle both sides of the steaks with oil and season well with salt and pepper. Char-grill steaks, in batches, for 2 minutes each side for medium. Transfer to a tray, cover loosely with foil while cooking remaining steaks.\n3. Place steaks onto a large serving platter. Serve with Green Pistou.\n\nTip 1:  Green Pistou can be made without adding the herbs up to 12 hours in advance. Stir herbs into sauce, just before serving.\nTip 2: Always rest meat before serving as this relaxes the meat and ensures the juices stay within the meat when carved.\nTip 3: You can use different types of soft fresh herbs when making green pistou.\n\nDiscover other delicious recipe videos by clicking the videos in the below Easy BBQ Recipes:\n\nBBQ'd Haloumi Skewers w/ Pistachio Dukkah & Watermelon - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC4ue4gyb9w\n\nBBQ Salmon Side w/ Sicilian Salsa & Lemony Cabbage Slaw  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHFEELtcnqA\n\nMacerated Nectarine & Mango Tartlets  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtZMZ6yuFRs\n\nChar-Grilled Sweet Potato w/ Coriander Vinaigrette - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRdj_K9o-6E\n\nChar-Grilled Rump Steaks w/ Green Pistou - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j1o5MgYRR8\n\nCheck out more recipes on the website - http://woolworthschristmas.com.au/\n\nFollow us on conversation on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/woolworths", "title": "Char-Grilled Rump Steak Recipe w/ Green Pistou", "publishedDate": "2013-12-03T00:42:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4j1qS2C8b7E", "description": "www.twitch.tv/dubastv\nwww.twitch.tv/immunepwnz", "title": "Dubas, Immune - \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u044f", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T12:53:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4j2CXg5MZrE", "description": "Prod by Lethal Track\nGuantanamera Bricks Mixtape by Mercenaire TMG\nBooking : thugmusicbricks@gmail.com", "title": "Mercenaire _ Epi Mwen (Official Video) TMG Shot by @RealEyzProd", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T19:03:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4j2L26mNyl0", "description": "Deliver Us from Evil Soundtrack - \"The Truth Seeker\" By Christopher Young \n\nMore good music on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXF-HZBzv3hyoR8CAZLE48A", "title": "Deliver Us from Evil OST - The Truth Seeker - Christopher Young", "publishedDate": "2014-08-14T13:56:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4j2i0tAwanQ", "description": "Is that a sting on this caterpillar's tail, or is it just pretending to be a leaf--with a long stem?\n\nI have been stung by caterpillars, before, and one type hurts almost as much as a bee.

They also claim that a Warner Bros. owned production company ignored their concerns, when they were expressed.\n\nBut Jackson and other producers of the film made a statement saying that extraordinary measures were taken to provide good care of animals on set and that allegations of animal mistreatment off set have only recently been brought to the producers attention, saying, \"The producers completely reject the accusations that twenty seven animals died due to mistreatment during the making of the films.\"\n\nSo were the animals hurt or not? Jackson said producers are currently investigating the claims and are attempting to speak with the parties involved. And a spokesperson did tell the Associated Press that no animals were hurt during filming, but also mentioned that what happens off-set remains a blind spot. \n\nWill PETA boycott \"The Hobbit\" when it opens in theaters on December 14th?

Always let the girl know you want to talk to her before you even talk to her. Don't make the mistake of approaching a girl out of the blue and asking her out. It almost always never works, unless you're a smooth talker with the gift of gab. \nIf you're a regular joe who wants to turn into a chick magnet, just follow these steps and you'll win her attention before you finish your drink! Learn more about how to approach a girl, please visit: https://bit.ly/WlWBGL\n\nHow to Approach a Girl - How to start talking to the girl\nNow that you've built the attraction and the chemistry, all you need to do is walk up to her and say something. Use these tips to approach her and start the right conversation.\n#1 How to Approach a Girl - Waiting for the moment. Sometimes, all you need to do is wait for the girl to give you a chance to talk to her. If she's really interested in you and wants to talk to you, she'd create enough opportunities for you to walk up to her. She could do this by walking to the ladies room alone, stepping away from her friends by answering a phone call, or even by just smiling at you and leaving the place.\nIt's always easier to talk to a girl when she's by herself. There are no distractions from her friends or awkward moments because she's already expecting you to approach her.\n#2 How to Approach a Girl - Picking her up from afar. Gesticulate. Use the right gestures to get her attention. This is tricky, but as long as you get the message across, it'll still work as long as you do it confidently.\nLook straight at her, and smile. Jerk your neck sideways just a little bit after you lock your eyes with her, and using your eyes, point her to the bar counter or some exit. Even if she doesn't get it, you can walk up to the place you were pointing at by yourself, and she'll know what you mean.\nNot all girls may appreciate you gesticulating at her and asking her to walk up to you, but if you've built the chemistry from afar, she'd be more than happy to get away from her friends and give you a chance to talk to her\n#3 How to Approach a Girl - The group of girls. Walk up to her with your gaze fixed on her confidently. Walk right into the herd, but look straight at her and only her. Look at anyone else, and the envious friends would pounce on you with snide remarks because you didn't pick them to flirt with.\n\"Hey... I really don't mean to interrupt you girls, but could I speak with you for a minute? I just won't be able to forgive myself if I left this place without getting to know you...\"\nUse any line you want and it'll work as long as you say it firmly, but remember to make her feel special by saying something that reveals how badly you want to get to know her. And unless her friends seem to take your side by nudging her towards you or by smiling widely, completely avoid looking at them. You'd only be asking for trouble. \n#4 How to Approach a Girl - Buy her a drink. This is something that can work very well at a bar, as long as you've already built the eye staring up and roused her interest. Buy her the same drink she's already having, and ask the waiter to offer it to her. The waiter will probably drop a corny and grand message like \"the gentleman sitting over there would like to offer you this drink...\"\nWhen she accepts the drink and looks towards you smiling, that's your cue. Don't wait any longer or she'll think you're a coward. But if you buy her a drink without building the connection first, you'll just come off as a creepy guy. \n#5 How to Approach a Girl - A twosome. If there are just two girls, walk right up to them while staring at the girl you like. If the girl's interested in you too, her friend will slip away quietly with an excuse. But even if the friend decides to stay, just introduce yourself and say something similar to the line used in #3. But this time, include the girl's friend in your conversation and make her feel good about herself too. But don't forget to keep the focus on the girl you like!\nKeep these conversation moves in mind and it'll definitely do you good. But if you want to make sure it works all the time, build the tension and the mystery first with your glances and your eye contact. You'll always end up impressing the girl even before you approach her.\nUse these tips on how to approach a girl you don't know and with a few attempts, you'll have no trouble walking up to any girl you like and impressing her within minutes of making eye contact with her!\nLearn more about how to approach a girl, please visit: https://bit.ly/WlWBGL", "title": "How to approach a girl - When to Approach a woman.

The result of billions of dollars of research and featuring components borrowed from some of the world's leading laboratories, THE INCREDIBLE BIONIC MAN shows how far we've come in efforts to simulate the human body. A new one-hour documentary about the ambitious project premieres on Smithsonian Channel on Sunday, October 20, 2013 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. \n\nSmithsonian Channel is bringing the Bionic Man to the United States to go on public display, unveiling it at New York Comic Con October 10-13 and subsequently at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. through the fall. \n\nTHE INCREDIBLE BIONIC MAN begins with a team of engineers led by Richard Walker and Matthew Godden from Shadow Robot Company, gathered in a London warehouse, surrounded by boxes and crates from around the world. Inside are 28 of the most advanced artificial body parts ever made. The engineers' task \u2014 to put them together and create a Bionic Man that walks, talks, grasps, sees, hears and even thinks \u2014has never been attempted before.\n\nFor their human model, they will use Dr. Bertolt Meyer, a social psychologist at the University of Zurich, who has a bionic hand himself. Dr. Meyer had previously spent a lifetime experimenting with hooks and plastic hands with limited functionality, and he was one of the first in Switzerland to receive a groundbreaking bionic prosthetic, complete with a motor in every finger and a fully rotating wrist.  Now, while the engineers get to work, it will be Dr. Meyer's task to travel the world meeting the scientists behind the latest biological and technological marvels.\n\nLeading biomedical innovators have loaned the most sophisticated prosthetic parts available and currently used in medical science.  Until now, no one has ever attempted to combine them into a single functioning creature. THE INCREDIBLE BIONIC MAN follows Walker and Godden building the complex robot, from programming the mechanical arm to grasp objects and programming the legs to walk across the room, to connecting the \"brain,\" allowing it to communicate verbally.\n\nBut the Bionic Man doesn't just have a mechanical outer frame. It also features its own pumping heart and other critical organs in a circulatory system built by pioneering scientist Alex Seifalian, a professor of Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine at University College London. Seifalian and his team invented a ground-breaking polymer for building implantable organs of any shape, and have used it to create the world's first fully functioning veins and arteries.  Other artificial body parts featured in the Bionic Man include a heart from SynCardia Systems in Tucson, Ariz.; ankles and feet from BiOM in Bedford, Mass.; a lung from Haemair Ltd. in England; ears from Cochlear in Australia; a pancreas from De Montfort University in the UK; and a prototype kidney from the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAll of the individual components of the Bionic Man represent decades of research and ingenious solutions to mirroring what happens in the human body. An example is the bio-spleen contributed by the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. While the human spleen removes germs from blood with the help of white blood cells, the artificial spleen does the job with magnetic beads covered in germ-binding proteins. Infected blood from the patient is channeled through the spleen-on-a-chip, where the magnetic beads grab hold of the germs, producing cleansed blood that is then returned to the body.\n\nTHE INCREDIBLE BIONIC MAN also showcases people who have benefited from these emerging technologies\u2014like Hugh Herr, who as a teenager lost his legs after getting trapped in a blizzard. Today he's Director of Biomechatronics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.

They are also used on heavy equipment such as backhoes, which are required to operate on sites such as building demolition, where tire puncture is likely. Tires composed of closed-cell polyurethane foam are also made for bicycles and wheelchairs. The main advantage of airless tires is that they cannot go flat, but they are far less common than air filled tires.\nAirless tires generally have higher rolling resistance and provide much less suspension than similarly shaped and sized pneumatic tires. Other problems for airless tires include dissipating the heat buildup that occurs when they are driven. Airless tires are often filled with compressed polymers (plastic), rather than air.\nMichelin is currently developing an integrated tire and wheel combination, the \"Tweel\" (derived from \"tire\" and \"wheel,\" which, as the name \"Tweel\" suggests, are combined into one new, fused part), that operates entirely without air. Michelin claims its \"Tweel\" has load carrying, shock absorbing, and handling characteristics that compare favorably to conventional pneumatic tires. Automotive engineering group of mechanical engineering department at Clemson University is developing a low energy loss airless tire with Michelin through the NIST ATP project.\nResilient Technologies and the University of Wisconsin--Madison's Polymer Engineering Center are creating a \"non-pneumatic tire\", which is basically a round polymeric honeycomb wrapped with a thick, black tread. The initial version of the tire is for the Humvee and is expected to be available in 2011.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n\nNaked surfing girls", "title": "Airless tire test Humvee vs Hummer", "publishedDate": "2012-03-11T08:25:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4jYuiJdxbak", "description": "", "title": "Singapore State Visit: Carriage Procession", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T16:08:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4jYy6W5gf_8", "description": "Descri\u00e7\u00e3o", "title": "freud museum", "publishedDate": "2014-04-19T16:11:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4jZ-RtnzzGk", "description": "November marks National Vegan Month and today Yelp is featuring local business Peace Cafe, who specializes in Vegan Cuisine.

Apparently inspired from west, Bollywood actresses too are following the same trend to mark their entry in the glamour world. Check out the beauties of B-town who preferred to go under knife.\n\nKangana Ranaut\n\nKangana Ranaut entered Bollywood and made a place for herself with her different styles and her intense acting. However, soon the actress got a new look. All her fans were aware about her bug-bitten lips, but the actress went through a lip job. It was also reported that the actress, who is known for sexy figure and body, went for breast implants and soon she looked fuller and sexier. However, Kangana denied all the reports and claimed that she never had any surgery. \n\nGauhar Khan\n\nModel-turned-actress, Gauhar Khan went under the knife and got her lips enlarged which she was not happy with and chose to be away from the camera for some time. She had to cancel the shoot of her reality TV show Khan Sisters, after her lip augmentation surgery went wrong.\n\nMinissha Lamba\n\nMinissha Lamba grabbed more headlines for her alleged plastic surgeries than her films. She shocked all her fans, when after doing a nose job her look was revealed. She is known for her cute smile and simple looks, but chose to experiment with the wonders of plastic surgery and got a nose job done. However, the experiment didn't work for the pretty lady. According to reports, she also did silicone implants which made her look fit in her films.\n\nRakhi Sawant\n\nRakhi Sawant is one proud member of the implant bandwagon. She cannot resist herself to flaunt her cleavage on screen and as well in various parties. She has always been upfront about her plastic surgeries and the actress went through various experiments on her body. From liposuction to breast implants to shaping the jaw line, she tried almost everything. She also had a bad time for few wrong surgeries, where many criticized her too for the new look.\n\nKoena Mitra\n\nKoena Mitra, who grabbed headlines with her plastic surgery, went through a difficult phase when her nose job went wrong. The model entertained many in Bollywood with her sexy moves and hot body, but a botched-up nose job made her go through trauma. According to reports, after her surgery, her bones started swelling up. Koena's face was disfigured after the disastrous job. To get the job rectified she had to go through many surgeries.", "title": "Top 5 Plastic Surgeries Of Bollywood Actresses That Went Wrong", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T09:41:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4jZw5sbbZvo", "description": "Skin Medica Anti Aging Serum", "title": "Skin Medica - Anti Aging Serum", "publishedDate": "2011-09-05T21:44:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ja99_XTnYQ", "description": "Eohippus was a type of small, primitive horse that existed during the Eocene epoch, roughly 50 million years ago.

She has such a flippant lifestyle that she won't even give her cat a name, because that would be too much of a commitment to a relationship. Maintaining a childlike innocence yet wearing the most perfect of designer clothes and accessories from Givenchy, she spends her time on expensive dates and at high-class parties. She escorts various wealthy men, yet fails to return their affections after they have given her gifts and money. Holly's carefree independence is changed when she meets her neighbor, aspiring writer Paul (George Peppard), who is suffering from writer's block while being kept by a wealthy woman (Patricia Neal). Just when Holly and Paul are developing their sweet romance, Doc (Buddy Ebsen) appears on the scene and complicates matters, revealing the truth about Holly's past. Breakfast at Tiffany's was nominated for several Academy awards, winning Best Score for Henry Mancini and Best Song for Johnny Mercer's classic tune \"Moon River\".\n\n\"breakfast at tiffany's\",\"breakfast at tiffany's clip\",\"breakfast at tiffany's song\",\"breakfast at tiffany's movie\",\"audrey hepburn\",\"george peppard\",\"blake edwards\",\"drink videos\",\"romantic comedies\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"romance classics\",\"martin jurow\",\"hope videos\",\"apartment videos\",\"holly golightly\",\"paul fred varjak\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++6998,/m/0391v,/m/0dqcm", "title": "Breakfast at Tiffany's (1/9) Movie CLIP - The Mean Reds (1961) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T23:15:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4jsg05QDpuo", "description": "Akwarium: 900 litr\u00f3w. \nBiotop: jezioro Tanganika.

The Project tries to deal with various themes and ideas linked to the concept of the Image, such as Screen, Window, Canvas, Wall, Mirror, Reflection, Projection, Shadow, Duality, Double, Clone, The Same Of Other, Hiddenness, Mask, Illusion, Transparency, Smoke, Ghost, and so on...\nThe Project started with me trying to explore the concept of Allegory and so, first, I started researching and trying to understand the concept itself by reading Carlos Ceia's Dictionary of Literary Terms, then I focused on reading Allegorical works, both artistic and lyrical, like Plato's Cave, Dante's Divine Comedy, Hieronymus Bosch's paintings like Garden Of Earthly Delights and The Final Judgement... In the next phase I started to explore and experiment with several ideas that started to rise by reading all these works, and that's how this video experiment came to life. The first ideas focused on the Double, the same but in the state of other, a projection of a body and its reflection and the relationship between all of them, the confrontation between self and other-self, the confrontation between reality and a world of illusions and specters... There's also a Hiddenness between all these bodies, these bodies hide from themselves and they hide from the other (the projection). The Mirror works as a window (and maybe on a later experiment as a door) between worlds and also as a Screen, a Screen where we see nothing, a Screen where we se ourselves like Specters, like beings from other dimension...

These days we spend half of our lives looking through Screens, we live as Specters inside a world of illusions, and we use that Screen as a Window and as a Mirror, where we see ourselves as Projections and as Reflections of our beings, we create Doubles and Clones of our being, or our body, we create a same in the state of other, an Image...

So you know what there's a whole different set of rules here that you have to respect, and if you can't respect them you kind of have to walk away. One is you're not going to be meeting those kids for a while, you know, you've got to realize that there's somebody else in this relationship other you guys, and you always have to kind of protect the little ones, because they can't protect themselves. So you have to realize that you know what you're probably not going to be going to her house for a while, and there might be some you know push back a little bit. You have to be willing to except that because she has a bigger role to play in this. \n\nTwo is don't take her for granted because you know what, she's got a lot of other stuff on her plate so if you're looking to just get laid guys go find somebody else because, there's a lot more emotional involvement I think when it comes to dating someone with responsibilities. So it's all about being respectful, respecting her boundaries, and eventually respecting the fact that they're a package deal.

It is known for its thick walls, round arches, piers, groin vaults, large towers, and decorative arcading, as well as the measured articulation of volumes and surfaces. Romanesque architecture was the first distinctive style to dominate western and central Europe. The book explores the gestation of the style in the ninth and tenth centuries and its survival up to the fourteenth century. Notable structures include Speyer Cathedral, Sant Ambrogio in Milan, the abbeys of Cluny, and V zelay, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and Durham Cathedral, as well as the castles of Loches and Dover. A superb teaching tool, close to 400 illustrations pack this seminal text describing the design, function, and iconography of key church, monastic and secular buildings of a formative era. \n\n\"", "title": "[FREE PDF] Romanesque Architecture: The First Style of the European Age by Eric Fernie", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T22:18:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4k6d6J0_mdU", "description": "Now on iTunes: http://www.itunes.com/movies/crude2009 The story of a lawsuit by tens of thousands of Ecuadorans against Chevron over contamination of the Ecuadorean Amazon.", "title": "Crude - Official Trailer", "publishedDate": "2010-03-01T22:27:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4k6f3Ic3ARc", "description": "Timothy Holt.\n\nTitle: Instant Plinth.\nMedium: Assorted paint pots and hardboard.\nDimension: Variable.\nLocation: Variable.\nDate: 2010.\n\nA plinth is an architectural setting for sculpture that distinguishes it from the surrounding world, defines it as \"art\", ennobles and elevates it. In the Renaissance the plinth was virtually a work of art in itself. Perhaps the most elaborate base in western art is Cellini's 16th-century plinth for his statue of Perseus in Florence - he paid almost as much attention to its extravagant reliefs as he did to the statue.\n \nBy the 19th-century the plinth was a staid and boring institution. It was a manifestly pompous way of giving weak sculpture a bit of authority. And so the modernist revolution did away with it. One of the reasons Auguste Rodin is the father of modern sculpture is that his works bypass or escape the plinth by sprawling upward and outward. The Burghers of Calais make too wide a group for a conventional plinth - they spill off it. His Gates of Hell is a teeming vertical cascade of flesh that escapes into the air. The great tradition of modernist sculpture since Rodin - from Picasso to David Smith, from Barnett Newman to Richard Serra - no more belongs on a plinth than a Jackson Pollock painting belongs in a frame.\n \nThroughout the historical ages in art, doesn't the plinth deserve some credit, not even slight attention, without the symbolic stage - would the platform even arise to the state that it holds now! Creating an 'Instant Plinth' within a matter of seconds, absent from labour and time itself, commence attention notably differing the whole art making.

The snaffle bit is used to start horses.  It works by pull on each side of the mouth - so if you want to go right you pull on the right rein.  The curb bit works on leverage of the chin strap.  This chin strap can either be leather or chain.  When using a curb bit you must have your horse used to neck reining because this is not a direct pull bit.  Neck reining is laying the rein on the horses neck to cue them to turn.  You lay the rein on the opposite side of the neck from the way the horse turns.  So if you want to go left you lay the rein on the right side of the neck.

'Letting You Go (Greece 2000)' is a classic retouched fit to rule speakers once more.\n\nSome musical pieces follow us in history, growing and moving along with time. One of them is 'Greece 2000'. There's something everlasting about this Three Drives On A Vinyl classic, first released in 1997. It's been remixed hundreds of times and no matter how often you hear it, it never gets old.\nFor the 'Hands On Armada Vol.2' album, German producer duo Dabruck & Klein took on the challenge of remixing this ultimate classic  to great success. They've given it more volume, more power and higher dance floor potential. 'Letting You Go (Greece 2000)' holds on to the future, without losing the past. Strong female vocals and contagious, warm layers of melodic house will make you ride this new musical wave, unable to stop moving!\n\nProduced by: Flincke Jongens\nDirected by: Bas van Teylingen", "title": "Three Drives - Letting You Go (Greece 2000) (Dabruck & Klein Remix) Official Music Video", "publishedDate": "2011-12-12T11:33:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kP91nnOIsg", "description": "Dillon Precision Store room\nTheres a few more videos and pictures @ http://xl650reloadinglog.blogspot.com/", "title": "Dillon Precision Store room", "publishedDate": "2011-09-10T09:28:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kQnrKvOTNg", "description": "Butterball the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.

It is a member of the bustard family, which all belong to the order Gruiformes and are restricted in distribution to the Old World. It is one of the four species (ranging from Africa to India to Australia) in the large-bodied Ardeotis genus. In fact, the male Kori Bustard may be the heaviest living animal capable of flight. This species, like most bustards, is a ground-dwelling bird and an opportunistic omnivore. Male Kori Bustards, which can be more than twice as heavy than the female, attempt to breed with as many females as possible and then take no part in the raising of the young. The nest is a shallow hallow into the earth, often disguised by nearby obstructive objects such as trees. The specific epithet kori is derived from the Tswana name for this bird - Kgori.\n\nSubscribe to our Youtube page at http://www.youtube.com/user/genesisonetv", "title": "Kori bustard -- Colorful Birds", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T12:59:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kV_RAa9Wz8", "description": "Used in The Vampire Diaries Season 2 Episode 7.\nBrave by Tawgs Salter\nEnjoy.\n\nDisclaimer: No copyright infringement intended!

So far it is pretty damn good! As you can tell in the video review above I am very enthusiastic about it as the silly concept of e cigars is a pretty awesome reality.\n\nElectronic cigars have been around for a while, but this is my very 1st time trying one, and glad I did. The taste of a Cuban cigar is right there, no mistake about it. Every once in a while I like to enjoy a good cigar, and since I love vaping, electric cigars will be a regular part of my ecig collection.\n\nPerhaps you would like to try e cigars too? If you like a regular cigar you will most definitely like the Cuvana.  The best part is that you can smoke this sucker inside the house without hearing a lot of complaining from the ole battle ax (just kidding honey).\n\nTo order Cuvana e-cigars go to http://www.qsgi.com/cuvanaecigar and just add-to-cart.\n\nThe fun part is that you may choose just one or a box of 10 to share with your friends. No worries about recharging these as they are disposable - but last for a mind numbing 1800 puffs!  And a shelf life of 2 years, so it will be around a while for you to enjoy.\nVisit http://www.qsgi.com/ for cool e cig reviews. \n\n* Follow Us On Your Favorite Social Media!

VUR occurs in 1-2% of all children, but almost all children eventually out-grow their VUR.  Under normal conditions, urine moves in a one-way fashion from the kidney to the ureter to the bladder and out of the body.  When structural problems occur with any of these parts, urine can abnormally go back toward the kidneys instead of leaving the body through the urethra.  Children who have VUR may be at risk for frequent urinary tract infections, which, over time, may cause scarring in the kidney and reduced function.  Some types of VUR may be treated with antibiotics to prevent infections, while others may require surgery to prevent the backflow of urine to occur.", "title": "Vesicoureteral Reflux", "publishedDate": "2010-01-04T22:21:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kdvvg-gppY", "description": "Guitar tab now available at facebook.com/middlemanband\n\n \"It's Not Over Yet\" by MIDDLEMAN out now on Itunes here: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/its-not-over-yet/id391479383\n\nVideo Directed by Will Simpson and Dave Lynch.\nEdited by Tom Robinson.\nMake up by Doug Thompson and Aidan Marfleet.\n\n2010 BLIP RECORDS/ABSOLUTE/UNIVERSAL\n\nIt's not over yet - LYRICS\n\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.\n\nThe fuse is lit, and someone needs to stop it\nnot just watch it, take our hands out of our pockets. \nHow much do we want it?\nThe fuse skips, like the sparks in my veins,\nthe latter stages of frustration \nmaking blood tick in my brain\nlike tick tick, time's nearly up, tock,\nsoon there'll be nothing to salvage, nothing to count up, \nnothing to hope for, nothing but outrage.\nThings are volatile, we're close to detonation\nand instead of walking away from the red mist \nI'm inhaling.\n\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.\n\nMy fists are clenched, nails cutting flesh.\nThis has to last at least another night, it's not over yet!\nI'll fight for now with split knuckles,\nand smooth over rough edges \nwith sleepless-night sandpaper stubble.\nAnxious not to smash the cracked glass when I speak.\nThere's only so long I'll go on grinding my teeth.\nI'm tired, but I won't admit defeat \nuntil the whole thing shatters\nand we're all left in pieces.\n\nIt's brittle, but I'll battle while nothing's been broken,\nIt's not over yet.\nWe can handle the fractures, \nthey're nobody's fault lines.\nIt's not over yet.\nWe're close to the brink.\nIt's not over yet.\nNothing we can't fix,\nIt's not over yet.\nAnd we may be down but it's not over yet\ncause we'll never be out.\n\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.\nPlease give me something to calm me down, \ncause I can't seem to hold it off.\nYou're under my skin,\nand I'm not ready to give in.", "title": "Middleman - It's Not Over Yet", "publishedDate": "2010-07-11T20:32:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4keEPW3Hc70", "description": "Turquoise Coast - Turkish Riviera, Turkey Travel Guide HD\nWorld Travel https://www.youtube.com/user/World1Tube\nThe Turkish Riviera (also known popularly as the Turquoise Coast) is a term used to define an area of southwest Turkey encompassing the provinces of Antalya and Mu\u011fla, and to a lesser extent Ayd\u0131n, southern \u0130zmir and western Mersin. The combination of a favorable climate, warm sea, more than a thousand kilometers of shoreline along the Aegean and Mediterranean waters, and abundant natural and archeological points of interest makes this stretch of Turkey's coastline a popular national and international tourist destination.\n\nAmong the archeological points of interest are two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: The ruins of the Mausoleum of Maussollos in Halicarnassus; and the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.\n\nThe Turkish Riviera is also the home for the internationally-known Blue Voyage, which allows participants to enjoy a week-long trip on the locally-built gulet type schooners to ancient cities, harbors, tombs, mausolea and intimate beaches in the numerous small coves, lush forests and streams that lace the Turquoise Coast.\n\nThe coastline is further regarded as a cultural trove that provides a fascinating mixture of factual and mythological individuals, conflicts and events, and has frequently been referred to in the folklore of various cultures throughout history. As such, it is regarded as the home of scholars, saints, warriors, kings, and heroes, as well as the site of numerous well-known myths. Mark Antony of the Roman Empire is said to have picked the Turkish Riviera as the most beautiful wedding gift for his beloved Cleopatra of Egypt. St. Nicholas (who later became the basis of the Santa Claus legend) was born in Patara, a small town close to present-day Demre. Herodotus, regarded as the father of History, was born in Bodrum (ancient Halicarnassus) in c. 484 BC. The volcanic mountains to the west of Antalya, near Dalyan, are believed to have been the inspiration for the mythical Chimera -- the firebreathing monster that Bellerophon slew.\n=======================\nTurquoise Coast, Turquoise Coast Tours, Turquoise Coast Travel, Turquoise Coast Vacations, Turkish Riviera Travel, Turkish Riviera Tours, Turkish Riviera Tourism, Turkish Riviera Vacation, Turkish Riviera Hotels, Turkey, Turkey Travel Guide, Turkey Tourism, Turkey Vacation, Turkey History", "title": "Turquoise Coast - Turkish Riviera HD", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T19:52:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4keeKY7lpks", "description": "", "title": "Sphenoid/Mastoid Release", "publishedDate": "2011-11-01T11:03:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kehyqhZLLU", "description": "This is my Murakami Kong VS Devilfish model, which won Best Stand Alone Figure at G-Fest 19's Model Contest!", "title": "LeGrandzilla's King Kong VS Devilfish Model!", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T18:24:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kewxILeRQc", "description": "To access a comprehensive array of complete multimedia lessons visit http://www.newpathlearning.com\n\n-Meiosis http://newpathlive.com/kr \n\n--Sexual Reproduction \n---Sex Cells - Sperm and Eggs http://newpathlive.com/kt \n---Egg Fertilization http://newpathlive.com/ku \n---Sex Cell Chromosomes http://newpathlive.com/kv \n---The Zygote http://newpathlive.com/kw \n\n--Meiosis Overview \n---Meiosis Overview http://newpathlive.com/ky \n---Meiosis I Overview http://newpathlive.com/kz \n---Meiosis II Overview  http://newpathlive.com/l0 \n\n--Meiosis I \n---DNA Replication http://newpathlive.com/l2  \n---Prophase I http://newpathlive.com/l3  \n---Synapsis http://newpathlive.com/l4  \n---Metaphase I http://newpathlive.com/l5  \n---Anaphase I http://newpathlive.com/l6  \n---Telophase I and Cell Division http://newpathlive.com/l7 \n---End of Meiosis I http://newpathlive.com/l8  \n---Entire Process of Meiosis I Animation http://newpathlive.com/l9  \n\n--Meiosis II \n---Beginning of Meiosis II http://newpathlive.com/lb  \n---Prophase II http://newpathlive.com/lc  \n---Metaphase II http://newpathlive.com/ld  \n---Anaphase II http://newpathlive.com/le \n---Telophase II and Cell Division http://newpathlive.com/lf \n---End of Meiosis II http://newpathlive.com/lg \n---Sex Cells and Polar Bodies http://newpathlive.com/lh \n---Entire Process of Meiosis II Animation http://newpathlive.com/li\n\n--Pause and Interact \n---Review http://newpathlive.com/lk \n---Meiosis I Phases http://newpathlive.com/ll \n---Meiosis II Phases http://newpathlive.com/lm \n\n--Crossing-Over \n---Homologous Chromosomes http://newpathlive.com/lo  \n---Crossing-Over  http://newpathlive.com/lp\n---Crossed-Over Genes http://newpathlive.com/lq \n---Offspring Variation http://newpathlive.com/lr \n\n--Comparing Mitosis and Meiosis \n---Mitosis and Meiosis Overview http://newpathlive.com/lt \n---Comparing Mitosis and Meiosis http://newpathlive.com/lu \n---Number of Chromosomes http://newpathlive.com/lv \n---Daughter Cells and Sex Cells http://newpathlive.com/lw   \n\n--Pause and Interact        \n---Review http://newpathlive.com/ly \n\n--Vocabulary Review \n---Meiosis Vocabulary Matching http://newpathlive.com/m0 \n\n--Virtual Investigation \n---Build the Phases of Meiosis http://newpathlive.com/m2 \n\n--Assessment \n---Meiosis http://newpathlive.com/m4", "title": "Meiosis - Meiosis I", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T17:23:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kf8On1-Thc", "description": "Official music video for CUBICLE,  taken from the forthcoming Mixtape \"The Many Moods of OLU\" .

But we have to realize that it is not in the bag yet.\"\n\nItaly's once-proud defense looked old and slow. Van Nistelrooy tore through the Azzurri defense at will. With injured captain Fabio Cannavaro sitting on the bench next to his crutches, Marco Materazzi and Andrea Barzagli were picked apart by the Oranje attack.\n\nThe win put Netherlands in charge of the toughest first-round group. The Dutch have the only win Group C after France tied Romania 0-0 earlier in the day.\n\nThe Dutch carried several injuries into the match, but the Italians started with nine players over 30 and could not match the Netherlands for creativity and doggedness.\n\nVan Nistelrooy's breakthrough goal was claimed to be offside by Italy, but the striker deflected a 20-yard shot from Van Bronckhorst past Gianluigi Buffon with an Italy defender off the field next to the goal. That score equaled the number of goals Italy yielded in the run of play in the 2006 World Cup.\n\nThe second goal was a perfect counterattack. Van Bronckhorst kicked a ball off his own goal line and immediately rushed up the left, where he took a long pass from Rafael van der Vaart. The Italians were woefully out of position when Van Bronckhorst sent a defense-splitting pass to Dirk Kuyt on the right.\n\nKuyt, starting because of a groin injury to Arjen Robben, headed it perfectly into the path of Sneijder and the midfielder volleyed it past Buffon.\n\nEdwin van der Sar, the 37-year-old Netherlands goalkeeper, produced a stunning save on Andrea Pirlo's free kick to prevent Italy from getting back in the game in the 78th. Moments later, Van Bronckhorst made it 3-0 off a scramble in the Italy area.\n\nThe Italian fans displayed signs saying \"Spremuta d'Orange\"\u2014freshly squeezed orange juice\u2014but it was a Dutch squeezing that left the Azzurri blue.\n\n\"We have to go out onto the field believing we can win,\" coach Roberto Donadoni said.\n\n(by raf casert)", "title": "Holland / Netherlands vs. Italy Euro 2008 3 - 0 Slideshow", "publishedDate": "2008-06-09T22:05:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kpviQKbXQw", "description": "Reprobation playing their first show in 14 years(I think) for the Organ Donor Awareness Benefit.", "title": "Reprobation-The One They Hate, live @ The Blue Pig, Cudahy, WI 8/24/13", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T10:39:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kq9udoG4l0", "description": "Ali Seven Bile Bile Sevdim", "title": "Ali Seven Bile Bile Sevdim", "publishedDate": "2011-03-29T14:49:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kqZjvhEcEU", "description": "http://247hockeylife.com/score  // Goal Scoring Training\nhttp://247hockeylife.com/workouts  //  Free Hockey Workouts\n\nScore more goals and get more shots to the net with this move!", "title": "1 on 1 Move for Forwards - Hockey Training", "publishedDate": "2013-05-03T03:00:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4kr6mujvSeg", "description": "Chase heard mommy and daddy singing the beginning of this song as we reenacted Bill Murray in Caddy Shack before he attempts to blow up the gopher.

A cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name Elvis.[1] One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or \"the King\".\nBorn in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family at the age of 13. He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who went on to manage the singer for over two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", released in January 1956, was a number-one hit. He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African-American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.\nDrafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He staged few concerts however, and, guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, after seven years away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours. In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42.\nPresley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular culture. He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including country, pop ballads, gospel, and blues. He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music.[2][3][4][5] Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys, he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36. He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.", "title": "ELVIS MEMORIES COVERED ON YAMAHA PSR S900", "publishedDate": "2013-06-27T19:56:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4l1To6_Azhs", "description": "This video is a Prezi\u00ae, converted by PreziTube\u00ae\nCreate your own video from your Prezi\u00ae at PreziTube click: http://goo.gl/h3aa0V\n\nTitle: PTSD and Male Military Veterans\nAuthor: Robert Ortega\nOriginal Prezi\u00ae link: http://prezi.com/xttrjelzlbxh/\nDescription: \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis was a public and reusable Prezi at the time of conversion.

They point out she turned around a bankrupt country suffering constant strikes and high inflation, with very strong trade unions, paralysis of public services, high taxes and little wealth creation.\n\nKenneth Clarke, a minister in Thatcher's cabinet, outlined what he believes were her greatest achievements: \"The mainstream of her activity was to move over to market economics, and to get rid of the 'rust-bucket' legacy - which we'd been trying to keep going - of old-fashioned, heavy, loss-making industry; and absurd restrictive practices in public-sector owned industries as well. And she took on the professions, she took on the City, she believed that people should be responsible in the way they did things, and looking back, I think the main thing she did was modernise.\" \n\nOne of Thatcher's proudest achievements was the deregulated and liberalisation of the financial sector.\n\nLong time opponent  Ken Livingstone thinks that is what got us into the present mess: \"The crisis we are living in today is the legacy of Thatcherism, just like the crisis in America is the legacy of Reagan. We need a more fair society, we need a high-investment, high-skill economy, and there is no way out of this without that.\"\n\nThe debate remains as heated as when Thatcher was running Britain, but there is no denying that her radical ideology - free market economics - has become the dominant philosophy in most of the world.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Did Thatcher sow the seeds for today's crisis?", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T19:38:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4l7e2BYNQAE", "description": "LUL Schoma diesels arriving at North Weald with the 1960 Cravens Heritage unit @ the Epping Ongar Railway end of tube anniversary weekend", "title": "LUL Schoma diesels arriving at North Weald", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T21:05:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4l7m8w0wv0c", "description": "Esta jararaca foi encontrada por mim atrav\u00e9s do interessante comportamento de uma ave que habita \u00e0 regi\u00e3o de caatinga (nordeste), que \u00e9 a Gralha-canc\u00e3 ou Canc\u00e3o (Cyanocorax cyanpogon), estas aves, que andam sempre em bandos, t\u00eam como habito sempre que avistam uma serpente vocalizarem intensamente, aproximando-se perigosamente da mesma, hostilizando-a, inclusive, atraindo outras aves que se comportam da mesma forma, fazendo um grande alvoro\u00e7o notado por qualquer pessoa que esteja nas proximidades, revelando assim a presen\u00e7a da cobra.\n\nJararaca-da-seca (Bothrops erythromelas) \u00e9 uma serpente brasileira que pode se encontrada na regi\u00e3o nordeste (uma \u00e1rea restrita na por\u00e7\u00e3o meridional da Bahia).

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning around 3,400 years. Classical Athens, as a landlocked location was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC in later centuries on the rest of the then known European continent. Today a cosmopolitan metropolis, modern Athens is central to economic, financial, industrial, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2008, Athens was ranked the world's 32nd richest city by purchasing power and the 25th most expensive in a UBS study.\n \nThe city of Athens has a population of 664,046 (796,442 in 2004) within its administrative limits and a land area of 39 km2 (15 sq mi). The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond the administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,074,160 (in 2011), over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi). According to Eurostat, the Athens Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) is the 7th most populous LUZ in the European Union (the 4th most populous capital city of the EU), with a population of 4,013,368 (in 2004). Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland. \nThe heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.\n \nAthens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament (19th century) and the Athens Trilogy, consisting of the National Library of Greece, the Athens University and the Academy of Athens. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the 2004 Summer Olympics. Athens is home to the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, as well as the new Acropolis Museum.\nSource: wikipedia.org\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "title": "Athens (Greece) Collage Video - youtube.com/tanvideo11", "publishedDate": "2013-06-16T23:33:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "4l9ATXGe4Co", "description": "Found this beetle at a park near my university.

I am as curious as my cats, and indeed that has led to trouble often enough and used up several of my nine lives. I am an avid listener. I am fascinated by other people's lives, the choices they make and how that works out through time, what they have done and left undone, what they tell me and what they keep secret and silent, what they lie about and what they confess, what they are proud of and what shames them, what they hope for and what they fear. The source of my fiction is the desire to understand people and their choices through time..We do not currently have a precise policy on what will be done with the feral cat colonies..Playing octaves was just a coincidence. And it's still such a challenge, like chord versions, block chords like cats play on piano. There are a lot of things that can be done with it, but each is a field of its own. I used to have headaches every time I played octaves, because it was extra strain, but the minute I'd quit I'd be all right. But now I don't have headaches when I play octaves.\n\n\nMore Videos at our site: http://thecatschannel.com\n\n\nPlain Loafer Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nTags:catscatscats badday cat_instagram blackcats cats a_world_of_cats animalsofinstagram grumpycat babykitty catofinstagram catsofworld cutecat greycat camlcats animal animales black beautiful catstagram catsonintstagram amor siamesecats catinabag", "title": "104 Ways Kitties Can Find You the Love of Your Life", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T03:27:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lAQ_y4_WYg", "description": "3rdiiiUth.

(NYSE MKT: CANF) (CFBI.TA), a biotechnology company advancing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drugs that address cancer and inflammatory diseases, today announced that an article titled, \"New Drugs and Treatment Targets in Psoriasis,\" published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Acta Derm Venereologica, cites the Company's CF101 as a potential treatment for psoriasis. The article was written by researchers at the Department of Dermato-allergology, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. To read the article in full, please visit: Acta Derm Venereologica.\n\nThe article states that biologics for the treatment of psoriasis are costly, require repeated injections, and some patients experience a loss of therapeutic effect. Thus, the development of orally available, small molecule drugs are desirable, state the article's authors. They identify A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonists as one of four potential small molecules currently in clinical trials. \n\nThe article includes a summary of Can-Fite's Phase II psoriasis trial and includes CF101 among four small molecule drugs under development including Pfizer's Tofacitinib, Celgene's Apremilast, and Incyte's Ruxolitinib.\n\n\"There is a need for small molecule orally bioavailable drugs for the treatment of psoriasis which is a chronic disease. We believe the good safety and efficacy profile that has been described in the Phase II and Phase II/III interim analysis, positions CF101 as a leading drug under development for this  disease,\" stated Dr. Pnina Fishman, CEO of Can-Fite. \n\nCan-Fite's Phase II/III psoriasis trial is ongoing with top line results expected to be released in the first quarter of 2015. The psoriasis therapeutic market was worth $3.6 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow to $6.7 billion by 2018, according to Global Data.", "title": "Can Fite's Drug CF101 is Presented in Scientific Journal for the Treatment of Psoriasis", "publishedDate": "2014-09-18T19:19:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lKBD2U2nAk", "description": "Dave Lieberman learns how to make burgoo at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Owensboro Kentucky in this episode of Hellmann's In Search of Real Food series.\nGet all episodes at: http://food.yahoo.com/realfood/", "title": "Owensboro Kentucky: Burgoo", "publishedDate": "2007-08-06T19:56:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4lKER8A62pk", "description": "La Dra.
