If you do, you may have a VA claim. A veterans attorney explains in this video more about these types of claims and how to prove your claim for PTSD.  In order to receive claim benefits for post traumatic stress disorder, a veteran must have a diagnosis from a doctor.  VA requirements surrounding  claims for PTSD  have changed since 2010. While veterans no longer have to prove through a specific document what happened to them in service, they do have to be diagnosed by a VA doctor. If a VA doctor is unwilling to diagnose PTSD but a doctor outside of VA has diagnosed the disease, veterans must then prove that they were exposed to a traumatic event though a document or witness statement.  For help proving your claim for PTSD so that you can receive VA benefits, please call veterans benefits lawyer Sean Kendall at (877) 699-1712 or (303) 449-4773 or contact us online at  http://www.seankendalllaw.net/contact.cfm .", "title": "What it Takes to Prove a PTSD Claim for VA Benefits", "publishedDate": "2013-07-10T15:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YedTkim558", "description": "", "title": "Le Potin Gourmand", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T13:08:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YetuLiYHLQ", "description": "U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made the following remarks on the Senate Floor regarding his legislation, the Protecting Our Infants Act.", "title": "McConnell Introduces Bill to Help Combat Maternal Addiction and Infant Opiate Dependency", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T15:39:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YfpBbPDVZA", "description": "Executive Spray Tan Parties | Tan your bod while you dance\n\nTan your body places and party with the chicks all night long at your local spray tan party.", "title": "Executive Spray Tan Parties", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T16:07:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YgFdJsKnIQ", "description": "NOT FOR BROADCAST OR COMMERCIAL USE!\n\nFootage of an unknown wreck resting in 240 feet of water off Miami.", "title": "KEY BISCAYNE MYSTERY WRECK", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T00:31:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YgP-qTvoQw", "description": "Prepare for the Reaper invasion as the alien fleet tears apart earth in the new game Mass Effect 3.

Hemorrhoids remedy can be of the following types.Hemorrhoids remedy types:Soft and easy bowel movements- \n\nDon't strain you bowel it's one of the best curative and preventive measures for Hemorrhoids remedy.Diet and food habits- Eat food, which helps to ease digestion and smooth stool passage. \n\nFor example have more fluids, fruits and vegetables rather than bread, soda, etc.Home treatments- Applying ice on the area, Sitz bath, herbal remedies like horse chest nut extract, etc are some of the home treatment methods of Hemorrhoids remedies.Creams- \n\nAnother common Hemorrhoids remedy that helps to curb swelling of irritated hemorrhoidal tissues are Hemorrhoids creams. It also gives immediate and temporary relief from the painful burning, itching and discomfort of hemorrhoids. \n\nInternal and External Hemorrhoids remedy\n\nTreatment for External Hemorrhoids remedy\n\nThe hemorrhoids may be removed surgically or through other methods in extreme cases. Three surgical procedures to remove external hemorrhoids are- \n* laser coagulation- The hemorrhoid is clotted with an electric probe which makes it shrink.\n* Infrared photocoagulation- The hemorrhoid is clotted with infrared light to make it shrinks.\n* Hemorrhoidectomy- Complete removal of the hemorrhoid. \n\nTreatment for internal Hemorrhoids remedy\n* Rubber Band Ligation - In this process a small rubber band is placed at the base of the internal hemorrhoid. The blood supply to the hemorrhoid is cut off hence resulting in it to shrink up and fall off in about four to seven days. \n* Injection Sclerotherapy - A chemical solution is injected into the mucous membrane near the hemorrhoid resulting in inflammation and closure of the veins, thereby shrinking the hemorrhoid. \n* Infrared Photocoagulation - An infrared is directed to clot the dilated veins of the hemorrhoid. The hemorrhoids shrink since the blood does not flow through the coagulated blood vessels. \n* Laser Coagulation - An electric current is applied to the hemorrhoids triggering a chemical reaction that shuts down the blood supply in the hemorrhoid and causes the inflamed tissue to shrink. \n* Hemorrhoidectomy - Here the hemorrhoid groups are surgically removed with a scalpel, cattery device or laser. What should the Hemorrhoids remedy doIt should relieve pain and discomfort from hemorrhoids. \n\nReduce itching, prevents bleeding, eliminate swelling and burning. It should heal and shrinks the hemorrhoid and prevent hemorrhoids from returning due to its power to strengthen the veins tone. \n\nIn case of surgery caution must be taken.It should do the appropriate repair of damaged tissues.\n\nFor more information visit http://tinyurl.com/GetRidOfHemorrhoidsNow", "title": "Hemorrhoids Remedy", "publishedDate": "2012-11-25T22:27:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Z3sYjbsLxw", "description": "James singing Since you've been gone.", "title": "The coal Hole", "publishedDate": "2007-02-25T17:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Z3vvYLk8uk", "description": "Parmi les pistes scrut\u00e9es par les enqu\u00eateurs, celle de l'acte terroriste est d\u00e9sormais en partie \u00e9voqu\u00e9e (Interpol doute de cette piste, la CIA ne l'\u00e9carte pas).

Here\u2019s how Occipital describes it:\n\n\u201cThe Structure Sensor uses structured light to capture depth data. Structured light uses a laser projector to cast a precise pattern of thousands of invisible infrared dots onto objects and spaces. It then uses a frequency-matched infrared camera to record how the pattern changes, thereby understanding the geometry of those objects and spaces. As a result, the Structure Sensor can generate a VGA depth stream at 30 frames per second, with each pixel representing an exact distance to a real-world point.\u201d\n\nRead our hands on review here: http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/can-now-3d-scan-objects-ipad-fun-sounds/", "title": "Occipital 3D Structure Sensor", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T19:13:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZFgWqOF65U", "description": "greja do Evangelho Quadrangular = A Igreja Internacional do Evangelho Quadrangular foi fundada pela evangelista Aimee Semple McPherson. \nAimee Elizabeth Kennedy nasceu em Ingersoll, Ont\u00e1rio, Canad\u00e1, em 9 de outubro de 1890.\nIEQ no Brasil = Fundada em S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Boa Vista - SP a 15 de novembro de 1951, pelo mission\u00e1rio da Foursquare Church Gospel Pastor Harold Edwin Willians (falecido no dia 11 de setembro de 2002 - para ver a mat\u00e9ria clique aqui) auxiliado pelo Pastor Jesus Hermirio Vasquez Ramos. o primeiro natural de Los Angeles- EUA e o segundo natural do Peru.", "title": "Hino da Igreja do Evangelho Quadrangular   Legendado", "publishedDate": "2013-12-12T17:01:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZFqrMdzuNs", "description": "Il secondo singolo di Jacopo Ratini", "title": "Jacopo Ratini - Ho fatto i soldi facili", "publishedDate": "2010-09-17T10:23:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZFx7buVtqo", "description": "", "title": "1er mai 2009 rue Soufflot 2", "publishedDate": "2009-05-02T13:05:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZH9_Kj95-o", "description": "", "title": "CULTIVO DE GANODERMA EN TRONCO Y METODO CASERO", "publishedDate": "2013-06-09T22:27:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZHoYHYym8A", "description": "EDIT: Disabled comments - this is super old.\n\nA crossover animation of Okami and LOZ: Twilight Princess, some of my favourite video games :3.

Hence why the first twenty seconds are terrible and the rest is good.\nI'm quite pleased with it, and it's sort of a thanks to the 67 subscribers i've somehow managed to accumulate.\nAnyhoo, to avoid annoying animation questions:\n\nQ&A\n\nQ. What program did you use for this?\nA. For the first twenty or so seconds i used GIMP and Pencil. But then afterwards i just used Photoshop Elements 9. It's my first time animating with photoshop and i was eager to give it a try! It was compiled and rendered in Cyberlink Powerdirector 8 Deluxe.\n\nQ. Why did you do the markings of the wolves weird?\nA. I admit, the markings vary slightly from shot to shot for the simple reason that the colouring was a bit of a rush job. Sorry :3\n\nQ. Can you teach me how to animate?\nA. Depends on how much time i've got. I can certainly direct you to some good tutorials and guides.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video (and could be bothered to read down to here in the description :I ), PLEASE check out my channel and subscribe.

Feldman, Andrew Niccol, Richard Luke Rothschild, Scott Rudin, Lynn Pleshette\nScreenwriter: Andrew Niccol\nFilm Description: Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script. Exteriors were filmed in the Victorian-styled upscale community of Seaside, Florida. In addition to the Burkhard Dallwitz score, original music by Philip Glass and classical excerpts are also featured.\n\n\"the truman show\",\"the truman show clip\",\"the truman show trailer\",\"the truman show part 1\",\"jim carrey\",\"ed harris\",\"natascha mcelhone\",\"peter weir\",\"door videos\",\"monitors videos\",comedy,\"showbiz dramas\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"scott rudin\",\"richard luke rothschild\",\"edward s feldman\",\"andrew niccol\",\"lynn pleshette\",\"freedom videos\",\"manipulation videos\",\"moving on videos\",\"parenthood videos\",\"control room videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++161628,/m/0lx2l,/m/017149,/m/02dvwl", "title": "The Truman Show (9/9) Movie CLIP - Truman Talks to the Creator (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T20:04:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZMqH-XXWhk", "description": "SCOWL BROW\n\"Don't Give A Damn\"\nSong Recorded by: Patrick Boyd\nFilmed & Edited by \u00a9 BASICWILD (Justin Smith & Josh Faggart) | 2014\nFilmed at Sioux Sioux Studio in Plaza Midwood", "title": "SCOWL BROW - Don't Give a Damn", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T16:01:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZMxlsjI6OQ", "description": "District One's Cashmere death.

When the forces of natural selection weaken with adult age, declining survival and fertility evolve in adulthood, and thus produce the decline in health which is commonly called 'aging.'\nIn animals like mammals and insects, the Force of Natural Selection acting on mortality proportionately scales as follows.  Childhood:  From birth to the start of reproduction in a population, it acts with 100% of its maximum force.  During this phase of life, therefore, natural selection acts strongly to sustain our inborn health, in terms of our capacity to survive, which can be thought of as our basic functional integrity.  Even at full strength, natural selection won't always succeed; accident, contagious disease, and mutation can all degrade health during the childhood years.  But it does a damn good job.  Aging Phase:  From the earliest ages of reproduction until the last age of reproduction, the mortality Force steadily declines.  During this phase of life, natural selection progressively weakens its evolutionary surveillance of our health, resulting in predictable, general, and sustained declines in our health.  Late-life Phase:  After the last age of reproduction, and forever after, age-specific natural selection is gone.  At this point, our health is sustained only by the age-independent health benefits built by natural selection for earlier ages.  However, in many animal populations, this late-life phase features relatively reasonable health, and the preservation of some useful function.  But it does not among humans in industrial countries, an issue that we will discuss in detail later in the 55.\nIn animals like mammals and insects, the Force of Natural Selection acting on fecundity scales as follows.  Childhood:  From birth to the start of reproduction in a population, the fecundity Force progressively falls.  However, since we do not reproduce during this period, this has no observable effect. Aging Phase:  During the earliest ages of reproduction, there is usually a transitional period during which fecundity increases rapidly with adult age.  This can be thought of as the developmental result of all the quantitative effort that natural selection is putting into enabling the adult organism to develop the anatomical structures, physiological functions, and reproductive behaviors required for successful reproduction.  Thus, in teen-aged humans, the first years of basic reproductive capacity are marked by relatively poor fertility, inappropriate or misdirected sexual behavior, and poor parenting behavior.  But quickly, the adult human develops its full reproductive capacity, at around the age of 20 years in men, somewhat later in women.  After that, fertility falls with age, the other side of declining health during adult life.  Note that in mammalian species, which have a great deal of parental care of offspring, an infertile adult caring for their immediate offspring is still effectively reproducing.  That is to say, in evolutionary terms reproductive function extends past female menopause.  Late-life Phase:  After the last age of survival in the evolutionary history of a population, age-specific natural selection for the maintenance of fecundity is gone.  During this epoch of life, our reproductive functions are sustained only by age-independent benefits built by natural selection for earlier ages.  However, in many animal populations, this late-life phase features measureable reproductive function.  But it does not among humans in industrial countries, an issue that we will discuss in detail later in the 55.", "title": "Thesis 10 part 2", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05T14:24:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZYmduHdwfM", "description": "http://www.cheaphumidors.com/a/prettyband\n\nSosa Wavell Maduro\nOrnate gold designs on the band conceal Dominican tobaccos with a diverse array of flavors. With varying wrappers of either Ecuadorian Sumatra or Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro, you never know what enjoyment might await you.\n\nHi, I'm Nada with smokingcigargirl and today I'm going to be reviewing the Sosa Wavell Robusto Maduro. This is a 5 x 50 cigar with a Connecticut broadleaf wrapper and Dominican binder and filler. This cigar has a very rustic dry looking wrapper, a couple of visible veins and the wrapper is mottled. There is an earthy aroma at the foot of the cigar and a hint of cocoa. There is a very rich cocoa flavor on the cold draw.\n\nThe cigar starts off with a bit of pepper on the front of the palate and it's not very bold but there is a hint of it there and a little bit of dry woodiness on the finish. I'll be back in a few minutes to discuss the first third of this cigar. \n \nThe first third of this cigar has had mostly citrus and floral notes on the front of the palate. The finish started off pretty dry and woodsy and getting less so throughout the first third. The draw on this cigar so far is excellent and the burn has been very even and consistent and the ash has been holding on great so far.\n\nThe floral notes of this appeared from the front of the palate on the second third of this cigar and the flavors are now mostly citrusy. There is also a hint of pepper now on the finish. This cigar continues to have an excellent burn. \n \nThe final third of this Sosa Wavell Maduro Robusto started off with some floral notes on the front of the palate and more pepper notes on the finish. As the cigar has progressed through the final third, the pepper notes have picked up on the front of the palate and the finish so this is becoming a mostly peppery cigar.\n\nThis cigar has had a great draw throughout the whole smoke as well as a very even and consistent burn. I haven't had to relight or touch up the cigar at all since I lit it. The ash has also hung on very well I've just been tapping it out occasionally.\n\nThis cigar is a medium bodied cigar mostly due to the flavor it picks up towards the end and probably a mild to medium strength cigar, maybe medium at best. So it is really a good any time of day smoke, afternoon or first cigar of the evening.\n\nAs always I'd love to hear what you thought of this review and if there is anything you'd like to see me review in the future and if you'd like to check out my sponsor Cheaphumidors.com you can find them on Facebook under www.facebook.com/cheaphumidors.", "title": "Sosa Wavell Robusto Maduro Review by SmokingCigarGirl", "publishedDate": "2013-11-19T14:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZZ_G03jSmk", "description": "1966\u5e74\u306e\u3057\u3057\u5ea7\u6d41\u661f\u7fa4\u306e\u5927\u51fa\u73fe\u3092Stellarium\u3067\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\n\n\u4f7f\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\uff1aStellarium\nBGM\uff1a\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u97f3\u697d\u7d20\u6750 H/MIX GALLERY\nhttp://www.hmix.net/", "title": "\u3010 \u3057\u3057\u5ea7\u6d41\u661f\u5d50 \u3011 The Leonid Meteor Storm", "publishedDate": "2012-06-24T05:08:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZZnK1nLuks", "description": "Here's an interesting but useless fact: Tridactyla is actually part of the scientific name for the Giant anteater.

Soon after overthrowing Batista, Guevara choreographed the executions of hundreds of Batista officials without any fair trials. He thought nothing of summarily executing even fellow guerrillas suspected of disloyalty and shot one himself with no due process.\n\nChe was a purist political fanatic who saw everything in stark black and white. Therefore he vociferously opposed freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly, protest, or any other rights not completely consistent with his North Korean-style communism. \n\nHow many rock music-loving teens sporting Guevara t-shirts today know their hero supported Cuba\u2019s 1960\u2019s repression of the genre? \n\nHow many homosexual fans know he had gays jailed? \n\nWhat do you think?", "title": "Che Guevara was good or bad? 10 unknown facts that will help you decide", "publishedDate": "2014-09-26T12:36:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZbC7bZJ-Yw", "description": "Ebony Magazine\u2019s \"Power 100\" list of influential black Americans is set to be released next week, and Ebony editor-in-chief Mitzi Miller joined ET to preview the obvious selections as well as some surprising new additions to the list.", "title": "Ebony\u2019s \u2018Power 100\u2019 List Revealed", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T02:55:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZbIPLw5auA", "description": "", "title": "Choreo of OOB Pro & Top to Mako!Mako's  'Cuba' at TSR 2010", "publishedDate": "2011-02-13T00:00:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Zc5iy_3nQM", "description": "sneakerwatch.com - No stranger to the sneaker game, Bronx native Fat Joe, was able to chat it up with SneakerWatch about who he thinks has the best collection, his thoughts on retros, sneaker culture growing up in The Bronx, and how the kick game has changed.\nWhen it comes to other collectors besides himself, Fat Joe gives credit to other artists such as Wale and DJ Khaled.

Contact http://www.stockshot.nl/ \u00a9\n- By its body proportions, antlers' shape and size, and demeanor, the moose is the mighty symbol of the boreal and subarctic zones of the entire northern hemisphere. North Americans refer to this animal as MOOSE; an Indian word meaning \"eater of twigs\". In Europe, it is known as elk. The scientific name, alces alces, also translates into British English as elk.\n\nDe eland is de grootste nog levende hertensoort: hij wordt minstens zo groot als een paard. De eland leeft voornamelijk van scheuten en twijgen van bomen. De eland komt voornamelijk voor in naaldbossen. Hij heeft een voorkeur voor meer drassige streken als riviervalleien en meren. De eland is een uitstekende zwemmer en is regelmatig in het water te vinden.\nHij dol op waterplanten steekt graag zijn kop onderwater om de lekkerste planten te pakken.\nElanden zijn solitaire dieren. Ze bezetten geen vast territorium. In principe ontmoeten de dieren elkaar alleen in de paartijd.\nAlleen de mannetjes hebben gewei dat zo'n 6 tot 8 kilo kan wegen. Dit gewei wordt schoffel-gewei genoemd. Elk najaar wordt het gewei afgeworpen en in de zomer van het volgende jaar is het nieuwe gewei volledig ontwikkeld.\nElanden leven zelden in kuddes. In de winter vindt men wel kleine groepen, meestal families (vaak onder leiding van een oude koe). Als regel leven elanden echter solitair.\nDe belangrijkste natuurlijke vijand is de wolf.\n\n\u00a9 All Rights reserved by Fauna Film B.V. http://www.faunafilm.nl\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\n http://twitter.com/tvgreen\n\nFollow us on Pinterest:\nhttp://pinterest.com/faunafilm/\nhttp://pinterest.com/stockshot/\nhttp://pinterest.com/dreamshot/\n\nPlease subscribe, share & comment us on YouTube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/dreamshot\nhttp://www.youtube.com/screenshot\nhttp://www.youtube.com/stockshot\nhttp://www.youtube.com/tvgreenmagazine", "title": "Wild Peers: moose - elk - alces alces - eland", "publishedDate": "2012-09-10T14:25:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZeBtro87mg", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/user/daihocoi?sub_confirmation=1\nLuy\u1ec7n Thi \u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ecdc, Luy\u1ec7n Thi Online, Luy\u1ec7n Thi Tr\u1ef1c Tuy\u1ebfn: To\u00e1n H\u1ecdc, V\u1eadt L\u00fd, H\u00f3a H\u1ecdc, Sinh V\u1eadt, L\u1ecbch S\u1eed, \u0110\u1ecba L\u00fd, V\u0103n H\u1ecdc, Anh V\u0103n", "title": "Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Ph\u00e1p Gi\u1ea3i C\u00e1c Ba\u0300i T\u1eadp \u0110\u1eb7c Bi\u1ec7t V\u1ec1 Ancol Phenol, Th\u1ea7y V\u0169 Kh\u1eafc Ng\u1ecdc", "publishedDate": "2013-12-12T03:49:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZeGl32s0rE", "description": "A spin on the classic", "title": "The Halloween Bus", "publishedDate": "2014-02-25T17:12:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZeWo-uXU3c", "description": "", "title": "Buschrohrs\u00e4nger, Acrocephalus dumetorum, Braunschweiger Rieselfelder, NI (D) 30-05-2011", "publishedDate": "2012-05-14T14:56:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ZepJKkMc30", "description": "Ayrton Senna ganha o \u00faltimo t\u00edtulo mundial do Brasil na F1\n\nGostou do Video?

It\u2019s not nearly as daunting if you break it down into steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Decide your objective\nSpend some time thinking about what you want your paper to accomplish. Do you want it to prove your viewpoint? Explain a topic? You\u2019ll want to have a clear focus before you begin your research.\n\nStep 2: List key words\nMake a list of key words that will be helpful in locating information when you conduct online and offline searches. \n\nStep 3: Go to the library\nGo to the library. Yeah, we know\u2014you think you can find everything you need with your laptop. But to get an actual book on a topic, plus find academic papers, journals, and other subscriber-only materials, you\u2019ll need to head to a library.\n\nTip\nIf your library doesn\u2019t have a book you need, ask the librarian to borrow it from another branch. \n\nStep 4: Check library indexes\n Use the library\u2019s indexes to find articles in periodicals, like trade journals and magazines. They\u2019ll contain the very latest information on your subject.\n\nTip\nNote your sources carefully as you go along to make the bibliography easier\u2014and to prevent plagiarism!\n\nStep 5: Go online\nOkay, now you can do some online research by plugging in those key words you listed at the start. Only take information from reputable sites and organizations.\n\nTip\nConsider interviewing an expert in the field you\u2019re researching. It\u2019s a guaranteed way to impress your professor. \n\nStep 6: Find statistics\nWhile you\u2019re researching the facts, don\u2019t forget the figures. Find useful statistics. \n\nTip\nHelpful search words for stats include 'percent of,' 'Census Bureau,' and 'survey results.'\n\nStep 7: Don't forget the videos\nDon\u2019t forget the videos. See if there are any documentaries on your topic.\n\nStep 8: Start writing\nOrganize your research, mull it over, and then start writing! \n\nDid You Know?\nDid you know?

That means putting a camera on a aircraft and shoot some video or photos from the sky. Sometimes ago some people invented a motorized gimbal and put that on a RC Drone, that worked beautifully! Perfectly stabilized and horizontal video footage, very smooth, just like shooting on rail dolly, this is some high tech stuff you see in hollywood movie, now you can put it on your drone. But hey, can I use in on hand, NOT on a drone? Can I held held it for normal video shooting? Now you can, with this Handheld 3-Axis Stabilizer!\n\n3-Axis is refering to Pitch, Roll and Pan axis, when you are walking or even running, the gyrosope inside the gimbal will pick up your movement and tell all three motors to counter-act your movement and keep the gimbal stable, the result is giving you extremely smooth and fluent video, all these happens in a fraction of a second and it does that seamlessly you won't even notice how that worked, you just see the camera stay horizontal, the video you'll get is like you are shooting on a Dolly Grip, this is an amazing Gadget, in fact, this technology was originally designed for Professinal Filming, now you can get this \"Magical\" item at much lower cost. \n\nSo we have a Brushless Motor Gimbal placed on a stick, and inside this stick there are 3 X Lithium battery, providing 12V power to the gimbal to work 1.5~2 hours non-stop, there is only one button on the handle, it controls the Gimbal Angle and to change Modem the operation cannot be anymore simpler, basically just point an shoot, there is a ON/OFF switch at the end of the handle, just put a GoPro 3 camera on the gimbal, press the ON button, wait for 10 seconds to let to start up, and you have yourself a hollywood grade motorized GoPro gimbal. You could be creative with this stabilizer, we strap it on a motorcycle helmet and got some interesting footage, you can checkout the youtube video below. =)\n\nhttp://www.helipal.com/handheld-gopro-stabilizer-3-axis.html", "title": "Feiyu G3 Ultra 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal on Motorcycle - HeliPal.com", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T10:23:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_52SDphbdM", "description": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f. \u041d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0441 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440\n\u0421\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0441\u044f. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043a.\n\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f!\n\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435! \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435! \n\u0421\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCorP6j2j0zfzyymxN81Jh7A?feature=g-subs-u", "title": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f. \u041d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0441 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T09:04:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_5LiCGQdKU", "description": "\u5148\u9032\u904b\u8ee2\u652f\u63f4\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u300cEyeSight Ver.2\u300d\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u8868\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u300c\u3076\u3064\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff01\uff1f\u30df\u30cb\u30ab\u30fc\u300d\u304c\u516c\u5712\u3084\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9\u3001\u30a8\u30b9\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u6d77\u306a\u3069\u3092\u6563\u6b69\u3059\u308b\u52d5\u753b\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u25a0EyeSight Ver.2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\nhttp://www.subaru.jp/eyesight/\n\n\u25a0\u300c\u3076\u3064\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff01\uff1f\u30df\u30cb\u30ab\u30fc\u300d\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30da\u30fc\u30f3\u6982\u8981\nhttp://www.subaru.jp/campaign/topics/eyesight_minicar_campaign/\n\n\u203b\u30df\u30cb\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u5b9f\u8eca\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3068\u306f\u7570\u306a\u308a\u3001\u524d\u65b9\u306b\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u8d64\u5916\u7dda\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u3067\u969c\u5bb3\u7269\u3092\u691c\u77e5\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u203b\u3076\u3064\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30df\u30cb\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u52d5\u4f5c\u306b\u306f\u500b\u4f53\u5dee\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "title": "The walk of minicar.", "publishedDate": "2012-08-10T06:38:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_5YiARQXsY", "description": "Counterpoise EP 1998\nhorror of the state", "title": "counterpoise - horrorofthestate", "publishedDate": "2012-01-11T01:00:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_65t6Kaxdc", "description": "Song : Rai Rai Rai\nVocals : Hanatan\nComposer : Kikuo\n\nI Do not own any of the contents", "title": "\u3010\u82b1\u305f\u3093\uff0f\u30e6\u30ea\u30ab\u3011Rai Rai Rai~Primrose Flower Voice", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T11:30:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_6KWlI15mI", "description": "Next time you're cutting into a pumpkin, don't toss the seeds!

It was rather bitter but once I sweetened it with Licorice root and golden raw Mango Honey, it went rather nicely with dark chocolate coated almond cookies. I posted a note earlier today about the health benefits of olive leaves. Wilde sage adds a beautiful sweet yet sharp floral flavor to the tea. The Eucalyptus and olive leaf made the tea bitter. Anyone who lives in the Hollywood hills or visits them in the spring time after a fresh rain, knows the smell of the wild sage in the hills.  CA WIld Sage can be used in cooking as a spice and has also been used in the past for a treatment to fight coughs and colds.\n\nOnly getting 4 hours of sleep last night I was remarkably energized through out the day and I am crediting the olive leaf in the tea as that is what one of the reported benefits are, increased energy levels.\n\nAs you can see, maintaining good health, demonstrating successful remedies and validated data regarding these herbs has become a hobby of mine. This data regarding olive leafs has been around for eons!  I hope I can help others rediscover its benifits and have more proactive natural options for maintaining good health.\n\nBelow is more data regarding Olive leaf extract.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians may have been the first to figure out that the olive leaf packs extraordinary power. They considered the leaf a symbol of heavenly power. In keeping with that belief, they extracted the oil and used it to mummify their kings.\nLater cultures discovered that the leaf was better used protecting the living than the dead. Throughout the ages, it was a popular folk remedy for combating fevers.\n\nIn the 1850's, medical reports described how olive leaves cured the worst cases of malaria. An 1854 acount in the Pharmaceutical Journal provided the following simple healing recipe: A handful of leaves boiled in a quart of water down to half its original volume. A wine glassful was then administered until the fever was cured. The author believed that a bitter substance in the leaves was the key healing ingredient. This method was said to be extremely popular in England to treat sick returnees from the tropical colonies.\n\nEarly in this century, a bitter compound from the leaf called oleuropein was indeed isolated and determined to be part of the olive tree's powerful disease-resistant properties. According to scientists, it's the stuff that helps protect the tree against insect and bacterial predators. Oleuropein is and iridoid, a structural class of chemical compounds found in plants. It is present throughout the olive tree and is, in fact, the bitter material that is eliminated from the olives when they are cured.\n\nIn 1962, a scientific paper written by an Italian researcher reported that oleuropein had the ability to lower blood pressure in animals. Other European researchers confirmed this finding and found also that it could increase blood flow in the coronary arteries, relieve arrhythmias and prevent intestinal muscle spasms. About the same time, other investigators were searching for the chemical agent within oleuropein that might be the most medically potent. A Dutch researcher found it: elenolic acid. What's more, the Europeans found it had a powerful anti-bacterial effect.\n\nIn the late 1960's, research by scientists at a major American pharmaceutical company showed that elenolic acid also inhibited the growth of viruses. In fact, it stopped every virus that it was tested against. A number of in vitro (test tube) laboratory experiments with calcium elenolate, a salt of elenolic acid, demonstrated a killer effect against many viruses, bacteria and parasitic protozoans. Among other effects, the compound was found to be potent against a variety of viruses associated with the common cold. Researchers believed a number of mechanisms were involved in its ability to combat microorganisms:\n\nA critical interference with certain amino acid production processes necessary for the vitality of a specific virus.\nInterference with viral infection and/or spread by inactivating viruses or by preventing virus shedding, budding or assembly at the cell membrane.\nThe ability to directly penetrate infected host cells an irreversibly inhibit viral replication.\nIn the case of retroviruses, it neutralizes the production of reverse transcriptase as well as protease. These enzymes are essential for a retrovirus, such as HIV, to alter the RNA of a healthy cell.\nA direct stimulation of phagocytosis, an immune system response in which cells ingest microorganisms and foreign matter.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the compound acted effectively at low concentrations without any harmful influence on host cell mechanisms. They found it to be extremely safe and non-toxic, even at high doses.", "title": "Collecting Eucalyptus, California Wild Sage and Olive leaves", "publishedDate": "2010-07-21T07:20:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_GnF84t-wk", "description": "", "title": "switchfoot- needle and haystack life live bush gardens", "publishedDate": "2010-07-15T21:41:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_Gtax7e-s4", "description": "ThePsychoAdventures - :D", "title": "TPA - \"\u042f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u043f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u0443\u0448\u0430\u044e \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\" [\"Official Soundtrack\"]", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T18:50:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_H-l6kJN74", "description": "Watch this video for a full preview of what's in the Roald Dahl Digikit Collection 2; a set of digikits for use with CraftArtist. \n\nIncludes the following kits:\n- The BFG\n- James and the Giant Peach\n- Danny, the Champion of the World\n- Revolting Rhymes\n- George's Marvellous Medicine\n- Gobblefunk dictionary\n\nAvailable from Create & Craft TV from 8th August 2014.", "title": "Roald Dahl Digikit Collection 2 - available from 8th August!", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T08:55:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_HGyhoZn4E", "description": "Subscribe to the Dr. Phil YouTube Channel: http://bitly.com/SubscribeDrPhil\nLIKE us on Facebook: http://bitly.com/DrPhilFacebook\nFollow us on Twitter: http://bitly.com/DrPhilTwitter\n\nMore information on this episode at: http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/1802/\n\nRobert says his mom, Kathy, calls him and his wife 20 to 30 times a day, and if they don't answer, will leave verbally-abusive voicemails and go to any length to get a response -- and it's ruining their marriage.

I decided to try my own version with Funkytown by Lipps Inc.  I only used computers from the early 1980's that were destined for the Junk Yard and this is how I got the idea for JunkyTown.  I also used a modem but DTMF tones are lousy for musical notes (no harmonics) but I was very lucky to find two notes  that did sound good. On your phone punch in 3 3 2 3 and you got the beginning part of the solo and the rest is history.  Please note no synthesizer or audio effects were used and all the audio was recorded from a microphone or direct line.  Some of the audio was amplified when it was mixed down because the levels were too low ie. the printer and modem.  The Commodore 64 was used for the main Bass and Guitar.  The Ti-99/4A was used for the second part of the solo because of the limitation of DTMF tones.  It was tempting to just sample the modem but I did not in order to keep it 100% original.  It was difficult to video tape the printer because it kept shaking the table so I looped the printer video in the begining of the video.  The printer sometimes caused the harddrive head to shake out of sync so I inserted a screw into the mechinism and this some what helped.  \n90% of the work was put into the audio and very little effort was put into the video and I think this did affect the overall results. \n\nJames Cochrane", "title": "Funkytown by Lipps Inc.

But as the saying goes, a little knowledge can be dangerous thing.\n\nWithout an understanding of foundational Psyche-Type concepts and terminology, people often confuse the meaning of Psyche-Type terms with their meanings in colloquial conversation.\n\nThe one I want to discuss here, is the one born-again Perceivers sometimes like to level at their Judging cousins. Namely, 'I'm a P, I'm not judgemental like you Js.' Aside from the irony of this judgemental edict, the fact is that it has no grounding in science. To be judgemental is to be unnecessarily unkind in one's evaluation of another's behaviour. And you can rest assured, both Js and Ps can be guilty of this. It has nothing to do with the last letter of your Psyche-Type code.\n\nWe all perceive and we all make judgements. In fact, if you look at your Psyche-type code, you'll find that regardless of whether you are a J or a P, you employ two perception functions and two judgement functions. \n\nJ and P are about how we relate to the outside world. Judgers like to make decisions in the outer world; to be goal-oriented and to ensure a particular outcome by planning ahead, whereas perceivers prefer to remain open-ended and to make the most of opportunities when they come along, rather than organising in advance. \n\nThose who think J is for judgemental should also be aware that four perceiving types -- INFP, INTP, ISFP and ISTP -- actually have a dominant judging function, just as four judging types -- INFJ, INTJ, ISFJ and ISTJ -- actually have a dominant perceiving function.\n\nThe take home message: understand the theory before casting your 'judgements' upon others. Js and Ps both have a lot to give and it is precisely their differences that make for excellent partnerships between the two. Perceivers help Judgers by offering up ideas and suggestions, and Judgers help Perceivers by structuring these into goals and plans.\n\nLearn more about Judging and Perceiving, learn Psyche-Type at InterPersonality.com", "title": "J is for Judging, NOT Judgemental", "publishedDate": "2012-02-10T01:49:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_Jst8ACutM", "description": "", "title": "Daiana Vinca - Pe deal vin", "publishedDate": "2013-08-18T20:18:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_K5nLyvijw", "description": "", "title": "Noam Chomsky on Castro, Cuba, Rockefeller, and Jefferson", "publishedDate": "2013-04-06T04:37:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_KKEz6YBh4", "description": "Yonnie's reputation for fast, fun-to-watch skating continues here.

The United Nations and Amnesty International have accused the group of grave human rights abuses.\n\nISIS originated as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999. This group was the forerunner of Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn\u2014commonly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)\u2014a group formed by Abu Musab Al Zarqawi in 2004 which took part in the Iraqi insurgency against American-led forces and their Iraqi allies following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the 2003\u20132011 Iraq War, it joined other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council, which consolidated further into the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) shortly afterwards. At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city. However, the violent attempts by the Islamic State of Iraq to govern its territory led to a backlash from Sunni Iraqis and other insurgent groups in around 2008 which helped to propel the Awakening movement and a temporary decline in the group. In April 2013, the group changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nAs ISIS the group grew significantly under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, gaining support in Iraq as a result of alleged economic and political discrimination against Iraqi Sunnis. After entering the Syrian Civil War, ISIS established a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo. In June 2014, it had at least 4,000 fighters in its ranks in Iraq. It has claimed responsibility for attacks on government and military targets and for attacks that have killed thousands of civilians. In August 2014, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that the number of fighters in the group had increased to 50,000 in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq, while the CIA estimated in September 2014 that in both countries it had between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters. ISIS had close links to al-Qaeda until February 2014 when, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and \"notorious intractability\".\n\nThe group's original aim was to establish an Islamic state in the Sunni-majority regions of Iraq, and following ISIS's involvement in the Syrian Civil War this expanded to include controlling Sunni-majority areas of Syria. A caliphate was proclaimed on 29 June 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2014now known as Amir al-Mu'minin Caliph Ibrahim\u2014was named as its caliph, and the group was renamed the Islamic State.", "title": "ISIS aka ISIL - Terrorist video borrows techniques from Hollywood", "publishedDate": "2014-10-11T18:54:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_jLL20KMbs", "description": "Learn how to identify this invasive species and learn how to deal with it!", "title": "Asiatic Bittersweet", "publishedDate": "2012-06-25T20:23:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_jccw2rDEc", "description": "Ben's new PB Mulloway from Jaxsons Hole in Yalata on SA's Far West Coast. pretty happy chappy", "title": "Ben's 122cm Jaxsons Hole Mulloway", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T07:01:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_jo5sSWWKU", "description": "India News:\n\nUttar Pradesh Police reached a new low today, with one accused dead during torture, and other visual showing UP Policemen dragging a dead body, without any sensitivity.\n\nThis shows the moral levels of Uttar Pradesh Police.", "title": "Uttar Pradesh Police : Heights of Insensitiveness !!!", "publishedDate": "2013-05-19T14:09:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_k5UqoS0eE", "description": "", "title": "PARACENTESIS ULTRASOUND GUIDED", "publishedDate": "2010-11-16T11:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_kCpzMJ1Wo", "description": "Pre-order MCR's limited edition of the greatest hits album \"May Death Never Stop You\" at http://mychemicalromance.com and the regular version at iTunes at http://smarturl.it/mcrgritunes & get \"Fake Your Death\" immediately.\n\n\u00a9 2013 WMG  CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS Number Five is out now: http://smarturl.it/cw5\n\nConnect with My Chemical Romance:\nhttp://MyChemicalRomance.com\nhttp://facebook.com/MyChemicalRomance\nhttp://twitter.com/MCRofficial", "title": "My Chemical Romance - \"Surrender the Night\" [Audio]", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T00:42:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_kuZ0GguXo", "description": "The East Side of Fort Worth is an interesting place.

Television replays suggested it was a harsh decision from the referee.\n\nFrom the subsequent free kick Yaya Toure almost put Ivory Coast ahead, but his curling shot was headed off his own goal line by Aboubakar, who was brilliantly placed to defend the strike.\n\nWith 20 minutes to play Gervinho had another great chance after playing a quick one-two with Salomon Kalou, but the Roma attacker was denied by a brave block from Ondoua.\n\nThe dying minutes of the game saw Ivory Coast just knock the ball around like a training session, with an exhausted Cameroon not applying any pressure and clearly happy to play out a goalless stalemate.", "title": "Ivory Coast players pass between them all extra time vs Cameroon 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T16:01:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_mQSlgNwEM", "description": "http://bit.ly/RSTBF0\n\nWith the explosion in connected devices came an explosion in information.

Set in Baltimore in 1954 at the birth of rock & roll, the film features Johnny Depp as Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker. Depp is pure charisma as a juvenile delinquent with a permanent tear slithering down his cheek, a reminder of his state-executed parents. In the depths of his despair appears goody-goody girl Allison (Amy Locane), who has a sexual crush on Cry-Baby. But Allison's Pat Boone-like boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen E. Miller), the leader of the squares, is dead set against Cry-Baby and the rest of the juvenile delinquents and leads a revolt against them. In the resultant riot, the juvenile delinquents are blamed for the chaos, and Cry-Baby finds himself dispatched to reform school.\n\ncry-baby,\"cry-baby clip\",\"cry-baby trailer\",\"cry-baby part 1\",\"johnny depp\",\"amy locane\",\"stephen mailer\",\"polly bergen\",\"john waters\",\"dress videos\",\"motorcycle videos\",comedy,\"contemporary movie musicals\",\"cult comedies\",\"late night comedies\",musicals,\"spoofs and satire\",\"brian grazer\",\"jim abrahams\",\"rachel talalay\",\"pat moran\",\"attraction videos\",\"chivalry videos\",\"defiance videos\",\"door step videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++11681,/m/0jfx1,/m/096bsx,/m/01p2cbp,/m/08m038", "title": "Cry-Baby (4/10) Movie CLIP - Picking Up Allison (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T09:15:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_nS2GjR3bM", "description": "la ONU recomienda no donar al teleton", "title": "la ONU recomienda no donar al teleton", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T18:12:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_nW0Q1DKHA", "description": "http://www.tweaktown.com In this video we found Shoulin Chua from AMAX Information Technologies who gave us an introduction to one of its GPU Personal Supercomputers.

The first few tests were to just discover it's capabilities.  While they were technically fine, little attention was paid to framing or composition. Daytime time lapses are also trickier with this camera because, in order for a smooth video, you need to drag the shutter.  Doing that in the day lets in a lot of light.  The camera does not have a filter thread to add any ND stops (that I knew of at the time), so I needed to close the iris as far as I could, and even that didn't balance against the added light.  I thought it's strength would be at night, where I could keep the camera wide open while dragging the shutter.  This video was shot with a shutter speed of half a second, with a picture being taken every second.  It was shot in a .CR2 RAW format on a Class 4 Sandisk card.  I think the image interval could have been snappier, because I did notice a slight pause when it was writing the RAW image to a disk.  I'll have to test it using a faster card.\n\nA benefit to this camera that I always have to deal with  using DLSRs is the \"aperture flicker\" that can happen if you happen to have the f-stop anything other than \"wide open\".  This happens because the iris opens and closes for each shot.  I saw none of that when I was shooting my tests.  I had the camera at an f8 and had absolutely no visible strobe.\n\nI am excited to add this camera to my kit.  It is small enough that I can put it on an arm and clamp, mount it virtually anywhere, and it takes up very little room in my gear pack. I see myself setting this up and letting it run while I am able to concentrate on full motion footage with my T2i.  Thus doubling my productivity out in the field.

That's absolutely perfect! Thanks!\" She enthused. I arched my brow at her, ok... she was acting extremely, extremely weird now. \n\n\"Demi... what's up with you?\" I asked, while she placed some crazy glue to the back of the pendant, pressing it down on the empty space of the collage. She shook her head and looked up at me. Her chocolate eyes had a hazy quality to it. She was in a daze.\n\n\"Nothing.\" She replied. \"I'm just waiting...\" She finished off. Wiping her hands on her jeans from the residue of the glue. Waiting? What the hell could she possibly be waiting for?\n\n\"For what?\" I asked, my gaze becoming hard. The only thing she could be waiting for already came home. She doesn't know anyone else. \n\n\"To wake up.\" She dazedly replied. I cocked my head back at her reply, a half smirk, half frown appeared on my open lips. To wake up? And then finally... it hit me! She thought she was asleep? At that moment, a chuckle rolled out of my lips.\n\nShe looked at me, glaring a bit. \"Why are you laughing?\" She asked. I shook my head, chuckling some more. She was serious, wasn't she?\n\n\"Demi, you are awake.\" I told her, my eyes going hard again. She rolled her eyes and shook her head. \n\n\"No I'm not. This all just a dream... a nightmare.\" She proclaimed, whispering the last part. I shook my head, walking closer to her grabbing her wrist.\n\n\"Are you being a smart ass?!\" I questioned, a growl in my voice as I stared down at her with menacing eyes. She shook her head and began chuckling. \n\n\"You're eyes are so... so... yeah.\" She said, not quite finishing her sentence, giggling as she looked around the room. \n\n\"Demi, are you high?\" She shook her head, pausing momentarily, then shrugged.\n\n\"I don't know... I was hungry... so I ate one of your mints that you had in your drawer.\" She admitted. At that point I was beyond confused. Mints? What mints?\n\n\"Demi... I don't have any mints. What the hell are you talking about?\" My patience was thinning, she was insane.\n\n\"Joe, how could you forget about your mints? They're right here...\" She stated, walking up to my drawer and pulling out a bag of- OH MY GOD! She was high!\n\nQuickly walking up to her, I snatched the bag out her hand and grabbed her arm, pulling her close to me. \"Those are not mints you Moron! Those are drugs! You ate a oxycodone pill!\" I yelled, screaming at her with all my might. How could she be such an idiot!?\n\n\"I didn't know... I was hungry. No one feeds me around here!\" She whined, tears rolling down her cheeks onto her blouse. I sighed, shaking my head tiredly. As if I wasn't exhausted enough...\n\n\"Don't go through my drawers and don't touch my shit! If you were hungry, all you had to do was leave the room and make yourself something to eat!\" I proclaimed, my voice still rough and demanding. She nodded, as I eased my grip on her arm and began walking with her out the room. \n\n\"Where are we going?\" She asked. \n\n\"To the kitchen. I'm gonna make you a sandwich and some black coffee to get that shit out your system.\" I explained. She nodded, sniffling as she used her free hand to wipe her tears. I felt Nicole's eyes on us.\n\n\"What's going on?\" She asked, rising up on the couch to view the show. I rolled my eyes at her nosiness... some bitches never learn. \n---\n\nKeep READING! :D :D :D", "title": "Vesper's Goodbye | A Jemi Rated R Story | Chapter 21 (2/3)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-20T04:34:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6_rRVtS8BfA", "description": "", "title": "Keren !!!

The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts. Pharmacognosy is the study of all medicines that are derived from natural sources.The bark of willow trees contains large amounts of salicylic acid, which is the active metabolite of aspirin. Willow bark has been used for millennia as an effective pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\nPlants have the ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions, and to defend against attack from predators such as insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. Many of these phytochemicals have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total.Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side effects.\nThe use of plants as medicines predates written human history. Ethnobotany (the study of traditional human uses of plants) is recognized as an effective way to discover future medicines. In 2001, researchers identified 122 compounds used in modern medicine which were derived from \"ethnomedical\" plant sources; 80% of these have had an ethnomedical use identical or related to the current use of the active elements of the plant.[4] Many of the pharmaceuticals currently available to physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including aspirin, digitalis, quinine, and opium.\nThe use of herbs to treat disease is almost universal among non-industrialized societies, and is often more affordable than purchasing expensive modern pharmaceuticals. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. Studies in the United States and Europe have shown that their use is less common in clinical settings, but has become increasingly more in recent years as scientific evidence about the effectiveness of herbal medicine has become more widely available.\n\nWIN, an acronym for \n\n\"What Is New\" \n\nis a comprehensive multimedia services package for maximum news distribution across several media channels via WIN TV, exclusively dedicated for New Media production and Broadcating", "title": "SEX BOOSTER FROM NATURE-festour", "publishedDate": "2013-02-26T13:54:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6a5PJhkTZj8", "description": "symmachiarii\nEl sardinero", "title": "Incidentes Racing de Santander - Real Oviedo 23/03/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-24T13:25:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6a5_nDxMezs", "description": "EPIC PUMP PRANK part 1 - http://youtu.be/5MvBLOoS1oQ\n\nShout out to the awesome channel RomanAtwood!!

Corynex\u00ae, a breakthrough, patented system overcomes these challenges and allows for the isolation of higher yields of biologically active proteins with accurate folding, increased purity with fewer host proteins and no endotoxins. \n\nThe Corynex\u00ae Expression system secretes proteins, already in active form, directly into media with high initial purity.

A grassroots resistance movement has emerged to fight the introduction of fracking in the UK, and it appears to be gaining momentum throughout the country.\n\nIn the upcoming documentary, VICE News travels to Blackpool, Lancashire, to see the fractivists in action. The seaside resort town is at the center of a David and Goliath battle between local residents and the energy company Cuadrilla over fracking in the region, which is believed to have one of the largest shale gas reserves in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nCheck out \"These Towns and Counties Across America Just Banned Oil and Gas Fracking\" - http://bit.ly/1F3oiwu\n\nWatch \"Showdown in Coal Country\" - http://bit.ly/1wfWtur\n\nCheck out the VICE News beta for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews", "title": "Shale Gas in the UK: What the Frack (Trailer)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T15:10:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "6aE4QG8X9qU", "description": "\"Where The Wild Are\" available on iTunes 7th April 2014\n\nEP \"Southern\" available now on iTunes: http://po.st/SouthernEP\n\nWhere The Wild Are directed by Christophe Rihet\n\nFollow Southern on:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thisissouthern\nhttps://twitter.com/thisissouthern\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thisissouthern\nhttps://instagram.com/thisissouthern\n\nhttp://www.marathonartists.com/", "title": "Southern - Where The Wild Are", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T12:46:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6aEEeLX5pIY", "description": "", "title": "Dubai buildings", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T17:01:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6aEp7ErHXgE", "description": "Music video by Rufus Wainwright performing Sonnet 20.

El brusco flujo de aire dentro de los pulmones causa que la glotis se cierre, produciendo un sonido caracter\u00edstico (Escuchar \u25b6?/i).\nSe define m\u00e1s t\u00e9cnicamente como una serie de contracciones espasm\u00f3dicas, s\u00fabitas, involuntarias e intermitentes de la musculatura inspiratoria, principalmente el diafragma, seguidas de un cierre brusco de la glotis, lo que origina un sonido peculiar y caracter\u00edstico.\nEs un problema generalmente benigno y transitorio, culturalmente gracioso, la mayor\u00eda de las veces sin causa conocida que lo desencadene.\nEl diafragma es un m\u00fasculo que generalmente funciona correctamente. Desciende cuando se inhala para ayudar a llevar aire a los pulmones y sube cuando se exhala para poder expulsar el aire de los pulmones. Sin embargo, a veces el nervio fr\u00e9nico que controla la contracci\u00f3n del diafragma produce est\u00edmulos inadecuados. Cuando esto sucede, el diafragma sube de manera brusca y hace que la respiraci\u00f3n sea anormal, provocando el cierre de la epiglotis y produciendo el hipo.\nAlgunas de las situaciones que producen la contracci\u00f3n espont\u00e1nea del diafragma son: comer demasiado o demasiado r\u00e1pido, trastornos estomacales, abuso de alcohol o ansiedad. Casi todos los casos de hipo duran s\u00f3lo unos minutos. Algunos casos de hipo pueden durar d\u00edas o semanas, pero es poco habitual y normalmente es un signo de otro trastorno m\u00e9dico.\nEl hipo persistente \u2014\u00absingultus\u00bb, en su denominaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica correcta\u2014 es aquel que se presenta en forma de un ataque prolongado o ataques recurrentes durante un tiempo superior a 48 horas. Puede resolverse sin tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico, pero en otras ocasiones es necesario administrarlo y realizar un estudio m\u00e9dico para averiguar su origen. 1 Puede incomodar enormemente a quien lo padece y provocar insomnio, p\u00e9rdida de peso, dehiscencia e infecci\u00f3n de suturas e incluso, bloqueo auriculoventricular. En estos casos puede ser signo de patolog\u00eda severa, por lo que estos pacientes deben ser objeto de una atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica que eval\u00fae las posibles entidades cl\u00ednicas subyacentes.\nCharles Osborne (1 de mayo de 1894, 1991) tuvo hipo continuamente durante 68 a\u00f1os, desde 1922 hasta 1990. Es el hombre con el ataque de hipo m\u00e1s largo que se haya registrado. En 1922, empez\u00f3 con una tasa de 40 hipos por minuto y fue disminuyendo paulatinamente hasta 0 en 1990. Est\u00e1 registrado en el Guinness World Records.\n\nMas informacion en wikipedia y fotografias en http://masfotografias.com", "title": "Serpiente con hipo, seguramente ceno demasiado rapido, jejeje", "publishedDate": "2011-04-06T06:35:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6agIMqRLtno", "description": "http://www.worldmusicsupply.com/MXR-Phase-90-4-Stage-Phaser-Guitar-Pedal.html\n\nJason D.

The Heating is about as warm as a hot tub. Research has shown that heat can damage or kill cancer cells in some tumors while also making radiation and chemotherapy more effective.\n\nWhile it has been known for hundreds of years that fevers can kill cancer, only recently has technology been developed that can control and focus heat specifically on tumors.\n\nLocal hyperthermia treatment (heat applied to a very small area, such as a tumor) is a well-established cancer treatment. Primary malignant tumors have a bad blood circulation, which make them more sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\n\n\"Our own clinical experience and the results of numerous published studies are highly encouraging in that increased use of hyperthermia will improve the quality of life for cancer patients and improve control of cancer recurrences.\"\n\nDr. Gerald Sokol, New Hope Cancer Center, Hudson, FL.\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia is offering our patients new hope. We are often seeing faster responses, better cancer control, and fewer side effects.\"\n\nDr. Leland Rogers, GammaWest, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n\n\"Hyperthermia gives us a method to treat people when there are few other alternatives. It's an additional form of treatment that can be done in difficult cases, usually without serious side effects or complications.\"\n\nDr. Steven Stroup, Centennial Hospital, Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\n\"When the tumor is of larger size, it is unresectable surgically. Also, radiation has less effect on the center part of the tumor, which is deprived of the oxygen blood supply and the nutrients. By increasing the temperature of the tissues from 42-44 degrees centigrade, (hyperthermia) increases the circulation, increases the oxygenation, so that the radiation is more effective.\"\n\nNasir Syed, Long Beach Memorial Center, Long Beach, CA", "title": "News Story About Hyperthermia Cancer Treatment with MRI", "publishedDate": "2007-12-15T12:09:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ahjQnOfu5Y", "description": "Look how adorable Carey Mulligan is when she realises Fitzy and Wippa have real information on her family history to tell her about!\n\nAncestry.com.au released information on the family history of all the cast of The Great Gatsby to see if there were any similarities to the characters of the renowned book and highly anticipated movie.\n\nNova's Fitzy and Wippa took the information along to their interview with Carey Mulligan (who plays Daisy Buchanan) and she was SO into it!\n\nShe was even happy to replicate her great, great, great grandfather by pretending to be a 'lamp holder'.

Many people struggle to understand what exactly VAT is and how it works, but it's extremely important. Over 150 countries use VAT including China and India, and most of Europe. So for global and international businesses it's imperative that you understand VAT. Let's take a look.\n\nOkay, VAT is an indirect tax that is given to the government at every stage of production of an item, in other words, every time there is value added. Let's take an example from the furniture industry. Let's just say that there is a lumber company and they're selling lumber to a furniture maker and they're going to sell it for 50 euros and the VAT rate is 10%. So that means that on 50 euros there would be 5 euros VAT. Now the lumber company is going to give that 5 euros directly to the government, so 5 euros here to the government. The furniture maker buys it for 55 euros and let's say that they're going to sell it to the furniture store, but they're adding value so they charge 120 euros to the furniture store. That's 12 euros VAT. Now, the furniture maker is going to also give VAT to the government because there was value added, but they're not going to give the full 12 because the government already got 5. So they're going to give 12 minus 5 equals 7.\n\nWe'll say that again in case you missed it. The furniture maker sells it to the retail store for 132 euros and the retailer is going to sell it to the consumer and let's say they want to sell it for 150 euros, which would be 15 euros VAT. So the consumer pays 165 euros and the furniture store is going to remit that again, but a total of 12 euros is already paid. So they take the 15 and subtract the 12 coming from here and they're going to remit 3 to the government. So at each stage when value is added VAT is remitted to the government, but if there was an amount of VAT that was previously paid that gets subtracted from how much an entity remits to the government.", "title": "Will's Whiteboard: What is VAT and how does it work?", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T21:15:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ajP7hYtj2k", "description": "Katelijne Damen vertelt over haar favoriete fragment uit Atropa (De wraak van de vrede), van Guy Cassiers en Tom Lanoye.

Note that there is a CODAR (a specialized coastal radar) also on frequency, sweeping through about once per second.

The parent\nargued with the traffic police, but he was beaten.\nThe policeman's behavior caused onlookers' to become\nangry, and a crowd overturned police enforcement vehicles.\n\nThe case triggered the gathering of over\na thousand people, causing traffic jams.\nThe authorities sent a large number of police to clear people,\nand the parents and children were taken away by police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2013\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "Armed Villagers Fight in Guangdong Province", "publishedDate": "2013-02-26T03:46:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ao0qpWtViI", "description": "shingling conveyor fitted to sleeve feeder", "title": "udaFORMAXX c Shingling Conveyor", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T15:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6aoLEV5aTQM", "description": "Every year in September male Steller and Californian sea lions gather to wait for salmon and to practice their jousting skills.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "How To Learn To Speak Hindi The Fast And Easy Way", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T13:45:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bDt6trJmGM", "description": "Window Tidy lets you quickly and easily arrange your application windows on your Desktop onto a customisable grid using nothing but drag and drop!

Learn more at http://www.aciworldwide.com/awards\n\nUnion Bank of India has 3,200 Branches, 3,800 ATMs and 30 million customers.\nRemittances represent a large market and currently 90% of remittances pass through branches. The banks want to be more efficient in how they process these and offer customers the opportunity to interact with them twenty four hours a day.\nBy allowing remittances through their ATMs Union Bank of India have freed their 8 million card holding customers from needing to enter the branch or contact a call center.  This has ensured increased customer loyalty and retention for the bank.\n\n.......\n\n \nLalit: Union Bank of India is a 92-year-old bank, headquartered at Mumbai. We take pride that the foundation stone of this bank was laid by the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi. \n\nWe are a bank with 3,200 branches, 3,800 ATMs. $80 billion business makes, and 30 million+ customers. The domestic remittances in India is valued at about $50 billion US Dollars at the present time; it is growing 15% year-on- year. Interestingly, 90% of these remittances are flowing through banks. There is a tremendous pressure on banks to handle remittances, and each bank wants to be better and efficient on this.\n\nUnion Bank has a well-defined strategy for customer empowerment. We aim at providing solutions to customers 24/7 without the need to visit the branch or call centers. This implementation is in the same direction where we have made available multiple remittance options on ATMs.\n\nWe have almost 8 million card holders in the bank, as against 1 million internet banking customers. It was our natural choice to provide as many services possible on the ATM. That's how the remittance at ATMs took its shape, and we decided that we will offer remittance services on our ATMs 24/7.\n \nAjit: BASE24 is a switching system. It allows money to be switched from the sender to the beneficiary. We have even many transfer faculties, like IMPS, that is Inter-Bank Money Payment System. We have given NEFT services, that is the National Fund Transfer System, and also e-cash.\n \nLalit: My customers are extremely happy at having the freedom of doing remittances on ATMs 24/7. This is a unique facility which no other bank is offering, and we hope this will go a long way in customer retention, and also increasing customer loyalty for the bank.", "title": "Union Bank Allows 8 Million Card Holders ATM Access For Remittance Handling", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T14:50:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bTeTrwtRg0", "description": "Inspect, test, repair, maintain, and service aircraft.", "title": "Airframe and Power Plant Mechanics", "publishedDate": "2009-03-28T15:33:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bThrP6WzHM", "description": "On 14 April we'll celebrate reaching our '100 Days to Go' milestone by revealing some of the key elements of our medal ceremonies.\n\nEach element will demonstrate the very best of creative home grown talent, and showcase to the world a contemporary and stylish Scotland.\n\nIn our first feature, we visit the Outer Hebrides of Scotland to speak to the people who make Harris Tweed such a unique fabric and iconic Scottish brand.\n\nFollow us now on Facebook and Twitter where all will be revealed on the evening of Monday 14 April.\n\nFacebook.com/glasgow2014\nTwitter: @Glasgow2014\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the official Commonwealth Games YouTube channel by clicking the link below http://bit.ly/1lsrARK \n\nDon't miss your chance to experience this venue in person, buy tickets now: https://tickets.glasgow2014.com/", "title": "True Scotland: Harris Tweed  | Behind the Games", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T12:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bTrAMQfAxE", "description": "A quick outfit video featuring my favourite new two piece,Enjoy :)\n\n------------------------------\u00ad------------------------------\u00ad--\nLINKS MENTIONED:\n\nONE-BOUTIQUE: http://one-boutique.co.uk\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMY LINKS\nMY BLOG: http://bit.ly/144EwUe\nMY SHOP: http://bit.ly/1exd9aw\nMY DEPOP: thisiswhatido\nMY TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1c6N4P8\nINSTAGRAM: Katethisiswhatido\nTUMBLR: http://bit.ly/1dytPkH \n------------------------------\u00ad------------------------------\u00ad---------------------------\nMUSIC USED\nQUANTEYES - TRAP'D FEELS\n( soundcloud ) licensed under a creative commons act\nhttps://soundcloud.com/quanteyes/trapd-feels-quanteyes-final", "title": "OOTD: Floral Two Piece", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T17:45:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bTsQC0zDIc", "description": "This is a short video on how to adjust the carburetor on a chrysler outboard.\nThis cover's Chrysler and Sea King outboard's 4.4-15hp", "title": "Chrysler 9.9hp outboard motor carburetor adjust how to", "publishedDate": "2012-05-16T14:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bURf8yGzss", "description": "Subscribe to truTV for more! http://bit.ly/1db6UsP\n\nBernice encounters a group of rowdy co-eds who have too much alcohol and not enough class.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1cQL3bD @trutv\nLike us on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/16fheMx", "title": "South Beach Tow - Sorority Girls Get Feisty", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T14:43:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bUZ83hbYfk", "description": "", "title": "Beroe - CSKA 1-2", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T22:39:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bUa7ZFOP98", "description": "Lublin, Zalew Zemborzycki 23.03.2014", "title": "\u0141yska zwyczajna (Fulica atra) i krzy\u017c\u00f3wka", "publishedDate": "2014-03-23T14:09:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bUbp1DayFo", "description": "Man\u00e8ge \"Le Vampire\" du parc de man\u00e8ges La Ronde \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al film\u00e9 avec une cam\u00e9ra GoPro HD :)", "title": "Le Vampire \u00e0 La Ronde", "publishedDate": "2011-08-17T00:47:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bUmmt6j7rA", "description": "A tattletale commercial unit gets blown up and it still calls the police.\n\nhttp://www.tattletale.com/", "title": "Bomb Squad Still Can't Beat a tattletale", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T15:03:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6bUt7x0A36U", "description": "SOURCEFED SHIRTS!!! http://dft.ba/-4EpA\nLook, frankly speaking, all of the information you need on this is in the title.

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

Here I found that when there is no connection between the transmitter and receiver, the receiver still outputs a signal on all channels. However, the switch (channel 5) that I am using in the video outputs 2000ms when ON, 1000ms when OFF and 1500ms when there is no signal, so I am able to use this to know whether or not a connection is established between the transmitter and receiver. When there is no connection, I set the ESC output to 0, disarming them which causes the beeping sound.
