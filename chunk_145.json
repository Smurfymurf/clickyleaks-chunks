Ian Holloway says \"it's only a touchline ban\" and his players can \"hardly hear him stood there anyway\".\n\nCrystal Palace manager Ian Holloway will serve a two-match touchline ban after the Football Association confirmed he would not appeal the sanctions handed out following the Eagles' 1-0 defeat to Tottenham.\n\nHolloway was charged with two separate counts after Roberto Soldado's penalty condemned his side to defeat on the opening weekend of the Barclays Premier League season.\n\nAnd the FA has now announced he has decided not to contest the charges.\n\n\"Ian Holloway will serve a two-match touchline suspension with immediate effect after Crystal Palace notified The FA that they would not be appealing the sanction,\" a statement on its website read.\n\n\"Holloway was given the ban along with an \u00a318,000 fine after he admitted two separate charges, both in relation to his side's game against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday 18 August 2013.\n\n\"Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Wednesday 28 August 2013, the following results were reached.\n\n\"In relation to a breach of FA Rule E3 in that Holloway's language and/or behaviour in or around the match officials' changing room after the game amounted to improper conduct, he was given a two-match touchline ban to commence with immediate effect and fined \u00a310,000.\n\n\"In relation to a breach of FA Rule E3 in that Holloway's post-match comments constituted improper conduct in that they questioned the integrity of the match referee and/or match officials in general, and/or implied that the match referee and/or match officials in general were motivated by bias; and/or brought the game into disrepute, Holloway was fined \u00a38,000.\n\n\"The sanctions were stayed to allow Holloway the opportunity to lodge an appeal having considered the written reasons. The FA were notified on Tuesday 3 September that he would not be appealing, therefore his touchline ban commences with immediate effect.\"\n\nAmong many post-match comments relating to the performance of the officials, Holloway said: 'It's going to be a long hard season for me with these people. I had this with Blackpool. Certain clubs get fouls and others don't. I just want a bit of fairness.\"\n\nHe will now be banned from the touchline for the trip to champions Manchester United on September 14 and the following weekend's home clash with Swansea.\n\nThe FA also confirmed that Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies has also been charged following their 2-1 defeat at Wigan on August 31.\n\n\"The charge is in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E3 in that his language and/or behaviour at the end of the match amounted to improper conduct. Davies has until 6pm on 6 September 2013 to reply to the charge,\" a brief statement read.", "title": "Palace manager Ian Holloway reflects on touchline ban - Manchester United vs Crystal Palace", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T17:52:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "88Z3oQHDMMA", "description": "2 Corinthians 4:\n1Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;\n 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.\n 3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:\n 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.\n 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.\n 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.", "title": "Bible Reading 2 Corinthians 4", "publishedDate": "2014-06-24T01:34:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "88Z9svixREI", "description": "CSO\u8a66\u5408\n2011/05/06\u306b\u3084\u3063\u305f1\u8a66\u5408\u3060\u3051\u3067\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u304c\u4f5c\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f`", "title": "\u3067\u3059\u3080\u30fc\u3073\u30fc", "publishedDate": "2011-05-07T10:29:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "88_1F7dA_xg", "description": "Brian Sykes of Potomac Field Gear (PFG) demonstrates the PFG Advanced Combat Shirt Gen.

The Arboretum is just a short drive from the center of Washington, D.C. Yet visitors often feel like they are far from the busy city. \n\nSam Augusta brought his one-year-old son to play by the water.\n\nSAM AUGUSTA: We like to come and take a look at the fish, and the lotus flowers and a lot of the plants. Hes never seen the fish up close like this before.\n\nJoan Love often visits the Arboretum. She says she knows about almost every plant here.\n\nJOAN LOVE: I mean theres so much to see here and so much to do here. But one thing is, you dont even know youre in Washington, D.C. Youre just here  in all this wonderfulness.\n\nThe Arboretum also is home to what were once pieces of the United States Capitol. These sandstone columns formerly stood at the eastern entrance to the building. They were given to the Arboretum when the Capitol was repaired in 1958. \n\nThomas Elias served as director of the Arboretum for 16 years. \n\nTHOMAS ELIAS: The National Arboretum was established in 1927 by an act of Congress as a research and educational facility, devoted to studying plants, and disseminating information to the American public.\n\nEach year, the Arboretum sends scientists to collect plants from around the world. Those plants are brought back to Washington and planted. Some are used to study ways to grow plants with resistance to insects or disease. \nThe Arboretum also has an area with plants that can be used to make fuels.\n\nTHOMAS ELIAS: Its to demonstrate to people and show people what the plants that can be used to generate bio-fuel or ethanol as a substitute for fuel. So we selected 21 different plants that can be used in some way to generate fuel.\n\nThe bio-fuel display has plants like alfalfa, sunflowers and soybeans. The Arboretum has many areas of interest. But what most visitors say they like best is the calm and natural beauty. Here, they feel far from Washington and the world of politics.

However, since the passage of medical and recreational marijuana in Colorado, cannabis consumption methods have evolved rapidly and the popularity of concentrated hash oil products has surged.\u00a0\n\nCannabis extraction is a method to derive THC, cannabinoid and terpene concentrates from raw plant matter to produce a hash or oil, which delivers marijuana consumers a stronger dosage than smoking the traditional bud.\n\nThe most common methods of extraction use ice water, butane (a petroleum-bsed product) or CO2 (a naturally occurring gas).\n\nWe believe CO2 extraction methods, as used by the Hummingbird Brand Hash Oil, is the cleanest and purest form of marijuana extraction. The resulting purity of the product and the delicious taste, makes CO2 hash oil the preferred choice for medical and recreational marijuana growers and users.\u00a0\n\nTo make hash oil using CO2, the naturally occurring gas is cooled into a liquid and pushed through an tube extracting the psychoactive and medicinal elements from the marijuana plant. The resulting product is then cooled, allowing the CO2 to evaporate away. The finished CO2 hash oil appears as a honey- or molasses-like substance ready to be loaded into a rig, inserted into a vaporizer pen, or spread onto a joint to get that extra lift for the experienced marijuana consumer.\u00a0\n\nHummingbird Brand Hash Oil is 100% pure and uncut raw hash oil. There are no residual solvents nor additives left over in our signature batches.\u00a0\n\nInterested in getting your hands on Colorado's most highly sought-after marijuana hash oil? Then come on down to the The Farm in Boulder, CO, or check us out on our website\u00a0http://thefarmco.com/\u00a0 and come experience for yourself what Colorado marjiuana enthusiasts' say is one of their top choices for cannabis consumption \u2014 Humming Brand Hash Oil.", "title": "Hummingbird Brand Hash Oil made by CO2 Extraction", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T20:46:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "88nOw2jQhMA", "description": "Red wheaten female, black nose and dark eyes.

Nasadiya Sukta expresses doubts if we would ever be able to solve the mystery of creationism. It expresses \"perhaps even He knows not the truth (verse 7)\", the quest will be on. \nBut what is really interesting is the convergence of thoughts of Rig Vedic rishis and modern scientist in this quest, despite adopting radically different methodologies and despite being separated by a time span of 10,000 years. \nHow wonderful is this religious hymn that proclaims the God exists within all, and that the seed of desire is the first bond created to disturb tranquility .. are scientists listening ? - is it time to include more factors to the theory of matter and energy ....another state of intelligence that causes disturbance?\n\nThe poetic description of creation is amazing.

Stenotaphrum w\u00e4chst mit h\u00fcbschen, flachen oder zusammengerollten Bl\u00e4ttern.\n\nStenotaphrum secundatum \"Variegatum\" wird in Wohnungen kultiviert. Die aparten Grashalme wirken in Gruppen zusammen mit dunkelgr\u00fcnen Blattpflanzen besonders gut. Auch in Blumenampeln kommen die Stenotaphrum sehr sch\u00f6n zur Geltung.\n\nDie kriechend wachsenden, flachgedr\u00fcckten Grashalme bilden an den Stellen Wurzeln, wo die verdickten Blattknoten mit dem Pflanzsubstrat in Ber\u00fchrung kommen. An diesen stellen meist mehrere helle, cremefarbene Bl\u00e4tter, die mit d\u00fcnnen, gr\u00fcnen Linien gezeichnet und zum Teil auch gr\u00fcn ger\u00e4ndert sind. Die Bl\u00e4tter einer Stenotaphrum wachsen in L\u00e4ngen von 5 bis 30 cm. Sie sind \u00fcber ihre gesamte L\u00e4nge gleich breit und an der Spitze abgerundet. Einige Bl\u00e4tter verlieren im Laufe der Zeit ihre F\u00e4rbung und sterben dann ab. Sie lassen sich leicht abl\u00f6sen, die Pflanze wird dabei nicht besch\u00e4digt. Die unscheinbaren Bl\u00fcten bilden sich in Wohnungskulturhaltung nur selten oder gar nicht.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Stenotaphrum\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Stenotaphrum wird an einem hellen Standort kultiviert. Die Pflanze ben\u00f6tigt t\u00e4glich einige Stunden direkte Sonnenbestrahlung, ansonsten verblassen die Bl\u00e4tter, verlieren ihre Kontrastf\u00e4rbung und vergr\u00fcnen. Bei sehr guten Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen bekommen manche Bl\u00e4tter einen leichten lilafarbenen Schimmer.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nW\u00e4hrend der Wachstumsperiode w\u00e4ssert man die Stenotaphrum reichlich, der Topfballen sollte immer etwas feucht sein und darf nicht abtrocknen.\n\nIn der Ruheperiode wird die Pflanze sparsamer gew\u00e4ssert, vor der jeweils n\u00e4chsten Wassergabe l\u00e4sst man den Topfballen gut zur H\u00e4lfte abtrocknen\nTemperatur\n\nDie Pflanzen wachsen sehr schnell bei normalen Raumtemperaturen. Temperaturen unter 12 \u00b0 C werden von der Stenotaphrum aber nicht vertragen. Eine erh\u00f6hte Luftfeuchtigkeit verhindert ein fr\u00fchzeitiges Vergilben und Absterben der Bl\u00e4tter, die T\u00f6pfe sollten deshalb auf mit Wasser und Steinen gef\u00fcllte Untersetzer gestellt werden. Ist dies nicht m\u00f6glich, so kann man die  Stenotaphrum  einmal t\u00e4glich mit zimmerwarmem, kalkfreiem Wasser bespr\u00fchen.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nStenotaphrum l\u00e4sst sich am einfachsten durch Teilung des Wurzelstocks vermehren. Man nimmt die Pflanze aus dem Topf und zerschneidet den Wurzelballen mit einem Messer senkrecht in mehrere Teile. Das verfilzte, zusammenh\u00e4ngende Wurzelgeflecht kann man mit den Fingern vorsichtig auseinanderziehen. Nun entfernt man vorsichtig eventuell abgestorbene Wurzelf\u00e4den und setzt die Pflanzen in B\u00fcscheln zu 3 bis 5 Pflanzen in die neuen Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00dfe.\nErde / Substrat\n\nF\u00fcr Stenotaphrum nimmt man handels\u00fcbliche Blumenerde auf Kompostbasis. Auch eine Mischung zu gleichen Teilen aus Torf und Komposterde eignet sich f\u00fcr die Pflanzen hervorragend.\nUmtopfen\n\nDie Pflanzen k\u00f6nnen bei Bedarf mehrmals im Jahr umgetopft werden. Sobald die Grashalme die gesamte Topfoberfl\u00e4che bedecken, kann man die Pflanzen in gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gef\u00e4\u00dfe umtopfen. Junge Exemplare sind h\u00fcbscher als \u00e4ltere Pflanzen. Nach zwei bis drei Jahren sollte man die alten Exemplare durch Nachzucht ersetzen.\nD\u00fcngen / N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf\n\nIn der Hauptwachstumszeit d\u00fcngt man alle 3 bis 4 Wochen mit einem Fl\u00fcssigd\u00fcnger in m\u00e4\u00dfiger Konzentration. Wenn man die Pflanzen zu oft oder zu kr\u00e4ftig d\u00fcngt, werden die Bl\u00e4tter der Stenotaphrum unnat\u00fcrlich gro\u00df und schlaff.", "title": "Stenotaphrum secundatum", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T22:55:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "89Dr0Anvsdg", "description": "Samot\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 v\u010delka z p\u00edskovny Srn\u00ed.", "title": "Coletes cunicularius hedv\u00e1bnice hrabav\u00e1", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T03:35:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "89DtqL2pNAE", "description": "First Link http://www.wintechmobiles.com/tools/zte-unlock-code-calculator/\n\nSecond Link http://www.wintechmobiles.com/tools/zte-blade-code-calculator/\n\nHow to Unlock - Sim free ZTE Blade III (3).

Lately, I've been devoting way too much time to learning (with meticulousness) the awesome Gregory Brothers' Auto-Tune the News episodes note-for-note on my 3-stringed fretless Tsugaru shamisen. In doing so, I got inspired by the implications of what they were doing: extrapolating melodies from the natural pitch arch of the auto-tuned character's speech, and then composing around these many times awkward (but awesome, of course) rhythms and melodies. They probably preserve many of the natural originally spoken rhythms, too, even though everything is quantized. What I thought, though, was what if I did the same thing without quantizing the speaker so that the rhythms of their speech were allowed to be irregular and fall outside of the bar lines? What if I wrote a melody that, as much as possible, matched and accentuated the natural \"melody\" of the speech?!

I could see the track,\n   which had been made by the feet of many generations, winding up the\n   mountain, and I could see where it was lost in the lowering cloud. The\n   cloud itself was bright and radiant. It concealed, and yet it was\n   luminous. It had its deep secrets, and yet it was lucent. It was a home\n   of light, and yet it acted as a veil. The summit of the mountain was\n   hid, but the minister of concealment was also a minister of grace and\n   glory.\n\n   And there are bright clouds which often overshadowed the lives of the\n   devoted friends of the Lord Jesus Christ. Secrets are hid from our\n   gaze. We cannot trace even the outlines of our Father's will. Meanings\n   are shrouded in mystery, but in the very mystery there is a certain\n   radiance. The Presence that is hid is shining. The secrets are love\n   secrets. The veil is there, but within the veil is the home of God.\n\n   The atonement itself is a bright cloud. The ordinary roads are lost in\n   the vast mystery, and the mountain peaks are hid, but the cloud is not\n   black and cold and chilling; it is warm and radiant with eternal love.\n   The Lord is within the cloud, in the unfathomable wonders of perpetual\n   sacrifice. Our understandings are not yet finally enlightened, but the\n   heart is kindled and sustained. We can rest in the Lord and wait\n   patiently for Him. When the veil is lifted we shall see \"Jesus only.\"\n\n   And in Christ Jesus even death itself is a bright cloud. It is a great\n   mystery, but it is lit up from within. The fitting symbol of a\n   Christian's death is not midnight but dawn; not blackness but greyness,\n   for greyness is just blackness made luminous with an indwelling\n   whiteness. Within the mystery of death the Sun of Righteousness is\n   arisen and there is healing in His radiant wings. The veil has not yet\n   been lifted; but death is like a house in the night-time, whose shades\n   are drawn, and whose door is closed, but whose windows are bright with\n   the comforting cheer of fire and light within. Our Lord is in the house\n   and the mystery is radiant.\n\n   And so it is with many other mysteries which confront us in life's way.\n   In Christ Jesus there are bright clouds. To-morrow is one of them. Yes,\n   and when we look back, yesterday is another of them. We need not fear\n   to enter the cloud. The transfigured Saviour is within. It is the\n   dwelling-place of the Lord.", "title": "The Bright Cloud", "publishedDate": "2014-07-01T04:30:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "89RTmU1zOls", "description": "Alianza Lima Noticias: www.clubalianzalima.tv", "title": "As\u00ed se vivi\u00f3 en el camerino \u00edntimo, tras vencer al  cl\u00e1sico rival", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T15:06:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "89RVTzRo8kk", "description": "My first!", "title": "Crotalus adamanteus", "publishedDate": "2009-03-30T19:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "89RdMTitggc", "description": "Nasreddin was a Seljuq satirical Sufi, believed to have lived and died during the 13th century in Ak\u015fehir, near Konya, a capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, in today's Turkey.

Design of a powerful LED includes a semiconducting crystal on a silicon substrate which is installed onto aluminium heat-sink base.Gold-plated jumpers connect the crystal with external package stiff leads - anode and cathode. The design has a solid plastic top.An important stage in creating powerful LEDs is their initial preparation, i.e. crystal growing, planar treatment of design films, their etching, making of contacts, and metal film covers for contact leads. A film grown on one substrate can be cut into several thousand chips. The next stage is to assemble LEDs from these chips.So it is necessary to install the crystal into a package, make terminal leads, and produce optical coatings.As for white LEDs it is necessary to apply luminophore evenly. Then you have to ensure heat removal from the crystal and package and make a solid plastic top which will focus radiation into required space angle.Increased LED's light flux capacity lead to increased waste heat removal efficiency. This requires maximum contact between the chip and heat-removing base.For instance, design of a powerful LED by LUMILEDS LIGHTING ensures efficient heat removal from the crystal as it is mounted directly onto a common substrate which acts as a heatsink and is made of metal. A powerful LED can work for dozens of years at a mild heating of the crystal during current flow.Please remember that supply current of a powerful LED can reach 1000 mA, at voltage from 3 to 4.5 V. In this case LEDs have to be installed onto additional heatsinks. However, such bright LEDs can be also used in small-size lamps and lanterns. Regular or storage battery power supply will suffice. In this case, increasing invertors are not necessary.", "title": "Design of powerful LEDs", "publishedDate": "2011-05-01T23:13:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "89T-TAdPKKY", "description": "", "title": "Oregon vs. Michigan State Highlights | LIVE 9-6-14", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T09:07:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "89T0aRCIw-4", "description": "The Rumble 2012 - Jon Stewart and Fox News host Bill O'Reilly debate", "title": "Bill O'Reilly on public discourse in America", "publishedDate": "2012-10-08T19:20:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "89T3OTC_hT0", "description": "Check out Mondo's new hit show Deep Space 69: http://bit.ly/UcDcJt\nCheck out the DICK FIGURES: THE MOVIE kickstarter page for updates and to learn how to donate! - http://kck.st/L9tNNA\n\nHey guys and gals... we're almost halfway there! $120,000 already!

The sparseness of your arrangement (and your processing of the effects track) allows the effects to be really audible whilst the music weaves nicely in between them.  I like the way you occasionally allow notes to peek out with extra volume as when Kate peers over the handrail on the stairs, and your little high violin figure which appears sporadically certainly adds to the suspense of the scene very nicely indeed.\nI'm not sure I agree with your decision to drop out the music entirely during the shot of Robert waking up.  I feel he needs to be 'involved' in the scene here and also the audience should be kept aware that Kate's suspenseful adventures are continuing downstairs.\nThe music returns as we see Kate about to enter the too downstairs, and then throughout the next sequence of intercutting between Kate and the ghost the music is particularly effective in describing their relationship which shows a sort of sympathy, understanding and acceptance of each other.\nThe music fades gently with the image of the ghost and we are brought back to reality with just the sound of the clock ticking and then Robert's appearance.\nThis is an unusual way to score the scene, but as you say, you used your instincts ab=nd they proved very effective indeed.\nI hope you have enjoyed the course and found it useful - and I wish you the best of luck as you take your scoring career onwards!\n\nDavid Hentschel", "title": "Nithipong_LFTF_M18", "publishedDate": "2013-09-19T09:42:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "89fnxC3GaGw", "description": "Solidago schoffelen met de Gercon schoffelmachine van 'van Gerven Mechanisatie'.\nSchoffelen wordt gedaan voor onkruidbestrijding en om zuurstof in de grond te krijgen.

Some people abuse glitches like the snow glitch in cs_office, and some servers ban props that can get there.\n\nProp hunt has been a very famous gamemode and has spread to other games like Minecraft's Block hunt/Hide and seek.\"\n\nCheck out our free game! \u25bc \n\nApple iOS http://t.co/1SXu4VU8HM\nGooglePlay: http://bit.ly/IwMMWA \nAmazon: http://amzn.to/1jSWZsz\n\nWant some gear? \nUS Store: http://seananners.spreadshirt.com\nEU Store: http://seananners.spreadshirt.net\nUK Store: http://seananners-uk.spreadshirt.co.uk\n\nChilled: https://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\nSark: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMrSark\nAaron: https://www.youtube.com/user/ItsUncleSlam\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/seananno", "title": "FEAR THE ORANGE (Garry's Mod Prop Hunt)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T17:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "89kTcx0T33w", "description": "Aiden Byrne traveled to Bessy Beck trout farm in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria to fish for fresh rainbow trout.

By injection of neuroleptics and tranquilizers during long time it is possible to undermine health and lead a sacrifice to distrophy and death. After this fascism by medical poisoning of Anna Matskevich , she can't  move as she did one month ago. Maybe modern jews have forgotten Hitler's time ,when a lot of jewish people were put in concentrated camps , where nazis used them for different kind of experiments .\nAnna Matskevich just wants to be released from these inhuman barbarian experimnets  on the personality , dignity , health.\nThe application against  lawlessness of police together with paid liers ,participated in the fabrications against Anna Matskevich was sent to the investigative Committee of the Russian Federation and to the Office of Moscow city government. Ofcourse it is all the same to them - they just forward all claims to responsible for legal bureaucratic failure structures of Ministry of internal Affairs or to police structures.Non-governmental Human rights organizations are afraid to interefere in the break of human rights on territory of Russian Federation , because only organization appointed by President of Russia for \"control\" of human rights can decide about existance of rough human right's break...\n\nAt the moment the world is approaching to final maybe collapse between East and West. So nobody will be worried about the fate of the people repressed just for  video records on moscow streets.\nBy neuroleptic's injection with simmulteneous sleep limitization and physicall exaust through staff demands to move all day along corridors it is possible to turn a human into animal by erasing personality.This is real fascistic system of health undermine. In night time the staff makes noise and provokes by shouting interrupting normal sleep.\n\nAnna Matskevich as a person ( a human) is the same as ordinary people , who just like to make video records on streets of big cities.  Russia's state mentality (state machine) does all best to prevent any expressions of oppinion and individuality , especially when it is in english language... The crowd maybe just feels some threat through video reflection of societi's citzen life , behaviour and traditions inside the country. Therefore there is a lot of \"opportunities\" to construct different accusations and fabrications.  As you know Anna Matskevich just every day goes for in sport for some training in style of chienese gymnastik ,  what  maybe by ideological or religian reasons cause anger of some men and women , who express agressity , start to fight or just call police , because for Russia it is up normal when a woman (non of Kremling establishment) so impudently makes sport training in the forest on frost , without their permission....... ! After detaining and blowing by very right policemen  ,the offender will be sent by them to psychatric hospital with a lot of stories and reports about her inadiquate behaviour. In the psychiatry hospital after \"arriving\" the \"offender\" immediately will get strong injection of neroleptics , and 3-4 days later will be brought to so called \"court\" inside the clinic without any opportunity to speak on the hearing without neuroleptics (Haloperidol) in blood . By this way  court makes standart decision standartly against Anna.  \n\nP.S. Last time Anna was detained by police on 06.05.2013 at the moment  of start of anti-Putin's action on \"Bolotnaya\" square. She did'nt participate in the action, but also was sent to psychatric clinic.\n\n\nP,S,\n\nOn 15-th August 2014 my wife Anna Matskevich was attacked in moscow district Kuzminky by hooligans , who blocked her in post office and called police , which also blowed Anna and forwarded her to the psychiatric clinic with lie accusations. On 19-th August she was brough to so called court hearing under strong psychotropic medicals. My opposing that the staff of the clinic used strong psychotropic medicals before the hearing and that Anna is in the clinic by fabrications by paid liers were ignored by the Judge from local moscow \"Lyublinsky\" court Mr. Matlachov A.S. , who made decision for forcible treatment of Anna Matskevich in the psychiatry clinic. I visited Anna next day after hearing : she informed me , that it is forbidden for her even to move inside the room ,were she is isolated. It is also vey limited for her just to wash her face , she does not get back her glases , inspite her dioptry is - 8 ! A contacted to her doctor to Mrs. Sevryukova T.A. and pointed on those things asked not to break Anna's human rights on minimym civilization.On 21-st August I contacted to Deputy chief doctor Mr. Fedin E.Y. He did'nt advice me to make cassation appeal against Anna's psychiatry imprisonment and allowed only she sign the cassation appeal.\n\nThe Moscow psychiatry clinic \u2116 13 in soviet time was an instrument of KGB against dissidents.

Les bronches se divisent en voies plus petites, les bronchioles, puis en petits sacs fragiles en forme de grappe, les alv\u00e9oles. Les alv\u00e9oles sont le si\u00e8ge de l'\u00e9change entre l'oxyg\u00e8ne et le dioxyde de carbone dans le sang.\n\nLa bronchiectasie est une destruction et un \u00e9largissement anormaux des bronches dus \u00e0 une inflammation ou une infection chronique. Les voies a\u00e9riennes pr\u00e9sentent alors un \u00e9largissement anormal. Un exc\u00e8s de mucus se forme et s'amasse dans les voies a\u00e9riennes \u00e9largies. Les petits poils qui tapissent les voies respiratoires, les cils, peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre endommag\u00e9s, ce qui affecte la capacit\u00e9 du patient \u00e0 d\u00e9barrasser les poumons de la poussi\u00e8re et des germes. Du fait du dysfonctionnement des cils, le mucus amass\u00e9 est difficile \u00e0 \u00e9liminer. Les infections pulmonaires sont fr\u00e9quentes.\n\nLa bronchectasie peut \u00eatre cong\u00e9nitale ou secondaire \u00e0 des pathologies pulmonaires. Le principal sympt\u00f4me de la bronchectasie est une toux continue produisant une quantit\u00e9 importante de phlegme et de mucus.

Whether this is true or not, the eyes are one of the things that we look more in others and we hope that others will notice in us. Not considering diopters and visual defects that you may have, a useful and important accessory as the glasses are the best way to give proper emphasis to this aspect of our anatomy, they are able to point out in the right way the shape of an eye, enhance the color, but, in an era when there are other corrective methods, it is clear that they are also one of the possible expressions of our personality, perhaps even more than handbags or shoes.\n\n\nThe best videos, the most exclusive moments of the international runway since 1982 until now, of the most representative fashion weeks of the world.

We believe that the use of chemicals in our Earth's agricultural soils will continue to lead us to disease.\n\nFrom under a microscope over 20 years ago, our PhD's verified that the continued use of these chemicals would one day lead to a decline in crop yields and an increase in soil disease. The same beautifully designed chemicals which protect our plants today would one day make our soils sterile and solidify our dependence on them. We believe that chemical agriculture is the direct opposite of Sustainable Agriculture.\n\nIn the early 90's our group witnessed the struggles of the developing Certified Organic industry. We watched as brave Organic farmers searched to find natural alternatives within an industry that did not embrace them. It was in those moments that our team of, accredited and respected microbiologists decided to take the path less traveled and lend them a helping hand.\n\nOver twenty years of research later and after thousands of trials and errors Dr Frank McKenna finally cracked the code with a product he calls SC27 PLUS. NOW in 2014 there is finally a natural, safe and effective product to help rebuild our Earth's agricultural soils. An easy to use soil inoculant designed to address sustainability in one complete package. After extensive university testing we believe that SC27 PLUS can and will take us into the future by dramatically and rapidly improving our soils natural capabilities to function better that we could have ever imagined possible. We believe that the time to return balance and health to our soils is NOW.\n\nTo get a feel for our work please visit SEPIXA.com.

Nicknamed the 'Black Bomber' on account of the Ford Model T-style paint choice, it was the first volume-produced motorcycle powered by a DOHC engine. And it still looks good today.\n\nAustralian Cliff Overton fell under the spell of the CB450 a couple of years ago. Out of the blue, he got the chance to own one\u2014and jumped at it. \"I wasn't looking for a project, but this bike found me,\" he says. \"A guy at a swap meet said he'd found an old bike lying in a field in Colorado, USA. He was over there hunting for old pick up trucks to bring back to Australia.\"\n\nFast-forward six months, and the CB450 K0 arrived at Cliff's house after a long sea journey with said pick up trucks. And Cliff realized he had a big job on his hands. \"I've played with bikes before, but only as far as a few bits around the edges,\" he admits. \"Never got inside an engine before\u2014so this was a bit daunting!\"\n\nBravely, Cliff got stuck in and pulled the engine apart. He got the head and cases bead-blasted and vibra-polished back to as-new condition, and decided that this was going to be what he calls a 'resto-rod' project. \"I liked the look of the Black Bomber and wanted to make a bike that Honda could have made in the late 60s if they wanted to market a caf\u00e9 racer special.\"\n\nThe tank is from a later K1 (\"I like this tank better than the K0 tank\") and the seat is from Roc-City Cafe Racers, trimmed to fit. The rearsets are from Dime City Cycles, and the sporty little exhausts are actually late 60s aftermarket new-old-stock for the CB450\u2014a real eBay find.\n\n\"The hardest part to get was the original headlamp and gauge set,\" Cliff recalls. \"I wanted one from the start, because it's one of the 'hero' parts that tells folks that this is a Black Bomber.\"\n\nPerformance mods? None so far. \"The engine runs stock 'second oversize' pistons and rings, and apart from the exhaust and pods, it's all stock CB450. But I'll probably swap the cranky, 47-year-old carbs out for a nice set of Mikuni VMs soon.\"\n\nThe electrics were a big challenge. Cliff decided to build a brand new wiring harness from scratch, which he unusually describes as \"fun.\" Every electrical component on the bike is new, apart from the starter motor innards and the stator. The bike is running Dyna coils, a PAMCO electronic ignition and a tiny Antigravity 8-Cell Lithium Ion battery under the seat. The paint scheme is dead stock Black Bomber\u2014even down to the chrome front and rear fenders being stripped back and painted silver.\n\n\"Total project time was around 20 months,\" Cliff reckons. \"I did most of this work in my small garden shed, and some of the finishing off was done by a pro bike builder here in Melbourne.\"\n\nCliff's decided to call his CB450 the 'Runcible Racer.' \"It comes from a caf\u00e9 I saw called The Runcible Spoon,\" he says.", "title": "Custom Honda CB450 Cafe Racer", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T15:56:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "8AcV97bLSxg", "description": "", "title": "moulay bousselham hss1", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T17:34:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Acu3XSGsjM", "description": "Water leaking under windshield cowl seal can flood into engine causing hydro lock.

With a team of staff who have a wealth of knowledge in this field Gabriel has found the perfect base in which to train and prepare for his dream of competing at a serious level.\nIf you share the same ambitions or just want somewhere that has a great atmosphere and all the equipment you need then please feel free to contact us here at City Gym Glasgow where we will be happy to welcome you to your 2nd home.\n\nWeb : http://citygymglasgow.co.uk/\nEmail : info@citygymglasgow.co.uk\nFB : https://www.facebook.com/citygymglasgow\nPhone : 0141 649 9627  \n\nFilmed / Edited\nhttps://twitter.com/GymFanaticFilms", "title": "City Gym Glasgow - Reach Your Training Potential", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T10:21:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8AfOxhNmIYI", "description": "Mitch Park Tour \u2022 Edmond, OK  -YMCA of Greater Oklahoma City. Take a tour of the new YMCA Mitch Park location in Edmond, Oklahoma. The GRAND OPENING is set for Febreuary 3, 2014. \n\nThe YMCA of Greater Oklahoma City announces the official grand opening of the new Mitch\u2008Park Y, which will take place on  Feb. 3. \n\n At 103,000 square feet, the Mitch\u2008Park Y is the largest full service Y in the metro to date.  Offering state of the art work out equipment, an Olympic sized pool, a traditional pool for swim lessons and lap swimming and an indoor track, the Mitch Park Y was built to serve the community of Edmond.\n\n \"The partnership with the city of Edmond and the Edmond public school district has made the Mitch\u2008Park Y a reality,\" said Mike Grady, President and CEO of the Greater Oklahoma City YMCA.  \"After 12 years of planning and what will be 18 months of construction, we are excited to finally open the doors to the public and continue to serve the community of Edmond.\"\n\n As part of the celebration, the Mitch Park Y will allow members of the community to view the facility prior to the grand opening.  Those interested can receive guided, hard-hat tours beginning in mid-November. Other festivities will take place the week of the grand opening with special activities for families, celebrity autograph sessions and more.\n \"The Mitch Park YMCA will be a great addition to our community,\" said Larry Stevens, Edmond City Manager.  \"This state of the art facility will address a significant need for an indoor recreational venue that has existed in Edmond for many years. It is a great example of a three-way partnership that ultimately became a reality when the timing was right for everyone.\"\n\n Just one week after the grand opening, The Mitch Park Y will host the OSSAA regional swim meet on Feb. 7-8 and the OSSAA state swim meet on Feb 21-22. \"We've waited such a long time to have a facility in Edmond where our athletes can compete locally,\" said Edmond Schools Athletic Director, Mike Nunley.   \"I'm particularly excited for our students and coaches, especially with the success that they've achieved over the years.\"\n Special promotions for Mitch Park have already begun and will continue through Jan. 31. \n\n This month, new members will be entered to win a free one-year family membership and the joining fee will be waived. Those enrolling in December will be eligible to win a free one-year individual membership and half-off the joining fee.  In January, new members will receive $25 off their joining fee.  New members will have the option of beginning their membership immediately or waiting for the opening of the MITCH PARK location.\n \nHard-hat tours for those 18 years of age and older will be available by appointment only starting this month. Those interested in early enrollment may do so at either the EMDOND or TRAILS locations.

I'm Sonia and today we'll be preparing a classic base recipe -- pastry dough perfect for making great pies. Let's see what ingredients we'll need:\n\u2022 1 \u00bd cups of powdered sugar\n\u2022 4 cups of flour\n\u2022 A pinch of salt  \u2022 Grated zest of one lemon\n\u2022 Four eggs -- we'll be using only the yolks\n\u2022 2 \u00bc sticks of cold butter cut into cubes.\nLet's begin making our pastry crust!\nLet's start by putting the flour into a food processor. Then add a pinch of salt, and the butter. Be sure it's very cold! Close the processor and whiz everything together until it resembles a coarse sand. \nOK. Now pour out the mixture onto a worktop. Add the powdered sugar and form an indentation into the top of the pile. Add to this the grated lemon zest and the egg yolks. Now knead everything together until you get a smooth dough.\nDon't work the dough for too long -- just until it's quite smooth. Now flatten it and form it into a loaf, turn it onto a sheet of plastic wrap, and place it into the refrigerator for at least an hour.\nOur pastry dough is ready. Now it can be rolled out and used in pies, biscuits and tarts.

It was awarded as the \"Most Performed Work in New Zealand\" in 2011 and had a lot of airplay in Germany and Uk too... In the video Brooke Fraser sings, dances and claps her hands... Brooke fell in love with the confessional lyrics and timeless melodies of James Taylor, Carole King, Joni Mitchell and Paula Cole, and eventually began to play the guitar. In 2002, when she was 18, Fraser signed with Sony Music and moved to Auckland where she played regularly at local venues while she wrote the songs that would appear on her debut album, What To Do With Daylight. That album, released in New Zealand in 2003, debuted at No. 1 and achieved gold status the same week. \n\nhttp://www.brookefraser.com\n\nhttp://www.timerec.it", "title": "Brooke Fraser - Something In The Water [Official Video HD]", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T01:52:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Axp1V71XwE", "description": "I am a Notary Public and Certified Signing Agent \nTie up those loose ends!!!!!!", "title": "Notary and Certified Signing Agent what I do for you!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-07T03:09:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8AxtdB1a9aE", "description": "\u4f60\u89ba\u5f97\u8c9d\u8c9d\u662fROOMIE\u7576\u4e2d\u6700\u6703\u8b1b\u51b7\u7b11\u8a71\u7684\u5718\u54e1\u55ce\uff1f\n\u8acb\u5230\u6b64\u7db2\u5740\u6295\u7968 https://www.facebook.com/questions/516208168430876/\n\u5c31\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u7372\u5f97ROOMIE\u6e96\u5099\u7684\u795e\u79d8\u597d\u79ae\u5537\uff01\n\nROOMIE 2013\u5e74\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u7279\u5225\u4f01\u5283\uff01\u8d85\u7d1a\u5168\u80fd\u5927PK\u767b\u5834\uff01\n\u6bcf\u500b\u6708\u6703\u90fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\uff0c\u8acb\u5ba4\u53cb\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\uff01\n\n\u8a73\u60c5\u8acb\u8a02\u95b1EMO\u5b98\u65b9YouTube\u983b\u9053 http://www.youtube.com/user/emoamdtw\n\u53ca\u9396\u5b9aROOMIE\u5b98\u65b9facebook\u7c89\u7d72\u5c08\u9801 https://www.facebook.com/avexRoomie", "title": "ROOMIE\u8d85\u7d1a\u5168\u80fd\u5927PK \u7b2c2\u96c6 \u51b7\u7b11\u8a71\u5927\u8cfd - \u8c9d\u8c9d\u7bc7", "publishedDate": "2013-03-11T05:56:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Ay1GByktfo", "description": "Dj MOURAD - Paris By Night 2011", "title": "Sabrine ft.

This means that every odd year, the State/Territory Landcare Awards need to be judged as the lead up to the National awards.\n\nWhile there are 12 state Landcare award categories, there are always some Landcare people, who despite the work they do, do not meet the strict criteria of the awards.\n\nFor this reason South East Landcare, partnering with Southern Rivers CMA, decided to promote separate awards in each of the 7 District Landcare Associations (DLAs) that make up South East Landcare in the Southern Rivers catchment. The purpose of these awards is to recognise the many Landcare enthusiasts we have, who, because what they do does not meet the strict criteria of the 12 state awards, will not receive recognition for the contributions they make, and without which, their local environment and their local community would be much poorer.\n\nFor this reason, Landcare Illawarra nominated a number of community groups and individuals as a local \"Champions\". \n\nJim Derbyshire and Terry Rankmore -- Landcare and Indigenous Education Award\n\nJim Derbyshire began his fight for Blackbutt Forest Reserve when, in 1978, the then state government proposed to clear cut the forest for public housing. Many, including Jim, protested so vigorously that the forest was given to the community to be held in trust by Shellharbour City Council. Since that time, Jim has been involved on and off with Blackbutt volunteers. In 2008, thirty years later, as his dicky back was getting more and more dicky, Jim switched from slashing away at lantana and other weeds to portraying the forest through art interpretation. Helped initially by his teacher daughter Celina, Jim set about working with students from the schools which had been involved in National Tree Day plantings at Blackbutt Forest. Various animals of the forest were outlined on calico by Jim, painted by the students --sometimes quite creatively -- then their edges were trimmed and they were glued on to a Blackbutt Forest backdrop painted by Jim. Each mural measures 90 cm by 150 cm, and the 18 murals completed by Jim and the school students in 2008, 2009 and 2010 are now displayed in nine local schools. A further three murals will be completed in October/November this year. Jim Derbyshire's imagination and rich artistic skills have led to proud, permanent and beautiful records of schools assisting with National Tree Day plantings, totaling 5,180 local indigenous plants at Blackbutt over the past four years. \n\nTerry Rankmore has a passion for native plants and a great admiration for the complex plant science of traditional aboriginal people. Terry is a regular volunteer on working bees at Blackbutt Forest Reserve, but his real love is building his knowledge of the usage of native plants by the aboriginal people of the Illawarra and sharing that knowledge as widely as possible. In 2009 Terry received a grant from Landcare Illawarra which enabled him to turn his private notes on plant use by the Dharawal people into Murni Dhungang - a beautiful, commercially printed, 70-page, full colour book on the plant foods and animal foods of the local, traditional aborigines. Three hundred copies were printed. Murni Dhungang was then introduced to teachers from twenty Illawarra schools at a two-hour workshop. Schools which sent a teacher to this workshop received a class set of books for their use. A grant from Southern Rivers CMA enabled 700 more copies of Terry's book to be printed. Workshops were conducted with a further twenty-three schools in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven, to help ensure that the substantial plant science of traditional aboriginal peoples was more widely appreciated and respected. Terry has now received a major grant from the NSW Environmental Trust to produce another book on Bush Medicines of the Illawarra. The Illawarra Aboriginal Corporation has been essential in backing this passion of Terry's to research and then share such vital understandings of aboriginal history.", "title": "Champions of The Catchment ~ Jim and Terry  (Landcare and Indigenous Education Award)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-22T06:41:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8B3RWAuiXl4", "description": "www.klezmerkollectiv.com\n\n1920's New York; well remembered for Jazz musicians such as Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey but have you heard of Naftule Brandwein? or Dave Tarras?

It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and a sequel to 2012's Assassin's Creed III modern story and a prequel to its ancestral storyline.\nIt is scheduled for a October 29, 2013 release in North America, a October 31, 2013 release for Australia, and a European release on November 1, 2013. It will be available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and the Xbox 360. A PlayStation 4 version is also in the works, but no release date has been announced yet.\n\nThe game will feature three main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, English and pirate influence, respectively. The game will also feature 50 locations to explore, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. Assassin's Creed IV will have a more open world feel, with missions similar to those found in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for the player. The world opens up sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins and small villages and the world is being built to allow players much more freedom, such as allowing players to engage, board, and capture passing ships and swimming to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin's Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and harpoon in the water.\n\nExtra Tags:\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag PC Gameplay\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag The Game\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Trailer\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag DLC\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag NEW\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Trailer\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Cutscene\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Opening\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Intro\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Ending\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay PC\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Achievements\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Guide\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag How To\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Achievement Guide\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Secret\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Easter Egg\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Gameplay\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 2\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 Commentary\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 With Commentary\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 No Commentary\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 PS3\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 Xbox 360\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Walkthrough Part 1 PC\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Walkthrough Part 1\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Trailer\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Gameplay\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Trailer\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Demo\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Review\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Trailer 2\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Review\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Trailer 2013\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Game Part 1\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Release Date\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Video Game\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag The Video Game\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Ending\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Final Boss\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Part 1\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Part 1 Xbox 360\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Part 1 PS3\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Part 1 PC\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Demo\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Trailer\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay Xbox 360\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay PS3\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Gameplay PC", "title": "Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag - Abaco Island Treasure Map Serpent Figurehead", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T04:10:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8BW6Eg8C89o", "description": "Stuffed 2 is on the way!\n\nNew Teasers!!!\nUnder the request of some one... the final teasers for Stuffed 2 for each character:\nFrederick: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Frederick-Wolf-493772248?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415657938\nLucky: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Lucky-Cat-493772302?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415657959\nHeleonore: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Heleonore-Duck-493772359?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415657973\nBartholomew: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Bartholomew-Panda-493772370?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415657991\nMina: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Mina-493772381?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415658005\nJeremy: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Jeremy-493772432?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415658200\nDr. Fazbear: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Dr-Joshua-Fazbear-493772495?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415658052\nLuke: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Luke-the-Marionette-493772596?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415658075\nGordon: http://taijutsufede97.deviantart.com/art/Stuffed-2-Final-Teaser-Gordon-493772597?ga_submit_new=10%253A1415658089", "title": "Stuffed 2 - Teaser Slideshow", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T21:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8BWx2rySydQ", "description": "Having a magic remote is amazing and it can do so many incredible things.

At the time, it was the world's largest and highest capacity haul truck - a distinction it held for 25 years. The Titan was first unveiled in October 1974 at the American Mining Congress in Las Vegas. Following this, it provided service until 1991 - first at Eagle Mountain, California and then in Sparwood, British Columbia, where it would spend the majority of its years of service. Today, it still resides in Sparwood where it is now a tourist attraction, sitting directly off of the #3 Highway.\n\nThe 33-19 \"Titan\" was slated to be in production by 1976 with a cost of 1.5 million dollars. However, due to various economic factors in the mining industry at the time, the Titan never made it to production. The prototype 33-19 \"Titan\" was the only unit of the model ever built.\n\nIt is 25' 7\" wide, 66' 9\" long, and stands at 22' 7\" in height. It had a payload capacity of 318,000 kg or 700,000 lbs. It would take until 1998 before any truck would have a greater payload capacity than this. The 33-19 \"Titan\" was powered by a 16 cylinder, 10,320-cubic-inch (169.1 L) diesel engine capable of producing a gross horsepower of 3300.

Even if you are taking medication to manage your very high triglycerides, your diet can still have a dramatic effect on your levels. Next time you cook, try following some of these easy recipe substitutions. Instead of 1 cup of whole milk, use 1 cup of fat-free milk plus one tablespoon of liquid vegetable oil. Swap out 1 cup of heavy cream for 1 cup of evaporated skim milk. Replace 1 tablespoon of butter with 1 tablespoon of soft margarine that is low in saturated fat and has 0 grams of trans fat. Rather than using 1 whole egg, use 2 egg whites. Fish is always a good choice, but choose ones that are high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids\u2014like salmon or tuna. On top of the heart-healthy benefits for those with very high triglycerides, omega-3's might even be linked to better brain health. Do the smart thing and follow this easy recipe for better triglyceride levels and better health. \n\nSources:\nSmart Substitutions. Dallas, TX: American Heart Association, 2010.

The largest attain a wingspan of 1.7 m (5.6 ft), weighing in at up to 1.6 kg. Most fruit bats have large eyes, allowing them to orient themselves visually in twilight and inside caves and forests.\n\nTheir sense of smell is excellent. In contrast to the microbats, the fruit bats do not use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus egyptiacus, which uses high-pitched tongue clicks to navigate in caves).\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Misoprostol is FDA approved to prevent gastric ulcers as prostaglandin E1 in the stomach is important for protecting the gastric lining from the prolonged administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).   Prostaglandins are found throughout the body serving multiple functions. Misoprostol causes uterine (womb) contractions by binding to the prostaglandin uterine receptors.  It is used in several areas of female reproductive health. Misoprostol was initially found to cause early miscarriages in women who did not realize they were pregnant. It is used to stop heavy vaginal bleeding after delivery or to induce labor of full term pregnancies. It is safe and effective in causing softening and opening of the cervix (priming of the cervix), which reduces the incidence of C-Sections, and Misoprostol alone is used for the medical abortion procedure in the first and second trimester and late term abortion.\n\nCytotec/Misoprostol  used as an abortion pill is used to perform medical pregnancy terminations in abortion clinics for patients who are 3 to 24 weeks or further (i.e. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 weeks)  if the pregnancy is a threat to the life or health of the mother, significant fetal abnormality, genetic defect, rape or incest.  The use of RU486 (Mifeprex/Mifepristone) helps to accelerate the abortion procedure and provide for completion in over 99% of patients within 24 hours or less with minimal to no complications.\n\nAs is noted, abortions may be performed even before a patient misses her first menstrual period using Cytotec/Misoprostol. Approximately 46% of abortion providers offer the medical or surgical procedure before a patient misses her first period.

Previously, the state and federal governments utilized a fair and efficient claims-sampling method (called the TPL Demo Project) to determine which program -- Medicare or Medicaid -- pays for home care services provided to tens of thousands of patients covered by both programs. That program expired in 2007. As a result, the state mandated that home care providers resubmit to Medicare thousands of prior-year paid claims, along with a mountain of related paperwork, to trigger a case-by-case redetermination of whether Medicare or Medicaid should have paid. This has cost providers thousands, in some cases millions, of dollars to achieve what the TPL Demo Project was able to resolve much more efficiently. New York's home care community is vigorously advocating for reauthorization of the TPL Demo Project at the federal level, which would save millions of dollars both for the government and for providers, removing an unnecessary administrative diversion from the provider's main task of delivering patient care.", "title": "MedicaidWhoPaysClip.mov", "publishedDate": "2010-03-20T14:30:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8BnS6puivC0", "description": "Information vedr\u00f8rende Zebibyte's ydelser", "title": "zebibyte promo", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T20:18:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Bncrbdbj0Q", "description": "", "title": "Fleischmann Leads Fight For Chickamauga Lock", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T22:05:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8BnesQDN4UA", "description": "First song from our EP \"Rise\" available soon\n\nMy own fear is a death/thrash metal band formed in 2011\n\nLine up :\n\nMarine : Vocal\nFab : Guitar\nSt\u00e9ph : Guitar\nGuillaume : Bass\nS\u00e9b : Drum\n\nFollow us on :\n\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/MyOwnFearBand\nTwitter : @MyOwnFear", "title": "My Own Fear - Black Chapel (Ft.

In our next story, we take a look at another school, Lytle Creek Elementary in Los Angeles, to see the kind of positive influence Jing Si aphorisms have had on its pupils.\n\nIncorporating Tzu Chi's human education\nTzu Chi volunteers are teaching Lytle Creek's students what is otherwise missing in a regular school syllabus: fostering a grateful heart for their teachers.\n\nTzu Chi volunteer, Lin Huiling:\n\"One of Tzu Chi's most important principles is putting things into practice. Based on that, our five-phase Jing Si aphorism curriculum aims to teach children the skill to turn knowledge into wisdom, and apply that in their lives.\"\n\nPositive role models for kids\nFor the fourth year now, every week the local Tzu Chi education development team convenes a curriculum meeting with the school. Lytle Creek Elementary has long been a stalwart supporter of Tzu Chi efforts, and in that regard it stands as a true success story among the schools in San Bernardino.\n\nLytle Creek Elementary School principal, Edward Gomez:\n\"Kids should get it in the primary grades, in the upper grades, hopefully with our positive relationship that we have with Tzu Chi, at some point they can be continued in that way because there is a great need for that, for kids to have positive role models.\"\n\nNurturing humanity in children\nTzu Chi's unique character-building course has been officially incorporated into Lytle Creek Elementary's curriculum. Starting with teaching just one grade to now three, the course is much appreciated by the school. \n\nLytle Creek Elementary School principal, Edward Gomez:\n\"It's very self-sacrificing, and Tzu Chi has been a tremendous asset to Lytle Creek, and we are very very thankful.\"\n\nTzu Chi volunteer, Lin Huiling:\n\"If we could train local teachers to become part of us, it would benefit many in the long run. As with our bilingual kindergarten, we hope to nurture both linguistic skills and humanity in our pupils.\"\n\nPassing on the value of humanity\nThe local Tzu Chi educational development center is also in charge of the curriculum for Tzu Chi Academies across the US. The main goal is to promote character-building in children. \n\nTzu Chi-US Education mission CEO, Mu Citao:\n\"When you encounter a challenge, it might dawn on you that yes, you have learned before how to cope with this kind of situation, and go on and deal with it.\"\n\nFor San Francisco Tzu Chi volunteers, it is their lifelong mission to pass on the value of humanity and promote the importance of morality from school to school.", "title": "Character building part of school curriculum", "publishedDate": "2009-11-07T02:17:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8C9KBqqUt0Q", "description": "Uruguay es el nuevo Rey de Am\u00e9rica.\nUruguay se consagr\u00f3 campe\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica al superar en juego y car\u00e1cter a Paraguay, con un contundente 3 a 0.

An influential theatre practitioner of the twentieth century, Brecht made equally significant contributions to dramaturgy and theatrical production, the latter particularly through the seismic impact of the tours undertaken by the Berliner Ensemble\u2014the post-war theatre company operated by Brecht and his wife and long-time collaborator, the actress Helene Weigel\u2014with its internationally acclaimed productions.[1]\n\nFrom his late twenties Brecht remained a life-long committed Marxist who, in developing the combined theory and practice of his 'epic theatre', synthesized and extended the experiments of Erwin Piscator and Vsevolod Meyerhold to explore the theatre as a forum for political ideas and the creation of a critical aesthetics of dialectical materialism. Brecht's modernist concern with drama-as-a-medium led to his refinement of the 'epic form' of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other arts, including the strategy of divergent chapters in James Joyce's novel Ulysses, Sergei Eisenstein's evolution of a constructivist 'montage' in the cinema, and Picasso's introduction of cubist 'collage' in the visual arts.[2]\n\nIn contrast to many other avant-garde approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to destroy art as an institution; rather, he hoped to 're-function' the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the aesthetic debates of his era\u2014particularly over the 'high art/popular culture' dichotomy\u2014vying with the likes of Adorno, Luk\u00e1cs, Bloch, and developing a close friendship with Benjamin. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its psychological and socialist varieties. \"Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since Ibsen and Strindberg,\" Raymond Williams argues, while Peter B\u00fcrger dubs him \"the most important materialist writer of our time.\"[3]\n\nCollective and collaborative working methods were inherent to Brecht's approach, as Fredric Jameson (among others) stresses. Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that \"certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or individualistic sense.\" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, scenographers, directors, dramaturgs and actors; the list includes: Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Ruth Berlau, Slatan Dudow, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Caspar Neher, Teo Otto, Karl von Appen, Ernst Busch, Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Therese Giehse, Angelika Hurwicz, Carola Neher, and Helene Weigel herself. This is \"theatre as collective experiment [...] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience.\"[4]\n\nThere are few areas of modern theatrical culture that have not felt the impact or influence of Brecht's ideas and practices; dramatists and directors in whom one may trace a clear Brechtian legacy include: Dario Fo, Augusto Boal, Joan Littlewood, Peter Brook, Peter Weiss, Heiner M\u00fcller, Pina Bausch, Tony Kushner and Caryl Churchill. In addition to the theatre, Brechtian theories and techniques have exerted considerable sway over certain strands of film theory and cinematic practice; Brecht's influence may be detected in the films of Jean-Luc Godard, Lindsay Anderson, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Joseph Losey, Nagisa Oshima, Ritwik Ghatak, Lars von Trier, Jan Bucquoy and Hal Hartley.\n fuente: www.wikipedia.org", "title": "Bertolt Brecht", "publishedDate": "2008-12-19T23:17:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8CFaa646haU", "description": "Drama Button (Beredskabsudgave)\n\nRoskilde Brandv\u00e6sen sluttede sin hvervekampagne af p\u00e5 St\u00e6ndertorvet i hjertet af Roskilde.\n\nDet skete med et brag af et event i form af en s\u00e5kaldt drama button.\n\nI kan se en del af hvad der skete den er dog langt fra f\u00e6rdig klippet.", "title": "Drama button St\u00e6ndertorvet,Roskilde Denmark Raw cut", "publishedDate": "2013-04-21T11:41:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8CFfNACnSQo", "description": "The woman fell from high tension wire while flying as a bird and turned into this woman at Oshodi Lagos.The woman, who was badly burnt, was accused of transforming from a bird into a human being.

First, make sure your indirect drain lines are offset to allow easy extraction of the basket.  This ensures the kitchen staff can extract the floor sink's basket without dropping food into the sink and thus creating a potential trash can out of the floor sink.  Often times, kitchen operators will remove the strainer underneath the basket and dump the contents of the basket and sink down the drain and thus create clogs in the P-Trap below the sink. \n Installing the Guardian drain lock in your kitchen sink will prevent food and other unwanted material from going down the drain and creating clogs in your pipes below.

So the main thing when\nchoosing a lip color that is going to accent the whiteness of your teeth is\nmaking sure that it has a blue undertone.\n\nSo I already have a few of these colors on my arm here, going from lightest\nkind of getting a little bit deeper. As you can see, I started with a\nglossy type of pink that has the blue undertone, something that's a little\nmore purple, then some pinks that are getting bolder as we're going up.\n\nNow, next I'm going to add something that has more of a red undertone. Reds\nare really nice for this too, and then as you can see I have just a regular\nred on right now, and that really does make your teeth pop. There's one and\nnow a just kind of regular red, just like what I'm wearing. But you do want\nit to be less of an orange-red and more of a blue-red.\n\nOne thing to steer away from is definitely nudes. Nudes do not compliment\nyour teeth. They're going to only contrast with the yellowness or staining\nthat your teeth have. The reason that something that's more of a golden or\nan orange undertone is because it picks up yellow. So they're similar\nundertones in the yellowness of the teeth, and then in the lip color, it's\nonly going to create more of that tone in your teeth.\n\nSo definitely choose blue undertones and that's how you make your teeth\nlook whiter with lip color.", "title": "Lip Colors That Make Teeth Look Whiter | Makeup Tips", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T12:55:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8COUsNHR4Jw", "description": "Kid Moxie's new video for their track \"Hollywood Smile.\" Directed by Locke Webster, Produced by Megan Fraher www.lockedirector.com", "title": "Kid Moxie - Hollywood Smile", "publishedDate": "2008-01-09T00:46:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8COenMkEuw8", "description": "La falla que provoc\u00f3 el terremoto de Nicaragua de 1972 ser\u00eda la responsable de la ola de temblores de las \u00faltimas horas.
