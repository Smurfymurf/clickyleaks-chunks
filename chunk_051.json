Detroit has a large collection of early 20th century architecture, and the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel itself is one of the most stunning examples of architectural restoration. After many years of abandonment and decay, this 1924 Art Deco stunner was recently renovated at a cost of over $200 million. \n \nBob and I walked south on Washington Avenue and admired the 1923 Lafayette Building, the 1928 Penobscot Building, the Federal Court Building and the Detroit Free Press Building. A short walk away is the stunning Guardian Building, a 1925 Art Deco jewel with extensive Aztec-style decorations that used to be called the Cathedral of Finance. This building quickly became my Detroit favourite.\n\nFurther south we explored Hart Plaza, Detroits Civic Centre which features several interesting sculptures. The waterfront right next to it is highlighted by the Gateway to Freedom, an impressive sculpture commemorating the Underground Railroad that was dedicated in 2001. Back up in the city we admired Campus Martius Park, a recently redesigned outdoor gathering place for many Detroiters. \n\nAfter a brief peek into the Art Deco-era David Stott Building we headed back to Washington Boulevard and took in the Kales Building, the David Broderick Tower and the David Whitney Building. This area, also referred to as skyscraper graveyard, was also home to the renowned Statler Hotel and the Hotel Tuller, both now demolished.  \n\nOur architectural walking tour concluded with a visit to Detroits Eastern Market which was hustling and bustling on this Saturday morning.", "title": "An Architectural Walking Tour of Detroit - Penobscot Building", "publishedDate": "2009-01-08T20:16:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2A7mGwxh76Y", "description": "A GUY SKING UP RIVER ON A BOAT DOCK", "title": "BOAT DRAGIN A BOAT DOCK UP RIVER WITH GUY ON IT", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T15:35:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2A7qqfJYXOc", "description": "When your prey's in a crack, and you can't get it back, fetch a moray\n\nVideo courtesy of Redouan Bshary \n\nhttp://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431", "title": "Grouper and moray eel team up", "publishedDate": "2011-10-24T00:50:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2A8F0gmhJ_4", "description": "", "title": "Quran Surah Al Maoon 0107 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u062f\u064a \u0635\u064a\u0627\u0641 \u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T03:48:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2A9MBzQ9K28", "description": "\u25b6Please do not reupload on youtube", "title": "[FANCAM] GOT7 Zepp Tour - TRUE SWAG (Mark focus)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T14:23:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2AA-lFPwTFA", "description": "Title: Curtain Call\nComposer: John Wasson\nPublisher: C.

Joseline made repeated threats to Benzinos's fiance Althea and eventually tried to rush her. But Althea wasn't having it; as Joseline tried to rush Althea she got punched in the eye and she went down into a fetal position. The fight also spilled into the audience. Fans were snapping photos, shouting and causing an even bigger commotion.\n\nJoseline received medical attention for her black eye on set. She refused to be taken to the hospital. You guys should expect pictures of eye to be surfacing on the web any minute now. I thought Joseline was a gangster but I guess she met her match this time. Stevie J gotta keep that ice pack on her eye so she can heal quick.\n\nAlthea went to her Twitter about the fight and tweeted \"I hate fighting. I was lookin too cute. All the women on the show looked better then her But it's not who starts but who finishes love u Zino\" I don't think that its finished because Joseline seems like a crazy bitch. So watch your back Althea lol.\n\nThe police were also called to the set and the filming of the Love & Hip Hop Atlanta Reunion was stopped short. Sources say the filming will resume today but who knows with all the drama going on over there.  Stevie J shouldn't of leaked those naked photos of Althea, now Joseline had to pay for it with a black eye. LMAO!\n\nI can't wait to watch this season's reunion show with one of my lady friends. I'm going to be in tears laughing at the drama all of them subject their-selves to being on Love & Hip Atlanta. I wonder whats going to happen with Stevie J and Benzino due to him leaking those naked photos of Althea.\n\nThere are a few conflicting reports suggesting that Joseline was actually jumped backstage by two cast members \u2014 not yet named. You just got love the drama on Love & Hip Hop Atlanta.

Women have more important things to do. Men are aware of this and that is why in this and every other society they look to women for gentleness, kindness and love, for refuge from the world of pain and force, from safety from their own excesses. In every society a basic male motivation is the feeling that women and children must be protected. But women cannot have it both ways: if she wishes to sacrifice all this, what she will get in return is the right to meet men on male terms. She will lose.

I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making skills. \n\n\nI'm gonna show you how to make a cappuccino. A cappuccino is traditionally between five and six ounces. You have your shot of espresso, some milk, and then foam on top. Usually it's gonna be in thirds, which is two ounces of espresso, two ounces of milk, two ounces of foam, but somewhere around there is good. Officially, they say between one and two centimeters of foam on top, but there are many different interpretations. So, let's start off by pulling the shot, steaming the milk, and then pouring it. OK, so we have our espresso, we have our milk. Since I've let more air into the milk on this cappuccino we can do a little bit extra texturing, which is just swirling it around. You can give it some side to side shakes to incorporate the foam into the center. Sometimes if you've added just a little bit too much, you can pour about an ounce off the top. All right, now just pour and that is a delicious looking cappuccino.", "title": "How to Make a Cappuccino | Perfect Coffee", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T17:13:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2AoJ5Qy4hoE", "description": "First draft of \"HOW TO PLANT YOUR HYDRANGEA\" produced by Horticultural Marketing & Printing for the Berry Family of Nurseries.", "title": "HOW TO PLANT YOUR HYDRANGEA - no logos", "publishedDate": "2012-06-11T18:57:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2AoSzesF68U", "description": "Normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings are shown here.

It was the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. The accident  was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel. Ironically,  the disaster occurred  during a systems safety test performed to test whether the reactor had the capability to ride through the first 60--70 seconds of a total loss of electric power during an emercengy shutdown.  A sudden high power output surge took place, and when an attempt was made for emergency shutdown, a more extreme spike in power output,  about 10 times the rated maximum output, occurred leading to reactor core explosion. This threw large quantities of radioactive core materials into the atmosphere and exposed the graphite moderator components of the reactor to air so they started to burn. The resulting fire sent a cloud of radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and over an extensive geographical area, including the nearby town Pripyat. The cloud drifted over large parts of the western Soviet Union, and Europe.  Large areas in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia had to be evacuated, with over 300,000 people resettled.  \nTwo Chernobyl plant workers died on the night of the accident, and a further 28 people died within a few weeks as a result of acute radiation poisoning. Radiation doses on the first day were estimated to range up to 20000 millisieverts (mSv). \nThe next task was cleaning up the radioactivity at the site. About 200,000 people ('liquidators') from all over the Soviet Union were involved in the recovery and clean-up during 1986 and 1987. They received high doses of radiation, averaging around 100 millisieverts. Some 20,000 of them received about 250 mSv and a few received 500 mSv. The highest doses were received by about 1000 emergency workers and on-site personnel during the first day of the accident.\nInitial radiation exposure in contaminated areas was due to short-lived iodine-131; later cesium-137 was the main hazard. About five million people lived in areas contaminated (above 37000 Bq/m2 Cs-137) and about 400000 lived in more contaminated areas of strict control by authorities (above 555000 Bq/m2 Cs-137). \nAmong the residents of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine there had been, up to 2002, about 4000 cases of thyroid cancer reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time of the accident, and more cases are to be expected during the next decades. Many of those cancers were most likely caused by radiation exposures shortly after the accident.\n\n\n\nVideos about radiation detection: \n\nRadioactive Americium 241 containing smoke detector dismantled: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaU3zMzO5Xk\n\nDeflection of Americium 241 alpha particles by a Neodymium magnet: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkO4PZn2_Vs\n\nHigh alpha's cpm count should not be interpreted as high \u00b5Sv/hr (gamma) reading: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHatTVryZM\n\nVideo about Radium-226 radiation from Jefferson Mystery clock: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAJJTZVo2SY\n\nVideo about radioactive granite kitchen sink: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lns0jqzNkew\n\nVideo about the Cesium-137 cloud from Chernobyl which I, ironically, uploaded one month before \"Fukushima\" : \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ApKvCtHGDc", "title": "Chernobyl 25 years ago;  radioactive Cesium 137 cloud over Russia and Europe", "publishedDate": "2011-02-24T15:11:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ApcR6sYa74", "description": "Celebrity landscaper Ahmed Hassan meets up with landscape contractor Jose Garcia to talk about Shindaiwa equipment. \n\nTo learn more about Shindaiwa's professional-grade power equipment, check out http://www.shindaiwa-usa.com/.", "title": "Landscape Contractor Tests out Shindaiwa Equipment", "publishedDate": "2014-01-23T18:08:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Apjjd9wBDo", "description": "Music video by Royal Tailor performing Give Me Faith (Official Pseudo Video).

Grow these beauties in your garden for a delightful new protein.\n\n\nStep 1: Choose a site\nChoose a gardening site with full sun, good irrigation, and crumbly soil.\n\nStep 2: Till the soil\nTill the soil to remove any underlying weeds and to aerate the soil.\n\nTip\nIf you need to add soil to a garden, choose soil that has a low sand content.\n\nStep 3: Apply fertilizer and till\nApply fertilizer using 1 cup fertilizer per 50 feet of garden. Till the soil to a depth of 6 inches to incorporate the fertilizer. Then lightly water the soil to moisten it.\n\nStep 4: Plant in early spring\nPlant the seeds in early spring, when the soil has reached a temperature of at least 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nStep 5: Plant seeds\nPlant the seeds 1 to 2 inches apart and 3 to 6 inches deep. If you plan on having more than one row of seeds, the rows should be 24 inches apart.\n\nStep 6: Cover with mulch\nCover the seeds with soil and then add 2 to 3 inches of mulch to keep the soil moist and keep the weeds at bay.\n\nStep 7: Water\nWater the garden once a week, early in the morning, and provide about an inch of water to the entire area. Early morning watering will give the plants time to dry out and reduce the chance of disease.\n\nStep 8: Weed as needed\nWeed the garden using shallow strokes to avoid uprooting your bean plants. Allow the garden to dry after a heavy rain before weeding.\n\nTip\nIf your growing season is short due to cold, you can cover the soil with black plastic sheeting to warm up the soil and to prevent weeds.\n\nStep 9: Pick the beans\nPick the beans when the pods are plump, green, and filled with seeds -- in about 4 to 5 months.\n\nStep 10: Rotate your crop location\nRotate the location of your bean plantings each year to reduce nitrogen buildup in the soil so you can enjoy these yummy beans every summer.\n\nDid You Know?\nFava beans are one of the world's oldest cultivated plants, being grown over 5,000 years ago.", "title": "How to Grow Fava Beans", "publishedDate": "2011-03-31T15:15:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2B-fTEx7ukE", "description": "Reason.tv presents Citizens Against Government Waste's Porker of the Month for February 2011:\n\nRep.

It is under the proprietorship of Miss Mona Stangley, having been left to her by the original owner. While taking care of her girls, she is also on good terms with the local sheriff, Ed Earl Dodd.

I'm a medical doctor and a naturopathic doctor and I live in beautiful Maui. I've finished my 22nd health book, I have a free newsletter and I also have an online wellness program that you can join. And today in this series I'll be talking about dieting.  The Macrobiotic diet is a weight loss diet. It's a big commitment. It's a lifestyle program, and it's also a spiritual lifestyle. It was begun in Japan by Zen Buddhists and it includes um, spiritualism, that their yin and yang philosophy where the yin foods are sweet and cold, and the yang foods are hot and spicy. So it's a balancing of those two food types. They go into the various tastes of sweet, sour, salty, so there's a lot involved and um, the diet itself is very high carbohydrate. Some diets are 50 to 60 percent brown rice entirely. The protein, there's a minimum amount of fish in the diet, it can only be like 5 or 10 percent. There are nuts and seeds, so it may be 80 percent carbohydrate and 20 percent protein at most. The soy products used in a macrobiotic diet are fermented soy, tempe, and miso, which is a good form of soy to ingest. The soy that blocks the thyroid, and binds up minerals in a bad way, the tofus, and the soy powders. So, their tempe and miso is, is good, but for a lot of people, including myself, that soy is very difficult to digest. You have to be careful when you go on the extreme diet like the macrobiotic diet. I think um, an A blood group could probably handle it as well as an AB diet, um, blood type could probably handle it. But for an O blood group, who requires a lot of animal protein, it, it's not going to work.", "title": "How to Lose Weight on Macrobiotic Diet | Diet Plans", "publishedDate": "2011-08-12T14:39:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BHPO-EaZw8", "description": "Here is a review for some hand sensitizer but thanks for watching byeee oh reamber  review skiers going on \nCreated using VideoFX Live: http://VideoFXLive.com/FREE", "title": "REVIEW hand sensitizers  (witch one is the best for u) \ud83d\ude03", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T05:43:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BHhfqXlfL8", "description": "More details:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nMore About Manganese processing plant, Please Visit:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nSBM as one of the largest mining and crushing equipments manufacturers and vendors all over the world, we provide cone crusehr, jaw crusher, grinding mill, mobile crusher, ball mill, washer machine, vibrating screen, belt conveyor, etc for quarry plant to process iron, gold, aggregate, artificial sand, limestone, asphalt, ballast, bauxite, brick, cement, ceramic, clay, concrete, construction, glass, gypsum, kaolin, coke, coal, barite, bentonite, clinker, dolomite, earth, feldspar, fluorspar, fly ash, garnet, graphite, gravel, marble, talc, mica, perlite, porcelain, pozzolana, quartz, rubble, salt, silica, slate, soapstone, soda, sizing, bottle, aluminum, antimony, calcium, chrome, copper, diamond, hematite, Lead, lithium, magnesium, magnetite, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, pyrite, anthracite,etc.\nSBM company provide quarry plant machine for India, Oman, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Amercia, Indonesia, Sri lanka, Ghana, Uae, Iran, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi arabia, Australia, Thailand, Burma, Yemen, UK, Hungary, British, France, Russian, Gemany, England, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Nigera, Botswana, SA, Nigeria, Uganda, Gabon, Zambia, Ethiopia , Mauritania, USA, Canada, Peru, etc more than 100 countries.\nIf you need the answers of the questions, you can send messages to us or by the online services:http://www.crusherscom.com/inquiry.php\nmanganese processing plant South Africa,manganese ...\nmanganese processing plant.

The nearest railway station is Chidambaram from where it is accessible by road.\n\nPichavaram mangrove forest is located between two prominent estuaries, the Vellar estuary in the north and Coleroon estuary in the south. The Vellar - Coleroon estuarine complex forms the Killai backwater and Pichavaram mangroves.The backwaters, interconnected by the Vellar and Coleroon river systems, offer abundant scope for water sports such as rowing, kayaking and canoeing. The Pichavaram forest not only offers waterscape and backwater cruises, but also another very rare sight[citation needed] - the mangrove forest trees are permanently rooted in a few feet of water.\n\nPichavaram (MadBoon) has a well-developed mangrove forest. Pichavaram consists of a number of islands interspersing a vast expanse of water covered with green trees. The area is about 1100 Hectare and is separated from the sea by a sand bar.\nThe Pichavaram mangrove[1] biotope, consisting of rare species like Avicennia and Rhizophara presents a special attraction, with its peculiar topography and environmental condition. It supports the existence of many rare varieties of economically important shell and finfishes.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichavaram", "title": "Pichavaram Mangrove Forest Video #1- Tamil Nadu Tourism, India", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07T14:41:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BLB6b7DRIU", "description": "\u0130ndigo'nun 'Mutsuz' alb\u00fcm\u00fcn\u00fcn ilk par\u00e7as\u0131na klip \u00e7ekildi!\n(Produced & Directed) By Ferhat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 @Funky Production\nhttp://www.facebook.com/indigoizmir\nhttp://twitter.com/indigokarsiyaka\nhttp://www.youtube.com/indigo35karsiyaka\nhttp://www.indigo35.com\nhttp://www.funkyproduksiyon.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/frhtklc\n\n--\n\n-nakarat-\nm\u00fczik end\u00fcstrisi m\u00fczi\u011fimi y\u00f6netemez\nyapmazsam i\u00e7imden geleni beceremem\nemir ald\u0131\u011f\u0131m tek ki\u015fi keyfim\no da kafas\u0131na g\u00f6re de\u011fi\u015fik\n\nm\u00fczik mekanda sokakta devam eder\nm\u00fczik ara\u00e7ta u\u00e7akta devam eder\nm\u00fczik evinde d\u0131\u015farda devam eder\nher \u015fey durur ama m\u00fczik devam eder\n-nakarat-\n\nbunun i\u00e7in var bu kulakl\u0131k\ntakar y\u00fcr\u00fcrs\u00fcn bakt\u0131n bunald\u0131n\nonu bile \u00e7\u0131kart yanl\u0131\u015f bu mant\u0131k\ndiyo kimi zaman kendini \u00fcniforma sanan\n\nkopya bile \u00e7ekiyom sanan hocam oluyo\nyok ya dedim ama i\u015fe yaramad\u0131 \naz daha uzasayd\u0131 mevzu\nd\u00fc\u015f\u00fcn etmicekti beni mezun\n\nkorkmay\u0131n bu kadar m\u00fczikten\nsizce sessizlik daha m\u0131 g\u00fczel (ha?)\ntabi ki hay\u0131r bilmiyom do\u011frusu nas\u0131l ama\nl\u00fctfen m\u00fczik haram olmas\u0131n\n\nmoral verir bozar se\u00e7 se\u00e7en\nbi an sevin\u00e7 ya\u015far yada\nh\u00fcz\u00fcn bi ya\u015f bile gelir tak\u0131lma nedenine \nula\u015ft\u0131 o m\u00fczik hedefine\n\n-nakarat-\nm\u00fczik end\u00fcstrisi m\u00fczi\u011fimi y\u00f6netemez\nyapmazsam i\u00e7imden geleni beceremem\nemir ald\u0131\u011f\u0131m tek ki\u015fi keyfim\no da kafas\u0131na g\u00f6re de\u011fi\u015fik\n\nm\u00fczik mekanda sokakta devam eder\nm\u00fczik ara\u00e7ta u\u00e7akta devam eder\nm\u00fczik evinde d\u0131\u015farda devam eder\nher \u015fey durur ama m\u00fczik devam eder\n-nakarat-\n\ni\u00e7ine girince anl\u0131yosun i\u015fin\nm\u00fczikle ilgisi yok ba\u015fka bi\u015fey\nvar arkas\u0131nda, pe\u015finde bu kadar ki\u015fi\nkes kutuplar\u0131 \u00e7eten hangisi\n\nbelli et, yap d\u00fcet, \u00f6v az\ndiss dedi\u011finde patronun s\u00f6v lan\nkomutla \u00e7al\u0131\u015fan bi g\u00f6t bak bu rap\u00e7i\nona s\u00f6v\u00fcp onla \u00e7al\u0131\u015fanlar\u0131n hepsi\n\nsonra \"piyasa niye bok\" ne sa\u00e7ma bi soru!\n\u00f6nce bi bize bak cevapla\ndandik bi parodi dizisi gibiyiz\nen aptal adam bile izlemez 5 hafta\n\nbitirin hadi, \u015fi\u015firilmi\u015f kiminin ad\u0131\nkimi gircek \u015fimdi tribe nas\u0131l?\nunutamam abilerim, biggie ve pac'\u0131!\nevim kar\u015f\u0131yaka, derim bunu \u00e7\u0131kana kadar;\n\ndilimde nas\u0131r, dilimde nas\u0131r..\n\n-nakarat-\nm\u00fczik end\u00fcstrisi m\u00fczi\u011fimi y\u00f6netemez\nyapmazsam i\u00e7imden geleni beceremem\nemir ald\u0131\u011f\u0131m tek ki\u015fi keyfim\no da kafas\u0131na g\u00f6re de\u011fi\u015fik\n\nm\u00fczik mekanda sokakta devam eder\nm\u00fczik ara\u00e7ta u\u00e7akta devam eder\nm\u00fczik evinde d\u0131\u015farda devam eder\nher \u015fey durur ama m\u00fczik devam eder\n-nakarat-\n\nyo, end\u00fcstriye kar\u015f\u0131 tavr\u0131m\u0131n tam olarak ne oldu\u011funu anlad\u0131k dimi? ferhat bunu ger\u00e7e\u011fe d\u00f6n\u00fc\u015ft\u00fcrmemi sa\u011flad\u0131\u011f\u0131n i\u00e7in te\u015fekk\u00fcr ederim, ferhat k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7. ve funky st\u00fcdyo. istanbulday\u0131z. ben indigo, o konuda 1 s\u0131k\u0131nt\u0131m\u0131z da yok dimi?\n\nha?\n\nayr\u0131ca bana end\u00fcstrinin istedi\u011fi m\u00fczi\u011fi yap\u0131p i\u00e7ine girip cebine paray\u0131 koyduktan sonra inand\u0131\u011f\u0131 m\u00fczi\u011fi yapmaya ba\u015flamaktan bahseden arkada\u015flara s\u00f6yleyecek 1 \u00e7ift laf\u0131m var; size bol \u015fans, ben ba\u015fka 1 yoldan git\u00e7em.\n\ng\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f\u00fcr\u00fcz.\n\n--", "title": "\u0130ndigo - End\u00fcstri (Video Klip)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-18T15:01:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BLDCdEHq0I", "description": "Wielkie metropolie idealne na serwer - spr\u00f3bujcie sami :D\nDok\u0142adny dopis szablonu: (distance=0 size=100)\nLink do serii z Kapitana Pazura: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfZz27JmcNw", "title": "Minecraft Tricks: Niesko\u0144czone wioski NPC!", "publishedDate": "2013-02-15T16:16:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BLIlFZ7q2Q", "description": "Amazing Grace: The Pipes and Drums and Military Band of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. After almost 300 years, the name of THE ROYAL SCOTS GREYS is to disappear from the Order of Battle in the British Army on 2nd July, 1971. But while it is sad that a Regiment of such fame and of such fine tradition should be no more, this is also an occasion to welcome a new and fine Regiment. The Royal Scots Greys (2nd Dragoons) is amalgamating with the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales Dragoon Guards) to form Scotland's new armoured Regiment, THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS (Carabiniers and Greys). The histories of both the Greys in 1678 and the Carabiniers in 1685. Both served with distinction in Marlborough's Wars and in the Seven Years' War. During the Napoleonic Wars, both Regiments served under Wellington, including action in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo where the Scotsmen made their famous charge on their legendary grey mounts. It was then that Sergeant Ewart of the Greys captured the Eagles standard of Napoleon's Invincible Legion, the French 45th Regiment of Infantry. To this day, the Eagle has been the cap badge of the Royal Scots Greys, and it will continue to be worn by the new Regiment, backed by the carbines of the 3rd Carabiniers. Both Regiments serves in South Africa during the Boer War and they fought in the trenches during the First World War. From 1939 to 1945, The Greys fought in Palestine, North Africa, Italy and North-west Europe, while the Carabiniers formed part of the 14th Army in Burma. In keeping with the great traditions and honours from which it has been bred, the new Regiment of ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS is ready now to take its place as part of the spearhead of Britain's armoured forces. Equipped with the sophisticated \"hardware\" of the modern cavalry, the new Regiment will serve initially with the British Forces of the Rhine in Germany. This album features the music of the Mili8tayr Band of the Pipes and Drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, both bands being made up from the fine musicians of each Regiment, and also the \"Russian Imperial Anthem\" which has been played at Guest Nights in Russia, was Colonel-In-Chief of the Regiment. This stirring and moving music will bring a flush of pride and a tear to the eyes of many thousands of Greys and Carabiniers, both past and present, and, I am sure, it will provide entertainment of the highest order for the many more people who have read of these Regiments' glories through the mists of history.  --Pete Kerr.", "title": "Slow Air (Going Home) - Royal Scots Dragoon Guards", "publishedDate": "2010-11-15T01:13:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BLrJ_ElfN4", "description": "For today's adventure, I shake the larch cones I collected last week (having left them to open in a warm place).

The goal of this project is to make palpable and audible the hidden the invisible electromagnetic frequencies permeating everyday being, the same frequencies which provide the main transmission medium for radio, SMS text messaging, visible light, wireless internet connections and that radiate outwardly from any object with an active electrical current.\n\nOur electronic objects reach out to us by creating low frequency electromagnetic fields. These ubiquitous frequencies penetrate and permeate our bodies at the molecular level, so spatially intimate experiences with electronics can be understood as the merging of our physical bodies with the their electromagnetic embrace. As we humans have no natural means of sensing these frequencies, the EM Brace provides a way to physically exerience these frequencies by combining two of our natural senses, touch and hearing.\n\nThe device transforms electronically emitted electromagnetic signals into low-frequency audio waves that are used to vibrate the body via a homemade amplifier and \"bass shaker\" speaker mounted within an wearable metallic enclosure.\n\nAs a device for exploring and navigating these hidden \"hertzian\" spaces, the EM Brace accentuates the boundlessness of the quantum levels at which this microscopic merging of phyiscal bodies with electronics takes place, while simultaneously situating the body in relation to consumer and communication technologies. \n\nMore info:http://jnhasty.com/embrace/", "title": "Nick Hasty - EM Brace, Wearable Communication Device 2008", "publishedDate": "2008-05-31T14:32:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BUGi2NbVRA", "description": "Bal folk \u00e0 Aveize (69) le 18/10/2014", "title": "roumania hora", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T10:35:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BVA84WKbIk", "description": "Many women report that they've been told to scrub a bit harder to remove the dirt from the back of their neck.

I feel like I haven't jumped too far onto the chevron bandwagon yet, until I realized the two main areas I've used it in the nursery - the rug and this chevron pouf! It's so bright and playful for a nursery, how could I not? \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make the chevron, especially using the tutorial from Better Homes & Gardens (find it here). I tried to take pictures as I went, but forgive me if I'm lacking a bit... the tutorial is really great though, so maybe just use that?\n\nI found the fabric at JoAnn's and it's actually outdoor polyester fabric. It's really thick and I think it will be easier to keep clean than regular home decor fabric. I love the colorful chevron pattern and it works perfectly with the nursery colors. Once I cut out the paper pattern and taped it all together, it was super easy to cut out the eight fabric pieces to sew together. They recommend using a liner, so I used an old sheet. I also used polyester outdoor thread. It's super heavy duty and I figured it would hold the whole thing together better in the long haul.  I tried my best to cut the fabric consistently so I could line up the chevron, and I think I did a pretty decent job. Next I just sewed all the pieces together - two sections of the four pieces each (check out the tutorial as I didn't take pictures... I was on a roll!). \n\nAfter sewing all the pieces together and leaving a big gap at the top, it was time for stuffing! The pouf is actually really large and to stuff it solely with fiberfill would be crazy expensive. The tutorial suggested using old towels/jeans/rags, so that's what I did. Two birds with one stone since I didn't have to bring all that stuff to Goodwill anyways! Boom. Once I got a good base with my towels and jeans (beware - it gets heavy!), then I started stuffing with the fiberfill along the outside to give it good shape and then along the top (about the top two inches) to make it soft enough to sit on as well. Then I just sewed it up as best I could (and not very pretty since I knew it wouldn't show once the top octagon piece was on). The hardest part was sewing on the top part... I didn't use the suggested method in the tutorial because I didn't like the zig zag look. Too obvious and reminded me of a baseball or something. Instead, I just used a blanket stitch as best I could around the exterior of the top only (not down each side stitch like in the tutorial). It was a pain! The angle is so awkward and it definitely took me a while, but I am happy with the result. It's not too noticeable, and that's what I was going for. That's it! Actually an easy project until the end top stitching and for much cheaper than you could find on Etsy! The only thing is that when you use the towels/jeans/etc for stuffing, it gets heavy very quickly. I can't even lift it up by myself! It's OK because I don't think I'll be moving it all that often and I want it to be sturdy anyways. I can't wait to use it in the nursery as a foot rest while I'm rocking Little Miss to sleep at 2am (except maybe the 2am part...).", "title": "DIY: Chevron Pouf Ottoman", "publishedDate": "2013-09-21T08:18:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BZZgs6s0O0", "description": "2012\ub144 10\uc6d4 18\uc77c \ubaa9\uc694\uc77c\n\uc624\ub80c\uc9c0\uceac\ub77c\uba5c_\ub9bd\uc2a4\ud2f1\nLipstick by Orange Caramel@Mcountdown 2012.10.18\n\nWanna know more about your favorite K-pop artist?\n- Subscribe http://www.youtube.com/mnet \n- Follow http://www.twitter.com/MnetMcountdown\n- Like http://www.fb.com/MnetMAMA\n- Visit http://global.mnet.com", "title": "\uc624\ub80c\uc9c0\uceac\ub77c\uba5c_\ub9bd\uc2a4\ud2f1(Lipstick by Orange Caramel@Mcountdown 2012.10.18)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T11:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BZfJrECQck", "description": "Check out Gabriel's intriguing books! http://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Morris/e/B001JS0KOS/\nOr see Gabriel's other books on a wide range of subjects from romance to spirituality to adventure travel:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Morris/e/B001JS0KOS/\n(All books also available on Amazon.co.uk, and other Amazon online stores.)\nGabriel's spiritual website: http://www.kundalini-fire.com\nGabriel's adventure travel site: http://gabrieltraveler.com\n\n\nThe \"Precession of the Equinoxes\" Explained\u2014The 26,000-Year \"Great Year\" Cycle", "title": "The \"Precession of the Equinoxes\" Explained\u2014The 26,000-Year \"Great Year\" Cycle", "publishedDate": "2012-07-04T04:24:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BZnZcps3Fc", "description": "A man trapped in cave tries to escape as his body mutates in this exploration of death and rebirth through metamorphosis.\n\nFestival Screenings:\nAnime Caribe 2013 (Trinidad and Tobago)\nStoptrik 2013 (Poland)\nSitges Fantasy Film Festival 2013 (Catalonia)\nMaligno 2013 (Italy)\nAdobe First Frame 2014 (United States, Los Angeles)\nImagine Film Festival 2014 (Netherlands)\nX Fantaspoa 2014 (Brazil)\nGalactic Film Festival 2014 (United States, Los Angeles)\nFantastic Zagreb 2014 (Zagreb)", "title": "Metempsychosis", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T05:02:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BaG_N3gEwg", "description": "Thank you everyone who helped out writing/calling in to their state reps!  \n\nhttp://www.nohr669.com/ \n\n-EDIT-  SEPT. 2008-\nTHE FDA LIFTED THE BAN ON POUCHED RATS AS PETS IN THE UNITED STATES!!!  If ANYONE in the US still has them, I am VERY interested in two young pouched rats!  Either Emin's pouched OR Gambian pouched!  THANK YOU!!!\n\nMatisse is an emin's pouched rat, they are RELATED to gambian pouched rats, but are seperate species.  He is 4 years old as of 6/07, NOT neutered (vet turned me down back when I got him), and EXTREMELY affectionate.  That said, not everyone can or should handle an african pouched rat. They are not domestic animals and do not act like it, either.\n\nEDIT-  \nMatisse was an emin's pouched rat (Crycetomis emini), a smaller, sleeker relative of the gambian pouched rat (Crycetomis gambianus).  The emin's pouched rat has a longer snout, it's fur is very sleek and body is thin and longer.  They have a clear line of demarkation from it's dark brown upper body and it's greyish white belly.  The gambian rat has a short snout, a bulkier body, is a uniform greyish color, and a bit \"rougher\" looking fur.  My emin's pouched rat weighed about 4 lbs. at his peak, was SOLID muscle, made lots of \"churbling\" noises (almost like a parrot) and was very playful outside his cage.  He was extremely intelligent, scarily so, and figured things out instantly.  He was also VERY stubborn, and if he didn't want to do something, there was no way you could make him.  \n\nMatisse passed away Summer of 2007 at 4 years 2 months of age.  He died sleeping in his hammock... I was devastated.  \n\nHe was 4th generation captive bred, VERY affectionate, and very much bonded to me (although others could pet and handle him JUST FINE!).  \n\nalthough I had success with Matisse, they're not pets for everyone.  These guys are still wild animals, and unless you have experience with BOTH medium sized exotic animals as well as rats, I wouldn't recommend them. Pouchies are strong, destructive, and can do serious damage to a person if that person doesn't know what they're doing.  They can also chew through wire cage bars if they put their mind to it, and wires and cabinets are short work for those powerful teeth.", "title": "Emin's pouched rat, grapes", "publishedDate": "2006-08-09T15:40:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2BaRsNe065k", "description": "Interval training is the best way to lose weight fast.

Some workers nearer the ambulance, however, were helping the officers out.\n\nThe good samaritans were seen approaching the ambulance amidst the chaos and gestured for trapped paramedics and police officers onboard to flee.\n\nA police patrol car, which had been turned on its side, and positioned in front of the ambulance, was on fire. All this while a large group of people had gathered by the pavement, watching what was unfolding before them. Unseen mob participants can be heard throwing objects at the ambulance.\n\nThe paramedics and police officers are later seen running away from the burning vehicle and ambulance. As they do so, screams and shouts can be heard - some sound like cheering, others jeering.\n\nIf you know any of the men who approached the ambulance to help, we would like to hear from you.

Ouch.  I felt bad at first like max you are so stupid to miss these simple rules, what do I answer with.  But then I got a little pissed and decided I'd take a jab at. And sent her this\nwhile capitalists may capitalize on any given opportunity us Normal persons are not always punctual with their punctuation, Sometimes people miss periods, and baby let me tell you even if there are no question marks when your texting mark that question about his erections poor protection starts a sense of exasperation than needs no exclamation characters, you should know that he's in hysterics from the words he sends back.  I hate grammar Nazi gestapo flack and  I'm finally firing my attack.   I'm throwing hand grenades.  At grammar Nazis.  Split them into fragments, make them pay for their war crimes with run on life sentences  serve them elliptically like 3 times,  run on' s that seems to continue far beyond the purpose they were originally intended to describe like life inside a benign city void of meaning with confusion spinning swiftly wining with an arsenal and arson burning burning.   Chaos to the your parsing I'm crazy.  I'm sadistic, I'm here to pervert your lingustics More twisted than an and sign and I'm sick, Ive been subject to ebola , predicate a hospital for those languages broken  in a comma coma and now my colons swollen, dr. says he has to amputate; so soon a semicolons strolling in and if  I'm not quite sure If I would want my parents to see What I'm prepared to speak (I put my words inside parentheses ,  Besides this is offense because  communists don't believe in apostrophes, you know no possessions,  and maybe there is something wrong with me cause honestly quite possible\nI'd rather be an quasi- commie than a bossy patsy kamikaze in the grammar Nazi army.  Poems and Papers are meant to break your conventional one dimensional views, and not just with origami\nAfter all grammar is just pirate code, a guideline, language, and spelling have changed since the dawn of time, and if I'm in a concentration camp because I'm focused on the part of the prose that should be analyzed, not you're anal retentive emphasis on the antitheses of the purpose of writing lines.  So stop brandishing your crossed question marks  because I find that shit offensive, stop checking for writers un crossed tee's and dot less I's and use yours to pay attention to the message\nAnd if you guys have been Nazis in the past I'm not mad a bit just be a language activist switch to being grammar pacifists, don't look back and wish you'd acted better because trying to undo the past is like putting a scratch through an Asterix.

For example, desertification of topsoil and compactification of subsurface soil produces mechanical barriers to root growth and challenge the ability of plants to find nutrient resources. To explore how plants respond to these growth conditions, we developed a model system consisting of a 3D layered hydrogel. The hydrogel has two layers: A stiff lower layer and a compliant upper layer. Medicago truncatula plants were then planted in the top gel and their growth over the next 100 hours was monitored. Remarkably, we find that Medicago roots developed a helical morphology just above the gel/gel interface before penetrating into the stiff lower layer. \n\nTo study root growth, we developed a 3D time-lapse imaging stage that allows us observe growth dynamics and allow us to quantify root structure. In essence, our apparatus combines a laser sheet, a translating stage, and a digital camera to scan the region of root growth and record a series of images that are reconstructed on a computer. Using this automated system, we were able to directly observe obstructed root growth and the formation of the buckled root morphology. The time-lapse movie shown here illustrates a the helical buckling of plant roots that was the main focus of our original study.", "title": "Helical buckling of plant roots", "publishedDate": "2012-09-24T13:10:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2C7mNr5WMjA", "description": "\"The Log Song\", from Ren & Stimpy\n\n \n\nWhat rolls down stairs alone or in pairs\nRolls over your neighbor's dog?\nWhat's great for a snack and fits on your back?\nIt's Log, Log, Log!\n\n\nIt's Log, Log, it's big, it's heavy, it's wood.\nIt's Log, Log, it's better than bad, it's good!\nEveryone wants a log!

She had an extraordinary vocal range and could produce unusually high notes.\n \n   Known as \"Lark Ellen\" or \"The California Nightingale,\" she was reportedly the only known soprano of her era who could sing AND SUSTAIN the D above high D. She was also able to trill in major thirds or fifths!\n  \n   The Edison Diamond Disc---posted here--- of her vocal composition, \"The Skylark,\" has always been a prized find for record collectors, as she does indeed trill on 3rds and 5ths...and the song ends with the highest note ever recorded during the acoustic-record days....prior to 1925.\n\n   What makes this disc so \"rare\" is that it was in the Edison catalog for little more than a year. The master burned in the Edison fire of 1914 and was never redone. Secondly, the discs themselves have become unstable \nand break apart from their thick core, rendering them all but unplayable.  The number of surviving good copies is dwindling.  In spite of every precaution, my copy, which was \"new\" when I acquired it, continues to deteriorate.  It's maddening!\n\n   Yaw was born in the small town of \nBoston, near Buffalo, New York. Her family moved to Los Angeles when she was very young.  Her father died when she was yet a child.  The family was poor. \n    Yaw began singing and composing \nsongs as a child. Her first vocal lessons were from her mother.   Yaw \nsang in concerts, beginning as a child \nin the 1880s, to make money to pay for\n singing lessons. Tours of the southern U.S., California, England, Switzerland, and Germany followed---and on her return to the U.S. she gave a concert in Carnegie Hall in 1896. \n   Yaw raised enough money to study \nin Paris with Mathilde Marchesi, the \nteacher of virtually every really famous and well-trained coloratura soprano years ago.   \n   In 1899, Yaw was singing in private \nconcerts in London, and at one of these, she so impressed Sir Arthur Sullivan that he prevailed upon the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to cast her as the Sultana Zubedyah in his comic opera, \"The Rose of Persia,\" which \nopened on November 29, 1899, at the Savoy Theatre in London. \n    Sullivan went so far as to write a special high cadenza for her song, \"'Neath My Lattice,\" a cadenza only she could sing. \n   While it's a long and complicated story, Yaw soon was sacked! It's said that she was so beautiful that Sullivan's and Carte's wives wanted her gone. \n   Yaw then made some grand operatic \nappearances in Monte Carlo, including \nOphelia in Thomas' Hamlet in 1902 (her \nfavorite role)---and in Rome, where she sang the title role in Lucia,  in 1905. \n   Yaw sang Gilda in Rigoletto in London in 1905-- and gave a single performance of Lucia at New York's Metropolitan Opera--on March 21, 1908--after which she was described by the Met's manager as \"the world's greatest coloratura soprano.\"  Her potential Met rivals saw to it that she \nnever sang there again!\n   Yaw sang a total of 18 operatic roles. However, she mostly devoted herself to the concert hall, where she had a long and successful career.  \n   In 1904, the Los Angeles Daily Times wrote, \"Miss Yaw's voice is high soprano of crystalline lightness and purity and of a range so extreme in altitude that it was the wonder \nof the European continent.\"\n   Yaw was much in demand as a recording artist, and her first discs were made in May 1899.  She made a number of recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company.  Those who hear these today conclude that her Victor discs do little justice to her \ntrue vocal talents.   \n   In order to display her voice to its best effect, she wrote  several songs of her own---\"The Skylark,\" \"The Cuckoo,\" and \"The Firefly.\" \n    Yaw resided in Covina, California, the last thirty years of her life. She taught singing, gave concerts, and devoted herself to charitable pursuits.  Often her concerts were in aid of these charities.\n \n   Yaw is memorialized in Covina by Lark Ellen Elementary School and Lark Ellen Avenue, one of the main \nthoroughfares in Covina.  Yaw died there, just shy of her 78th birthday.", "title": "coloratura Ellen Beach Yaw \"Skylark\" -highest voice recorded", "publishedDate": "2008-02-21T04:10:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2C8_I57124o", "description": "Marielle de Sarnez dans #DirectPolitique", "title": "Marielle de Sarnez - Aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 : \"Opposer bonne gestion et croissance, \u00e7a n'a aucun sens\"", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T17:22:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2C8sLlnl8h8", "description": "Pok\u00e9mon XY Special: The Strongest Mega Evolution ~ Act IlI ~ 9\n\n\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fcXY\u7279\u5225\u7de8 \u6700\u5f37\u30e1\u30ac\u30b7\u30f3\u30ab \uff5eAct \u2160\u2160\u2160 9\n\n\u270eSubscribe\u279c\u279c\u279c\u279c\u279c\u279c\u279c\u279c https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGaf2eOqzGtlSeupxNROxug?annotation_id=annotation_4239725605&feature=iv&src_vid=SgeUBmbYjWg&sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2704+google \u279c https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/104913758275394319482/104913758275394319482/posts\n\n\u06e9 Facebook \u279c https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ah-X/283554101803288?ref=hl", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon XY Special: The Strongest Mega Evolution ~ Act IlI ~ 9", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T10:33:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2C8uYiIcIF8", "description": "Do you remember the cover of the famous G\u00f6del-Escher-Bach written by Douglas R.

The aerodynamic instability of this arrangement increased agility but required the use of computerized fly-by-wire control. Composite materials were used to control the aeroelastic divergent twisting experienced by forward-swept wings, also reducing the weight. Developed by Grumman, the X-29 first flew in 1984 and two X-29s were flight tested over the next decade...\n\nDesign and development\n\nTwo X-29As were built by Grumman from two existing Northrop F-5A Freedom Fighter airframes (63-8372 became 82-0003 and 65-10573 became 82-0049) after the proposal had been chosen over a competing one involving a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The X-29 design made use of the forward fuselage and nose landing gear from the F-5As with the control surface actuators and main landing gear from the F-16. The technological advancement that made the X-29 a plausible design was the use of carbon-fiber composites. The wings of the X-29, made partly of graphite epoxy, were swept at more than 33 degrees forward. The Grumman internal designation for the X-29 was \"Grumman Model 712\" or \"G-712\".\n\nThe X-29A demonstrated high maneuvering and control in flight testing. A maximum angle of attack of 67\u00b0 was reached. The configuration, combined with a center of gravity well aft of the aerodynamic center, made the craft inherently unstable. Stability was provided by the computerized flight control system making 40 corrections per second. The flight control system was made up of three redundant digital computers backed up by three redundant analog computers; any of the three could fly it on its own, but the redundancy allowed them to check for errors. Each of the three would \"vote\" on their measurements, so that if any one was malfunctioning it could be detected. It was estimated that a total failure of the system was as unlikely as a mechanical failure in an airplane with a conventional arrangement.\n\nAeroelastic considerations\n\nIn a forward swept wing configuration, the aerodynamic lift produces a twisting force which rotates the wing leading edge upward. This results in a higher angle of attack, which increases lift, twisting the wing further. This aeroelastic divergence can quickly lead to structural failure. With conventional metallic construction, a torsionally very stiff wing would be required to resist twisting; stiffening the wing adds weight, which may make the design unfeasible.\n\nThe X-29 design made use of the anisotropic elastic coupling between bending and twisting of the carbon fiber composite material to address this aeroelastic effect. Rather than using a very stiff wing, which would carry a weight penalty even with the relatively light-weight composite, the X-29 used a laminate which produced coupling between bending and torsion. As lift increases, bending loads force the wing tips to bend upward. Torsion loads attempt to twist the wing to higher angles of attack, but the coupling resists the loads, twisting the leading edge downward reducing wing angle of attack and lift. With lift reduced, the loads are reduced and divergence is avoided.\n\nOperational history\n\nThe first X-29 was taken aloft on 14 December 1984 from Edwards AFB with Grumman's Chief Test Pilot Chuck Sewell at the controls. With that flight, the X-29 became the second jet-powered aircraft to fly with forward swept wings (with the Nazi Germany-era Junkers Ju 287, which first flew in 1944, being the first)...

As much as I love Toronto, I occasionally need to get out into the country and enjoy the beauty and serenity of Ontario's rural areas. So at 9 am I met my friend Karel who is a local expert of the area and we set off on a discovery of Halton Region Conservation areas: we started with Mount Nemo Conservation Area, stopped in Lowville, and then admired the Iroquois longhouses in Crawford Lake. After a brief stop in the Hilton Falls Conservation Area we explored the Victorian-era Main Street of Milton as well as its scenic Mill Pond.\n\nFrom here we drove on towards the Spencer Gorge Conservation Area where we enjoyed the view of two waterfalls: Tew's Falls and Webster's Falls. We also hiked out to Dundas Peak, and the rocky platform with its sheer vertical drops provided a stunning view of Dundas and the City of Hamilton. I capped off my country tour with a leisurely drive along Lake Ontario's shoreline past the cities of Burlington, Oakville and Mississauge.

Four additional species from Madagascar in the subfamily Galidiinae, which were previously classified in this family, are also referred to as \"mongooses\" or \"mongoose-like\". Genetic evidence indicates the Galidiinae are more closely related to other Madagascar carnivorans in the family Eupleridae, which is the closest living group to the true mongooses\nThe word \"mongoose\" is derived from the Marathi name mungus (\u092e\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0942\u0938) (pronounced as [mu\u014b\u0261u\u02d0s]), perhaps ultimately from Dravidian (cf. Telugu mungeesa (\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c02\u0c17\u0c3f\u0c38), Kannada mungisi (\u0cae\u0cc1\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbf\u0cb8\u0cbf). The form of the English name (since 1698) was altered to its \"-goose\" ending by folk-etymology. It has no etymological connection with the word goose. The plural form is mongooses, or, rarely, mongeese.It has also been spelled \"mungoose\".\n\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e19 (\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29: Small asian mongoose, Small

Part of its appeal lies in the incredible variety of ingredients which in some cases can literally be deadly. \n\nTake for instance, the Puffer fish, considered a delicacy in China. It also happens to be one of the most poisonous vertebrates on this planet. They contain tetrodotoxin which according to National Geographic can be 1,200 times more poisonous than cyanide.  The amount of toxin in each puffer fish can kill 30 humans and oh by the way, no antidote is known. So not surprisingly, puffer fish has caught the attention of adventure foodies.\n\nCalled fugu in Asia, it is served in parts of China as well as Japan and Korea. Even though, only licensed chefs who know how to remove the toxin can serve a puffer fish, there are plenty of unauthorized/hidden places where you can consume it. \n\nAnd regardless of the circumstances, you are always at risk. The China Daily details a recent incident in which a diner in Jiangsu province experienced dizzyness and numbness in legs right after eating a puffer fish and only a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation from a fellow diner saved his life.\n\nWhile the exact numbers unknown, hundreds of people worldwide are said to die each year from puffer fish poisoning. Probably the biggest risk-takers are the chefs who are required to taste them before serving to diners.", "title": "Pufferfish Dining Dangers", "publishedDate": "2012-04-17T11:14:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2DN0kxW4bbQ", "description": "http://www.spokenview-shop.com\nAlbum: Omnipotenz in D-Moll (2008)\nKaufen und so!", "title": "Morlockk Dilemma - 11.09.

It often causes itching. It has been well established that keratinocytes play a key role in the expression and generation of immunological reactions during dandruff formation.

However, it provides plenty of confidential information about prop making, which is a great money saver for you!\n\nIn this DVD, for the very first time Hondo disclosed how to make the best linking rubber bands in the worlds. (The quality is exactly the same as the ones provided in Hondo's Infinitum DVD.) After mastering this method, you can customize your own linking rubber bands with the tools supplied in the Drunk package. Thus you don't need to worry about giving away the linking rubber bands as a souvenir, and it lowers the cost for the performance. Besides, this method can be applied to any linkable objects such as rings, earrings, and scissors. The only limit is your imagination.\n\nAnother feature is Hondo's own marked deck system. Hondo will teach you how to make a one-way marked deck with easy-reading marks. Your own deck of cards will turn into a powerful tool for magic in no time. The marking system exceeds others in its camouflage, easy and quick reading, non-fading, and no stains at all.\n\nAlong with the above secrets, you'll also have the access to:\n\uff0a How to tie the knot of the invisible elastic band fast and correctly\n\uff0a How to make linking Polo Mints without visible connection\n\uff0a How to find the cheap roughing fluid and the tips of applying\n\uff0a How to make a Svengali deck or others like a stripper deck with precision\n\nNowadays, in a world with tons of magic products, it's an inevitable subject for every magician to decide how to spend the money efficiently. This Drunk DVD doesn't come for free, but it'll help you save more and more to invest on other magic. Yet, the origin of this project is to inspire all the viewers, all the fellow magicians, with the knowledge provided, to create your own magic!\n\nPS: There is a hidden chapter in somewhere of the DVD menu.

It was so much pain; this is what I hate about flying. I never get used to the popping. It was like my ears were getting ready to fall off the sides of my head! When the plane landed, I held my ears and tried not to cry. Vic noticed and helped me through it. She took out the ear drops and put them in my ears. I'm the only one she uses it on; the others are used to the popping. We collected our luggage and headed to our hotel. All we did was set our luggage in our rooms, ate some breakfast, and rested until 5pm. Our manager, David, woke us up and took us to the arena that the concert will be held. I quickly changed into this: http://www.polyvore.com/krystal_outfit/template?id=354459 \nWe drove over to the arena and quickly rehearsed the songs and dance routines. It was 7:30 by the time we finished. We were pushed to hair, makeup, and wardrobe. The arena filled with thousands of fans chanting our names. I took a deep breath and walked to my place on stage. The lights flashed on and the stage was lit and our fans were going crazy. \nHarry's POV\nwe drove to the arena where the concert was being held. Louis was talking about he was looking forward to the concert and thinking about going backstage to meet the group in person. I wasn't sure about anything right now, I've never heard of this group and I'm expected to go see them preform live. When we arrived, girls saw that we were here and ran over to us. We were able to make our way to the front and get in. Luckily, the security guards had teenage daughters. They let us in with no questions. Louis forced us to get close up front, it was dark. Bright lights lit up the whole arena and five girls stood on stage in the cutest clothes you'll ever see a girl wear. Music started to play and one by one they started singing and dancing (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euEUR_kYABI). The one with the blue pants caught my eye. She was full of energy and had an amazing voice. The way she flipped her long, dark brown hair was cute. Her smile kept me smiling, and the way she moved her flawless figure to the beat was attractive. I could hear Louis fangirling...erm...fanboying, I guess? He screamed out their names. I'm thinking of using Louis' love for them as a one way ticket to meeting them. When the concert was over, after them singing 9 more songs, we were leaving. I taped on Louis' shoulder, \n\"Aren't you going backstage?\" I asked. He shook his head no. \n\"The girls are tired. Besides, I can't go alone.\" He replied. I stood there,\n\"I can go with you. I know how much you love them so...I can meet them with you, you know.\" I offered. He looked at me with a smirk on his face, \n\"You fancy one of them, don't you? Come on...tell me!\" he figured out, I blushed.\n\"The one with the long dark brown hair and gorgeous smile,\" I replied looking at the ground. \n\"Krystal? No problem, Tommo the match maker is here. You got me my Eleanor, now I'm going to get you your Krystal.\" He said and pulled me to the security guards guarding the backstage entrance. We stood face to face with the two large guards.\n \"Hello, I'm Louis Tomlinson and this is Harry Styles. We are in the band One Direction. We were wondering if we could meet the girls of F(x) backstage.\" Louis said with no fear guards looked at each other then back down to us. They stepped aside to let us through\n\"Thank You!\" Louis called while we ran through. It wasn't hard to find the girls. Louis quickly spotted one of them and pulled me to her.

Conducting more than 200 crash tests a year and continually introducing numerous technical developments, CYBEX clearly gives safety top priority. CYBEX clearly gives safety top priority.  This explains why the current child safety seats from CYBEX score only good or very good results in the most important European safety and consumer tests.\n\nDOUBLE SAFETY\n\nAs a Group I seat with safety pillow the CYBEX Pallas-fix offers enhanced safety compared to conventional five-point harness systems. A simple conversion turns the Group I seat into the award winning Group II/III seat CYBEX Solution X2-fix. Similar to a side airbag the new side protection pads absorb the energy of a collision at an early stage, further improving side impact protection.\n\n2 SEATS IN ONE\n\nIn Group I, the CYBEX Pallas 2-fix features a new safety cushion system and as a 2-in-1 seat offers extremely long usability of approximately 11 years. The seat converts easily at the age of approximately 3 years (15 kg) into the CYBEX Solution X2-fix (Group II/III). The ISOFIX Connect System offers enhanced safety and greater stability in both groups.\n\nADJUSTABLE SAFETY CUSHION FOR MAXIMUM PROTECTION\n\nThe newly designed safety cushion adjusts forwards and backwards and offers more freedom of movement of the upper body as well as maximum safety especially in front impacts when compared to conventional five-point harness systems. The forces of a collision are distributed over the safety cushion and reduced by its impact absorbing materials. This system resembles a blown up airbag and helps to reduce the forces significantly in case of an accident. The belt does not injure the child while at the same time his or her sensitive neck and shoulder area is protected.\n\nCOMFORTABLE RECLINE FUNCTION\n\nIn Group I the Pallas-fix child seat features an easy to operate recline function which can be operated with only one hand from the front of the seat.\n\nLINEAR SIDE IMPACT PROTECTION (L.S.P. SYSTEM)\n\nIn the further improved L.S.P. System (Linear.Side-impact.Protection) of the Pallas 2-fix the forces of a side impact collision are systematically absorbed in a linear series of reactions including the protective pillow, the side as well as head protectors. At the same time the body's kinetic energy caused by the impact is absorbed at a very early stage and the head is actively led into a safe position.\n\nISOFIX CONNECT\n\nThe ISOFIX Connect system offers enhanced safety and greater stability in both groups.  The seat's connectors simply snap into the vehicle's ISOFIX anchorage points. The connectors can be easily folded away making the seat compatible also with cars not equipped with ISOFIX.\n\nCar compatibility check:\n\nhttp://cybex-online.com/site/uk/carseats/pallas2-fix/type-list.html", "title": "CYBEX PALLAS 2-FIX - A MATTER OF TRUST", "publishedDate": "2011-08-03T09:52:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2DiuDMZgEeU", "description": "More @ http://www.myhotelvideo.com/de/landingpage/youtube/resourceid/Mhv_Catalog_Offer::3  \nLage:\nDas attraktive Hotel liegt am Ufer des Nils und bietet seinen G\u00e4sten einen wundersch\u00f6nen Blick auf die Insel Elephantine.

Find out more at http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/la-bayadere-by-natalia-makarova\n\nRead the news feature - http://www.roh.org.uk/news/watch-nehemiah-kish-on-la-bayadere\n\nMarius Petipa's exotic La Bayad\u00e8re was given its premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre in St Petersburg in 1877. It was regularly performed within the former Soviet Union throughout the 20th century but was almost unknown in the West until 1961, when the touring Kirov Ballet performed the famous Kingdom of the Shades scene. Natalia Makarova saw the ballet as a child in Leningrad and created this version for American Ballet Theatre in 1980.\n\nLegendary India provides the setting for a tale of love, murder and vengeful judgement by the gods, set to a lyrical score by Ludwig Minkus. The choreography provides powerful moments for the two opposing ballerinas -- the beautiful temple dancer, Nikiya, and her jealous rival, Gamzatti -- while a bronze idol comes vividly to life in a stunning solo. La Bayad\u00e8re's most frequently performed sequence is the dream-like Kingdom of the Shades, when a mesmerizing procession of ballerinas dance in unison across a moonlit stage. Opulent designs by Yolanda Sonnabend perfectly fit the ballet's fevered exoticism.", "title": "Nehemiah Kish and Hikaru Kobayashi in rehearsals for La Bayad\u00e8re (The Royal Ballet)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T12:23:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "2DkQh2uTF-E", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/mohamedamine.elmehni\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AmineGuitar PAGE OFFICIELLE \nsalut , Pour la Premi\u00e8re fois un Cover oriental , j'esp\u00e8re que \u00e7a va vous plaire , donnez moi votre avis  partagez au MAX et pour plus de videos visitez ma Page Officielle", "title": "Amine El Mehni - Mamnounak Ana - Melhem Zein  by Mohcine Mehni", "publishedDate": "2014-03-09T00:23:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Dkknl-t7Hs", "description": "Our first look at the official hard shell case for the HTC One", "title": "Official HTC One hard shell case hands-on", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T15:43:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2DlNVa6sr5E", "description": "Short clip from \"Cry of the Penguins\".", "title": "Adelie Penguin Belly Bopping", "publishedDate": "2006-09-01T19:55:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2DlWAacQJQQ", "description": "Photos - landscapes of Evenkia (Eastern Siberia).

One of the most urgent and poignant problems in Tanzania is the abandonment of very young babies and children, either through the parent's lack of resources or as a result of the increasing problem of HIV-AIDS and Malaria. Moved by this daunting fact and their love for children Francesca Aimone and Jutta Kassam (two Tanzanian residence) launched into voluntary work with various local orphanages.\n\nSeeing the overwhelming need they soon hatched a plan to launch their own sheltered home. Building on their locally gained experience, Francesca and Jutta founded Malaika Children's Home in December 2004. Malaika is located in Moshono (8km from Arusha).\n\nIt now cares for children, from a few months old onwards, neglected by their families and left to fend for themselves or worse. Malaika provides the children with schooling; medical attention and most importantly LOVE -- in a stable and loving, home environment. All Malaika personnel, including 'House Mothers,' Nurses, Teachers and the office coordinators are hand picked locally, encouraging awareness as well as offering employment, regular training and professional development within the local community.\n\nMalaika (meaning Angel in Swahili) currently cares for children assigned them by Tanzania's Social Services. Malaika's warmth and vibrancy is reflected in the faces of all the children -- full of bubbling affection and newfound confidence. They simply love welcoming and interacting with visitors. Their infectious laughter and personalities will leave you with a warm glow and an unforgettable memory.\n\nMalaika is supported in Italy by MAISHA, an NGO started in 2005, in Padua. Through our close relationship with Maisha we have started a program through which everyone can contribute to help our children have a better future.\n\nThere are many foundations helping children in Africa. But the difference is that our priority above all, IS TO LISTEN. We don't want just to help; we want to listen, learn and contribute to an African way of life, full of its own traditions and wisdom, which is huge part of our children's heritage.\n\nCultural colonialism and paternalism of \"Third world aids\" are unknown to us. A two-way relationship of communication and teaching/learning IS OUR FOCUS. It is extremely important to us to closely follow our children growing up, so we can learn to look though their eyes. To see the dreams and the hopes they have in their little hearts.\n\nWe too have a dream, that they can become free and independent individuals in their own right in their own country, rather than being labeled as \"helped\" people.\n\nWe pay great attention to how they grow up day by day, respecting their culture and their country, whilst also inspiring enthusiasm in their lives, and a newborn confidence and a smile.\n\nWhat drives us is the knowledge that there is nothing more important in life than to 'GIVE HOPE' and above all to give love to these children -- who previously only knew abandonment and desperation since their early years or first moments.\n\nFor these reasons alone please help our cause and be a part of a new free and promising world.\n\nTALK ABOUT MALAIKA\n\nYour voice is our pedestal. Talk about Malaika to everyone you know and ignite a chain reaction. SHARE OUR DREAM WITH OTHERS. Our biggest strength is through every visitor to our site talking ABOUT US. Your word of mouth is our strength and future.

I didn't want to just \"remake\" the video, so I had to think how I was going to take the video that everyone loved, and add something to it. I don't even know how I come up with the idea, but pretty soon, I was making plans to go to Arizona and make it snow. I was going to do it in Utah, but we get so much snow here, it's not even funny. I knew going to a place where it never snowed, would make it and even better video. With the help of some friends (Miles from \"Totally Rad\", Spencer Edge, Breea, and Corey Crowfoot) we packed up my car and took the 11 hour road trip to Arizona State University. To our surprise (and fortune) we were there the same weekend as a big ASU football game. That helped, cause that gave us more people to talk to. We met up with Christian from \"Right This Minute\" while we were down there. She heard we were coming and said she would love to help out. \nThis video now makes it on the top of my all time favorite videos. The reactions are priceless, and so unique. I love how you can see the snow coming before the person can, so it makes you feel like you are really part of the prank. Making it snow was so hard. We had to pray really hard every time, and ask for it...just kidding...we had a snow machine. We tested out a bunch of different methods and the snow machine was the best.\nThank you so much for watching my videos and helping me follow my dreams.

Bush took the Ice Bucket Challenge, and challenged former President Bill Clinton to do it next.\n\nThe viral Ice Bucket Challenge campaign has raised more than $40 million for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, to the ALS Association, which will go toward finding treatments and a cure for ALS as well as for providing support to people with the disease.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. ALS attacks the motor neurons that provide voluntary movements and muscle power, according to the ALS Association.\n\nThe exact cause of ALS has not yet been determined but glutamate poisoning is a popular theory suggested by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Glutamate is an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter, allowing motor neurons to communicate with one another. Glutamate is supposed to be cleaned by a cell membrane protein after transmitting a message. Researchers suggest ALS patients don\u2019t have enough of that protein. \n\nGlutamate clogs the space between the nerve endings, causing motor neurons to degenerate over time. As motor neurons degenerate, they can no longer send impulses to the muscle fibers, causing muscles to atrophy.\n\nInitial symptoms of ALS often include increasing muscle weakness, especially the arms and legs. Patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.\n\nThis animation explains how ALS affects the human body.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.
