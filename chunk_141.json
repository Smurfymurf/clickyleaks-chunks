Herve Wattine (France) was first at the windward mark with Mrs. Keiko Nogami (Japan) round second. Colclough was about 7th at the windward mark and sailed into the lead on the first tight reach. The second beat was very close with Nogami round first, but Colclough got past on the run and held on to finish first. Nogami was second and Saito third.\n\nAlthough Blatchford did not finish well, he confirmed second place overall while Colclough moved up to third after winning the last two races.\n\nI think all the competitors agreed that this was a well organised and fair regatta which managed to hold all races to schedule. It was also held over a wide range of wind and sea conditions viz. Force 1/7 and flat to very lumpy seas - which meant it did not bias the results towards the 'one condition' expert.\n\nWhat was clear was that the Australians were dominating five boats in the top eight positions - though it has to be said they sent the strongest team from the outset. Their whole approach to fast 505 sailing is very different from British or American methodology. In essence, they all use balsa-built Kyrwood hulls with spinnaker chutes and back-tacked jibs. They have very simple internal lay-outs with few 'strings', no shroud adjustments, no struts, light and flexible (mainly) Goldspar 1.7mm masts set with full luff round (mainly) Horizon/One Design sails, jib barber haulers which move out board and up following the forward thwart and no gybing centreboards. The main rig adjustment is the forestay led back to the helmsman - it is now no longer necessary for the crew to dive under the foredeck to alter the rig!\n\nIn light wind conditions they have medium rig tension and as the wind increases they simply let off the forestay progressively and move the barber haulers outboard. This results in excessive rake (by UK standards), very loose rigging and a lot of low down mast bend. The mast and sails work together to produce very competitive upwind performance in a majority of wind conditions, although it was noticeable that Peter Colclough won the last 2 races in lighter wind strengths.\n\nThe shore side and, in particular, the social side were well organised by the Japanese. The fleet was treated to three excellent parties (one with a magnificent firework display especially put on for the 505s) and often informal arrangements were made to meet in nearby restaurants. The camaraderie and friendliness amongst the fleet was an outstanding feature of the regatta - probably the best in recent years. In this spirit, Paul Elvstrom, who finished twelth overall, was heard to comment that he did not feel his age was a disadvantage merely that he had not practised enough!\nhttp://biphome.spray.se/505sweden/japan85e.htm", "title": "505 Worlds, Enoshima/Japan in 1985 - Race 6", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11T00:19:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7t6YZQG_nMg", "description": "http://tripwow.tripadvisor.com/tripwow/ta-00be-0a2a-cf51?ytv5=1 The best pictures of Labuanbajo taken by travel bloggers at TravelPod.com the web's premier travel blogging platform.

After a banana pancake breakfast, we break camp and putt up the coast of Komodo, past the village to the Park HQ. I'm ferried ashore where I pay the entry fee and get given a guide. I wish I could remember his name, he was pretty good. We set out on a 4km walk, and not far in we see a great monster of a dragon on the path ahead of us. He takes off quickly, so powerful and muscular, and so unlike the slovenly, lazy creatures you see at zoos, that it instantly redefines my understanding of them. I begin to wonder if going out into the scrub with a man armed only with a forked stick is such a good idea! We see no more dragons on the walk, but we do see drongos, friar birds, orange-footed scrub fowl (\"\" ...\n\n- \"The perfect shot!\" by Chibisimo from a blog titled \"Eden Beach ^^\"\nExcerpt: \"From Moni we had to go through more endless bus journeys.

At this time the tilt of the Earth's axis is inclined neither away from nor towards the Sun. The term equinox can also be used in a broader sense, meaning the date when such a passage happens. The name \"equinox\" is derived from the Latin aequus (equal) and nox (night), because around the equinox, night and day are about equal length.\nAt an equinox the Sun is at one of two opposite points on the celestial sphere where the celestial equator (i.e. declination 0) and ecliptic intersect. These points of intersection are called equinoctial points: classically, the vernal point (RA = 00h 00m 00s and longitude = 0\u00ba) and the autumnal point (RA = 12h 00m 00s and longitude = 180\u00ba). By extension, the term equinox may denote an equinoctial point.\nThe equinoxes are the only times when the subsolar point (the place on Earth's surface where the center of the Sun is exactly overhead) is on the Equator. The subsolar point crosses the Equator moving northward at the March equinox and moving southward at the September equinox. (Since the sun's ecliptic latitude isn't exactly zero it is not exactly above the equator at the moment of the equinox, but the two events usually occur less than 30 seconds apart.)\nThe equinoxes are the only times when the terminator is perpendicular to Earth's equator. Thus the Northern and Southern hemispheres are illuminated equally. (At the solstices, that angle reaches its minimum of 66.5\u00b0, corresponding to 90\u00b0 minus Earth's axial tilt).\nAnother meaning of equinox is the date when day and night are the same length. The equinox is not exactly the same as the day when day and night are of equal length for two reasons. Firstly, because of the size of the sun, the top of the disk rises above the horizon (constituting 'sunrise' which is the start of 'daytime') when the center of the disk is still below the horizon. Secondly, Earth's atmosphere refracts sunlight which means that an observer can experience light (daytime) even before the first glimpse of the sun's disk has risen above the horizon. To avoid this ambiguity the term equilux is sometimes used in this sense.[4][note 1] Times of sunset and sunrise vary with an observer's location (longitude and latitude), so the dates when day and night are of exactly equal length likewise depend on location. For places near the equator the daytime is always longer than the night, so they would never experience an equinox by this definition.", "title": "March Equinox  - Spring Equinox - Enjoy guys !", "publishedDate": "2014-03-15T20:32:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "7tDo4SI2440", "description": "Filmada no Parque Ecol\u00f3gico Mangal das Gar\u00e7as / Filmed in the Park Ecological Mangal das Garcas", "title": "Borboleta J\u00falia no Par\u00e1 (Butterfly Dryas Iulia in Brazil)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-17T13:21:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "7tE4Qlsa4q8", "description": "BURQA. 2013.\nLIKE US: https://www.facebook.com/unitedgaga", "title": "Lady Gaga - Burqa (Remix)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-17T20:12:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "7tEU-qKPGOg", "description": "In the middle of the country's methamphetamine epidemic, Highland Pharmaceuticals in Missouri has created a way to prevent pseudoephedrine from being ground into powder.

Wilt Chamberlain worked there as a bellhop.

She made sure people felt that they were pretty special.\"\n\nBorn Helen Wasser on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, she first came to the Kutsher's at age 10 after her mother's death.

As with all members of the genus, the jaguar cichlid is a large, aggressive and territorial member of the cichlidae. All members of the Parachromis are visually alike, and can only be identified by minor differences in apperiance. The Jaguar cichlid is a large, robust cichlid, displaying a shade of yellow/bronze throughout the body. This yellow colouration is then scattered with vivid black spots which are seen all along the flanks and gill plates. A series of several large black dots then run horizontally along the lateral line area.The fins are often a dark to black colouration, especially when in spawning colouration.\n\nThe female is similarly colored, but generally smaller than the male. The female will also lack the elongated extensions to the dorsal fins.\n\nThe Parachromis managuensis is capable of reaching 13\" (330 mm) in length with the female slightly smaller than the male, reaching lengths of about 9--10\" (230--250 mm).

Luna is a \"wholesaler\" of experiences life can offer. He is a LIFE traveler, and a self-transformer in the physical and spiritual aspects of life. When he was five months old, he was given for adoption because his parents didn't have the means to raise him. During his childhood, his biological parents separated. Having been raised with different sets of values, beliefs and attitudes by different sets of parents inspired him to write his experiences as a child and came with a topic on \"Child-ing the Parent, Parenting the Child.\" Having been exposed to different adversities in life, he grew up angry toward the world. This inspired him, in 1999, develop a topic on anger management. Here, people share experiences on the negative impact of anger in a person's health, wealth, relationships, and connections, including its ill effects on physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. The objective is to learn to control, manage, and spiritually conquer anger. He was also a victim of sexual abuse when he was a child. This experience inspired him to create a presentation on \"Sexuality: Sex & Spirituality\" about relationships and real differences between sex and lust, lust and love, making love and having sex, rising and falling in love, and sexual intercourse as the last recourse. At young age, he learned to sell in order to survive, including an unsharpened pencil inside his notebook as fare for a bus ride home. He was also asked to sell a pencil during his very first interview when he applied for a job. For ten years, he was employed as a medical representative in different multinational pharmaceutical companies, despite his lack of a college diploma. His vast experience in selling inspired him to conceptualize a program on \"Harmonizing with Time and Nature.\" This is a sharing of experiences on how to align ourselves and our work with time and nature in order to work with the least effort but with maximum results. In 1983, June started a pharmaceutical marketing and distribution business, Metropharm, now, Prosel Pharma, Inc. From five people doing business in a garage, Prosel now employs 251 strong sales-force and administrative staff operating in the Philippines. His experience as a businessman inspired him to share his ideas about the topic \"Trusteeship in Business.\" This provides an overview on the principles of trusteeship based on the concept of humanity as one big family, with God as the parent. It also teaches the value of stewardship in life and in business by considering all wealth as common property of all children of God in the spirit of brotherhood, owners, investors, creditors, and workers as brothers. Triunephant is a story of a man whose significant matters in life came in sets of threes. It is a story of a man who transformed his negative experiences into success. If you want to know more about him and his life-changing and life-transforming topics and stories, visit his website www.juneluna.com.ph. His story will give you a tour of the drama, comedy, love story, and action movie of life. He has shared his story during the past eleven years with people from all walks of life including doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, businessmen, Rotarians, accountants, dentists, priests, nuns, seminarians, teachers, parents, and students, among others. They number to more than 26,000 already.

An active hunter, it prefers gastropods, crustaceans, and bivalves and will repeatedly smash its prey until it can gain access to the soft tissue for consumption. It is reported to have a \"punch\" of over 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). This is the fastest recorded punch of any living animal. The acceleration is similar to that in a .22 caliber handgun, with a force created of 200 pounds (91 kg) per strike. In addition, the surface of its appendages is made up of extremely dense hydroxyapatite, layered in a manner which is highly resistant to fracturing. Glass aquaria can be broken by them. The composition is being investigated for potential synthesis and engineering use.\nSome saltwater aquarists keep peacock mantis shrimp in captivity.[6] These aquarists may play a role in understanding the mysteries of the mantis shrimp. The peacock mantis is especially colorful and desired in the trade.\n\nWhile some aquarists value peacock shrimp, others consider them harmful pests, because they:\n\n Are voracious predators, eating other desirable inhabitants of the tank,\n  -  Can, in some of the largest specimens, break aquarium glass by striking it\n   - Can do more damage burrowing in live rock than the fishkeeper would prefer\n\nThe live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It is not uncommon for a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish, and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks, it should be noted that whilst stomatopods do not eat coral the smashers can damage it if they wish to make a home within it.\n\nTemperature:  73.4 \u00b0F - 84.2 \u00b0F (23\u00b0C - 29\u00b0C)\nFeeding:  Brine Schrimps, Clam Meat, Crabs, Fish (little Fishes), Flakes, Frozen Food (large sort), Krill, Schrimps, Shrimps, Smelts\nTank:  22 gal (~ 100L)", "title": "Odontodactylus scyllarus - Peacock Mantis Shrimp have a Snack ^^ (1080p)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-22T22:21:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7tSRXgc5YcM", "description": "10/4/87: Reggie Jackson records a single in his final at-bat in the Major Leagues\n\nCheck out http://MLB.com/video for more!\n\nAbout MLB.com: About MLB.com: Baseball Commissioner Allan H.

More on that following the intro song, during which you should check out the focus words!\n\nThis lesson covers quite a variety of words and rather than try to provide a summary of the entire lesson now, it would probably be better to just jump right into the lesson. So here it goes!\n\nThe first focus word for this lesson is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c means to pronounce, to say, or to utter. The perfective form of \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 and the sample sentence for \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c is as follows:\n\u042f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0437.\n(I'll say the sentence one more time.)\n\nFocus word number two is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c and \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c means to go on, to continue, or to keep doing something. It should be noted that the perfective form of \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c. In any case, the sample sentence for \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c goes like this:\n\u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u043b \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430.\n(He continued to talk for two hours.)\n\nThe third focus word is \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c means to solve or to decide. It should be noted that \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c  is the perfective form of \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c, BTW. Also used in the sample sentence is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c which means to try and \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 which means problem. Throwing these words into a sentence we derive:\n\u042f \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u044e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0443.\n(I'll try to solve this problem.)\n\nMoving along we have \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c in the imperfective and \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c in the perfective which mean to send. Interestingly, the conjugation for the future forms of \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c include: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u044e, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0451\u0448\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0451\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0451\u043c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u0451\u0442\u0435, and \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u044e\u0442. In any case, the sample sentence for \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c and \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c goes like this:\n\u042f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u044e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e.\n(I'll send you all that you need.)\n\nAnd finally we have \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f in the imperfective and \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f in the perfective which mean to listen to something. Another useful word which is used in the sample sentence is \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 and \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 means advice. Along with a couple other short words, the sample sentence goes like this:\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044f \u043a \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c.\n(Listen to his advice.)\n\nAnd now for a couple bonus sentences:\n\u041e\u043d \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442.\n(He knows what he's talking about.)\n\u042f \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043a \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e.\n(I'll certainly take your opinion into consideration.)\n\nThe focus words for this lesson include:\n\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c (to pronounce)\n\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c (to continue)\n\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c (to send)\n\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f (to listen to)\n\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c (to solve)", "title": "Speaking Russian 11 - \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T21:10:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7tlSeDHroMo", "description": "Get the FREE single \"Zone Out\" http://bit.ly/A4rjkP\n\nGod is so wonderful, so beautiful, so majestic, so amazingly exalted that to truly gaze upon Him is to be changed forever ( 2 Cor 3:18). \n\nJustin Martyr, an early church apologist, said,\"They can kill us, but they can't hurt us.\"   This simply means that no matter what happens to the person that has zoned out, his life and hope are always out of reach of true danger.

It was serialized in the semi-monthly Japanese magazine Hana to Yume, published by Hakusensha, from 1999 to 2006. The series was also adapted into a 26-episode anime series, directed by Akitaro Daichi.\n\nThe word \"Fruits\" in the title is always plural; the spelling originates from the transcription of the English word \"fruit\" into Japanese, where because there is no \"tu\" sound, \"tsu\" is used instead. The title comes from the name of a popular game played in Japanese elementary schools, which is alluded to in the series.\n\nThe name spellings used in this article correspond to those given in the official Region 1 DVD and English manga releases.

The Russell terrier drew a cheer when it made the initial cut in the terrier group.\n\nThe old English sheepdog was clearly a crowd favorite. Maybe that's because fans knew his backstory -- this was just the fourth dog show Swagger had ever entered.\n\nIn fact, Swagger didn't even come to Westminster as a champion. In past years, only dogs who had won a lot in the past were eligible. This time, with a larger exhibition space along the Hudson River during the day, more dogs were allowed.\n\nCertainly, it was worth the $75 entry cost for Swagger's owners.\n\nBanana Joe, meanwhile, gets no prize money for winning Westminster. Instead, along with the silver bowl, the Garden champion earns a lifetime of prestige, plus lucrative breeding fees for its owners.\n\nThe Portuguese water dog -- the same breed that romps around the White House with President Barack Obama's family -- also arrived at 20 months old. Matisse, who got his name because his owners are art lovers, showed well while Obama was delivering his State of the Union address.\n\nMatisse beat out Fifi the Doberman in the working group. The Fifinator, as she's known by her thousands of Facebook fans, won the group last year and came in second this time.\n\nHours earlier, Fifi was sound asleep in her crate, a red rabbit stuffed toy at her paws, looking like the most docile dog in the world. Not exactly how many people see a Doberman pinscher.\n\n\"They can be intimidating,\" owner-breeder-handler Jocelyn Mullins said.\n\nThat's why her rooters hoped she could win best in show this time.\n\n\"It would humanize the breed,\" Westminster Kennel Club President Sean McCarthy said. \"A win for the Doberman would be an acceptance of that breed.\"", "title": "Westminster Dog Show 2013   The Affenpinscher Wins Best In Show", "publishedDate": "2013-02-13T22:51:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7uLJS0oUUzg", "description": "Feuerfest Polka\n\nJosef Strauss", "title": "Feuerfest Polka - Josef Strauss", "publishedDate": "2008-07-23T04:22:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7uLKUgDEKJI", "description": "A new look for Lao Airlines.

DESPERATE to release then when I got the chance. The arrangement took forever and today was my first chance to record so it's kind of a one shot, lol. \n\nObviously, Ashe inspired this. There was a bunch of \"GIRL VERSION PLZ\" in his comments, and I didn't think it made sense to sing Fighting For You in Ib's point of view. Garry's theme song = Garry's song. So I wanted to use Ib's theme song for her's and write my own lyrics.\n\nI've read somewhere that the original composer of the song didn't want his music to be remixed in any way, and I also read that he just wanted to be credited if his composition was used and I wasn't sure if remixed meant taking his track and making it dubstep or something, SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT CONSIDERING THERE'S A PIANO MEDLEY ETC but I will gladly remove this if the -owner- asks me to. No infringement or harm meant. \n\nIb is great, go play it. \n\nAlso, a huge thank you to my subscribers...I know that the bigger YT stars will look at 256 subs like \"PFFFFT WHAT A LOSER\" but I love you ALL and truly appreciate everything, I honestly do, thank you all so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Molti ricorderanno il film di Mario Verger: \u00e8 considerato un cult dell'animazione italiana Anni 90 e fu trasmesso anni fa da Enrico Ghezzi e Marco Giusti in pi\u00f9 riprese a RaiTre su Fuori Orario.

Many will remember the film by Mario Verger: it is considered a cult of Italian 90's and was sent years ago by Marco Giusti and Enrico Ghezzi on several occasions RaiTre of overtime.

Erickson, Robert Evans\nScreenwriter: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\nFilm Description: \"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,\" warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, \"matrimonial work\" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. \"Forget it, Jake,\" his old partner tells him. \"It's Chinatown.\" Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score.\n\nchinatown,\"chinatown clip\",\"chinatown full movie\",\"chinatown destroyer\",\"jack nicholson\",\"faye dunaway\",\"john huston\",\"perry lopez\",\"belinda palmer\",\"roman polanski\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic thrillers\",\"20th century period pieces\",classics,\"crime dramas\",\"film noir\",mystery,\"period pieces\",\"co erickson\",\"robert evans\",\"consequences videos\",\"disillusionment videos\",\"evil videos\",\"street videos\",katherine,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9362,/m/0c12h,/m/02z5bft,/m/09fb5,/m/0hwbd", "title": "It's Chinatown - Chinatown (9/9) Movie CLIP (1974) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T21:15:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "7uTgDQXonZU", "description": "Preview of a track forthcoming on my Frame Of Mind EP on Subsphere Records.\n\nThis is very experimental and different for me, hope it paid off.\n\nFollow me (especially on Twitter):\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/TwoThirdsDnB\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TwoThirdsDnB\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/dranner123\nhttp://soundcloud.com/lewismd\n\nSubsphere Records: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/SubsphereRecords \nhttp://www.subsphererecords.com/", "title": "TwoThirds - Frame Of Mind [Forth.

We're at a tipping point and, quite possibly, our country as we know it may be lost forever if we don't change the course in which our country is headed.\"\n\nGena warns that voter apathy among evangelicals in 2008 may have contributed to Obama's election in the first place.\n\n\"With our country at a crossroads, Chuck and I have asked ourselves what we can be doing to help support this great country we're blessed to live in and how we can encourage our like-minded American brothers and sisters to unite and let their voices be heard,\" she said. \"It is estimated that in the 2008 election, 30 million evangelical Christians stayed home on voting day and Obama won the election by 10 million votes.\"\n\nChuck cautions Christians about the cost of doing nothing while the nation spirals into a state of socialism from which there will be no return.\n\n\"We know you love your family and your freedom as much as Gena and I do,\" he says in his appeal to Americans. \"And it is because of that we can no longer sit quietly or stand on the sidelines and watch our country go the way of socialism or something much worse.\"\n\nGena urged Christians to register and cast their votes on Election Day to ensure \"our voices will be heard.\"\n\nChuck recalled the cautionary words of great patriots on the subject of preserving liberty:\n\n\"As Edmund Burke said, 'All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.'\n\n\"Our great president, Ronald Reagan said, 'Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on for them to do the same.'\"\n\nLikewise, Gena noted, \"President Reagan went on to say that 'You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done.'\"\n\nChuck Norris concludes the announcement by encouraging Americans to close ranks and defend their great nation \"for God and country.\"\n\n\"Please stand with us,\" he urges. \"Let's unite for God and country. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. See you at the polls.\"\n\nNorris has been writing a weekly column exclusively for WND since Oct. 23, 2006. The star of \"Walker: Texas Ranger\" and some of the biggest action pictures ever, Norris has also reached a new generation as part of the Internet craze for one-liners usually labeled not as jokes but as \"facts.\"\n\nIn \"The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book,\" Norris gives readers not only his favorite \"facts,\" roundhouse-kicked by the man himself, but also the stories behind the facts and the code by which he lives his life.\n\nIn his bestselling book, \"Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America,\" Norris provides real solutions for solving the nation's problems, moving the country forward and changing its course for the better.\n\nRead more: http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/chuck-norris-dire-warning-for-america/\n\nDon't forget to visit:\n@ http://www.chucknorris.com\n@ http://www.facebook.com/officialchucknorrispage\n@ http://www.kickstartkids.org", "title": "Chuck Norris' dire warning for America - 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-09-02T05:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7udAy1wv5r4", "description": "", "title": "Comment faire un plan d'un essai de classification", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T14:46:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7udRzheO3eg", "description": "Demorou mas est\u00e1 ai..\nNosso grande \u00cdDOLO..

He belongs to All India Majlis-e Ittihad al-Muslimin and is its floor leader in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.\n\nHis elder brother is Asaduddin Owaisi, Member of Parliament representing Hyderabad constituency.\n\nThis Communally Provocative Speech was delivered at Nirmal, Adilabad, Andhra Pradesh on 24 Dec 2012\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAll India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM or MIM) is a Muslim political party inIndia. Hyderabad is the stronghold of the AIMIM.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe party has roots back to the days of the princely State of Hyderabad. It was founded and shaped by NawabMahmood Nawaz Khan Qiledar Golconda of Hyderabad State by the advice of Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan the Nizam of Hyderabad and in the presence of Ulma-e-Mashaeqeen in 1927 as a pro-Nizam party. then it was only Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) and the first meeting was held in the house of Nawab Mahmood Nawaz Khan his house name was\"Touheed Manzil\". The MIM advocated the set up of a Muslim dominion rather than integration with India. In 1938 Bahadur Yar Jung was elected President of the MIM which had a cultural and religious manifesto soon acquired political complexion and became aligned with the Muslim League in British India. He soon rose to be the supreme and unquestioned leader of the MIM and imparted a new militancy to it.\n\nOn December 26, 1943, Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung delivered an important speech in the All India Muslim Leagueconference Lahore. In the first half of his speech he laid stress on the struggle for Pakistan. In the second half he talked about the creation of Pakistan. At the end he said,\n\n\"Muslims! Decisions made under pressure do not last for long. To-day we are not in need of a tree that blooms like a flower or in need of fruit that tastes sweet to our mouths. Instead, we are in the need of fine manure that dissolves in the soil and strengthens the roots. That will unite with the water and soil to produce beautiful flowers. That will destroy itself but will leave its scent and taste in the flowers. We are at present not in need of beautiful scenery that looks good to the eyes, but what we need are foundation stones that will bury themselves in the soil to make the building standing on them strong.\"\n\nBanned:\n\nThe Razakars (volunteers), a Muslim paramilitary organization aimed at sabotaging Hindus in Deccan, was directly linked to the MIM. In total up to 150,000 Razakar soldiers were mobilized to fight against the Indian Union and for the independence of the Hyderabad State against Indian integration and to force its eventual merger into Pakistan instead. After the integration of the Hyderabad state with India, the MIM was banned in 1948 till 1957.

It is the smallest of the four Galilean moons.\n\nAt just over 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon and is the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, its mass nonetheless significantly exceeds the combined mass of all moons in the Solar System smaller than itself.It is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is composed of ice and is one of the smoothest in the Solar System. This young surface is striated by cracks and streaks, while craters are relatively infrequent. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life.Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity.", "title": "Europa is the sixth moon of the planet Jupiter.", "publishedDate": "2008-04-22T17:55:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7vAUOvObZfY", "description": "LUX.

What kind of individual life, and what sorts of social communities, did the transcendentalists imagine? How did they understand notions like \"self-reliance\" and \"experience\"? Is Thoreau's famous move to Walden Pond best interpreted as a proto-libertarian withdrawal from the community, or the first step towards a new community, differently oriented and committed? In this course we will read Emerson's Nature and his major essays, and Thoreau's Walden and selections from his journals. We will be attentive to how transcendentalist thought was influenced by German idealists, English romantics, the Bhavagad-Gita, and other sources, and how it in turn influenced abolitionist actions and communal utopian experiments.

It connected immediately with Tiesto demanding a copy when he heard it in the booth no less. The demand from djs and clubbers for this one has been overwhelming, and, with a significant promo plan in place this is set to be one of Michael's most prominent releases in recent times. The package serves up a funky alternative from internationally renowned duo Plastik Funk as well as an extended club mix from Michael himself. \n\nRolling into the summer season with tour dates from Ibiza to Toronto and a residency at Hakkasan (Las Vegas) in the midst of it all, Michael's globe trotting is as hectic as ever. If that was not enough, while he prepares the finishing touches to his forthcoming material, he has the launch of his newly revamped and soon to be weekly podcast to come in July.

L\u2019artista cercava in tutti i modi di continuare l\u2019esibizione, finch\u00e8 il padrone di casa Carlo Conti ha stoppato la musica e ha invitato Veronica Maya a girarsi per coprirsi.

Anche Cristian De Sica ci scherza su affermando di \u201caver visto la Madonna\u201d.\n\nA questo punto Carlo Conti manda la pubblicit\u00e0 per dare il tempo a Veronica Maya di sistemarsi. Al rientro in studio il conduttore precisa che durante le prove tutto era andato bene e che il crollo del vestito della Maya \u00e8 stato inaspettato.\n\n\nVeronica Maya dopo la pubblicit\u00e0 torna sul palco, indossando lo stesso vestito rosa al quale sono state aggiunte le spalline, cucite in tempo record dalle costumiste di Rai1. La donna ripete l\u2019esibizione che per\u00f2 non convince i giudici, che a fine serata la posizionano nelle parti basse della classifica.\nMagari l\u2019esibizione non ha ottenuto ottimi risultati, ma in questa puntata le visualizzazioni della replica di Tale e Quale Show saranno sicuramente altissime.\nImbarazzante imprevisto nel programma di Rai1 \"Tale e Quale Show\": Veronica Maya, che stava imitando Madonna sulle note di \"Material girl\", \u00e8 rimasta a seno nudo. \nLa Maya si stava dimenando sul palco quando l\u2019ardita impalcatura del suo vestito ha ceduto tra l'imbarazzo del pubblico e degli ospiti presenti.\nCoraggiosamente la concorrente del programma continua a ballare e cantare, finch\u00e8 non interviene Carlo Conti a fermare l'imitazione.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeronica Maya seno nudo in tv 07 - 11 - 2014 TODAY\nOggi seno nudo maya tv 07 11 2014\nIncredible seno maya Tale Quale Show 2014\nIncredibile Tale Quale Show nudo maya seno Maya Tv 2014", "title": "Veronica Maya seno nudo Tale Quale Show durante la trasmissione in Tv - NEWS ITA", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T17:17:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7vX1zEJ2_SE", "description": "Our Middle School program was designed to meet the needs of this age group.

Like monitor lizards, bearded dragons and the lot. But quickly the size of them, their pretty calm demeanor and the inexpensive nature of them turned them into pets. I know many a school teacher who has brought hissing cockroaches because they can keep one animal in their class. And what's easier to keep than a cockroach? You pretty much just keep it in the tank and throw any kind of organic matter in there, and it is good to go. That's all it eats.\n\nIt's very simple to breed. As anybody who's ever lived in New York City or any other urban environment understands cockroaches breed readily. We try to keep that to a minimum here at our place. But we do like to tell people that there's nothing to worry about in our climate, anywhere. I come from New York. As far as if the animal gets out it's not going to survive in a cold environment like New York. So if it does escape by any stretch of the imagination you do not have to worry about it inhabiting your house and taking over like other cockroach species.\n\nThe hissing cockroach, of course, it's claim to fame, and of course I'm unable so far to get one to do that, is the male of the species when picked up will let out a loud hiss. It pushes air through a series of baffles in its head and out comes sssssss, a hissing noise if you squeeze a little bit. And I can't get one to do it, of course, now. But that's what they do. Hissing cockroaches, therefore, are fun for kids. They are animated in their design. They are used in all kinds of cartoons and television shows from the Lion King to the movie Madagascar. You can see these little guys running around or replicas of them. \n\nThey get huge. Three or four inches sometime you'll see them. And long lived for a cockroach. Not unusual for one to be five years old. If you have two or three, you're probably going to get a male and a female and you will have baby cockroaches and you can keep that colony going for a long, long time.\n\nFor animal food they're one of the best. Way better than crickets which are very, very dry skinned animals. There's not much meat on them, if you will. A cockroach really has a lot of protein in it. And in some areas of the country of Madagascar they're actually consumed by human beings. Imagine that. I guess anything with spaghetti sauce tastes good, right?\n\nSo, the hissing cockroach is an interesting creature. Much misunderstood. Just because it's from the cockroach family doesn't mean it's a bad guy. We like them here at Jungle Bobs. I think you would doo. \n\nThe Madagascar hissing cockroach.", "title": "8 Madagascar Hissing Cockroach Facts | Pet Tarantulas", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T18:30:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7vjv5kg6a1w", "description": "Plantas do Cerrado \u00e9 uma s\u00e9rie exibida nos intervalos da programa\u00e7\u00e3o da TV Brasil Pantanal - MS, com dois minutos cada um, que tem o objetivo de divulgar e valorizar o cerrado brasileiro.

For every $100 you gave the wizard.. He would give you back $10/year FOREVER and ever! So how much % do you get every year? 10%. Because $10 is 10% of $100. Guess what? This 10% is called your RATE of RETURN (careful, this is not yet your INTERNAL rate of return...) So this 10% Rate of Return tells you HOW QUICKLY you get back your money in EXACTLY 1 year... compared to your original $100. \n\nSo this 10% Rate of Return tells you HOW QUICKLY you get back your money in EXACTLY 1 year... compared to your original $100. Now what if... It wasn't that simple... What if the wizard brought you back a different amount every year? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w-UWuDi0fY On some lucky years, he might bring back $70 On other years, he might bring back only $5.. And what if... It was NOT forever? What if it was for exactly 7 years? What is your % Rate of Return now? Not so easy to know now, right? It's like the rate of return is now HIDDEN... This \"hidden\" rate of return is now called the INTERNAL Rate of Return or simply IRR. \n\nTo find the exact %, we use the IRR Formula. Don't panic! I promise it's much easier that it looks! So if you know your business' Internal Rate of Return, how do you use it? This simplest example is this: Let's say you borrowed money to buy a candy machine for business.  When you compare the money you earn from the candy machine with the amount you paid for the candy machine, you can compute your candy machine's IRR... ... and when you know your candy machine's IRR, you can then compare it to your borrowing cost. If your business borrows money from the bank at a 4% interest rate and your Internal Rate of Return is 10%, then you WIN 6%... Because 10% minus 4% is 6%. On the other hand, if your business borrows money at a 4% interest rate, but  your candy machine's IRR is only 3%, then you LOSE.", "title": "3 Minutes!

The new version improves on key strengths while delivering essential new features at the same time. In total more than one hundred improvements are made and the character model library now includes many new models and animations. Improved shadow functions result in high detail shadows and even shadows at long ranges now look sharp. Workflow has been improved in several areas. You now have the ability, for example, to import content from one project into another project. The content browsers now include the option to define favorite items so you can quickly find them.\n\nNew Character Models And Animations\n\nLumion 4.5 Pro includes 24 new character models. The models increase ethnic diversity of the character library and also provide several new animations and poses.  The new models include several business people, people involved in sporting activities, a woman with a baby carriage, people sunbathing and even some people swimming. With these new models it's easier than ever to bring your visualizations to life.\nlumion 4.5 people1\nImproved Shadows And Reflections\n\nThe shadow effect now includes an option for three quality levels. This allows you to create ultra sharp shadow edges up to a level where you can see the individual leaves of a tree.  The shadow routines are completely rewritten to extend their range further in the distance while providing excellent sharpness at close ranges. The new enhancements particularly improve the quality of aerial shots and sun studies. Glossy surfaces are drawn with improved quality by removing errors and improving the filtering of the reflections. The amount of blur now accurately represents the glossiness and looks smoother. Light reflecting off surfaces now looks better as distracting visual errors are removed and this increases overall quality.\nWorkflow Enhancements\n\nPro users can now load their .ls4 file into an existing scene. After selecting a file the options is presented to import light, models, imports or any combination of them.  In Photo and Movie mode you can now copy-paste individual effects and you can save and load entire effect stacks. This is great to store your favorite effects to disk for use in another project. The content browser allows you to add models to your favorites list so you can quickly find them later. When you have assigned one or more favorites, a new tab will appear listing all your favorite models. Moving, rotating and sizing models now offers more detailed control. The new user interface allows you to type in values or use sliders to orientate, size or position models.\nlumion 4.5 merge\nAutomated Lights\n\nLights now have an extra setting which makes them turn on automatically at night. They can be randomized so they do not turn on all at once. With this feature enabled, all you have to do is animate the sun position to create a nice effect for night scenes.\nlumion 4.5  lights\nConfigurable Sun And Moon Disc Size\n\nCreate artistic images by enlarging the moon. In real life if you want to enlarge the moon you have to use the zoom angle of your camera.In Lumion 4.5 you can directly control the size of the moon with a movie or photo effect.\n\nlumion 4.5 moon\nLumion 4.5 is expected to be available on May 1st 2014.", "title": "Lumion : Lumion 4 5 Upgrade  Preview", "publishedDate": "2014-04-16T16:29:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "7w4LGJuwa84", "description": "Hitler, G\u00fcnsche, G\u00f6bbels VS Rick Astley, Eduard Khil and Keyboard Cat\nSpot the hidden Jodl and leave a comment :D \n\nThis video took me way too long to make.

About half of the total body magnesium is found in bones and the other half inside the cells of tissues and organs. Only 1% is in the blood, and the kidneys try to keep this levels constant by excreting more or less with the urine.\n\nIn contrast, 99% of calcium is in bones, and the rest in the fluid outside of cells. Muscles contract when calcium moves into the cells, and they relax when calcium is again pumped out and magnesium moves in. This cellular pump requires much energy to pump calcium out, and if cells are low in energy, then calcium may accumulate inside cells. Low cellular energy may be due to Candida, faulty sugar or fat metabolism, deficiencies, or accumulating metabolic wastes and toxins.\n\nThis then leads to only partial relaxation of the muscles with stiffness, a tendency to cramps, and poor blood and lymph circulation. The problem gets worse the more calcium moves from bones into soft tissue. Nerve cells can also accumulate calcium, leading to faulty nerve transmission, in the lens it causes cataracts, hormonal output keeps reducing as endocrine glands increasingly calcify, and all other cells become handicapped in their normal functions. In addition it causes intracellular magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is needed to activate countless enzymes, and a deficiency leads to inefficient and blocked energy production.\n\nA further problem is that excess calcium damages the cell membrane and makes it difficult for nutrients to move in and wastes to move out. When the intracellular calcium level gets too high the cell will die.\n\nHere we can see the importance of boron as a regulator of cell membrane functions, especially in regard to movements of calcium and magnesium. With boron deficiency too much calcium moves into the cell while magnesium cannot move inside to displace it. This is the condition of old age and of the boron-deficiency diseases leading up to it.\n\nWhile in good health and especially in younger years a calcium - magnesium ratio of 2 : 1 is normal and beneficial and supplied with a good diet. But with increasing age, boron deficiency and resulting disease conditions we need progressively less calcium and more magnesium.\n\nFor boron to be fully effective in reversing tissue calcification ample magnesium is required. For elderly individuals I recommend 400 to 600 mg of magnesium together with the daily borax supplementation spaced out during the day, and with protracted joint problems additional trans-dermal magnesium. However, oral magnesium may need to be adjusted according to its laxative effect. I am doubtful whether calcium supplements are needed and beneficial, even in case of osteoporosis. In my view these individuals have plenty of calcium stored in soft tissues where it does not belong, and supplementing boron and magnesium is expected to redeposit this misplaced calcium into bones. I regard the medical focus on a high calcium intake as a prescription for accelerated aging. \n\nOriginal article: http://www.health-science-spirit.com/borax.htm", "title": "The Boron and Borax Miracle 6 - Calcium Magnesium Metabolism", "publishedDate": "2014-07-06T20:53:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wANgvmal34", "description": "The Gunny Sack Jr is rugged high quality gun carrying waist pack.\nIt has several pockets for carrying additional items and a quick pull tab for instant access to your fire arm.", "title": "Gunny Sack Jr", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T04:15:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wARBr7tJOE", "description": "Want to hear what others have to say about the benefits of a bi-weekly interest savings program?

It is a very popular festival and has slowly become one of the most prominent tourism festivals of the North East region.\n\nThe Anthurium Festival is celebrated every year at the tourist resort in Reiek Village at the foothills of the mystic Reiek Mountain. Set in an idyllic and mystic location about 20kms away from Aizwal, the capital city of Mizoram, the serene and tranquil beauty of Reiek Village adds an amazing charm to the beautiful Anthurium Festival. Beautiful Anthurium flowers grown in Mizoram are put on display and sold during the Anthurium Festival and tours to amazing Anthurium plantations are also conducted during the 3 day festival. What started as a way of promoting tourism and the amazing homegrown Anthurium flowers in Mizoram has slowly become one of the most anticipated festivals for tourists both from within as well as outside the country.\n\nIn addition, Anthurium Festival is an event where all the various Mizo tribes get to come together and showcase their amazing cultures and traditions. The 3 day-long celebrations are marked by a colorful display of various Mizo cultures and traditions; indigenous games and sports, mouth-watering traditional Mizo delicacies, folk songs and dances, traditional methods of harvesting and cooking, handicrafts etc. Various local products of Mizoram like fruit juices, pickles, handicrafts, handloom items, bamboo products etc are also put on display and sold during the festival. Fashion shows and music concerts highlighting the talented Mizos are also an important aspect of the Anthurium Festival.\n\nAnthurium Festival, for a tourist, is indeed a great festive moment to enjoy the vibrant diversity of Mizoram. As a festival that not only highlights the tourism potential of the state but also showcases the amazing culture and tradition of the Mizos, the Anthurium Festival is a must attend.     \n\nSource:- http://reviewne.com/anthurium-festival\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

If Freudian theory invites us to recognise this urge as specifically erotic, then the undead body is effectively engorged with desire -- bloated by its own sexual appetite. The rigid and stumbling corpse now reads as a tumescent phallus, stiffly swaying this way and that in its quest for pleasure. Eros is resurrected as an unruly swelling of desire within the civilized order -- a transgressive fleshy bulge within the very social fabric that attempts to smother all manifestations of sexual arousal. Civilization requires the body to be instrumentalised and malleable, yet the sexually primed and defiantly stiff corpse refuses to be moulded into a pliable and subservient human tool. \n\nBut the zombie is more than phallic. It consumes life so that it might give birth to death. And by spawning death it simultaneously creates a new life -- undead life. Barbara Creed argues that the Freudian castration complex perpetually casts women as being sexually and symbolically passive. She recites instead the figure of a consuming and all-encompassing womb that wishes to draw life back into itself. The female genitals are no longer castrated, but castrating. This notion of a devouring femininity summons the mythological image of the vagina dentata -- the toothed vagina -- that literally consumes life and returns it to the womb from whence it came. That which gives birth now also gives death. Thanatos is thus able to find symbolic expression in the devouring capabilities of the womb. The bloodied mouth of the undead corpse -- the very thing that consumes living flesh and turns it into decaying mater -- becomes a vivid articulation of the consuming female genitals. \n\nAnd so the alliance between Eros and Thanatos casts the zombie as both a phallus and a vagina dentata. Its stiff body is the insubordinate erection and its bloody mouth the toothed entrance to the devouring womb. The two symbols coalesce as an undead psychoanalytical monster that terrorises civilisation with its erotic appetite for death. The phallus is all a quiver, coursing with a libidinal intent that refuses the reality principle's doctrine of un-pleasure. Its frenulum splays open to reveal a fissure on the underside of the glans. This parting of flesh forms a pair of labia that frame a glistening set of teeth. The diabolical diagrammatic hybrid shuffles along awkwardly, propelled only by the motion of its cumbersome testicles that lilt and lurch erratically one after the after.  And so it is that psychoanalysis and Romero's undead oeuvre collide with and corrupt one another to author an entirely new breed of Freudian zombie.", "title": "The Freudian Zombie", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T00:58:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wWLp-1cIP0", "description": "Yellow-Eyed Girl", "title": "Yellow-Eyed Girl - The Dropas", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T00:12:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wWQ-0CKv1M", "description": "Watch the behind the scenes in the link below: \nhttp://youtu.be/s9QBeGsBj_g\nWe filmed this in the Great Bear Rainforest, located on the central coast of British Columbia on Canada\u2019s west coast.\n\nWe stayed at Nimmo Bay lodge during the making of this video.\nCheck out their website in the link: http://www.nimmobay.com\n\nThis video would not have been possible without Destination British Columbia and the Canadian Tourism Commission making it possible.\n\nFor more info on them, check out @HelloBC / @ExploreCanada \nhttp://instagram.com/hellobc\nhttp://instagram.com/ExploreCanada \n\nhttp://AboriginalBC.com\n\nWe also had an amazing local guide our last day on the trip.

However, from above the buildings are constructed to form a swastika shape.\n\nThe buildings were supposed to have been modified nearly three years ago, but the complex has not been touched.\n\n\"It's hard to understand why this is taking so long. Am I angry? No. Am I disappointed? Yes,\" said Morris Casuto of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nCasuto was one of several community members who pressed the U.S. Navy to do something about the design in 2007.\n\n\"It dishonors our service people to have them living in a building in the shape of a swastika,\" said Casuto.\n\nAs a result, the Navy's plan was to spend $625,000 on a single-rooftop canopy to mask the design. However, that plan was quickly scrapped because many saw it as insufficient.\n\nNavy officials told 10News it has a new, larger-scale plan to transform the current buildings into a new design that would include a series of connections to mask the swastika and at the same time create more square footage and infrastructure to support rooms and additional sailors.\n\nThe price tag for the Navy's latest proposal is between $17 million and $40 million, and it is to be submitted for the 2011 fiscal year.\n\n\"The price tag of $17 million to $40 million just doesn't make any sense to me, and as a taxpayer it's just irresponsible,\" said Rhonda Deniston of Oceanside-based watchdog group Stop Taxing Us.\n\nA former member of the military, Deniston said she is sympathetic toward those who are offended by the design, but also finds the proposed cost of the Navy's plan \"offensive.\"\n\n\"It's a perfect example of what taxpayers are talking about right now within not only the federal level, but also the state and local level, that money is being spent in incredibly irresponsible ways,\" added Deniston.\n\nBut what many find most surprising is that Navy officials did not become aware of the design until after the 1967 groundbreaking and decided not to do anything then.\n\n\"It seems to me that it is virtually impossible to believe that no one noticed that shape,\" said Casuto.", "title": "Cost To Mask Swastika-Shaped Complex Scrutinized", "publishedDate": "2010-04-29T11:59:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wcodzruYGU", "description": "http://www.liz-green.com - For me this Alternative Treatment for Menieres Disease is a Miracle, I know it works well for others as well.

Zamorano, MD.: La enfermedad valvular card\u00edaca est\u00e1 haci\u00e9ndose mucho m\u00e1s prevalente con el envejecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n. \u00bfQu\u00e9 son las v\u00e1lvulas card\u00edacas? El coraz\u00f3n tiene 4 c\u00e1maras, son como 4 habitaciones. Las dos aur\u00edculas el piso de arriba, aur\u00edcula izquierda y derecha y el piso de abajo los ventr\u00edculos izquierdo y derecho. Separando aur\u00edculas y ventr\u00edculas o separando algunas c\u00e1maras est\u00e1n las v\u00e1lvulas card\u00edacas que son 4: mitral, a\u00f3rtica, pulmonar y tric\u00faspide. Y la enfermedad valvular card\u00edaca es simplemente cuando enferman una de estas v\u00e1lvulas. Y \u00bfc\u00f3mo pueden enfermar? \n\nPensemos que las v\u00e1lvulas son como puertas que comunican una habitaci\u00f3n, una c\u00e1mara cardiaca con otra, pues puede que la puerta no abra bien y eso es lo que llamamos estenosis valvular.  O puede que la puerta abra perfectamente pero lo que pasa es que cuando cierra no cierra bien, deja un cierre incompleto de la v\u00e1lvula y a eso le llamamos insuficiencia valvular. Cada vez se est\u00e1 haciendo m\u00e1s prevalente la enfermedad valvular a\u00f3rtica y \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? Porque la v\u00e1lvula degenera con la edad, el envejecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n nos hace que se produzcan procesos degenerativos a nivel de la v\u00e1lvula, calcificaci\u00f3n de la v\u00e1lvula y que la v\u00e1lvula no abra bien. \n\nLa estenosis de la v\u00e1lvula a\u00f3rtica esta siendo cada vez un proceso m\u00e1s frecuente. \u00bfC\u00f3mo diagnosticarlo?

Y luego la ecocardiograf\u00eda es sin duda la t\u00e9cnica de diagn\u00f3stico de elecci\u00f3n en el paciente con valvulopat\u00eda; nos dir\u00e1 el eco si es una estenosis, una insuficiencia y la severidad. \n\nAprender m\u00e1s sobre Dr. Jos\u00e9 Zamorano: http://www.jlzamorano.com", "title": "\u00bfQue Es La Enfermedad Valvular Card\u00edaca?", "publishedDate": "2012-10-16T15:12:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7wkXbX5jHdM", "description": "Please Read: These are methods that I stand behind because it is what I do on a daily routine.

It is May 8, 2010, the day the Baltic Gay Parade is held in the Lithuanian capital. In particular during the past years Lithuania has been regularly in the news because of its xenophobic and homophobic outbursts, and today we experience a distinct taste of it.\n\nThe Gay Parade is to be held on the other side of the city bank, where under leadership of the previous mayor a new modern city district started to develop. New high-rise, including a stylish Europe Center shopping mall and a new city hall hide the old wooden houses of Snipiskes, a district that before the war was primarily inhabited by the Jewish community of Vilnius and that is slowly but surely erased from the city landscape. The territory where the parade will be held is turned into a fortress: fences, a multitude of police, partially on horseback, and riot police on standby make it impossible to reach the Parade  only those who have been registered in advance have been allowed in. Its an interesting feeling: you come to express your support but you are not allowed to do so. \n\nHowever, soon it becomes clear why these precaution measures were necessary. The number of onlookers and counter-demonstrators far exceeds the number of participants in the Parade (which includes the Dutch Ambassador Joep Wijnands, a strong supporter of gay rights). It is not directly clear on what side people are on, whether they came to support gay rights or protest against it. Some, however, make their point very clear. Banners read Lithuania does not need creeps or No lesbian and gay march! while some have brought crucifixes to protests against this contamination of Lithuanian values and morals. And this is no joke: an opinion polls indicates that 90% of the Lithuanians are against homosexuals, and the age where support is stronger is among the younger generation, between 19 and 25 years old. \n\nWhen standing among the public watching the Parade my blood runs cold, listening to the conversations. My Lithuanian might still be limited, but the conversations are pretty clear. The most prevailing words are provocation and pederasts, and the presence of a fascist gang evokes emotions ranging from laughter to outright support. The group is not large, agreed, but they can roam about freely and are in no way hindered in expressing their views: Away with pederasts, away with Jews, away with occupants, with here and there a creative variety like Euro-pederasts. A banner shows the Prime Minister taking the mayor of Vilnius from behind  undoubtedly he belongs to the category of Euro-pederasts. Fascists demonstrating freely in a city where the whole Jewish community of 80,000 inhabitants was murdered: it evokes some very special feelings.\n\nThis is the European Union, this is an ancient cosmopolitan city with a rich and also painful pasts. But it is a city that clearly has not fully accepted European morals and values. To the contrary, it has no problem receiving European funds and other financial support in recovering from fifty years of totalitarianism, yet at the same time European values and norms are being seen as contamination of our people, as foreign to Lithuanian norms and values Even the national Sajudis movement, which was instrumental in reestablishing Lithuanian independence in 1990, has issued an advance statement with the same message, shamefully violating the basic principles of liberty and equality that guided its actions in the late 1980s.

La erupci\u00f3n es cr\u00f3nica, lo que significa que contin\u00faa durante un per\u00edodo de tiempo prolongado.\nCausas, incidencia y factores de riesgo\nLa dermatitis herpetiforme generalmente comienza en personas de 20 a\u00f1os de edad en adelante, aunque puede afectar algunas veces a los ni\u00f1os. Esta afecci\u00f3n se observa tanto en hombres como en mujeres.\nSe desconoce su causa; sin embargo, la dermatitis herpetiforme frecuentemente est\u00e1 asociada con la sensibilidad al gluten (enfermedad cel\u00edaca) en el intestino delgado.\nS\u00edntomas\nEn general, la dermatitis herpetiforme es extremadamente pruriginosa y las ves\u00edculas o ampollas aparecen usualmente en los codos, las rodillas, la espalda y los gl\u00fateos. En la mayor\u00eda de los casos, la erupci\u00f3n es del mismo tama\u00f1o y forma en ambos lados. Los s\u00edntomas de este tipo de dermatitis tienden a ser intermitentes.\nSignos y ex\u00e1menes\nEn la mayor\u00eda de los casos, se realiza una prueba de inmunofluorescencia directa y una biopsia de piel. El m\u00e9dico puede recomendar tambi\u00e9n una biopsia de los intestinos.\nTratamiento\nEste trastorno se puede tratar con dapsona, un antibi\u00f3tico que puede ayudar a la mayor\u00eda de los pacientes. Asimismo, se recomienda una dieta libre de gluten con el fin de controlar la enfermedad. El cumplimiento de dicha dieta puede eliminar la necesidad de los medicamentos y prevenir complicaciones posteriores.\nExpectativas (pron\u00f3stico)\nLa enfermedad se puede controlar bien con tratamiento, pero sin \u00e9ste, el riesgo de c\u00e1ncer intestinal puede ser significativo.\nComplicaciones\nLa enfermedad de tiroides se puede encontrar en muchos pacientes que sufren dermatitis herpetiforme. Estos pacientes tambi\u00e9n son m\u00e1s propensos a desarrollar ciertos c\u00e1nceres de los intestinos.\nSituaciones que requieren asistencia m\u00e9dica\nSe debe consultar con el m\u00e9dico si se presenta una erupci\u00f3n que contin\u00faa a pesar del tratamiento casero.\nPrevenci\u00f3n\nNo se conoce una forma de prevenci\u00f3n para esta enfermedad, pero las personas que la padecen pueden prevenir las complicaciones evitando alimentos que contengan gluten.\nNombres alternativos\nEnfermedad de Duhring", "title": "Dermatitis Herpetiforme", "publishedDate": "2011-03-10T09:37:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7x0j85F6bsA", "description": "The online retail giant is reportedly planning to build a physical store in midtown Manhattan.\n\nWant to see more Fortune Video?

Insufficient water intake, poor diet and being overweight are considered to be grand contributors. Have you ever considered that hormonal imbalances and constipation may be at the root of the problem?\n\nConstipation causes swelling in the colon and therefore creates pressure on the prostate gland which sits in close proximity. Because of the location, constipation allows bacteria to migrate from the colon to the prostate. In turn, this inflammation and swelling is called prostatitis.\n\nThe causes of constipation are many. Poor nutrition, holding back, lack of physical exercise, emotional and mental stress, medications, lack of enough good quality water and the myriad of poisons that infiltrate us on a daily basis. \nAre you searching for the best prostate natural treatment that really work? look no further, We have a solution for you.

Since the radiation dissipated rapidly after the rain, was the radiation Radon or other? Radon's half life is slightly over 3 days, this radionuclide's half life was shorter than one hour.\n\nRadon daughters: the concentration of radon gas and its decay products depends greatly on temperature and weather patterns. When the air is cooler, or when there is an inversion layer \"holding down\" air near the ground, there can be a higher concentration of radon gas and its decay products -- especially Lead-214 and Bismuth-214, which are strong gamma and beta emitters and are quite radioactive. Other weather conditions can cause large variations as well, especially rain. Rain washes the radon progeny out of the air. So when it rains, there should generally be a short spike in the gamma and beta counts followed by a period of lower counts.\nhttp://www.radonserv.com/message.asp?id=640\n\nThere may be other radionuclides present such as Iodine 131 or Iodine 135 and their progenies. Without spectrographic analysis it is not possible to identify the specific offending radionuclide.\n\nMonitoring during the rain event demonstrated elevated airborne count readings at 1 meter in excess of 100 counts per minute (CPM) as reflected on the Radiation Network dot com.Ground readings were higher than 150CPM. 1602 was the highest reading.\n\nWindows Media Video (WMV) Production by Garry Morgan.
