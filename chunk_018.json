Eastman, and Munro Leaf. Although the United States Army gave Walt Disney the first crack at creating the cartoons, Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. animation studio underbid Disney by two-thirds and won the contract. Disney had also demanded exclusive ownership of the character, and merchandising rights.\n\nThe goal was to help enlisted men with weak literacy skills learn through animated cartoons (and also supplementary comic books). They featured simple language, racy illustrations, mild profanity, and subtle moralizing. Private Snafu did everything wrong, so that his negative example taught basic lessons about secrecy, disease prevention, and proper military protocols.\n\nPrivate Snafu cartoons were a military secret and for the armed forces only. Surveys to ascertain the soldiers' film favorites showed that the Snafu cartoons usually rated highest or second highest. Each cartoon was produced in six weeks.\n\nThe name \"Private Snafu\" comes from the unofficial military acronym SNAFU - \"Situation Normal: All Fucked Up.\"\n\nPrivate Snafu Cartoons -\n\nPrivate Snafu - Coming!!

While the officers were technically on solid \"legal\" ground in shutting down the stand, they behaved inappropriately by any standard numerous times, using intimidation tactics on protestors and observers, and harassing members of the professional media. The willingness with which children and tourists participated by purchasing lemonade in disobedience of the police instructions is an indicator of how little respect the general public has for government in general, and specifically police when enforcing unjust laws. Gives me hope for America. For those who are complaining about the public property not being used for its intended purpose, part of the point of this that the government should not be using public property for the glorification of government when it could be better used to serve public interests. Excessive vending at the capitol (or without a permit in any public space) would surely be preferable to 22.5% unemployment.

This leads to the midfacial unit including nose and eyes appearing sunken. The cause for this condition is not known. This condition manifests in young age itself.\nThe correction of this condition requires dislodging the entire midfacial structure and fixing a Rigid External Distractor [RED] that slowly distracts the entire midfacial structure to the pre-fixed dimension. The placement of the RED device is a complicated surgery that requires considerable surgical acumen. The base of the skull and vital areas of the face are being involved in the region.\nThe surgery is done in two stages - one for accessing and mobilizing the midface and another for fixing the RED device.\nThe first stage of the surgery is done through a Bicoronal approach, where an incision is placed on the cranium and the entire scalp is carefully elevated till the supra-orbital ridge [eyebrows]. The forehead junction - frontozygomatic, frontonasal junctions are dislodged. The approach is then directed to Infraorbital foramen. Intraoral labiobuccal incision is placed.  Subperiosteal dissection performed along the anterior maxillary wall, to the inferior orbital foramen and on the way exposing the lateral zygomatic-maxillary buttress, the body of the zygoma, and the anterior portion of the zygomatic arch. Then the dissection proceeds to nasomaxillary buttress, the pyriform aperture, and the anterior nasal spine. After the intranasal dissection, the nasal floor, the lateral nasal wall below the inferior turbinate, and medially, the septum and vomer are exposed. Through the back side of the orbit, cuts are placed to involve and dislodge the entire maxilla unit as a whole. Horizontal maxillary osteotomies and separation of the nasal septum and vomer are carried out.\nPins of the RED are placed along the nasal floor, just near the alae of nose. The pins are secured. The RED device is seated to check for stability. The facial bones are secured by means of predetermined plates with considerable accommodation for distraction movement. After the surgery, slow distraction of midfacial structures are performed to bring the entire maxillary unit outside.", "title": "RIGID EXTERNAL DISTRACTION (RED) PLACEMENT FOR TREATMENT (CLEFT MAXILLA) OF CONCAVE FACE", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T18:37:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "04SZ-_QFyDw", "description": "\u25ba\u25ba NEW! https://www.cfa-course.com offers you the perfect preperation for your CFA\u00ae exam -- innovative and flexible!\n\nOverview of our CFA\u00ae online courses: https://www.cfa-course.com/online-courses\n\nThe CFA\u00ae exam-oriented knowledge will be taught in the online courses in basic texts, instructional videos and hundreds of exercises\n\nWe are talking about the Markowitz Portfolio Theory.\nThis is a combination of assets, i.e. a portfolio, is referred to as \"efficient\" if it has the best possible expected level of return for its level of risk (usually proxied by the standard deviation of the portfolio's return).\n\nLearn more: https://www.cfa-course.com/cfa-corporate-finance-and-portfolio-management\n/portfolio-management/introduction-to-portfolio-management/markowitz-portfolio-theory.html\n\nNo matter if you're interested in quantitative methods or economics, our online courses provide you with exam-orientied explanations that led you understand even the toughest issues.", "title": "markowitz portfolio theory efficient frontier cfa-course.com", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T13:26:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "04ShrF1xJ24", "description": "Videoclip espont\u00e1neo de la canci\u00f3n \"El Hombre que fuma Hero\u00edna\" de Fee Reega. \n- Segundo videoclip de la serie de videoclips con narrativa continua de Raisa, Fee Reega y Preparativos para Bodas del sello Pauken Grabaciones\n\nCanci\u00f3n: Fee Reega\nGrabado en Estudios G\u00fcelita en Morvis\nGuitarra el\u00e9ctrica: Pablo de la Destrucci\u00f3n\n\nV\u00eddeo:\nC\u00e1mara y montaje: Daniel Goldmann\nEfectos de postproducci\u00f3n (olla m\u00e1gica): Isabel Roux\n\nGracias a: \nTom\u00e1s Garrido, Ainoa Quevedo, Diego S\u00e1nchez y los duendes del bosque", "title": "Fee Reega - El Hombre que fuma Hero\u00edna", "publishedDate": "2012-04-18T08:53:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "04SqKdzG0qg", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "X1 Blade for Sesamoiditis", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T20:02:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "04T1pJis-eA", "description": ".NET Gadgeteer Servo Joystick", "title": ".NET Gadgeteer Servo Joystick", "publishedDate": "2011-11-29T20:27:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "04T6pP8osRk", "description": "This lovely Tudor home is updated& ready for move-in.

Factory Cost Options: Supersport Upgrade, full roll cage, polished wing protectors, Bilstein adjustable dampers, external and internal battery master switches, engine and fuel tank plumbed fire extinguisher system, motorsport dry sump conversion, motorsport Limited Slip Differential, motorsport aluminium triple pass radiator, motorsport polished manifold and exhaust, Race Tech quick release steering wheel, 4-point harness, Tillet race drivers seat, Caterham leather passenger seat\n\nEXTERIOR\nThis high specification Supersport is finished in bright Diamond White and has an excellent overall appearance. Full weather equipment remains in perfect condition and the complete roll bar adds important safety.  Tiny markings and slight crazing to the near side cycle wing and off side wing are barely noticeable.  The polished wing protectors and polished chrome headlamp bowls are immaculate and offer an unmistakable 'Caterham' look.   The delicate lightweight aluminium bonnet has one tip touched in. This is a truly wonderful exhilarating example. \n\nINTERIOR\nThere is no mistaking the intentions of this particular example with expensive interior options encompassing everything from the incredible Tillet race seat to the Race Tech quick release steering wheel.  The push button ignition quickly reveals healthy readings on all the working analogue gauges and the Caterham 4-point harnesses with contrasting green logo offer a securing embrace for the huge fun that awaits.  All build materials are feather light and raw sparseness is welcomed as owners know it echoes the ethos behind the build of this car- raw energy, style and precision engineering.    \n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nThe Rover K-Series 1.4 litre MPI longitudinally mounted engine is the factory upgraded 'Supersport' variant developing 130bhp at 7,400rpm and 100lbs ft of torque at 5000rpm.  With a kerb weight of just 520kg 0-60 is despatched in 5.9seconds with a top speed of 112mph.  Enthusiastic users will understand the importance of the Motorsport dry sump conversion with a purple anodised scavenge pump, aluminium triple pass radiator and MLS head gasket upgrade kit.  Recent expenditure by Dave Griffiths included the fitting of a new timing-belt kit. The stainless steel competition 4-branch polished manifold and silencer creates a glorious sounding Caterham with an intoxicating and addictive bark.   The 5-speed gearbox provides short, snappy accurate shifts to complete the thrilling package.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nFactory 5-spoke 'High Performance Course' style 16\" light alloy wheels are shod in excellent Kumha 205/45 ZR16 tyres.  The inner sections of the alloy wheels have slight debris markings.  Powerful and recently refurbished brake callipers coupled with adjustable factory fitted Bilstein dampers complete the handling package. \n\nHISTORY FILE\nWith just two former keepers and 10,944 miles this vehicle has important traceable history.  Correspondence from Caterham to the current owner enthusiast in 2007 confirms along with the chassis number the important credentials distinguishing this example, namely, factory built, Supersport, and Race chassis.  Supplied by Caterham on the 27th June 1997 to Arrowstar Ltd where it remained until October 1998 when Mr Lay purchased it as a fun weekend toy.  Used sparingly until 2007 when the current Caterham advocate jumped at the prospect of owning such a well-equipped example knowing full well the individual cost of the components used and their benefits.  Recent maintenance records by Dave Griffiths Racing Ltd will help ensure immediate fun usage.

Zoom 15-45x50mm.\n\n[Currently] You can get the 60mm Celestron 52229 for the same price:  http://PCRoger.com/go/celestron-spotting-scope/?id=60\n\nAs you can see in the video, it has a very nice soft case, hard case, (non-adjustable) tripod, lens caps.\n\nI bought this to use on the rifle range where we typically shoot 50 yards up to 200 yards maximum. As inexpensive as it is, I don't have to worry about it too much with the youth using it; a more expensive spotting scope I know I would be worried about it getting accidentally knocked off the table or otherwise damaged.\n\nSimply set it up, zoom to desired range and adjust the focus knob on top so you can see where the shots are hitting the paper (hopefully hitting the paper!)\n\nThis Celestron Spotting scope has lots of excellent reviews on Amazon too which is what gave me the confidence to buy it.

It's just as hectic behind the scenes, with the chef busily preparing the food. This beautifully detailed building is the setting for so many stories and is a great addition to the modular building series. The Parisian Restaurant has a fully-stocked, blue and white tiled kitchen with tableware as well as a cozy apartment with pull-down bed, kitchenette and fireplace. On the top floor is the artist's room with a studio that includes a cast iron heater, easel, paintbrush and two works of art by the aspiring artist.

The issue is the likelihood that the Port of Shelton will begin removing the 22 remaining fairgrounds buildings soon after Oysterfest [Mason County] ends in early October this year.\n\nIt will take a significant community effort to stop or even delay that action. As you know, I have been a loud voice to save the fairgrounds for the past several years. While on the Port Commission, it was my actions alone that stopped complete destruction of those buildings last year. The entire Port Commission is now in locked step and marching to John Dobson's drum bbeat on this and all other issues. [John Dobson is the unelected/appointed Port manager who appears to treat Port employees as though they were part of his private company--he's a Frankenstein's Monster of sorts who Jay Hupp helped create during his tenure as Port of Shelton Commissioner before he was defeated when he ran for reelection most recently.]\n\nOne of the things that significantly dampened my voice in trying to save the fairgrounds was the YouTube posting [here] on the recall hearing from 2010. [filed by citizens of Mason County attempting to remove Mr. Hupp for malfeasance, misfeasance, and 'stonewalling' citizens when they pleaded with him at Port Commissioner meetings seeking to protect themselves, their children/grandchildren, and the environment from the depredations of Adage, a giant biomassacre corporation seeking to rape and pillage our area forests for a 50 mile radius.] As you know, it leaves me with very little credibility for anyone who views it. That lack of credibility naturally impacts any issue that I become identified with.\n\nFor that reason, I am asking that you remove those YouTube postings [here] and let the past die rather than carry on with negative impacts on things that you and I probably agree on as being for community benefit and betterment.\n\nI'll be looking forward to your thoughts and can be reached at: [restricted for Mr. Hupp's privacy]\n\nSincerely,    /s/ Jay Hupp\n\nEditor's Note: Response is in a following comment.", "title": "11-12-10 Jay Hupp Recall Hearing 1/9", "publishedDate": "2010-11-14T01:43:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "050CA1ikuV8", "description": "Blind Charge na sala de ensaio.\nJulho 2011.", "title": "Blind Charge - Royal Blue", "publishedDate": "2011-08-03T12:28:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "050FNomg5gQ", "description": "Oh Chanukah", "title": "Oh Chanukah", "publishedDate": "2007-08-25T23:40:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "050cYTZW93Q", "description": "Gme (Gerome) Hoff & Fils, Chaux-de-Fonds, quarter repeating automaton with enameled figures, unsigned LeCoultre ebauche, 53mm, 18K rose gold original HC with elaborate engraving and raised escutcheon, fully signed gold cuvette in addition to glazed observation cover", "title": "11515 - Gme (Gerome) Hoff & Fils, Chaux-de-Fonds, quarter repeating automaton Pocketwatch", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T02:05:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "050mlQchmvc", "description": "Tailormade Lancet (by Lordanos)", "title": "Tailormade Lancelot", "publishedDate": "2010-07-04T16:21:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "050x6jdyR0I", "description": "MS-20 mini polyphony using Notelogic from Xhip.net\n\nIf you have questions, leave me a message.", "title": "Deflector - Main Theme (Commodore 64 music) - Korg MS-20 mini - Polyphonic Processing", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T23:46:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0518-trCN0o", "description": "New Project 13", "title": "Prep and prime: Vibrancy Eye primer", "publishedDate": "2011-04-16T16:05:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "051ikUALYmg", "description": "Legal Advice Lawyer Michael Fischer of Fischer and Van Thiel, LLP in San Diego  CA. addresses Family Law questions about Divorce, Child Support, Alimony, Child Custody and more.

By construction screens are divided into two types: cluster and matrix. In cluster screens each pixel, containing from three to several dozens of light-emitting-diodes, is united in a separate light isolated body filled with a sealing compound.       Clusters forming screen information field are fastened to the face of the screen. Each cluster has a wireharness connected to a corresponding control circuit using circuit coupling.       Such a method for making full-color light-emitting-diode screens is becoming old-fashioned and gives way to more technological matrix principle. In matrix light-emitting-diode screens control board and clusters are united in the whole -- matrix, i.e. both light-emitting-diodes and switching electronics with a sealing compound are mounted on the control board        Depending on screen size and resolution the number of light-emitting-diodes can vary from three to several dozens. And distribution of light-emitting-diodes in pixel according to color varies depending on type of light-emitting-diodes in favor of keeping white balance.       One of incontrovertible advantages is that you can use such video screens outside all the year. Therefore they are oftener used for advertising in the streets of big cities and as advisor screens and road signs.

Selon l'ONU, 494 mille personnes ont du fuir leurs foyers, comme ces enfants. Ils font partie des 17 mille personnes qui s'entassent dans ce site prot\u00e9g\u00e9 des Nations unies de Tomping, \u00e0 Juba.\n\nIl n'y a que trois points d'eau potable, et l'on ne peut se servir que deux seaux chaque fois. Les conditions d'hygi\u00e8ne y sont d\u00e9plorables. Le seul ruisseau du camp de Tomping  sert de salle de bains publique et personne n'emp\u00eache les enfants d'y jouer malgr\u00e9 les risques. \n\nPour venir en aide aux 73 mille d\u00e9plac\u00e9s des sites prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, deux cargos de l'Unicef ont atterri mardi \u00e0 Juba. A bord, des m\u00e9dicaments et du mat\u00e9riel d'hygi\u00e8ne venant de Copenhague.\n\n\"Il y a des besoins dans toutes les zones touch\u00e9es.

Anwar juga bercerita tentang dia ada isteri dan 6 orang anak. Orang yang mempunyai kecenderungan bisexual pon boleh kawin dan berkeluarga macam biasa.

They are the only known living animals that have a skull but not a vertebral column. Along with lampreys, hagfish are jawless and are living fossils; hagfish are basal to vertebrates, and living hagfish remain similar to hagfish 300 million years ago.[1]\nThe classification of hagfish has been controversial. The issue is whether the hagfish is itself a degenerate type of vertebrate-fish (most closely related to lampreys), or else may represent a stage which precedes the evolution of the vertebral column (as do lancelets). The original scheme groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving clade of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed-vertebrates). An alternative scheme proposed that jawed-vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish.

Those are the ones that have been cataloged. I'm sure there are a lot more, from cross-pollinations and freaks of nature. For example, this is a Paul Robesen, which is a dark tomato. It comes in dark red, almost black, and it's incredibly flavorful. It's a medium sized tomato. Right now they're green but they're going to turn once the weather starts getting hot for a longer period of time. \n\nThis is another unique variety. This is called Amazon Chocolate, and it's a potato leaf, like the brandywine. So we could expect this tomato to be sort of medium to large sized. They like to branch out and I'll allow more than one sucker on this plant. The leaves are large; usually there are five on each petiole. This is a really tasty variety that goes really dark. That's why it's called Amazon Chocolate: Amazon meaning large, chocolate is that dark bread color. \n\nThe plum tomatoes don't get very tall. They usually will send out large clusters off of the main stem. They also sucker a lot. That means they put out a lot of wasted energy into their extra branches, so I like to trim these down a lot. But they are a wonderful tasting, dark tomato. A lot of the dark tomatoes have a lot of flavor; they have different types of flavor compounds than the red ones, and that's why it's good to mix them. \n\nThis is a Clint Eastwood Rowdy Red. They are beautiful little round, perfectly red tomatoes that I understand taste fabulous. I haven't tried this one but I want to. People give these tomatoes interesting names so that you'll buy them, which happened in this case, because Clint Eastwood Rowdy Red just sounds like too much fun. \n\nThis is called a Goose Creek tomato. It's a very rare variety, and it's an heirloom, so I will be saving the seed from this. This tomato supposedly outperforms and out-tastes other varieties, and that's why I'm trying to grow it. \n\nThis is a Japanese Black Trifellae, and the reason I planted this one is all of them are supposed to taste wonderful, but this one has an interesting shape as well. When the tomato comes in it's a dark, almost black tomato, and it has a teardrop shape. So it will be an interesting shape and an interesting flavor. That's why I choose these unusual varieties, for their unusual taste. \n\nThis is a Peacevine Cherry. Cherry tomatoes set out clusters, always starting at the bottom, and they'll ripen at the bottom as well, and put out usually really bodacious clusters the higher it grows up. There's a couple green ones under there. Then we'll have larger clusters and larger size fruits as this plant matures and gets more and more sun up here, more and more heat.", "title": "Unique Varieties of Tomatoes", "publishedDate": "2011-07-15T06:46:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "05L8UhsFmEU", "description": "", "title": "My First Go at the Engineer Class", "publishedDate": "2013-12-23T00:44:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "05LOodbAbZ4", "description": "VISIT HERE http://yt.g0click.me/herpesyt.html\n\nhow do you get rid of herpes whitlow Rather, a reminder in the torment they are soon to undergo, though for people who experience allergies, the sight of blooming flowers is not really a nice one.

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.\n\nDota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the \"Ancient\", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.\n\nEach match of Dota 2 takes place on a functionally symmetrical map that features the strongholds of two warring factions, the Radiant and the Dire. The Radiant is based at the southwest corner of the map, while the Dire is based at the northeast corner; the two sides are divided by a river that runs perpendicular to the central lane. These factions are defended by up to five players each, and are pitted against one another to compete as the defenders for their respective Ancient. In each stronghold is a critical structure called the \"Ancient\", a fountain that provide health and lesser structures. These bases are connected by three paths, referred to as \"lanes\" \u2013 two run parallel with the edges of the map, while one runs directly between the two bases. The lanes are guarded by defensive Towers, as well as autonomous characters called \"creeps\", which periodically spawn in groups and traverse the lanes, attacking enemies they encounter. Featured across the map are hostile characters referred to as \"neutrals\", which are not aligned to either faction and are primarily located in the forests. Located in a tarn on the northeast side of the river is a \"boss\" called \"Roshan\", who typically requires multiple team members to kill and drops powerful items.\n\nRoyalty Free Music by\nhttp://audiomicrocom/royalty-free-music\n\nSound Effects by\nhttp://audiomicrocom/sound-effects", "title": "Dota 2 - Dragonfist plays Templar Assassin vol 1# 7409 MMR - Ranked Match !", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T01:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "05Ntgt4qOwg", "description": "Take the two hand tapping technique even further by taking advantage of an acoustic guitar body to incorporate percussive tones.

The problem is that many people don't really understand what this means and, as such, don't know that these opportunities exist for better choice and better service. With such a large group of people who could potentially benefit from energy deregulation, it's unfortunate that only a few people truly understand what this means. It is also evident in the number of energy deregulation states that offer a choice as opposed to the states that don't.\n\nWhether you're talking about gas deregulation or electricity deregulation, one thing that states who have deregulated energy do seem to understand are the benefits of offering its citizens a choice when it comes to their energy providers.\n\nTop Energy Deregulation State's Benefits\nThe first and most obvious aspect of deregulation of energy is it leads to better prices. That's common anytime competition is introduced into a monopolized market. When energy is not deregulated, people simply have no other option and it leaves the energy provider to charge whatever prices they see fit.\n\nNot only can energy deregulation help prices, but as it relates to the green energy movement today. Deregulation states are positioning themselves to have not only more options, but greener options for energy as well. If a group of consumers has a choice as to who they get their power from, and those consumers are more green minded than others, they can do business with an energy provider that offers these environmentally friendly energy options. This allows the green energy providers to grow quicker than it would in areas where energy hasn't been deregulated.\n\nIt's fairly easy to see that people who live in deregulation states have much better options for their energy providers. These options allow these energy consumers to pay less and to be much more choosy about who they get their power from. They can choose companies that fall in line with their social as well as economic beliefs or not. The choice is theirs, which is precisely what energy deregulation is really all about.\n\nTags:\nderegulation, energy, power, electricity, electric deregulation, Energy Deregulation, electricity deregulation scam, california deregulation scam, ontario deregulation, Texas deregulation, scam power, global warming, green energy, climate change, solar energy, California, Texas, Clean Environment, Free Wind Generator, Black Box Media,The Electric Choice, History of Energy Deregulat\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/my_videos_edit?ns=1&video_id=05VkYB9fr9M", "title": "Energy Deregulation  | Energy Deregulation States", "publishedDate": "2012-06-03T17:35:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "05W2o3DoVKw", "description": "La Page Facebook pour se tenir au courant http://facebook.com/benzaieTV\net surtout: ABONNEZ-VOUS LES ZOUZOUS !\n\nRDV les 8-9-10 JUIN \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans pour les Geek Faeries !\n\nProchaine Chrono-Critique: Berserk Golden Age 1\nProchain Hard Corner: Le Virtual Boy", "title": "Prometheus - Chrono-Critique (par Benzaie)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-30T04:14:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "05WS0WN7zMQ", "description": "", "title": "R.

This superficially eel-like fish feeds on crustaceans, sea urchins, mussels, clams and some fishes, crushing them with its strong jaws. It can grow to be 203 cm (80 in), 18.6 kg (41 lb), and is found in the northern Pacific Ocean, ranging from the Sea of Japan and the Aleutian Islands to northern California. The wolf eel makes its home on rocky reefs or stony bottom shelves from shallow to moderate depths, picking a territory in a crevice, den or lair in the rocks. Large wolf eels are curious and friendly and are rarely aggressive, but are capable of inflicting painful bites on humans.[3] They have edible, tasty, white flesh.

H\u00e4ufig wir er mit seinem nahen Verwandten, dem Wei\u00dfen Maulbeerbaum (M. alba L.) verwechselt. Nur die Bl\u00e4tter des Wei\u00dfen Maulbeerbaumes dienen jedoch den Seidenraupen als Nahrung. Die gestielten l\u00e4nglichen, fade schmeckenden Fr\u00fcchte des Wei\u00dfen Maulbeerbaums gleichen denen der Brombeere. Die Fr\u00fcchte des Schwarzen Maulbeerbaums hingegen sind gro\u00df und stiellos. Unreife Fr\u00fcchte schmecken sehr sauer, erst mit der Vollreife nehmen sie einen angenehmen sauers\u00fc\u00dfen Geschmack an. Der Schwarze Maulbeerbaum wurde schon fr\u00fch aus Vorderasien in den Mittelmeerraum gebracht. Da er immer reichlich nach Himbeeren duftende Fr\u00fcchte trug, war der Schwarze Maulbeerbaum bei Griechen und R\u00f6mern sehr beliebt. Man findet den Schwarzen Maulbeerbaum heute jedoch nur noch selten.\n\nDie Maulbeeren enthalten etwa 10 Prozent Zucker, leider sind sie nicht besonders vitaminreich. Das Maulbeergelee schmeckt aber ausgezeichnet, und Maulbeersirup ist besonders bei Kindern sehr beliebt. Ein Aufguss von Maulbeerbl\u00e4ttern wurde fr\u00fcher gegen hohes Fieber und Verstopfung verabreicht. In den Balkanl\u00e4ndern gelten die Bl\u00e4tter des Schwarzen Maulbeerbaums als antidiabetisches Mittel.\nWirkung der Heilpflanze / Heilwirkung - Maulbeerbaum\n\nabf\u00fchrend, adstringierend, antidiabetisch, erfrischend\nAnwendung mit der Heilkraft dieser Pflanze\n\nDer Maulbeerbaum wird in der Pflanzenheilkunde innerlich und \u00e4u\u00dferlich angewendet.

They also find it difficult to throw out splinters; they yield to foreign bodies, until they are give potentised Silica to wake up their dormant resistive powers. In Silica persons, these intrinsic 'resistive powers', although quiescent, are great: enough, for instance, to stimulate the body to throw out embedded shrapnel from old war wounds. We see this in the mental sphere also where the physical properties are mirrored. Silica people are outwardly mild and seemingly yielding, yet have an inner resistance; they stand firm, and may obstinately maintain their point of view. They do this because of inner determination as much as a concern about what others may think about them: that the image they project should be perfect. Adults and also children can give us a refined, almost aristocratic impression: inwardly assured (hard) yet outwardly polite (yielding). This characteristic can remind us of Staphisagria. Whenever there is a possibility of their image being lost, for instance while appearing on stage or meeting new people, or at the time of exams, Silica people develop tremendous anxiety with a great fear of failure. Silica may appear like Lycopodium, because Lycopodium also has lack of confidence. But in Lycopodium, it is whether they are capable of doing the action that bothers them, while in Silica it is their image that must be protected at all costs. Silica people are always conscious of the impression they are creating. This can make them fidgety, or they may give rehearsed answers, giving the impression that they are formal. They are apt to be overly conscientious about trifling matters: great at calculation, work with precision, obsessive attention to just one detail. Silica comes in after prolonged mental overload; people who push themselves to the utmost with stubborn perseverance to fulfil a specific task. \nwww.homeopathyschool.com.

Coast Guard air crew were able to safely pick up Reza Baluchi and the bubble Saturday morning, Coast Guard spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said in a statement. He was transported to a nearby Coast Guard station and found to be uninjured, Fajardo said. A statement on Baluchi's website said the Iranian exile had planned to make the 1,033-mile trip in his self-designed bubble to raise money \"for children in need\" and \"to ... inspire those that have lost hope for a better future.\" Baluchi has made headlines many times before with previous efforts to break long-distance running and cycling records , including one six-month journey in which he ran around the perimeter of the United States, and a seven-year bike trip that he said brought him across 55 countries on six continents. His self-professed mission is to promote world peace and unity. His perimeter run was to raise money for a children's hospital, according to his website. Baluchi was granted asylum in the United States in 2003 after being arrested in Iran for so-called pro-Western and anti-Islamic activities, including eating during the holy month of Ramadan, according to his lawyer at the time, Suzannah Maclay. Baluchi served 1 1/2 years in jail for associating with \"counterrevolutionaries\" and was hung from a tree by handcuffs for carrying a prohibited movie, Maclay said.

Sorry about that :(\n\nI have a couple more things to add on: \n\n1. My airline is allowing me to check in one \"big\" suitcase and allowing me to bring a carry-on and a 'purse' with my person onto the plane. In my carry-on, I plan on carrying all of the 'valuables.' This includes gifts, travel documents, Rotary pins, underwear, a spare outfit\u2014 anything I do not want to lose. This is because the carry-on will always stay with me. In the larger suitcase I have all of my clothes, shoes and miscellaneous items I don't mind losing, since I am checking it in. Finally, for my 'purse,' I'm taking my white Adventure-Backpack filled with Mandarin workbooks, Passport/Visa, iPod, laptop and journal.\n\n2. This applies to Asia and possibly other continents. I have been told by fellow Rebounds that in Asia, deodorant is very popular in it's aerosol form. Also if you shave, razors are apparently sold but possibly not the brand you could be fond of. I personally am packing deodorant and razors. \n\n3. Though I am packing all of these products, I am not taking enough to last me for an entire year. My mom and I have mutually decided to send me care packages when needed. This was a decision made due to medicine I was not allowed to be supplied a years' worth of. Since my mom has to send me medicine every once in a while, she decided to send other products I might need as well. This also saves on weight. \n\n4. Just because you aren't going to Taiwan, does not mean you shouldn't pack lightly. Regardless of what your country is, you're most likely going to want to buy whatever teenagers where there. Save the space for when you come back.\n\n5. For the things you do choice to pack, make sure it's also appropriate for the temperature and climate of your country.\n\nIf your questions have yet to be answered, don't be afraid to ask questions. Since I am leaving for my trip tomorrow, I might be slow on responses but I will try my very best. By then I might even have more knowledge on this subject.

But, as the voice-over narrator of this on-edge film noir notes, \"One day the world's all right. The next, it's nowhere.\" Nice-guy Donovan's life quickly begins to unravel. He's wrongly suspected of grand larceny at the bank, hounded by a dogged insurance investigator convinced of his guilt and loses his job and home. Is there any way he can stop his free fall? As the insurance shamus determined to crush Donovan, Charles McGraw (The Narrow Margin, Armored Car Robbery) glares and growls in the style that helped make him one of the icons of noir. Dorothy Malone plays Donovan's supportive wife. And, in solid noir tradition, Mary Beth Hughes is sizzling blonde ice as an avaricious femme fatale. \n------\n1,000+ Rare films, TV movies, and series on DVD direct from the Studio.\nhttp://www.warnerarchive.com", "title": "Loophole (Preview Clip)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-25T00:04:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "064ipuBiWDg", "description": "Med ditt st\u00f6d kan forskningen forts\u00e4tta g\u00f6ra framsteg.

Its primary roles are troop movement, artillery placement and battlefield resupply. It has a wide loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage and three external-cargo hooks. With a top speed of 170 knots (196 mph, 315 km/h) the helicopter is faster than contemporary utility and attack helicopters of the 1960s. The CH-47 is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters. Its name is from the Native American Chinook people.\nThe Chinook was designed and initially produced by Boeing Vertol in the early 1960s; it is now produced by Boeing Rotorcraft Systems. It is one of the few aircraft of that era -- along with the fixed-wing Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft -- that remain in production and front-line service, with over 1,179 built to date. The helicopter has been sold to 16 nations with the U.S. Army and the Royal Air Force (see Boeing Chinook (UK variants)) its largest users.\n\nGrand Theft Auto V is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 17 September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is the fifteenth title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008. As one of the last titles to release exclusively during the seventh generation of video game consoles, Grand Theft Auto V was highly anticipated preceding its release.[8]\nGrand Theft Auto V is played in from a third-person perspective and combines driving and action gameplay in an open world environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The game is set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on Southern California) and affords the player the ability to freely roam the world's countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). The single-player story is told through three player-controlled protagonists whom the player switches between, and it follows their efforts to plan and execute six large heists to accrue wealth for themselves. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\nThe developers envisioned Grand Theft Auto V as a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects, such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. Development began shortly following the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, with a focus on innovating the core mechanic of the series by giving the player control of three protagonists. Upon release, the game was acclaimed by many reviewers who praised its story, presentation and open-ended gameplay. A commercial success, Grand Theft Auto V broke industry sales records by earning US $800 million in the first 24 hours of its release, and $1 billion within its first three days, making it the fastest selling entertainment product in history.", "title": "GTA 5: CRAZY FUN  MILITARY HELICOPTER Cargobob (CH 47 Chinook) Gameplay Review", "publishedDate": "2013-09-21T14:12:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "06IYfbwHgHo", "description": "Calibration Demonstration on the EZ Zahn Viscosity Cup.", "title": "EZ Zahn Viscosity Cup Demo", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T17:31:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "06JP54z5qZE", "description": "This presentation describes about the best herbal acne pills - read in-depth Glisten Plus capsule review.

Hypermobility Disorders are connective tissue disorders which cause increase tissue extensibility. They are characterized by  ligamentous laxity, a propensity for bruising, poor scarring. Children may have coordination issues, joint pain, greater incidence of growing pains and many small bruises in various stages of healing in \"high contact\" areas such as shins and forearms. Other children are very coordinated but suffer from frequent sprains, strains and/or tendinopathies.\n\nClient LM was 4 years old at the time of the footage. His parents were concerned for his safety in playground activities because he was tripping over frequently when running at speeds. He was profoundly tired at the end of the school day and was complaining of pain in his shins at night. LM has ligamentous laxity in the hips causing excessive internal rotation of the hips. He also had weak gluteus medius muscles and pelvic stabilizers and over-pronated (flat) feet. In this video you can also see that he lifts his first toe prominently to assist with foot placement. \n\nThe Spiral Thigh Brace was recommended in conjunction with a specific program of core and pelvic stability exercises, lower limb strengthening and proprioceptive exercises to assist in correction of the pigeon toe gait. With the Spiral Thigh Brace insitu, LM's legs are in a more neutral position and the feet are orientated in a more parallel fashion (less pigeon toed). In use of the brace for musculo-skeletal disorders the Spiral Thigh Brace is worn 4-5 hours a day in the period of the day when the child is most active, for a period of months. The principle behind this is that regardless of how many exercises a child does to strengthen the hips, they have already developed an ingrained gait or pattern of walking. The brace provides biofeedback to assist the child to create new motor \"memories\" and become accustomed to a new, more biomechanically efficient, pattern of movement for walking and running.", "title": "Spiral Thigh Brace for Benign Joint Hypermobility Disorder", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T23:25:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "06Lo47J3PG0", "description": "One of the best buys in Bear's Paw.

El equipo espa\u00f1ol estuvo a peor nivel que el Benfica, que no supo transformar en gol las numerosas ocasiones que tuvo y que lo pag\u00f3 muy caro en la loter\u00eda de la tanda de penaltis. (Vea aqu\u00ed fotos de Carlos Bacca en la final de la Liga de Europa)\n\nLos pron\u00f3sticos daban como favorito al equipo que dirige Jorge Jes\u00fas, que se present\u00f3 en la final despu\u00e9s de eliminar a rivales de peso como el Tottenham ingl\u00e9s o en las mismas semifinales al Juventus, pero porque adem\u00e1s llegaba como campe\u00f3n de la Liga lusa, de la Copa de la Liga y clasificado para jugar tambi\u00e9n la final de la Copa de Portugal.\n\nNo obstante, exist\u00eda la duda del rendimiento con ausencias destacadas por lesi\u00f3n, como la del defensa luso S\u00edlvio y del centrocampista serbio Ljubomir Fejsa, as\u00ed como la de los sancionados, el argentino Enzo P\u00e9rez, su habitual organizador, el tambi\u00e9n argentino Eduardo Salvio, hombre importante en misiones de ataque, y del media punta serbio Lazar Markovic.\n\nAun as\u00ed, el equipo lisboeta tom\u00f3 el mando del partido y exigi\u00f3 mucho al conjunto que entrena Unai Emery, que pronto vio c\u00f3mo dos jugadores se cargaron con tarjetas amarillas, el central argentino Federico Fazio y el lateral izquierdo Alberto Moreno, \u00e9ste por una fuerte entrada sobre el serbio Miralem Sulejmani que incluso motiv\u00f3 que el jugador del Benfica fuera sustituido poco despu\u00e9s por Andr\u00e9 Almeida.\n\nEl portero portugu\u00e9s del Sevilla, Antonio Alberto Bastos 'Beto', tuvo que tapar huecos por la presencia peligrosa del central argentino Ezequiel Garay antes de que se cumpliera el cuarto de hora y estar muy atento contra un rival que iba a por el partido. La formaci\u00f3n andaluza, con un claro esquema de arroparse atr\u00e1s y de buscar la oportunidad con la visi\u00f3n de juego del croata Iv\u00e1n Rakitic y la definici\u00f3n del colombiano Carlos Bacca, nunca estuvo a gusto sobre el c\u00e9sped y tambi\u00e9n pec\u00f3 en exceso de imprecisiones que le daban vida al adversario.\n\nAs\u00ed, ya en los \u00faltimos minutos de la primera mitad, Beto tuvo que intervenir con acierto en dos ocasiones casi consecutivas del Benfica que no se tradujeron el gol, adem\u00e1s de que en los \u00faltimos lances los 'ag\u00fcilas' reclamaron un penalti de Fazio al argentino Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n que el \u00e1rbitro alem\u00e1n Felix Brych no consider\u00f3 y que hubiera supuesto la expulsi\u00f3n del central sevillista.\n\nLa segunda parte empez\u00f3 como acab\u00f3 la primera, con verdaderos agobios de los espa\u00f1oles en la defensa ante el empuje de los portugueses, que tuvieron claras ocasiones pero que no supieron traducirlas en goles. El centro del campo fue del Benfica y el ataque con las bandas constante, pero ese dominio le pudo tambi\u00e9n costar caro en alguna incursi\u00f3n del adversario, como en un bal\u00f3n que lleg\u00f3 a Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes y que no supo definir ante la salida del meta esloveno Jan Oblak.\n\nPoco poder del Sevilla frente a una defensa con jerarqu\u00eda con los centrales Garay y el brasile\u00f1o Luisao y con dos jugadores arriba s muy r\u00e1pidos y peligrosos como el hispanobrasile\u00f1o Rodrigo Moreno y el brasile\u00f1o Lima. El tiempo corri\u00f3 a favor del Sevilla con el 0-0 en la misma medida que las ansias de ganar del Benfica, lo que produjo algunos huecos por donde los hispalenses crearon peligro y equilibraron algo la contienda mediado el segundo per\u00edodo.\n\nAs\u00ed se entr\u00f3 al \u00faltimo cuarto de hora, en el que ya un tanto parec\u00eda que pod\u00eda ser definitivo, como pudo llegar en un remate de Lima con parad\u00f3n de Beto o un cabezazo de Garay que se le fue fuera en un tramo final de asedio lisboeta que no tuvo \u00e9xito y que dio paso a una pr\u00f3rroga con dos equipos muy cansados pero, como en todo el partido, con m\u00e1s intenciones de los portugueses pese a que Bacca tuvo una clar\u00edsima que desperdici\u00f3 solo ante Oblak en el minuto 101.\n\nLa segunda parte de la pr\u00f3rroga tuvo poca historia, con todos sobre el terreno fundidos por el desgaste, con constantes calambres musculares y tambi\u00e9n atenazados por el miedo a perder, con lo que se dio paso a la tanda de lanzamientos desde el punto de penalti, que se produjo en la porter\u00eda donde estaban los seguidores sevillistas.\n\nEl Sevilla entonces hizo un pleno de cuatro transformaciones, con la definitiva del franc\u00e9s Kevin Gameiro y el Benfica logr\u00f3 dos y tuvo los fallos de Rodrigo y el paraguayo \u00d3scar Cardozo ante la buena respuesta de Beto, con lo que el trofeo se lo adjudic\u00f3 el equipo espa\u00f1ol.", "title": "Bacca, con Sevilla, se coron\u00f3 campe\u00f3n de la Liga de Europa", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T22:24:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "06TPrud8GJ4", "description": "", "title": "PREPARATION &PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BENZENE", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T07:50:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "06TsQxQQnxc", "description": "\u7cf8\u3092\u96e2\u3057\u305f\u3089\u98db\u3093\u3067\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3002\n\u7cf8\u4ed8\u3051\u305f\u307e\u307e\u3067\u3000\u304b\u308f\u3044\u305d\u3046\u306a\u4e8b\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3002", "title": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30d6\u30f3\u304c\u98db\u3093\u3067\u3063\u305f\uff01\uff01", "publishedDate": "2014-07-15T13:44:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "06TvD-n3nBk", "description": "This video is about Walker Ambulation", "title": "Walker Ambulation", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T18:05:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "06UNiwzsb4o", "description": "Brave Frontier replay\n\nRecorded and uploaded with Kamcord (http://kamcord.com/v/gF27Tk7OnZz/).", "title": "Brave Frontier: Blistering Cave - The Truncheon Wielding Warrior", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T03:41:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "06URCstiUAs", "description": "\"Halloween\" - When the other Titans say they\u2019re over Halloween, Raven conjures the Halloween Spirit to give them a good fright.\n\nWatch new episodes of Teen Titans Go! on Cartoon Network Thursday nights at 6 p.m. (5 p.m. CST).", "title": "Teen Titans Go! - \"Halloween\" (clip)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T18:15:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "06UqcPiMr3I", "description": "", "title": "Edwin el Maestro El Hechizo Champetas del Momento", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T00:54:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "06UrDbeMKe0", "description": "Brigham Young University's International Award Winning Formation Team\nFri, Jun 08, 2012 | 7:30 PM\nhttp://www.fairfieldacc.com/events/capture-the-magic-2012-06-08.html\n\nPrepare to be awed and amazed as you witness breath-taking lifts, stunning spins, unbelievable energy, shimmering costumes, precious moves and inspiring, championship formations performed by the internationally traveled Brigham Young University Ballroom Dance Company on Friday, June 8 at 7:30 p.m. here at the Sondheim Center.\n\nThe dance team has known victory and acclaim throughout the world since its formation in 1971, and is last year'sBritish National Champion and this year's USA Champion in both Ballroom formation and Latin formation dance.

It is regarded widely as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language.[2][3][4][5][6] The Quran is divided into 114 suras of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan or Medinan depending upon their place and time of revelation.[7]\nMuslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through angel Jibr\u012bl (Gabriel) from God toMuhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning in 610 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.[1][8][9] Muslims further believe that the Qur'an was precisely memorized, recited and exactly written down by Muhammad's companions (Sahaba) after each revelation was dictated by him.[citation needed]\nShortly after Muhammad's death the Quran was compiled into a single book by order of the firstCaliph Abu Bakr and at the suggestion of his future successor Umar. Hafsa, Muhammad's widow and Umar's daughter, was entrusted with that Quranic text after the second Caliph Umar died.[10] When the third Caliph Uthman began noticing slight differences in Arabic dialect, he sought Hafsa's permission to use her text to be set as the standard dialect, the Quraish dialect now known as Fus'ha (Modern Standard Arabic). Before returning the text to Hafsa, Uthman made several thousand copies of Abu Bakr's redaction and, to standardize the text, invalidated all other versions of the Quran. This process of formalization is known as the \"Uthmanic recension\".[11] The present form of the Quran text is accepted by most scholars as the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.[11][12]\nMuslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood[13]and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed toAdam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet,[14] and continued with the Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham),[15] the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses,[16][17] the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David,[18][19] and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus.[20][21][22] The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events.[23][24][25] The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.\nAbdul Rahman Ibn Abdul Aziz as-Sudais (Arabic: \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f\u064a\u0633 (\u02bbAbd ar-Rahman ibn \u02bbAbd al-Aziz as-Sudais), born Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1960)[1] is the imam of the Grand mosque inMecca, Saudi Arabia, and the \"Islamic Personality Of the Year\" 2005. In some of his sermons, al-Sudais has vilified non-Muslims and has called for the annihilation of Jews.\nAbu Ibrahim Sa'ud ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ash-Shuraim An-Najdi Ph.d is one of theImams of the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah. His family is from the Haraqees of the Banu Zayd tribe of Saudi Arabia. He studied elementary at Areen schools, then the middle school at the Modern schools then high school at Al Yarmouk North. During last years of his secondary school he became a hafiz of the Quran. He graduated from his high school in 1983, then went to college of `Usool ud Din` at Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, in the \"Aqeedah and Modern Madhahib\" division, from where he graduated in 1988. Then he went on in 1989 to the \"Ma'had Al-'aali Lilqadhah\" institute and received a Masters degree in 1992.", "title": "100-Surah Al-\u02bf\u0100diya\u0101t (Courser)with English Translation (Complete Quran) Al-Sudais & Al-Shuraim", "publishedDate": "2012-04-23T19:14:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "06aMX_hA8Mk", "description": "\u6c38\u61b2\u8d77\u8096", "title": "\u6c38\u61b2\u8d77\u8096", "publishedDate": "2007-06-27T16:07:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "06aOkdBozuk", "description": "New Year, new you right?

He said the tabloid press had decided he was guilty.\n\nMs Church, 25, said the NoW had already published a story talking about her mother's mental health, \"so they knew how vulnerable she was but still published the story\".\n\n\"I just really hated the fact that my parents who had never been in this industry - apart from looking after me - were being exposed and vilified in this fashion.\n\n\"It just had a massive impact on my mother's health, her mental health, her hospital treatment - the only way they know about that was either through the hacking or the bribing of hospital staff.\"\n\nMs Church said at first she had been treated with kid gloves when she became famous aged 12, dubbed \"The Voice of an Angel\". But she said she had experienced \" the \"worst excess of the press\" between the ages of 16 to 20.\n\nShe told the hearing paparazzi had taken pictures up her skirt, there were photographers outside her house on most days and her manager had found evidence of a camera hidden in a shrub outside her home. \n\nMs Church said she had been \"totally appalled\" by a clock on the Sun's website which counted down to her 16th birthday, an \"innuendo\" highlighting the fact she was reaching the age of sexual consent, she said.\n\n\"It was just horrible, I was a 16 year-old-girl and was uncomfortable with it,\" she said.\n\nThe inquiry heard how the Sun had published a story about her being pregnant for the first time before she had told her family.\n\nShe said she believed journalists had obtained their information through hacking voicemail messages from the doctor or through other surveillance, although added she did not have any evidence.\n\n\"I had not told anyone apart from when I had gone to have my initial scan. I can't see how it came from any other area. My family were really upset that I had not told them first,\" she said.\n\nMs Church said newspaper coverage adversely affected her career as it was difficult for her to be taken seriously as her credibility had been \"blown to bits\".\n\nMs Church said she had attended the inquiry because she did not want her children to go through the same thing.\n\n\"A lot of this happened to me whilst I was a minor and whilst I was really very young. It was really hard and it has had a psychological effect upon me. It almost feels like they put you through this psychological grinding, test your strength, and you come out the other side and it just keeps happening.\"\n\nThanks to the BBC\n\nMonday 28th November 2011", "title": "Leveson Inquiry: Charlotte Church - My Family's Torment At Hands Of Press", "publishedDate": "2011-11-28T16:38:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "06vyMRBv2zA", "description": "Leave a comment and SUBSCRIBE! \\m/^_^\\m/ To get the mp3, backingtrack and more go to: http://patreon.com/pellekofficial\n\nAll my covers and original songs on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/artist/pellek/id411708930\nBuy merch and signed PelleK-albums at http://pellek.com\nMy Facebook Profile: http://facebook.com/imPelleK\nPelleK's Facebook Page: http://facebook.com/pellekofficial\nMy twitter: http://twitter.com/imPelleK\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/realpellek\n\nI hope you like this video and consider sharing it with your friends.

Examine the focus words to be covered in this lesson during the intro song and then we'll get on with the lesson.\n\nMost animals make some kind of sound and in this lesson we will talk a little bit about a few of the sounds made by common animals you may encounter from time to time.\n\nIn fact, the first animal sound that we'll talk about is the bark of a dog and the word for bark is \u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c. Interestingly, \u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c can also mean to scold or to rebuke. Here's a quick sample sentence for \u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c:\n\u0415\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445.\n(His dog barks at everybody.)\nThe following sample sentence shows a past tense form of \u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c:\n\u041e\u043d \u043b\u0430\u044f\u043b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0430.\n(He barked like a dog.)\n\nThe Russian word for the sound made by a cat is \u043c\u044f\u0443. However, the verb which means to meow is \u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c and the noun for meow is \u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435. Here are a couple sentences to illustrate these words.\n\u0415\u0451 \u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043a\u043e.\n(Her cat meows loudly.)\n\u041c\u044b \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n(We heard the  meowing of the cat.)\n\nNext up is the topic of cows and the sound which they produce. The Russian verb meaning to moo is \u043c\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c and the noun which means moo is \u043c\u044b\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. You probably recall the \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 is the Russian word for cow, which brings up the following question.\n\u0412\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430?\n(Can you moo like a cow?)\n\nYou probably recall that the Russian word for farmer is \u0444\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 and that the Russian word for pig is \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044c\u044f, but you may not know that \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c means to squeal. Utilizing these words the following sentence may be constructed.\n\u0424\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0436\u0430\u043b \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044c\u044f.\n(The farmer squealed like a pig.)\n\nFinally the sound that a duck makes in Russian is \u043a\u0440\u044f-\u043a\u0440\u044f and the verb which means to quack is \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c in the imperfective form and  \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c in the perfective. It's also worth noting that the noun which means quack is \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435, just in case you were wondering. In any case, the following sample sentence shows \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c in the past tense:\n\u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u044f\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438.\n(The children quacked like little ducks.)\nBTW and FYI, the Russian word for duckling is \u0443\u0442\u0451\u043d\u043e\u043a and oddly enough ducklings would be \u0443\u0442\u044f\u0442\u0430 as in:\n\u0414\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u044f\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0442\u044f\u0442\u0430.\n(The children quacked like ducklings.)\n\nAnd now for some bonus sentences:\n\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435. (The lion roared at the monkey.)\n\u041c\u044b \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u044b\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044f. (We heard the bear growl.)\n\u0429\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0447\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0435\u0451. (The chirping birds annoyed her.)\n\u041b\u044f\u0433\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c\u044e. (Frogs croak at night.)\n\nThe focus words for this lesson include:\n\u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c (to bark)\n\u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c (to meow)\n\u043c\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c (to moo)\n\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c (to squeal)\n\u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c (to quack)", "title": "Speaking Russian 15 - \u043a\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u044f\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c", "publishedDate": "2013-01-05T23:52:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "07CDjVZZhcU", "description": "Columbus, Ohio attorney Michael Anthony explains the benefits of forming a Single Member Limited Liability Company (LLC) to protect your business.\n\nFor relevant information for your small business, follow us on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/anthonylawllc\n\nLike on us Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Anthony-Law-LLC/157006090986481\n\nFind us on Google Plus\nhttps://plus.google.com/114930153967577121641#114930153967577121641/posts\n\nAnthony Law LLC\nhttp://www.anthonylawllc.com/Home.aspx\n\nAnthony Law represents small to medium size businesses in Columbus, Ohio, and the surrounding communities of Dublin, Powell, Westerville, Worthington, Hilliard, New Albany, Gahanna, Grove City, Upper Arlington, and Bexley and the counties of Delaware, Licking, and Fairfield.

Lets hope its for the better, though. I don't believe that it will be for the worse no matter what happens. If Scotland gains\nIndependence we will just become trading partners and get along fine.  I am predicting a Yes Win by a 65% yes votes against a 35% lose.  We will see. Anyway the best of luck to both Scotland and England for the future.   Best wishes  BRI - DAR\n22/09/14\nHello again , I am for peace and harmony whatever happens. As People, Humans if you like\nwe have evolved over the years and become civilized in spite of ourselves.  Perhaps we should bear in mind that we the humankind were savages ourselves and did not show any mercy to others, no more than they would to us. So lets keep putting that  civility to good use\nand find a way to live together regardless of Borders.\n22/9/14  Hello again You know what, the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which took effect on\n1st January 1993, was an event that saw the self determined split of the federal state of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, entities which had arisen respectively as the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic in1969 within the framework of Czechoslovak federalisation.\nIt is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989 that led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia of a democratic government.  It worked for them.\nLets talk about Rhodesia.  Mr Smith made the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI)\nAfter days of tense negotiations with Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The Rhodesian Government ruled Rhodesia with an impeccable record for over 40 years and were denied what was freely granted to other Countries.  Do you think another Labour Government let\nthe side down. And now the Labour Party have promised you all another minimum wage of\n\u00a38 an hour in a few years, Ha I suppose that's to keep up with inflation.  When the no campaign are let down  by ALL  THE  POLITICAL  PARTIES once more I can suggest a way out .  (Join the YESs) and declare (UDI)     Good Luck To You All and Stick Together.\nBRI - DAR\ndeclare (UDI)\n\n\n\n\nWell, Well, I could not have got it more wrong . With My 65% Yes by 35% No, now could I.  \nPerhaps sometime in the future.  Please don't be negative but make the best of the situation.\nIt could be worse if we didn't have democracy we would not have a free vote at all,\nIt cant be all that bad.  Being Irish myself and living here for over 50 Years. So lets make the best of it together, be happy together as one.Dont fall out with your old friends.

Usher is known for his big movements and his smooth glides. So I'm going to teach you guys a combination that incorporates both of those that you can practice on your own. You're going to start by stepping left, right. You're going to go ball exchange, a one, you're going to step forward two. You're going to jump out and you 're going to cross your left foot in front of your right, three.\n\nNotice how I brought this arm in front to prepare for this turn. From here I'm going to take this arm and I'm going to use it to pull around, I'm going to unwind my feet and face the side. From here I'm going to take my front leg, step it out, then I'm going to switch my feet. When you switch your feet, you don't want to just step and step, you want to use your toes to make this smooth.\n\nSo as I step back, I go under the toe of this foot, then lower down slowly as I step out with my back foot. From here we are going to do a roll to the front, but we are going to isolate it. I'm going to start with my chest and upper body. So my chest is going front and around to bring my legs around after. Let's try and put that first eight count together. We have six, seven, eight. This goes a one, two and three, this is your prep, turn, four. Step your right foot out, five, switch your feet, six, pull to the front, seven, unwind your legs, eight.\n\nWhen I release my legs, I'm going up on my toes again to bring my knees around to the front. From here I'm going to step my left foot in to meet my right and I'm going to body roll down. You want to create the illusion that this left foot stepping in causes your chest to go up to start this roll. As you finish this roll, you're going to bring your right knee up, then you're going to use your right leg kicking back to help you slide back on your left foot. \n\nThe further you travel back with this step, the more impressive it's going to look. So use this leg and really kick hard to travel. From here you're going to step this right foot back down in front and we're going to go into Usher's signature glide. So this is a little take on what Michael Jackson used to do and instead of gliding straight to the back, we're going to go in a circle. I'm going to start by going up on to my right toe.\n\nFrom here, I'm going to push my left foot out and turn my toes so that they are facing away from each other. From here I'm going to bring my right foot in and shift my weight over to my left foot, gliding my right foot in. We're then going to go back up on to the right toe and continue this process all the way around. Pushing our left foot out, shifting our weight, bringing our right foot in. Right toe, shift our weight, bring our right foot in. When we get all the way back to where we started, we're just going to finish with a little groove.\n\nLet's try to put that all together. We have five, six, seven, eight, ball exchange, two and three, turn four, right, left, chest, legs step together, roll down and three, four, you glide five, six, seven, eight, we bounce one, two, three, four. The groove at the end is up to you, just freestyle it. Have a good time. Practice that; and this is how you dance like Usher.", "title": "How to Dance like Usher | Hip-Hop How-to", "publishedDate": "2012-02-07T22:54:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "07fA0ujlOVs", "description": "7 CHEM EL SHAARAWY THE BEAST! - FIFA 15 Ultimate Team, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team player review, FIFA 15 7 Chem Players, FIFA 15 Cheap wingers as strikers,\n\n- FIFA 15 \"Pack Openings\" - http://goo.gl/HjaeVV\n- FIFA 15 \"The Best Team in FIFA\" - http://goo.gl/o1UEVR\n- FIFA 15 \"Club Tours\" http://goo.gl/Tbdblb\n- FIFA 15 \"The Ultimate Team RTG\" - http://goo.gl/8UFQFW\n- FIFA 14 \"The Best Team in FIFA\" - http://goo.gl/eIH8JZ\n\n\n- For Xbl / PSN / Msp and other game gold go to\n\n- - - http://www.thefutshop.com\n\nAnd use the code \"NEPPO\" for a discount on your coins!\n\n- Captured with Elgato Game Capture HD - http://e.lga.to/n", "title": "7 CHEM EL SHAARAWY THE BEAST! - FIFA 15 Ultimate Team", "publishedDate": "2014-11-14T19:00:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "07fcEiOjLIU", "description": "Recently Russia has provided the Iraqis with Su-25 attack aircraft, which were delivered in June 2014.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "Billy Hamilton beats out grounder to first base?
