Disney Frozen Queen Elsa and Disney Princess Anna dress up in Barbie's clothes as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty's Aurora, Astronaut Barbie, Dentist Barbie, Belle from Disney Beauty and The Beast, Barbie Wedding Gowns with 3 wedding dresses, Barbie wedding PJs, Cheerleader Barbie and Cinderella Barbie clothes. At the end of the video, Disney Princess Anna tries to wear Elsa's dress but doesn't get away with it. Elsa and Anna are told by Barbie to not try on any clothes when the house sit / closet sit. But the first thing Elsa and Anna do is play in the clothes and mock Barbie. It's like a Barbie parody. In the Disney Frozen movie, Elsa is an ice princess. Elsa and her sister Anna are the two main characters in the Disney Frozen movie.

Yet one United Nations agency worries that economic progress is not creating enough jobs for the millions of people seeking employment.  The UN's International Labor Organization is saying current economic growth has not helped the world's unemployed.  The ILO released a report on employment in January.  Guy Ryder of Britain is the Director General of the agency.  He says there were over 200 million people unemployed in 2013: an increase of five million from the year before.  That means new jobs created by economic growth are not keeping up with the number of people entering the job market.\n\nOne question is whether the current period of economic growth is leading to job creation.  The ILO says, based on current information, the world will have 18 million more jobless men and women by 2018.  Many of these are young people between the ages of 15 and 24 who are just entering the job market.  Guy Ryder says youth unemployment is a major concern.  The ILO says youth unemployment worldwide is over 13 percent. \n\nThere has been success in reducing the number of working poor over the past 10 years.  The ILO defines the working poor as individuals earning less than one dollar and 25 cents a day.  However, the group says 839 million people earn less than two dollars or less a day.  That represents one fourth of the global work force.  Low wages, the group says, mean weak demand and fewer jobs created in areas like manufacturing and services.", "title": "Anh ng\u1eef \u0111\u1eb7c bi\u1ec7t: Global Unemployment (VOA-Econ Rep)", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T20:27:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "ArdUr6dk2ls", "description": "http://GetTeaTreeOil.com   -  Opuntia Humifusa Compressa and Tea Tree Oil  - an awesome video showing a plant that you probably don't get to see very often.  \n\nI hope you enjoyed this video  on Opuntia Humifusa Compressa  \n\nUse 40% off Promo Code  40OFFOil  !  \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ToothyGrinsTeaTreeOil   Facebook Page\n\nTea Tree Oil Play List:   http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA4qIJwBzDSM4kY9WT40IAVwtMU5iYv2l\n\nI hope you will leave a comment or join the FB page to have a discussion.

If you've never roller skated before, the biggest thing that you need to worry is balance.  You would think balance is pretty easy, but when you put wheels on your feet, it's not so much.  So the first thing when you put your skates on it's the T position.  So when you have the T position together, it's one heel into the instep of the other skate.  The purpose of doing this is so that your feet are underneath you, knees bent, your core is engaged, and that way your skates won't roll out from underneath you while you're standing there.  So if you're on a hill, talking to a friend, looking at the cute guys or girls walking by, this is a great way to just stand there without having to worry about your feet moving out from underneath you.\n\nThe next thing is forward skating, is with your toes out, and rolling straight is toes straight ahead, forwards or backwards, and backwards skating is toes in.  So it's kind of like a car, when your toes are out you're in drive, when your toes are straight, neutral, toes together, reverse.  So if you start going backwards, just have a quick little glance down, your toes are probably pointing together, so stop, T-position, get your balance back underneath you, knees bent, and start again.  We always start off with walking first because it's kind of difficult just to put skates on and roll, so toes out, knees bent, and walk like a duck.  Small steps forward until you get your balance, and then once you have your balance you'll be able to push to the side and let your wheels roll.\n\nSo those are a couple of tips for you beginners out there, and happy rolling.", "title": "4 Tips for Beginners | Roller-Skate", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T07:36:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "Arp9Xd6Gv4Y", "description": "Deaf Havana frontman James Veck-Gilodi gets his acoustic guitar out in a crapper for the Toilet Circuit, exclusively on Rock Sound TV!\n\n\nRock Sound - the world's greatest music magazine, website and everything in between.

What an absolute sorry excuse for a human being!\n\nI'm Muslim and I think they guys an idiot! Why did he need to provoke her to say things when he could have simply apologised and when he realised she was not responsive to that then he shouldve walked off. He stood there with the camera like an idiot purposely knowing that it would piss anyone off. Shes a racist no doubt but she called him those things because he wasnt the bigger person who just turned his back on her\n\nHow is what he was doing considered patience? Absolutely no excuse for her actions, but he knew he was antagonizing her.  If he did something dangerous on the road to warrant both of them pulling over...her anger is regrettably  understandable, but poorly expressed.  Heated situations like this are not the time to get a camera, point it at the person with whom you want to find mutual points of understanding and say \"calm down\".  Despite his calm voice, he was not being kind or apologetic; he engaged her rage smoothly and methodically, and increased it.  That's fine that he threw her into a rage after being viciously insulted...but how he interacted with her shouldn't be confused for patience.\n\nUff if these people weren't hating on Muslims they'd be hating on black people. If they weren't hating on black people they'd hate on Hispanic people. If they weren't hating on Hispanic people they'd hate Asian people.

But Cross country, I have put her in a fulmer french link bit -her dressage bit, with a kineton noseband and today was the first time xc in it. She would NEVER turn this tight or easily with the gag, to turn her in the gag you had to be 30 strides ahead of her and bring her back to a trot then hope she didnt rear. or leap.

I know at one point I am in her mouth, she was pratting around beneath me and preparing to run out to the side of the jump, so i got into her mouth to get her mind on something else which worked. I know my position is bad as well. But this is my first time xc since last weekend when she and me took a fall and she ended up trampling me. We thought we had both broken a leg, thankfully she is sound and has been since the fall, but I have done some serious muscle damage to my calf.

That led me to Nashville to do another album, (technically my 3rd by this stage) with members of Highway 101 Cactus Moser (drums) and Curtis Stone (Bass). From there I landed a $50K record deal which was fan funded by people across the globe. This gave me the opportunity to perform at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, and perform in London, Portugal, and The Netherlands. The record's name was Diversity, still featuring those same members of Highway 101 and produced by Chris Stamey from the DB's.

The Norwood Range can easily be used to sort regular hair loss designs in men. Typical baldness is divided in to 7 categories as well as sub-categories. Indicate that a Norwood 1 suggests no hair loss.\n\nMale Pattern Hair Reduction is in some cases described as Androgenic Alopecia or Androgenetic Alopecia. The expression Androgenic combines the words androgen and gene, because both androgens as well as a genetic predisposition are thought to bet a role in MPHL. Androgens are hormones, such as testosterone. Miniaturization is a procedure by which hair comes to be smaller and also finer with each progression cycle until at last, it stops expanding altogether. A progressive rise in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is frequently accepted as the root cause of miniaturization. Guy that are genetically prone to MPHL have increased levels of Type II 5 alpha-reductase, an enzyme that transforms testosterone in to DHT.\n\nAll people have DHT yet simply some will deal with baldness, due to the fact that of a hereditary predisposition for hair follicles with a surplus of androgen receptors to which DHT attaches. Over time, DHT induces a constant miniaturization as well as ultimately the death of these prone hair follicles. This activity is mainly inherited. Although anti-androgen medications might slow or stop baldness, they are really simply successful at re-growing hair in the crown.\n\nMale Pattern Hair Loss can be reduced and in some cases impeded by hair loss medications such as Propecia (Finasteride), but the only long-term remedy is hair transplant men surgical procedure. hair transplants for men, hair transplant for men, hair transplants for black men, hair restoration for men, hair implants for men, mens hair transplant\n\nhttp://youtu.be/As9nQvtmk4I\n\nTo know more about us just search about us on either http://google.com or http://google.ca\n\nCheck out our New Youtube Channel for more exciting Hair Transplant Men Videos by Dr. Hasson and Wong: http://www.youtube.com/user/hairtransplantHW\n\nmens hair transplant\nmale hair transplant\nmale hair transplants\nhair transplants men\nhair restoration for men\nmen hair transplant\nhair transplant men", "title": "HAIR TRANSPLANT MEN World Renowned Surgeons For Men Hair Transplants", "publishedDate": "2012-07-26T00:07:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AsA2C7m5giI", "description": "Limonite is basically rust.

One of love, hurt or something in between. It's what 'Nadia' did to producer Andrew Chen. This American born Taiwanese DJ/Producer left his mark upon the dance scene with a residency in the world-famous Ministry of Sound club and his two previous release, 'Panic Room' and 'AT3'. No wonder, after graduating with an Audio Engineering Degree in 2006 and building himself a fully equipped studio, he would soon come out with a few majestic results.\n\nOn 'Nadia', Shogun tells you a story on delicious, frail progressive trance - with a little love-ballad in between. 'Nadia' received its vocal translation by Hanna Ray, a British vocalist that's been singing professionally for ten years already. Her most recent success was a collab with Tritonal on 'Jump Off', and be sure - this lady's got much more coming up. Her soulful, strong voice carries 'Nadia' to a higher level - giving it the full force impact it deserves. Left in memory for a long time to come, this tender-caring, warm progressive tune will surely be one that stands out.\n\nTracks:\n\nNadia (Extended Mix) (08:22)\nNadia (Dub Mix) (08:22)\nNadia (Radio Edit) (03:13)", "title": "Shogun feat.

Therefore, the tubing has to be fitted with stoppers. We use rollers of very large diameter -- this leads to the elimination of such strains and prevents tubing motion. A larger portion of tubing is compressed with better pressure distribution. The elasticity of the tubing is protected.\n\n\u2022 Instead of rollers we use special plastic ball bearings with glass beads. The gliding of such rollers requires only a minimal force and the corrosion resistance in the case of a spill is excellent. (http://www.peristaltic-pumps.eu)\n\n\nWas macht die Schlauchpumpe von LAMBDA so effizient?\n\n\u2022 Rollen mit kleinem Durchmesser setzen den Schlauch einer hohen Belastung aus und dr\u00fccken ihn in Rotationsrichtung. Deshalb werden die Schl\u00e4uche mit Schlauchklemmen oder Stopper fixiert. Wir hingegen benutzen Rollen mit sehr grossem Durchmesser-- damit wird die hohe Beanspruchung des Schlauchs eliminiert und der Schlauch bewegt sich nicht in die F\u00f6rderrichtung. Ein gr\u00f6sserer Schlauchabschnitt wird mit besserer Druckverteilung abgedichtet. Die Elastizit\u00e4t des Schlauchs bleibt erhalten.\n\n\u2022 Anstelle herk\u00f6mmlicher Rollen benutzen wir spezialgefertigte Plastikkugellager mit Glask\u00fcgelchen. Das Gleiten dieser korrosionsbest\u00e4ndigen Rollen ben\u00f6tigt nur eine minimale Kraft. (http://www.peristaltic-pumps.eu/schlauchpumpen.html)\n\n\nPourquoi les pompes p\u00e9ristaltiques LAMBDA sont-elles aussi efficaces?\n\n\u2022 G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les pompes p\u00e9ristaltiques sont pourvues de galets de faible diam\u00e8tre qui appliquent d'importantes contraintes sur les tuyaux et les poussent en direction du sens de rotation de la t\u00eate de la pompe. Pour \u00e9viter un tel d\u00e9placement, les tuyaux sont souvent retenus par des brides. Nous utilisons des galets de large diam\u00e8tre qui \u00e9liminent ces contraintes et n'entrainent pas de d\u00e9placement des tuyaux. Le tuyau est comprim\u00e9 sur une zone plus large permettant une meilleure distribution de la pression. L'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 des tuyaux est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e.\n\n\u2022 Au lieu de galets traditionnels, des roulements \u00e0 billes sp\u00e9ciaux de grand diam\u00e8tre en plastique avec des billes de verre sont utilis\u00e9s. Ces roulements glissent sur le tuyau requ\u00e9rant d'une force minimale. De plus, la r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 la corrosion en cas de fuites est excellente. (http://www.peristaltic-pumps.eu/pompes-peristaltiques.html)\n\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 son tan eficientes bombas perist\u00e1lticas LAMBDA?\n\n\u2022 En las bombas perist\u00e1lticas convencionales, rodillos de peque\u00f1o di\u00e1metro ejercen presi\u00f3n sobre la manguera empuj\u00e1ndola en la direcci\u00f3n de rotaci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto, se hace necesaria la utilizaci\u00f3n de abrazaderas, para sujetar la manguera y evitar que se muevan. Nosotros, en cambio, utilizamos rodillos de mayor di\u00e1metro, esto elimina dicha presi\u00f3n, garantizando as\u00ed la inmovilizaci\u00f3n de la manguera. La parte m\u00e1s larga del tubo es comprimida con una mejor distribuci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n, lo que ayuda a mantener la elasticidad de la manguera. \n\n\u2022 A diferencia de otras bombas en el mercado, las bombas perist\u00e1lticas LAMBDA utiliza cojinetes pl\u00e1sticos con bolitas de vidrio, en lugar de peque\u00f1os rodillos. Estos cojinetes pl\u00e1sticos eliminan el riesgo de corrosi\u00f3n en caso de derramamiento de l\u00edquido y reducen la pulsaci\u00f3n, fricci\u00f3n y tensi\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica en la manguera, produciendo una mejor eficiencia.

Instead of the camera being in right hand, it is in the left hand instead.  The footage was flipped in post by accident, and I did not realize it after the fact.  The footage is on a 2D card in 3D space, and in 3D space where looking up at the 2D footage from behind, so there fore it appears reversed. (Make sense)?

This was not done by any large company or a VFX team, but merely just by myself as a hobby. This was the most challenging project I have ever undertaken, consisting of 3D tracking, seamless camera cuts and 3D camera projection.  ENJOY! The Visual Effects.\n \nBreakdowns will follow so watch for that.\n\nFor those of you that think the gun is a physical prop you can buy, well.....sorry to break the news to you, but it's entirely CG.

With traditional tire chains, installation difficulties, poor ride quality, and potential damage to the wheels and tires made them impractical. Other options such as cables shared those problems. Snow tires are expensive and not suitable for driving after winter.\n\nNow there is a new solution. These textile tire chains, or tire socks, offer a solution that does no damage to wheels or tires and are easy to install. The technology lies in removing excess water between your tires and snow and increasing the contact surface. Because some states will not allow traditional chains within certain months, be prepared with these ISSE Snow Socks.  Easily machine washable to remove soiling from use.\n\nDoes no damage to pavement or driveways. To travel safely, it is recommended not to drive over 30 mph with snow chains. This is a constant factor between all traditional types of snow chains and the ISSE Snow Socks.\n\n*Please confirm tire size before ordering\n\nThis tutorial is provided as a courtesy by ECS Tuning.\n\nProper service and repair procedures are vital to the safe, reliable operation of all motor vehicles as well as the personal safety of those performing the repairs.

Once the retaining clip slides to the side, the plug (center of the lock the key fits into) launches out of the lock when hit by the hammer again.  Not the best design.\n\nThe product is not useless, and a minor fix could prevent the problem. Still not a fan of the SmartKey locks in any format. \n\nWould think the engineers at Kwikset had to have realized the vulnerability, and probably had suggested fixes. A simple drop of adhesive would cure this problem. It concerns me that the lock was brought to market with the current problem. \n\nMade the video mainly because it shocked me that so obvious a flaw was not addressed. Had the lock open about ten seconds before I saw how it probably came apart. Used a pick (scratch awl) to move it over, and could not believe how easily the retainer moved.\n\nThis is a new product on the market, and knew that if the vulnerability was not made blatantly clear, that the lock would achieve deep market penetration with the manufacturer not making any changes due to bean counters. Then, when the vulnerability was brought to light, it would be far too costly to repair units already in service.\n\nBy trumpeting the vulnerability while the product was quite new on the market, Kwikset would be forced to address the issue in order to maintain marketability of the product. Won't go into my security concerns over the SmartKey format itself - people in the lock community would already be aware if those. \n\nIt would be great if Kwikset were to correct this vulnerability, be it by adhesive, reshaping the retainer clip to make it fit tighter, or by some other means. Then they would have a product on par with their other SmartKey products. This would please a great many homeowners, as they could have gate and shed locks keyed the same as their home, and just as fast/easy to rekey. But am familiar with how a number of corporations (no fingers being pointed here) will try to sweep a problem under the table, rather than fix the problem and end up with a better product.\n\nGWiens2001\n\nUPDATE:  Kwikset has reached out and addressed the risk in this lock.  They have now made a change to the lock, and are sending me a sample to test, and having production facilities start the modified lock.  \n\nAm quite pleased that they quickly addressed the vulnerability rather than making excuses.  They showed that they do want to improve their product.  Choosing not to list exactly what they have done to make the repair (Yes, am aware of what the change is), but it sounds like a proper fix for the issue.  \n\nThere were no legal threats or offers made.  They simply did the right thing, and worked out a fix.  This is different from the recent responses from some other lock companies to issues with their locks, and elevates my opinion of the Kwikset corporate mindset.\n\nGordon\n\nQuite a bit late on adding this - been busy as heck of late.  Wanted to say that I received several 'updated' Kwikset SmartKey padlocks to test and evaluate if the 'fix' took care of the concern.  Glad to say that the concern is definitely resolved.\n\nThe modification prevents the clip from sliding to the side, thus preventing the lock core from being removed as demonstrated in the above video.  \n\nTo be honest, I abused the living daylights out of two of them, trying my best to recreate the results above.  Those 'tests' I used include not just hitting the lock with a hammer, but using a pneumatic impact hammer in an attempt to 'prove' the lock was not fixed.  By darn, it held up!\n\nNice job addressing the issue, and repairing it, Spectrum Brands (parent company of Kwikset) and Kwikset!  The lock can even still be serviced, though with a bit more effort.\n\nGordon", "title": "Kwikset SmartKey Padlock - Not Very Smart - but since this video, they fixed it!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T00:01:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ast084hyooA", "description": "\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 : \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0644\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0639 ( \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u0633\u0649 \u062a\u0633\u062c\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0644\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631 )\n\u0644\u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b ( \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0639 ) \u0648\u0642\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629\n\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0623: \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0635\u0628\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b", "title": "\u0627\u0633\u0631\u0639 \u062d\u0644 \u0644\u0623\u064a \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0632\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0629 !!.A Quick Solution for Any Marital Problem", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T15:06:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AstXCFNKmbk", "description": "Lee Hyun-do - Harangue, \uc774\ud604\ub3c4 - \uc0ac\uc790\ud6c4, MBC Top Music(\uc778\uae30\uac00\uc694 \ubca0\uc2a4\ud2b850), 67\ud68c, EP67, 1996/11/09, MBC TV, Republic of Korea", "title": "Lee Hyun-do - Harangue, \uc774\ud604\ub3c4 - \uc0ac\uc790\ud6c4, MBC Top Music 19961109", "publishedDate": "2012-06-19T04:36:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AsuEJYiteeg", "description": "", "title": "armhole and front neckline measurement", "publishedDate": "2011-01-21T09:50:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "AsuS-Fjrohs", "description": "My horse, Thor, does a horsey smile when I feed him an apple.", "title": "Thor smiles when I give him treats.", "publishedDate": "2008-10-09T22:49:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "AsuYhZq_1m0", "description": "Bibiliography\n\n\"Oil Industry Has Brought Poverty and Pollution to Niger Delta.\" Amnesty International.  http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/oil-industry-has-brought-poverty-and-pollution-to-niger-delta-20090630\n\nOkwoche, Peter. \"Nigeria Ogoniland Oil Clean-up 'could Take 30 Years'\" BBC News. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14398659\n\n\"Nigeria: The Cost of Oil.\" The Atlantic. http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/06/nigeria-the-cost-of-oil/100082/\n\nMiller, Barbara.

Welcome to VaporNation. I'm your host, as always, the Vapor MC, with your vaporizer education. Today, we're going to get to know the Magic Flight Launch Box portable vaporizer.\n\nWhen you open up the package, you want to make sure you've got the following contents: Two batteries, the battery charger, the glass drawstem, a cleaning brush, the Magic Flight herb grinder, as well as the Magic Flight Launch Box unit itself.\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to grind up your herbs with the special Magic Flight herb grinder. It fits right on top of the Magic Flight Launch Box like so. You grind it up, and the herbs fall right into the trench. Now that you've loaded up the Magic Flight, we're gonna close the lid, grab the glass drawstem, and insert it into the front of the unit. Then we're going to grab a battery. Remove the rubber pasty from the nipple -- you can put it on the other side of the battery -- and then you're going to insert it into the Magic Flight, nipple end first.\n\nIt's important to remember that as you push the battery in and as you inhale, you want to keep the Magic Flight level, that way you keep the herbs stay evenly distributed across the bottom of the chamber. So here we go: We're going to push the battery in, the light comes on, after about 5 seconds it fills with vapor, and then you rip it. That's the kind of cloud you want to see!\n\nWhat's awesome about the Magic Flight Launch Box, is that it gives you the option of the glass drawstem, or you can hit it \"native style\", which is straight through the draw hole. Now when you're finished, you can clean your Magic Flight with the attached brush here. Just sweep it out, lightly and gently, because the screen can't be replaced.\n\nThat's it! The Magic Flight Launch Box portable vaporizer.

The fish you eat may be poisoned because of this.\nThat's why we should immediately BAN using plastic micro beads inside these products! I hereby urgently ask all Consumers worldwide to BOYCOTT products containing plastic ingredients and to SIGN this petition.\"Captain Charles Moore\nPlastic Soup Foundation\n\"In 2011 North Sea foundation started a study in the Netherlands of personal care products containing plastic particles (micro beads). It was assumed the micro beads were only used in scrubs and peelings. However, the micro beads were used in much broader spectrum. Shampoo, lip-gloss, toothpaste, ... the list became longer and longer.\nA laboratory study showed the amount of plastic used in products was very high (up to 10%, a coffee filter full of plastic) and sometimes very small (50 micro meter, these particles passed through a coffee filter).\nDifferent studies show the micro beads can enter the marine environment and enter the 'Plastic Soup'. Reason enough to take action. Together with the Plastic Soup Foundation we want a ban on micro beads in personal care products and we call other organisations and people to join us.\"\n\nJeroen Dagevos\nNorth Sea Foundation\n\n \n\nBEAT THE MICRO BEAD\n\nThe UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme classified the Plastic Soup as one of the three most urgent environmental issues. Plastic Soup is the collective name for the serious problems in the sea, caused by plastic.\n\nAll plastic is made by people. And it is made so well, that it does not biodegrade. As long as we use plastic, there will always be plastic finding its way to the sea via rivers, canals and harbors.\n\nThere is hardly a solution for the problem called Plastic Soup. Because we use so much plastic, the problem will only get worse. Eventually plastic falls apart in even smaller particles under the influence of sunlight and waves, but it never decays or digests. The smaller the pieces of plastic, the more difficult it gets to retrieve them from the sea. Plastic will stay hundreds to thousands of years. It will not perish along a natural road.\n\nScientist are increasingly worried about these small pieces of plastics (micro plastics) that are sometimes so small that you can't see them with the naked eye.\n\nWithout knowing it, most of us contribute daily to the Plastic Soup by scrubbing our body, brushing our teeth, cleaning our face or washing our hair, because the plastic micro beads inside these products will be washed down the drain.

Nutella contains 21 g sugar, 12 g fats per serving (serving size of 37 g).\n\nMy Chocolate Hazelnut spread: 7 g sugar, 12 g fat (serving size 37 g). The first 2 ingredients of my recipe are the hazelnuts and chocolate. They are full of protein, fiber, and antioxidants. Not all fats are not equal. The fats from my chocolate spread are mostly monosaturated fats from the hazelnuts and the chocolate (oelic acid) crucial for brain function and normal metabolism. \n\nMany phenolic compounds (antioxidants) found in hazelnut skin are not present in the flesh; I do not recommend removing the hazelnut skin. I like my nuts raw because when you toast them, the skin gets flaky and burns. However, if you prefer toasting them, you may place them in the toaster oven for 5-6 minutes at 350\u00b0 F (177\u00b0 C). Then massage them and roll them between your hands to loosen and remove the burned skin when they are no longer hot.\n\nGrind the nuts finely in a food processor. Break the chocolate bar into small pieces. Boil the water and sweetened condensed milk in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and melt the chocolate in it for about 5 minutes until it is smooth. Turn off the heat. Add the ground hazelnuts and vanilla and mix well. Store it in a well-sealed glass container in the refrigerator and consume within two weeks. It is excellent for fruit dip. If you prefer a sweeter spread, you may want to pair with strawberry preserves or honey.\n\nHazelnuts hold a significant place among dried nuts in terms of nutrition and health because of the special composition of good fats (primarily oleic acid), protein, vitamin E, minerals, folate, dietary fiber, and powerful antioxidants.\n\nMy recipe makes 2 standard jars of commercial Nutella 792 g (26 oz)", "title": "Chocolate Hazelnut Spread - Homemade Nutella, Healthy Gourmet Recipe - www.ahbonbon.com", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T19:42:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtYhi4JtCgw", "description": "Donetsk & Makeevka are practically merged into a conurbation.\nUS.

In this episode of A State of Sight, Isaac Porter, MD explains the differences between these two eye problems.\n\nCorneal hydrops results from a break in the inner layer of the cornea in patients with keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and keratoglobus (which are all forms of corneal ectasia).  This inner layer break allows fluid to enter the cornea causing edema and clouding.  With time, this break it naturally repaired by the cornea and the swelling decreases, but a scar may be left behind.\n\nBullous keratopathy usually is the result of one or more eye operations that prematurely age the inner layer (endothelium) of the cornea.  The endothelium is responsible for pumping fluid out from the cornea to keep it thin and clear, and when it is not working properly, swelling can result.  This generally worsens over time and can require a corneal transplant to restore clarity.\n\nAny questions about corneal hydrops or bullous keratopathy?

A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called topographic prominence or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the \"parent peak\"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with 300 m (980 ft) prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7--8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m (1,640 ft) prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, like the Eiger or Nuptse. A few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in this list.\n\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). .\n\nI,Kalyani Das hereby declare that all information regarding this video I collect from www.wikipedia.org and all Images use to make this video is from Google Search www.google.com .

After learning his first instrument at the age of 16, he became obsessed with broadening his knowledge and skills, having learned how to play guitar, e-bass, piano and taking classical vocal education, as well as learning composition in nearly every genre, ranging from classical music over blues, hard rock and metal to most recently all different kinds of electronic music. \n\nHe didn't miss one day of teaching himself in every aspect of acoustics, sound design, arrangement and the like, even if that meant that other responsibilities would fall short. \n\nHe claims that it is the single most important thing to him in life, not only because it is his true passion, but also as it is the one and only kind of medicine that has ever helped him to deal with his health issues, those being a case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Tourette's Syndrome. As soon as a new idea pops into his head, nothing can disturb him or compromise his desire and dedication to put those very ideas into practice. And that's good medicine.\n\n----------\nFollow SectionZ: \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/SectionZ.Records\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/SZMusic\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/sectionz-records", "title": "Fresh Friday - Stefan Nixdorf - Back Talk [Free Download]", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T03:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtgS3Dm7FSE", "description": "TAVASTIA 1974.", "title": "HURRIGANES - Hey Groupie", "publishedDate": "2014-06-13T18:04:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AthKgX_UIso", "description": "Papoose - Alphabetic slaughter", "title": "Papoose - Alphabetic slaughter", "publishedDate": "2006-03-28T14:59:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AthiwvFcwKc", "description": "Link za izradu: http://goo.gl/ReOX84", "title": "WiFi Yagi Antena 15dB - Free", "publishedDate": "2014-06-05T20:37:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "AthjXIkdo1w", "description": "", "title": "HELEN TRAUBEL SINGS -O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL-1944 RADIO SHOW", "publishedDate": "2013-07-28T15:31:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtiC8hl-IBA", "description": "White BMW 5 Series with 22\" Vertini Magic Wheels.

One minor incident happened when a car was rear-ended, but the Skynet Google cars have yet to incur any points on their virtual licenses. Earlier this week, ABC News got the chance to go for a spin in one of the tech company's automated cars, riding shotgun in a computer-controlled Toyota Prius.\n\nThe engineers from Google explain that the Prius utilizes a series of cameras and a roof-mounted, spinning laser to see what is going on around it. The result is a vehicle which might just be safer than one with a human behind the wheel. However, according to the report, the goal of the system is not to completely remove the driver from the equation, the system is pitched as more of a \"super cruise-control\" than a full auto-drive system. The theory is that it would be useful for traffic-filled commutes to and from work, and it might be a nice solution to eliminate or reduce distracted-driving. Get a phone call? Hit the Google button and let the car have the wheel while you take your call.\n\nBecky Worley, the news correspondent in the video clip, even gets up the guts to give the Google car a real-life brake test. She steps in front of it as it's motoring down the road. What happens? The car \"sees\" her and slams on the binders. Check it all out in the video after the jump.\n\n[Source: ABC News]", "title": "ABC News gets taken for a spin in Google's self-driving Toyota Prius", "publishedDate": "2010-10-14T20:59:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtmnZJJtsgg", "description": "http://www.codedimensions.com/mainsite/audio-technologies/\nThe Jewel of the Mind\n936hz Pineal Gland Actvating Audio Soundscape Meditations", "title": "936hz Solfeggio with Soundscape", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T22:13:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtmuPWj1Zuw", "description": "[..]", "title": "Mc.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Suvarnabhumi Airport (or also called New Bangkok International Airport) is located in the Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province.\nThe province was created during the Ayutthaya period, with its administrative centre located at Phra Pradaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats and town-walls. King Rama II starting the building of the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had disbanded the town fortification. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya river, and on an island in the river the pagoda Phra Samut Chedi was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese War with  the French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.\nIn Thai the word Samut is from Sanskrit, samudra, meaning ocean or sea, and the word Prakan is from Sanskrit, pr\u0101k\u0101ra, meaning fortress, walls or stronghold.\nThe provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province. Provincial tree is Thespesia populnea. The provincial slogan is Marine Battle Fortresses, Chedi in the Water, Crocodile Farm, Exquisite Ancient City, Phra Pradaeng Songkran Festival, Tasty Dried Snakeskin Gourami, Rap Bua Festival, Industrial Estate.\nSamut Prakan is located at the mouth of the Chao Phraya river to the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called Pak Nam  the Thai word for the mouth of a river. The part of the province located on the western side of the river consist mostly of rice and prawn fields as well as mangrove forests, while the east part is the urban centre - including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis, the urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The province has a coastline of about 47.2 kilometres. Bang Pu Nature Reserve, about 12 km east of the town centre, has a large bird population. Especially during the winter the Sakdi pier at Bang Pu is very popular for Thai people feeding the wintering seagulls. The park is run jointly by the Royal Thai Army and the Thai WWF, and was officially established at the 72nd birthday of Queen Sirikit in 2004.", "title": "Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Samut Prakan Province, Thailand  ( 12 )", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T05:09:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtrIMU0xT-I", "description": "Stamatis Spanoudakis - Despina (\u0394\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1)\nFrom the CD \"\u03a7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\" (Rejoice my sea)\n\nComposed, arranged, produced & conducted by Stamatis Spanoudakis\nLyrics: Stamatis Spanoudakis\n(Rehearsal at Herodion 2013)\n\nP&C Stamatis Spanoudakis\n\n\u25b6 Available on cdbaby\n\u25b6 Available on iTunes\n\u25b6 Available on Google Play\n\u25b6 Available on Amazon\n\u25b6 Listen on Spotify\n\u25b6 WebSite: http://www.stamatisspanoudakis.com", "title": "Stamatis Spanoudakis - Despina (\u0394\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-20T17:59:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "AtrP38qGv3A", "description": "The rose chafer is one of my favorite beetles.

Risks to both mother and baby must be carefully weighed in every decision a surgeon makes. Recently, at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, a surgeon performed a groundbreaking robotic laparoscopic procedure on a 35-year-old pregnant patient whose cervix was too short to sustain a pregnancy.\n\nDr. Sami Kilic, chief of minimally invasive gynecology and research at UTMB, is the first surgeon in the world reported to have used robotically assisted, ultrasound-guided laparoscopic surgery to successfully tighten a pregnant patient's incompetent cervix. The procedure is explained in a new paper now online in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. When performed traditionally, abdominal cerclage surgery requires a large incision and a long period of recovery. Kilic's new procedure left the patient with only three tiny abdominal scars.\n\nStitches to the cervix during surgery must be precise; a suture placed a hair's breadth the wrong way can puncture either the amniotic sac or a major blood vessel in the mother. With the dual visualization screen of the da Vinci Si robotic surgical system, Kilic was able to view a real-time ultrasound image on one screen and the operative field via scope camera on another screen, side by side, at the same time he performed the surgery. This two-screen system offers unsurpassed visualization in a laparoscopic surgical situation.\n\nThe surgery lasted two hours, and the patient was discharged after a one-night stay in the hospital. An ultrasound performed two weeks later confirmed the cerclage had been placed properly. The patient proceeded to have an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, going into labor at 36 weeks. Other authors of the paper include UTMB Drs. Teresa M. Walsh, Mostafa A. Borahay and Karin A.

Anglers will notice hundreds of dead fish along the rocky shore line in the Ladders Section of Strawberry.\n\n\"As long as we have really hot temperatures, 90's and 100's, it's going to be more of a pronounced effect,\" Ward said. \"We're going to see more of it happen.\" \n \nHowever, the fish that have died aren't the type of fish that people typically like to catch. Mot of the dead fish are sucker fish that came to the Strawberry Reservoir channel to spawn. The sucker fish died when they got caught in low water conditions.\n\n\"Most of the fish people are concerned with and want to come up here and catch out there on the reservoir,\" Ward said. \"We're still doing well.\"\n\nWard has worked at Strawberry Reservoir for the past 13 years, and he said this year has had one of the lowest water levels he has ever seen.\n\n\"We just don't have much runoff left this year,\" he said. \"We didn't have a good snowpack last year.\"\n\nStrawberry Reservoir is currently about 79 percent full which isn't nearly as low as other reservoirs, but it was completely full in 2011.\n\n\"2011 was a great year,\" Ward said. \"We topped Strawberry off that year. We had a really good runoff, and so 2011 was a great year. But the last two years, we've been pretty strong into this drought cycle where we're well below average.\"\n\nWard said that as the water levels continue to decrease, the problems will the fish and other wildlife will increase. \n\n\n\nThe CELESTIAL Convergence | http://thecelestialconvergence.blogspot.com/\n\nThe CELESTIAL Convergence is a online news magazine featuring Alien Disclosure, the ET/UFO Phenomena, Earth Changes, the Paranormal, and Geological Upheavals.\n\nThis is a journey of truth, and the highlighting of clear patterns of cause and effect in the electromagnetic celestial convergence of our solar system with the Sirius star system, and the manifested transmutation with the Galactic Core of our Central Sun, Alcyone - Hunab Ku. \n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: These pages/video may contain copyrighted (\u00a9 ) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

That the composer had the same name as at least three other men from the area around Li\u00e8ge has created much confusion about the biography of the composer. A Johannes Ciconia, probably the composer's father, was probably born around 1335, and worked in Avignon in 1350 as a clerk for the wife of the nephew of Pope Clement VI.\n\nA second person by the name of Johannes Ciconia appears in records in Li\u00e8ge in 1385 as a duodenus, generally a person of young age; thus contemporary scholars are in agreement that this is the composer himself. Papal records suggest that this Ciconia was in the service of Pope Boniface IX in Rome in 1391. His whereabouts between the early 1390s and 1401 are unknown. From this time until his death in 1412, he remained connected to the cathedral of Padua. It is unclear whether he arrived in Padua earlier than 1401. If his lament, Con lagrime bagnadome, described in one text source as written for the death of Francesco of Carrara, were written for Francesco il Nuovo, then it would date from after 1406; if, as earlier scholars had assumed, it were written for the death of Francesco il Vecchio, then he would have needed to be in Padua by 1393. The possibility of an intermediate stay in Pavia has also been suggested by N\u00e1das and Ziino, as a necessary place for him to pick up Visconti associations and to learned the ars subtilior style and compositions of Philipoctus de Caserta quoted in his Sus un fontayne.\n\nCiconia's music has evidenced a comparable commingling of styles. Music typical of northern Italy, such as his madrigal Una panthera, is combined with the French ars nova. The more complex ars subtilior style surfaces in one work noted above, and the late Medieval style begins to morph into writing which points towards the melodic patterning of the Renaissance, for instance in his setting of O rosa bella. He wrote music both secular (French virelais, Italian ballate and madrigals) and sacred (motets, mass movements, some of them isorhythmic). He is also the author of two treatises on music, the Nova Musica, and De Proportionibus (which is an extract and expansion of some ideas from Nova Musica). His music-theoretical ideas stem from the more conservative Marchettian tradition, and can be contrasted with those of his Paduan contemporary Prosdocimus de Beldemandis.\n\nThough contrafacts and later sources of his compositions suggest that he was well-known in Florence, his music is scarcely represented in the large Florentine sources; for instance there is no section for his works in the Squarcialupi Codex.", "title": "Johannes Ciconia - French Ballads (3/3) Aler m'en veus", "publishedDate": "2010-01-17T16:24:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "Au4dgQS5N2U", "description": "Workwear Leicester Melton Mowbray.

If you look at these lesions very closely and very carefully, you will notice that there is a central depression. Some have even described them as looking like very tiny doughnuts. Generally speaking, these lesions will increase in number over time. Rarely, some lesions have been reported to resolve on their own, but the vast majority tends to remain permanently. These represent an overgrowth of the sebaceous glands (oil producing glands) on the face. Their growth is associated with exposure to different androgen hormones and sun. This explains why sebaceous hyperplasia is seen more commonly in men than in women, but it is still seen in all people.\n\nSebaceous gland hyperplasia is a harmless condition that is only a cosmetic concern. It does not represent anything bad, such as skin cancer. Some of the lesions, if extremely large in size and odd looking, may be evaluated for additional sebaceous gland disorders.\n\nSebaceous gland hyperplasia can effectively be treated with a number of cosmetic procedures including minor surgery, electrosurgery liquid nitrogen freezing, and, most effectively, with laser therapy.

First thing you want to do is take your fabric and the measurements that you've decided you want your blanket to be, and cut your fabric to that size. Our blanket is going to be 60 inches by 45 inches. We're working with 60 inch wide fabric, so we really only need to cut down the 45 inches.\n\nAll we're going to do is lay out our fabric. Right now it's folded in half which just makes it easier to work with. We're going to take a tape measure and measure approximately 45 inches. To do that you're just going to lay your tape measure down. If you have a really big table this will be really easy to do because you can just go ahead and lay your tape measure down across the whole thing. But, since we're working with a little bit of a shorter table we're just going to lay the tape measure down and kind of roll it up so we can get our 45 inches. There it is right there 45 inches. \n\nWe're going to straighten our fabric out a little bit, and just kind of eyeball and cut at that point. After we cut both of our pieces about the same size we're going to go ahead and lie them on top of each other and cut them more precisely. So, don't worry if your pieces right now are a little bit off. Make sure you're working with some good scissors. \n\nAs you're cutting your blanket you will notice that your fabric is not fraying. That's because fleece is a knit fabric that won't fray like woven fabrics will where the threads are actually interlocked with each other. That's why fleece, besides being so snuggly, is a great fabric to use to make your tie blanket.\n\nAnother really easy way to cut your fabric is to use a rotary cutter. We'll go ahead and do that for our second piece. You'll go ahead and take your second piece of fabric if we're doing the double lined blanket. Because this is so wide it'll be easier to work with if we fold it in half again on the width. When you buy it from the fabric store it'll come folded in half off of the bolt. All you'll want to do is fold it in half again. Then you will go ahead and take your tape measure and measure out the 45 inches. We'll see, find that 45 inch mark which is right about here. \n\nRemember, we're not being too exact with it because we're going to trim both the pieces down to size once we're ready. You'll take your, this is an acrylic ruler, kind of lay it down around the 45 inch mark. Make sure you remove the tape measure out of the way so you don't cut through it. A rotary cutter is just kind of like a little pizza cutter but it's for cutting fabric. You'll hold your acrylic ruler down with one hand and then you'll take your rotary cutter and use the acrylic ruler as a guide to make a straight line. So you'll go ahead and start from one end, push down, rule all the way across.\n\nAnd that is a super easy way to cut your fabric.", "title": "How to Cut Fabric for Fleece Blanket | No-Sew Crafts", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T10:22:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AuXYjE9Jbyk", "description": "there're 5 different ways to make forms in Revit.\nLet's learn about Extrusion\nEnjoy ;-)", "title": "Revit Family Basic Tutorial #1  - Extrusion", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T07:47:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AuXZGeWq0wQ", "description": "At the University of Ottawa, New Media course, Fall 2010.", "title": "Dr. Strangelove Lecturing on Evil Bert", "publishedDate": "2010-09-21T15:55:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AuXxw4fyttU", "description": "Hey Friendly friends!\n\nThis is my \"LOVE\" month inspired outfit.

Creatine is a fuel source; creatine is found in many foods that we eat already, which also don't stunt your growth. \nCreatine is stored as a fuel type when you run out of anaerobic fuel, so basically when you run out of ATP your body can use creatine phosphates as an energy source for anaerobic exercises like lifting weights. It has nothing to do with growth, it won't inhibit growth, and it won't cause problems. So that's all there is to it, creatine won't stunt your growth.\n\nAs a bonus protein won't stunt your growth, lifting weights won't stunt your growth, carbohydrates won't stunt your growth, sugar probably won't stunt your growth, the only thing that will really stunt your growth is a general poor nutrition strategy during your growing ages. Not enough protein, not enough carbohydrates, not enough calories, all this stuff, vitamins and minerals, while you are growing. So that's why in impoverished countries where people do not have food or enough food or are not eating correctly, those people can stunt their growth. \n\nAlso, lifting weights won't stunt your growth which you can look at my other video, but people talk about growth plates and you are going to damage your growth plates. Well growth plates are found in your long bones and lifting weights is not going to, and has never been found to, you will not find studies where lifting weights has caused people not to grow or has stopped people from growing. \n\nPeople break, basically in your long bones there is something called the epiphysis and technically you could break it, but even if you do break it doctors will put them back together and your genetics will continue to grow. Even if you break your arm, I mean you have seen kids break their arm and their arm just doesn't just stop growing and the rest of their body grows. \n\nSo I mean all of these things are, what I believe, people are just scared. People were scared when creatine came out, people were scared when protein came out, people were scared when people started lifting weights, and these are just artifacts of people's fears. They are not going to hurt you; you won't find real scientific studies that say it. You will find some doctors or scientists that say be on the safe side, but they are just scared of being an ambassador, they are scared of being doctors that people say doesn't know their facts. Because popular opinion will say you shouldn't lift or lifting can stunt your growth. \n\nWhat I am saying is that is just wrong, Arnold Schwarzenegger and all these other guys, they lifted weights and they actually grew taller. There are some studies that show that lifting weights can put that type of stress on your body that makes you grow taller. So the contrary might be true.\n\nSo here is what it comes down to, unless you have actual facts about why it would stunt your growth you are just making your decision based on fear or being cautious. And there is nothing wrong with that, you just have to recognize that that is what it is. There is nothing wrong with being cautious, if you want to take the cautious path and that's fine, but there is no data, or scientific data, that I have seen and I have looked for it. There may even be data that it helps you. Hope that helps, if you disagree with me, let's talk about it.

Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, is omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Colours were more expressive rather than natural: red skin implied hard working tanned youth, whereas yellow skin was used for women or middle-aged men who worked indoors; blue or gold indicated divinity because of its unnatural appearance and association with precious materials; the use of black for royal figures expressed the fertility of the Nile from which Egypt was born. Stereotypes were employed to indicate the geographical origins of foreigners[1]The monumental sculpture of Ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 \"fists\" to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead.[4] This appears as early as the Narmer Palette from Dynasty I, but there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses.[5] Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE,[6] and with the exception of the art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten,[7] and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.[8]\nPottery\nNew Kingdom pottery c.1400 BC\n\nAncient Egyptians used steatite (some varieties were called soapstone) and carved small pieces of vases, amulets, images of deities, of animals and several other objects. Ancient Egyptian artists also discovered the art of covering pottery with enamel. Covering by enamel was also applied to some stone works.\n\nDifferent types of pottery items were deposited in tombs of the dead. Some such pottery items represented interior parts of the body, like the lungs, the liver and smaller intestines, which were removed before embalming. A large number of smaller objects in enamel pottery were also deposited with the dead. It was customary to craft on the walls of the tombs cones of pottery, about six to ten inches tall, on which were engraved or impressed legends relating to the dead occupants of the tombs. These cones usually contained the names of the deceased, their titles, offices which they held, and some expressions appropriate to funeral purposes.\nPapyrus\nThe Book of the Dead written on papyrus\n\nPapyrus was used by ancient Egyptians (and exported to much of the ancient Mediterranean world) for writing and painting. Papyrus is relatively fragile, lasting at most a century or two in a library, and though used all over the classical world has only survived when buried in the very dry conditions of Egypt, and even then is often in poor condition. Papyrus texts illustrate all dimensions of ancient Egyptian life and include literary, religious, historical and administrative documents.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_ancient_Egypt", "title": "Egyptian Handicrafts & Sculptures, Wonderful Arts!!", "publishedDate": "2013-12-29T07:22:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "AuiInsyYnRQ", "description": "if you want to watch the best funny new video please vist and like our page on facebook http://www.facebook.com/7funny", "title": "amazing mini bike", "publishedDate": "2012-08-23T20:05:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "Auj3hJEcWL0", "description": "Absolutely striking!

Marmots mostly live in mountainous areas, such as the Alps, northern Apennines, Eurasian steppes, Carpathians, Tatras, and Pyrenees in Europe and northwestern Asia; the Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, Cascades, Pacific Ranges, and Sierra Nevada in North America; and the Deosai Plateau in Pakistan and Ladakh in India. The groundhog of North America is a lowland marmot. The similarly sized, but more social, prairie dog is not classified in the genus Marmota but in the related genus Cynomys. Marmots typically live in burrows (often within rockpiles, particularly in the case of the yellow-bellied marmot), and hibernate there through the winter. Most marmots are highly social and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed. Marmots mainly eat greens and many types of grasses, berries, lichens, mosses, roots, and flowers. Marmots have been known since antiquity. Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed the story of \"gold-digging ants\" reported by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the 5th century BC, was founded on the golden Himalayan marmot of the Deosai Plateau and the habit of local tribes such as the Minaro to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows. The etymology of the term \"marmot\" is uncertain. It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning \"mountain mouse\".\nBeginning in 2010, Alaska celebrates February 2 as \"Marmot Day\", a holiday intended to observe the prevalence of marmots in that state and take the place of Groundhog Day.", "title": "Marmot, \u00cele Notre-Dame, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, North America", "publishedDate": "2011-08-12T02:13:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "AurO4lXX9AU", "description": "Style ambassador Hiroshi Fujiwara, Nike design legend Tinker Hatfield and Nike Inc.

Il a \u00e9galement forg\u00e9 le concept de libert\u00e9 religieuse. Dans les temps modernes, Martin Luther est le premier \u00e0 invoquer solennellement la libert\u00e9 de conscience devant l'Empereur Charles Quint, les souverains et les villes libres d'Allemagne, le 20 avril 1521, \u00e0 la Di\u00e8te de Worms. \u00ab Je suis li\u00e9 par les textes scripturaires que j'ai cit\u00e9s et ma conscience est captive des paroles de Dieu ; je ne puis ni ne veux me r\u00e9tracter en rien, car il n'est ni s\u00fbr ni honn\u00eate d'agir contre sa propre conscience \u00bb. La R\u00e8forme \u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts va s'appuyer sur une affirmation d\u00e9cid\u00e9e de la libert\u00e9 de conscience du chr\u00e9tien individuel. Mais assez vite elle va lui fixer des limites, voire la refuser dans certains cas. Ainsi pour Jean Calvin, la libert\u00e9 de conscience s'analyse essentiellement en une stricte ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 la parole divine. Devenu le ma\u00eetre de Gen\u00e8ve, il se consid\u00e9rera comme le seul interpr\u00e8te qualifi\u00e9 de cette parole et fera condamner par l'autorit\u00e9 civile tous les dissidents. Le 27 octobre 1553, l'ex\u00e9cution par le feu de Michel Servet marque le point de rupture avec les origines de la R\u00e9forme, le refus de la libert\u00e9 de conscience et le retour \u00e0 l'intol\u00e9rance. Son disciple et futur successeur, Th\u00e9odore de B\u00e8ze, aura m\u00eame cette phrase terrible : \u00ab La libert\u00e9 de conscience est une doctrine diabolique \u00bb. S\u00e9bastien Castellion (1515-1563), professeur \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de B\u00e2le, sera le seul \u00e0 s'\u00e9lever publiquement contre cette ex\u00e9cution, dans trois ouvrages, dont l'un sera censur\u00e9 sous la pression de Calvin et de la ville de Gen\u00e8ve et publi\u00e9 50 ans apr\u00e8s sa mort, aux Pays-Bas. Le \u00ab Trait\u00e9 des h\u00e9r\u00e9tiques \u00bb, publi\u00e9 sous un pseudonyme en 1554 est un plaidoyer pour la libert\u00e9 de conscience et la tol\u00e9rance. La brochure \u00ab Contre le libelle de Calvin \u00bb, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en 1555, est un r\u00e9quisitoire contre Calvin, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l'instigateur du meurtre de Servet, pour ses seules convictions antitrinitaires. Enfin le livre \u00ab Conseil \u00e0 la France d\u00e9sol\u00e9e \u00bb publi\u00e9 en 1562, souligne que l'Etat ne peut forcer les consciences, impute aux Catholiques comme aux Protestants la responsabilit\u00e9 de la guerre civile, les invite \u00e0 la tol\u00e9rance et les exhorte \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat des pers\u00e9cutions et des luttes religieuses. Seul Philippe Melanchthon adresse une lettre de soutien \u00e0 Castellion, l'assurant de son estime et lui t\u00e9moignant son amiti\u00e9. \nEn droit, l'expression \u00ab Libert\u00e9 de conscience \u00bb appara\u00eet pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans les \u00c9dits royaux de pacification, \u00e0 commencer par l'Edit d'Amboise en 1563. La libert\u00e9 de conscience, purement individuelle et limit\u00e9e au for int\u00e9rieur, \u00e9tait reconnue en faveur des protestants, mais distingu\u00e9e de la libert\u00e9 de culte, toujours n\u00e9goci\u00e9e, limit\u00e9e ou interdite. Ce fut l'Edit de Nantes du 13 avril 1598 qui donna pour la premi\u00e8re fois un statut juridique stable et complet aux r\u00e9form\u00e9s et \u00e0 leur Eglise. La libert\u00e9 de conscience \u00e9tait toujours reconnue aux Protestants (article VI). Ceux-ci devaient pouvoir acc\u00e9der \u00e0 toutes les fonctions, y compris les fonctions publiques (article XXVII). Des chambres \u00ab mi-parties \u00bb \u00e9taient instaur\u00e9es dans plusieurs parlements (principalement \u00e0 Bordeaux et Toulouse) pour juger les affaires entre protestants ou qui opposent des protestants \u00e0 des catholiques (articles XXX \u00e0 LXVII). La libert\u00e9 de culte n'\u00e9tait quant \u00e0 elle accord\u00e9e que de fa\u00e7on limit\u00e9e, refus\u00e9e notamment dans certaines grandes villes comme Paris, Toulouse, Reims ou Dijon (anciennes villes ligueuses). Avec la politique de Louis XIV d'application de l'Edit \u00ab \u00e0 la rigueur \u00bb, puis le retour de pers\u00e9cutions ouvertes \u00e0 partir de 1680, libert\u00e9 de conscience et libert\u00e9 de culte furent progressivement an\u00e9anties. Ainsi l'article XLV de la d\u00e9claration du Roi du 2 avril 1666, impose le bapt\u00eame catholique aux enfants de p\u00e8re catholique ou ancien catholique, m\u00eame si la m\u00e8re est protestante et prescrit qu'ils seront \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans cette religion par leurs plus proches parents catholiques. Premi\u00e8re atteinte \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de conscience. D'autres suivront, dont la d\u00e9claration du 18 juin 1681 qui autorise les enfants de la RPR (Religion Pr\u00e9tendue R\u00e9form\u00e9e) \u00e0 se convertir au catholicisme d\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge de 7 ans, sans que leurs parents puissent s'y opposer. La d\u00e9claration du 19 novembre 1680 impose de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 aux juges royaux de se rendre au chevet des malades de la RPR, pour s'assurer qu\u00b9ils ne souhaitent pas abjurer. (J.

Subscribe to our youtube channel to be updated for new videos of this course !\n\nThe course consists of 10 lessons, which will be published once per 2 weeks on the learndutch.org youtube channel between September 2014 and January 2015. The course will start on 10th of September (introduction) and 11th of September (lesson 1).\n\nThe course is made by Tom Faes (from Belgium) and Bart de Pau (from the Netherlands). \n\nThe lessons are aimed at foreigners who learn Dutch, to make them aware of the differences. Fortunately, the differences are just very small: if you learnt Dutch in one country, you will have absolutely no problem to use it in the other. It is like UK English vs US English. There is a difference in the accent and a few words.\n\nThe main goal of the course is to explain the meaning of Flemish words. It will help the Dutch learner to understand conversations with Belgians better. The course explains how something is called in the Netherlands and how it is called in Flanders.\n\nThis will help to avoid misunderstandings! \n\nAttention: for the ease of the understanding of the course we left away the nuance. Of many words, it is not true that 100% of the Dutch use one word, and 100% of the Belgians use the Flemish translation. It can be, that in the southern provinces of the Netherlands you hear the \u201cflemish\u201d word, while the Belgians could also use the \u201cdutch\u201d word. The goal of our course (to make Dutch learners understand conversations with Belgians better) does not require to make long discussions about the use of each word in which locations/frequency.\n\nNederlands:\n\nStudio Studeo is een video cursus over de verschillen in het gebruik van de Nederlandse taal tussen Nederland en het Nederlands sprekend deel van Belgi\u00eb (Vlaanderen).\n\nDe cursus bestaat uit 10 lessen.

De cursus is gemaakt door Tom Faes (uit Belgi\u00eb) and Bart de Pau (uit Nederland).\n\nDe lesson zijn gericht op buitenlanders die Nederlands leren, om hen bekend te maken met de verscihllen. Gelukkig, zijn de verschillen maar erg klein. Wie Nederlands leert in het ene land zal geen problemen ondervinden in het andere. Het is als UK Engels en VS Engels.

Het kan goed zijn dat men de Vlaamse variant ook in de zuidelijke Nederlandse provincies hoort. Even goed kan ook de \u201cNederlandse variant\u201d gewoon in Belgi\u00eb gebruikt worden.

One species of poppy, Papaver somniferum produces edible seeds, and is also the source of the crude drug opium which contains powerful medicinal alkaloids such as morphine and has been used since ancient times as analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drugs. Following the trench warfare which took place in the poppy fields of Flanders, during the 1st World War, red poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime Poppies are herbaceous annual, biennial or short-lived perennial plants. Some species are monocarpic, dying after flowering. Poppies can be over 4 feet tall with flowers up to six inches across. The flowers have 4 to 6 petals, many stamens  forming a conspicuous whorl in the centre of the flower and an ovary consisting of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any color and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the bud and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. Poppies are in full bloom late spring to early summer. Most species secrete latex when injured. The pollen of the oriental poppy, Papaver orientale, is dark blue. The opium poppy, Papaver somniferum, is mainly grown in eastern and southern Asia, and South Eastern Europe. It is believed that it originated in the Mediterranean region  The pollen of the field poppy or corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) is dark green to grey. Bees use poppies as a pollen source.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

No state in the U.S. touches more than eight states. Missouri is bounded on the north by Iowa; on the east, across the Mississippi River, by Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee; on the south by Arkansas; and on the west by Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska (the last across the Missouri River). The two largest Missouri rivers are the Mississippi, which defines the eastern boundary of the state, and the Missouri River, which flows from west to east through the state, essentially connecting the two largest metros, Kansas City and St. Louis.\nAlthough today the state is usually considered part of the Midwest,[18] \n\nMissouri Mortgage rates\nhistorically Missouri was considered by many to be a Southern state,[19] chiefly because of the settlement of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the Civil War. The counties that made up \"Little Dixie\" were those along the Missouri River in the center of the state, settled by Southern migrants who held the greatest concentration of slaves.\nIn 2005, Missouri received 16,695,000 visitors to its national parks and other recreational areas totaling 202,000 acres (820 km2), giving it $7.41 million in annual revenues, 26.6% of its operating expenditures.[20]\nTopography[edit]\n\n\nA physiographic map of Missouri.\nNorth of, and in some cases just south of, the Missouri River lie the Northern Plains that stretch into Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. Here, gentle rolling hills remain from the glaciation that once extended from the Canadian Shield to the Missouri River. Missouri has many large river bluffs along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Meramec rivers. Southern Missouri rises to the Ozark Mountains, a dissected plateau surrounding the Precambrian igneous St. Francois Mountains. This region also hosts karst topography characterized by high limestone content with the formation of sinkholes and caves.[21]", "title": "Missouri Mortgage Rates -- For Best Rates Call 1-888-414-3846", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T19:50:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "AvAETyFKlxk", "description": "This is what Prevue Guide SHOULD look like, not any C-Band or Tulsa, OK listings!
