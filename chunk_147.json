Women from across the country visit our practice in St. Louis, Missouri to get the results they need utilizing noninvasive vaginal surgery as well as the most minimally invasive surgical procedures.  Our reputation speaks for itself -- over 500 surgeries each year, many of which are women who have come to us to repair the work from previous surgery.   We prefer to educate women and be their first choice for the best solution.\n\nLabiaplasty\nThe labiaplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is normally treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery can be performed in two ways, either by reducing the excess tissue along the edges of the labia by simply trimming along the inner folds until the labia no longer protrude, or by cutting out a 'V' shaped wedge of tissue from the underneath of the labia, the edges of which are then sewn back together. This method leaves the front of the labia unchanged, making the evidence of surgery less noticeable.\nSurgeons nowadays tend to use dissolvable stitches in this area to aid healing and reduce pain and discomfort. Some surgeons also use a laser rather than a scalpel for cutting to reduce bleeding in the area, as the laser cauterises blood vessels as it cuts.\nVaginoplasty\nThe vaginoplasty operation usually takes about 1 - 2 hours, and is treated as a day case, meaning that you are discharged to go home a few hours after your surgery is completed. There may be cases where an overnight stay is required.\nThe surgery is designed to tighten the vagina and is done by joining together the stretched muscle at the back of the vagina and therefore shortening it, using dissolvable stitches, and then removing excess vaginal lining (vaginal mucosa) and tightening the surrounding soft tissues. This procedure may also be done using a laser. The resulting decrease in the size of the vaginal cavity creates more friction during sexual intercourse, often described as giving a woman back the vagina she had before she had children. The G-spot is not affected by this procedure.\nHymenoplasty\nThe hymen is a membrane that partially obstructs the vaginal opening, and is believed by most scientists to have no known anatomical function whatsoever, but is simply a remnant from the development of the foetus into a girl in the womb. There are arguments that it serves as an infection barrier to the vagina in infancy but this is simply a hypothesis", "title": "Disgusting Bodies human life urogenital system part 4", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T11:34:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8H2O4okA160", "description": "Suscr\u00edbete a ANIMALES: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkGA2ze3b9SpcqCesFYYyzw", "title": "Gib\u00f3n de mejillas doradas (Hylobates gabriellae)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T15:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8H2rjjAuojc", "description": "The Battle of two amazing winger.

Individuals with PKU cannot process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is present in most foods. Without treatment, phenylalanine builds up in the bloodstream and causes severe neurological complications, including mental retardation. To prevent damage, a strict diet very low in phenylalanine and daily consumption of special formula containing life sustaining nutrition must be started shortly after birth. \n\nManaging PKU is difficult and presents social and economic challenges. Insurance coverage is hit or miss depending on the state you live in and the insurance carrier which covers you.  We need for this to change and have equal coverage between all states so people with PKU can get the treatment they need to live normal and healthy lives.\n\nLET'S GET MOVING FOR MEDICAL FOODS: FEDERAL ADVOCACY EFFORTS\n\nBill Information\nThe Senate Bill is S.311 and was introduced by Senator John Kerry (MA).

The World Health Organization considers Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) an epidemic. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 20-30% of people with chronic Hepatitis C will eventually face life-threatening symptoms.\nIs there a cure for Hepatitis C?\nYes, there are \"cures\" for Hepatitis C. There are standard conventional medicine treatments for HCV that can \"cure\" you. For Hepatitis C, \"cure\" is also known as \"sustained viral remission\" (SVR) and that is why I put the word cure in quotes. EVERYONE SHOULD consider their options and CONSULT WITH A HEP C DOCTOR about their chances of SVR which they can predict after looking at test results for genotype, viral load, and looking at the condition of your liver.\nAccording to a recent article published in June, 2009 Hepatology, \"up to 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C fail to respond to initial therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). With unsuccessful viral eradication, these patients remain at risk for developing progression of their liver disease.\" If you are among these \"nonresponders,\" if you are someone who has low chances of Hepatitis C SVR through conventional treatment, if you are frightened of the many reported horrible side effects of Hep C conventional treatment, if you are seeking complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) to use in conjunction with interferon to improve your odds of beating Hepatitis C, or if you are simply interested in natural, holistic options, then you are in the right place! We strive to report all the natural healing options for Hepatitis C on this website but we emphasize working with a Hep Doctor is extremely important to your chances of recovery.\nI want to help you find answers to your questions about alternative treatments for hepatitis C. My goal is to give you objective information and a variety of viewpoints on alternative medicine for HCV (hepatitis C). I strive to provide consumer-oriented, unbiased, scientific information about hepatitis C and your treatment options.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to hepatitis C. But there are Hepatitis C complimentary alternative medicine (CAM) treatments and protocols that have been used successfully with a variety of results ranging from normalizing liver enzyme levels to total \"clearance\" and \"elimination\" of the hepatitis virus! Results vary. Methods of treatment for Hep C vary. It is our goal to make all this information available to you by providing well-researched reports on the methods being used. This website will present you with all of the alternative treatments to mitigate, possibly even cure hepatitis C!\nIf you or a loved one suffer from Hep C, you know you need KNOWLEDGE to fight the Hepatitis C Virus,referred to by many as the \"dragon\". If you feel this way, you have come to the right place. We provide tons of information on Hepatitis C on this site, where you can explore and search for your own answers.

In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongate body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and the anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name \"bonytongues\" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the \"tongue\", equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The fish can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into the swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue. The arowana is an \"obligatory air breather\"\n\nOsteoglossids are carnivorous, often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; it has been reported that Osteoglossum species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (almost 2 metres) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname \"water monkeys\". Arowana species typically grow to around 2 to 3 feet in captivity.\n\nSeveral species of osteoglossid exhibit extensive parental care. They build nests and protect the young after they hatch. All species are mouthbrooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.\n\nArowanas are solitary fish and only appreciate company while young; adults may show excessive dominance and aggression. Some compatible fish often partnered with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, plecostomus, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gar, tinfoil barb, siamese tigerfish (datnioides microlepis) and any other semi-aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana's mouth.\n\nThese fishes are best kept with live or frozen feed and they easily outgrow the tank within a span of 8--10 months. Always preferred in a large type aquarium of at least 150 gallons\n\nThe Asian arowana comprises several varieties of freshwater fish in the genus Scleropages. Some sources differentiate these varieties into multiple species, while others consider the different strains to belong to a single species, Scleropages formosus. They have several other common names, including Asian bonytongue, dragon fish, and a number of names specific to different varieties.\n\nNative to Southeast Asia, Asian arowanas inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and wetlands. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on insects.\n\nThese popular aquarium fish have special cultural significance in areas influenced by Chinese culture. The name dragon fish stems from their resemblance to the Chinese dragon. This popularity has had both positive and negative effects on their status as endangered species.\n\nCopyrights : MrZygy3", "title": "White Arowana Fish", "publishedDate": "2012-11-18T07:57:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HJTHceGkto", "description": "", "title": "Diether Krebs - Im Hotel (Professor Korkhobel)", "publishedDate": "2011-01-02T16:29:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HK2MdPtjkQ", "description": "Porcelain And The Tramps - Gasoline\nAKA Porcelain Black!\n\nI do not own this song or lyrics.

Mija\n2. Origins\n3. Backdraft\n4. Axis\n\nFirst Ever Four Track Pryda EP\n\nEric Prydz today unveiled his new Pryda EP. It's a classic slice of the inimitable Pryda sound that has defined the label's output over the last ten years, and united the dance community. Pryda 028 is the first Pryda release to ever contain four tracks, and comes hot on the heels of the anthemic Eric Prydz summer hit 'Liberate'.\n\nThese four tracks -- Mija, Origins, Axis, & Backdraft - show another side to Pryda, one firmly rooted in the label's club roots. Pryda 028 speaks to Prydz' love of dark rooms and late nights, dancefloors with their heads down -- audiences losing themselves in a journey, surrendering to the music, rather than demanding another recognizable drop.\n\nPryda 028 another genre defining release for Pryda -- its house music but first and foremost it's Pryda. The EP's intricate blend and layering of harmonies and hooks, replete with that distinctive Prydz touch for melody, combine to make club music that just couldn't come from anyone else.\n\nTen years and 28 releases in, Prydz and his Pryda label remain in the enviable position of straddling a line between the overground and underground, an achievement that is ever more difficult in the polarized world of contemporary electronic music.\n\nWhether it's a mainstage slot, or a dark after-hours session as his techno alias Cirez D, Prydz fans have come to expect something different and unique from the Swede. At a time when EDM festival mainstages homogenate, Prydz seems to stand further and further apart. This Pryda EP is an uncompromising exploration of the style and sound that define one of dance music's truly singular talents.\n\nLike: www.facebook.com/EricPrydzOfficial\nFollow: www.twitter.com/ericprydz\nWeb: www.ericprydz.tv", "title": "Pryda - Axis (Out Now)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-23T16:48:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HRjYbJsZGU", "description": "the GazettE - The Stupid Tiny Insect (AMV Tokyo Ghoul)", "title": "the GazettE - The Stupid Tiny Insect (AMV Tokyo Ghoul)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-19T01:55:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HS-xzR1T1c", "description": "This is an experimental film about where someones mind goes when they receive bad news.

Stem elongation will start soon, so the crops start looking a bit hungry already. As per our nutrient management recommendation, the next nitrogen application was due today. We lowered the water again for that and I put on another half bag of urea as prescribed. \n\nNancy's team was out there this morning to do their crop injury assessment. An 8.5% rat injury and over 25% whorl maggot seem to be our major problems so far. The latter is more than normal, I'd say. The general wisdom is that this kind of leaf damage during vegetative growth rarely causes significant yield losses, but I admit having doubts about that if it is that high. It seems that most of the research on whorl maggot damage was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s  when yields were usually in the 4-5 t/ha. Has anyone verified this in more recent years, at much higher yield levels? Is our knowledge on that still correct? I don't know.\n\nI also spent some time this morning wondering whether we should do anything about prophylactic stemborer control. Nancy only found 0.37% deadheart damage, but what if they still come? If we decide to apply a systemic insecticide for prophylactic protection we'd have to do it now. Information I found on that in the Rice Knowledge Bank was not really \"actionable\". The IRRI fact sheet states that \"Chemical control of stem borers is generally not recommended as stem borers are quite difficult to control with insecticides. .... Systemic insecticides, which go inside the plant, are the only reliable form of chemical control for stem borers after the borers have entered the stem, but by then it is generally too late to save the rice stem anyway. \n\nSo, what should we do? Nothing and hope for the best? If our goal was to conduct a maximum yield trial I would probably apply a systemic insecticide such as carbofuran (usually marketed as Furadan and applied in granular form into the standing water). But it is a very toxic pesticide and already banned in the some countries. The large database we have in IRRI on crop losses in rice suggests that yield losses due to stemborer are mostly in the range of 1-3%. It can be more, but that is rare. So, it's probably not worth to put Furadan on. We'll take some risk of yield loss, but it'll be small, I hope.\"\n\nLessons learned\nI find it hard to make advance decisions on pest management and there is little diagnostic guidance for that other than combining general knowledge with a bit of common sense. Counting egg masses of stemborers before they hatch, for example, would be quite tedious and perhaps also inaccurate because many natural predators eat those eggs anyway. So, I am uneasy about all that and I can understand that farmers struggle with making such decisions.", "title": "12.

So that's why we believe he deserves a strict punishment. Our board has unanimously decided to ban him from competitive cricket for the next six months, both national and international cricket. Also till December 31, 2015, he won't receive any NOCs for foreign tournaments and his current NOCs have been withdrawn.\"\n\nShakib has been involved in several disputes in the recent past. He had left for the Caribbean to play in the CPL without a valid NOC, and reportedly threatened to quit playing Tests and Twenty20 internationals when asked by Hathurusingha to return and join a training camp.

Simply email us at info@keenanwest.com\n\u00a0\nMy anti-bullying performance is 60 minutes long and combines my pop-culture inspired videos, (\u201cNever Ever\u201d Bully Prevention Music Video) music, and dance with Secret Mean Stinks\u2019\u00a0and The Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s proven anti-bullying curriculum, providing powerful and thought-provoking motivational messages that engage students and help them take ownership of bringing an end to bullying at their school and among their friends. As a recording artist, I truly want my voice to not only raise awareness of the issue of bullying, but also to highlight and celebrate the kids that have taken it on themselves and found the courage to stand up against mean behavior. Following a Secret Mean Stinks Nicest. Tour. Ever. assembly, students will not only walk away with tangible ways to combat bullying, but also a newfound sense of unity amongst their peers.\n\nThis above video is dedicated to all the kids that stand up to bullying and those who choose to make a difference in the lives of kids who are bullied.

Victims wake to find that they are paralyzed and unable to move or speak.

In extreme cases, these potentially supernatural attacks can occur for decades. Overwhelmed, exhausted, and entirely alone, victims can lead shattered lives dominated by the fear of social stigma. Those who seek medical advice are often misdiagnosed and labeled psychotic or schizophrenic.\nIn \"Your Worst Nightmare ~ Supernatural Assault\" Soul Smack explores the surprisingly common and greatly misunderstood phenomenon of sleep paralysis. In this ground breaking documentary, Soul Smack interviews actual victims, consults with experts, and offers advice on how to live with what might be your worst nightmare. \n\nSoul Smack will launch it's media rich site on 10/31/08 to coincide with the premier of it's DVD \"Your Worst Nightmare ~ Supernatural Assault.\"  In the meantime, we are offering a few temporary pages as well as a forum for feedback, insight, and discussion.

Nutritional professionals continue to be in high demand in the clinical, community, and private practice settings; as well as in the roles of Food Service/Certified Dietary Managers, Nursing Home Administrators, and Hospital Executives. The future is indeed bright, but which path is best for you?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the average U.S. worker changes careers 3-5 times during their lifetime and will have had 11 jobs before they reach the age of 42. So if you haven't already had several different jobs in nutrition, chances are that you will.\n\nThanks to the extensive academic and practical training nutritional professionals go through, you have the luxury and expertise to make a variety of jobs in dietetics viable, though some may be a better fit for you than others. You work in a growth industry that offers diverse ways to work toward the same goal of helping people get and stay healthy through nutrition.\n\nHere are some profiles of personality traits to determine which sort of career in dietetics may best suit you.\n\n1) The Planner ... You are perceptive and sensitive to how others are feeling and you enjoy bringing structure and order to your world. Your talent for organization helps you develop structured plans to help people reach their nutrition goals. \n\nIf this sounds like you, you may be a great clinical dietitian, community nutritionist, private in-person or tele-health counselor. The skills described above are also the makings for a culinary nutritionist working in an upscale restaurant.\n\n2) The Visionary ... You have a knack for taking the complex and making it simple. You enjoy being social, networking, and leading a team. While you are very social, you also need alone time to process information and develop 40,000 foot solutions. \n\nYour ideal work environment may be one that allows you freedom in your daily activities. You may make a great business owner, manager, supermarket/pharmacy dietitian, or independent consultant.\n\n3) The Artist ... You love a challenging project that takes advantage of your creativity, you have excellent communication skills, and you are good at whatever interests you or ignites your passion. Some may even describe you as an artist. You're self-reliant and independent, so although you enjoy working with others, you may prefer to work solo. You probably dislike detail-oriented work or structured work environments.\n\nThis project-oriented, independent working means that you have a lot of career options. You may enjoy being a traveling RD, juggling a dozen consulting projects, creating recipes, or perhaps writing a blog.\n4) The Entrepreneur ... You are your work. You are self-motivated, lead by example, ambitious, and you don't accept the status quo. Your passion and charisma draw in those around you, and you are often a mentor to others. You wouldn't do well in the military - you need to do things your way.\n\nYour career options are wide-open, as long as you can run the show. So regardless of what path you take, make sure you're the boss!\n\nIf no single bucket above describes you perfectly, fret not, you may find that you are a composite of qualities described in more than one category. The bottom line from the hundreds of nutrition professionals I work with every year to find their \"dream\" career, is that they work in an environment in which their professional interests, preferred working environment, and skill sets are all in alignment. So whether you are a Planner, Visionary, Artist, or Entrepreneur, find the path that gets you excited when you wake up in the morning, and your future in dietetics will continue to be bright.\n\nRyan Davis, MBA is the President of Dietitians On Demand.

Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.\n\nAlthough they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial having a narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into. Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family that the species belongs to.[1] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.[2]\n\nCrocodile size, morphology, behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.[3] Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.\nsee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile\nA crocodile\u2019s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. Its external morphology is a sign of its aquatic and predatory lifestyle. Its streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly, it also tucks its feet to the side while swimming, which makes it faster by decreasing water resistance. They have webbed feet which, though not used to propel the animal through the water, allow them to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water, where the animal sometimes moves around by walking. Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence.\n\nLike other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony, but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones.[20] Their tongues are not free, but held in place by a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.[21] Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.", "title": "Crocodile Sounds and Pictures", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T13:06:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HyiQAvx-TE", "description": "Wood propane gas hot water heater.", "title": "Wood fire hot water heater.", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T00:07:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8HyzMJfVB4c", "description": "VALENCIA CLASSICAL PILATES 2014 DAVID BELIO WORKSHOP WITH PETER FIASCA", "title": "SEMICIRCLE IN THE CADILLAC", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T10:35:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Hz0TC-F2JQ", "description": "GTA 5 Next Gen - NEW Rare Car Duke O' Death Machine Gameplay & Location GTA 5 Next Gen - GTA 5 & GTA 5 Online is Here!!

Colarusso, M.D.\nClinical Professor of Psychiatry, \nUniversity of California at San Diego\n(12/21/11)\n\nWouldn't be nice if we could just skip adolescence? You know, those terrible years from 12 to 20. I'm sure most parents are shouting YES! and many adolescents as well. Well, unfortunately, we can't magically skip over these vital years. So there is nothing left to do but make the best of a bad situation. That's what this book is about, obtaining the information to make these years, as a parent or a teenager, as easy as possible and, dare I say, very enjoyable at times. The key is knowledge and an infinite amount of patience.\n\nWith a little bit of humor, plenty of understanding and 50 years of experience treating adolescents, child psychiatrist Calvin Colarusso, M.D. provides ideas and examples to smooth the way. \n\nThink of this book as a survival tool for parents and a guide on how to manage your parents for adolescents.\n\nSurviving Adolescence, A Roadmap for Teens and Their Parents provides understanding of inscrutable adolescent behavior and practical suggestions on what to do about mood swings, backtalk, disgusting bedrooms, sexual behavior and dating. \n\nDevelopmental concepts included are:\n\u2022 An understanding of the effects of puberty\n\u2022 The meaning of adolescent withdrawal and secretiveness\n\u2022 The need for continued parental involvement and limits\n\u2022 The meaning of adolescent crushes\n\u2022 When to allow dating\n\u2022 The vital role of friendships\n\u2022 Parental involvement in choosing a career\n\u2022 Do's and Don'ts for parents\n\n\nAbout the Author: Calvin Colarusso, M.D.\nAn eminent authority in the field of development, Dr. Colarusso, M.D. is a board-certified Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, University of California at San Diego, where he served for two decades as Director of the Child Psychiatry Residency Training Program. \n\nHe is also a Training and Supervising Analyst in child and adult psychoanalysis at the San Diego Psychoanalytic Institute and an internationally known lecturer to students, professionals, and the general public on many aspects of normal and pathologic development. \n\nHis six books in print have been published in English, Korean, and Spanish. \nSee http://amzn.to/calcolarusso.", "title": "Surviving Adolescence: A Roadmap for Teens and Their Parents", "publishedDate": "2012-01-11T23:56:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "8I3qE8_ZSMY", "description": "What's special about a festival: those spur-of-the-moment collaborations between musicians -- here's one of our favorites: Kellyn Celtic Arts Irish Dance Academy joining Albannach!", "title": "Albannach with Kellyn Irish Dancers - Caloosahatchee 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-02-20T21:38:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8I3zFtxF5S8", "description": "", "title": "loti bien nga syri", "publishedDate": "2009-09-13T14:15:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8I46ecUTmaw", "description": "The Research Group for Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB) contributes with essential tools for diagnosis, follow-up and a better understanding of clinical patologies", "title": "ICT help to improve the clinical practice", "publishedDate": "2009-10-07T08:27:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8I4DzF2f204", "description": "Vegan refried beans with no MSG.", "title": "Veggie Refried Beans", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T02:05:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8I5-6nYJYaU", "description": "Bocas del Toro Panam\u00e1 Surfing - Final 1era Etapa del Circuito Nacional 2014.

They are triggered by the discharges of positive lightning between an underlying thundercloud and the ground.\n\nSprites appear as luminous reddish-orange flashes. They often occur in clusters within the altitude range 50\u201390 km (31\u201356 mi) above the Earth's surface. Sporadic visual reports of sprites go back at least to 1886, but they were first photographed on July 6, 1989 by scientists from the University of Minnesota and have subsequently been captured in video recordings many thousands of times.\n\nSprites are sometimes inaccurately called upper-atmospheric lightning. However, sprites are cold plasma phenomena that lack the hot channel temperatures of tropospheric lightning, so they are more akin to fluorescent tube discharges than to lightning discharges.\n\nBlue jets\n\nBlue jets differ from sprites in that they project from the top of the cumulonimbus above a thunderstorm, typically in a narrow cone, to the lowest levels of the ionosphere 40 to 50 km (25 to 30 miles) above the earth. In addition, whereas red sprites tend to be associated with significant lightning strikes, blue jets do not appear to be directly triggered by lightning (they do, however, appear to relate to strong hail activity in thunderstorms). \nThey are also brighter than sprites and, as implied by their name, are blue in color. The color is believed to be due to a set of blue and near-ultraviolet emission lines from neutral and ionized molecular nitrogen. They were first recorded on October 21, 1989, on a monochrome video of a thunderstorm on the horizon taken from the Space Shuttle as it passed over Australia. Blue jets occur much less frequently than sprites. By 2007, fewer than a hundred images had been obtained. The majority of these images, which include the first color imagery, are associated with a single thunderstorm. These were taken in a series of 1994 aircraft flights to study sprites.\n\nUpper-atmospheric lightning\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning\n\nSPRITE CHASING FROM THE BACK PORCH\nhttp://www.fma-research.com/Papers&presentations/spr-view-1.html\n\nSpirits of Another Sort\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/essd10jun99_1/\n\nMusic credit: Get me on the floor - Gunnar Olsen\nYouTube Audio Library", "title": "RED SPRITES & BLUE JETS - Electrical-Discharge Phenomena in the Upper Atmosphere", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T22:42:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "8IBPt1_kqZ0", "description": "quarta canzone del cd \"saziando l'uomo\" degli hirudo effect gruppo grindcore funk milanese\n\nfirst song from the album \"saziando l'uomo\" by The Hirudo Effect an italian grindcore funk band", "title": "The Hirudo Effect - Liberandoti Dalla Mia Sete", "publishedDate": "2008-12-18T16:38:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8IBapfB0Imo", "description": "This is Luke Liveforphysics cutting apart a charged 10Ah headways cell in good condition.  \n\nLiFePO4 is an extremely safe type of cell chemistry with good cycle life performance.  \n\n It is the same chemistry used by cell_man 15Ah and 20Ah pouch cells, and it's use enables a cell to be both safe from  explosions or fire, as well has high performance with a long cycle life.

This astonishing anti aging serum literally raised a great deal of brows when it appeared in thousands of gift bags at nearly every unique event and celebration in the city.\n\nOZ Naturals is very well known for their extremely effective, hyaluronic acid and because it's generally out of stock and sold solely with Amazon.com party goers were very stunned to find their gift bags contained this rare, fountain of youth gem\n\nIf you don't believe it, take a look and see if Amazon has it in stock. Their direct link is at the top of this article.\n\n... If you see that it is in stock ... GRAB IT and consider yourself lucky, because it will not be in stock when you check back later on. This stuff flies off the shelves and is never ever available for even more than a number of minutes.\n\nI spoke with Craig Romero, CEO of OZ Naturals who said their working on fortifying the production of their hyaluronic acid serum in addition to including extra service providers for bottling and labeling. \"It's astonishing how well the public has responded to our hyaluronic acid and we genuinely value it. It's been very difficult for us to keep up with the astonishing demand for the item and It's important to us that we preserve the high level of quality put into our serum, so were taking extreme measures to guarantee higher production equates into higher consumer satisfaction.\".\n\nAs a topical application, 100 % pure hyaluronic acid serum plays a part in the repair of skin cells. When used topically, through a serum or cream, hyaluronic acid kinds an air-tight layer and passes through the dermis itself, which in turn, increases the skin's hydration and flexibility.\n\nThis protective layer kinds a lock that secures wetness in, providing the skin a youthful appearance. Topical supplements containing hyaluronic acid generally ares the type of creams and/or gels.\n\nIn contrast, hyaluronic acid consumed with oral supplements assists vitamins and mineral play its crucial job in the production of collagen. Eating hyaluronic acid supplements assists the body maintain its typical collagen synthesis levels. This lets the skin stay hydrated and better resistant against wrinkles and fine lines.\n\nMany of the time, people will find hyaluronic acid through tablet supplements, either combined with an additional nutrient like collagen or alone. Hyaluronic acid serums are an additional well-used hyaluronic acid item.\n\nIn terms of anti aging, hyaluronic acid serum simply assists the body repair itself from the impacts of aging. The skin, as a noteworthy example, loses a great deal of its wetness as we continue to age. This triggers the skin to lose its flexibility, which more or less reinforces the development of wrinkles and fine lines in the skin. Hyaluronic acid can assist hold a great deal of water in the skin, which keeps it moist and less susceptible to aging-related impacts.", "title": "Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin Found In Gift Bags At Fashion Week NYC", "publishedDate": "2013-05-03T16:11:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8IXmLtBjeAE", "description": "Michigan Foot Doctor - Michigan Podiatrist - Foot and Ankle\n\nhttp://www.stopfeetpainfast.com/misaligned-feet.html\n\nIn this video, we show how the ankle and heel bone interplay, and what biomechanically is going on when you're experiencing a common form of foot pain.\nMany patients suffer from back pain, heel pain, hip pain or knee pain.

Their abdomens taper at the end, giving them a fish-like appearance. The newly hatched are whitish, but develop a greyish hue and metallic shine as they get older.They have three long cerci at the tips of their abdomens, one off the end of their body, one facing left, and one facing right. They also have two small compound eyes, despite other members of Thysanura being completely eyeless, such as the family Nicoletiidae.\n\nLike other species in Apterygota, silverfish completely lack wings.[3][6] They have long antennae, and move in a wiggling motion that resembles the movement of a fish. This, coupled with their appearance, influences their common name.

The major two components of the program were Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRUs) and regional interrogation centers. PRUs would kill suspected VC, and terrorize and capture civilians who were thought to have information on VC activities. These civilians were then taken to the interrogation centers where they were tortured in an attempt to gain intelligence on VC activities in the area. Few of the prisoners survived -- most of them were tortured to death, and those that survived the torture sessions were generally killed afterwards. The information extracted at the torture centers was then given to military commanders, who would use it to task the PRU with further capture and assassination missions.\n\nThe program was in operation between 1965 and 1972, and similar efforts existed both before and after that period. By 1972, Phoenix operatives had \"neutralized\" 81,740 suspected NLF supporters, of whom 26,369 were killed.\n\nCommon methods of torture used at the interrogation centers included:\n\n    \"Rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed by murder; electric shock ('the Bell Telephone Hour') rendered by attaching wires to the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue; the 'water treatment'; the 'airplane' in which the prisoner's arms were tied behind the back, and the rope looped over a hook on the ceiling, suspending the prisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten; beatings with rubber hoses and whips; the use of police dogs to maul prisoners.\"\n\nMilitary intelligence officer K. Milton Osborne witnessed the following use of torture:\n\n    \"The use of the insertion of the 6-inch dowel into the canal of one of my detainee's ears, and the tapping through the brain until dead. The starvation to death (in a cage), of a Vietnamese woman who was suspected of being part of the local political education cadre in one of the local villages ... The use of electronic gear such as sealed telephones attached to ... both both the women's vaginas and men's testicles [to] shock them into submission.\"\n\nLieutenant Vincent Okamoto, an intelligence-liaison officer for the Phoenix Program for two months in 1968 and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross said the following:\n\"The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist? It's not like you had their address and telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say, 'Where's Nguyen so-and-so?' Half the time the people were so afraid they would not say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take the informant, put a sandbag over his head, poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire around his neck like a long leash, and walk him through the village and say, 'When we go by Nguyen's house scratch your head.' Then that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say, 'April Fool, motherfucker.' Whoever answered the door would get wasted. As far as they were concerned whoever answered was a Communist, including family members. Sometimes they'd come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_program", "title": "Secret CIA Assassination Program: Operation Phoenix, Vietnam War Counterinsurgency", "publishedDate": "2014-08-03T13:59:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8IpROEELV3A", "description": "Diese und weitere Folgen k\u00f6nnen Sie auch auf dem Deutsch-Lernportal \"ich-will-deutsch-lernen.de\" sehen.\n\nDie Nutzung ist kostenlos.\n\nMit freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen\nDeutscher Volkshochschul-Verband e.

Since I am a guitar/music teacher I simply demonstrate to others and educate students how arrangements of tunes can be performed once you have achieved a certain level of playing. In guitar lessons I try to help students to reach higher levels of musicianship so they too can make their own finger picking arrangements as demonstrated in my videos. Certain techniques and skills are obtained through a great many sources, and mainly for my style of arrangements it has been the Chet Atkins, Merle Travis and Leo Kottke styles of playing along with many others.  So I urge students to study works and arrangements by those players to achieve the level of playing as seen in their videos or mine here. You will not find these types of finger picking arrangements I do available by the original songwriter because they never created these guitar solo-style arrangements and in most all cases cannot because they might lack the guitar skills to create in this manner.  They are solely the author of their own rendition which bares no resemblance or very little in my guitar-solo, finger style arrangement. The music for my arrangements are not available for sale in sound nor sheet music. I also am not recording these videos in front of a live-paying audience at a gig etc. But rather I film myself at my home, in my cluttered, non-stage room. These videos are non-commercial and my arrangements are considered \"transformative\"  (fair-use terminology) because they alter the original work greatly and add new meaning to them. \n Once again, no commercial gain (fair-use requirement) and no harm to the exact original copyrighted work is being done by my solo guitar arrangements.  It does not compete with the original work or serve as a substitute for it, and causes no harm to the market of the original work. (fair-use stipulations)  If anything it is a positive reflection and just might help promote the original version.\n  Also and more importantly, is the fact that my arrangements are fully original in finger picking style and I have only used a very small portion of a pre-existing music in the arrangements which is allowable under fair use copyright laws. The melody pieces are also performed on a different instrument other than the vocal voice as mostly heard in the original derivative works. Also, the melody often is not falling on the same beats as the original in many cases, and may have a different tempo and key . Nor does any other of the instrumentation contained in the original song appear in my arrangements such as drums, keyboards, voices, horns etc. It is vastly and completely different!\n   So if anybody has an issue with the name of their song (names cannot be copyrighted) and melody bits being used in a guitar-solo style arrangement then they should simply notify me and let me know how I have taken away from them in any way.  \n  After much thought and seeking legal advice I have come to find that my arrangements are covered under fair use because they are in fact different, educative, demonstrative, non commercial, and transformative and contribute to the musical culture. Therefore I will post my videos so people can see how guitar arrangements can be done (educative).\nAll one has to do is listen and see my videos to know they fall under fair use. One problem with You tube employees is they are not watching the videos to see the actual content but often delete videos because of a complaint by a third party only because a name/title is similar. I would advise you tube to watch before they delete and make erroneous judgments.  \n\nThanks very much for listening to my playing.\n\nP.S.  If anyone is interested in using my original songs for back ground music for videos or even if you play some of my own original arrangements feel free to do so. I am a musician and I write to share my music with the world! Just give credit to where credit is due and thanks for promoting my music!\n\nMusically Yours, Ray Tutaj Jr.", "title": "\"The Long and Winding Road\" Guitar Solo Fingerstyle arrangement", "publishedDate": "2010-07-09T14:49:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JGolq6V8sM", "description": "Jamming at practice", "title": "Malignant Creation", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T10:48:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JHK2v2OgV4", "description": "Watch the full Something Beautiful music video at http://www.robbiewilliams.com/video/official/something-beautiful-music-video", "title": "Robbie Williams | Escapology | 'Something Beautiful'", "publishedDate": "2009-09-11T12:18:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JHRJQK3aQ0", "description": "hey peep's, jake answers questions from facebook and also vlogging at school", "title": "Jake Answers (plus more)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T02:19:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JHSkXYMA4M", "description": "HEAVING", "title": "Battlefield 4 gameplay with Barrie Heaver", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T23:20:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JHdl513rds", "description": "Mark's Labor Day on the beach is interrupted by some beach offenders!\n\nSubscribe!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=barelypolitical\n\nFacebook!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thekeyofawesome\n\nMark's stuff:\nhttp://youtube.com/markdouglas\nhttp://twitter.com/markdouglas73\n\nTodd's Stuff\nhttp://youtube.com/wombatron\nhttp://www.twitter.com/toddwomack\n\nLaura McDonald's Website\nhttp://www.lauramcdonald.net\n\nMusic Produced by Deep V Music:\nhttp://www.deepvmusic.com\nhttp://fb.com/ihatedeepvmusic\nhttp://www.youtube.com/DeepVMusicSucks\n\nGet the songs on iTunes!\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-key-awesome-deluxe-edition/id374349910\n\nTShirts!\nhttp://thekeyofawesome.spreadshirt.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nhttp://www.twitter.com/barelypolitical\nhttp://www.twitter.com/barelydigital\n\nWrite us a letter!\nThe Key of Awesome\nP.O.

What that means orchiectomy refers to the removal of the testicle.  \n\nThe word radical implies that you're doing it for the purpose of diagnosing a cancer.  Inguinal means that you're doing it through an incision in the groin rather than making an incision in the scrotum.  When there's a suspicious that there can be a cancer in the testicle we make an incision higher in the groin area similar to an incision that would be made for a hernia operation.  What we then do through that incision  we then have access to a structure called  the spermatic cord.  The spermatic cord goes down the testicle and it carries the blood vessels and the vas which is the tube that carries sperm from the testicle.  We then encircle that cord and one of the goals of the surgery is to perform high ligation of the spermatic cord. \n\nWe dissect the cord up high and we tie it off, and divide the cord at that level.  Then we bring the testicle out through that incision remove both the spermatic cord, and the testicle itself.  This procedure again is called a radical inguinal orchiectomy and it allow us  to remove the affected testicle so that it can be sent for evaluation by the pathologist.  They then will tell us the type of cancer that is involved as well as the extent of cancer. \n\nOnce a diagnosis has been made then we go on to doing various diagnostic procedures to determine the extent of the cancer.  Now throughout the course of the treatment for testicular cancer patients may undergo chemotherapy,  they may undergo radiation, they may  not undergo any additional treatments and may just undergo surveillance which requires a series of imaging processes to make sure that there's no recurrence of cancer \n\nIn some cases where patients have extensive disease that's located up here in the abdominal area then as  urologists we will sometimes perform a procedure called a retro peritoneal lymph node dissection. This is a major operation where we enter the abdominal cavity and we remove all the lymph nodes that exist around the aorta, and vena cava.  The aorta is the largest artery in your body, and the vena cava is the largest vein in your body.  There's a series of lymph nodes that exist in fatty tissue around those structures that can be affected by spread of testicular cancer. \n\nWhen we perform that operation we are removing all the lymph nodes in that area to see where there is cancer that has spread to those sites.  Surgeries for testicular cancer can vary, but almost always there is a orchiectomy involved, and in some cases we may do this more extensive surgeries that I have talked about to remove lymph nodes from the abdominal area.  \n\nDepending on where else cancer has spread there may be a role for various other procedures that might be necessary.  For example, if there's cancer that exists in the chest and it needs to be removed sometimes we employ the assistance of thoracic surgeons to help us remove those lymph nodes as well. Depending on the extent of cancer that determines the nature of surgeries you may or may not need.  Almost everybody with testicular cancer will initially undergo a radical orchiectomy.", "title": "Testicular Cancer Surgery | Testicular Cancer", "publishedDate": "2013-08-09T16:04:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JMXo66xznc", "description": "Une \u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au CHU de Montpellier montre une virilisation anormale des championnes aux JO de Londres. \n\nD\u00e9couvrez toute l'actualit\u00e9 et les derni\u00e8res infos du Handball, Tennis, Basket, Formule 1 , Natation , cylclisme et tous les autres sports avec les analyses, les interviews et les d\u00e9cryptages des sp\u00e9cialistes de la Dream team \u00a0RMC.

I'm a reading and learning specialist at a private school in New York City and I work with Kindergarteners through 3rd graders on Reading, Word Study, and Writing Skills. In addition to be a reading specialist and learning specialist, I'm also a parent and today I'm going to talk to you about topics in reading. Phonological or phonemic awareness is a crucial factor which predicts how easily your child will develop early reading skills. It has to do with developing a sensitivity to the sound structure in oral language. At its most sophisticated level, it means phonemic awareness. Phonological awareness is the bigger umbrella which subsumes phonemic awareness. Phonological awareness can refer to noticing the words in a sentence, the syllables in a multi-syllabic word, and phonemic awareness is much more specific to the individual sounds in a single word. We call these individual sounds, phonemes. Phonemic awareness is something that develops over time and can, in fact, be taught and should be taught. Phonemes are the very smallest units of sound in words. For example, in the word bug, there are 3 phonemes. Bu-uh-ga. A child with sophisticated phonemic awareness would be able to substitute the bu- for ha, to get the word, hug, and she will also know that the initial sound changed, but the rest of the word didn't. When children receive explicit instruction in phonemic awareness, including rhyming games and substitution and segmenting tasks with individual phonemes, they are much more successful than their same peers who did not receive similar instruction.", "title": "What Is Phonemic Awareness? | Reading Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-06-17T19:28:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JNWxgL2fek", "description": "", "title": "Cherry River Planting \u00a9", "publishedDate": "2014-01-07T08:56:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JNg8I6IjwY", "description": "Owl City's latest EP, Ultraviolet available now at: http://smarturl.it/OwlCityUltravioletiT\n\nMusic video by Owl City performing Up All Night.

TuAF Chief of Operations Maj Gen Ares Mehmat was the chief guest at the culmination ceremony. PAF Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (Operations) Air Marshal Waseemud Din and Turkish Ambassador M Babur Hizlan were also present at the occasion. The Turkish Air Force contingent comprising five F16s C&D (Fighting Falcons), combat pilots and ground technical crew participated in the air exercise, conducted from March 4 to16. The Pakistan Air Force emphasises on the combat training of its air and ground crew and regularly undertakes air exercises with allied air forces. These exercises not only play a vital role in honing the combat skills of PAF aircrew but also enable them to learn the latest air power employment strategies in complex theatres of warfare. The prime objective of the exercise was to excel in the air combat capability with focus on air power employment in any future conflict. The Pakistan Air Force conducts such exercises on regular intervals both inland and abroad. Air Exercise Indus Viper II provided an opportunity to combat crew of both the air forces to acquaint themselves with applied tactics of air power in near real scenario. Pakistan Air Force has been participating in a number of international air exercises with some of the best air forces of the world, including the United States Air Force (USAF), Italian Air Force, Turkish Air Force and air forces of other allied countries. Exercise Anatolian Eagle is conducted on alternate year. Similarly, exercises Red Flag and Green Flag are conducted between the PAF and USAF on alternate years. Last year the PAF conducted the operational exercise Shaheen-I with PLA Air Force. The brotherly countries Pakistan and Turkey have a long history of military cooperation. To enhance mutual understanding between the two air forces, the PAF and TuAF have been successfully conducting joint exercises for many decades. Exercise Indus Viper-II was also planned in the same backdrop and is the second air exercise in this category.

Met straatacts, kraampjes, live muziek en vooral veel (verklede) bezoekers en een zeer gezellige, bijzondere sfeer.\n\nHet verhaal van Corvus Corax bestaat al voor 24 jaar. Na de oprichting door Wim en Castus als duo in 1989, reisden zij voor lange tijd rond als een kwintet, waarbij ze tijdelijk samen speelden met jongleurs en acrobaten in de Congregatio.  Soms waren ze op tour met 7 of 8 muzikanten,  later zelfs met 150 muzikanten en zangers op een podium: een koor, een symfonisch orkest, solisten en de groep Corvus Corax zelf voor hun grootste werk ooit: \u201cCANTUS BURANUS\u201d. Hun concerten brachten de band over heel de wereld: van Japan en China in het oosten, naar Mexico en de VS in het westen. Podia voor hun shows waren straathoeken,  kastelen, clubs, theaters, concert hallen, festivals en last but not least de grote moderne \u201cmultifunctionele hallen\u201d.\n\nNu, na drie keer zeven jaar begint de groep een nieuwe periode waarbij ze over hun schouder terug kijken , maar zonder de blik op de toekomst te verliezen. De komende zeven jaar zal Corvus Corax op podia over de hele wereld optreden met veel doedelzakken en drums. Ze zullen feesten samen met hun fans als ware \u201cKoningen der Minstrelen\u201d.\n\nCorvus Corax speelde op zaterdag op Castlefest.", "title": "Corvus Corax - Castlefest 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T16:40:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8J_18VehZuI", "description": "Value of the rhythmic group including a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note.", "title": "How to perform the rhythm : dotted eighth note + sixteenth note", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T17:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8J_bB1vI0uE", "description": "Climbers name, in order of appearance :\n0:02 - Fran\u00e7ois Lombard\n0:12 - Tony Lamiche flashes an 8a (V11) boulder, Spain\n0:21 - J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Pancol & J\u00e9r\u00f4me Meyer on the same problem\n0:26 - Daila Ojeda on \"Ratface\" (8a+/5.13c), C\u00e9\u00fcse, France\n0:30 - Said Belhaj on the Gorges du Tarn (8a/5.13b), France\n0:37 - Chris Sharma on \"Ratsaman vibrations\" (prob. 9b/5.15b), C\u00e9\u00fcse, France\n0:50 - Dave Graham flashes \"Les Arts du Vide\" (8c/5.14b) Kalymnos, Greece\n1:01 - Berta Martin\n1:05 - Philippe Ribi\u00e8re, G\u00e9tu H\u00e9, China\n1:09 - Dani Andrada sends \"El coraz\u00f3n de Ensue\u00f1o\" (8c/5.14b - 210m), China\n1:18 - Lynn Hill\n1:20 - Stephanie Bodet sends \"Lost in Translation\" (8a/5.13b - 200m), China\n1:22 - Arnaud Petit sends \"Lost in Translation\" (8a/5.13b - 200m), China\n1:26 - Mayan Smith Gobat on \"Lost in Translation\", China\n1:30 - Martina Cufar, El Chonta, Mexico\n1:32 - Orchidea Leon, El Chonta, Mexico\n1:33 - Nina Caprez sends \"Initiativa Mexico\" (8a+/5.13c), El Chonta, Mexico\n1:37 - Liv Sansoz, El Chonta, Mexico\n1:42 - Mike Fuselier sends \"Las Chicas Super Poderosas\" (8c/5.14b) Jilotepec, Mexico\n1:47 - G\u00e9r\u00f4me Pouvreau sends \"Las Chicas Super Poderosas\" (8c/5.14b)\n1:52 - Charlotte Durif sends the \"Women Ultimate Route\", Millau, France\n1:55 - Dave Graham sends \"Baston \u00e0 la maison\" (8c+/5.14c) 1st try, St G\u00e9ry, France\n2:05 - Steve McClure sends \"Kabaah\" (8c+/5.14c), Shefield, UK\n2:12 - Said Belhaj\n2:14 - Sean Villanueva sends \"Balroc\" (8b/5.13d - 250m), Piedra Parada, Argentina\n\nGet the soundtrack by Linkrust :\nhttps://soundcloud.com/linkrust/drive-me-back-to-abidjan-album-by-linkrust-and-friends\nhttps://soundcloud.com/linkrust/aconit\n\nPhotography by:\nBertrand Delapierre http://www.youtube.com/user/bdelapierre\nJulien Nadiras http://www.youtube.com/user/barakafilms38\nGuillaume Broust http://www.youtube.com/user/guillaumebroust\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nVlad Cellier http://www.youtube.com/user/barakafilms38\nMyReal Prod & Nico Fabbri http://www.nicolasfabbri.com/\n\n\nClimbing is great, psyched, dope, crazy, amazing, whatever you like!!!

The Mackie HDA High-Definition Arrayable Powered Loudspeaker System exemplifies this philosophy, delivering superior performance and unparalleled sonic quality in the most cost-effective constant curvature line array ever created. Powered by 1200W of peak system power, with a coverage pattern of 110\u00b0 x 20\u00b0, the compact 12\" 2-Way HDA loudspeakers are highly configurable. With acoustic and mechanical design by the award-winning engineering experts at EAW and patented HD audio processing, HDA offers proven line array performance and technology at a price point attainable by more users than ever before.\n\nHDA is a scalable, arrayable solution to many possible applications. This makes it the perfect choice for installers, rental houses or portable PA users that want their system to grow as needed for larger venues. A full HDA array uses four HDAs and two HD1801s per side, rigged for maximum coverage and delivering excellent low frequency directivity. And since the system is scalable, you can easily dial down the array to meet the needs of the venue.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "new 2015 PARIS HILTON TAKES HER LEXUS TO LUNCH", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:15:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Jq_SwWmK4E", "description": "", "title": "Bi\u015fkek B\u00fcy\u00fcke\u00e7isi K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7'tan Ah\u0131ska T\u00fcrklerine Ziyaret", "publishedDate": "2014-04-26T12:46:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JqeZMZ76ks", "description": "Gaming news and updates Mon, Wed, Fri.\n\nMicrosoft E3 Analysis\nhttp://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/10/microsoft-e3-press-conference-analysis.aspx\n\nForce Strategy Gaming:\nhttp://www.ForceStrategyGaming.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ForceSC2strategy\n\nMusic by: The Scession Studios http://www.youtube.com/user/thesecession", "title": "The Force Feed - Recap of Microsoft's E3 Press Conference 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-06-10T23:52:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JrB3jfrhxY", "description": "", "title": "(LAP DANCE) Girl does hot lapdance for her boyfriend", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T22:31:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JrCTB0IfbE", "description": "MTM 10-18-14 MUD TRUCK MADNESS\n\nIF YOU LIKE THIS VIDEO SUBSCRIBE!  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samcam5421\n\nFollow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jtarvers-Muddy-Motorsports-Dirty-Deeds-and-Muddin-Needs/157699230960899\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/user/samcam5421", "title": "THEMUDBOGGER79 SLINGING MUD TO THE SKY!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T23:53:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8JrfsJmyRTQ", "description": "Zosta\u0144 cz\u0119\u015bci\u0105 odwa\u017cnej i heroicznej dru\u017cyny ratowniczej, kt\u00f3ra nazywa si\u0119 \"Psi Patrol\".

The titular prince of Denmark (Mel Gibson), returns home to his family's castle of Elsinore after years of attending school in Germany to find out his father has died and his uncle Claudius (Alan Bates) is the new king. To make matters worse, Claudius has married Hamlet's mother, Queen Gertrude (Glenn Close), whom he has unusually strong feelings for. Hamlet is visited by his father's ghost (Paul Scofield), who asks him to seek revenge for his murder. In order to find out who the real killer is, Hamlet stages a theatrical scene resembling his father's death. Claudius is upset by the production and leaves to arrange for Hamlet's murder. In the ensuing confusion, Hamlet accidentally kills Polonious (Ian Holm) instead of Claudius; Hamlet's lover, Ophelia (Helena Bonham Carter), goes mad and commits suicide; and eventually Hamlet and Claudius both meet their fate.\n\nhamlet,\"hamlet clip\",\"hamlet the mini pig\",\"hamlet gonashvili\",\"hamlet 2\",\"hamlet trailer\",\"mel gibson\",\"ian holm\",\"helena bonham carter\",\"nathaniel parker\",\"franco zeffirelli\",\"bag videos\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",shakespeare,\"dyson lovell\",\"distrust videos\",\"independence videos\",\"parenthood videos\",\"truth videos\",\"castle videos\",\"courtyard videos\",hamlet,polonius,ophelia,laertes,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++21343,/m/0c1pj,/m/016zp5,/m/0dmzsk,/m/0kszw", "title": "To Thine Own Self Be True - Hamlet (2/10) Movie CLIP (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T07:11:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Jzpd0_Wc0o", "description": "Supplication is the believer weapon & only it changes destiny .Supplication is worshipping & allah gets angry with those not asking him.Allah great names by which he responds: Malik Mulk,Hannan Mannan badia of earth & skies,his names in chapter faithfulness & Yunus Duaa:No god but u Allah subhanak i ws from the unjust-3 times then asking.Allah gets down to the lowest sky in the final third of night stretching his hand & asking is there a repentant or one in need to respond .Best Times for Supplication Respons :when rain falls or ari\\mies meet or before ending(taslim) the 5 imposed prayer.Between call to prayer & prayer .Hadiths", "title": "Wednesday Supplication", "publishedDate": "2009-06-16T22:17:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K-N7_nryqs", "description": "see story here http://www.thedailypedia.com/2014/09/law-breaking-media-man-drew-flak-from-netizens/", "title": "Law-Breaking Media Man Drew Flak From Netizens", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T18:10:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K-SxRHFG8M", "description": "A review of the Rab Boreas Pull On\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Evan_Outdoors\nBlog: www.evandaviesoutdoors.blogspot.co.uk/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/evandaviesoutdoors", "title": "Review - Rab Boreas Pull On", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T14:07:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K02KtMA-ik", "description": "Please note - Android 4.2.2 is still under testing phase by Samsung.

This is a video of an organism taken from the H layer, which is below the L layer. There are fairly decomposed organic debris and humic substances in this layer. At first organisms could not be found in the newly collected soil, so the samples (including water) were left for one month and then observed.\n\n----- Commentary by Prof. Yuji Tsukii, Hosei University  -----\nIt is difficult to identify this small ciliate because neither the shape of the cell body nor the cytostome (mouth) are clear enough. We can see a mouth at the front and a contracting vacuole at the rear end.The mouth is split deeply, which resembles that of Cyrtolophosis or Protocruzia.\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Ciliophora/Cyrtolophosis/index.html\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Ciliophora/Protocruzia/index.html\nHowever, the cell shape of Cyrtolophosis looks almost like a cigarette, and it does not bend or twist frequently as the ciliate in this video does. This ciliate lacks the long frontal cilia that are characteristic of Cytrolophosis.\nSimilar to Cytrolophnsis, Protocruzia has an elongated oval shape and does not bend or twist frequently like the organism in the video.", "title": "2006\u9752\u8449\u5c71\u690d\u7269\u5712-5 Botanical Garden in Aobayama V", "publishedDate": "2014-06-01T11:25:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K0qmTqtnws", "description": "", "title": "Piekana 10.9.2011 Sodankyl\u00e4 [HD]", "publishedDate": "2011-09-13T16:59:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K10AEzUXAg", "description": "boxer TAKODA & henry aan het trainen in hoogeveen", "title": "ipo training  boxer TAKODA", "publishedDate": "2011-11-07T18:49:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K1DxvDcK3c", "description": "I uploaded this as a backup to my project", "title": "My Project-Age of Absolutism", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T04:06:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K1KV8ONyLQ", "description": "\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 YouTube \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432", "title": "Hoy Nazan - Solange Merdinian , New Docta, Sybarite 5", "publishedDate": "2014-09-08T22:26:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8K1P4UxlBkE", "description": "Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronate)\nThis bird is a frequent visitor but his visits are so short at the feeder I can't capture good clips of him.

So I built these three different Chicken Feeders with some PVC to show you how to do it too.\nI used 3\" pvc and fittings. So if you know someone who does plumbing, you might be able to get these materials a little cheaper than at the local hardware store.\n\nIf you have ever considered getting chickens, they are a great source of food and entertainment. They can live in small portable coops called chicken tractors which work great in small backyards. They can eat many of the same foods that we eat, but keep it in moderation. It is a good idea to keep them on a pellet diet if they are caged, but even better if you can let them be free range.\nIf you get your chickens when they are chicks, they will grow up knowing you and come running most of the time when you come to feed them. They can provide hours of entertainment because each one has its own personality, just like people.\n\nMatthew 14:21\n\nPlease Like and Comment\n\nOther Chicken Related Videos:\n\nHow to Train your Chickens to lay eggs where you want! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xnBIBhj3Vc\n\nHow to Prevent Soft Shell Eggs from your Chickens\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rRffDubt2k\n\nHow to Build a Chicken Brooder - Homemade Simple and Easy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YltG4yy0NMA\n\nHow to build a Simple Pet Heater for the Outdoors\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD04NlW4QLk\n\nHow to Grow Grass in a Chicken Pen\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIGmLDlDN5E\n\nTalking Animals \"That's the Guy...\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AB31bOnORY\n\nFunny Animals - Weird Drinking Chickens\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRvAiKQniBs\n\nCaution to Chicken Owners - Egg Thief\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_UDqWzeI6Q\n\n\nJust remember that PVC is only a form of hard plastic.

I hope you like it.\nIt shows a fight between a Carthaginian and a Roman trireme at the Battle of Mylae in 260 BC.\nThe Romans use their boarding bridge (lat. corvus, engl. raven) for a direct assault on the enemy ship. \n\nThe First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. For 20 years, the two powers struggled for supremacy in the western Mediterranean Sea, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters but also to a lesser extent in the Apennine peninsula and North Africa. Carthage, located in what is today Tunisia, was the dominant Western Mediterranean power at the beginning of the conflicts. However, the Roman Republic eventually emerged as the victor, imposing strict treaty conditions and heavy financial penalties against Carthage.\n\nThe series of wars between Rome and Carthage were known to the Romans as the \"Punic Wars\" because of the Latin name for the Carthaginians: Punici, derived from Phoenici, referring to the Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry.\n\nThe Battle of Mylae took place in 260 BC during the First Punic War and was the first real naval battle between Carthage and the Roman Republic. This battle was key in the Roman victory of Mylae (present-day Milazzo) as well as Sicily itself. It also marked the first development of a Roman fleet.\n\nDuilius met Hannibal off northern Mylae in 260. Polybius states that the Carthaginians had 130 ships, but does not give an exact figure for the Romans. The loss of 17 ships at the Lipari Islands from a starting total of 120 ships suggests that Rome had 103 remaining. However, it is possible that this number was larger than 103, thanks to captured ships and the assistance of Roman allies. The Carthaginians anticipated victory, especially because of their superior experience at sea.\n\nThe corvi were very successful, and helped the Romans seize the first 30 Carthaginian ships that got close enough (including the Carthaginian flagship). In order to avoid the corvi, the Carthaginians were forced to navigate around them and approach the Romans from behind, or from the side. The corvi were usually still able to pivot and grapple most oncoming ships. Once an additional 20 of the Carthaginian ships had been hooked and lost to the Romans, Hannibal retreated with his surviving ships, leaving Duilius with a clear victory.\n\nInstead of following the remaining Carthaginians at sea, Duilius sailed to Sicily to retrieve control of the troops. There he saved the city of Segesta, which had been under siege from the Carthaginian infantry commander Hamilcar. Modern historians have wondered at Duilius' decision not to immediately follow up with another naval attack, but Hannibal's remaining 80 ships was probably still too strong for Rome to conquer.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nI don\u00b4t own the rights for the music.\nMusic: Track 1: \"Riding to battle\" from the PC game \"Europa Universalis - Rome\"\n           Track 2: \"Battle music\" from the PC game \"Rome - Total War\"", "title": "\"Battle of Mylae\" (First Punic War) diorama 1/72 scale", "publishedDate": "2012-04-18T12:24:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8KEdRlV1IDk", "description": "Dans cet h\u00f4tel de Putrajaya en Malaisie, les familles esp\u00e8rent et d\u00e9sesp\u00e8rent, veulent savoir, comme cette m\u00e8re d'un jeune homme de 24 ans qui a pris ce vol Kuala Lumpur-P\u00e9kin le 8 mars dernier : \n\n\"Ca dure depuis si longtemps.

Although its cytoplasm is similar to that of Frontonia, Loxocephalus and Dexiotrica, we cannot say to which group the latter ciliate belongs without checking the shape and position of the cytostome (mouth).\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Ciliophora/Frontonia/index.html\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Ciliophora/Loxocephalus/index.html\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Ciliophora/Dexiotricha/index.html", "title": "\u7c92\u5b50\u51dd\u96c6\u4f53\u30683\u5339\u306e\u7e4a\u6bdb\u866bCiliates foraging in the same particle", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T06:54:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8KJtAsRS7MY", "description": "Learn how to keep a poodle's hind quarters nice and clean with proper dog grooming.

Having a larger surface area inside the bottle allows the flame front to propagate much more rapidly, creating a loud pop.\n\nAn interesting effect I noticed was that the bottle occasionally created an invisible vortex ring which would slam into objects on the far side of the room. In a future video I may experiment more to create a way for those vortex rings to be made more consistently.\n\nThe torch used in this video is a Bernzomatic ts8000, and the vinyl tubing is 5/8\" ID by 7/8\" OD.

Even before news hit that Colbert would replace David Letterman when he retires, Bill O'Reilly frantically declared that Colbert is responsible for the \"destruction of America.\" That's quite a distinction, when there are so many other things vying for the title of \"America's Top Destroyer.\" (Wait, reality contest show idea: \"Who will be America's Next Top Destroyer?\")\n\nMore than failing infrastructure, abject refusal to deal with the coming climate catastrophe, rampant, spiraling inequality to rival the Gilded Age, near daily mass shootings, the criminalization of poverty; or deportation of legions of innocent undocumented immigrants [insert your favorite scourge here], it is Stephen Colbert who is ushering in the decline of this great nation. In addition, O'Reilly also said, Colbert is an \"ideological fanatic,\" a \"deceiver\" and responsible for the mayhem following UConn's March Madness win.\n\nNo, we don't really get that last one either. \n\nRush Limbaugh sputtered that Colbert's promotion was \"an assault on the heartland of America,\" prompting millions of heartlanders to scurry to their bomb shelters with multiple firearms, canned goods and bottled water. He also said it represented a \"redefinition of comedy,\" a \"redefinition of what's funny.\" This is true, Rush. Comedy has been redefined to mean something that makes actual people laugh.\n\nAnd, after numerous attempts to identify the full extent of the outrage, Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro finally landed on this metaphor: In making a career out of pitch-perfect conservative pundit mockery, Stephen Colbert was guilty of no less than the moral equivalent of \"vile political blackface.\" Clever wordsmith Shapiro called this \"Conservativeface,\" a neologism that seems destined to catch on.\n\nNo word on whether Colbert is the Anti-Christ.Although a few years back a little outfit called Christfire implied as much, calling Colbert Stalinesque, Hitleresque and a bigger threat to America than Islamic terrorism.\n\nAll right ye liberals! You've been warned! Laugh your way straight into Satan's clutches.\n\n\n\n3 Steps To Join #FowlerNation!\n1. Subscribe To The Fowler Show:\nhttp://bit.ly/SubscribeFowlerNation\n2.

La r\u00e9tine est la membrane nerveuse qui re\u00e7oit la lumi\u00e8re dans la partie post\u00e9rieure de l'\u0153il.\n\nLa macula renferme la population de cellules nerveuses la plus dense ; ces cellules s'appellent les photor\u00e9cepteurs. La macula joue un r\u00f4le particuli\u00e8rement important dans la perception des d\u00e9tails et la pr\u00e9servation de la zone centrale de votre vision. \nLa vision centrale est cruciale pour les activit\u00e9s de la vie quotidiennes comme la lecture, la conduite, la reconnaissance des visages, ou encore pour composer un num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\n\nLa macula se compose de plusieurs couches de cellules sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. Les photor\u00e9cepteurs si\u00e8gent dans la partie sup\u00e9rieure d'une couche de cellules constituant l'Epith\u00e9lium pigmentaire r\u00e9tinien (EPR). Sous ces couches se trouve une fine membrane, la membrane de Bruch.\n\nSous la membrane de Bruch se trouve la choro\u00efde, un r\u00e9seau de vaisseaux sanguins assurant l'apport en oxyg\u00e8ne et en nutriments \u00e0 la macula.\n\n\u00c0 mesure que l'\u0153il vieillit, des d\u00e9bris de l'EPR et des tissus avoisinants s'accumulent au-dessus et au sein de la membrane de Bruch.\n\nCes d\u00e9bris forment des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts appel\u00e9s drusen. La pr\u00e9sence de drusen constitue g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le premier signe d'une DMLA s\u00e8che pr\u00e9coce.\n\n\u00c0 mesure que s'accumulent les drusen, ceux-ci peuvent provoquer une inflammation. Des cellules inflammatoires sont alors recrut\u00e9es par la r\u00e9tine et ces cellules, ainsi que l'EPR, commencent \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer des facteurs de croissance qui provoquent le d\u00e9veloppement de vaisseaux sanguins. Le principal facteur de croissance lib\u00e9r\u00e9 est le VEGF (facteur de croissance de l'endoth\u00e9lium vasculaire).\n\nLe VEGF, qui est une prot\u00e9ine, diffuse dans la choro\u00efde, stimulant le d\u00e9veloppement de n\u00e9ovaisseaux.
