Installation can be done on Ford Mustang years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and the new 2015 2.3-liter turbocharged 4 cylinder EcoBoost when it comes out too!  Some years are slightly different so make sure you order the louvers that best fit your car type.   I did this on my 2008 Ford Mustang which is black. It will be the same if you have a V6, V8, GT, Cobra, Shelby, or Pony Edition.\n\nWith American Muscle the custom painted durable automotive grade ABS material black louvers came with 3M adhesive tape, adhesive promoter, and rubbing alcohol pads. These really help add a classic, retro, old school look like the late 60s fastbacks had! Your Mustang coupe sports car can now kickass too by adding these badass louvers to your driver and passenger side exterior quarter windows!  In my opinion the Mustang really captures that classic hot rod muscle car look better than the Chevy Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, or Dodge Challenger do with upgrades like this! \n\nAmerican Racing offers to pre-painted all the factory Mustang colors like:  HP: Performance White, D3: Torch Red, UA: Black, U3: Grabber Orange, G5: Alloy, G9: Vista Blue, JV: Dark Candy Apple Red, ZY: Vapor Silver, PX: Dark Highland Green, P3: Windveil Blue, and YN: Silver Metallic.  Also available in matte or unpainted.\n\nYou can also probably purchase, buy, or special order these at Speed Shops, Pep Boys, Autozone, Advance Auto Parts, or where ever automotive accessories and tools are sold.\n\nTips and tricks: I recommend dry fitting the louvers first because you really want them to be flush! It's suggested that you put them on when the temperature is between 60-80 degrees. Also allow the 3M tape 24 hours to fully bond before driving your car.\n\nThere are other types of louvers you can buy like Roush, Eleanor, SHR Flush-Mount Silverhorse Racing, and CDC but I thought this kind looked the best! \n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial demonstration and it helps you along with my tips, tricks, and review!  This really isn't that hard and can be easy if you just take your time! Now you can do it yourself too!

It's quite cryptic, but here's a brief overview of the storyline...\n\n\"The two opposing forces of Numina, a mass of ever-present, fate-defining forces, have been locked in an eternal struggle since the creation of the universe. Where they were once one uneventful, infinite force, they are now split in two; one side trying to bring an end to existence and thusly returning to the infinite loop, and the other trying to keep it stretching along an infinite timeline. Our ongoing existence is simply a battleground for the forces of Numina. \n\n\"However, a key influence in this struggle has somehow evaded the battle. Without its influence, the outcome will never be decided. This influence can be described as a single Numen, and another key influence of the Numina struggle realises that The Numen must be found. Scouring the battleground of existence, the influence discovers what has happened to The Numen, and knows what must be orchestrated to re-awaken it. \n\n\"On our pane of reality, a downtrodden, broken man fights his usual, tense insomnia late one night, deeply contemplating why we all bother to live. He is not aware, however, that this evening will bring him the answers hes been looking for, the knowledge that his existence is far more important than anyone could ever realise, and that his actions will eventually resolve an epic battle he could never have imagined\"\n\n(By the way, the word \"soon\" at the end of this trailer should NOT be taken literally! ;) )", "title": "\"Numina\" Teaser Trailer", "publishedDate": "2008-12-07T19:11:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FkNtS2SCgo", "description": "Music video by Carlos Rivera performing Por Ti.

They manipulate gatekeeper molecules and infiltrate the cell nucleus with the aid of the host cell. A team of researchers headed by cell biologists and virologists from the University of Zurich, Switzerland,  have succeeded in demonstrating this mechanism in detail forthe first time.\n\nThey have been around since the dawn of time and are a model of evolutionary success: viruses. Viruses are extremely adaptable but they have a problem: They cannot reproduce, so they smuggle their genes into suitable host cells. In the case of some viruses, the viral DNA has to enter the cell nucleus to reproduce. This has been known for almost 50 years. We know, for instance, that theadenovirus disassembles its protein shell in the first step. Just how the DNA is exposed and infiltrates the host cell, however, remained unclear despite decades of research.\n\nA research group headed by Urs Greber, a cell biologist at the University of Zurich, has now managedto clear up these points. As the scientists recently revealed in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, viruses use the cell's own mechanisms. The adenovirus latches onto a gatekeeper molecule, which sits onthe nuclear pore complex in the nucleus envelope and controls the passage in and out of the nucleus. Another protein in the nuclear pore complex binds and activates a motor protein from the kinesin family, which regulates the transport of substances near the nucleus.\n\nVirus DNA uncoated with aid of host cell\n\u00abThe motor protein is in an active condition, can bind to micro-tubules and migrate along them,\u00bb says Professor Greber, explaining his team's observations. And the docked virus uses precisely this situation for its purposes. The virus binds to the kinesin and uses the energy of the motor to disrupt its own shell, which exposes the virus DNA and prepares it for transport into the nucleus. The action of the activated motor has another effect, too: The nuclear pore ruptures and becomes markedly bigger, which enables the viral DNA to enter the cell nucleus more easily. Surprisingly, the cell repairs the defective nuclear pore so that the virus breach in the nucleus does not leave any visible damage in its\nwake. The viral DNA is smuggled into the nucleus practically without trace, where it can reproduce easily.\n\nThe researchers used adenoviruses for their study. Adenoviruses cause, among other things, respiratory or epidemic ocular disease. Until recently, they were thought to be relatively harmless for healthy humans. However, the results of another research group recently demonstrated that a new kind of adenovirus triggered a dreaded zoonotic disease, meaning it was transmitted from an animal to humans before spreading from one person to another.", "title": "Manipulated gatekeeper: How viruses enter the cell nucleus", "publishedDate": "2011-10-26T07:19:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FlMEvwZTKw", "description": "This second demo of Galilean Moons showcases using the module with a vcNOIZ LFSR noise oscillator in order to generate percussive sounds.\n\nKeep an eye on this Youtube channel for more upcoming video demonstrations of Galilean Moons and other hex.net modules!\n\nFor more information than is shown below, and to check out audio demos and other modules from hexinverter.net, visit the project page here: http://cv.hexinverter.net/?projects=galilean-moons-dual-amplitude-transmutator\n\nhexinverter.net mailing list signup: http://eepurl.com/pDf_5\n\n///MODULE DESCRIPTION BELOW///\n\nFeatures\n=======================\n- Two voltage controlled digital functions (envelopes), each normalised to their own low-distortion linear, DC-coupled voltage controlled amplifier \n- Each envelope offers percussive attack/decay, attack/sustain/release or looping (LFO) mode\n- Envelopes can each be linear or exponential\n- Enables a new noise output, \"XOR\", if plugged into a Jupiter Storm behind the panel. (everything besides the XOR output works with or without a Jupiter Storm!)\n- VCA inputs are normalised to the newly-enabled XOR and main (\"I\") output of Jupiter Storm when nothing else is plugged in\n- The envelopes and VCAs can be fully utilised elsewhere in your system by plugging into the corresponding function's jacks\n- Perfect for synthesising voltage controlled percussion and other textures!\n\nDescription\n=======================\nGalilean Moons is a dual amplitude transmutator. It transmutates the amplitude of incoming signals through the use of voltage controlled envelopes and VCAs. It is designed primarily to create voltage controlled percussive sounds when fed with a sound source (in particular, its sister module, Jupiter Storm), but can be used for all sorts of other tasks in your modular system as well as to generate typical synth sounds.\n\nGalilean moons features two \"moons\". Each moon is composed of a voltage controlled attack/decay envelope with its own dedicated low-distortion linear VCA. Each envelope can also act as attack/sustain/release or can go into LFO/automatic looping mode with the flick of a switch. \n\nGalilean Moons will normalise its VCA inputs to a Jupiter Storm cosmic noise oscillator through a simple expansion cable at the back, but it can also function standalone in any modular system. Of course, the new Jupiter Storm noise output, \"XOR\", which is activated by connecting a Galilean Moons to your Jupiter Storm, will not function when you use Galilean Moons alone in a system. This is the only feature which requires a Jupiter Storm to be connected.\n\nThe XOR noise output sounds similar to (but not exactly like) Jupiter Storm with the Noise Core Disruptor is engaged, even when it is not engaged. This allows you to get both flavours of noise from Jupiter Storm simultaneously, making it a lot more versatile.\n\nThe VCAs and voltage controlled envelopes can each be used on their own in your system when you don't want to use them the way they are internally linked together. Plugging a signal into any of the respective jacks will break the internal connections and let you use the components on their own. You can use the linear, DC-coupled VCAs to control DC signals in your system when not using the module for its intended use, for example.\n\n\nTechnical Details (for built eurorack -- DIY current/depth is different!)\n==================================================\n- 18HP\n- Requires ~+88mA, -65mA @ 12V \n- 30mm deep\n\nhttp://cv.hexinverter.net/?projects=galilean-moons-dual-amplitude-transmutator\n\n88 mA +12V\n65 mA -12V\n30 mm Depth", "title": "Galilean Moons: DEMO2: Percussion with vcNOIZ", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T23:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-FlhQ1-TAmY", "description": "The Incurable is a feature film.

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[3]\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[4]\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.[5][nb 4] His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.\nShakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \"bardolatry\".[6] In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\n\nWilliam shakespeare honesty The Tempest Two Gentlemen of Verona Merry Wives Windsor Measure for Comedy Errors Much Ado About Nothing Midsummer Night's Dream Merchant Venice As You Like It Taming the Shrew All's Well That Ends Twelfth Night Winter's Tale Pericles Prince Tyre Noble Kinsmen Troilus and Cressida Coriolanus Titus Andronicus Romeo Juliet Timon Athens Julius Caesar Macbeth Hamlet King Lear Othello Antony Cleopatra Cymbeline Love's Labour's Lost Richard III John Richard II King lear\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[118] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,[119] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[120] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[121] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission", "title": "William Shakespeare :\"The Golden age... is the quote of the day", "publishedDate": "2011-11-30T08:37:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-GDkTmkdslQ", "description": "[THAI SUB] Esna - \uc544\ub7ab\uc785\uc220 \ubb3c\uace0 (Bite My Lower Lip) \n\uc0c1\uc18d\uc790\ub4e4 The Heirs OST.\nUpload by ME (DON'T RE UPLOADING)", "title": "[THAI SUB] Esna - \uc544\ub7ab\uc785\uc220 \ubb3c\uace0 (Bite My Lower Lip) \uc0c1\uc18d\uc790\ub4e4 The Heirs OST.", "publishedDate": "2014-01-29T13:27:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-GEHgcrrcXs", "description": "POR MEDIO DE TUBERIAS DE GOMA A CULQUIER RINCON DE SU OBRA LLENADO DE PANEL EXACTA HORMIGON H-25.

Until now, no direct visual evidence of Rhea's suspected ring has been detected. This perspective view shows one of a series of relatively blue patches that form a very narrow band only 10 kilometers wide that straddles Rhea's equator. This view was created using stereo topography generated by Dr. Paul Schenk (http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/schenk/) of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston Texas from Cassini imaging data returned in 2008. The bluish material is believed to be fresh ice reexposed when material from Rhea's ring struck the surface along the equator, and is a target of investigation for the March 2 Cassini flyby of Rhea. The largest craters shown here are about 20 to 30 kilometers wide and 3 to 5 kilometers deep. The colors have been enhanced to highlight the color differences between these patches and the more typical cratered terrains of Rhea.\n\ncredit: NASA / JPL / Space Science Institute / Universities Space Research Association / Lunar & Planetary Institute\n\nsource: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12854", "title": "Cassini Views Rhea's Blue Streaks In Search Of Rings", "publishedDate": "2010-03-02T01:37:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-G_2b93siyc", "description": "Unboxing Mohu The Leaf Ultimate HDTV Antenna. \nThis indoor antenna is amplified so it picks up TV signals in 50 mile range.\nI got over 55 channels!

A television crew is on hand to document the prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, and competition is fierce among the canine devotees vying for top honors. Salesman Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy), who is cursed with two left feet (literally), and his wife Cookie (Catherine O'Hara) have entered their Norwich terrier \"Winky\" in competition. Wealthy and neurotic Meg Swan (Parker Posey) and her husband Hamilton (Michael Hitchcock) are on hand with their Weimaraner \"Beatrice,\" who they fear may have been traumatized by watching them have sex. Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and his life partner Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) have brought their beloved Shih Tzu, \"Miss Agnes.\" Trophy wife Sherri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her close friend and trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) are hoping for a repeat victory for Sheri's poodle, \"Rhapsody In White.\" And Harlan Pepper (Guest), who operates a store specializing in fly-fishing gear, has decided to stack his bloodhound \"Hubert\" up against the competition. In addition to Guest, Levy, O'Hara, and Posey, several other veterans of the Waiting for Guffman cast also appear in Best in Show, including Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, and Lewis Arquette.\n\n\"best in show\",\"best in show clip\",\"best in show trailer\",\"best in show movie clips\",\"best in show busy bee\",\"best in show full movie\",comedy,\"harlan pepper\",\"christopher guest\",\"earlene luke\",\"competition videos\",\"fred willard\",\"trevor beckwith\",\"karen murphy\",\"mayflower hound judge\",\"ch quiet creeks stand by me\",\"gordon mark\",\"buck laughlin\",\"sportsmanship videos\",\"hubert the bloodhound\",\"jim piddock\",\"dog videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++209859,/m/021bk,/m/0dn58j,/m/01pcbg", "title": "Best in Show (7/11) Movie CLIP - Judging the Hounds (2000) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-03-06T21:39:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-GaMVc-5pGU", "description": "Sparky Flinstone is a social media superhero who just got out of a bad relationship and is looking for love!

Your right leg is going to spin backwards as your left hand comes across your chest onto the pole, and you're just going to leave that left foot down as that happens, and then the spin will happen. So here we go: right hand on the pole, step on the ball of your left foot, reach your right leg out, spin it backwards, hand comes to the pole, and the spin happens. So you don't have to do anything at all with the left leg. Just leave it down, and the pole naturally bends the back of your left leg. Let's do that with a walk now, give it a little more momentum. You're going to take a walk - step with your right foot, step with your left - come up, spin that right leg back, and spiral around. Everything you do with your right arm, let's do on your left as well, because you want to build your body up evenly on both sides. So we're going to take a step with our right foot, left foot, come up high on the ball of your right foot, reach your left leg out, hand comes to the pole, and it spins you around. And that is your Half-Pint!

The Belemnoidea are excluded from this tree. They are assumed being the sistergroup of Decabrachia and Octopodiformes. When we present the tree of a monophyletic group, it is always important to ask for the next relatives. The Gastropoda might be the sister group of the Cephalopoda. This is not depicted in the film, but it would lead to the following interpretation: Cephalopoda and Gastropoda together form a monophyletic clade. They obviously are descendants of a common stem species.\nCephalopoda are characterized by a conspicuous head and tentacles, which evolved from the simple molluscan foot.\nContrary to the gastropods, the Cephalopoda are characterized by a bilateral symmetrical body. \nAs an old (plesiomorphic) character, basally branching cephalopods possess an external shell. As all molluscan shells, they are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo).\nNautilus represents a \"living fossil\", a member of a widely extinct clade that \"survived\" until today and has no living very close relatives any more.\nIn the evolution of the cephalopod shells from ancestors similar to Nautilus on the stem line to the Ammonoidea, the complexity of internal and external shell-structures increased (stepwise as a result of evolution, but especially within the Ammonoidea). The suture-line of ammonites for example indicates this more complex morphology: It is the suture between septa and the wall of the shell. The shape of this suture is an important character with a systematic relevance.", "title": "Nautilus and Ammonite", "publishedDate": "2012-01-23T05:44:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-GfLxdbgnSc", "description": "Deutscher Trailer zu \"The Expendables 3\" - Kinostart: 21.08.2014\n\n\u27a4 Alle Infos & Trailer zum Film: http://goo.gl/JhTWRp\n\n---\nBitte ABONNIEREN/LIKEN nicht vergessen:\n\u2022 http://www.fb.com/vipmagazin1\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/vipmagazin\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/kinofilme\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/gamesmag\n\u2022 http://www.youtube.com/WissensMagazin\nDANKE! :)\n---\n\n\u27a4 Kinoprogramm - aktuelle Kinostarts: http://goo.gl/GVSGvo\n\u27a4 Top-10-Kino-Charts: http://goo.gl/ytrE7D\n\u27a4 Die neuesten Kinotrailer: http://goo.gl/J4YWhb\n\u27a4 Die neusten Gamestrailer: http://goo.gl/Aj6wqg\n\n---\n\nOffizieller deutscher Kino-Trailer zu dem Film \"The Expendables 3\".\n\nOriginaltitel: The Expendables 3\nActionthriller, USA 2014\nFilmverleih: Splendid Film (Fox)\nKinostart (DE): 21.08.2014\n\nSchauspieler/Darsteller: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford u.a.\n\nRegisseur: Patrick Hughes\n\n---\n\nThe Expendables are back!

Die letzte Erfolgs\u00e4ra der Fu\u00dfballabteilung, die in ihrer Geschichte einige Titel gewann, endete Mitte der 1990er Jahre. Seither hatte die Eintracht immer wieder um ihre sportliche und wirtschaftliche Existenz zu k\u00e4mpfen. Als Aufsteiger aus der Zweiten Liga nimmt Eintracht Frankfurt in der Saison 2012/13 am Spielbetrieb der Bundesliga teil.[1]\nDie Eintracht besitzt au\u00dferdem 15 weitere Abteilungen f\u00fcr verschiedene Sportarten. Die Vereinsfarben sind rot-schwarz-wei\u00df, das Vereinswappen ist der Frankfurter Adler (in rot-wei\u00df), die Spielkleidung ist traditionell schwarz-rot oder schwarz-wei\u00df.\nDie Heimspiele der Fu\u00dfballprofis werden in der Commerzbank-Arena (fr\u00fcher Waldstadion) in Sachsenhausen-S\u00fcd ausgetragen. Dort befindet sich in der Westtrib\u00fcne auch die Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle der Eintracht Frankfurt Fu\u00dfball AG. Die Trainingseinheiten der ersten Mannschaft finden direkt auf einem Au\u00dfenfeld vor dem Stadion statt und nicht mehr, wie fr\u00fcher, am Riederwald. Der Verein selbst unterh\u00e4lt seine Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle am 1952 eingeweihten Sportplatz am Riederwald im Frankfurter Stadtteil Seckbach.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt is a German sports club, based in Frankfurt, Hesse that is best known for its association football club.

However, because he was only the Inkosi's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan (the so-called \"Left-Hand House\"[8]), the descendants of his branch of the royal family were not eligible to succeed to the Thembu throne.\n\n\nNelson Mandela circa 1937[9]\nMandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, served as chief of the town of Mvezo.[10] However, upon alienating the colonial authorities, they deprived Mphakanyiswa of his position, and moved his family to Qunu. Despite this, Mphakanyiswa remained a member of the Inkosi's Privy Council, and served an instrumental role in Jongintaba Dalindyebo's ascension to the Thembu throne. Dalindyebo would later return the favour by informally adopting Mandela upon Mphakanyiswa's death.[11] Mandela's father had four wives, with whom he fathered thirteen children (four boys and nine girls).[11] Mandela was born to his third wife ('third' by a complex royal ranking system), Nosekeni Fanny. Fanny was a daughter of Nkedama of the Mpemvu Xhosa clan, the dynastic Right Hand House, in whose umzi or homestead Mandela spent much of his childhood.[12] His given name Rolihlahla means \"to pull a branch of a tree\", or more colloquially, \"troublemaker\".[13][14]\nRolihlahla Mandela became the first member of his family to attend a school, where his teacher Miss Mdingane gave him the English name \"Nelson\".[15]\nWhen Mandela was nine, his father died of tuberculosis, and the regent, Jongintaba, became his guardian.[11] Mandela attended a Wesleyan mission school located next to the palace of the regent. Following Thembu custom, he was initiated at age sixteen, and attended Clarkebury Boarding Institute.[16] Mandela completed his Junior Certificate in two years, instead of the usual three.[16] Designated to inherit his father's position as a privy councillor, in 1937 Mandela moved to Healdtown, the Wesleyan college in Fort Beaufort which most Thembu royalty attended.[17] At nineteen, he took an interest in boxing and running at the school.[12]\nElizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926[note 1]) is the constitutional monarch of 16 sovereign states known as the Commonwealth realms, and head of the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations. In her specific role as the monarch of the United Kingdom, one of her 16 realms, she is also Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\nElizabeth was born in London, and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as George VI in 1936 on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, in which she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. On the death of her father in 1952, she became Head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. Her coronation service in 1953 was the first to be televised. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics.

Companies that do business internationally commonly need to pay or receive payment in currencies other than their own. The problem for these companies is that in the time between agreement on a contract price for good or services and delivery there may be a substantial price change in a given currency pair. Forex hedging is done to reduce the currency risk involved in these situations.\n\nForex hedging commonly involves Forex options trading. A possible scenario may go like the following example.  A US company wishes to buy German machine parts. The two companies agree on a price to be paid in Euros to the German company by its US customer. When the parts are delivered the US company has to pay. If the Euro has risen in relation to the dollar the US company will need to pay more dollars than expected for the machine parts. The German company will receive the same amount of Euros no matter what. In Forex hedging the US company buys calls on the Euro with dollars at the time that it signs the contract to buy machine parts. It buys calls on enough Euros to pay the contract price. If, in fact, the dollar goes down and the Euro goes up in price the US Company will execute the calls on Euros and buy Euros at the exchange rate that was current when the contract was signed. It will pay the expected amount in dollars and receive the expected amount in Euros with which it will pay for the machine parts. The cost of Forex hedging in this manner is the cost of the options contracts involved.\n\nAn alternative in Forex hedging is to attempt to read the fundamentals and technical factors that drive a given currency pair such as the Euro USD pair. If the individual or company believes, in the example above, that the Euro will go up in price, he will buy Euros at the time the contract is signed and hold them for later payment. The problem with simply buying Euros is that the individual or company loses flexibility. For example, let us say that in the machine parts example above the dollar rises in relation to the Euro. The individual who bought Euros early will not benefit. However, the one who used Forex hedging by way of buying calls will simply not execute the contract. He will, rather, purchase Euros, using fewer dollars than he expected to pay to buy the required amount of Euros. He will receive his machine parts as a discount because he did not buy early. He also insured himself against currency risk by purchasing calls.\n\nForex hedging is a major part of Forex trading as it is integral to world trade for those dealing internationally to contain their currency risk while doing business in the four corners of the globe. Whether the trader seeks to anticipate price movements or use options trading as insurance Forex hedging can save substantial sums of money in doing business across borders.", "title": "Forex Hedging", "publishedDate": "2011-05-09T19:53:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-GsBi5Uw4II", "description": "I can't describe my feeling inda first time I saw this video..

It's also naturally found in human skin but gets depleted over time. Lycopene belongs to the family of intensely coloured anti-oxidants known as Carotenoids, which are found within the lipid layers of the skin. It plays a major role in skin health and influences the colour of your skin. Lycopene may be the best free radical scavenger among carotens - it is at least twice as effective an antioxidant as beta carotene.Health Benefits\u2022 Fighting Cancer -- Several studies that eating vegetables rich in lycopene, such as tomatoes or tomato-based products, may reduce the risk of getting cancer. Carotenoids work to protect against cancer and aging-related diseases by acting as an antioxidant to counteract damaging effects of free radicals in tissue.\u2022 Preventing heart diseases -- lycopene is found to prevent oxidation of lipids and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and reduced the risk of a person developing atherosclerosis and coronary heart diseases.\u2022 Keeping skin healthy - lycopene may help reduce the damage to the skin caused by UV light during and after sun exposure.

We are being prepared for the imposition of Martial Law by our government, a government that is no longer represents We The People and one that cannot be trusted.  The people in control of our government right now have everything in place to impose total tyranny on our society.  All they need is an event they can call a national emergency.  And don't think it's not possible that they wouldn't manufacture one.  \n\nYou need to watch Big Brother, Big Picture.  This presentation will reveal exactly who is orchitrating the global government, and how they are doing it, ALL OVER THE WORLD.\n\nBig Brother, Big Picture\nhttp://www.kickthemallout.com/article.php/Video-Big_Brother_Big_Picture\n\nAlso check out TERROR STORM a brilliant film that documents many cases in which our own government has staged terror events to advance their agendas.  \n\nTerror Storm\nhttp://www.kickthemallout.com/staticpages/index.php/Rapid-U_Terror_Storm\n\nAnd after watching Terror Storm, please check out this little, short 14 minute film about 9-11\n\nTHE TOP 4 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON 9-11\nhttp://www.kickthemallout.com/staticpages/index.php/Revisit_9-11\n\nThe bottom line is we cannot trust the people running our government.  It's pure folly to think they can protect us from anything.  A truly safe society comes from and empowered public, not one that cowers at the feet of their government.  \n\nIf you want to stop this insanity, we have to take back control of our government from the maniacs that has control of it now.

As an official military observer, Steidle had access to parts of the country that no journalist could penetrate. He was unprepared for what he would witness and experience, including being fired upon, taken hostage, and being unable to intervene to save the lives of young children. Ultimately frustrated by the inaction of the international community, Steidle resigned and returned to the US to expose the images and stories of lives systematically destroyed. Haunted by what he has seen and the backlash against his advocacy efforts, Brian traveled to the refugee camps of Chad to reconnect with survivors of the violence he witnessed.

Utilizing two, 4\" U-bolts, the actuator was vertically mounted to a 2\"x8\"x8' piece of pressure treated lumber placed on-end horizontally between two, 41\" tripod supports. Testing was performed by attaching the foam and rubber insert clamp to the base of the selected plants and retracting the actuator in an upwards motion until the plant's root system became detached from the green roof media.

The significantly refreshed 2014 Toyota Tundra will now carry a base price of $26,915 for a regular-cab rear-drive model with a 4.0-liter V-6. Toyota isn't going to leave the luxury truck market to GMC, Ford, Chevrolet, and Ram, though -- the 2014 Tundra Platinum and 1794 Edition will carry identical MSRPs of $48,315 in CrewMax form, with four-wheel drive and a 5.7-liter V-8. All prices include the $995 destination charge. Toyota claims that the 2014 Tundra lineup's prices are, on average, $263 lower than comparable 2013 models. The 2014 Tundra is offered in SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, and 1794 Edition forms, as a regular cab, double cab, or CrewMax. The double cab and CrewMax are offered with a bench or bucket seats in the front. Engines include a 270-hp 4.0-liter V-6 for the base SR trim as well as a 310-hp 4.6-liter V-8 for the SR and SR5 trims. Of course, the engine we'd pick is the 381-hp 5.7-liter V-8, which is offered on every trim from the SR to the Platinum and 1794 Edition trucks. The V-6 uses a five-speed automatic while the V-8s get a six-speed unit.\nToyota Tundra SR5 2014 - Test Off road", "title": "Toyota Tundra SR5 2014 - Test Off road", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T20:48:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HgPkilTaRs", "description": "Spring Compliance", "title": "1_Spring Compliance", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T17:15:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Hh5MoHVEk4", "description": "steeper turn in a diamond air Katana (DV20) - pilot working hard to maintain altitude, not so badly done ;-)", "title": "non-standard turns in Katana (DV20)", "publishedDate": "2006-06-23T15:46:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Hh6h_INQ-s", "description": "Mc 2F Do Tufa - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mc-2F/668302859884220\nTwitter - @fafa2f\nInstagram - 2f_fafa", "title": "Mc 2F Do Tufa -  Sai pra l\u00e1 invejoso", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T21:22:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HhSG7JZ6mw", "description": "\u00c0 l'occasion 25e anniveraire de Pixcom, l'enthousiaste Pierre-Paul Paquet (Mathieu Pichette - Les pieds dans la marge, Le monde en gros) s'offre un retour - habile et subtil - sur les productions de Pixcom r\u00e9compens\u00e9es de prix G\u00e9meaux. \n\nR\u00e9alisateur: F\u00e9lix Tanguay\nAuteurs: Mathieu Pichette, Barclay Fortin\nProductrice web: Nadine Dufour\nRecherche et coordination: Sophie Beaulieu, St\u00e9phanie Gagnon\nMontage: Services Vid\u00e9o Quartzz\nMix Sonore: AudioZone", "title": "PIXCOM PR\u00c9SENTE : LES GRANDES ENTREVUES (avec Pierre-Paul Paquet) | G\u00e9meaux", "publishedDate": "2013-01-23T16:28:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HhTrg_iXgY", "description": "This is a video tutorial on how to remove or replace the inner or outer barrel of a 1911 blowback airsoft pistol.  \n\nGun used: KJWorks 1911 GBB-617 KP-07\n\nCamera: Nikon D3200 w/ 18-200mm lens\n\nVideo Editor: Adobe Premiere Elements 10\n\nEnjoy\n\n-Derek", "title": "How to Remove or Replace the Inner and Outer Barrel of a 1911 Blowback Airsoft Pistol Video Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T04:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HhUhPK9_Zw", "description": "edited by Martinez'\nI don't have full copyrights for this video materials & music cover\n\nMacedonian national football team through FIFA World Cup Brasil 2014 qualification\n_____________________________________________________________________\nsoundtrack: Dark Knight Rises - Hans Zimmer", "title": "Macedonian Football - The new era rises (intro)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-22T02:09:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Hi8uDAXRPg", "description": "Breast Augmentation and Breast Lift Testimonial from The Gallery of Cosmetic Surgery, Seattle, WA.

I wasn't satisfied/happy with the way that they looked.  \n\nBefore I would wear push up padded and it was like, false advertising.  You take them off and somebody would be like \"oh\" (laugh).  \n\nA girl that I had worked with at the time had had her breasts done by Dr. Craig Jonov.  I decided on Dr. Jonov because he made me feel very comfortable, he felt very knowledgeable and I was comfortable with his staff and him and I'm very pleased with my results.  \n\nI think I tend to be somebody who calls a lot and asks a lot of questions and I never feel like I'm irritating them or their putting me off and also the amount of time that Dr. Jonov gives you in your pre-op and post-ops.  And he's honest, very blunt, like if I have a question, and is very real about your expectations.  I don't feel like he sells you a false expectation. \n\nI feel like it made me rewind ten years, the perkiness that I got (laughter).  When I take off my bra, I feel like they still look the same as they did in the bra.  It makes you feel a lot better about yourself as a woman.\n\nThank you for dealing with me and putting up with my neurotic behaviors about surgeries and I'm excited for my upcoming surgery and can't wait to see the results.\n\nGet a complimentary consultation with Dr. Craig Jonov: Contact us online at http://goo.gl/hfSm9v or call 425-329-4200", "title": "Breast Lift and Breast Augmentation Testimonial from The Gallery of Cosmetic Surgery, Seattle, WA", "publishedDate": "2014-04-18T20:43:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HiyFEniH7w", "description": "", "title": "EXOGEN-funktionsmekanismvideo", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T07:50:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HjBnyea6QI", "description": "A female bee assassin bug, Apiomerus flaviventris (Reduviidae: Hemiptera), collects resin from common desert shrub, brittle bush (Encelia farinosa) in Southern California.

Chemical compounds have a unique and defined chemical structure; they consist of a fixed ratio of atoms that are held together in a defined spatial arrangement by chemical bonds. Chemical compounds can be compound molecules held together by covalent bonds, salts held together by ionic bonds, metallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, or complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Substances such as pure chemical elements and elemental molecules consisting of multiple atoms of a single element (such as H2, S8, etc.) are not considered chemical compounds.\nElements form compounds to become more stable. They become stable when they have the maximum number of possible electrons in their outermost energy level, which is normally two or eight valence electrons. This is the reason that noble gases do not frequently react: they already possess eight valence electrons (the exception being helium, which requires only two valence electrons to achieve stability).\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "What Is A Chemical Compound", "publishedDate": "2010-04-30T07:15:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Hjiw1Ddpxc", "description": "Murder defendant Byron Adams told a Lee County Judge that he feels like he's been \"pushed into a corner\" to get rid of his attorney and represent himself at his upcoming trial.

From early childhood it was obvious that her destiny was music.\n\nGheorghiu made her international debut in 1992 at Royal Opera, Covent Garden (Mim\u00ec, La Boh\u00e8me), at the Metropolitan Opera, and at the Vienna State Opera. It was in the Royal Opera, Covent Garden that she first sang her much acclaimed La Traviata in 1994, when the BBC cleared out its schedules to broadcast the opera.\n\nHer first exclusive recording contract was in 1995 with Decca. The second was in 1998 with EMI, for whom she made several recordings released on CD and DVD. The latest releases include the complete opera recordings of L'Amico Fritz by Pietro Mascagni and Fedora by Umberto Giordano (both with Deutsche Grammophon), the live performance of La Rondine at the Metropolitan Opera (2009), as well as Faust from Royal Opera House (2004), released on DVD by EMI Classics in 2011. Adriana Lecouvreur (a Royal Opera production recorded in 2010) was released on DVD in 2012.\n\nHaving always earned spectacular reviews on her career, Gheorghiu was honored with La Medaille Vermeille de la Ville de Paris and was appointed an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres and Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture and by her native country Romania. In December 2010 she was awarded the honorific title of Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Arts in Iasi (Romania) and the Star of Romania, the highest decoration given by the by the President of Romania.

Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its biological importance is due to tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives after its conversion to dihydrofolic acid in the liver.\n\nVitamin B9 (folic acid and folate) is essential to numerous bodily functions. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in certain biological reactions. It is especially important in aiding rapid cell division and growth, such as in infancy and pregnancy. Children and adults both require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anemia.\n\nFolate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word folium (which means \"leaf\").  Leafy vegetables are principal sources of folic acid, although in Western diets fortified cereals and bread may be a larger dietary source.\n\nA lack of dietary folates leads to folate deficiency, which is uncommon in normal Western diets.\nA complete lack of dietary folate takes months before deficiency develops as normal individuals have about 500--20,000\u00a0\u00b5g of folate in body stores. This deficiency can result in many health problems, the most notable one being neural tube defects in developing embryos. Common symptoms of folate deficiency include diarrhea, macrocytic anemia with weakness or shortness of breath, nerve damage with weakness and limb numbness (peripheral neuropathy), pregnancy complications, mental confusion, forgetfulness or other cognitive declines, mental depression, sore or swollen tongue, peptic or mouth ulcers, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders.  Low levels of folate can also lead to homocysteine accumulation. DNA synthesis and repair are impaired and this could lead to cancer development.", "title": "Folic acid", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T00:20:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HrOPqZrwok", "description": "Quantity Surveyor and University of South Wales lecturer David Harper introduces Building Information Modeling (BIM) and explains its role in construction and surveying.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.southwales.ac.uk/surveying/\n\nDownload our undergrad app UniBox USW: http://www.southwales.ac.uk/app/", "title": "Study surveying - Explaining Building Information Modelling (BIM)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T09:41:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-HrQYy0l10c", "description": "Salita della cupola della Mole Antonelliana, sede del Museo Nazionale del Cinema di Torino.", "title": "La salita della Cupola - Museo Nazionale del Cinema di Torino", "publishedDate": "2013-07-02T12:41:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Hrv8xp4agc", "description": "Thank you for 30.000 subscribers !!

In this sequel, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) summons chaos theorist and onetime colleague Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to his home with some startling information -- while nearly everything at his Jurassic Park had been destroyed, engineers were also operating a second site, where other dinosaurs, resurrected through DNA cloning technology, had been kept in hiding. Hammond has learned the dinosaurs on the second island are alive and well and even breeding; Hammond wants Malcolm to observe and document the reptiles before Hammond's financiers can get to them. Malcolm declares he had enough of the dinosaurs the first time out, but decides to make the trip when he finds out that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is already there. However, Ian and Sarah aren't the only visitors expected on the island; a camera crew led by ecological activist Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) is on the way, as is Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), a world-class wild game hunter who is supposed to round up the dinosaurs and who hopes to bag a prehistoric trophy for himself in the process. This sequel to Jurassic Park boasted even more impressive special effects than the first film, though the acting and screenplay aren't always at the same level.\n\n\"the lost world jurassic park\",\"vince vaughn\",\"jeff goldblum\",\"julianne moore\",\"steven spielberg\",\"backpack videos\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"gerald r molen\",\"survival videos\",\"island videos\",\"jungle videos\",\"trailer videos\",\"dr ian malcolm\",\"dr sarah harding\",\"nick van owen\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom", "title": "The Lost World: Jurassic Park (9/10) Movie CLIP - Downtown Rampage (1997) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-04-19T18:30:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-IF2wOzPLWk", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez le nouveau clip d'Agn\u00e8s \"On and On\" !", "title": "AGNES - ON AND ON (new video exclu)", "publishedDate": "2009-11-19T13:23:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-IF9QLnXeSQ", "description": "The P4 visits the Elio plant in Shreveport, LA.", "title": "P4 Visits Elio Plant", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T13:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-IFNZfDdhmw", "description": "Gucci Mane - Panoramic Roof Ft.

First we see the Eiffel tower, constructed in 1889 and designed by Gustave Eiffel. He was inspired by the recent advent of the use of iron in construction.\nNext we see starry night over the Rh\u00f4ne by van Gogh. He painted this masterwork in 1888. He was inspired by the recently invented gas lights that had been installed along the waterfront which created interesting lighting effects for him to capture on canvas.\nThe music is Gymnop\u00e9die No.1 by Erik Satie, composed in 1888. This piece is widely credited as being one of the precursors of modern ambient music, and uses interesting chord progressions that were considered innovative in the time when the piece was composed. \nAll three works are tied together for me by the colour dark blue -- the blue of the night sky as the Eiffel tower soars to the highest point in Paris; The blue of the night sky in Van Gogh's beautiful artwork, and the blue tone of the Gymnop\u00e9die that ambles sadly along its melody.\nThese artworks/designs were not immediately popular in their time -- the Eiffel tower was hated by architects of the time, Satie was widely ignored by his contemporaries, and van Gogh committed suicide at 37 without having his genius acknowledged.

Since I was so interested in these types of plants I just couldnt resist the temptation to take some photos.It is indeed a great pleasure and a unique opportunity to see these very uncommon plants and to study it. This is another area which I really like in nature.  Though it is a simple capture I hope you have got an idea of this unusual plant..\n\n\nAristolochia Littoralis \n=============== \nPlant Common Name \nCalico Flower, Elegant Dutchman's Pipe \n\nAristolochia littoralis is an evergreen vine with large, heart-shaped flowers. The plant is native to Brazil, and is an invasive species in the southern United States and Australia where it kills the caterpillars of the threatened Richmond Birdwing Butterfly. \n\nFlowers are large and trumpet shaped with intricate brown markings, winged seeds are borne in dry capsules that split like small parachutes. \n\nAristolochia is a genus of evergreen and deciduous woody vines and herbaceous perennials. These flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism. The plants are aromatic and their strong scent attracts insects. The inner part of the perianth tube is covered with hairs, acting as a fly-trap. These hairs then wither to release the fly, covered with pollen.These infamously scented blossoms occur in summertime. \n\nThe light to medium green leaves are kidney- or heart-shaped, and are rather small when compared to others; the soft woody stems coil around things for support. In the heat of summer. \nGrow calico flower in a very rich, humusy soil in partial shade in a frost-free region. It appreciates warmth, humidity and soil moisture and quickly covers a sturdy wall or upright support or tree. Use it as a conversation-piece in the tropical garden, but not too close to outdoor sitting areas where food may be served as a pre-meal sniff of a flower can turn stomachs.", "title": "Aristolochia Littoralis - Calico Flower, Elegant Dutchman's Pipe", "publishedDate": "2011-06-29T09:31:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-IbTzsD5riM", "description": "http://video.news.sky.com/skynews/video/     \nNearly a week after Haiti was devastated by a massive earthquake charities are warning of an increase in looting as people left with nothing fight over aid and supplies.

Stick double sided sticky tape on the base hole in press fit a flexible pipe in it. This will be the INLET tube. Stick another tape on the cylindrical surface and stick a piece of foam on it.

Overture (Introduction)\n2. The Bureaucrat (Polka)\n3. The Drayman's Dance (Variations)\n4. Kozelkov's Dance with Friends (Tango)\n5. Intermezzo\n6. The Dance of the Colonial Slave-Girl\n7. The Conciliator\n8. General Dance of Enthusiasm and Apotheosis (Finale)\n\nComposer: Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975)\nConductor: Dmitry Yablonsky\nPerformer: Russian State Symphony Orchestra\nWorld Premiere: April 8, 1931 at the Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, Leningrad\n\nShostakovichs second ballet is a caustic and colourful tale of skulduggery and counter-revolutionary wickedness in a Soviet factory. The drunken and lazy Lyonka hates his work. Encouraged by a dangerous and subversive anti-Soviet schemer and also by the appalling example of the (equally drunken) local priest and his lazy and ignorant congregation, Lyonka is drawn into a plot to sabotage his factory by dropping a large bolt into a piece of machinery. Only the noble intervention of a group of brave Young Communists succeeds in saving the workplace and protecting the revolutionary future from the reactionary forces of darkness and conservatism.\n\nThe waspish and delightfully colourful score bowls along like a childrens cartoon-film, every number full of drama and parody and fine take-offs of serious and popular music of every kind. Among the highlights are the opening scene when the workers gather in the morning for their physical fitness class before hitting the conveyor belts, the appearance of pompous and opinionated officials and bureaucrats, a ridiculous church-going episode, and the exciting scene when the sabotage-conspiracy nearly succeeds and is only foiled at the last moment. There are also plenty of numbers which mimic the whirling and hammering sounds of modern factory machinery.\n\nThe original choreography was by the outstanding Fyodor Lopukhov, later famous for his restagings of the ballet-classics, but at this period best known for his avant-garde work. In The Bolt he made much play with dancers imitating the workings of machinery.

Winter Ants (Prenolepis imparis species) are very active in the winter and usually have a single colony entrance with a long thin tunnel leading to pad like chambers fairly deep in the ground. I was not aware of this type of ant until I started this project and they first caught my attention last winter, being the only ants that were actually active at near freezing temperatures. The are also known as false honey ants.\n\nThe tunnels are very narrow, being only around 3/16\" in diameter on average. I used zinc on this cast because it tends to stay in a liquid state for longer than aluminum, so it can really flow deep through the deep and narrow tunnels. \n\nThe final cast is 40\" (3'-4\") deep, which is by far the deepest colony that I have cast so far. The chambers are fairly small being only around 3.5\" at their widest. The final cast is mounted on an oak board with supports for the cast at various places along the cast. The narrow tunnels broke in several places when I was digging it up, so I had to mount it in a way that pieced it together and used glue at several places.\n\nSee detailed pictures of the resulting display at http://www.anthillart.com/castings/058/", "title": "Casting a Winter Ant Colony with Molten Zinc (Cast #058)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T01:30:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-IzkC3Lf9Fc", "description": "Featuring the world premiere of Anomykz by Ofilio Portillo commissioned by Harbourfront Centre along with works by Colin Connor and Deborah Lundmark, CCDT Artistic Director.", "title": "CCDT: Fulcrum 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-18T16:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-J-5qASZhxM", "description": "On Ebay Seller: tweetymkg Check it out!\n\n A Great Find \nfrom TWEETY's TREASURES NEST     \n\n Lyrics are Tweedle-lee-dee-dee-, tweedle-lee-dee-dee, tweet, tweet, tweedle-lee-dee(chickens sing)\n\nThen the rabbit sings:\n\"Early Easter morning I come hopping along, kicking up my heels and a singing this song.

That is when a gallstone slips out of the gallbladder and gets lodged in the duct that drains both the gallbladder and the pancreas. \n\nThat back pressure from that obstructing stone causes inflammation within that pancreas and can cause nausea, vomiting, and pain. The pain can be fairly severe, and the illness can be fairly severe.\n\nThe other, next common cause of acute pancreatitis is alcohol consumption. A lot of alcoholics can cause inflammation of the pancreas causing pain and can progress to chronic pancreatitis, where they have chronic abdominal pain, nutritional deficiencies and may develop diabetes.\n\nOur pancreas is very delicate organ. We try to protect it by not exposing it to to many toxins such as alcohol, or any environmental toxins. So the pancreas has two roles. One is the exocrine function, and one is the endocrine function.\n\nThe endocrine function is basically forming insulin to help in the management of our blood sugars. Any failure within the endocrine pancreas can cause diabetes.\n\nThe exocrine pancreas is basically the hormones that are secreted for the pancreas that help to digest fats, and help with digestion in general. The enzymes that are produced by the pancreas are lipase and amylase, and that helps with digestion of carbohydrates.", "title": "What Is Pancreatitis? | Stomach Problems", "publishedDate": "2012-10-20T23:16:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-J8rVSpuZdA", "description": "Check out this group as they sing \"Mangalyam\" from the movie \"Sathiya\" at the JNC fest, Scintillation 08\nhttp://www.minglebox.com/scintillation", "title": "JNC - Scintillation 08 -Group singing", "publishedDate": "2008-02-25T12:12:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-J902M50JEk", "description": "Ventas:\nwww.nationalsoft.com.mx\nwww.softrestaurant.com.mx\nventas@nationalsoft.com.mx\nventas.df@nationalsoft.com.mx\n\nSoporte T\u00e9cnico :\nwww.nationalsoft.mx/soporte", "title": "Tutorial - Soft Restaurant\u00ae 2011 - Punto de Venta", "publishedDate": "2010-12-03T22:32:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-J9LCY3gEAE", "description": "something different from the pressure man ALEX B, chutney soca , mix up style!!! somebody say pressure EYYUUH!!", "title": "Alex B- Just ah friend (CHUTNEY/SOCA 2013) PRODUCED BY SURENDRA RAMOUTAR & JAY-DE NUTATION RECORDS", "publishedDate": "2013-01-01T14:45:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-J9VfllZpEM", "description": "Dale just can't shake his addiction to.........

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays. The National League, originally founded in 1876, consists of the following teams: Arizona Diamondbacks; Atlanta Braves; Chicago Cubs; Cincinnati Reds; Colorado Rockies; Los Angeles Dodgers; Miami Marlins; Milwaukee Brewers; New York Mets; Philadelphia Phillies; Pittsburgh Pirates; San Diego Padres; San Francisco Giants; St. Louis Cardinals; and Washington Nationals.\n \nVisit MLB.com: http://mlb.mlb.com\nSubscribe to MLB.TV: mlb.tv\nDownload MLB.com At Bat: http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/atbat\nGet tickets: http://mlb.mlb.com/tickets\nOfficial MLB Merchandise: http://mlb.mlb.com/shop\n \nJoin the conversation!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mlb\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mlb\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/mlb\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+MLB\nTumblr: http://drawntomlb.com/\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/MLBAM", "title": "CIN@NYY: Kuroda allows one unearned over 6 2/3 frames", "publishedDate": "2014-07-20T21:35:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JKm6kDbrUI", "description": "Our Mini Pin Lilly finally gave birth,...\nAfter the first boy, the 2nd and 3rd boy got out by cesarian,...\nAll 3 of them are doing well,...", "title": "Beautiful Life", "publishedDate": "2012-04-22T15:18:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-JL3p538vwU", "description": "Unissued / Unused material. \n\n\n\nLocation of events unclear / unknown. \n\n\n\nM/S General Bernard Montgomery sat with other officers.
