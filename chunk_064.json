Based on data from CEMRC, it appears there was a follow on radioactive spike at WIPP as measured by filters recovered February 23rd 2014.\n\n While the 2/23/14 Plutonium spike appears much less than the Valentine's day spike, the important factor of note is that the process which caused the Valentine's day explosion is still ongoing. It should also be noted the CEMRC suspiciously changed their sampling reporting style concurrent with this new event in such a manner that the change served to obfuscate the obviousness of the spike.\n\n CEMRC switched their reporting to a daily aggregate of filter samples with data starting 2/22/14. Aggregate reporting serves to peanut butter out large radioactive volumetric spike rates which occurred during a short time period into a greatly reduced spike smoothed out over a larger time period. Even with that distortion, the 2/23 spike was at least 400% greater than the previous days.\n\nHad CEMRC maintained an Engineering Consistency in how they reported their measurements, it is likely the true amount of Plutonium measured per cubic meter would have shown 10 to 100 times greater than reported.\n\nIt is also clear from the WIPP data that HEPA filters were not activated until the majority of Plutonium had escaped on Valentine's day; see the above video for more details\n\nfor source data visit\nhttp://pissinontheroses.blogspot.com/2014/03/alert-2nd-plutonium-spike-has-occurred.html", "title": "ALERT!

A sense of grandeur. These topiary balls are artificial hedge balls and are often placed near doorways or entrances to give a grand appeal. Think the palace at Versailles or the White House. The effect however, is understated -- not ostentatious.\n\nBoxwood Topairies - Artificial Boxwood Hedge Wholesale\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqjEGIO6JuI\n\nGeranium Street Floral

dusk with grief, from afar, I mused over the world\nWith a heart beat deafening as the high open seas\nWith an unscathed memory yet stitched by felonies\nWith the gift to carve out words on branches\n\nMy friends of old playthings of time\nOften would appear in troubled dreams\nTo relate in smothered cries of pain\nThe oblivion of the herd grazing down below\n\nBut I keep my spirit cold, alert, my love aflame \nI do not give way to tears, I refute the lie\nI serve beauty; sweet is the grape of the vine\nWhich wets the fingertips and sprinkles dew on my  lips\n\nAnd those who lie in wait to drink up my tears\nThose who spread fear into each of my generations\nTheir eyes agape they gaze at the bottomless pit\nLike fish hanging on bail in beamless chasms

The first track from the experimental music project 'Emotional machines' based on the use of everyday sounds instead of musical instruments. Although traditional drums and vocals are present in the tracks the large porportion are sounds recorded from everyday life. In this particular track, cars, buses, garage doors and kitchen appliances are utilised. Influenced by the futurist art music movement of Musique Concrete of early 20th century led by Henri Schaefer, 'Emotional machines' is a testament to the ideas that were born more than a century ago before the age of technology.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the notion of what actually constituted music was under intense debate. Many emerging genres that broke with convention such as noise-art, electronic music, computer music, even punk rock, rap and hip hop, were considered 'non-music' or 'noise' at their inception and received strong resistance from critics and audiences alike.\n\nToday we have a clearer understanding that the creation, performance, significance and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context.\n\nIn his work 'Emotional machines', Taylor explores the boundaries of how everyday sound sources can be used in combination and in context with computer audio technology, within the diverse musical. \n\nWe hear a plethora of everyday sounds and noises, crashed together with a select palette of traditional sounds to create a musical deconstruction that breathes life into the sounds that most people would singularly ignore as audio 'trash'. We hear the sounds and the machines that drive the technology come to life to create a remarkably musical experience.\n\n'There is no noise, only sound...'\nJohn Cage\n\n'The border between music and noise is always culturally defined.'\nJean-Jacques Nattiez\n\n'This musical evolution is paralleled by the multipication of machines, which collaborate with man on every front. Not only in the roaring atmosphere of major cities, but in the country too, which until yesterday was totally silent, the machine today has created such a variety and rivalry of noises that pure sound, in its exiguity and monotony, no longer arouses any feeling.'\nLuigi Russolo\n\nSubject results: 95 HD", "title": "'Pimp your ride'  Emotional machines 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-07-26T14:22:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3-XlTdrQDNo", "description": "This is fucking rock power", "title": "The New Christs \"You Have Landed\" Gruta 77 May 2008 Madrid", "publishedDate": "2008-05-28T22:54:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3-Y4_ZZjehQ", "description": "Painting video gallery artists centuries 15-19:Edvard Munch,\u042d\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041c\u0443\u043d\u043a,Emile Fabry,\n\u042d\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044c \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0424\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438,Marie-Clementine Valade,\u0421\u044e\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d.\nGallery-(79-100)", "title": "Gallery-(79-100)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-08T09:29:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3-Y5I4cfqyk", "description": "Jard\u00edn del Veneno, alberga a las plantas m\u00e1s mort\u00edferas del planeta. \n\n01 de abril 2014. \n\nJard\u00edn del Veneno en el Castillo de Alnwick, un lugar que alberga a las plantas m\u00e1s mort\u00edferas del planeta.\n\nPara m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n entra en http://www.cadenatres.com.mx\nNo olvides dejarnos tus comentarios y visitarnos en\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/CadenaTresMx\nTwitter https://twitter.com/cadenatres_mx\nSitio http://cadenatres.com.mx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJard\u00edn del Veneno,alberga a las plantas m\u00e1s mort\u00edferas del planeta,plantas m\u00e1s mort\u00edferas del planeta,mort\u00edferas del planeta,plantas mortales,castillo con plantas mortales,Poison Garden,home to the deadliest plants on the planet,deadliest plants on the planet,the planet deadly,deadly plants,plants with deadly castle,ultimas noticias", "title": "Jard\u00edn del Veneno, alberga a las plantas m\u00e1s mort\u00edferas del planeta", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T15:47:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3-YHHJS9NQo", "description": "Beatrice is a girl from one out of five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Candor, Amity, Dauntless.

As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, The Sickness Unto Death (1849) and The Myth of Sisyphus (1942):\n\nSuicide (or, \"escaping existence\"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd, but only becomes more absurd, to end one's own existence.\n\nReligious, spiritual, or abstract belief in a transcendent realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a \"leap of faith\"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as \"philosophical suicide\".\n\nAcceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve absolute freedom, and that by recognizing no religious or other moral constraints and by revolting against the Absurd while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could possibly be content from the personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as \"demoniac madness\": \"He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!\"\n\nCompare the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again.\n\n\"The struggle itself...is enough to fill a man's heart.

The genus name is for Willem Hendrik de Vriese, Dutch botanist, physician (1806--1862). Containing some of the largest bromeliad species, these tropical plants harbor a wide variety of insect fauna, unlike the smaller Catopsis species. In the wild, frogs may go through their whole life cycle in a bromeliad. This genus is closely related to Guzmania. Both Guzmania and Vriesea have dry capsules that split open to release parachute like seeds similar to the Dandelion. Most Vriesea are epiphytes and grow soil-less on trees. they have no roots but have special hold fasts that do not take in any nutrients. All nutrients are taken in through the center \"tank\" made by a rosette of leaves. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vriesea \n\nAn epiphyte is a plant that grows non-parasitically upon another plant (such as a tree), and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it instead of the structure it is fastened to. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is not called an epiphyte.  Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, and algae) or in the tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads). Epiphytes provide a rich and diverse habitat for other organisms including animals, fungi, bacteria, and myxomycetes. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyte\n\nBr\u00f6nugrasa\u00e6ttin, Orchidaceae, telur um 20 \u00fe\u00fas. tegundir v\u00ed\u00f0a um heim, a\u00f0allega \u00ed hitabelti og heittempru\u00f0um l\u00f6ndum.

More particularly but not limited to the ability to take the projectile and predictably have it stay solid in one medium but yet have the exact same projectile predictably react as a fragmenting bullet through a different medium without alteration of the projectile. The geometry at the tip of the projectile has much to do with the way the projectile travels through tissue. It has been long known in the medical industry that a trocar point penetrates the dermis layer more efficiently. Patents for trocars appeared early in the 19th century, although their use dated back possibly thousands of years. It is the use of this geometry at the front end of the projectile that does specific work at the point of entry from one system to the next. Dependent on the medium the projectiles geometry is designed to react differently.\n\nImagine a Hole saw. The hole saw action that occurs at points of entry into different mediums reduce initial drag which allow the hollow cavity in the center of the projectile to rapidly pack. In the case of plywood the hole saw action cleanly cuts and packs the projectile with a slug that makes it solid thus allowing it to conserve more of its energy. This performance could prove to be very effective for law enforcement that may be in a situation where the target is behind such an obstacle whereas more energy will be carried into the intended target and not lost in the obstacle.\n\nIn a fluid the projectile fragments. Due to the trocar geometry of each petal the resulting diameter of the fragmentation pattern is maximized. The trocar tips allow the fragments to swim through tissue / gel with less resistance thus conserving energy. The cross sectional thicknesses and geometries also create a full 180 degree flip halfway along each of the 8 petals path. The resulting shock wave and wound path is maximized. The result is devastating.\n\n\nThe G2 Research R.I.P. 9mm:\n* Up to 6\" diameter spread \n* 96 gr projectile \n* 2\" grouping at 25 yrds \n* 1265 FPS / 370 Muzzle Energy \n* 9 Separate Wound Channels

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors.

the lowest grading, officials have warned of the storm's damaging effects.\n\nJanet Napolitano, the US Homeland Security secretary, said a hurricane still remains a threat, regardless of its category.\n\n\"I would advise people not to focus that much on Category 1, 2 or 3 ... if you're in a hurricane, it's a big deal,\" Napolitano told a conference call.\n\n\"This remains a large and dangerous storm.\"\n\nPhone and electricity down\n\nMore than 600,000 people are without electricity along the east coast as power plants cut their supply to ensure the units can keep running if the storm affects other parts of the grid.\n\nThe hurricane is on track to careen up the east coast late Saturday and Sunday, passing over or near Washington, New York and Boston, a densely populated urban corridor home to some 65 million people.\n\nIn the port and holiday city of Wilmington, North Carolina, thousands of people were without electricity as Irene's winds intensified.\n\nThe streets were empty before dawn and the air was filled with the smell and sound of pine trees cracking under the advancing storm.\n\nIn summer weather, the area sees hundreds of thousands of residents and vacationers, but most have evacuated from Irene's path.\n\nSupermarkets and hardware stores, meanwhile, were inundated with people stocking up on food, water, flashlights, batteries, generators and other supplies.\n\n\"Our number of customers has tripled in the last day or two as people actually said 'Wow, this thing is going to happen',\" said Jack Gurnon, owner of a hardware store in the northeastern city of Boston.\n\nAirlines cancelled nearly 7,000 flights over the weekend and all three New York area airports were due to close to incoming flights at noon (1600 GMT) on Saturday.\n\nTens of thousands of people on the East Coast were on the move on Saturday, fleeing their homes and vacation spots ahead of the massive Irene.\n\nMore info on this please follow this link -

This is more specifically known as the \"absolute index of refraction\" for a particular medium.

The nutmeg tree is important for two spices derived from the fruit: nutmeg and mace.\n\nNutmeg is the seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to 1 in) long and 15 to 18 mm (0.6 to 0.7 in) wide, and weighing between 5 and 10 g (0.2 and 0.4 oz) dried, while mace is the dried \"lacy\" reddish covering or aril of the seed. The first harvest of nutmeg trees takes place 7--9 years after planting, and the trees reach full production after 20 years. Nutmeg is usually used in powdered form. This is the only tropical fruit that is the source of two different spices. Several other commercial products are also produced from the trees, including essential oils, extracted oleoresins, and nutmeg butter.\n\nThe common or fragrant nutmeg, Myristica fragrans, native to the Banda Islands of Indonesia, is also grown in Penang Island in Malaysia and the Caribbean, especially in Grenada. It also grows in Kerala, a state in southern India. Other species of nutmeg include Papuan nutmeg M. argentea from New Guinea, and Bombay nutmeg M. malabarica from India, called jaiphal in Hindi; both are used as adulterants of M. fragrans products.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

During the movie an electric field is switched on to reverse the order parameter and subsequently changed to restore the initial condition. The bottom signal represents the lateral torsion of the tip, i.e. the friction force. In the red phase the tip is unable to dissipate efficiently and the signal is noisy and chaotic, in the green phase the dissipation is larger and the signal is clean and periodic.

Reflex actions are very important as they save us from painful or dangerous stimuli. Reflexes are fast, immediate, automatic and involuntary responses of the body. Reflexes occur without our thinking. Brain is not involved in the execution of several reflexes. The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation that occurs involuntarily, i.e. without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvement of a part of the central nervous system is called reflex action.The structural and functional unit that carries out reflex action is called REFLEX ARC. Reflex arc consists of a receptor, a sensory nerve afferent, an association neuron, motor nerve (efferent) and effectors organ. The receptor may be a single cell or group of cells. They receive information about stimuli and generate electric potentials. The sensory nerve is associated with the receptor. It carries the information from the receptor organ to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, the sensory nerve makes connections with other neurons in the grey matter. These neurons are called inter neurons or association neurons. The neurons process the information and generate responses. The efferent fibers of motor nerves carry these responses from interneuron\u2019s to the effectors organ which is usually a muscle. This makes the muscle to contract. There are 2 types of reflexes: Unconditional Reflexes and Conditional Reflexes. Unconditional Reflexes: These are inborn reflexes. These reflexes are inherited and are shown from birth onwards. These reflexes are present in all individuals and animals and are basically same. They are not learnt. For example: no body taught us to withdraw our hand when we touch a hot object. Conditioned Reflexes: These are not inherited. It is learnt by doing the same act several times. Ivan Pavlov, a Russian scientist, did experiments on conditioned reflexes. His experiments on dogs have become very famous. It is known fact that when the dog sees food, it salivates. He rang a bell whenever the dog was given food. After doing this for few days, he noticed that dog starts salivating when it hears the bell even if the food is not given i.e. the dog associated the sound of the bell with the food and assumes that whenever the bell rings food is given. In expectation of food, saliva starts flowing from its mouth. For example, standing in attention when you hear National Anthem is a conditioned reflex.\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\nK-12.

Scavelli, Adam Siegel, Ronaldo Vasconcellos, Edgar Wright\nScreenwriter: Michael Bacall, Edgar Wright, Bryan Lee O'Malley\nFilm Description: Based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's Oni Press comic book of the same name, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World follows the eponymous slacker rocker on his colorful quest to defeat his dream girl's seven evil ex-boyfriends. Twenty-two-year-old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) may not have a job, but rocking the bass for his band, Sex Bob-omb, is a tough job unto itself. When Scott locks eyes with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he knows she's the girl he wants to grow old with. But Ramona has some serious baggage; her supercharged exes rue the thought of her being with another man, and they'll crush any guy who gives her a second glance. Now, in order to win Ramona's heart, Scott will do battle with everyone from vegan-powered rock gods to sinister skateboarders, never losing sight of his gorgeous goal as he pummels his way to victory. Shaun of the Dead's Edgar Wright directs the film from a script he penned with Michael Bacall. Superhero veterans Chris Evans and Brandon Routh co-star in the action comedy as two of the seven ex-boyfriends.\n\n\"scott pilgrim vs. the world\",\"michael cera\",\"jason schwartzman\",\"mary elizabeth winstead\",\"ellen wong\",\"sword videos\",\"weapons videos\",\"action adventure\",\"action comedies\",\"comic books and superheroes\",\"martial arts\",\"marc e platt\",\"ronaldo vasconcellos\",\"adam siegel\",\"nira park\",\"j miles dale\",\"jared leboff\",\"eric gitter\",\"lisa gitter\",\"edgar wright\",\"joe nozemack\",\"steven v scavelli\",\"betrayal videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++446336,/m/03q3sy,/m/02qfhb,/m/073x6y,/m/0b3vvq6", "title": "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (8/10) Movie CLIP - Knives vs. Ramona (2010) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-02T00:58:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "30iVSISCwTE", "description": "Subscribe to our channel for future videos.\nFor more music - http://artemia.bandcamp.com/music\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/artemiamusic\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/@artemiaband\n\nSnowed In was recorded by Eric Rinker [drum tracking at Green Light Sound Studios, Augusta, GA].

Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency over her young son with Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control and established near-absolute rule over the dynasty. She installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor in 1875. A conservative ruler who refused to adopt Western models of government, Cixi rejected reformist views and placed Guangxu under house arrest in later years for supporting reformers.

Several said they had been trying to get to New Zealand to find jobs.\nThe group appeared in a court in the town of Galle on Tuesday charged with illegally leaving the country, after spending the night in a Sri Lankan high-security detention centre upon their return.\nWhile the children were discharged, the rest of the group face an initial charge of breaking immigration law, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail.\nMost are members of Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese community rather than minority Tamils -- some of whose members have suffered persecution since the end in 2009 of a decades-long separatist war.\nAustralia has come under fire over the transfer, with experts saying its shipboard screening to determine whether the migrants had refugee status appeared inadequate under international law.\nMorrison declined comment on the fate of another 153 Sri Lankans being held in custody on the high seas, saying the matter was still before the courts.\nAustralia faces growing pressure over its immigration policies with high court action under way over the 153, who are currently detained on a customs boat.\nLawyers argue that any transfer back to Colombo would be illegal, with concerns about the way they were screened.\nA Sri Lankan navy source said Colombo may not accept back the group because their boat was thought to have left for Australia from southern India, close to Sri Lanka.\n\"Our information is that the boat with 153 people had left Indian shores and we are not sure (of) the identity of the people onboard,\" the source said, asking not to be named.\n\"That is why we don't want to take them back like the group of 41 people who had set out from our east coast.\"\nMorrison said Australia and Sri Lanka were working closely to stop people smuggling.\n\"The recent return of a group of 41 Sri Lankan nationals who attempted to arrive illegally by boat to Australia serves as a testament to this relationship,\" Morrison said in a statement after the ceremony.\nAustralia's conservative prime minister Tony Abbott came to power in September vowing to stop the flood of asylum-seekers arriving on rickety boats, mainly from southeast Asia, with hundreds of people dying en route.\nMorrison told reporters Australia's illegal immigration policy was successful and no people-smuggling boats had arrived for nearly seven months.", "title": "Australia rejects Sri Lankan migrant mistreatment claim", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T07:56:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "30m54CkyIKo", "description": "http://musicfog.com Ray Wylie Hubbard & Rick Richards appearing on the Music Fog stage during our music marathon.

I'm going to go over five basic fundamentals that you should know for indoor rock climbing.\n\nOne of the first fundamentals is just general body awareness and being able to identify your center of gravity. You want to use that to be able to keep your weight in balance, which would be the second fundamental, learning how to balance and shift your weight. And once you've identified that center of gravity, keeping that weight over your feet, so you're going to be pushing with your legs, rather than pulling with your arms, which brings us to the next fundamental, of climbing with straight arms.\n\nUsing this position is much more beneficial as far as the efficiency of your movement goes. Right now, with my arms straight, I'm not taking any energy to pull myself in. You can see my left leg is bent here, so as I initiate this movement up, I'll be pushing rather than pulling. That allows for much more efficient motion. \n\nWe also have two other basic fundamental techniques, known as edging and flagging. Edging is when you're using your climbing shoes to basically be edging on a hold. So, I can use both the inside edge and the outside edge of my climbing shoes. Both should be applied frequently to change your body position and help you move in balance. \n\nFor example, I can use the outside edge of my right foot here to keep my right hip close to the wall, so that as I move up, that center of gravity is going to stay over my let, allowing me to push, rather than pull. I've also grabbed that next hold with a straight arm, rather than with a bent arm, saving me a little bit of energy.\n\nFlagging is a technique that's fundamental, once again, for keeping your balance. Flagging comes in handy when all of the holds are on the same side of your body. Right now, to stay in balance, it'd be a little tricky for me to move without having my body kind of swing around a little bit, which is a big waste of energy.

It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.\n\nBitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.\n\nBitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Bitcoin can be used to pay online and in physical stores just like any other form of money. Bitcoins can also be exchanged in physical form such as the Casascius coins, but paying with a mobile phone usually remains more convenient. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual.\n\nThe total number of bitcoins that can be mined has been preset at 21 million, whereas the amount of gold that can be mined is a more complicated question. Over time, the increase in the supply of gold has increased at roughly 1-3% per year, but on a short-term basis there can conceivably be a lot of volatility in the price of gold due to new discoveries. Of course, as a new technology, bitcoin is subject to much more volatility than gold. But over the long run, given the fact that no new bitcoins will be mined after the 21-millionth, we can expect it to ultimately serve as a better store of value than gold.\n\n\"With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.\"\nSatoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin Developer\n\n\"There are 3 eras of currency: Commodity based, politically based, and now, math based.\"\nChris Dixon, Technology Investor\n\n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/\nhttps://www.weusecoins.com/en/\nhttps://coinbase.com/\nhttp://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/19/gold-bitcoin/", "title": "Bitcoin vs Gold: How I Believe That Bitcoin Has Intrinsic Value Like Gold", "publishedDate": "2014-04-24T07:10:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "31QZ6jnKZTU", "description": "Modded Singular Bomb and added Insane Thermobaric explosion!\n\nVisit us on #factionfiles @ irc.gamesurge.net for more!!", "title": "Red Faction: Guerrilla - Singularity Bomb + Thermobaric Explosion Mod", "publishedDate": "2009-09-21T03:47:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "31Q_sTRvLW0", "description": "This tutorial from The Potomac Bead Company shows you how to use a diamond tipped bead reamer for enlarging holes in beads.

The pharaoh ruled in 2500 BC and oversaw the construction of one of the three Giza pyramids, where he was enshrined.\n\n\"Once in a lifetime you find something like this,\" says Amnon Ben-Tor, the director of the excavation and a professor at Hebrew University, which sponsors the archeological digging.\n\n\"This is of extreme importance from many points of view, since it is the only sphinx of this king known in the world -- even in Egypt. It is also the only monumental piece of Egyptian sculpture found anywhere in the Levant,\" he said, referring to the region spanning the east of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBen-Tor says the sphinx was deliberately broken, as were about 10 other Egyptian statues that had been previously found there. When cities fell, he said, most statues had their heads and hands cut off.\n\n\"This is what happened to this one here. He lost his hands,\" Ben-Tor said. The full sphinx is estimated to have been a meter tall, weighing half a ton.\n\nThe team will continue to search for the rest of its body on the archeological site covering 200 acres -- even if it takes 600 years, the length of time Ben-Tor expects for the site to be fully excavated.\n\nAs for the biggest question of all -- how the sphinx got to Tel Hazor -- it will likely remain a mystery.\n\n\"Maybe this was a gift which the Egyptian king sent to the local king of Hazor. Maybe. To prove it? Impossible,\" Ben-Tor said.\n\nTel Hazor was the capital of the city of Canaan 4,000 years ago, its population reaching 20,000. Located on the route connecting Egypt and Babylon, the city prospered.\n\nExcavations first began in the 1950s, and it is now recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nDuring most of the year, this remote part of Israel is quiet. But every summer, archeologists, students and volunteers descend on Tel Hazor to uncover how the ancients lived. The site has become important for biblical archeology, which aims to illuminate events in the Bible.\n\n\nDARK MATTER PARADIGM | http://darkmatterparadigm.blogspot.com/\n\nThe mystery and history of the first peoples - The Indigenous, Original Moors.

The 6 ft x 6 ft sidewalk slab at our front stoop had sunk on one end to a 10-1/2 inch  step.  It caused people to trip stepping up, and to stumble stepping down.  I didn't want to spend $350 to $400 so I thought up ways to lift the slab and what to put under it.  I decided to use heavy-duty C-clamps, a 10 ft. long 4x4 post, and scissor jacks to raise it.   And then insert Owens-Corning Foamular high-density foam under the raised slab (from Home Depot or similar store).  This stuff is great.   It took me about 2 hours once I assembled the tools.   Be sure when you buy good hardware store C-clamps that are heavy duty, not those from Harbor Freight or a 'Made In China' tool store.  A friend who owns apartment buildings had a slab-jacking company pump in expanding foam.  He told me that foam does not last.  But this Foamular is actually designed to be installed under concrete.  It is used in new construction to insulate walls and floors!   Don't try this yourself unless you have proper equipment and take safety precautions. Raise slab HIGH ENOUGH to slide in the foam in manageable pieces.  No need to cover the entire area beneath the slab with foam - covering about 1/2 of the area or more will be enough.  And NEVER put hands under the slab.

The Enphase System now includes an M250 microinverter that produces 250-Watts peak AC output power and MyEnlighten, an intuitive, web-based solar monitoring solution designed for system owners.\n\nEnphase microinverters have revolutionized solar power generation, leading Enphase Energy to be named the number one residential PV inverter supplier in the Americas, according to industry data published yesterday by IHS Research in its PV Inverter World Market Report - 2013.\n\"We're excited to introduce our fourth generation microinverter system and proud of our achievement of being named the leading PV inverter vendor in the Americas by IHS Research,\" said Paul Nahi, CEO of Enphase Energy. \"With the improved M250 and new Enlighten, we expect to continue to set the bar for performance, reliability and ease-of-use and installation in our industry.\"\nEnphase M250 Microinverter: Optimized for high-power solar modules, the M250 microinverter produces 250-Watts peak AC output power and pairs with 60-cell modules up to 300W STC. The M250 is rated at 96.5 percent CEC weighted efficiency, the highest efficiency in the industry for microinverters. In addition, the M250 has been built to withstand the most grueling environmental conditions. It is NEMA 6 rated and has undergone over one million hours of testing in extreme temperature and humidity environments prior to launch. The new Enphase System continues to be supported by an industry-leading 25-year warranty.\nThe M250 also supports a new integrated ground feature, again a first in the industry for microinverters. Because the M250 microinverter's DC circuit is isolated and insulated from ground, it eliminates need for a separate copper Grounding Electrode Conductor (GEC) to each microinverter. This improvement allows for faster installation time and lower materials costs.\nEnlighten Software Platform: Enlighten is an intelligent web-based monitoring software platform that provides solar professionals and system owners with ongoing operations and uptime assurance. It now comes available in two different versions.\nFor solar professionals, Enlighten Manager offers web based tools to monitor and manage multiple installations, streamlining the operations and maintenance processes. Solar professionals can view detailed performance data from a fleet of PV installations, compare actual system performance data against modeled performance, remotely diagnose and resolve issues impacting system performance and access performance data for PV module warranty claims.\nFor solar energy system owners, MyEnlighten offers an engaging interface to view and share energy production and environmental benefits of their solar arrays. From any device with an Internet connection, system owners can access at-a-glance views of energy production, compare current performance against a previous day, week or month, view historical weather data to understand variations in performance and share performance data with friends and colleagues through integrated social media buttons.\nEnvoy Communications Gateway: The Envoy Communications Gateway connects the solar array with network access, enabling comprehensive monitoring and management of an Enphase installation. The latest Envoy supports up to 500 microinverters. This means a single Envoy can support a residential or small commercial system up to 100kW, and multiple Envoys can be used for larger system sizes. In addition, powerline communications has been enhanced to provide greater noise immunity, longer range and higher performance resulting in improved connectivity between Envoy and the solar array.", "title": "The NEW Enphase M250 Micro Inverter Features and How to Install Guide | RENVU.com", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T20:17:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "32C4QAKce7M", "description": "Always pushing their artistic experimentation to the max, the duo has created two versions of their new video for \"Stumble\" which is a perfect introduction to the world of Bonjay with its chopped up sirens, irresistible beat, and a voice from singer Alanna Stuart that is as commanding as it is seductive.

Esto es el resultado de muchos a\u00f1os de trabajo y perseverancia para lograr la certificaci\u00f3n para ser un hospital donde se realicen estos trasplantes\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Posse. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGaleano y Goncalves antes de la operaci\u00f3n en el Hospital Central de San Isidro\n\n \n\nTras la operaci\u00f3n, Nora Bruno, Jefa del servicio de Oftalmolog\u00eda, expres\u00f3: \u201cHoy es un d\u00eda de mucha felicidad para todo el Hospital. Se trata de una cirug\u00eda poco frecuente en hospitales p\u00fablicos. El paciente va a recuperar su visi\u00f3n\u201d. \n\n \n\nBruno coment\u00f3 que el paciente ten\u00eda una lesi\u00f3n en la cornea que se llama \u201cmeeting corneal\u201d, un adelgazamiento progresivo de la c\u00f3rnea, que estaba calcificada por lo que el paciente estaba ciego. \n\n \n\n\u201cLa c\u00f3rnea que lleg\u00f3 desde el INCUCAI era muy buena y trasparente, el donante era un chico de 18 a\u00f1os. Por eso, agradecemos a toda la gente que dona sus c\u00f3rneas, enfatiz\u00f3 la m\u00e9dica. \n\n \n\nAl frente de la operaci\u00f3n estuvo el m\u00e9dico oftalm\u00f3logo y cirujano, Pedro Piantoni, quien expres\u00f3: \u201cEl procedimiento sali\u00f3 bien. Durante la operaci\u00f3n, que dur\u00f3 52 minutos, no hubo complicaciones. Soy muy optimista con el resultado que vamos a obtener. De a poco el vecino ir\u00e1 recuperando la agudeza visual y empezar\u00e1 a ver sin ning\u00fan inconveniente\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el trasplante de c\u00f3rnea?\n\n \n\nLa jefa del Departamento de Oftalmolog\u00eda, Nora Bruno, explic\u00f3 que la c\u00f3rnea es la parte anterior del ojo, se trata de un tejido sensible transparente que nos permite ver. El trasplante significa el cambio de una c\u00f3rnea alterada por otra sana. \u201cEsta operaci\u00f3n puede realizarse gracias a personas que antes de morir donan sus c\u00f3rneas\u201d, resalt\u00f3 Bruno.\n\n \n\nHabilitaci\u00f3n, un logro del Hospital Central\n\n \n\nEn mayo del a\u00f1o pasado, el Ministerio de Salud de la Provincia de Buenos Aires habilit\u00f3 al Hospital Central de San Isidro \u201cDr. Melchor \u00c1ngel Posse\u201d para realizar trasplantes de c\u00f3rnea y dem\u00e1s tejidos constitutivos del ojo en pacientes adultos.

I've wheeled them in mud, water, rocks and snow.\n\nThe tread pattern makes the tire a good compromise between an all-terrain and mud tire (but don't mistake it for a heavy duty mud tire). The tire has many handy features. Ample siping allows for excellent traction on wet roads and loose rock. Little claws in the tread valley give traction in deep snow, mud, and sand. The tires are pinned for metal snow studs and feature moderate rim protection.\n\nThe Duratrac is fairly light as well, weighing in at less than 60 lbs. Note that the tire measures 34 \u00bc\" tall, not 35. They look aggressive and have tame road manners. Minimal road noise and confident handling have been my experience (once a fuel tanker cut me off and I slammed on my brakes... the tires didn't break traction).\n\n15,000 miles and 15 wheeling trips in and they're starting to wear. Original tread depth was \u00bd\"; I've lost 1/8\" and the tread blocks are starting to round off. Here's a new tire compared to my used tires. They can chunk easily if you spin them on rocks.\n\nSidewall thickness has been a complaint with these tires. My only flat was a sidewall slash from abusive wheeling.\n\nOverall I'm incredibly happy with these tires. They give me confidence on the road and trail and have become a very popular tire for this reason. \n\nThis was a BerserkerOffroad.com review of Goodyear's Wrangler Duratrac tire.", "title": "Goodyear Duratrac Tire Review After 15,000 Miles", "publishedDate": "2013-08-23T10:26:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "32S9tPtKiIo", "description": "Reviewing the Competency Profile for a postition is an important step in the performance planning stage.\n(Video 2)", "title": "Stage 1:  Competency Profiles and Proficiency Levels", "publishedDate": "2010-04-15T14:22:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "32SeIV_DEWk", "description": "First official music video from the self titled EP \"Gunfire-N-Sodomy\"\n\nBuy on iTunes now: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/gunfire-n-s****y-ep/id661333153\n\nhttp://gunfirensodomy.com/\n\nDirected/Edited by Raffi Asdourian:  http://zaffi.com/", "title": "Gunfire-N-Sodomy- Official LIVE \"Rape Your Face\" Video", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T22:17:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "32Slnv-CX-k", "description": "\u00a1Important Note! : The Lire has been demonetized and replaced with the Euro.\nDemonetized : February 28, 2002\n\n\n\u00a0Italian Republic (Repubblica italiana)\n200 Lire from 1978\n\u00a0\nOrigin : Repubblica \u00a0Italiana ( Italian Republic in English) or Italy\u00a0\nOther Names :\nFace Value : 200 lire ( Can not be determent to the value of a dollar )\nMass :\u00a05 grams\nShape :  Round\nDiameter :\u00a024 mm\nThickness : 1.64 mm\nEdge : Reeded\nComposition :\u00a0Aluminium-bronze\nIssued : 1978\nMint : Rome\nMintage : 461,034,000\nNumismatic Value : ???\nObverse : A head looking at the right.\nGoing around the outside of the head the lettering \"Repvbblica Italiana\"\nand \"M.Vallucci\"[Designer -\u00a0Mario Vallucci]\nReverse : A gear and within is the value of the coin which is \"200 LIRE\".

And some women don't help matters much, in that regard.  \n\nWay back in 1983, a group called Daniel Amos was in the midst of a four-album story arc - The \u00a1ALARMA! Chronicles - which spoke the the hollowness of many aspects of Western culture, and how a relationship with Christ (though not necessarily \"religion\") could make a difference.  In addition to scripture, they drew inspiration from such diverse wells as T. S. Eliot, Czeslaw Milosz, Annie Dillard, Ron Sider, Pinocchio, cheesy Sci-Fi films, and home hair-care products.\n\n\"Real Girls\" is a song from their second album in the Chronicles arc,\"Doppelg\u00e4nger.\"  It follows the song \"Mall (All Over the World)\", where commercialism has run amok, and mannequins take the stage left and right.  It poses the question: \"Who are the Real Girls?\"  It's a harder question than you might think!\n\nThe song is also a reflection of sorts on what liberation, for women, really means.\n\nIn an interview, song author Terry Taylor, reflected: \"I think it's a Christian assessment of the whole idea of women's liberation; what really that liberation consists of, what true liberation is - a song that first scared me... Yes we agree that women have been hung in the meat market for a long time and displayed and put on television shows and been in many, many ways subverted by men, and now we are calling for that liberation, but we are calling for that Godliness, the woman of virtue, the woman who knows her position in Christ.  And man's heart is being changed again also by God so that his view of what a woman is is changed as well\".\n\nIs this too nuanced a view for our current culture?  Is there still room for virtue amidst the Scylla and Charybdis of exploitation and freedom?\n\nThis version of the song is a cover by Joy Gewalt (formerly of The Throes), from the Daniel Amos tribute album \"When Worlds Collide\".  I find it even more powerful than the original.  Partly because it's a bit less dated musically, but largely I think because having it interpreted through the heart and mind of a woman makes it more immediate and personal.  And the \"Real Grrrls Orchestra\" is an electrifying addition.\n\nSurprisingly, despite the relative obscurity, the tribute album that this comes from still seems to be available from DA's website, @ http://www.danielamos.com/store/ - and the song itself is available on amazon @ http://www.amazon.com/Real-Girls/dp/B004RR54OY \n\nThe images I incorporated in the video are just downloads from Google image searches to find stuff of relevance.  \n\nI claim no rights to any of this stuff, they belong to the original authors/artists/labels. If anyone owns the rights to something and would like it removed, just ask!\n\nAn RJFVideoUpload Production, November 25, 2012\n\n\n\nLYRICS:  Real Girls. from the album \"Doppelg\u00e4nger\"\nWords and Music by Terry Taylor and Jerry Chamberlain\n\u00a91983 Twitchen Vibes/ Paragon Music Corp.

The North and South American Committees of the AOU and the IOC have voted on or before July 2011 to split the American forms into a new species Common Gallinule, however, no other committee has voted to change taxonomy yet. In that light, the American forms can now be found under a separate species listing Common Gallinule,[1] however all forms can still be found here until further actions are taken.

This form was previously referred to as \"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"juvenile diabetes\".\nType 2 DM results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. This form was previously referred to as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\".\nThe third main form, gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. It may precede development of type 2 DM.\n\nWhat is cellulitis?\nCellulitis is a skin infection caused by bacteria. Normally, your skin helps protect you from infection. But if you have a cut, sore, or insect bite, bacteria can get into the skin and spread to deeper tissues. If it is not treated with antibiotics, the infection can spread to the blood or lymph nodes. This can be deadly.\n\nSome people can get cellulitis without having a break in the skin. These include older adults and people who have diabetes or a weak immune system. These people are also more likely to develop dangerous problems from cellulitis. And they are more likely to get cellulitis again.\n\n\nLymphedema- also known as lymphatic obstruction, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system returns the interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct and then to the bloodstream, where it is recirculated back to the tissues. Tissues with lymphedema are at risk of infection.", "title": "CAN I BE FREE", "publishedDate": "2013-05-05T12:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "32bbV_yXJ4I", "description": "Tiwi, Albay", "title": "Pottery Making in Albay - Carving", "publishedDate": "2009-05-23T02:46:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "32bhVhm2TKE", "description": "Torex Cough Syrup Jagjit Singh & Om Puri Oriya 25 sec Video Commercial By Torque Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd (India)\nDiphenhyramine is an antihistamine that relieves congestion and post-nasal drips.

Although not very well known today, except among a growing group of followers, the pawpaw deserves more respect than it gets. Let's start with the flavor of its fruit, which can be described as an intense banana pudding with a hint of mango flavor. The fruit flavor comes as a surprise considering the leaves smell of bell pepper or diesel fuel when crushed, which keeps the foliage relatively pest free. Even if these fruits didn't taste like a dream, the health benefits far outweigh the flavor experience. Pawpaw is extremely high in Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, amino acids, and several vitamins. It is also being studied intensively for its already proven anti-cancer and insecticidal qualities. \n \nWe collect our fruit every year in late August, just before they ripen and fall to the ground when hungry deer, coons, possums, hogs, and you-name-it are waiting to steal our crop. Many of our fruits are quite large (up to 4 or 5\" in length) and contain fewer seeds, which is a good thing considering paw paws seem to inherit traits from their parents more often than not. \n \nPaw paws prefer your best soil with good drainage and protection from wind, so try and be picky when choosing a site for planting. A good starting point would be about twenty feet away from a treeline in a bottom field. Cedars or other fruit trees make an excellent windbreak, just be sure and plant your paw paws at least twenty feet from your break to deter its roots from robbing the soil moisture. A good spacing would be ten foot by at least ten foot.

It was one of the first recording labels to specialise in releasing music from the cinema on to record. Most of the score for \"Pieces\" consists of Stelvio Ciprianis score for \"Un Ombra Nell Ombra\" aka. \"Ring of Darkness\" (1979) and Carlo Maria Cordio's score for \"Absurd\" (1981). These soundtracks are released by CAM. But there are other songs used in \"Pieces\", that are not to be found on these soundtracks. These are most probably taken from other scores released by CAM.

With the explosion of modern sportswear in the 1920s, the novelty of the open-necked sport shirt inspired a variety of new ways to appoint the neck. Long a popular fashion at European watering holes, the sports scraf was, an still is, closely identified with Riviera high style. As international travel accelerate the adoption of lightweight sportswear, it wasn't long before the new \"tour de cou\" began turning up around the necks of smartly turned out Americans from the south of France to the Caribbean stylish strongholds.\n \nTwo basic models of sport neck-wear began taking shape. The more common was the neckerchief, a solid color or patterned square of silk, cotton, or other material that was knotted or draped in ascot fashion around the neck. At one point in the mid thirties, other than for a formal wear layout, every Hollywood head shot of male seemed to feature one version or another of these casual neck-scarves.How to tie your neckerchief like a gentleman by Christopher Plummer", "title": "Christopher Plummer \"How to tie a Neckerchief\"", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T18:27:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "32jKLS6hZaw", "description": "Time Lapse of me modeling a dome stage in Metasequoia, then later editing it in PMD to install the bones needed to rotate the dome.

It was to be her first-ever time rafting.  This clip shows the first rapids of the day, a class 5 rapid called Exterminator.  I'm in the left front of the raft, and she is directly behind me .... for the first few seconds, anyway.  After we went through the Exterminator \"stopper hole\" (the very beginning of the clip, when the raft briefly disappears), the 3 people behind me, including my friend, went \"swimming\".  She can be seen in closeup, furthest away from the raft, floating backwards into another stopperhole.  Phred, our guide, throws out two rescue lines, neither of which reached her ... one did however reach the wife of the guy in the right rear of the raft.  He comes up to my corner of the raft and he and I come very close to getting his wife back in the raft, each having one hand under each of her armpits, trying to pull her back in.  Then I feel something crushing my right ribcage, and the next thing I know, I'm pulled into the river and am breathing in water.  Phred's 2nd rescue line had gotten caught on something upstream, and as it's slack was tightening, it found it's way around the right side of my body, then proceeded to twist the raft around, using my body as it's torque point.  Then we see me and the other guy in the water also (I'm the one on the right). The raft then stops moving, followed by Phred reaching behind the raft to cut the rope .... this is how we knew it had gotten caught upstream.  A month later I was still having abdominal pain, and x-rays revealed that I'd fractured 2 ribs in this incident.", "title": "Whitewater rafting carnage on the Penobscot River", "publishedDate": "2006-09-26T18:52:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "32lL4L1nxnU", "description": "Samsung Gear VR is a fancy accessory for the brand new Galaxy Note 4 that brings wireless virtual reality...to reality.
