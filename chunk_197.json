Setelah sempat menguat, rupiah kembali melemah pagi ini. Pada pembukaan perdagangan hari ini, rupiah ditransaksikan pada posisi Rp 11 ribu per dolar Amerika Serikat dan terus berfluktuasi.\n\nPagi ini rupiah ditransaksikan di kisaran Rp 11.100/dolar AS. Rupiah tidak mampu menahan penguatan dolar di tengah sentimen kuat dari Amerika. Hari ini 4 November, Amerika akan menyelenggarakan hajatan besar pemilihan presiden. Para pelaku pasar mengantisipasi Pilpres AS, sehingga membuat permintaan dolar menguat.\n\nDari dalam negeri, pergerakan rupiah dipengaruhi ekspektasi sebagian pasar yang melihat penurunan inflasi bisa memicu Bank Indonesia menurunkan bunga acuan BI Rate. Hari ini rupiah diprediksi bergerak di rentang Rp 10.600 hingga Rp 11.300 per dolar AS.\n\nEuro dan yen Jepang juga melemah tipis terhadap dolar AS menyusul indikasi masuknya kawasan Uni Eropa ke dalam resesi. Euro melemah 15 poin. Investor memilih melepas euro dan kembali memegang dolar AS menjelang pertemuan Bank Sentral Eropa dan Bank Sentral Inggris, Kamis lusa, yang diperkirakan kembali menurunkan suku bunga.\n\nSementara itu yen Jepang tidak berhasil mempertahankan penguatannya dan melemah 19 poin terhadap dolar AS. Walaupun demikian, diperkirakan yen kembali menguat dan bertahan di bawah level 100 yen per dolar AS menyusul semakin banyaknya eksportir Jepang yang menukar yen mereka ke dolar AS untuk merealisasikan profitnya.\n\nDi bagian lain, seluruh mata uang negara di kawasan Asia Pasifik menguat tipis terhadap dolar AS pagi ini. Dolar Singapura, baht Thailand dan peso Filipina, seluruhnya menguat masing-masing 51,4 dan 35 poin pada pembukaan perdagangan pagi ini.

Every week some 3,500,000 young people, mostly young women, are infected with an STI (excluding HIV), and globally, one in five women will experience sexual violence in her lifetime. \n\nWhile progress has been made, South Sudan has some of the worst reproductive and maternal health statistics in the world. A maternal mortality ratio of 2,054 per 100,000 live births means approximately one out of every 50 births results in the death of a mother. This has further ramifications, as evidence shows that infants who lose their mothers are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.\n\nAcross the Pacific more than 50 percent of people are under the age of 25 - a section of the population which suffers a disproportionate burden of poor sexual and reproductive health, ranging from STIs to teenage pregnancies. And young adolescents face a higher risk of complications and death as a result of pregnancy than older women.\n\nHow do we help protect women's right to health in these contexts? What progress have we seen against Millennium Development Goal 5, and what gaps remain? How can health systems in developing countries meet the reproductive health needs of their populations, and achieve greater health equality for women and girls?\n\nTo discuss these issues and more, we are joined by Dr Samson Baba, Director General of Community and Public Health in South Sudan, the Hon Dr Meredith Burgmann, President of the Australian Council For International Development (ACFID) and Michele Rumsey, Director of Operations and Development at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Development, Faculty of Health at UTS.\n\nThis event is part of the Praxis Discussion Series 2013, connecting to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. \nRecorded\nFriday, August 9th\n\nModerator\nAuskar Surbakti, Journalist, ABC", "title": "Praxis Discussion Series: Maternal and Reproductive Health (short version)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-09T21:41:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQcxPyZwGTU", "description": "Every day of spring break, the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum offered Native American art demonstrations in conjunction with the exhibitions \"Pueblo to Pueblo: The Legacy of Southwest Indian Pottery\" and \"The Sun and His Wife.\" March 22nd's guest artist was Molly Murphy-Adams (Oglala) who demonstrated bead-making.

Six sensors are placed on the study participant's arms, legs and chest. As the person walks, or performs other functional activities, the sensors relate information to each other and back to a computer that charts how and where the person is moving.\n\n\"The nice thing about this technology is we can measure their balance and walking anywhere,\" said Page. \"We can have someone go up steps or perform household tasks, such as in a kitchen. Anywhere that walking or balance is important is a place we can capture how well the person is moving.\"\n\nPage is using this technology to evaluate progress in a study that is testing a new type of rehabilitation intervention for stroke survivors. For the first time, Page's team is combining electrical muscle stimulation, which has been used to improve muscle function for decades, with active stepping motion on a recumbent bicycle. The goal of the study is to determine whether the combination of active motion and electrical stimulation provides added benefit for the patient through neuroplasticity, or retraining the brain.\n\n\"The stepping motion on a recumbent bike uses similar parts of the brain as when a person is actually walking,\" said Page. \"We are trying to recruit new areas of the brain, around the stroke-damaged areas, which is called 'neuroplasticity,' and get those areas to hopefully control walking again.\"\n\nThe first part of this study will examine ten people who experienced a stroke within a year to 18 months prior to study enrollment and have limited ability to walk. Over the course of ten weeks, half of the study participants will receive electrical stimulation on their legs while biking, while the other half receives placebo treatment while biking.\n\nPage says this study challenges the notion among many physicians and rehabilitation experts that stroke survivors reach a recovery plateau within a year after their stroke.\n\n\"We have shown in more than a decade of studies that this belief is not true, and we expect to show that with this intervention. Stroke survivors can continue to get better and see meaningful gains years after their stroke,\" said Page.\n\nFor more information about this and other stroke rehabilitation studies, call 614-292-5490 or email Stephen.Page@osumc.edu.", "title": "SMART PHONE TECHNOLOGY TESTED IN STROKE REHAB", "publishedDate": "2013-04-02T19:56:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR2IH7BGRt4", "description": "J'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette vid\u00e9o \u00e0 l'aide de l'application de montage de vid\u00e9os YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/editor).", "title": "xnxx\"Aletta Ocean Hot Fuck Massage\"", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T20:41:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR2If0DtMHw", "description": "Equine ultrasound treatment of sesamoiditis performed with EQultrasound therapy device.\n\nwww.equltrasound.com", "title": "Horse sesamoiditis - equine ultrasound therapy", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T14:02:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR2wyyjGYiI", "description": "Petrified Forest, Near Gallup, NM", "title": "Petrified Forest", "publishedDate": "2009-06-03T20:42:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR3dDO1Sz0E", "description": "http://www.axislabs.net/pure-micronized-creatine-monohydrate.html Creatine is a natural compound made in the body and is derived from the diet through meat products. In the body, Creatine is changed into a molecule called phosphocreatine which serves as a storage reservoir for regenerating ATP. ATP is the chemical source of energy for muscle contraction and quick energy. Phosphocreatine is an important source of ATP energy in muscle tissue and studies have shown that Creatine can increase the performance of athletes in activities that require quick bursts of energy, such as sprinting and weight lifting. Creatine supplementation combined with strength training has been shown to cause dramatic improvements in muscle hypertrophy (size) and strength through cell volumization and increased protein synthesis.

The small hydro power unit comprises a reservoir (410), a pumping device, a waterway, a power generation waterwheel, a generator, a centrifugal force wheel, and a starting motor. The pumping device pumps water in the reservoir using electric energy which is transmitted from the charging unit. The waterway guides the water in the reservoir from a high place to a low place using the pumping device. The power generation waterwheel is connected to the waterway in order to rotate using head energy of the flowing water. The generator converts rotational energy of the of the power generation waterwheel into electric energy. The centrifugal force wheel is connected by the power generation waterwheel and a first belt, is connected by the generator and a second belt, and controls revolutions per minute (RPM) of the power generation waterwheel and the generator using the electric energy which is transmitted from the charging unit.\nTraditionally large dams have been constructed in order to implement hydroelectric power. The dam serves to organize the flowing water and increase the pressure or head for use in a hydroelectric turbine. Unfortunately, dams and associated reservoirs submerge land upstream of the dams. The submersion land can destroy biologically productive riparian habitats like river valley forests, marshland, and grasslands. The loss of land is compounded by habitat fragmentation. Further, large dams can become a hazard with the potential to inflict tremendous damage and loss of life should the dam ever fail.\nIncreasingly, nations are preventing the construction of new dams and seeking power capture in low head situations like canals, tidal flows, small dams, or natural river flows. In low head situations the pressure is low and power must be extracted from the natural velocity or kinetic energy of the water. Unlike with high head situations, the maximum possible extractable power in low head situations is often too low to justify costly turbine blades. Despite the need for systems that can generate power using low head situations, many attempts have proven impractical or too costly.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nImplementations of the present invention provide water wheel (undershot / overshot / side shot) and apparatus configured to convert kinetic energy of lower head flowing water into power. In particular, one or more implementations of the present invention include a hydro-kinetic power generation system including Zero/low head hydro turbine/wheel with in-buckets Coanda enhancers subsystem.. Additionally, implementations of the present invention can be easily configured for a variety of installations.\n\nFor more details call us at: +359 897872857\nAuthor, Inventor, designer and patent holder George Tonchev Ph.D.\nhttp://newcreator.biz \nhttp://solextra.net \nhttp://tonchev.net \nhttp://starton.biz \nhttp://b2b.bg \nhttp://tonchev.org \nhttp://greenclips.eu", "title": "World novelty  - zero head water wheel with in-scoops Coanda enhancers", "publishedDate": "2014-03-26T18:04:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR3towzmP4Y", "description": "Apodemus flavicollis briefly kept for observation after being caught in life-trap at Exloo, the Netherlands", "title": "Grote bosmuis Exloo 2012", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T00:57:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR3yNrQu9hs", "description": "Blue:\nKCLO 3/ 4 - 60%\nCuO - 15%\nPVC - 10%\nS - 10%\nDextrin - 5%\n\nYellow microstar:\nNaNO3 - 60%\nMg/Al (~80-100 mesh) - 25%\nS - 10 %\nDex. - 5%", "title": "Blue star with yellow insert", "publishedDate": "2012-06-23T18:04:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4258roIYc", "description": "extrous in chenille it's anionic see conakry a wastage it copybook not rufus some bissau and autumnal", "title": "Broken Before A Frozen God", "publishedDate": "2006-10-02T08:13:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4AxR2msRw", "description": "Just move Wii", "title": "Darryn Bowdler throwing some moves - Just Dance", "publishedDate": "2012-07-25T22:32:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4C2szBk8A", "description": "", "title": "C\u00f3mo solucionar problemas de un fusible de la bomba de combustible", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T02:22:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4NhZVRODE", "description": "what is the definition of Asclepius: One of the earliest Greek gods to specialize in healing. He was known to the Romans as Aesculapius. Healers and those in need of healing invoked Asclepius' name in prayer and healing ceremonies in temples and at home. A healing clan known as the Asclepiads claimed to be the descendants of Asclepius and to have inherited a knowledge and mystical power of healing from him.\n\nAsclepius did not begin as a god. It is now thought that he was an actual historical figure, renowned for his healing abilities. When he and his sons, Machaon and Podalirios, are mentioned in The Iliad in approximately the 8th century BCE, they are not gods. As his \"clan\" of followers grew, he was elevated to divine status, and temples were built to him throughout the Mediterranean world well into late antiquity.\n\nImages of Asclepius are generally recognizable by his beard and staff with a single snake. (The caduceus with its two intertwined snakes grasping a staff has been adopted by some as the \"ancient\" symbol of medicine. In the ancient world, however, the caduceus was a symbol of Hermes, the Roman Mercury, who was primarily a messenger god linked with commerce.) Asclepius' symbol was a single snake entwined around his staff -- the \"Asclepian staff.\" The snake symbolized rejuvenation and healing to many ancient Mediterranean cultures.\n\n\n\n\nmedical terminology, medical dictionary, medical dictionary free download, medical terminology made easy, medical terminology song", "title": "What Is The Definition Of Asclepius Medical Dictionary Free Online", "publishedDate": "2014-09-10T01:52:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4Oh8t4Fz0", "description": "a test", "title": "I.F.Y.M - FACE GRIND", "publishedDate": "2008-01-27T13:22:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "BR4yQFZK9YM", "description": "Music video by P!nk performing Stupid Girls.

In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope; these are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "big nosed girl eats a living octopus in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T20:51:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BRNiagLn9Co", "description": "Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl) recrystallizing from a hot solution.

Available from http://mrbongo.com/products/hamlet-1964\n\nThe surface of ceremonies and rituals celebrating the coronation of King Claudius (Mikhail Nazvanov) and his marriage to Hamlet's mother (Elza Radzina) leaves the young prince indifferent. Hamlet's melancholic nature finds no relief from his brooding, not even in his courtship of Ophelia (Anastasiya Vertinskaya). However, a nocturnal visit from his father's ghost changes everything. Claudius' treachery having been brought to light, Hamlet conducts a quest to avenge his father's death.\n \nGrigori Kozintsev's renowned Soviet production ranks among the finest adaptations of Shakespeare on film. His strong visual style places the characters on a rich widescreen canvas while preserving the inward dimension of Hamlet's character. Laurence Olivier, director and star of Hamlet, the Oscar-winning 1948 English production, praised Kozintsev's Hamlet, singling out Innokenty Smoktunevsky's performance as the definitive screen performance of the Prince of Denmark.\n\nA spectacle...a large, mobile, realistic rendering of the melodramatic action of the play that depends entirely for its impact upon its striking scenery, the physical sweep of its performance and the grand effects that the camera achieves -- New York Times\n\nKozintsev has thought his interpretation right through to the end with complete consistency, and gives the film a genuinely exciting epic sweep...There's a genuine cinematic imagination at work here -- Time Out\n\nLIKE MR BONGO - https://www.facebook.com/mrbongoworldwide\nFOLLOW MR BONGO - https://twitter.com/therealmrbongo\nVISIT THE WEBSITE - http://www.mrbongo.com/", "title": "Hamlet (1964) - Directed by Grigori Kozintsev - Clip 3", "publishedDate": "2011-09-14T14:11:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "BROURRjSI1U", "description": "How to use Ashieda Natural Collagen Facial Mask.\n\nTo purchase a clinically proven effective facial mask for $9.99 go to:\n\nhttps://www.ashieda.com/store/natural-facial-mask/", "title": "How to use the Natural Collagen Facial Mask by Ashieda", "publishedDate": "2013-04-17T23:22:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "BROa0tB4tIM", "description": "Buy 6 Years Stil vor Talent Compilation on Beatport: http://www.beatport.com/release/6-years-stil-vor-talent/653343\n\nThis Track is from the 6 years Stil vor Talent Birthday Compilation\nreleasedate: 12.09.2011\n\nArtist: Animal Trainer\nTrack: Krambambuli\nLabel: Stil vor Talent (SVT065)\nDistr.: WordandSound/Zebralution\nReleaseDate: 12.09.2011\n\ncheck the release here:\nhttp://www.whatpeopleplay.com/albumdetails/null/id/43826\n\nand here:\nhttp://soundcloud.com/stilvortalent/sets/svt065-6-years-stil-vor-talent\n\nVideo by: Bildst\u00f6rung \nTrack w&p by: Animal Trainer", "title": "Animal Trainer - Krambambuli (Stil vor Talent)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-02T07:11:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BROfx-KAKRw", "description": "SI TE GUSTA EL VALLENATO SUSCRIBETE EN EL CANAL", "title": "ESPOSA MIA - OTTO SERGE & RAFAEL RICARDO ((GRANDES EXITOS))", "publishedDate": "2013-05-26T19:26:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BROjtljGH0E", "description": "jackass 24 hour takeover BTS.

Units can report and be equipped at the same location.\n\nHe said after every mobilisation exercise, the soldiers go through a debriefing on the areas that they think can be improved.\n\nHe added that the different backgrounds of NSmen meant they are able to contribute a good variety of constructive suggestions.\n\nThese ideas are then collated and can be used by the SAF for the next mobilisation exercise.\n\nMr Chan said: \"From the individual's perspective, a typical NSman in the past would come back to in-camp or open mobilisation and it would take him maybe 10-12 hours, just to go and get all his equipment, get briefed.\n\n\"But in the new system, you see they can complete this in a much shorter time.

One wiring scheme is resistive rest at ground, which has been used in the past by various manufacturers including Ford Motor Company. Resistive rest at ground is meant to keep both power door lock solenoids grounded, and then a positive pulse is applied when needed. \n\nThe power door solenoid or actuator is nothing more than a DC motor type component, which changes the direction of the lock actuation by reverse polarity. In other words, the door lock is actuated by reversing the polarity going to the solenoid. Here is where a relay becomes a very versatile controller of sorts.\n\nHere's how the circuit works:\n\nPower is fed from the fuse to terminal 85 of the relay coil. This right away tells us that the relay actuation is going to be by ground, which is a lot safer. From the fuse, power is also fed to terminal 87 of the relay. This is a variation of how we normally connect terminal 30, which normally goes to power. But, not here where terminal 30 is used as an output. Terminal 87A is connected, on both relays, to chassis ground. \n\nIn this configuration, both relays connect the ....

You can see how many you've found by pausing the game during a mission, or by checking out your progress in mission select.\nAfter picking up a collectible it will be saved automatically and immediately. You don't have to pick it up again if you die. You may also leave the game immediately after finding one, without having to reach the next checkpoint. Your progress will still be saved.\n\nPicking up weapons from dead enemies does also add up to your collectible progress towards \"Recon\", but they are not actually needed. In other words: if you pick up weapons of enemies you might get the trophy / achievement earlier, but it's totally optional and not needed. To get \"Full arsenal\" you must get all of the Dog Tags & Hidden Weapons.\n\nBattlefield 4 Collectible Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRr5L69yg_kE2NGX9nnKDP4EyHgd-Cmty\n\nTIMELINE:\n#1 - Dog Tag - 0:05\n#2 - Weapon - 0:32\n#3 - Weapon - 1:05\n#4 - Dog Tag - 2:06\n#5 - Weapon - 2:36\n#6 - Dog Tag - 3:14\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFollow Me:\nhttp://www.powerpyx.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx\nhttp://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx\n\nContact Me:\nmail@powerpyx.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", "title": "Battlefield 4 - All Collectible Locations (Dog Tags & Weapons) - Mission 4: Singapore", "publishedDate": "2013-10-31T05:37:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "BRk-ORC6_j4", "description": "Intel South Africa has been reinventing themselves in the last year and an innovative approach to everything they do is the order of business.\nNew technology and new approaches have been developed and an amazing new campaign has come to life.\n\nIt's all about EXPRESSING YOURSELF!\n\nIndividuality, self-expression and exhibitionism are all fuelling the runaway growth of social networking.

He makes massive replicas of everyday objects for public spaces. He's responsible for sculptures such as saw, shuttlecock, tools, apple core, bow and arrow, dropped cone, paint torch, free stamp, safety pin, trowel and cherry on a spoon. His work is considered to relate to the Pop Art movement because he uses imagery from popular culture; newspapers and advertising. \n\nOldenburg also makes soft sculptures of everyday objects for art galleries. Soft sculptures are sculptures made using soft, supple materials such as cloth, foam and paper. Examples of Oldenburg's soft sculptures include sausages and pancakes, typewriter, hamburger, giant BLT, French fries and ketchup, viola, floor cake, pay telephone, toilet and switches.\n\nIn response to Claes Oldenburg's work I have decided to make a soft hamburger, chips and peas out of newspaper. To make the Oldenburger and bun I'm rolling the edges of the newspaper in on themselves until they form thick disks, which can be stacked. For the chips I tear the newspaper into forms that can be rolled between the palms of the hands. And for the peas I use smaller bits of paper and roll them into balls.\nAnd that is how to make a soft sculpture of an Oldenburger, chips and peas out of newspaper.", "title": "Art Lesson: Claes Oldenburg", "publishedDate": "2014-03-13T21:52:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "BRkOOB7Bg-4", "description": "Laetitia enters, and reveals that Carboy's mixup has been averted.

Lack of preparation for this question could very well cost you the job.  One of the most important things is to be honest, otherwise it will show.  Ask yourself the question first, why do you want to work there?  \n\nIf your answer is that you just need a job and paycheck, then dig a little deeper.  If you still can't come up with an honest answer, then read on and hopefully I'll help you think of something. Make sure you have a clear understanding of why you want to work for them and that it's more than \"just a job\" to you.  Do you admire this company?  Do you like their products?  Do they have a great success story?  The key here is what is important to you about this company.\n\nThe best way to prepare for this question is to research the company before you attend the interview and learn everything you can, past, present and future.  Remember, the idea behind the interview is to find the best and most qualified candidate for the job and one that will best fit in with its culture. At this point, you should describe how your past experience has prepared you for this company.\n\nYour answer should demonstrate your familiarity with the company and its products and by doing this the interviewer will recognize you as a serious candidate.  Interviewers like to hear praise about their company because it further solidifies the company's reputation in their own mind, but don't overdo it because it will come out sounding fake and cheap.\n\nSee sample answers in the Complete Interview Answer Guide from Job Interview Tools\n\nhttp://www.jobinterviewtools.com/blog/job-interview/interview-questions/top-10-interview-questions/\n    http://www.jobinterviewtools.com/blog/sample-thank-you-letter-after-interview/\n    http://www.jobinterviewtools.com/blog/format-a-list-of-job-references/\n    http://www.jobinterviewtools.com/blog/job-interview/interview-questions/management-interview-questions/\n    http://www.jobinterviewtools.com/blog/tell-me-about-yourself-examples/", "title": "Why do you want to work here - Common Interview Questions", "publishedDate": "2009-10-12T02:54:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "BRm0M8zFHeM", "description": "(Para subt\u00edtulos en espa\u00f1ol, pulse el bot\u00f3n \"CC\" o \"Captions\")\n\nThe Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park Directorate are working together to effectively control invasive quinine on Santa Cruz Island.\n---\nLa Fundaci\u00f3n Charles Darwin y la Direcci\u00f3n del Parque Nacional Gal\u00e1pagos est\u00e1n trabajando juntos para controlar eficazmente la quinina invasora en la Isla Santa Cruz.", "title": "Controlling the Invasive Red Quinine Tree in Galapagos", "publishedDate": "2014-07-31T15:29:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BRm_-EQkomM", "description": "http://australianmuseum.net.au/Cooks-Scorpionfish-Scorpaena-cardinalis/\n\nA Cook's Scorpionfish at a depth of 20 m, West Macauley Island, Kermadec Islands, New Zealand, 21 May 2011.

Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses?

LPG, a by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining, includes various mixtures of hydrocarbons. The type of LPG used as a motor vehicle fuel is a liquid mixture containing at least 90 percent propane, 2.5 percent butane and higher hydrocarbons, and the balance is ethane and propylene. The mixture is commonly called \"propane\" among general consumers, but motor vehicle operators using the fuel refer to it as LPG.  In 1910, under the direction of Dr. Walter Snelling, the U.S. Bureau of Mines investigated gasoline to see why it evaporated so fast and discovered that the evaporating gases were propane, butane, and other light hydrocarbons. Dr. Snelling built a still that could separate the gasoline into its liquid and gaseous components and sold his propane patent to Frank Phillips, the founder of Phillips Petroleum Company.  By 1912, propane gas was cooking food in the home. The first car powered by propane ran in 1913. By 1915 people were using propane in torches to cut through metal. LPG has been used as a transportation fuel, mainly in heavy trucks and forklift vehicles, around the world for more than 60 years.  On December 28th , 1984, a  preventable tragedy in the giant gas-works on the outskirts of Mexico City left 500 dead and public facilities crammed with injured people. The LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) was stored in massive million-gallon containers which was a disastrous mistake. The gas should have been stored in smaller receptacles in various locations to prevent a calamity like this occurring.  On January 30, 2007, four people were killed and five others were seriously injured when propane vapors from a storage tank ignited and exploded at the Little General convenience store and gas station in Ghent, West Virginia. Propane was used as fuel inside the building, which was completely destroyed.   The US Chemical Safety Board has produced an excellent DVD on this tragic incident, Half An Hour to Tragedy which is available for viewing and free downloading at http://www.csb.gov/videoroom/detail.aspx?vid=15&F=0&CID=1&pg=1&F_All=y .

The Klingons are hoping to perform a little damage control after triggering a mining disaster on one of their moons; their spokesman is the seemingly contrite General Chang (Christopher Plummer).

Blaustein, Jerry Lewis, Steve Oedekerk, Bill Richmond, Tom Shadyac, David Sheffield\nFilm Description: Eddie Murphy gives one of Jerry Lewis' best-remembered vehicles a 1990s overhaul in this hit comedy. Sherman Klump (Murphy) is a college professor and respected biochemistry researcher who is kind, considerate, and a genuinely nice guy. Sherman is also appallingly overweight; coupled with the fact that he's painfully shy and a bit clumsy, his romantic prospects are rather bleak. When Sherman finds himself working with a pretty graduate student, Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), he falls in love and is eager to impress her, but at an upscale nightclub, his weight attracts the attention of an insult comic (Dave Chappelle) and his bumbling spoils the evening. Sherman's latest project is a genetic weight loss formula, and despondent over his failure to win Carla's heart, he subjects himself to a massive dose. Suddenly, Sherman is transformed into the slim, trim, and handsome Buddy Love; however, the drug also boosts his testosterone level, turning the likable Sherman into the arrogant, skirt-chasing Buddy. In addition to playing Sherman and Buddy, Eddie Murphy also plays four other members of the porcine Klump family, as well as eccentric exercise guru Lance Perkins.\n\n\"the nutty professor\",\"the nutty professor clip\",\"the nutty professor part 1\",\"the nutty professor 2\",\"eddie murphy\",\"tom shadyac\",\"food videos\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"screwball comedies\",\"slapstick comedies\",\"brian grazer\",\"karen kehela\",\"james d brubaker\",\"jerry lewis\",\"russell simmons\",\"conflict videos\",\"family videos\",\"dinner table videos\",\"sherman klump\",\"papa klump\",\"mama klump\",\"ernie klump\",\"grandma klump\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++136219,/m/0f7hc", "title": "Klump Family Dinner - The Nutty Professor (3/12) Movie CLIP (1996) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T07:42:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BS9IIOtw2n0", "description": "This is a quick video on the side effects of metformin.

In the first issue of that journal, out this month, MIT researchers report the first self-contained autonomous soft robot, a \"fish\" that can execute an escape maneuver, convulsing its body to change direction, in just 100 milliseconds, or as quickly as a real fish can.\n\n\"We're excited about soft robots for a variety of reasons,\" says Daniela Rus, a professor of computer science and engineering, director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and one of the researchers who designed and built the fish. \"As robots penetrate the physical world and start interacting with people more and more, it's much easier to make robots safe if their bodies are so wonderfully soft that there's no danger if they whack you.\"\n \nThe robotic fish was built by Andrew Marchese, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and lead author on the new paper, where he's joined by Rus and postdoc Cagdas D. Onal. Each side of the fish's tail is bored through with a long, tightly undulating channel. Carbon dioxide released from a canister in the fish's abdomen causes the channel to inflate, bending the tail in the opposite direction.\n\nRead more: http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2014/soft-robotic-fish-moves-like-the-real-thing-0313.html\n\nVideo: Melanie Gonick, MIT News\nHigh-speed footage courtesy of Andrew Marchese", "title": "Autonomous, self-contained soft robotic fish at MIT", "publishedDate": "2014-03-13T13:28:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSApfIOkYo0", "description": "Thanks for the bump down 752.

The permanent population is just over 100,000 (2011) on 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi). The nation is composed of 32 atolls and one raised coral island, Banaba, dispersed over 3.5 million square kilometres, (1,351,000 square miles) straddling the equator, and bordering the International Date Line at its easternmost point.\n\nThe name Kiribati is the local pronunciation of Gilberts, which derives from the main island chain, named the Gilbert Islands after the British explorer Thomas Gilbert, who sailed through the islands in 1788. The capital, South Tarawa, consists of a number of islets connected through a series of causeways, located in the Tarawa archipelago. Kiribati became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and became a full member of the United Nations in 1999.\n\nKiribati was named in French by captains Krusenstern and Louis Isidore Duperrey \"\u00eeles Gilbert\", Gilbert Islands, after the British Captain Thomas Gilbert, who sighted the islands in 1788. The current name, Kiribati, is an adaptation of \"Gilberts\", from the former European name the \"Gilbert Islands\". Although the indigenous name for the Gilbert Islands proper is Tungaru in Gilbertese language, the new state chose the name Kiribati, the Gilbertese rendition of Gilberts, as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of islands never considered part of the Gilberts chain.\n\nThe area now called Kiribati has been inhabited by Micronesians speaking the same Oceanic language since sometime between 3000 BC and AD 1300. The area was not isolated; invaders from Tonga and Samoa, and from Fiji, later introduced Polynesian and Melanesian cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.\n\nContact with Europeans began in the 16th century when Magellan, Saavedra and Quir\u00f3s discovered and conquered the islands of Pope Clement VIII in 1520, the islands of the Queen Catalina in 1528 and the Island (La) Carolina in 1606 (Spanish rule lasted from 1528-1885), at that time the islands of Santa Catalina, were named in honor of queen Catherine of Aragon.[citation needed] Whalers, slave traders and merchant ships arrived in large numbers during the 19th century, and the resulting agitation fomented internal conflicts between tribes and introduced European epidemics.\n\nThe main island chain was named the Gilbert Islands in 1820 by a Russian admiral, Adam von Krusenstern, and French captain Louis Duperrey, after a British captain named Thomas Gilbert, who crossed the archipelago in 1788 when sailing from Australia to China.\n\nFrom the early 19th century, Western whalers, merchant vessels and slave traders visited the islands, introducing diseases and firearms. The first British settlers arrived in 1837. In 1892 the Gilbert Islands consented to become a British protectorate together with the nearby Ellice Islands. They were administered by the Western Pacific High Commission based in Fiji. Together they became the crown colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916. Christmas Island (or Kiritimati) became part of the colony in 1919 and the Phoenix Islands were added in 1937. Sir Arthur Grimble was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa (1913--1919) and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926.\n\nTarawa Atoll and others of the Gilbert group were occupied by Japan during World War II. Tarawa was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in US Marine Corps history. Marines landed in November 1943; the Battle of Tarawa was fought at Kiribati's former capital Betio on Tarawa Atoll.\n\nSome of the islands of Kiribati, especially in the remote Line Islands, were formerly used by the United States and United Kingdom for nuclear weapons testing including hydrogen bombs in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati", "title": "Top 10 Largest Cities or Towns of Kiribati", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T12:16:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSF8WD7jSVc", "description": "Instagram/Twitter-Thatdudeinblue\nLike the Facebook!-https://www.facebook.com/thatdudeinblue\nT-Shirts!-http://thatdudeinblue.spreadshirt.com\nTwitch!-http://www.twitch.tv/thatdudeinblue/profile\nThis is just a small clip from the Virginia Tech meet that was a tad out of place, so I figured I'd just show you guys the funny clip.

Naturally, Leeds already has his mind set on his teaching plan and proceeds to play loud rock music in class in order to teach the students to feel the vibrations of the music and get them to try to speak phonetically. But a new element enters his life when he meets the attractive custodian, Sarah (Marlee Matlin). An exceptionally intelligent yet extremely bitter young woman, Sarah is a graduate of the school who has decided to remain there, in the confines of her world of silence; it's safer for her to be with her own \"people\" than to face what she perceives as a cruel and uncaring world. She hardly seems interested in James and will only communicate with him through signing, although she can read lips and even speak a little. James learns from Sarah's mother (Piper Laurie) that Sarah was sexually molested as a teenager; this explains why she is so wary of his attempts to form a relationship with her and why she is so full of fear. Eventually, James does get through to Sarah and the two fall in love, although both have to learn new ways to communicate their feelings. Though it seldom resembles the Mark Medoff play on which it was based, this directing debut from Randa Haines won an Best Actress Oscar for Matlin, for her first screen performance.\n\n\"children of a lesser god\",\"william hurt\",\"marlee matlin\",\"randa haines\",\"clothing videos\",\"shoe videos\",\"romantic dramas\",tearjerkers,\"patrick j palmer\",\"burt sugarman\",\"candace koethe\",\"love videos\",\"romance videos\",\"school videos\",\"swimming pool videos\",\"james leeds\",\"sarah norman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9273,/m/016khd,/m/018z_c", "title": "Children of a Lesser God (3/7) Movie CLIP - Falling Into The Pool With You (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T09:40:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSFui_efkW4", "description": "truly the son of a master rooseman!", "title": "a friendly jape", "publishedDate": "2013-06-21T13:25:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSFw8iAyoF4", "description": "Strombus gigas Linnaeus, 1758.

Pod. M.,discusses the symptoms, causes and treatments for Foot Warts.\nhttp://www.wilsonfootclinic.com\n\nMost foot warts are harmless, even though they may be painful. They are often mistaken for corns or calluses, which are layers of dead skin that build up to protect an area which is being continuously irritated. A wart, however, is caused by a viral infection which invades the skin through small or invisible cuts and abrasions. Foot warts are generally raised and fleshy and can appear anywhere on the foot or toes. Occasionally, warts can spontaneously disappear after a short time, and then, just as frequently, they recur in the same location. If left untreated, warts can grow to an inch or more in circumference and can spread into clusters of warts. Children, especially teenagers, tend to be more susceptible to warts than adults. \n\nVisit our website: http://www.wilsonfootclinic.com", "title": "Foot Warts (Plantar Wart) - Chiropodist Peter Wilson,  Burlington, Oakville and Milton, ON", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T21:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSeEqn8DJMM", "description": "facebook.com/syranic\ntwitter.com/syranic\n\nshop.syranic.com", "title": "SYRANIC - Endless Open End", "publishedDate": "2010-09-29T22:13:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSeJPsnh3zE", "description": "hab ich heuer unbedingt mal singen m\u00fcssen", "title": "Rudolf das kleine Rentier", "publishedDate": "2011-12-23T19:08:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSeL2dUyMRM", "description": "Buy online: http://monstergardens.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=60_87\n\nMonsterGardens.com , Completes setup of the original Secret Jardin DR 120.\nYou can view more information on the new DR120 II on our website. \nSecret Jardin's Best Priced at \nMonsterGardens.com", "title": "Dark Room 120 - DR120 - Secret Jardin - MONSTER GARDENS | DR120 Setup Directions SilverBox", "publishedDate": "2011-01-24T16:17:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSeSlp6Sq44", "description": "A brief encounter with a slow worm (a type of legless lizard) in my garden early August", "title": "Slow worm (Anguis fragilis) in my garden", "publishedDate": "2010-08-05T17:58:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSedTArn4xM", "description": "Old Flossy\nby Don Johnson\nMtGravatt-Brisbane-Australia\nIT WAS THERE ON SHARPEN STATION, \nWEST NEAR ADAVALE I'D BE. \nBACK IN THE EARLY THIRTIES, \nWORST DROUGHT YOU'D EVER SEE. \nFIVE THOUSAND COWS WERE DYING SLOW, \nBROUGHT FROM LAKE NASH TO ADAVALE. \nTHEY LIVED ON MULGA BUSHES LOW, \nTO FEED THEIR BODIES FRAIL. \nI WAS THE BOY WHO MANNED THE PUMP, \nFAT CROWS IN THOUSANDS WAITED. \nWITH NOT A BLADE OF GRASS OR SINGLE CLUMP, \nTHOSE CROWS FOR SURE I HATED. \nTHE CATTLE BITCH OLD FLOSSY HAD NINE PUPS, \nMORE COMPANY FOR ME. \nFOR I'D GET A VISIT ONCE A MONTH, \nYES IT'S THEN THE BOSS I'D SEE. \nTHE DEAD COWS AROUND THE TROUGH DID LIE, \nAND I'D SNIG THEM RIGHT AWAY. \nI'D SHIFTED HUNDREDS BY AND BY, \nCUT AND QUARTERED WHERE THEY LAY. \nTHE PUPS WERE DISAPPEARING FAST, \nONE EVERY DAY FOR SURE. \nI CHECKED THE CAMP AND MISSED THE LAST, \nSAW SNAKE TRACKS UPON THE FLOOR. \nOLD MULGA SNAKE WOULD BREATHE NO MORE, \nHE'D HAD HIS LAST PUP MEAL. \nHE WAS BIG AS NINE FOOT FOUR, \nWHEN THE LAST PUP HE DID STEAL. \nOLD FLOSSY FOUGHT HIM TOOTH AND NAIL, \nHE'D BIT HER ALSO TOO. \nSHE CHEWED HIS HEAD OFF DIDN`T FAIL, \nWAS DYING THIS SHE KNEW. \nI HELD HER DYING WITH MY ARM, \nHER PLEADING EYES I SAW. \nSHE WENT TO SLEEP SO VERY CALM, \nPASSED ON THROUGH DEATH'S FRONT DOOR. \nIn 1936 old yellow Flossy died game\nhttp://www.scullywag.com/kokoda1942stoush/dhj1.html", "title": "Old Flossy died game.wmv", "publishedDate": "2011-01-23T00:11:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSedVRscVOE", "description": "FENNEP '08.1 - Gustavo & Anderson - Compunction (CZ) - S-S - (1\u00aa Fase)\n\nV\u00eddeo da 1\u00aa fase da categoria Speed Masculino, do Festival Norte-Nordeste de Pump It Up - Brasil, realizado no Danny's Park do Shopping Via Direta, Natal-RN, no dia 24.05.2008.\n\nDownload (4shared.com):\nhttp://www.4shared.com/file/53341556/7185b61c/FENNEP_081_-_Gustavo__Anderson_-_Compunction__CZ__-_S-S_-__1_Fase_.html?dirPwdVerified=f97cdef2\n\nDownload (PumpBR.net):", "title": "FENNEP '08.1 - Gustavo & Anderson - Compunction (CZ)", "publishedDate": "2008-06-29T08:41:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSegtYgQtqY", "description": "http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi Learn Hindi in 3 Steps. Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Speak Hindi Phrases - The Key If You Want to Learn to Speak Hindi Fluently", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T12:37:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSf9k7BOqM4", "description": "", "title": "Maxim Ivanov and Pittsburgh Penguins practice", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T05:41:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSfBx9uma3Y", "description": "Directed Ryan Torbati and Qaivon Tehranivafa\n2013 Funniest Videos\n\nSurvival of the Fittest!

The celebration came to a close at the same time as the 75-year jubilee for this college in Rome.&quot;I believe that all priests should be bearers of a Gospel that comes from Jesus Christ -- and not our own Gospel. The priest should present the Gospel in such a way that he communicates a little bit of what the mystery of God is. Therefore, these 75 years are a moment of transition so that in the years to come priests can continue to be educated with the heart of Christ.&quot; Fr. Jo&atilde;o Roque Rohr, Rector of the Pontifical College Pio Brasileiro in Rome, also stressed the priests' mission:&quot;I believe that the great message is to evangelize &ndash;- I mean, to announce with a new strength and courage and with new means the same message of the Gospel: that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and that we are at the service of humanity.&quot;  The successor of Saint Ignatius of Loyola underlined the need that the world has for hope and mercy: &quot;We are trying to educate priests that have -&ndash; as said in the Letter to the Ephesians &ndash;- the depth of the knowledge of Christ in order to transmit a message of mercy, of hope, and of joy to others.

Within five-to-ten years, doctors believe pancreatic cancer will become the second deadliest behind lung cancer. As Fox 17 News anchor Nick Paranjape reports, one reason is because it's difficult to diagnose.\"I didn't expect to survive,\" said Mary Maddox.But she did, seven years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\"Pancreatic cancer is the only major cancer with the survival rate under ten percent,\" said Dr. Berlin.That's exactly why Dr. Jordan Berlin, an Oncologist at Vanderbilt Ingram cancer center, calls Mary a miracle. The pancreas is an organ, shaped like a fish that creates enzymes for digestion and hormones like insulin. It's tucked way behind many organs and sandwiched between the spine and stomach. A tumor can be hard to find.\"Pancreatic cancers are very hard to see on all of our scans cat scans, MIR's, pet scans,\" added Dr. Berlin.Dr. Berlin says pancreatic cancer symptoms are not specific either. \"The one thing that becomes specific is a lot patients can develop jaundice,\" said Dr. Berlin\"I turned yellow first,\" exclaimed Maddox.And that is what saved Mary's life. Developing jaundice and then having the surgical procedure called \"the whipple effect\" where the head of the pancreas is removed, but the body and tail is kept. It is a complicated and risky procedure, but it worked for Mary whose mother died of pancreatic cancer.\"It was a miracle mine was diagnosed early,\" said Maddox.Dr. Berlin says more and more people are being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer because everyone is living longer.\"Pancreatic cancer increases as you age, so you have an increased risk as you get older,\" said Dr. Berlin.That is why Mary is proudly wearing her purple and to get the word out.\"Pancreatic cancer doesn't get research doesn't get all the funding the other cancers do it's not as a well-known although it is rising in the ranks,\" said Maddox.Many risk factors can lead to pancreatic cancer like smoking, obesity, and diets heavy in fats and rich in sugars. In fact, a recent study says eating a piece of sausage or having two strips of bacon \"every day\" can increase your chances of getting pancreatic cancer by 19-percent.", "title": "Pancreatic Cancer Survior", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T01:33:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BSoRIQ1fQOY", "description": "Palma Nova is one of the quieter resorts in Majorca, although the lively nightlife of Magaluf is nearby.

It can be used directly on a circuit board or independently. The design of the metal tips allows easy holding and clamping of chip components while measuring them. The tweezer's plugs fit into standard sockets of any digital multimeter. The device has flexible connecting cables. You can easily move it around the object to find the best position for taking measurements. The metal plated joint of the tweezer is designed to make highly accurate measurements, despite the capabilities of the multimeter you've chosen. Let's check the following components using this convenient device.On the electric board we'll check whether the resistor chip is broken. The device must be unplugged from the mains. Naturally, the batteries must be fully discharged. In most cases, if we measure low-ohmic and bridge resistors, the results will be positive. Keep it in mind, that other components as well as the multimeter itself can slightly increase the resistance in the circuit. Measuring low-ohmic resistors can sometimes give us wrong critical parameters of the basic circuit. It is better to measure an unsoldered defective component. While searching for defects in a circuit of an electric device we often encounter a hard to reach place. Here the measurement has to be taken with the bare tips of the device. They can get very close to other components. Today component density is a standard in packaging circuit boards with microelements of SMD components. The insulated handles of our tweezer will help us get to all the hard to reach places. This device can also detect faulty capacitors, including tantalum capacitors. It can measure the bias voltage of planar transistors and microcircuits.Despite of its size, the twizzer can easily hold a miniature SMD component. And don't forget that your measurements are most precise when there is only one component in your tweezer!", "title": "Test Tweezer -- TLM12", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T09:44:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "BT3nCbuVpS8", "description": "xx", "title": "elaeagnus angustifolia", "publishedDate": "2011-08-14T17:37:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BT4KE6vR9oI", "description": "Few minutes from the episode MOTORBIKE", "title": "Some mothers do 'ave 'em Motorbike", "publishedDate": "2007-10-17T01:15:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "BT4Z1l1F3dw", "description": "Promo & Distribution - http://strikeforce360media.com\nThe House Hookers Website -http://www.thehousehookers.com/ \n\nFresh signing to Quadraphonic - Manchester DJing duo, The House Hookers are a true force not to be reckoned with as DJs and producers they are equally passionate about their house music as they are about the crowds they play to.\n\nWith over 20+ years DJing experience between them that ranges from big outdoor raves to intimate gatherings, the moment the pair joined forces and embarked on their epic journey in 2010, Jon & Nick have been on what can only be described as a roller coaster adventure which is getting faster.\n\nKnown for their uplifting music & the big floor fillers & the things they do, these crazy ladshave played at clubs all over the global over the years, the UK, Europe & the US in the likes of -- Sankey's, Space, Love to Be, Ministry of Sound, Pacha, Amnesia, Gatecrasher, Size Matters, Toolroom the list goes on.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n]This footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Music was important to his family and he learned traditional songs in French and English from his father. Behind A Voice is his debut CD. \n\nMost of the songs included on this CD were written by Poirier, with the exception of \"Boat on the River,\" \"Black Ribbons\" and \"Dirty Old Town.\" In the former category is \"Doin' Nothin',\" a celebration of, well, doing nothing. Poirier's voice and the chorus of \"ba ba ba ba ba ba ba boppin' along on the water\" evokes a carefree afternoon spent in a small boat fishing (or not!). Far different is the sorrowful \"Lament for Michelle,\" an Acadian ancestor who was forcibly moved from his home. Here, Fleur Mainville's plaintive fiddle playing sets the tone of the lament. \n\nDespite Poirier's regard for traditional music, there is only one traditional tune on the CD, and that is \"Rolling Down to Old Maui.\" Sung a cappella, it showcases Poirier's deep, warm voice (and for those unfamiliar with the seafaring song, the mention of Maui in a traditional song might come as a surprise). \n\nIf the chosen songs are any indication, Poirier has a fascination with water and the sea. Aside from the nautical artwork and photos of the CD jacket, fully half the songs mention water, islands or the sea.

There is a reason that the American Heart Association recommends exercise for heart health, because it works and it works very well. I would encourage you to listen to this whole video. It's brief and to the point and it will really help you appreciate just how important exercise is.\n\nGenerally speaking, regular exercise is going to reduce your risk of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and heart failure, including death. It also has protective effects against stroke, diabetes and cancer, although I'll be focusing on the heart in this lecture.\n\nI'm going to quickly summarize those benefits, but let's first review the exercise recommendations of the AHA. Here are their recommendations for overall cardiovascular health:\n\nAt least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150 \n\nOR At least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes; or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity\n\nAND Moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week for additional health benefits.\n\nKEY WORDS\nheart muscle\nmyocardium\nDecreased oxygen demand\nefficiently\nImproved blood flow \ncoronary blood vessels\ncoronary arterties\nnitric oxide\ndeliver blood\nendothelium\nstem cells of the heart\nendothelial proginator cells\ncirculating angiogenic cells\natherosclerosis \nplaque\nclogged artery\nImproved lipid profile\ncholesterol\nLDL (bad) cholesterol\nlow density lipoprotein\ntriglycerides\nimproves HDL (good)\nhigh density lipoprotein\nLower blood pressure\nhigh blood pressure\nhypertension\nbody fat\nfat loss\nadioposity\ninsulin sensitivity \nblood sugar\nglucose\ndiabetes\nDecreased inflammation\nC-reactive protein\nCRP\npsychological\ndepression\nstress \nsocial activity and support\ncognitive function\ndementia\nthromboses\nDVT\ndeep vein thrombosis\npulmonary embolism\nthrombosis\nblood clots\nplatelet\nblood viscosity\nfibrinogen\nfibrinolysis\nclot break down\nclot buster\narrhythmias\nvagal tone\nsympathetic activity,\nepinephrine\nadrenaline\nheart rate \nweight loss\nlose weight\nexercise tolerance\nskeletal muscle function and strength\nprotein\nlung function\nquit smoking\naerobic capacity\noxygen utilization\nworkout\nbuild muscle\nbodybuild\npower lift\nexercise\nphysical activity\nstrength train\npersonal trainer\nHIT\nhigh intensity training\ninterval training\ncore\nposture\nfat burn\nbody weight routine\ncardio\ncardiovascular disease\nCAD\nCHD\ncoronary heart disease\nischemia\nischemic heart disease\nobesity\noverweight\nBMI\nbody mass index\ncardiometabolic risk factors", "title": "How to Protect Your Heart: Understanding The Cardioprotective Effects of Regular Exercise", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T15:07:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTIvF_8pYG8", "description": "", "title": "Long Rally Ended by a Rhea Dimaculangan Hit", "publishedDate": "2012-06-04T15:38:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTJ96LvjXkw", "description": "The video is issued by Xinxiang Xinda Energy Equipment Co.,Ltd.\nAny further information,pls contact with us!\nContact way: 0086 (0)373 6383355  Email: sarah@xindae.com or biz@xindae.com\nWebsite: http//www.xindae.com  \n             http://sinoxinda.en.alibaba.com", "title": "Distillation Plant/ Distilled Tyre Oil into Diesel -Xinxiang Xinda Energy Equipment Co.,Ltd (1)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-27T02:35:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTJAme_l0_c", "description": "Kohistan", "title": "Kohistan Kaiga Markhor Fight By Muhammad Irshad Khan", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T03:25:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTK6Yc295jo", "description": "The keeper had just left after coming through to check on the buff crested bustard and the hammerkops in the Zoo's African Savanna section of the McNeil Avian Center.

It is tesded with real GameBoy hardware, and it works.\n\nThis is a guide on how you clone a pokemon in pokemon Gold/Silver. It is pretty simple, but it might get a little complicated keeping everything organized.\n\nYou need:\n1. The pokemon(s) you want duplicated (any items held by the pokemon(s) will also be duplicated)\n2. Another pokemon, it doesn't matter whitch.\n3. Access to a Pokemon center (or Bill's PC).\n\n1. Make sure to have the other pokemon and the pokemon(s) you want duplicated in your inventory.\n\n2. Make sure the pokemons to be duplicated are holding the items you want duplicated. This step is of course optinal.\n\n3. Access Bills PC, and change to an empty box, even if the current box is empty.\n\n4. Deposite the pokemon(s) to be duplicated.\n\n5. Change to any other box, but here is the imporiant note: when the game saves, this message start to scroll \"SAVING... DON'T TURN OFF THE POWER.\". While the word \"OFF\" is being scrolled onto the screen, turn off the power immediately.\n\n6. The next time you turn on the power and loads your saved game, the pokemon(s) to be duplicated is both in your inventory and in Bill's PC! At this point; you may repeat from step 5 if you want another duplicate. If you are done, organize the pokemon(s) as you want (take the items from them, etc...) and then save the game.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the game is saved when you change box in Bill's PC, the changes in the box data is saved before the changes in the inventory data is saved. When you turn off the power as explained in this guide, the box data gets saved, while the inventory data is not saved and the previous data would not get overwritten.\n\n*Note on PkMn Crystal*\nThe saving routine in Pok\u00e9mon Crystal si somewhat different in therms of the one in Gold and Silver, and you should know that the delay between when the box data is saved and the inventory data is saved is a lot smaller. So, in step 5, you have to turn the power off a half to a whole second after the word \"POWER.\" appear on the screen (it sin't easy, and I suggest you should practice a coupple of times to get the right timing).\n\n*One Last Note*\nWhen doing this trick, do NEVER EVER withdraw a pokemon you want to keep just before step 5. If you do that, the pokemon withdrawed will be DELETED for good!", "title": "How to clone (duplicate) a Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Gold/Silver", "publishedDate": "2008-03-30T14:55:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTPODXu5jQc", "description": "''The Mirror  - Fear Of A Snak Planet'' (2010)\nDOWNLOAD NOW: http://SnakTheRipper.com\nFollow Snak The Ripper Here:\nhttp://Facebook.com/TheRealSnakTheRipper\nhttp://Twitter.com/SnakTheRipper", "title": "Snak The Ripper - The Mirror (Prod by Sixfire)", "publishedDate": "2011-01-03T04:38:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTPa_VNdw7I", "description": "Giant Panda (Ailuropoda Melanoleuca) 3D Model From CreativeCrash.com\nhttp://www.creativecrash.com/3d-model/giant-panda-ailuropoda-melanoleuca-3d-model\nThis model works in Maya, XSI, 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, Solidworks, Sketchup, Lightwave and any software that supports .3ds, .fbx and .obj.

He also had no-less than 7 single releases not to mention the launch of his new record label Extrema Global Music.\n\nFast forward to 2014 and the label is making huge waves on the scene and with a second artist album in full flow, Manuel now delivers the first Extrema Global Music Compilation.\n\nAs always, when Manuel flexes his DJ muscles the world sits up and listens and this compilation is further testament to that.\n\n15 tracks of pure unadulterated class including John Askew, Darren Porter, Estigma and Gary Maguire to name just a few.\n\nManuel's momentum on the world stage is building on a weekly basis.

Be safe instead of sorry with these tips for putting together a car emergency kit.\n\nGetting Started\nThere are a variety of reasons to have an emergency kit for your car or truck.\n\nThe contents of your emergency kit help you focus on your situation and make safe choices.\nIt keeps you prepared in case of a breakdown or flat tire when help isn't immediately available.\nAn emergency kit makes an extended stay in your vehicle safer and more comfortable\nBasic or Well-Stocked\nAn emergency kit for a car or truck can be as simple as a handful of flares, some bottled water and a flashlight, or as elaborate as a complete first aid kit, blankets, emergency supplies of special medicine and related items. However you choose to stock your kit, every emergency kit should include:\n\nRoad flares for warning oncoming traffic that your vehicle is stopped on the road\nReflective tape to increase your visibility at night\nA flashlight and spare batteries\nThe phone number of an emergency tow service\nThese items should be considered the bare minimum. A well-stocked emergency kit will also include:\n\nA container of antifreeze\nOne gallon of water\nA can of \"fix-a-flat\" spray to repair small leaks or punctures long enough to get you to a gas station\nTwo quarts of oil\nA large blanket\nSome non-perishable snacks\nWhen your car breaks down and you start looking at your emergency kit, the flares will remind you to stay visible to other drivers. The flashlight, antifreeze and water will remind you to check out your car or truck for problems and the tow truck number reminds you to call in for help.\n\nUsing Your Emergency Kit\nMost of the items on the list are for mechanical problems with your vehicle. An overheating radiator may need water from your gallon jug to get you to the next gas station. You may need to use antifreeze instead in extreme temperatures. The two quarts of oil are handy for vehicles which are dangerously low. The fix-a-flat aerosol will get you down the road, but you'll still need a new tire the first chance you get.\n\nBefore attempting to use any of the other items in your kit, get your flares out and place them in front of and behind your vehicle. Put them far enough away to warn drivers of your presence and give them time to slow down to avoid hitting you. Hundreds of roadside incidents happen in cities all over the country involving vehicles stopped on the side of the road. Give your fellow drivers plenty of early warning.\n\nWinter Weather Emergency Kits\nAnother item you should include in a cold weather emergency kit is a set of tire chains and a tow chain. The tire chains can be attached to your tires to help you get out of a snowdrift or a section of road that is filled with snow, ice and slush. If you don't have any traction to help you get unstuck, the tire chains can help. If you keep a tow chain in your trunk, any vehicle that has a ball hitch or tow bar can help pull your car or truck free. Otherwise you may have to wait until a tow truck arrives.\n\nOther Considerations\nIf you or someone who frequently travels with you has special medical needs, consider adding a supply of medicine to your emergency kit. Some medications, like insulin, are perishable and you can't store them in the car in the same way as allergy medications and some prescription drugs. If you are able to stash a small supply in your emergency kit, it's a very good idea to do so. Being stranded on the road means being cut off from the usual conveniences and necessities; be prepared for a worst-case scenario and you'll never regret the expense if you find yourself broken down on the side of the road.", "title": "Assembling Your Emergency Car Kit", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T19:53:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTV7sv-sS1s", "description": "The Constellations, a fantastic band from Atlanta came to Austin for the 2010 South By Southwest festival.

Celeste talks about what it feels like to work on Shakespeare at Ten Chimneys. This video also includes a clip of Celeste and the Fellows working on sonnets in the Drawing Room with Barry Edelstein.\n\n(Ten Chimneys, Genesee Depot, Wisconsin) On July 11, 2010, nine of the most respected and talented actors from across the United States formed the 2010 class of the Lunt-Fontanne Fellowship Program and embarked on a week of intensive study at Ten Chimneys, led by master teacher Barry Edelstein. \n\nThe Lunt-Fontanne Fellowship Program is a groundbreaking national program to serve regional theatre actors and the future of American theatre. The program, created by Ten Chimneys Foundation, is a fitting tribute to Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, who are widely regarded as the greatest acting couple in the history of the American theatre. Through this program, the top actors in the country are given a rare and deeply-needed opportunity to grow artistically, renew their passion for their art form, and deepen their commitment to mentorship. Ultimately, the program does not exist simply to serve actors; the purpose of the Lunt-Fontanne Fellowship Program is to strengthen the ability of actors and theatres to enrich people's lives in communities across the country. \n\n2010 Lunt-Fontanne Master Teacher, Barry Edelstein:\nWidely respected as one of the leading Shakespeareans in the United States, Barry Edelstein is the Director of The Public Theater's Shakespeare Initiative, overseeing all Shakespearean production at the theater, as well as The Public's extensive educational, community outreach, and artist-training programs.\n\nThe 2010 Lunt-Fontanne Fellows:\n\u2022 Stephen Berenson: Trinity Repertory Company (Providence)\n\u2022 James Carpenter: California Shakespeare Theater (Bay Area)\n\u2022 Celeste Ciulla: The Old Globe (San Diego)\n\u2022 Bob Davis: Guthrie Theater (Minneapolis)\n\u2022 Laura Gordon: Milwaukee Repertory Theater (Milwaukee)\n\u2022 Andrew Long: Shakespeare Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.)\n\u2022 Pete Pryor: The Wilma Theater (Philadelphia)\n\u2022 Jacqueline Williams: Goodman Theatre (Chicago)\n\u2022 Larry Yando: Chicago Shakespeare Theater (Chicago)\n\nMr. Edelstein and the 2010 Fellows dedicated their week of work to Inaugural LFFP Master Teacher, Lynn Redgrave (1943-2010).  \n\n2011 Lunt-Fontanne Fellowship Program:\nActress Olympia Dukakis, who is widely celebrated as one of the greatest American masters of interpreting and teaching the work of playwright Anton Chekov, will be the 2011 Master Teacher for the 2011 Lunt-Fontanne Fellowship Program. After two years of focusing on Shakespeare, the third weeklong retreat and master class at Ten Chimneys (July 24-31) will focus on Chekov.

Litigation lawyer Patrick Montoya has experience with finance and business litigation. \n\nTranscript:\n\nMany times people hear the term \"fiduciary duty,\" and they're not sure what it means. A fiduciary is somebody who is responsible for your funds or something that you've placed in their trust. A fiduciary duty is a trust relationship that's created between you and the fiduciary. The fiduciary has an obligation and a duty to make sure that your money is kept properly, that it's kept responsibly and that it's invested responsibly and not unwisely.\n For more information you can contact the firm at 305-476-7400.

In this video you'll learn:\n\n- About Allium bulbs\n- What you need to plant Allium bulbs\n- Where to plant allium bulbs\n- When to plant Allium bulbs\n-       Allium bulb Aftercare\n\n\nABOUT ALLIUM BULBS\n\nAlliums are nice and round, with a white skin, and should be firm, not soft and mushy.  Alliums look a little bit like onions, because they're related to onions.  Being related to the onion family, allium bulbs are deer resistant.  There are different Allium varieties such as the larger Allium Globemaster, medium sized Allium Mount Everest, and smaller Allium Drumstick.  Despite their varied sizes, all of these are mature healthy bulbs and, will all produce nice size flowers.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO PLANT ALLIUM BULBS\n\nTo get started you'll need a shovel, your choice of Allium bulbs, and a nice loose soil with some organic matter so it's easy to dig and work through it. \n\nWHERE TO PLANT ALLIUM BULBS\n\nYou can plant alliums in open borders in full sun or you can plant them in a shaded or partly shaded area, in a cutting border or in containers.  Alliums are very versatile and you can plant them virtually anywhere in your garden. \n\nWHEN TO PLANT ALLIUM BULBS\n\nYou will want to plant alliums in the Fall, in the month of November or October, but definitely before the ground freezes enabling the bulb to shoot roots and become established before the winter giving them a head start in Spring when they start to grow with the higher temperatures. \n\nHOW TO PLANT ALLIUM BULBS\n\nYou will want to plant alliums about six inches deep, as a rule of thumb, and an approximate distance of two to three bulbs in between.  The nicest thing to do is plant them in clumps of 3-5 bulbs.   \n\nALLIUM BULB AFTERCARE\n\nAfter planting your alliums you don't really need to do anything, only water them in if the soil is extremely dry, other than that they're maintenance free.\n\nCheck us out at www.longfield-gardens.com for all your Fall and Spring planted bulbs and perennials!!", "title": "How to Plant Allium Bulbs", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T18:07:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BTmvqlKKzXM", "description": "LIKE AND COMMENT!

Ebola HF is marked by blood clotting and hemorrhaging. Although it is not known exactly how the virus particles attack cells, it is postulated that one factor that allows them to do so is that they release proteins that dampen down the immune system response.\n\nThe Ebola virus attacks connective tissue multiplying rapidly in collagen. Collagen is the tissue that helps to keep the organs in place. The tissue is basically digested by this virus.\n\nThe Ebola virus causes small blood clots to form in the bloodstream of the patient; the blood thickens and the blood flow slows down. Blood clots get stuck into blood vessels forming red spots on the patient skin. These grow in size as the disease progress.

Simply a straight line through the center of the earth, since the two places are antipodes: they are located diametrically opposite to each other on the earth's surface. \n\nDuring his visits to four such antipodal pairs, the award-winning documentary filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky captured images that turn our view of the world upside down. A beautiful, peaceful sunset in Entre R\u00edos is contrasted with the bustling streets in rainy Shanghai. People who live in a wasteland are connected to people dwelling next to a volcano. Landscapes whose splendor touches the soul are juxtaposed with the clamor of a vast city. These antipodes seem mythically connected, somehow united by their oppositeness.

She is under a year of age. We bought her at Normanview. \n\nDescription of the bird: \n\nThe budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), (parakeet, shell parakeet, budgie, or common pet parakeet in US English) is a small parrot belonging to the tribe of the broad-tailed parrots (Platycercini); sometimes considered a subfamily (Platycercinae). It is the only species in the Australian genus Melopsittacus and sometimes isolated in a tribe of its own, the Melopsittacini, although it is probably quite closely related to Pezoporus and Neophema.[2] Though budgerigars are often, especially in American English, called Parakeets, this term refers to any of a number of small parrots with long flat tails. The budgerigar is found throughout the drier parts of Australia and has survived for the last five million years in the harsh inland conditions of that continent.[3]\n\nBudgerigars in their natural-habitats of Australia average 18 cm (7 in) long, weigh 30-40 grams, and display a light green body colour (abdomen and rumps), while their mantle (back and wing coverts) display pitch-black mantle markings (blackish in fledgelings and immatures) edged in clear yellow undulations. The forehead and face is yellow in adults but with blackish stripes down to the cere in young individuals until they change into their adult plumage around 3-4 months of age. They display small purple patches (called cheek patches) and a series of 3 black spots across each sides of their throats (called throat-spots) of which the 2 outermost throat-spots are situated at the base of each cheek-patches. The tail is cobalt (dark-blue); outside tail feathers display central yellow flashes. Their wings have greenish-black flight feathers and black coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes which only becomes visible in flight and/or when the wings are stretched. Bills are olive grey and legs blueish-grey, with zygodactyl toes.[14].\n\nBudgerigars in their natural-habitats of Australia are noticeably smaller than those in captivity. This particular parrot species has been bred in many other colours and shades in captivity (i.e. blue, grey, greygreen, pieds, violet, white, yellow...) although they are mostly found in pet stores in blue, green and yellow. Budgerigar plumage is known to fluoresce under ultraviolet light (as most other parrot species do as well), a phenomenon possibly related to courtship and mate selection.[15]\n\nThe colour of the cere (the area containing the nostrils) differs between the sexes; royal blue in males, pale-brown to white (non-breeding) or brown (breeding) in females and pink in immatures of both sexes (usually of a more even purplish-pink colour in young males). Some female budgerigars develop brown cere only during breeding time and it later disappears. Young females can often be identified by a subtle chalky whiteness that starts around the cere nostril holes. Males that are either Albino, Dark-Eyed-Clear, Lutino and/or recessive pied (aka Danishpied aka Harlequin) always retain the immature purplish-pink cere colour their entire life.[16][14]\n\nIt is usually easy to tell the sex of a Budgie over 6 months old, mainly by the cere colours but behaviours and head shape also help indicate Budgie's genders.\n\nMature males' ceres are usually light to dark blue but can be purplish to pink in some particular colour mutations (DarkEyedClears, Danishpieds aka Recessivepieds and Inos) and usually display much rounder heads. Males are typically cheerful, extroverted, highly flirtatious, most peacefully social and very vocal.\n\nFemales' ceres are pinkish as immatures and switch from being beigish or whitish outside breeding condition into brown (often with a 'crusty' texture) in breeding condition and usually display flattened back of heads (right above the nape region). Females are typically highly dominant and more socially intolerant. [17]\n\n\n\n[edit] Vision\nLike many birds, budgerigars have tetrachromatic colour vision, but all four classes of cone cells operating simultaneously requires the full spectrum provided by sunlight.[18] Additionally, budgerigars have been known to see in the ultra-violet spectrum, which brightens up their feathers to attract mates. The throat-spots in budgerigars have been most notable for reflecting UVs[15] and for identifying one bird from the other.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar", "title": "Edna the budgie - talking budgie ...  that hasn't spoken yet", "publishedDate": "2009-03-15T03:56:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BU33_D4nwqk", "description": "Tyde Levi shows you how to use the Student Edge App to find great deals near you.\nDownload the app for FREE here: http://studentedge.com.au/app \nMembership to Student Edge is also FREE.\nStudent Edge is the largest member-based organisation of high school and tertiary students in Australia.\nLike Tyde?

This makes him indispensable in collaring dangerous criminals, but a liability to any potential partners. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), a conservative family man who wants to stay alive for his upcoming 50th birthday, is partnered with Riggs. As Riggs gets to know Murtaugh and his family, he begins to mellow, though his insistence on using guerilla tactics to catch criminals is still (put mildly) above and beyond the call of duty. The main villain is The General (Mitchell Ryan), a drug dealer responsible for the death of the daughter of one of Murtaugh's oldest friends. The General is also in charge of a deadly, militia-like gang of smugglers. Adding fuel to the fire is The General's chief henchman, played with all stops out by Gary Busey. Moviegoers familiar only with the relatively tongue-in-cheek Lethal Weapon sequels may be amazed to find out how dangerous and unpredictable Riggs is in the first Lethal Weapon -- and how likely it seems that Murtaugh might not survive until fade-out time.\n\n\"lethal weapon\",\"lethal weapon clip\",\"lethal weapon 5\",\"lethal weapon full movie\",\"crime action\",\"sergeant martin riggs\",\"richard donner\",\"action adventure\",\"action thrillers\",\"helping videos\",\"building videos\",blockbusters,\"joel silver\",\"rooftop videos\",\"adversity videos\",\"risk videos\",\"mel gibson\",\"danny glover\",\"michael shaner\",\"handcuffs videos\",\"action comedies\",\"jennie lew tugend\",\"los angeles videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++29103,/m/0c1pj,/m/0205dx,/m/0bgbptw", "title": "Lethal Weapon (4/10) Movie CLIP - Do You Really Wanna Jump?
