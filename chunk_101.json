Molen, Walter F. Parkes, Ronald Shusett\nScreenwriter: Philip K. Dick, Scott Frank\nFilm Description: Based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, this science fiction-thriller reflects the writer's familiar preoccupation with themes of concealed identity and mind control. Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a Washington, D.C. detective in the year 2054. Anderton works for \"Precrime,\" a special unit of the police department that arrests murderers before they have committed the actual crime. Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who hired a team of futurists to devise the film's numerous technologically advanced gadgets, Minority Report co-stars Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Neal McDonough.\n\n\"minority report\",\"minority report clip\",\"minority report part 1\",\"minority report full movie\",\"tom cruise\",\"samantha morton\",\"mike binder\",\"steven spielberg\",\"gun videos\",\"window videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"walter f parkes\",\"gerald r molen\",\"michael doven\",\"jan de bont\",\"ronald shusett\",\"gary goldman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262610,/m/08jp1f,/m/07r1h,/m/02d42t", "title": "Minority Report (6/9) Movie CLIP - You're Supposed to Kill Me (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T23:43:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5M4vxeVjAxA", "description": "A major goal of estate planning is to avoid probate, when a court must remove one name from a legal deed and add another.

In his offspring he finds the grave limits he cannot admit in himself. And he will stop at nothing to make certain that his child continually tries to correct these flaws. In actuality, the child may be exceedingly intelligent, but has so fully developed feelings of ineptitude that he is incapable of believing in his own possibilities. The child's innate sense of self is in great jeopardy when this level of false labeling is accepted.

The SEALs duty is to conduct small-unit maritime military operations which originate from, and return to a river, ocean, swamp, delta or coastline. SEALs can negotiate shallow water areas such as the Persian Gulf coastline, where large ships and submarines are limited due to depth.\n\n\"SEAL\" is always capitalized in reference to members of the Naval Special Warfare community. The Navy SEALs are trained to operate in all environments (Sea, Air, and Land) for which they are named. SEALs are also prepared to operate in climate extremes of scorching desert, freezing Arctic, and humid jungle. The SEALs current pursuit of elusive, dangerous and high-priority terrorist targets has them operating in remote, mountainous regions of Afghanistan, and in cities torn by factional violence. Historically the SEALs have always had \"one foot in the water.\" The reality, however, today is that they initiate lethal direct action strikes equally well from air and land.\n\nAll SEALs are male members of the United States Navy. The CIA's highly secretive Special Activities Division (SAD) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group (SOG) recruits operators from the SEAL Teams. Joint Navy SEALs and CIA operations go back to the famed MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. This cooperation still exists today and is seen in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Due to their reputation as one of the world's premier special operations forces, SEAL operators routinely serve in allied SOF's including the British Special Air Service, Special Boat Service and Polish GROM.\n\nSWAT (acronym for \"Special Weapons And Tactics\") is a commonly used proper name for law enforcement units, which use military-style light weapons and specialized tactics in high-risk operations that fall outside of the capabilities of regular, uniformed police.[1] \"SWAT\" is commonly used internationally, as a colloquial, generic term for these units.\n\nTheir duties include: confronting heavily armed criminals; performing hostage rescue and counter-terrorism operations; high risk arrests; and entering armored or barricaded buildings. Such units are often equipped with specialized firearms including submachine guns, assault rifles, breaching shotguns, sniper rifles, riot control agents, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures.\n\nThe United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for land-based military operations. It is the largest and oldest established branch of the U.S. military, and is one of seven U.S. uniformed services. The modern army has its roots in the Continental Army which was formed on 14 June 1775, to meet the demands of the American Revolutionary War before the establishment of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation officially created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 after the end of the Revolutionary War to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The army considers itself to be descended from the Continental Army and thus dates its inception from the origins of that force.\n\nThe primary mission of the army is \"to fight and win our Nation\u2019s wars by providing prompt, sustained land dominance across the full range of military operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders.\" The army is a military service within the Department of the Army, one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The army is headed by the Secretary of the Army, and the top military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Army. The highest ranking army officer is currently the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During fiscal year 2011, the Regular Army reported a strength of 546,057 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG) reported 358,078 and the United States Army Reserve (USAR) reported 201,166 putting the combined component strength total at 1,105,301 soldiers.\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING!!!", "title": "LEGO Call of Duty: Navy Seals, Army, S.W.A.T.

Ovarian cysts as a subject have been on the minds of women for quite some time. Often they are not problematical, it just means everybody needs to know what a cyst is to be able to then avoid much of the worrying.\n\nOvarian Cyst and Ways of Management\n\nIn general it is wise to make a few comments about overall methods for ovarian cyst management. The first one is that for women who are not taking oral contraceptives, who have a cystic structure which is no bigger than the size of an apricot, who are still at a reproductive age, and who suffer no pain, then conventional medical tracking and treatment will be enough. Note that the pain might be a factor triggering necessary surgical intervention.\n\nSeptation may be seen in pathologic cysts, meaning the development of partitions of tissues. Different compartments of fluid can then be ascertained. Growths in the tissue may well also be developed in pathologic cysts, which then roughen the walls. Another name for these growths is excrescences. Doctors often use the technique of ultrasound in order to understand the situation of the cysts and to measure its dimensions precisely. However in physiologic cysts, neither septations nor excrescences are present. It is in the case of pathologic cysts that surgical operations may be required.", "title": "How to cure Ovarian Cysts Holistically", "publishedDate": "2012-08-19T15:13:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MGoJzwHnzY", "description": "Radial balance in two-dimensional design rotates around a center point.

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[3]\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[4]\nShakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.[5][nb 4] His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.\nMany of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.\nShakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \"bardolatry\".[6] In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.\n\nWilliam shakespeare honesty The Tempest Two Gentlemen of Verona Merry Wives Windsor Measure for Comedy Errors Much Ado About Nothing Midsummer Night's Dream Merchant Venice As You Like It Taming the Shrew All's Well That Ends Twelfth Night Winter's Tale Pericles Prince Tyre Noble Kinsmen Troilus and Cressida Coriolanus Titus Andronicus Romeo Juliet Timon Athens Julius Caesar Macbeth Hamlet King Lear Othello Antony Cleopatra Cymbeline Love's Labour's Lost Richard III John Richard II King lear\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin.[118] Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,[119] the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.[120] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.[121] The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission", "title": "William shakespeare \" A fool ...\" is the quote of the day.", "publishedDate": "2011-11-13T17:05:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MQNz6SWOV0", "description": "muscular rheumatism information\nmuscular rheumatism medical\nmeaning of muscular rheumatism", "title": "muscular rheumatism medical", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T18:34:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MQsMvlD7OQ", "description": "http://www.freemathvideos.com In this video series I will show you how to simplify trigonometric expressions.

Now you have to take what is in your hands and pat on the face. Then gently massage the cream or gel into the skin. Go slowly and do not rub hard. Allow product to absorb into your skin in a natural way. All you have to do is move and allow your skin to absorb it. Be thorough. This should take a few minutes. If it does not, or you're going to fast or do not use enough cream or gel. benzoyl peroxide acne\n\nSince benzoyl peroxide is a peeling agent, after application, you must also apply a moisturizer. The moisturizer should be applied using the same steps as in the previous step. The only difference is that you do not need as much moisturizer.benzoyl peroxide acne A jet of a bottle of the pump should be about right. \n\nIt will probably take a few weeks for your skin to get used to this treatment. Once the skin is able to tolerate the full benzoyl peroxide acne  dose of benzoyl peroxide, you should start to see good results.

A person could accuse a healthcare professional or researcher of trespass or assault if the person did not give their consent or if their consent was not voluntary. If the person is not sufficiently informed of the possible consequences of their decision and they suffer as a result, they could accuse the healthcare professional or researcher of negligence. Therefore, through the UK common law and healthcare legislation, informed consent is a requirement in most treatment and research settings. However, consent goes beyond legitimising actions that would otherwise be unlawful.\n\nThere are differing opinions about the strong reliance now placed on informed consent. In treatment settings, is it ever possible to inform someone sufficiently on the complexities of a surgical procedure or a treatment regime so that a person really understands the implications of their decision?\n\nI must know everything about what I can expect before I can make a decision.\n\nThis information is too complex and too confusing to understand. Ill do what the doctor wants. Theyre the expert.\n\nSome people, when faced with complex descriptions or multiple pages of information to join a clinical trial, simply sign consent forms without properly reading or trying to understand the information.\n\nI want all the information available on this procedure so that I will understand what will happen.\n\nIm not interested in reading all this information so Ill just sign the paper.\n\nSome argue that requiring informed consent to use some types of personal information, such as medical records, hinders research by placing more weight on protecting the privacy of the individual over enabling research for the benefit of society.\n\nI must be asked for my consent for all uses of my healthcare information or its a breach of my privacy.\n\n\" We cant ask everyone for their consent; its too expensive and time-consuming. But without this research we wont know how safe and effective this treatment is.\n\nBalancing these opposing views is difficult. Regardless, informed consent is a central part of the interaction between a healthcare professional or researcher and an individual and is seen as one of the core fundamentals in the ethical conduct of treatment and research.", "title": "Informed Consent - The Need For Informed Consent", "publishedDate": "2008-10-08T11:12:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MTNiWUtpTs", "description": "http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/finegrain/bowden-sheffield-minimalist-ipad-cases", "title": "Finegrain: Loading and Unloading", "publishedDate": "2012-05-11T04:22:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MTVpdvLd-g", "description": "The cardinal flower, or lobelia cardinalis, is a flower that is native to the eastern part of the United States.

Read on if you dare.\n\nGreetings once again all and thank you for all your comments, likes, favorites, and such on all of my videos while I was away.  I haven't been able to check in on this account for a few months so if you have sent me an email or response and haven't heard back I apologize for not being able to answer them, something I will try to make up for in the following week.\n\nAlright... info on the video itself... Man, you guys, I wanted to RAGE QUIT this video so many times. SO MANY.  Right out the gate I had issues getting the sound portion in an acceptable state.  Once I made the choice to apply custom sounds to the sound-free music version, I struggled something fierce trying to find all the sounds I needed to make it work.  You'd be surprised how hard it is to find the proper sound effects that aren't covered by background noise.\n\nMy initial concepts for the video altered pretty greatly from what the version you see here turned out.  Sweetie Bell (or the tiny monkey in the actual game) was originally going to be Spike, but after the Sisterhooves Social episode, I couldn't help myself (and yeah, that probably gives you an idea how long this video was in gestation for). \n\nIn keeping with the original game, I was desperately searching for that grunting noise the big, mandrill monkey made, but every instance of that was covered with background noise, and the Diamond Dog never made any such sound to make up for it, so in my search to found an adequate replacement, I ran into Rarity's \"Wah-hah-HA!\" and it instantly seemed like the most obvious thing ever.\n\nIn the game, the ball does not always bounce directly on the pole, it'll land and spin on the ground before hitting it.  I originally plotted it to where there was a funnel where the hole would be, making it not possible for the ball/gem to \"roll\" in there, so I finished the sound portion of the video with that in mind (also the \"rolling\" sound effect from the game was also too covered in BG noise to properly extract).  During the animation part, I realized that was kind of dumb looking so I changed it back to just a normal hole, but it was too late to change the sounds to reinstate the rolling gem/balls.  So if you were wondering why the game and this don't match up exactly, that'd be why. \n\nTwo other things I wanted to include but didn't- \n\nA scene with Diamond Jake and... Diamond Boss(?) setting up *WHY* Rarity is golfing gems into a hole instead of just their still pictures during that \"Meanwhile\" screen.\n\nRainbow Dash bouncing a ball in time with the music in the background to serve the same purpose Twilight did in the Peckish Pony video.\n\nThis video was simply taking too long to get out of the gate and I decided it was for the best to cut those out just so I didn't actually rage quit and give up on it mid-way through.\n\nAnd that'd about the gist of it I guess.  I think I am done with the Rhythm Heaven + Pony videos.  Thanks to everyone who wanted ACTUAL game versions of these things but I think if I look at any of these flash files for a minute longer I'm going to go crazy.  You are welcome to make those Step Mania type of dealies and use these sound tracks for other such shenanigans, but I have no plans to further elaborate on any of these save for maybe HD versions of the videos for when I get the equipment that would allow me to do so.\n\nThat's not to say I'm done making ANY videos.  Oddly enough, the thing I want to make the most next is a full, 11ish minute EPISODE, written, animated, and voice acted all from scratch (yeah, as if the 1 to 3 minute ones weren't bad enough right..?).  Part of me also kind of wants to do some minor streaming in order to show off the inner workings of these current videos and give some pointers to the Flash animators in training out there, but I dunno where'd I'd even start with that.\n\nAnyway, I need a bit of a breather and have some UMvC3 (Xbox) I got for Xmas but haven't had the time to play yet.

I can just go home and watch the game.  A\nnd so, knowing that you lead a finite life creates a certain urgency to the minutes that you live that I value greatly.  I don't know what would mean if we live forever or live a really long time.  I don't know what would mean for my focus.  Maybe it's, you have to be careful what you wish for here.  They would live a long time, people become less productive than they do when they don't live very long at all.\nI think of the mayfly that live no more than 24 hours. What is life like to them?  They will never see a sun rise if they're born in the daytime.  The things that we take for granted that they never see.  So every minute of their life, it's a wall.  It's a ceiling.  It's a moon.  It's a grass.  Everything is this life experience that's captured and presumably valued in their little brain.\nSo, I like to take my 75 years on this planet and be like the mayfly, thinking they're only living for a day and just take it all in.\n\u00a0\nRecorded on: February 9, 2009", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: Living and Longevity", "publishedDate": "2011-06-03T16:13:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MelvsXn47g", "description": "Download this and more at http://www.ignitemotion.com", "title": "Bats Animation", "publishedDate": "2011-10-28T14:20:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Mes1uCjYJk", "description": "Violent Gentlemen presents with Movember.com the\nMasters of Moustachery!

It begins with a bundle of factors assembling at the start of a gene. A gene is simply a length of DNA instructions stretching away to the left. The assembled factors trigger the first phase of the process, reading off the information that will be needed to make the protein. Everything is ready to roll: three, two, one, GO! The blue molecule racing along the DNA is reading the gene. It's unzipping the double helix, and copying one of the two strands. The yellow chain snaking out of the top is a copy of the genetic message and it's made of a close chemical cousin of DNA called RNA. The building blocks to make the RNA enter through an intake hole. They are matched to the DNA - letter by letter - to copy the As, Cs, Ts and Gs of the gene. The only difference is that in the RNA copy, the letter T is replaced with a closely related building block known as \"U\". You are watching this process - called transcription - in real time. It's happening right now in almost every cell in your body.", "title": "DNA Transcription (Basic)", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T18:52:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MfcsCyHbYI", "description": "Illumitex LED Grow light bars like these and fixtures utilizing Illumitex Horticultural LED's are available from http://diamond-grow-lights.com so please check out our website and get yours today!\n\nIllumitex provided 100% of the LED lighting in this vertical farm.

The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by some) as the successors of Peter, he being the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance in the Catholic Church. After the Sack of Rome in 410 AD by Alaric I and the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome alternated between Byzantine and Germanic control. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 during the Early Middle Ages,reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens. Rome remained nominally part of the Byzantine Empire until 751 AD, when the Lombards finally extinguished the Exarchate of Ravenna which was the last holdout of the Byzantines in northern Italy. In 756, Pepin the Short gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over Rome and surrounding areas, thus creating the Papal States. In 846, Muslim Arabs stormed the city and managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.\n \nRome remained the capital of the Papal States until its annexation by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870; the city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire starting with Charlemagne, who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by Pope Leo III. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and \"holy city\" for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309--1377).\nSource: wikipedia.org\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "title": "Rome, Italy 3, Collage Video - youtube.com/tanvideo11", "publishedDate": "2014-01-19T19:46:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Mqd87CjqD0", "description": "Custom built Padauk wood T-style guitar\n\nSorry about the lousy playing and the bright orange shirt...", "title": "Padauk T-Syle Guitar #1", "publishedDate": "2010-06-23T16:52:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MqvWd_7jto", "description": "", "title": "Prof.Dr.Dil\u015fad T\u00dcRKDO\u011eAN / SSPE ATV De\u015fifre Program\u0131- Temmuz 2009", "publishedDate": "2013-02-20T10:07:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5MqvqVU-4DA", "description": "The first tenants are moving in to the One World Trade Center -- 13 years and 7 weeks after the 9/11 attacks.

So, this is going to be me breathing to my right side. Pull, take a breath, face goes right back in, pull with your left arm, your face stays in the water.

Maurer S\u00f6hne expected the attraction to carry approximately 1,850 riders per hour.\nIn the attraction's queue line, video monitors entertain waiting guests. The programming is hosted by characters who introduce one of Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit's signature components, its customizable soundtrack. Guests select a musical track from one of five genres\u2014classic rock/metal, rap/hip-hop, country, pop/disco and club/electronica\u2014to hear during their experience. Each genre has six songs available, bringing a total of 30 different tunes to the ride's on-board library. The songs will not be re-arranged to fit the roller coaster's design; however, the musical artists granted the ride's designers the ability to select when their songs started and stopped, in order to provide the best match to the ride.\nDuring the development process, Universal officials surveyed guests to determine which songs should be made available on the attraction. Some of the songs considered included \"Gone Country\" by Alan Jackson, \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" by Judas Priest, \"All I Wanna Do\" by Sheryl Crow, \"Pump It\" by The Black Eyed Peas and \"Staying Alive\" by The BeeGees. Other artists whose songs were considered included The Beach Boys, Three Six Mafia and Johnny Cash. Universal officials are able to track the popularity of the selected songs, and have stated that special songs may be added from time to time.\nThe \"choose-your-own-soundtrack\" feature is similar to that on another Universal-owned roller coaster, Hollywood Dream: The Ride at sister park Universal Studios Japan. Taking this customization a step further, the ride experience will be filmed, allowing guests to obtain a digital copy of the film, complete with their chosen soundtrack, to add to their webpages or video-sharing sites, such as YouTube. The on-board cameras were designed to withstand a wide range of mechanical and environmental stresses.\n\n\nA ride vehicle for \"Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit\", traversing the first \"loop\" element. The vehicle uses Maurer S\u00f6hne's X-Car Coaster design.\nThe trains consist of two cars, with each car carrying six riders in three rows of two. The seats in each car are arranged in a stadium seating configuration, affording each seat a better view of the ride. Located in the safety restraint of each seat is a touch screen that is used to select the desired music for the ride. The speakers are located within the headrest of the seat, and have been designed such that only the rider's selected music track will be audible. Further, the rails and support columns are filled with sand and pea gravel, reducing the amount of ambient noise generated by the roller coaster.\nThe coloration and lighting of the ride track was selected to enhance the ride experience and to minimize the visibility of the track's support columns. The ride vehicles themselves feature color-changing LEDs for a dynamic appearance. Each train has its own display pattern, which itself will change as it passes through each major section of the ride's layout.\nHollywood Rip Ride Rockit includes a number of safety features. Unlike many modern steel roller coasters, its seats do not use over-the-shoulder harnesses; instead, there is a large padded lap bar. Louis Alfieri, the attraction's creative director, said, \"the entire seat assembly is ergonomically designed so you're completely sandwiched and locked into the seat.\" Due to the lift hill's vertical construction, the ride provides a custom-designed evacuation system in the event a train become disabled.", "title": "Universal Hollywood Rip, Ride, Rockit (HD POV Front) Universal Studios Florida Roller Coaster", "publishedDate": "2011-06-24T03:44:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5NQgn5TjOkk", "description": "Bem, fiz mais uma musica tentar ser o Bob Dylan e a falhar redondamente, espero que n\u00e3o odeiem, mas se odiarem eu vou ter de aprender a viver com isso.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell, I've sung another song trying to be Bob Dylan and failled.

What's the best dosage? Many patients find melatonin helpful for falling asleep. I do not find melatonin helpful for patients who use it to stay asleep or who wake up multiple times during the night. Many melatonin supplements on the market are sold in 1-3mg pills. However some people experience a side effect of fatigue or grogginess in the morning after taking too high a dosage of melatonin.\n\nIt is more natural to take a smaller dose of melatonin such as 0.5mg and to take it it anywhere from sunset to 2-3 hours before bed. This gives the melatonin time to work into the natural circadian rhythm to get the body ready to calm down for bed. It is more supportive of the natural clock rather than giving a large dose right before bed. After using melatonin to train your body clock as well as developing more consistent sleep cycles, it's best to allow the body to go on it's natural cycle rather than taking melatonin for sleep indefinitely. \n\nFor the Pure Encapsulations 0.5mg melatonin, you can get it here:\nhttp://modernintegrativemedicine.com/supplement-store/\nClick on Emerson Ecologics \n\nFor other great resources: \nhttp://www.moernintegrativemedicine.com\n\nMelatonin Dosage & Sleep - National Sleep Foundation\nhttp://sleepfoundation.org/sleep.../melatonin-and-sle...\nNational Sleep Foundation\nLearn about the proper Melatonin Dosage for healthy sleep.

In responding to the scale, respondents are asked to indicate how often they experienced any of these 43 events during a certain time period (typically, the past year). The person the adds up the numbers associated with each event checked. ##\n\n(2)The SRRS and similar scales have been used in thousands of studies by researchers all over the world. ### Overall, these studies have shown that people with higher scores on the SRRS tend to be more vulnerable to many kinds of physical illness and many types of psychological problems as well. #### More recently, however, experts have criticized this research, citing problems with methods used and raising questions about the meaning of the findings. \n\n(3) First, the assumption that the SRRS measures change exclusively has been shown to be inaccurate. We now have ample evidence that the desirability of events affects adaptational outcomes more than the amount of change that //they// require. Thus, it seems prudent to view the SRRS as a measure of //diverse//forms of stress, rather than as a measure of change-related stress. \n\n(4)Second, the SRRS fails to take into account differences among people in their subjective perception of how stressful an event is. For instance, while divorce may deserve a stress value of 73 for most people, a particular person;s divorce might generate much less stress and merit a value of only 25. \n\n(5) Third, many of the events listed in the SRRS and similar scales are highly ambiguous, leading people to be inconsistent as to which events they report experiencing. For instance, what qualifies as \"trouble with the boss\"? Should you check that because you're sick and tired of your supervisor? What constitutes a \"change in living conditions\"? Does your purchase of a great new sound system qualify? As you can see, the SRRS includes many \"events\" that are described inadequately, producing considerable ambiguity about the meaning of one's response. Problems in recalling events over a period of a year also lead to inconsistent responding on stress scales, thus lowering their reliability. \n\n(6)Fourth, The SRRS does not sample from the domain of stressful events very thoroughly. Do the 43 events listed on the SRRS exhaust all the major stresses that people typically experience? Studies designed to explore that question have found many significant omissions.\n\n(7) Fifth, the correlation between SRRS scores and health outcomes may be inflated because subjects' neuroticism affects both their responses to stress scales and their self reports of health problems. Neurotic individuals have a tendency to recall more stress than others and to recall more symptoms of illness than others. These tendencies mean that some of the correlation between high stress and high illness may simply reflect the effects of subjects' neuroticism. The possible contaminating effects of neuroticism obscure the meaning of scores on the SRRS and similar measures of stress. \n\nThe Life Experience Survey\n\n(8) In the light of these problems, a number of researchers have attempted to develop improved versions of the SRRS. For example, the Life Experiences Survey (LES), //assembled// by Irwin Sarason and colleagues, has become a widely used measure of stress on contemporary research. The LES revises and builds on the SRRS survey in a variety of ways that correct, at least in part, most of the problems just discussed. \n\n(9) Specifically, the LES recognizes that stress involves more than mere change and asks respondents to indicate whether events have a positive or negative impact on them. This strategy permits the computation of positive change, negative change, and total change scores, which helps researchers gain much more insights into which facets of stress are most crucial. The LES also takes into consideration differences among people in their appraisal of stress, by dropping the normative weights and replacing them with personally assigned weightings of the impact of //relevant// events. Ambiguity in items is decreased by providing more elaborate descriptions of many items to clarify their meaning. \n\nThe LES deals with the failure of the SRRS to sample the full domain of stressful events in several ways. First, some significant omissions from the SRRS have been added to the LES. Second, the LES allows the respondent to write in personally important events that are not included on the scale. Third, the LES has an extra section just for the students. Sarason and colleagues suggest that special, tailored sections of this sort be added for specific populations whenever it is useful.", "title": "TOEFL Reading test 1.3", "publishedDate": "2013-11-06T07:57:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5NcD4SqiwHA", "description": "Join us for two weeks of new, exclusive classes in an interactive, online event.

Now, we'll put a rag under the filter to try and keep the mess down, take your filter pliers, break the filter loose, and remove it.\n\nChris: Okay, now you want to put a little oil or grease on the new O-ring, and spin the filter on hand-tight. The final step is going to be filling the motor with oil and checking the level. We have the oil changed and checked it and it's at the proper level, now we're ready to roll.\n\nLenny: Hey, let me ask you something. An oil change is not an incredibly complex procedure, but if you mess it up, you pay big time, don't you?\nChris: Yes, the consequences are pretty severe.\n\nLenny: So how does someone know if they should try this job or not?\n\nChris: Well, if they have a mechanical background and it's something they feel comfortable with, and they've done it on other things, they probably would be OK.\n\nLenny: Otherwise, we hope you take it in.", "title": "How to Change Engine Oil on Four-Stroke Outboard", "publishedDate": "2013-04-21T10:00:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5NczyGuRnl8", "description": "http://www.pedalsandeffects.com/boss-cs-2-my-number-one-pedal\nI have used the Boss CS-2 compressor/sustainer since Racer X.

Vitiligine cura definitiva 2014. Una malattia che causa macchie bianche sulla pelle\n\nVitiligine, altrimenti noto come \"Leukoderma\", \u00e8 una condizione della pelle in cui vi \u00e8 una graduale perdita della colorazione pigmentazione. Questa perdita di colore, o de-pigmentazione, si traduce in un sbiancamento della pelle a chiazze, spesso di piccole dimensioni per cominciare. \n\nQuesta condizione, purtroppo, rimarr\u00e0 con la persona per la vita. Attualmente non esiste farmaco che trattare questa condizione e fornire una cura al 100%. Non tutto \u00e8 perduto anche se, come c'\u00e8 speranza in forma di trattamenti alternativi. C'\u00e8 qualche buona notizia, almeno, ci sono varie terapie e trattamenti che possono, e sono stati mostrati, per rallentare la condizione di de-pigmentazione e ridurre la perdita di colore della pelle. Uno dei pi\u00f9 comuni di questi trattamenti \u00e8 Fotografico UV Therapy.\n\nUV Fototerapia dovrebbe essere intrapreso solo sotto controllo medico professionale. Se UV Fototerapia non viene eseguita correttamente, \u00e8 possibile che esso pu\u00f2 peggiorare la condizione e che pi\u00f9 de-pigmentazione si diffonder\u00e0. Apparecchi da fototerapia UV Cliniche e ospedali sono specializzati in grado di fornire questo trattamento.\n\nUna parola di avvertimento: trattamento UV deve essere sorvegliato. Questo non significa che una persona che soffre di vitiligine si deve esporre al UV naturale della luce solare pi\u00f9 di chiunque altro. Se dovete andare fuori al sole, allora si ha bisogno di proteggere le zone colpite con vestiti e creme solari o.\n\nSi deve solo rischiare lunga esposizione al sole se davvero necessario e utilizzare sempre una crema solare con un alto SPF. In caso contrario, stare lontano dalla luce diretta del sole a tutti i costi. La luce UV del sole pu\u00f2 peggiorare la condizione cos\u00ec come guarire. Il tasso di diffusione delle aree de-pigmentati o patch potrebbe aumentare se l'esposizione non-sorvegliato a luce UV \u00e8 consentito e la condizione pu\u00f2 peggiorare nel tempo.\n\nUn'altra opzione per il trattamento di aree di vitiligine che stanno causando un problema \u00e8 quello di guardare innesti di pelle. Questa \u00e8 una misura estrema come potrebbe essere considerato come la chirurgia invasiva. Parlare con nessuno che \u00e8 stato attraverso un innesto cutaneo e generalmente dir\u00e0 che \u00e8 un'esperienza dolorosa.\n\nIl trapianto aree di pelle da una parte del corpo ad un altro \u00e8 una procedura chirurgica e realmente dovrebbe essere considerato una misura estrema. Va notato che la vitiligine non nella sua auto causa problemi fisici come il dolore o disagio.

The middle school team played Thursday at 5 p.m., just hours after the ruling, and Kountze cheerleaders held up a religious-oriented, run-through sign as the team took the field.Attorney David Starnes filed court papers at about noon seeking\u00a0the\u00a0Temporary Restraining Order against the Kountze ISD on behalf of cheerleaders who believe they have the right to place religious messages on run-through signs at football games.Starnes told KFDM News the signs \"weren't made on school time, weren't made using school funds and were done without any involvement of the school administration.\" His goal is to enable the signs to be displayed at Thursday night's middle school football game in Kountze.Superintendent Kevin Weldon told KFDM News someone complained to the district about the signs. He spoke with the district's legal counsel, and the Texas Association of School boards, and says he was told that according to a Supreme Court Decision, allowing religious scripture on run-through signs before games would violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.Weldon issued the ban Tuesday, preventing any student group from displaying religious signs or messages at school-sponsored events The reasoning is based on a Supreme Court ruling involving the Sante Fe ISD in Southeast Texas, in which the Court, by a 6-3 vote, held that a policy allowing student led prayer at football games was unconstitutional. The majority opinion, written by Justice Stevens, held that pre-game prayers delivered \"on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer\" are not private, but public speech. The majority opinion held that \"Regardless of the listener's support for, or objection to, the message, an objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school's seal of approval.\"A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice Rehnquist and\u00a0joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote that\u00a0the majority opinion \"bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life\". Rehnquist also wrote that the speech in question would be private, chosen and delivered by the speaker, rather than public, school-sponsored speech.Staff and sponsors of student groups in Kountze learned of the ban on Tuesday.It didn't take long for word to get out to the community of several thousand people.Cheerleaders, football players and parents say they feel the support.Parents in the city of about 2,000 created a Facebook fan page in support of the kids.It received about 30,000 'likes' in a little more than 24 hours.You can find them by going to Facebook and typing \"support Kountze kids faith.\"KFDM News contacted a member of the Texas State Board of Education from Beaumont for his reaction to the ban.Republican David Bradley says he strongly disagrees with the prohibition on religious signs.The Liberty Institute is investigating. It calls the ban \"censorship\" and released a statement that \"government schools will never learn students' religious rights are protected.\"In a news release, Liberty Institute President Kelly Shackelford said, \"These government school officials will never learn that students' religious rights are protected. We have successfully passed state laws protecting student religious speech and have won restraining orders to final judgments protecting student religious speech.\" The Liberty Institute says it's a nonprofit legal group dedicated to defending and restoring religious liberty across America - in schools, churches and throughout the public arena. Liberty says its vision is to reestablish religious liberty in accordance with the principles of the Founding Fathers.", "title": "Update: Judge grants TRO to opponents of Kountze religious sign ban", "publishedDate": "2012-10-16T23:06:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5NxknIHX4u0", "description": "Get Cooking Tips on How to Shred Russet Potatoes.

Look at his concentration!\n\n\"Gray langurs or Hanuman langurs, the most widespread langurs of South Asia, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting the entirety of the genus Semnopithecus. All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas\"\n\nSource - Wikipedia.\n\nThe Sariska Tiger Reserve is an Indian national park located in the Alwar district of the state of Rajasthan. The topography of Sariska supports scrub-thorn arid forests, dry deciduous forests, rocks and grasses. This area was a hunting preserve of the erstwhile Alwar state and it was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. In 1978, it was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger scheme. The present area of the park is 866 km\u00b2. The park is situated 107 km from Jaipur and 200 km from Delhi.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Estos huesos se conectan con varios huesos peque\u00f1os de la mu\u00f1eca que a su vez se conectan con los peque\u00f1os huesos de los dedos y el pulgar (figura 1). Varios m\u00fasculos que controlan el movimiento del pulgar se originan a partir de la parte posterior del antebrazo (radio y c\u00fabito). Dos de estos m\u00fasculos son conocidos como los extensores brevis del pulgar y abductor largo del pulgar y conecte al pulgar a trav\u00e9s de sus respectivos tendones (figura 2). Los tendones de estos m\u00fasculos cruzan el aspecto posterior / exterior de la mu\u00f1eca para adjuntar a los huesos del pulgar en el aspecto exterior de la espalda y el pulgar. Los tendones se encuentran en estrecha proximidad a una prominencia \u00f3sea o protuberancia en el lado del pulgar de la mu\u00f1eca. En general, estos dos m\u00fasculos son responsables de tomar el pulgar hacia atr\u00e1s o hacia fuera de los otros dedos. Tambi\u00e9n colaboran con la actividad de agarre y el uso general del pulgar.\nDurante la contracci\u00f3n de estos m\u00fasculos del pulgar, la tensi\u00f3n se coloca a trav\u00e9s de sus respectivos tendones. Adem\u00e1s, los tendones pueden frotar contra la prominencia \u00f3sea situada en el lado del pulgar de la mu\u00f1eca. Cuando estas fuerzas son excesivas, debido a un exceso de repetici\u00f3n o de alta fuerza, da\u00f1o en los tendones pueden ocurrir. De Quervain tendinitis es una condici\u00f3n por la cual hay un da\u00f1o, con la consiguiente inflamaci\u00f3n y la degeneraci\u00f3n de uno o m\u00e1s tendones en el aspecto posterior / exterior del pulgar. Esto suele ser debido al desgaste gradual y desgaste asociado con el uso excesivo y puede afectar a los extensores brevis del pulgar y / o el abductor largo del pulgar del tend\u00f3n. Ocasionalmente puede producirse traum\u00e1tica debido a un incidente espec\u00edfico.\nCausas de De Quervain tendinitis\nDe Quervain tendinitis ocurre m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente debido a actividades repetitivas o prolongada la colocaci\u00f3n de la tensi\u00f3n en los tendones en el aspecto posterior / exterior del pulgar. Estas actividades pueden incluir deportes como el golf, deportes de raqueta, bolera, el remo o el pirag\u00fcismo, as\u00ed como trabajos manuales, como carpinter\u00eda, pintura, cortar madera, alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, uso repetitivo de un martillo o un destornillador, el uso de maquinaria vibrante , coser y tejer, escribir o trabajar en la computadora. De Quervain tendinitis tambi\u00e9n puede ocurrir por otras actividades que impliquen fuerza o repetitivos de agarre de la mano y el pulgar.\nEs com\u00fan que los pacientes desarrollan esta condici\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de un incremento repentino en la actividad que pone la tensi\u00f3n en los tendones del pulgar o debido a un cambio en estas actividades. Ocasionalmente, De Quervain tendinitis puede desarrollar s\u00fabitamente. Esto puede ser debido a un golpe directo en la parte posterior del pulgar y la mu\u00f1eca, una ca\u00edda o debido a un movimiento forzado con manipulaci\u00f3n de objetos pesados \u200b\u200bo una fuerza de agarre a trav\u00e9s de los tendones del pulgar. Una historia de pulgar, la mu\u00f1eca, el codo, el hombro, el cuello o la parte superior lesi\u00f3n en la espalda puede aumentar la probabilidad de un paciente de desarrollar esta afecci\u00f3n.\nLos signos y s\u00edntomas de De Quervain tendinitis", "title": "C\u00f3mo \"NO\" estirar en caso de tendinitis de Quervain o del pulgar.", "publishedDate": "2013-05-27T06:19:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OUXmJYdNhw", "description": "110-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u0443\u0431\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430. \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u043a\u043e \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430. \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c. 110.

In the background, other fire crews and officers can be seen tending to the victims of the rollover accident.\n\nThe firefighter, who's been with the fire department for 12 1/2 years, was detained in the back of a CHP vehicle for about half an hour before being released.\n\nCHP has not released the officer name or if he has or has not been reprimanded for the incident. \nThe driver of a white Honda Civic involved in the crash was transported to the hospital. No word on the condition of the second driver.\nRepresentatives from the CHP and Chula Vista Fire Department met Wednesday to discuss the details of this incident. Wednesday afternoon, the two agencies released the following joint statement:\n\"Last night there was an unfortunate incident at the scene of a traffic collision on I-805, where both our agencies had responded. Both the CHP and the Chula Vista Fire Department share a common goal of protecting the public and providing the highest level of safety to responding emergency personnel, involved parties and other drivers at collision scenes.\n\nBoth of our agencies have the utmost respect for each other and our respective missions. This was an isolated incident and not representative of the manner in which our agencies normally work together toward our common goal. \n\nThis morning representatives from both agencies met to discuss the incident to improve communication and ensure the highest level of service is provided to the public. This incident will be a topic of future joint training sessions, in an ongoing effort to work more efficiently together.\"\n\nAccording to Hanneman, crews at an emergency scene usually use a method of working together called an incident command system.\n\nCBS News 8's Phil Constantine, who worked with the CHP for 20 years, watched the video and shared his thoughts.\n\"That is legal -- you can tell someone to move the vehicle. Whether it's justified, I can't comment on,\" Constantine said.\nHe says this has been an ongoing issue for years, in part because there are no rules, just guidelines about working together at a scene.\n\n\"Basically you have to do what is reasonable and prudent,\" Constantine said.\n\nHanneman stands by his crew, saying while the agencies are working together to find a resolution, nothing on his end will change.\n\n\"My engineers and all the crews did exactly what they're trained to do,\" he said.\n\nCBS News 8 spoke to the President for Local IAFF 2180 John Hess on the phone and says Gregoire did the right thing. \n\n\"I'm very proud of Jacob. He did a good job,\" said Hess. \"He made all firefighters look good. He was there to protect the citizens and he was willing to take a stand to do that.\" \n\nThis isn't the first time a firefighter has been detained. In 2010 a Montecito Battalion Chief in Santa Barbara County was handcuffed when he refused CHP orders to move a fire truck blocking lanes of traffic while responding to a crash. \n\nIn 2003, a police officer arrested a firefighter in Missouri for a similar reason and he sued. A jury in federal civil court awarded the firefighter with more than $17,000. \n\nIn Chula Vista, Hess says this issue between the Chula Vista Fire Department and CHP has come up before and officers have made threats but not arrests or handcuffing a firefighter until Tuesday night.  \n\n\"I truly believe in my heart that this is going to get solved and that the commissioner is going to get involved and this is going to get fixed,\" said Hess. \n\nLocal IAFF released this e-mail statement: \n\n\"On the evening of February 4, 2014 an officer of the California Highway Patrol arrested an on duty Chula Vista Fire Engineer in full turnouts and helmet while the Engineer was rendering medical aid to the victims of a roll-over accident on the south bound 805Freeway.

O primeiro a utilizar a defini\u00e7\u00e3o atual \u03c0 =3.14154613 foi o matem\u00e1tico gal\u00eas William Jones e os primeiros a utilizar como uma defini\u00e7\u00e3o de \u03c0 para medir o tamanho do universo foram os m\u00fasicos da banda curitibana Pineia, que desde o ano de 2008 v\u00eam travando uma batalha contra si mesma e contra tudo que se chama de verdade. Com forte liga\u00e7\u00e3o com a matem\u00e1tica, filosofia, cinema e literatura, a banda criou o neologismo Pineia, para determinar uma forte paran\u00f3ia pela letra \u03c0, o anti-padr\u00e3o universal. Na busca pela pira perfeita n\u00e3o resistiram \u00e0s provoca\u00e7\u00f5es da misteriosa Grande Gl\u00e2ndula Pineal que transmentiu que Pi era muito maior que um s\u00edmbolo, levando todos a loucura. As m\u00fasicas da Pineia s\u00e3o uma mistura de p\u00f3lvora com imagens, incluindo muitas guitarras pesadas, pianos, gaitas e agressividade. Formada por Red Dress Novak nos vocais, Wol de Pi na bateria, Chacal Freak no baixo, G.G Valentino Hunter e Fel de Pi nas guitarras a banda v\u00eam somando um p\u00fablico mais voltado a conte\u00fado do que formato. Da literatura a arte, da mis\u00e9ria a viol\u00eancia, com letras inspiradas na poesia intensa de Marcos Prado e Baudelaire somando ataques de f\u00faria de Shopenhauer, Dostoi\u00e9vski e Nietzsch a banda impressiona com a performance teatral e com forma l\u00edrica ao mesmo tempo insana de seus integrantes. Crias da d\u00e9cada de 90, estas crian\u00e7as pineicas foram cultivadas no underground curitibano ouvindo bandas como Beijo AA For\u00e7a, Zigurate, Ovos Presley, Pelebr\u00f3i N\u00e3o Sei, Os Catal\u00e9pticos, Imperial Malevolence. E em meio a um movimento pouco acomodado que defendia uma cultura independente anti-comercial o qual repudia todas as formas de controle, eles acreditam que a solu\u00e7\u00e3o para uma sociedade melhor est\u00e1 no livre ato de pensar. E enfrentando o autoritarismo e tudo que oprime a liberdade do pensamento, Pineia atrav\u00e9s de sua m\u00fasica niilista, vem travando uma constante luta contra a moralina e seu principal inimigo, ela mesma.", "title": "PINEIA 2012 - FECHO UMA IDEIA com Valentino Hunter e Phaela Piciformes", "publishedDate": "2012-12-09T15:26:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OW_As_ZdLs", "description": "No Comment.", "title": "Rowan Atkinson as Marc Almond", "publishedDate": "2008-07-12T15:07:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OWiFYR4odM", "description": "http://www.nstuffmusic.com/p-31770-taylor-custom-gs-adirondack-top-acoustic-electric-guitar.aspx\n\nGuitar \nStrings: 6 string\nShape: Grand Symphony\nCutaway: Venetian\n\nWood\nBack / Sides: Indian Rosewood, A\nBack Config.: 3-piece Mini Wedge\nTop: Andirondack Spruce\nFb / Bridge: Ebony / Ebony\nWedge: Same as Wood Binding\nNeck: Mahogany\nPh Veneer: Ebony\nBracing: Andirondack CV Bracing w/Relief Rout\n\nBinding \nMaterial: Ebony\nPeghead: Sam as Body, Fretboard\n\nPurfling \nMaterial: FIBER\nBody-Top: RED, B/W/B W/R/W\n\nRosette \nRosette: Abalone, Single Ring with Bound Soundhole\n\nInlays \nPh Logo: Taylor Mother of Pearl\nFretboard: No Fretboard Inlay\nPeghead: No Peghead Inlay\nBridge: No Bridge Inlay\nAbalone Trim: No Abalone Trim\n\nNeck \nWidth: 1-3/4\"\nScale Length: Standard 25-1/2\"\nNeck Profile: Standard Carve\nPeghead Type: Standard Peghead\n\nFinish \nBack/Sides: Gloss\nTop: Gloss\nNeck: Satin\nPeghead: Gloss\nStain/Sunburst: Tobacco Sunburst: top Only\n\nTuners: Gotoh 510 Antique Gold, 6 String\nNut/Saddles: Bone\nStrings: Elixir\u00ae NanoWeb\u00ae Medium Gauge Acoustic Strings\nBridge Pins: Ebony with Ab Dots\nPickguard: Tortoise Shell\nTRC: Ebony\nElectronics: Expression System\nCase: BROWN", "title": "Taylor Custom GS Adirondack Top Acoustic-Electric Guitar", "publishedDate": "2013-04-11T18:01:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OWjHnwCpxE", "description": "Inilah Lawakan Omesh Yang Dianggap Melecehkan Ulama di YKS", "title": "Inilah Lawakan Omesh Yang Dianggap Melecehkan Ulama di YKS", "publishedDate": "2014-02-05T17:38:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OWkG_4TqMg", "description": "Use Coulomb's law to determine how far a beam of electrons penetrates a region of electric field.", "title": "Coulomb's Law - Stopping a Beam of Electrons", "publishedDate": "2014-01-13T17:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OX2eVD59PE", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Med Student faints/fingernail removal", "publishedDate": "2011-04-11T03:55:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OXDSyiuuoQ", "description": "Piquete de Artiller\u00eda al final de la Magna procesi\u00f3n del Cristo del Prendimiento.

La fisura es usualmente de pocos metros de ancho y puede ser de varios kil\u00f3metros de largo. Pueden causar enormes flujos de basalto y canales de lava. Son dif\u00edciles de reconocer desde el suelo y desde el espacio, ya que no tiene una caldera central y la superficie es mayormente plana. El volc\u00e1n puede usualmente ser visto como una grieta en el suelo o en el lecho marino. Las fisuras estrechas pueden ser rellenadas con lava que las endurece. Como la erosi\u00f3n remueve sus alrededores, la masa de lava puede permanecer sobre la superficie como un dique. Los diques que sostienen a las fisuras pueden alcanzar la superficie desde profundidades de unos pocos kil\u00f3metros. Las fisuras son com\u00fanmente encontradas en o a lo largo de zonas rift, como Islandia y el Gran Valle del Rift de \u00c1frica.\n\nEn Islandia, las fisuras volc\u00e1nicas son a menudo largas fisuras paralelas a la zona rift donde las placas litosf\u00e9ricas est\u00e1n divergiendo. Algunas erupciones renovadas generalmente ocurren desde nuevas fracturas paralelas de entre cientos a miles de metros de las primeras fisuras. Esta distribuci\u00f3n construye generalmente una delgada meseta de lava m\u00e1s que un \u00fanico edificio volc\u00e1nico. El sistema de fisuras de Laki produjo la erupci\u00f3n m\u00e1s grande registrada en la historia, en forma de flujo bas\u00e1ltico, durante la erupci\u00f3n del Eldgj\u00e1 en 934 a. C., la cual solt\u00f3 19,6 km\u00b3 de lava.\n\nLas fisuras volc\u00e1nicas radiales de los volcanes de Haw\u00e1i producen \u201ccortinas de fuego\u201d como fuentes de lava que erupcionan a lo largo de una porci\u00f3n de una fisura. \u00c9stas provocan unas rampas bajas de salpicaduras bas\u00e1lticas en ambos lados de la fisura. Algunas fuentes de lava m\u00e1s aisladas a lo largo de la fisura producen peque\u00f1os cr\u00e1teres y conos de escoria. Los fragmentos que forman un cono de salpicadura son lo suficientemente calientes y pl\u00e1sticos para soldarse entre ellos, mientras que los fragmentos que forman un cono de escoria se mantienen separados a causa de su temperatura m\u00e1s baja.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure or eruption fissure, is a linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is often a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in lava channels and later in lava tubes. After some time the eruption builds up spatter resp. ash cones and may concentrate on one or some of them. Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible from the air, but the crater rows (see Laki) or the canyons (see Eldgj\u00e1) built up by some of them are.\n\nThe dykes that feed fissures reach the surface from depths of a few kilometers and connect them to deeper magma reservoirs, often under volcanic centers. Fissures are usually found in or along rifts and rift zones, such as Iceland and the East African Rift. Fissure vents are often part of the structure of shield volcanoes.\n\n\n\n\nUma erup\u00e7\u00e3o fissural ou fissura vulc\u00e2nica \u00e9 uma erup\u00e7\u00e3o vulc\u00e2nica que ocorre ao longo de uma fissura mais ou menos linear na crusta, em geral com poucos metros de largura, mas com centenas ou mesmo milhares de metros de comprimento. A lava \u00e9 expelida pela fissura, geralmente sem actividade explosiva, escorrendo sobre a superf\u00edcie em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da topografia pr\u00e9-existente.\n\n\n\n\nEin Spaltenvulkan (englisch: fissure vent) ist eine spezielle Art von Vulkan.\n\nAuch ein Zentralvulkan besitzt oft ein Spaltensystem, wie z.B. bei Krafla in Island nachweisbar.\n\nEin Spaltenvulkan hat hingegen (ggf. noch) keinen zentralen r\u00f6hrenf\u00f6rmigen F\u00f6rderschlot. Stattdessen flie\u00dft die Lava aus einer l\u00e4nglichen Spalte, wodurch oft ein Bergr\u00fccken mit weitfl\u00e4chigen Lavafeldern entsteht. Es kann sich aber ebenso gut um entstehende Kraterreihen handeln.\n\nSpaltenvulkane k\u00f6nnen etwa mit Schildvulkanen verbundene Spalten darstellen, wie etwa auf Reykjanesskagi oder auch eigenst\u00e4ndig sein, wie beim Alu in \u00c4thiopien oder Mount Tarawera in Neuseeland.\n\n\n\n\nUne fissure volcanique est une fissure \u00e0 travers laquelle de la lave jaillit, habituellement sans activit\u00e9 explosive. La fissure est la plupart du temps large de quelques m\u00e8tres, mais elle peut \u00eatre longue de plusieurs kilom\u00e8tres. Ce type de volcan est difficile \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre depuis le sol ou l'espace, puisqu'il ne poss\u00e8de pas de caldeira centrale, et que sa surface est plate. Il faut pour cela proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des analyses g\u00e9ologiques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb ( Texto ) :\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure_vent\n\n\n\nWeb ( Imagenes ) : \n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kamoamoa_Fissure_Eruption \n\n\n\nWeb ( Musica ) : \n\nhttp://audionautix.com/", "title": "Kamoamoa Fissure Volcano Eruption ( Kilauea - Hawaii ) - Volcan Kamoamoa Lava Volcanica En Hawai HD", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T19:46:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OaAnjYa5Yo", "description": "IV- Yttrium Fiat Lux Academe", "title": "IV- Yttrium Fiat Lux Academe", "publishedDate": "2009-03-08T05:56:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OaM6m7SKOM", "description": "Hermann Maier falls spectacularly during Men's Downhill at Nagano in 1998\nFinnish commentary by Mikko Hannula", "title": "Hermann Maier - Nagano 1998", "publishedDate": "2010-09-29T14:11:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Oax1qAZBnI", "description": "Please LIKE\n\nand Subscribe for more", "title": "Lithuanian Football - A league Best goals 2014 HD", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T13:55:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Ob_XsIK2PE", "description": "www.nerveblocks.co.uk", "title": "Locating median ulnar and musculocutaneous nerve for axillary block", "publishedDate": "2011-09-04T19:56:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Obgu3_Pjg0", "description": "www.youtube.com", "title": "Shinny hockey Stanley cup finals game 7", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T19:12:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ObvbPKUecs", "description": "The Iowa Gardener, Veronica Fowler, shows how to deadhead coreopsis and like flowers.", "title": "Deadheading Coreopsis", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T21:41:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ObxcMxbsGM", "description": "", "title": "Lot 33 - M12 - PERCEVAL DES ARACHIS par RAGTIME PONTADOUR et ROSELIA", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T17:29:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Oc4_STdHEc", "description": "HEEEEEEEEEY!!!

Maria explains that keeping your arm straight is important to a point, but what is critical is that you come back to the ball with a straight left arm that mirrors your left arm when you addressed the ball.  \n\nMaria suggests you think of your left arm as an extension of the golf club.  To maximize power into the ball you want your left arm to be fully extended, you don't want to come back down into the ball with a broken club shaft. Whether or not you keep your left arm straight on the back swing has a lot to do with your flexibility.  An inflexible person who is tight in the shoulders, chest and upper back will have a hard time keeping their arms fully extended on the back swing. \n\nIt is okay to have a little bend at the top in your left arm as long as it returns straight at the bottom. Many great players have had a little bend, Jack Nicklaus being one of them.

It is characterized by episodes of vertigo, low-pitched tinnitus, and hearing loss. The hearing loss is for some time fluctuating rather than permanent, meaning that it comes and goes, alternating between ears, then becomes permanent with no return to normal function. It is named after the French physician Prosper M\u00e9ni\u00e8re, who, in an article published in 1861, first reported that vertigo was caused by inner ear disorders. The condition affects people differently; it can range in intensity from being a mild annoyance to a lifelong condition.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's_disease\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nVestibular_system's_semicircular_canal-_a_cross-section.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re's_disease\n\nMenieres-hearing-loss.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re's_disease", "title": "All About - M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T23:10:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Op1uvMFebo", "description": "http://mruniversity.com/courses/economic-history-soviet-union/why-study-marx\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FK6Y/", "title": "Why Study Marx?", "publishedDate": "2014-05-05T13:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OpH5rr5beE", "description": "Download Matthew's App https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ultimate-golf-coach/id466706894?mt=8\n\nReview of the Mizuno JPX EZ Fairway by Award winning PGA Professional Matthew Conner, \n\nUK Golf Tuition Breaks.

It borders Saudi Arabia to the east and south-east, Iraq to the east, Syria to the north and West Bank and Israel to the west, sharing control of the Dead Sea. Jordan's only port is at its southern tip, at the Gulf of Aqaba, which is shared with Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Much of Jordan is covered by the Arabian Desert. However, the north-western part of Jordan is part of the Fertile Crescent. The capital city is Amman.\n\nDuring its history, Jordan has seen numerous civilizations, including those of the Ancient Near East with the Canaanite and later other Semitic peoples such as the Edomites, and the Moabites. Other civilizations possessing political sovereignty and influence in Jordan were: Akkadian, Assyrian, Israelite/Judean, Babylonian, and Persian empires. The lands of Jordan were for a time under the rule of Pharaonic Egypt, composed part of the greater Kingdom of Israel (including the later Judaean Kingdom, Hasmonaen Kingdom of Israel and Herodian Dynasty), and notably, the region of Jordan also gave birth to the Nabataean civilization which left rich archaeological remains at Petra, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World located in the Ma'an Governorate. Cultures further west also left their mark, such as the Macedonian/Greek/Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman empires. Since the seventh century, the area has been under the primary rule of Muslim and Arab cultures, with the exceptions briefly for the area in Western Jordan during the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and for the entire region during the early-mid twentieth century under British rule which led to Jordan's establishment as an autonomous state.\n\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with representative government. The reigning monarch is the chief executive and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The king exercises his executive authority through the prime ministers and the Council of Ministers, or cabinet. The cabinet, meanwhile, is responsible before the democratically elected House of Deputies which, along with the House of Notables (Senate), constitutes the legislative branch of the government. The judicial branch is an independent branch of the government.\n\nModern Jordan is predominantly urbanized. Jordan is classified as a country of \"high human development\" by the 2010 Human Development Report.[8] Furthermore, The Kingdom has been classified as an emerging market with a free market economy by the CIA World Fact Book. It has more Free Trade Agreements than any other country in the region. It has a \"pro-Western\" regime with very close relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. It also became a major non-NATO ally of the United States in 1996, and is one of only two nations in the region, the other being Egypt, that have diplomatic relations with Israel.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] It is a founding member of the Arab League,[17] the WTO,[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] the AFESD,[26] the Arab Parliament,[27] the AIDMO, the AMF,[28] the IMF,[29][30] the International Criminal Court,[31] the UNHRC,[32] the GAFTA, the ESCWA,[33] the ENP[34][35][36] and the United Nations.[37] Jordan is also currently undergoing close integration with the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Jordan enjoys \"advanced status\" with the European Union.

We called a few months back and they said we would see it on the next bill.  We did not.  We called again and kept getting the same response.  Today, my wife called and asked to speak to a supervisor.  After 30 min of waiting on hold, I decided to call from my phone.  We kept hers on too, just to see how long it would go.  I was able to speak to a supervisor, William, that aplogized for the inconvenience but said that the computer did not show my credit.  OBVIOUSLY!!!  I asked how to get it, and he said I can't.  When I brought up the fact that my grandparents are getting theirs, so I should get mine, he read off his script and aplogized again.  I asked to speak to his manager and he said protocol would not allow it, and he was as far as I would get.  He told me to write a letter.

Although there are several factors that affect stature beyond our control, there are some things we can do to grow as much as possible, under the circumstances. Once you get past the growing age, your height can not be changed, but before the years end you're growing, you can try the exercises that here we show to grow taller.\nUnderstand that height is primarily determined by genetics . The height is a polygenic trait, ie is defined by multiple genes. Short people have parents does not mean you're going to be tiny, nor your parents are high mean you will be a giant. Anyway, do not fret, because you can not know how high you're going to be until you reach the full physical, and after age 20.\n\nCalculate your approximate height. Be in centimeters or inches, you can try to guess what will your height Based on your parents.\nAdd the height of your parents.\nAdd 13cm (5 inches) if you're a guy, and if you're a girl r\u00e9staselos.\nDivide it by 2.\nThe result is your estimated height, 10 cm up or down. Note that this is not an exact estimate, but should be fairly close.\nAvoid that hinders growth . Maybe you can not do much to increase your height genetics, but if you can take some steps to make your natural height is not reduced by external influences. Drugs and alcohol are two factors that limit growth if you consume during your youth, and malnutrition could prevent you reached your full height.\n'' Does caffeine prevents growth?'' Scientific studies indicate that, caffeine does not hinder growth. Even with all the caffeine might prevent you to sleep deeply or within your scheduled rest. Children and teenagers need about 9 or 10 hours of sleep a day, and caffeine could take away much-needed sleep.\nIf I smoke, will grow less? effects from smoking, or passive smoking, in body mass index are confusing. Columbia University, on its Web health resources on the Internet, says that \"although the studies that have been conducted are contradictory, research shows that children who smoke, or have been exposed to smoke snuff, are lower than those who do not smoke, or who have non-smoking parents.\nSteroids'' Do they affect growth?'' Definitely yes. Anabolic Steroids and prevent the growth of bones in children and adolescents, and also produce reduction in breast size, low sperm count and high blood pressure, which carries the risk of having a heart attack. Children and adolescents with asthma, and use that dose steroid inhalers such as salbutamol, are, on average, about 2 cm lower than those who did not receive steroids\nhttp://youtu.be/5OqlVZ2z7h0", "title": "HOW TO GROW TALLER", "publishedDate": "2010-07-17T10:13:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OqmzpZ4A5c", "description": "From the album, \u201cClasificacion C, Vol. 1\u201d.

From a young age Michael showed a natural talent on the piano and he was enrolled at the tender age of nine to the Hennessy School of Music, Carlow. His time at the school broadened his confidence and he successfully entertained local audiences with his music. However Michael knew his talent could captivate a wider audience and at eleven years of age he wrote to Gay Byrne asking if he could appear on the Late Late Show. Performing a song he had written himself, the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9's performance received a rapturous response. He recalls that on the day he was 'a huge bag of nerves', but after the performance he intuitively knew that this was what he wanted to do with his life.\n\nNow in the summer of 2008 and under the tutorship of Louis Walsh, Michael is about to release an album of well-known songs titled; 'All My Life'. It is a beautiful collection of 16 classic songs by artists such as Foster & Allen, Eddy Arnold, Colin Raye and many more. Produced by the legendary Nigel Wright (Barbra Streisand, Jose Carreras, Sarah Brightman), the album includes duets with renowned Irish singers Daniel O'Donnell and Linda Martin, showcasing Michael's superb and versatile voice.", "title": "Michael English - All My Life - TV Ad", "publishedDate": "2009-05-25T15:02:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Ov9Lhg5F_I", "description": "Enjoy my last full production for awhile.

Starring Byron Pang and Thomas Price. It revolves around the story of a Chinese fitness trainer, Kafka, who meets Daniel, a business executive. The film is directed by acclaimed Hong Kong Chinese film-maker Scud, the stage name of Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung. It was nominated for a Teddy Award at the Berlin International Film Festival of 2010.\n\nKafka is straight while Daniel happens to be gay. The young men fall in love, believing that their love can bridge anything, despite their difference in sexuality and Kafka's drug-taking. Daniel does not regret his love for Kafka, who tries to love him back against his nature. But a flashback memory from Kafka's past makes it difficult for their relationship to work. It turns out that their addiction to love proves more fatal than the drugs they use to explore the boundaries of their friendship.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine_(2009_film)", "title": "Interlude Music - \"Amphetamine\" movies 2010 - Daniel x Kafka", "publishedDate": "2010-09-29T01:59:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "5OyoKI9ViCk", "description": "Comment utiliser les stiping tape (scotch nail art) / How to use striping tape in nail art.\n\n\u2665 Si vous avez aim\u00e9 ma video, n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 cliquer sur le pouce vert !

It was first composed in Latin ca.1418-1427. It is a handbook for spiritual life arising from the Devotio Moderna movement, of which Kempis was a member.\n\nThe Imitation is perhaps the most widely read devotional work next to the Bible, and is regarded as a devotional and religious classic. Apart from the Bible, no book has been translated into more languages than the Imitation of Christ.\n\nThe text is divided into four books, which provide detailed spiritual instructions: \"Helpful Counsels of the Spiritual Life\", \"Directives for the Interior Life\", \"On Interior Consolation\" and \"On the Blessed Sacrament\".\n\nThe approach taken in the Imitation is characterized by its emphasis on the interior life and withdrawal from the world, as opposed to an active imitation of Christ by other friars.

Mistilteinn me\u00f0 gul bl\u00f3m. Eitru\u00f0 planta. Poisonous Plants.\n\nMistilteinn (\"Mistletoe\"), also known as Misteltein or Mystletainn, is Hr\u00f3mundr Gripsson's sword in Hr\u00f3mundar saga Gripssonar, a legendary saga from Iceland. Mistilteinn first belonged to \u00der\u00e1inn, who had been king in Valland before he retired in his burial mound with his wealth. The Danish king \u00d3l\u00e1fr and his men, among whom Hr\u00f3mundr Gripsson, learnt about that and found the barrow. \u00der\u00e1inn, who had become a draugr (living dead) was sitting inside. No one but Hr\u00f3mundr dared to enter. After a long and fierce fight, he defeated \u00der\u00e1inn and took his treasure, especially his sword, with which \u00der\u00e1inn had killed four hundred and twenty men, including the Swedish king Semingr. Hr\u00f3mundr used Mistilteinn during the battle between \u00d3l\u00e1fr and two Swedish kings both named Haldingr. He killed Helgi inn fr\u00e6kni (the Valiant), who had slain his brothers. He then lost Mistilteinn in the water out of witchcraft. He deeply felt this loss but soon recovered his sword, which was found in the stomach of a pike. But Mistilteinn was of no help when he fought king Haldingr, whom he eventually killed with a club. In Gesta Danorum, Mistletoe is the weapon used to kill Baldr. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistilteinn\n\nThe name mistletoe was originally applied to Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales), the only species native in Great Britain and much of Europe. European mistletoe is readily recognized by its smooth-edged oval evergreen leaves borne in pairs along the woody stem, and waxy white berries in dense clusters of two to six. It is a poisonous plant that causes acute gastrointestinal problems including stomach pain and diarrhea along with low pulse. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistletoe\n\nMidhurst is the home of English  polo and matches are played from  May to September.

It is also known as Sanatan Dharma, which means the eternal right path. In fact it is the only religion in the world, which does not encourage conversion.\n\nIt is more than a religion; it is a way of life. It is not a man made religion, founded or created by any prophet. It has no origin and no end. It is a religion of freedom and, unlike most other religions; it allows absolute freedom of one's faith and mode of worship. Indeed, it is the only religion in the world, which respects the right of people to realize the Almighty by their own free will.\n\nThe history of Hinduism has proved that it is a living force. Both hostile rulers and foreign aggressors could not banish it because it is a religion of self-experience and self-realization. It is not based on any dogmas or set of rules to be accepted with blind faith which is why atheism is accepted in it. Yet, Hinduism has a very close understanding of and relationship with the Almighty God.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExcellent Links to Understand INDIA and its Survival:\n\n1.

The disability from migraine headaches is an enormous health burden affecting over 30 million Americans.  In a five year study, presented at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Plastic Surgery 2009 conference, Oct. 23-27, in Seattle, doctors first injected 100 migraine sufferers with botulinum toxin A to help identify the muscle groups that were triggering the headaches. Patients who reported improvement in their migraines lasting at least four weeks after the injection (89 patients), had surgery to deactivate the muscle groups or \"trigger sites.\"  Since the surgery, 79 of the patients have been followed for five years.  Of those, the outcome has been promising.  Ninety percent (71 patients) have maintained the initial positive response to the surgery. Twenty-eight percent (22 patients) had elimination of migraines entirely, 62 percent (49 patients) noticed a significant decrease, and only 10 percent (8 patients) experienced no change.  This 5-year data provides strong evidence that surgical manipulation of one or more migraine trigger sites can successfully eliminate (cure) or reduce the frequency, duration, and/or intensity of migraine headaches.", "title": "Pulling the Trigger on Migraines: Have We Found a Cure?", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T22:05:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5P_B11eFcj8", "description": "Gnarls Barkely cover Radiohead at Benicassim", "title": "Gnarls Barkley Reckoner", "publishedDate": "2008-07-21T16:31:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5P_DzvFZsac", "description": "Palpating the brachial plexus.\n\nCheck out my blog to learn more at http://zaccupples.wordpress.com", "title": "Brachial Plexus Palpation", "publishedDate": "2013-04-15T13:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5P_Q41A6qec", "description": "http://www.mediafire.com/?0j35dw62wlsj6tm", "title": "NABU - VAYA DRAMA", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T04:39:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "5Pa2YqhBGok", "description": "We BEATBOXed at Shinjuku \u2606\u2606\n\nAIBO&TATSUYA&Ettoman\nwe are japanese beatboxer^^)vv\n\nEttoman \uff1a http://www.youtube.com/user/EttomanSounds\nTATSUYA \uff1a http://www.youtube.com/user/tatsuya1109humanism", "title": "BEATBOX at the crossroad!!", "publishedDate": "2012-02-08T10:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PaXP4BrDpE", "description": "Crocs Crocband Jaunt csizma\nwww.tranzitshop.hu", "title": "Crocs Crocband Jaunt csizma", "publishedDate": "2012-10-27T20:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PaiDuiLzas", "description": "You can see I turned the Bassman to 5 on this one.

Do you regret that now? \n\nMcCain: No, I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy. \n\nMcCain has been an advocate of deregulation most of his career, but Thursday he endorsed the biggest bailout in history - a plan for the government to take on the bad debts of financial institutions. \n\n\"We're gonna take over these bad loans. We're gonna take over these bad - these bonds and we're gonna keep you alive. And we're gonna have the taxpayer help you out. But when the time comes and the economy recovers then anything that's gained back is gonna go to the taxpayers first. I'm not saying this isn't gonna be messy. And I'm not saying it isn't gonna be expensive. But we have to stop the bleeding,\" the senator said. \n\nPelley: But why would you let the Wall Street executives \n\nMcCain: I'm not. \n\nPelley: sail away on their yachts and leave this on the American taxpayer? \n\nMcCain: Well, it's not the greedy Wall Street people that I worry about, although I am, like most Americans, frankly, enraged.

For the top 25 things to do in Delhi, click on this link - http://migrationology.com/2013/04/25-things-to-do-in-delhi-india/\n\nDelhi, India, specifically Old Delhi, is a haven for food lovers. Some of the cities most renowned and popular legendary street food stalls are within the winding lanes of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi. This area of town is a throwback in time - things are ancient and classic. No food tour of Delhi would be complete without navigating the crowded waters of Paranthe Wali Gali, translated meaning the lane or street of fried bread. Let me tell you, this is literally what you'll find, and you're going to love it when you're in Delhi!\n\nSo one day I headed to Paranthe Wali Gali, not the easiest place in Delhi to find, but just walk through the back alleys of Chandni Chowk, ask locals, and eventually you'll find it - in all its glory. The day I went the alley was packed out with pedestrians. It was so full it was almost hard to walk through the density, but single file we walked until we could smell the parathas being fried - the aroma of Paranthe Wali Gali. On this back street there are a number of restaurants all serving parathas, but I chose a restaurant called Babu Ram Paranthe Wale. Some claim this one is the best, while others favor other spots. I think they are all pretty much the same, with similar flavors and similar prices. Just choose one, I don't think you'll go wrong with any choice when you're on Paranthe Wali Gali!\n\nPart of the joy of eating on Paranthe Wali Gali is the crowded ambiance, everyone searching for the delicious flavors of a paratha fried bread. So what is a paratha? Well it all begins with a ball of roti like dough that's first kneaded out into a roti shape and then stuffed with a choice of fillings and then rolled out some more. The paratha is then transferred into extremely hot oil where it bubbles up in seconds and scorched the paratha through and through so it's crispy on the outside and baked through the middle. At Babu Ram Paranthe Wale, the parathas are then dished onto metal plates and served with a couple chutneys that include a pumpkin curry, a peas curry, and a red sauce that sort of tasted like the American version of sweet and sour ketchup. All these side dishes are used to take a piece of paratha and then dip it into for extra delicious flavoring.\n\nThe menu is an indicator of just how good and how popular Paranthe Wali Gali is. It's covered in grease and barely readable. I ordered a couple of mixed parathas and a peas only paratha. They were delivered to our table piping hot with some oil still oozing out. To eat them you just break off a piece and dip it into your sauce of choice and enjoy. Each paratha cost around 40 Rupees. Although they were extremely delicious, if you can't handle the grease, it's not for you - these are greasy! I had 3 and I wasn't full, but I was feeling a little greased out. That being said, they were super tasty and any visit to Delhi should include a visit to Paranthe Gali Wali. Many customers also choose to guzzle down a few creamy lassis served in earthenware cups to go along with their stack of parathas.\nPrices: Each one is 30 - 40 INR ($0.55 - $0.73) and you can probably eat 3 - 5, that is if you can handle the grease!\nOpen Hours: 9 am - 11 pm daily\nAddress: 1984 Gali Paranthe Wali, Chandni Chowk, Delhi\n\nFollow my food adventures at http://migrationology.com/ & http://www.eatingthaifood.com/ Delhi Travel Guide: http://migrationology.com/delhi-travel-guide-ebook/\nBangkok Travel Guide: http://migrationology.com/ebook-101-things-to-do-in-bangkok/\nThai Food Guide: http://www.eatingthaifood.com/eating-thai-food-guide/\nFinally, subscribe so you don't miss the next tasty adventure http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=migrationology", "title": "Paranthe Wali Gali - Delhi's World Famous Fried Bread Street", "publishedDate": "2013-07-21T13:00:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PjuN6ZY5lM", "description": "Timbale van Belle Perez uit het Latino Mundial concert in Utrecht", "title": "Belle Perez - Timbale (Live @ Latino Mundial Utrecht)", "publishedDate": "2010-04-30T14:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PlQaLKOnDQ", "description": "Perfect Voice, Warmest Love Macao Concert was held on 11, Oct, 2014, featuring Hong Kong and Taiwanese stars Miriam Yeung, Joey Yung, Julian Cheung, William So, Ivana Wong, Vincy Chan, C AllStar and Phil Chang.

Daniel Radcliffe spielt in DIE FRAU IN SCHWARZ an der Seite von Ciar\u00e1n Hinds (\u201eDame, K\u00f6nig, As, Spion\", \u201eThere Will Be Blood\"), Liz White (\u201eVera Drake\") und Janet McTeer (\u201eAlbert Nobbs\", \u201eWaking the Dead\") die erste Kinorolle nach seinem \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigenden Erfolg als \u201eHarry Potter\", die ihn weltber\u00fchmt gemacht hat. Das Drehbuch verfasst Jane Goldman, die bereits das Drehbuch zu \u201eX Men: Erste Entscheidung\" und dem Spionagethriller \u201eEine offene Rechung\" schrieb.", "title": "Die Frau in Schwarz - Daniel Radcliffe \u00fcber Arthur Kipps", "publishedDate": "2012-03-22T15:58:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PqtLphNDcI", "description": "By : Leonardo Souza '", "title": "Aquecimento - Tingele Pock ( Dj's 22 Mais Patto & Caveirinha ).", "publishedDate": "2011-10-21T20:34:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PrCII5OIxs", "description": "my facebook https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008223018124\nmy network: https://www.youtube.com/user/mcnfreedom", "title": "SHOENICE SLAMS ABSINTHE", "publishedDate": "2012-08-17T17:14:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "5PrqCYkSQy0", "description": "If you have been to one of our Galmatic Workshops then you know where the dipstick is and how and when to check the oil. \n\nBut do you know how to pour the oil into the engine without spilling any oil? \nIt's a trick that works with all bottles, no matter what you are pouring -- so not just car engine oil!\n\nWatch our quick video to learn this trick and two other tips you need to remember when you are playing with your dipstick.\n\nBut when you're pouring the oil it's easy to get it everywhere!

Pop on over to our 'How to check your oil video'.\n\nKeep a litre of oil in the boot of the car as most of the time you will probably be checking your oil at the service station or on a long trip, so its handy to have some available. \n\nMake sure to keep an oil rag in there too, just in case you do spill a little, and for any quick debris cleaning you might need to do. Watch our 'How to keep spiders out of the car' video here to see why you need an oil rag in the car!\n\nAnd lastly, keep some baby wipes in the boot to clean any grease off your hands. \n\nThanks for watching our video, if it revved your engine, make sure to like it, and share it with all of the gals in your life. \n\nAnd whilst you have your toolbox open, why not subscribe to our channel so that you don't miss out on any car care tips.\n\nThe Galmatic garage is the go to for the how to on anything auto for us gals, so cruise on over to Galmatic.com and subscribe to our Garage News. \n\nSee you in a workshop!\n\nhttp://www.galmatic.com", "title": "You Found The Dipstick - now learn how not to spill a drop!
