Can you truly build a long term residual income with this company? This review will dive deep into why so many reps are failing. \n\n0:01 Nerium international review starts\n0:25 the major reason people struggle with nerium international\n0:55 the simple solution to the biggest problem nerium international reps face\n1:20 how to have endless new interested prospects daily for your nerium international biz\n1:51 free nerium international lead generation training\n\nIs Nerium International the business that bring you financial freedom? or is it a scam that is here today and will be gone tomorrow? These\nare some great questions and I'm glad you're doing your research before you decide to go all in and join Nerium. \n\nA little information about Nerium International. \n\nLet me put your mind at ease. Nerium International is not a scam. It is a network marketing business in the skincare field. A field that \ndoes over $175 billion dollars annually. It is built on a solid business foundation and will be around for years to come. There\nis a definite need in the marketplace since people care about their appearance and are constantly looking for new ways, or products\nto help them maintain their youthful look. \n\nThere is one major drawback though. There is one major problem that causes 97% of Nerium International reps to struggle. That problem is lack \nof prospects. \n\nWhen you join Nerium you are taught to go out and make a list of family members and friends and market your business to them. The \nproblem with that is that people run out of prospects and then don't know who to market their business to on a daily basis. \n\nWithout leads you have no business. It doesn't matter how great the compensation plan is. \n\nNerium, like any other network marketing company, only pays you when you do 1 of 2 things. \n\n1. You sell the company products\n2. You bring in new distributors. \n\nIn order to maximize the Nerium International compensation plan you have to be able to recruit large amounts of people. In order to recruit \nyou need leads. Without leads you have no business. The simple truth is there are thousands, even hundreds of thousands of people\nsearching for Nerium International and/or it's products or products like it on a daily/monthly basis.\n\nThe truth is thanks to the internet it is simple to tap into this endless wave of potential customers using websites you are probably \nalready a part of. Sites like youtube, google, facebook etc. \n\nOnce you know how to tap into these prospects you don't have to worry about selling, or convincing people why they should join you. You \nwill be dealing with people that are already interested in what you have to offer. People that have already done research or found a need\nNerium just looking for the right distributor to get involved with. \n\nThe good thing is everything you need to set yourself up in front of all of these potential prospects is very simple to set up and is \nliterally at your fingertips. Instead of hassling your friends and family trying to convince them why they should join you, you will be \nattracting only the most interested prospects to your Nerium International business on a daily basis. \n\nThe reason this business was created was because there was a need and a want in the market place. That means that there are people actively\nsearching for the products and services on a daily basis. So why chase people when all you have to do is position your opportunity\nin front of the people that are looking for it? How easy do you think it is to sell something to someone that came to you looking to buy \nsomething. \n\nhttp://workwithdayton.com/youtube?t=nerium\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrsITsoNL9VBL4KkcLF-eNw", "title": "Nerium International Exposed - Why 97% of Nerium International Reps Are Failing", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T21:09:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bb_y3XZtNYU", "description": "Getting back into a trade after it's been stopped out by your system... a good idea?  \n\nIn this week's 4-Minute Drill Norman explains what you should and should not do when looking to re-enter a trade.

Particle Fever follows six brilliant scientists during the launch of the Large Hadron Collider, marking the start-up of the biggest and most expensive experiment in the history of the planet, pushing the edge of human innovation.\n\nAs they seek to unravel the mysteries of the universe, 10,000 scientists from over 100 countries joined forces in pursuit of a single goal: to recreate conditions that existed just moments after the Big Bang and find the Higgs boson, potentially explaining the origin of all matter. But our heroes confront an even bigger challenge: have we reached our limit in understanding why we exist?\n\nDirected by Mark Levinson, a physicist turned filmmaker, from the inspiration and initiative of producer David Kaplan and masterfully edited by Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The English Patient), Particle Fever is a celebration of discovery, revealing the very human stories behind this epic machine.\n\nWebsite: http://particlefever.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ParticleFever\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ParticleFever\n\n\"particle fever\" \"particle fever trailer\" \"particle fever documentary\" particle physics science scientist physicist \"mark levinson\" \"large hadron collider\" experiment \"science experiment\" innovation universe \"big bang\" \"higgs boson\" origin matter documentary \"walter murch\" discover machine \"god particle\" vchan", "title": "Particle Fever Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Documentary HD", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T21:04:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbbbrkjpRBk", "description": "SUBSCRIBE TO MY FRIENDS CHANNEL:http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqO3...\n\n\nALSO WATCH MY OTHER FRIENDS VIDEOS AND SUBSCRIBE TO HIM ALSO.HE POSTS GTA 5 STUNTS MONTAGES,TIPS AND TRICKS AND FUNNY MOMMENTS.\n\nHIS CHANNELS LINK:http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOH0B...\n\nMY INSTAGRAM: FistsToFace\nFACEBOOK CHANNEL PAGE: kasra oa\nTWITTER: kiyan tagh\n\nPLZZ LEAVE A COMMENT IF U WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING OR WANT TO TALK TO ME\n\nTNX.

A total of about 230, 000 people have been evacuated from the region so far.  According to state media, Xinhua News Agency, a 6.2 earthquake hit the impoverished Ludian region in the afternoon, a region that is just about 70 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of Yunnan province\u2019s capital, Kunming.  The news agency reported that many of the homes that collapsed in Ludian had a population of about 429,000 and added that they were mostly old and made of bricks, mud and wood. \n\nAs a result of the disaster, residents in the country have been cut off from electricity and telecommunications. The region known for farming and mining is highly prone to earthquakes.  This earthquake, however, is the largest in the Yunnan region in over a decade.  According to the Yunnan Civil Affairs Bureau, 398 people have been killed and more than 1800 have been injured.  It stated that three persons have also been reported missing so far.  The death toll is expected to rise, however, as rescue teams reach more and more communities that have been cut off. Since the 30 seconds long earthquake, residence have experienced up to four hundred after-shocks. Added to this, there has been heavy rains and massive landslides which have hindered rescue teams from accessing some of the most remote of the affected area.  \n\nThe state news source, Xinhua, reported that the government has since despatched more than 2,500 troops to the disaster region. Officials in Southern China says they are continuing their assessment of the damage to the region. They have since sent relief aids in the form of tents folding beds, chairs, tables and mobile toilets to disaster region. Upon his visit to the disaster site, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged local officials to focus their attention on search and rescue and also on providing adequate supplies and medical attention for residents affected by the disaster. \n\nThe White House sent its condolences on Sunday, and expressed intentions to offer relief assistance.  National Security Council Deputy Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said, \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the families of those that lost their lives, those injured or displaced, and all the people of China on this difficult day. U.S. disaster response officials are in contact with their Chinese counterparts. The United States stands ready to assist.\u201d The international community also shares their condolence and support to the affected Chinese. \n\nThe spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General offered condolences to the Chinese Government and the families of those killed.  He added that the UN is ready to \u201crespond to humanitarian needs\u201d and to \u201cmobilize international support\u201d as needed.", "title": "Earthquake Hits China | NATW International News", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T16:15:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbiSdiRu6Wc", "description": "THE GIRLS IN SONIC X ROCK AND I CAN PROVE IT WITH THIS VIDEO!!!", "title": "Sonic X Girls: Never Underestimate a Girl", "publishedDate": "2007-01-06T14:47:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbizTBYs-rQ", "description": "This is a continuation of the Intro scene I made six months ago.

The two pawns in the center are what is known as a duo, it's a very valuable thing to have, it acts as a shield and you can develop your pieces around and behind it. You can develop one knight here to f3, the other knight goes to c3, this is four golden moves. White brings up a bishop, five golden moves, brings up the other bishop, six golden moves. The king castles gets to safety, seven golden moves, brings up the queen to get out-of-the-way of the rooks, eight golden moves. Nine and ten, the rooks come to the middle of the board and these are the ten golden moves.\n\nIt's also known as the bull's head, the two center pawns are supposed to represent the forehead of the bull, the bishops are like it's horns and the rest of the pieces behind the two center pawns are like the body of the bull.

It was Romanized and remained a great capital until the earthquake of 365. A thousand years of history is written into its ruins, which have been famous since the 18th century.\n\nGrinus (they say), the son of Aesanius, a descendant of Theras, and king of the island of Thera, went to Delphi to offer a hecatomb on behalf of his native city. On Grinus consulting the oracle about sundry matters, the Pythoness gave him for answer, \"that he should found a city in Libya.\" When the embassy returned to Thera, small account was taken of the oracle, as the Therans were quite ignorant where Libya was.\n\nSeven years passed from the utterance of the oracle, and not a drop of rain fell in Thera: all the trees in the island, except one, were killed with the drought. After a while, everything began to go wrong. Ignorant of the cause of their sufferings, they again sent to Delphi to inquire for what reason they were afflicted. The Pythoness in reply reminded them reproachfully \"that if they and Battus would make a settlement at Cyrene in Libya, things would go better with them.\" So, as there was no help for it, they sent messengers to Crete, to inquire whether any of the Cretans, or of the strangers living amongst them, had ever travelled as far as Libya: and these messengers fell in with a man named Corobius, a dealer in purple dye. In answer to their inquiries, he told them that contrary winds had once carried him to Libya, where he had gone ashore on a certain island which was named Platea. So they hired this man's services, and took him back with them to Thera. A few persons then sailed from Thera to reconnoiter. Guided by Corobius to the island of Platea, they left him there with provisions for a certain number of months, and returned home with all speed to give their countrymen an account of the island.\n\nThe Therans who had left Corobius at Platea, when they reached Thera, told their countrymen that they had colonized an island on the coast of Libya. They of Thera, upon this, resolved that men should be sent to join the colony from each of their seven districts, and that the brothers in every family should draw lots to determine who were to go. Upon this the Therans sent out Battus with two penteconters, and with these he proceeded to Libya; but within a little time, not knowing what else to do, the men returned and arrived back off Thera. The Therans, when they saw the vessels approaching, received them with showers of missiles, would not allow them to come near the shore, and ordered the men to sail back from whence they came. Thus compelled, they settled on Platea.\n\nIn this place they continued two years, but at the end of that time, as their ill luck still followed them, they went in a body to Delphi, where they made complaint at the shrine to the effect that they prospered as poorly as before. Hereon the Pythoness made them the following answer: \"Know you better than I, fair Libya abounding in fleeces? Better the stranger than he who has trod it ? Oh ! Clever Therans !\" Battus and his friends, when they heard this, sailed back to Platea: it was plain the god would not hold them acquitted of the colony ,till they were absolutely in Libya. So they made a settlement on the mainland directly opposite Platea, fixing themselves at a place called Aziris.\n\nHere they remained six years, at the end of which time the Libyans induced them to move, promising that they would lead them to a better situation. So the Greeks left Aziris and were conducted by the Libyans towards the west, their journey being so arranged, by the calculation of their guides, that they passed in the night the most beautiful district of that whole country, which is the region called Irasa. The Libyans brought them to a spring, which goes by the name of Apollo's Fountain, and told them, \"Here, Hellenes, is the proper place for you to settle; for here the sky leaks.\"\n\nDuring the lifetime of Battus, the founder of the colony, who reigned forty years, and during that of his son Arcesilaus, who reigned sixteen, the Cyreneans continued at the same level, neither more nor fewer in number than they were at the first. But in the reign of the third king, Battus, surnamed the Happy, the advice of the Pythoness brought Greeks from every quarter into Libya, to join the settlement. Thus a great multitude were collected together to Cyrene, and the Libyans of the neighborhood found themselves stripped of large portions of their lands.", "title": "Ancient Greek city of Cyrene", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T02:37:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbtcTb_WMsg", "description": "\u00a9 2006 WMG\nDaniel Powter - Love You Lately (Video)", "title": "Daniel Powter - Love You Lately (Video)", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T01:56:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbtqBnUT8f0", "description": "Take It Home by Jennifer Blosil \n\nNo copyright intended\n\nWhat would happen if we took off our masks\nPeeled back the labels\nTore down the walls we have\nWhat would change if we just saw each other as\nChildren of our father\n\nOut there it's easy to get caught up in our lives\nHere we all can feel the sparks of truth ignite\nWe can keep this feeling burning inside\nIf we carry it ... together\n\nWe have felt the way our hope and faith begins to grow\nWe have felt this light and peace to guide us as we go\nWe know we can take it home\n\nWhat kind of difference can start with you and me\nas we remember to live what we believe\nA mighty change begins with small and simple things\nWe can share with one another\n\nWe have felt the way our hope and faith begins to grow\nWe have felt this light and peace to guide us as we go\nWe know we can take it home\n\nEvery single one of us here has a part\nInside our father's plan and this is where we start\n\nWe have felt the way our hope and faith begins to grow\nWe have felt this light and peace to guide us as we go\nWe know we can take it home\n\nInspired by the Shaytards :)", "title": "Take it home - Jennifer Blosil", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T18:31:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bbu605Rn-FE", "description": "3D animace sol\u00e1rn\u00edch produkt\u016f a p\u0159\u00edslu\u0161enstv\u00ed", "title": "Nelumbo a.s. - 3D animace sol\u00e1rn\u00edch produkt\u016f a p\u0159\u00edslu\u0161enstv\u00ed", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T14:14:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbuJVwauYIU", "description": "Taken at the Fox Theatre, 2013-12-31, NYE", "title": "Oompa Loompa Song - Primus & The Chocolate Factory", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T22:37:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bbun-mIT7s8", "description": "To promote his new book 'Business Stripped Bare', we sent out 8 Nearly Naked Business People over two days to brighten up everybody's commute.\n\nThey braved the awful London weather to hand out Richard Branson business cards and bluetooth sample chapters to people's phones.\n\n'Business Stripped Bare' is out now.\n\nPublished by Virgin Books.", "title": "Richard Branson's Nearly Naked Business People", "publishedDate": "2008-11-11T11:49:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbuzkA-zpLY", "description": "Authorities in Wisconsin have a found a new way to keep their roads clear in the winter.

And yet, a new study called The Silent Treatment reveals that despite the safety interventions taken in the last decade, silence still kills. Safety tools do not compensate for crucial conversations failures in the hospital.\n\nThis video is a dramatization of a true story from the study.\n\nhttp://www.silenttreatmentstudy.com\n\n\n\nDespite interventions made in the last decade to reduce avoidable medical errors caused by poor communication a new study of 6500 nurses found that...silence still kills. \n\nOne nurse shares her true story. \n\n\"I was on a surgical team when I noticed a doctor making a critical error. He was preparing to operate on the wrong side of the patient. Now, we have a surgical safety checklist that we follow and in this case, we noticed that the permit didn't match what the doctor was doing. So, we tried to stop the surgeon but he said the permit was wrong even though it had been verified by the wow sleeping patient. We couldn't even get support from the supervisor or the anesthesiologist. So, in the end, the surgery went forward. As nurses, we felt awful because there was no support from management to stop this doctor. I mean what's the point in having a checklist when it's not even followed?

She gives greater weight to organization and institutionalization than to her vocation to openness.\nIn order to accomplish her true task adequately, the Church must constantly renew the effort to detach herself from the \"worldliness\" of the world. In this she follows the words of Jesus: \"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world\" (Jn 17:16). One could almost say that history comes to the aid of the Church here through the various periods of secularization, which have contributed significantly to her purification and inner reform.\n\nSecularizing trends -- whether by expropriation of Church goods, or elimination of privileges or the like -- have always meant a profound liberation of the Church from forms of worldliness, for in the process she has set aside her worldly wealth and has once again completely embraced her worldly poverty. In this the Church has shared the destiny of the tribe of Levi, which according to the Old Testament account was the only tribe in Israel with no ancestral land of its own, taking as its portion only God himself, his word and his signs. At those moments in history, the Church shared with that tribe the demands of a poverty that was open to the world, in order to be released from her material ties: and in this way her missionary activity regained credibility.\n\nHistory has shown that, when the Church becomes less worldly, her missionary witness shines more brightly. Once liberated from her material and political burdens, the Church can reach out more effectively and in a truly Christian way to the whole world, she can be truly open to the world. She can live more freely her vocation to the ministry of divine worship and service of neighbour. The missionary task, which is linked to Christian worship and should determine its structure, becomes more clearly visible. The Church opens herself to the world not in order to win men for an institution with its own claims to power, but in order to lead them to themselves by leading them to him of whom each person can say with Saint Augustine: he is closer to me than I am to myself (cf. Confessions, III, 6, 11). He who is infinitely above me is yet so deeply within me that he is my true interiority. This form of openness to the world on the Church's part also serves to indicate how the individual Christian can be open to the world in effective and appropriate ways.\n\nIt is not a question here of finding a new strategy to relaunch the Church. Rather, it is a question of setting aside mere strategy and seeking total transparency, not bracketing or ignoring anything from the truth of our present situation, but living the faith fully here and now in the utterly sober light of day, appropriating it completely, and stripping away from it anything that only seems to belong to faith, but in truth is mere convention or habit. To put it another way: for people of every era, not just our own, the Christian faith is a scandal. That the eternal God should know us and care about us, that the intangible should at a particular moment have become tangible, that he who is immortal should have suffered and died on the Cross, that we who are mortal should be given the promise of resurrection and eternal life -- to believe all this is to posit something truly remarkable.\n\nThis scandal, which cannot be eliminated unless one were to eliminate Christianity itself, has unfortunately been overshadowed in recent times by other painful scandals on the part of the preachers of the faith. A dangerous situation arises when these scandals take the place of the primary skandalon of the Cross and in so doing they put it beyond reach, concealing the true demands of the Christian Gospel behind the unworthiness of those who proclaim it.\n\nAll the more, then, is it time once again for the Church resolutely to set aside her worldliness. That does not mean withdrawing from the world. A Church relieved of the burden of worldliness is in a position, not least through her charitable activities, to mediate the life-giving strength of the Christian faith to those in need, to sufferers and to their carers. \"For the Church, charity is not a kind of welfare activity which could equally well be left to others, but is a part of her nature, an indispensable expression of her very being\" (Deus Caritas Est, 25). At the same time, though, the Church's charitable activity also needs to be constantly exposed to the demands of due detachment from worldliness, if it is not to wither away at the roots in the face of increasing erosion of its ecclesial character. Only a profound relationship with God makes it possible to reach out fully towards others, just as a lack of ...\n\nhttp://www.news.va/en/news/pope-benedict-addresses-catholics-working-for-the-", "title": "Pope  What can the Church do stop decline in religious practice", "publishedDate": "2011-09-25T21:16:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcJHYyGy1Do", "description": "Watch the Original Trailer Here: http://goo.gl/PyZ0E\n\nSubscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nPitch Perfect - Ultimate Mashup (2012) - Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Movie HD\n\nA comedy set in the middle of a war between rival a cappella groups and centered on a rebellious girl who joins one of the groups as an escape from her unhappy life at school.\n\n\"Pitch Perfect trailer\" \"Pitch Perfect movie\" \"Pitch Perfect HD\" HD 2012 \"Anna Kendrick\" \"Brittany Snow\" \"Rebel Wilson\" \"Jason Moore\" \"Mickey Rapkin\" \"Christopher Mintz-Plasse\" \"leslie mann\" \"ultimate trailer\" \"ultimate a cappella trailer\" movie clips movieclipstrailers movieclips movieclipsDOTcom movieclipscomingsoon jjohenning", "title": "Pitch Perfect - Ultimate Mashup (2012) - Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Movie HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-04T18:05:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcJokFTAL60", "description": "Andrea and her family have migrated permanently from the UK and are happily settled in the coastal town of Geelong through the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS). \nRSMS allows employers in regional areas of Australia, to sponsor employees who are foreign nationals for a permanent visa to work in Australia. \n\nTo find out more visit http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/skilled-workers/rsms/", "title": "Skilled Migrant Profile", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T02:21:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcJzBptzRAw", "description": "Somnus\nhttp://shag.bandcamp.com/album/somnus\nhttps://soundcloud.com/garsidetogo\n\nFilm: A Deer of Nine Colors.", "title": "Shag - Lady", "publishedDate": "2014-02-19T07:29:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcK-sqiQD6U", "description": "Aquatic and Invasive Plant Identification Series by the UF/IFAS Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants ( http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu ) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, Invasive Plant Management Section. \n\nFor more information about carrotwood, go to http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/node/399\n\nVideo editor/videographer - Phil Chiocchio", "title": "Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (Syn.

In the novel, it is described as being \"the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year.\" Orwell included an essay about it in the form of an appendix[1] in which the basic principles of the language are explained. Newspeak is closely based on English but has a greatly reduced and simplified vocabulary and grammar.

These values gained prominence in China over other doctrines, such as Legalism (\u6cd5\u5bb6) or Taoism (\u9053\u5bb6) during the Han Dynasty[3][4][5] (206 BC -- 220 AD). Confucius' thoughts have been developed into a system of philosophy known as Confucianism (\u5112\u5bb6). It was introduced to Europe by the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci, who was the first to Latinise the name as \"Confucius\".\nHis teachings may be found in the Analects of Confucius (\u8ad6\u8a9e), a collection of \"brief aphoristic fragments\", which was compiled many years after his death. For nearly 2,000 years he was thought to be the editor or author of all the Five Classics (\u4e94\u7d93)[6][7] such as the Classic of Rites (\u79ae\u8a18) (editor), and the Spring and Autumn Annals (\u6625\u79cb) (author).\nKong Qiu (\u5b54\u4e18), as Confucius is commonly known, is a combination of his surname (\u5b54) and his given name (\u4e18), and he was also known as Zhong Ni (\u4ef2\u5c3c), which is his courtesy name. He was born in 551 BC in the Lu state[8] (This state was in the south of modern-day Shandong Province) in the later days of the Spring and Autumn Period. Confucius was from a warrior family. His father Shulianghe (\u53d4\u6881\u7d07) was a famous warrior who had military exploits in two battles and owned a fiefdom. Confucius lost his father when he was three years old, and then his mother Yan Zhengzai (\u984f\u5fb5\u5728) took him and left the fiefdom because as a concubine (\u59be), she wanted to avoid mistreatment from Shulianghe's formal wife. Thus, Confucius lived in poverty with his mother since childhood. With the support and encouragement of his mother, Confucius was very diligent in his studies. When Confucius was seventeen years old, his mother died as a result of illness and overwork. Three years later, Confucius married a young woman who was from the Qiguan family (\u4e93\u5b98\u6c0f) of the Song state (\u5b8b) . Though he had a mild tempered wife who loved him, he left his family to strive for his ideals. Confucius sought to revive the perfect virtue of Huaxia (Chinese civilization) and the classical properties of the Western Zhou Dynasty to build a great, harmonious and humanistic society.\n\nFollow on Twitter-\nVivian Kellie @pudersknockouts -model\nGeorge Walker @rawstarr -Marketing/promotions\n\nProducer: Vivian Kellie\nMarketing by George Rawstarr Walker in association with Rawstarr Communications rawstarrcommunications.com\nEditor: David Medill", "title": "Sweet & Sexy Model wants to know what do you like?", "publishedDate": "2010-11-16T08:52:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcbDfqsGU6c", "description": "Winemaker Rob Davis sources grapes from top local growers to blend with the finest lots of Jordan estate grapes to make our Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.

Se hace cl\u00ednicamente evidente cuando la bilirrubina es mayor de 2 a 2,5 mg/dl. Este aumento puede ser a expensas de la fracci\u00f3n no conjugada o \"indirecta\" de la bilirrubina (BI); \u00e9sta es liposoluble y no se filtra por el ri\u00f1\u00f3n, por lo que no aparece coluria. Cuando el aumento es a expensas de la bilirrubina conjugada o \"directa\" (BD), al ser \u00e9sta hidrosoluble, se filtra por el ri\u00f1\u00f3n, apareciendo coluria. Puede haber aumentos de ambas fracciones y se habla entonces de hiperbilirrubinemia mixta. La bilirrubina no conjugada es la relacionada a ictericia prehep\u00e1tica y no hay coluria ni acolia, mientras que la bilirrubina conjugada est\u00e1 relacionada a la ictericia hep\u00e1tica y post hep\u00e1tica.\n\nTipos  [editar]Existen tres tipos principales de ictericia: prehep\u00e1tica, hep\u00e1tica y post hep\u00e1tica.\n\nLa ictericia prehep\u00e1tica se debe a la liberaci\u00f3n de bilirrubina no conjugada por destrucci\u00f3n de eritrocitos (anemia hemol\u00edtica) o por el aumento de bilirrubina libre a causa de bajos niveles de alb\u00famina, su principal transportador (hipoalbuminemia). Algunos ejemplos son la enfermedad de Gilbert, la hem\u00f3lisis debido a esplenomegalia y la eritropoyesis inefectiva. \nLa ictericia hep\u00e1tica se debe a problemas con el \u00e1rbol biliar dentro del h\u00edgado que puede ser por destrucci\u00f3n de los hepatocitos, as\u00ed como alteraciones del flujo por estos conductos. Algunos ejemplos son la cirrosis hep\u00e1tica, la hepatitis viral aguda y la hepatitis cr\u00f3nica. \nLa ictericia post hep\u00e1tica se debe a la obstrucci\u00f3n del col\u00e9doco (Colestasis), ya sea por un c\u00e1lculo a nivel de la ves\u00edcula biliar o incluso por la compresi\u00f3n originada por un c\u00e1ncer de cabeza de p\u00e1ncreas. Algunos ejemplos son la coledocolitiasis y el c\u00e1ncer de cabeza de p\u00e1ncreas. \n\n Observaciones a considerar en los tipos de ictericia  [editar]\n Ictericia prehep\u00e1tica  [editar]Si se realiza un perfil hep\u00e1tico, no se ven alteradas las enzimas indicadoras de da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico. Por lo tanto los niveles de aminotransferazas (ALAT y ASAT) estar\u00e1n normales al igual que los niveles de Fosfatasa Alcalina.\n\nEn pacientes que cursan con ictericia prehep\u00e1tica, su orina es de un color rojizo producto de la hemoglobina presente. El ri\u00f1\u00f3n estar\u00e1 en riesgo ya que la hemoglobina a nivel renal es t\u00f3xica.\n\n\n Ictericia hep\u00e1tica  [editar]En este tipo de ictericia los niveles de ALAT y ASAT estar\u00e1n elevados pero no as\u00ed la fosfatasa alcalina, esta \u00faltima solo podr\u00eda verse elevada si producto de una inflamaci\u00f3n de hepatocitos ocurre una obstrucci\u00f3n del canal\u00edculo biliar, provocando una colestasis (la fosfatasa alcalina no es exclusiva para indicar que hay colestasis, tambi\u00e9n se ve alterada en otros procesos patol\u00f3gicos no relacionados a la ictericia.)\n\nLa orina en estos pacientes se torna de un color oscuro similar al del caf\u00e9 y en estos casos al igual que en la orina roja producto de la hemoglobina, el ri\u00f1\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n estar\u00e1 en riesgo de fallar.\n\n\n Ictericia posthep\u00e1tica  [editar]Existir\u00e1 una hipertensi\u00f3n del \u00e1rbol biliar, porque se bloquea el pasaje de bilirrubina al intestino. Los niveles de fosfatasa alcalina estar\u00e1n elevados, esto es indicador de que est\u00e1 ocurriendo una colestasis intra-hep\u00e1tica o extra-hep\u00e1tica. El color de la orina en este caso es igual que en la ictericia hep\u00e1tica, y las heces son acolicas o hipocolicas.\n\nJaundice, also known as icterus (attributive adjective: icteric), is a yellowish discoloration of the skin, the conjunctival membranes over the sclerae (whites of the eyes), and other mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia (increased levels of bilirubin in the blood). This hyperbilirubinemia subsequently causes increased levels of bilirubin in the extracellular fluids. Typically, the concentration of bilirubin in the plasma must exceed 1.5 mg/dL[1], three times the usual value of approximately 0.5mg/dL[1], for the coloration to be easily visible. Jaundice comes from the French word jaune, meaning yellow.", "title": "Hepatitis Viral: Ictericia de Conjuntivas, piel y mucosas", "publishedDate": "2009-08-27T02:27:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "BcmV7IgN16U", "description": "R.

An attacking midfielder known for the quality of his passing and his free kicks, Panenka played for Bohemians Prague for most of his career, joining the club as a youth in 1959. He came to international prominence playing for Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship in Belgrade, former Yugoslavia (now Serbia); Czechoslovakia reached the final, where they faced Germany. After extra time, the result was 2-2, and so the first penalty shootout in a European Championships final ensued. All the kicks were converted, until Germany's fourth penalty taker, Uli Hoene\u00df, ballooned his shot over the bar. With the score 4-3, Panenka stepped up to take the fifth and final Czechoslovakian penalty, to win the match. Despite the immense pressure, he fooled German goalkeeper Sepp Maier into diving for a save, before coolly chipping the ball straight down the middle and into the net[1]. The sheer cheek of the goal led a watching French journalist to dub Panenka \"a poet\", and to this day his winning kick is one of the most famous ever, making Panenka's synonymous with that particular style of penalty kick.\n\nAnton\u00edn Panenka (* 2. prosince 1948) je b\u00fdval\u00fd \u010deskoslovensk\u00fd fotbalov\u00fd reprezentant, mistr evropy z B\u011blehradu 1976. Panenka nastoupil poprv\u00e9 k ligov\u00e9mu z\u00e1pasu v necel\u00fdch dvaceti letech za Bohemians Praha.

Where incomes are growing and inequality is increasing, cities like New York and San Francisco, rising prices and rents can displace poor families. But affordable housing secures a place for low-income people in communities with growing tax bases and improved services. Having access to better schools, good transportation networks, recreational facilities, and other community services enables families to improve their quality of life and provide greater opportunities for their children. \n\nUnfortunately, affordable housing is a scarce resource in many cities.

It is currently considered to be one of the neglected tropical diseases; less common than tuberculosis but more common than leprosy. The initial lesion is a painless subcutaneous nodule, usually less than 5 cm diameter and adherent to skin. The nodule typically breaks down centrally after days to weeks forming an ulcer with undermined edges. Thus, the external appearance of the ulcer underestimates the true size of the affected area. The patient remains well and there is no pain unless secondary bacterial infection occurs. Other forms of M. ulcerans disease include a firm plaque lesions that behaves in the same way as the nodule or an oedematous lesion that is more aggressive and extends rapidly resulting in a very large ulcer.\n\nAny age group can be affected by Buruli ulcer diseases, but the incidence peaks at 5 to 15 years. Ulcers are most frequently on the limbs but can be on the trunk or head, sometimes with catastrophic consequences such as loss of sight or loss of breast or genital tissue. Healing close to a joint can result in contracture, and sometimes there is so much tissue destruction on a limb that amputation is unavoidable. Occasionally osteomyelitis occurs in bone adjacent to a skin lesion but involvement of other organs is rare.

This automatic update to GTA Online adds five new options to the Los Santos real estate market at prime locations like Eclipse Towers, Richards Majestic and others, all featuring the latest new interior design. With multi-property ownership, you'll also now be able to own two distinct properties simultaneously.\n\nFor those looking to take advantage of the expanded garage space that comes with owning an extra property, there's a trio of exquisite new cars plus a hot new motorcycle to add to your collection. The Enus Huntley S (SUV), Dewbauchee Massacro (Sports), Pegassi Zentorno (Super) and Dinka Thrust (Motorcycle) will all be available to purchase in GTA Online from Legendary Motorsport - and accessible from any garage property in Story Mode. The High Life Update also adds 'Non Contact' to the bevy of available Race options, which will allow you to play standard Races with collisions disabled between player's vehicles (other players appear as semi-transparent and you'll still be able to collide with non-player traffic, structures and other scenery).\n\nYou can also protect your investments with Ammu-Nation's latest arrival, the powerful Bullpup Rifle. And the new Mental State player stat shows you just how passive or psychotically unhinged fellow players in your session really are -- so you'll know if you need to have it at the ready when they approach. The High Life Update also includes new wardrobe options, vehicle horns and player toasts/celebrations as well as 15 new Jobs - including 5 new Contact Missions.\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52245/GTA-Online-The-High-Life-Update-Coming-Next-Week-Tuesday\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Shirt today! \nhttp://joblessgamers.spreadshirt.com/\n\nMy Minecraft Channel:\nhttp://bit.ly/CraftyGarrett\n\n\nMy Social Media Links:\nhttp://Facebook.com/JoblessGamers\nhttp://Twitter.com/Garrett_sutton\nhttp://instagram.com/Garrett_Sutton_\n\nLIVESTREAM: \nhttp://Twitch.tv/JoblessGamers\n\n\n\n\nMusic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SuperstaarBeats\nSoundclick: http://www.soundclick.com/SuperstaarB...\nGmail: superstaarbeats@gmail.com\nTwitter: @SuperstaarBeats\nhttp://www.twitter.com/SuperstaarBeats", "title": "GTA 5 Online New High Life DLC 500k Apartment Showcase - New Apartment Interiors", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T14:46:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bd7ps9cOkvM", "description": "Onderzoek naar effecten van drijvend bouwen\n\nTauw heeft samen met oa Deltasync en Deltares een landelijk onderzoek opgezet naar de effecten van drijvend bouwen op de waterkwaliteit en ecologie.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals, while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gameteCopulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring.

A certain combination of traits makes it unique among its kind\u2014it is the world's only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low basal metabolic rate, no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds.[4] Its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands, with few predators and abundant food: a generally robust physique, with accretion of thermodynamic efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, reduced wing muscles, and a diminished keel on the sternum.[4] Like many other New Zealand bird species, the Kakapo was historically important to the M\u0101ori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore. It was hunted and used as a resource by M\u0101ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. It was also sometimes kept as a pet.\n \nThe Kakapo is critically endangered; as of February 2012, only 126[5] living individuals are known,[6] most of which have been given names.[7] Because of Polynesian and European colonisation and the introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats, the Kakapo was almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s.

They are distinctive among the cranes, adults are nearly all snowy white, except for their black primary feathers that are visible in flight and with two breeding populations in the Arctic tundra of western and eastern Russia. The eastern populations migrate during winter to China while the western population winters in Iran and formerly, in India. Among the cranes, they make the longest distance migrations. Their populations, particularly those in the western range, have declined drastically in the 20th century due to hunting along their migration routes and habitat degradation. The world population was estimated in 2010 at about 3,200 birds, mostly belonging to the eastern population with about 95% of them wintering in the Poyang lake basin in China, a habitat that may be altered by the Three Gorges Dam. In western Siberia there are only around ten of these cranes in the wild.\n\nSiberian Cranes are widely dispersed in their breeding areas and are highly territorial. They maintain feeding territories in winter but may form small and loose flocks, and gather closer at their winter roosts. They are very diurnal, feeding almost all throughout the day. When feeding on submerged vegetation, they often immerse their heads entirely underwater. When calling, the birds stretch their neck forward.\n\nThese cranes feed mainly on plants although they are omnivorous. In the summer grounds they feed on a range of plants including the roots of hellebore (Veratrum misae), seeds of Empetrum nigrum as well as small rodents (lemmings and voles), earthworms and fish. They were earlier thought to be predominantly fish eating on the basis of the serrated edge to their bill, but later studies suggest that they take animal prey mainly when the vegetation is covered by snow. They also swallow pebbles and grit to aid in crushing food in their crop.\n\nThese snow Cranes return to the Arctic tundra around the end of April and beginning of May. The nest is usually on the edge of lake in boggy ground and is usually surrounded by water. Most eggs are laid in the first week of June when the tundra is snow free. The usual clutch is two eggs, which are incubated by the female after the second egg is laid. The male stands guard nearby. The eggs hatch in about 27 to 29 days. The young birds fledge in about 80 days. Usually only a single chick survives due to aggression between young birds. The population increase per year is less than 10%, the lowest recruitment rate among cranes. Their success in breeding may further be hampered by disturbance from reindeer and sometimes dogs that accompany reindeer herders.\n\nThis species breeds in two disjunct regions in the arctic tundra of Russia; the western population along the Ob Yakutia and western Siberia. It is a long distance migrant and among the cranes, makes the longest migrations. The eastern population winters on the Yangtze River and Lake Poyang in China, and the western population in Fereydoon Kenar in Iran and Keoladeo National Park, India.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Crane\n\nThis video taken from Alipore Zoo at the time of visiting myself in April, 2014.

This exercise is many names, I've heard them all - skull crusher, nose breaker, line tricep extention. It's all the same thing. \n\nFor the most part, I like to use bar, which is the zig zag bar. You can use a straight bar. Some people even use dumbbells for it. \n\nYou're going to perform it on the bench. You could have the bench angled if you'd like, I'm going to perform it on a flat bench. It'll just change the angle of the muscle that you're working. \n\nNow, this is the skull crusher, you're going to be working your triceps, that's the primary muscle of this exercise. It's one of the basic and best exercises for your triceps. \n\nWith this I want to try to explain it before I show you so it's not all awkward. You're going to be lying down, and you're going to have a moderate grip, close grip, I would say at least thumbs distance apart. You're going to lower the bar to your forehead, which is literally why it's called the skull crusher. Come up, extend, and squeeze your triceps. \n\nNow, you don't want to lock your triceps out completely because that could injure your joint. So you're going to keep it like that. You're going to come up, extend, squeeze, control, and then bring it back down. If it's too heavy, there's likely a chance that you're going to knock yourself in the head and crush your skull. Not to that point, but you get what I mean. \n\nGoing into performance, anytime you do a line exercise, you want to make sure that you have what I call the six points of contact. Right foot, left foot, butt, shoulder blade, shoulder blade, head. All six points you want touching and well stable. Otherwise, if you're unstable, unbalanced, you could cause injury to yourself. \n\nYou're going to start at the top. As you come down, elbows in place, elbows locked in place down to the forehead. Don't hit yourself, come up, extend the tricep, squeeze the tricep. \n\nStretch breathe in. Anytime you're working against gravity, breathe out. I'm pushing against gravity, breathe out. Release, inhale, breathe out. \n\nThere's different variations of this. You can bring it further away from your head, that makes the stretch that much harder. It puts you at less of a leverage, so it's harder to extend that tricep. So, with this, you get more of a stretch. I prefer it more as a size exercise. \n\nTo come almost back behind your head, really stretch that muscle. Extend it up and always keep it over your eyes. That's my rule, so it's eyes to over. Make sure your grip is firm on that bar, the last thing you want to do is drop it on yourself. Then your elbows, you don't want to flare them out. \n\nAs you're doing this, if it's too heavy of a weight we see a lot of guys, as they come down, flare their elbows out, and bring it down then come back up. That's cheating the exercise, keep your elbows forward. Come down, you'll get that full stretch. Elbows forward, extend, squeeze, and that is your skull crusher.

Braddock heads back into Vietnam through Parachute deployment and with the help of an Australian C-47 pilot. After parachute descent, Braddock outruns Vietnamese Navy Patrol Boats with a Jet-Powered speedboat.\n\nReverend Polanski leads Braddock to Lin and Van. Attempting to flee the country, Braddock, Lin, and Van are captured by the soldiers of General Quoc (Aki Aleong). Quoc kills Lin on the spot, and has his soldiers take Braddock and Van to a compound to be tortured.\n\nLater, Braddock overpowers his guards, frees Van, and heads for the mission that is run by Polanski. Quoc anticipates the move and takes all the mission children into captivity, along with Van and Polanski, and Braddock sets out to free them all from Quoc by going to his weapons cache that he had hidden a few days prior. He equips himself with a modified Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle with an underslung 6-shot rotary grenade launcher and attachments including a spring-loaded bayonet. He raids the camp killing the guards and loading up one of the trucks with all the children including his son, Van and the Reverend. Soon after escaping they are followed and attacked by a Vietnamese-captured American UH-1 Huey. When they escape Braddock takes the children on foot and find a Vietnamese airstrip. Braddock silently takes out the guards and hijacks a C-47 Dakota plane. The plane is then assaulted by Vietnamese guards causing fuel to leak out of the plane, eventually crashing just outside the Cambodian-Thailand border. Braddock then raids the border station where American and Thailand troops are watching on the other side cheering Braddock on. When Braddock kills all the opposing troops more pour in. Braddock is injured by a grenade. When General Quoc then flies in on a Vietnamese Mil-24 Hind gunship thinking he has Braddock all to himself, two American helicopters on the side of the Thai border confront Quoc's gunship. Taunting each other to cross, Braddock and his son Van fire at Quoc's ship hitting the pilot and the Gunship crashes, killing Quoc. Then all the American troops pour over the border and bridge and help the wounded Braddock and the children.\n[edit] Cast\n\n    Chuck Norris as Col.

The game was funded through Kickstarter and is a prequel to Divine Divinity.\n\nGameplay\nOriginal Sin will be the next RPG in the Divinity universe. Divinity: Original Sin concerns two heroes: a condemned warrior released from his chains and a mystic heroine restored to life. The game touts turn-based combat, cooperative multiplayer, a highly interactive world and will ship with a full-fledged modding tool.\n\nDevelopment\nOriginal Sin was expected to be released in October of November \n2013, but was delayed to 28 February, 2014.

However, they eventually decided to delay the Mac and Linux versions to focus on gameplay; when those versions are released they will be free to anyone with the Windows version of the game.\n\nIt later turned out that the Mac version would be available on the date of release. \n\nLarian wanted to do a turn based game before, but the publisher they were working with always withheld them from doing so.", "title": "Divinity: Original Sin - Armoury Key & Rat Poison (Hunter's Edge) Walkthrough", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T12:14:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BeFWFPT-zFI", "description": "Le Bad Trip : se r\u00e9veiller, sans souvenir, avec une cicatrice..\nPage du Film \u27a8 http://advitamdistribution.com/ablations\n\u2713 Abonne-toi \u00e0 Filmsactu sur Youtube : http://bit.ly/19S2Dsq\n\u27a8 Rejoignez-nous sur Facebook http://facebook.com/Filmsactu \nAmateur d'Horreur ?

It is all done in order to maintain an artificially created Jewish majority among Israeli citizenship holders while completely disregarding the rights and welfare of the underprivileged under Israeli ethnocracy.\n\nThis plan and the rational behind it, along with its arrogance, doesn't care about Israel's image in the eyes of the world. The disrespect of international law and norms which allows for this type of thinking is also shared by so called liberal-Zionists who would similarly like to maintain an artificially created Jewish majority at all costs. The liberal-Zionists, on the other hand, are more concerned about their image in the world and would therefore refuse to annex more inhabited Palestinian land into Israel. Their means of maintaining Jewish ethnic-supremacy is therefore different than the suggested annexation plan.\n\nMore at The Zionist Extravaganza: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_8tW7z3sGA\n\n====\n\nThe rights-based approach:\nWhen discussing people's rights, even the most modest and mainstream approach would have to agree on 3 fundamental and inalienable rights of the 3 groups of Palestinians - those residing in the OPT, those who constitute 20% of the citizens of Israel and those who are still in forced exile.\n\nEach of these groups' rights should be respected by:\n1.

We are the Servants of Our Creators and our sacred duty involves giving mankind a chance to find its way in the universe.\n \nThere is a paucity of literature on the subject of protection and defense against the dark arts. The primary principle of understanding just what the dark arts are and applying the principles of applied thaumaturgy, divine elemental control, the correct use of crystalline herbal potions, defense against nest of consciousness, the use of The Triamterah, understanding the 40 different light and dark elements, and basic high magic principles are all necessary to understanding defense against the dark arts.\n \nThis text is designed to help mankind learn the higher principles of defense against the dark arts. This basic text is taught to all of the soldiers among my people who protect and defend the lower worlds.  I have written many such texts as primers in order to help defenders in training learn the ways of the warrior.\n \nThis is the first time that this text will be made available to humans. Unknown to most humans, this world is in the midst of a subtle-battle of good versus evil also known as Armageddon. This battle is being fought mostly in the subtle-dimension in all the regions of the universe including the Earth region. The fraction of this battle that will play out in the physical plane could have catastrophic consequences for the human race. Tools such as this book have the possibility of reducing the effect of this war on humankind.  If only a small fraction of humans undertake the serious practice of learning true protection against the forces of Shadow, the planet may yet be saved.", "title": "Defense Against the Dark Arts- A New Magical Text", "publishedDate": "2014-09-26T00:06:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bee_SiNX5DU", "description": "G20 leaders are meeting in Brisbane, Australia, to discuss ways of boosting global economic growth.

To make things easier we thought we would put together a video showing some  Cape Town attractions you might be interested in seeing. \n\nThere are few places in the world where you can get up close to penguins like you can at Boulders Beach. This penguin colony is near Simonstown. There are two sections, one with boardwalks and viewing areas. The other allows visitors to share a beach with penguins. \n\nCamps Bay is one of the trendiest parts of Cape Town. It has a great beach, plenty of restaurants and a terrific view on the sunsets.  It is set against the Twelve Apostles. This is a mountain ridge that joins with Table Mountain, which separates Camps Bay from the centre of Cape Town. \n\nThe Victoria and Alfred Watefront (or V and A) is the most popular attraction South Africa with regard to numbers. It has a good choice of restaurants, bars, shops and  accommodation. Many of Cape Town's top hotels are here. \nIf you want to visit Nelson Mandela's prison cell on Robben Island you can catch a boat from here. \n\nCape Town is surrounded by the  Cape Winelands. There are mountains and valleys so the scenery is worth the visit by itself.  You can also stop at winefarms for tasting sessions. The oldest winefarm, Groot Constantia,  is in the Constantia area. \n\nHout Bay is within easy reach of the city centre and still operates as a fishing port.  The best way to reach here is by taking the scenic Chapman's Peak drive. There are boat tours here to Seal Island just off the coast.  This is a seal colony on a rocky outcrop. \n\nFor nature-lovers there is also Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. This sits on the slopes of Devil's Peak and is again not far from Cape Town city centre. It has only indigenous plants and many Capetonians bring picnics here or enjoy one of the concerts held in the gardens. \n\nCompany's Garden is a park in the centre of Cape Town. Around it are museums and the Parliament Building. This is where early Dutch settlers grew fruit and vegetables for passing ships. It is within reach of the bars of Long Street. \n\nCape Point is situated in the world heritage site that is the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. It has an incredible range of flora and fauna.  This is where many of the early explorers landed. You can go to the lighthouse and look down on the tip of the peninsula. \n\nTable Mountain dominates the skyline in Cape Town. You can either hike up to the top or take a cable car.  The top is flat(hence the name) so you can take a number of walking trails, but make sure you check the weather ahead of your visit. \n\nAt http://www.sightseer.tv/capetown we have dozens of video guides on Cape Town. We also have information on Cape Town hotels and accommodation.", "title": "Cape Town - Top 10 things to do", "publishedDate": "2011-10-20T08:25:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BektJdMeHVc", "description": "Great iPad app for kids that like Barney\nDownload: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barneys-storybook-treasury/id556065977?mt=8\nPricing: Free\n\nBarney's Storybook Treasury App\n\nBarney's Storybook Treasury stars the beloved purple dinosaur and includes three of Barney's favorite stories for young readers.

Now we bring you live images and our first impressions of the beastly, all-American luxury SUV.\n\nOver the weekend at the Miami International Auto Show  , we had the chance to climb inside the completely redesigned Escalade to see the improvements first hand. The Escalade is based on its GM cousins, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban  , along with the GMC Yukon   and Yukon XL. Across the board, the interiors are much improved in regards to roominess and use of space. Finally for the first time, the full-size General Motors SUVs have folding rear seats that allow for a flat load floor.\n\nThe second row has grown two inches in the footwell for added ease of entry and exit for taller, larger-footed passengers. Their height won't be a problem inside either, as headroom is quite generous throughout the cabin. The Escalade we sampled was equipped with the second-row captains chairs. The center aisle was wide enough for easy access to the third row and the nearly flat floor kept tripping hazards to the minimum.\n\nUp front, the driver is treated to the same huge TFT display found in the Cadillac CTS and XTS. Real wood trim is abundant and contrasts nicely with the soft leather seating. Fit and finish is unmatched by any Cadillacs of past. Gaps and seams were tight even and intricate details abound throughout the cabin. The details continue outside with etched Cadillac crests appearing within the clear plastic tail lamps.\n\nSuch details were a welcome addition to what will assuredly be a home run for General Motors.\nThe Escalade is indubitably related to its GM cousins, but certainly has its own look and presence. The large grille is more subtle with less \"bling\" than in years past. Such a refine, mature look will likely appeal to a more affluent crowd who had overlooked the Escalade due to the inherent ostentatiousness.\n\nThe distinctive Cadillac taillights are quickly noticeable and closely tie the Escalade to Cadillac's other vehicles. The rear bumper is more smooth and contoured looking while the rear hatch looks rather stately. The rear window wiper hides cleverly just below the third brake light. Also hidden is the standard two-inch trailer hitch receiver. Like in years past, it resides behind a body-colored plastic access panel in the rear bumper.\n\n Read more http://www.topspeed.com/cars/cadillac/2015-cadillac-escaladefirst-impressions-ar161168.html", "title": "2015 Cadillac Escalade Test Drive", "publishedDate": "2014-01-03T08:24:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bf-07gEvKAY", "description": "Director:  Asif Younis\nWriter: Syed Wasi Shah\nProducer: Six Sigma\nCast: Meekal, Urwa, Saba Hamid, Waseem Abbas, Huma Hamid, Rashid Mahmood, Uzma Hassan, Kiran Haq, Sohail Sameer etc \n\nWatch our official channels:\nhttp://blogs.humnetwork.com \nhttp://vod.humnetwork.com \nhttps://www.facebook.com/humtvpakistan \nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/humtv \nhttps://www.youtube.com/HumNetwork\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HumTVZGH\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HumtvDileMuztar\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HumsafarHumnetwork", "title": "Tum Meray He Rehna Episode 12 Promo HUM TV Drama", "publishedDate": "2014-11-19T16:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bf-GGLKq3FA", "description": "Beautiful song on Elephant for Kids\n\nElephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Traditionally, two species are recognised; the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. They are the only surviving proboscideans; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). These animals have several distinctive features, including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes; particularly for grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging, and weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of their bodies. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (or \"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The latter are led by the oldest cow, known as the matriarch. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (or \"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.\n\nSubscribe link \nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Rhyme4Kids", "title": "Beautiful song on Elephant for Kids", "publishedDate": "2012-04-21T09:17:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bf-gRNE0uDs", "description": "Hello hello my Autumn Sunshine,\n\nHere is another quick hair tutorial for you all.

The earliest known turtles date from 215 million years ago,[2] making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards, snakes and crocodiles. Of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered.\nLike other reptiles, turtles are ectotherms\u2014their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called cold-blooded. However, leatherback sea turtles have noticeably higher body temperature than surrounding water because of their high metabolic rate.\nThe largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), which reaches a shell length of 200 centimetres (6.6 ft) and can reach a weight of over 900 kilograms (2,000 lb). Freshwater turtles are generally smaller, but with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii, a few individuals have been reported up to 200 centimetres (6.6 ft). This dwarfs even the better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America, which attains a shell length of up to 80 centimetres (2.6 ft) and weighs as much as 113.4 kilograms (250 lb).[4] Giant tortoises of the genera Geochelone, Meiolania, and others were relatively widely distributed around the world into prehistoric times, and are known to have existed in North and South America, Australia, and Africa. They became extinct at the same time as the appearance of man, and it is assumed humans hunted them for food. The only surviving giant tortoises are on the Seychelles and Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, and can grow to over 130 centimetres (51 in) in length, and weigh about 300 kilograms (660 lb).\nThe largest ever chelonian was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle known to have been up to 4.6 metres (15 ft) long.\nThe smallest turtle is the speckled padloper tortoise of South Africa. It measures no more than 8 centimetres (3.1 in) in length and weighs about 140 grams (4.9 oz). Two other species of small turtles are the American mud turtles and musk turtles that live in an area that ranges from Canada to South America. The shell length of many species in this group is less than 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in length.\nTurtles are divided into two groups, according to how they evolved a solution to the problem of withdrawing their necks into their shells: the Cryptodira, which can draw their necks in while contracting it under their spine; and the Pleurodira, which contract their necks to the side.\nAlthough many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air, and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. They can also spend much of their lives on dry land. Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections. These projections, called papillae, have a rich blood supply, and increase the surface area of the cloaca. The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae, in much the same way that fish use gills to respire.\nTurtles lay eggs, like other reptiles, which are slightly soft and leathery. The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are elongated. Their albumen is white and contains a different protein from bird eggs, such that it will not coagulate when cooked. Turtle eggs prepared to eat consist mainly of yolk. In some species, temperature determines whether an egg develops into a male or a female: a higher temperature causes a female, a lower temperature causes a male. Large numbers of eggs are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then covered and left to incubate by themselves. When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water. There are no known species in which the mother cares for the young.Sea turtles lay their eggs on dry, sandy beaches. Immature sea turtles are not cared for by the adults. Turtles can take many years to reach breeding age, and in many cases breed every few years rather than annually.\nFor regular updates on the latest happenings kindly subscribe www.youtube.com/AnimalsLoveLife", "title": "Snapping Turtle Laying Egg", "publishedDate": "2013-05-11T20:19:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bf6wgQEzks0", "description": "Warren Buffett says that distressed assets are a great investment in an interview with Charlie Rose.

Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term \"shark\" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago. Since then, sharks have diversified into over 470 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive in both seawater and freshwater. They breathe through five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth. Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators\u2014organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. In 2006 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) megalodon undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3. Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, cow frilled dogfish dog sawsharks saw angel bullhead carpet ground mackarel ray rays tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack mako makos and kill people.

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters. To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450--420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments. Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee", "title": "Shark tries to attack young girl CAUGHT ON CAMERA!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T10:07:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "BfWNidbf08U", "description": "Azat King Ervin Ahmet FetJoe", "title": "Azat King & Ervin & FetJoe Ragga Dagga 2 Official Audio 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T16:28:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "BfWjgT7PKKU", "description": "Haharangin ng samahan ng mga empleyado ng gobyerno ang appointment ng manikurista ni Pangulong Arroyo bilang miyembro ng Board of Trustees ng Pag-ibig Fund.

The most common risk factors and problems that lead up to it are basically threefold. We know that addictions are what we call biological, psychological and a social disease. The biological thing, factor has to deal with the fact that addictions tend to run in families so that if your father or your grandfather or your mother or your grandmother suffer, or even an aunt, suffer from an addiction, the chances of you developing an addiction issue are greatly increased. We also know that there are certain psychological conditions that people who suffer from addictions and who suffer from substance abuse have. These typically are, number one is anxiety, that people have a sense of anxiety in their life. They feel uncomfortable in their skin. There's also a huge number of people who suffer from depression. They feel like they're walking through a fog. They don't really feel engaged in the world. They're, they're sad, they're lethargic, they're tired. They use substances and become addicted to substances to change the way that they feel. We also know that there's a sociological aspect to addiction, and that has to do with the society and the culture that we live in. It also has to deal with the family that we grew up in because if dad comes home from work and pours himself a drink to deal with a stressful day, then junior learns that alcohol is the way that I manage stress and uncomfortable feelings. So again, it's a biological, psychological and social condition and we need to take a look at each and every one of those and we need to take a look at each and every one of those in order to figure out, not just where the addiction came from, but how we can find a solution to it.", "title": "Causes of Substance Abuse & Addiction | Addictions", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T10:30:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BfXuz0c_PW0", "description": "Check out the best highlights FOX has to offer from week 2 of the college football season.", "title": "Best of College Football Saturday - Week 2", "publishedDate": "2014-09-07T08:49:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BfYUnUmxGEU", "description": "It's time for the group to ice their buns, but some are finding it more difficult than others.

Dr. Lori Ann Kemmet is a boulder dentist, and a founder and owner of Incredible Smiles.  \n\nShe says,\n\n\"Many times when we are doing a consultation in my office, many people don't understand the difference between a crown or a cap, and a veneer.  The difference between a crown and a veneer is the amount of natural tooth structure we can save.\n\nThe following explains between a crown VS veneer.\n\nI love saving natural tooth structure, and that's when I love doing a veneer.  A veneer is just an artificial covering over your tooth front.  With a veneer we are able to leave the remaining back tooth structure of your tooth.  So really it's an artificial front and leaving the natural tooth structure on the back.\n\nA crown goes like a cap all the way down to the gum tissue over the tooth.  The downside to getting a crown done is that we are not leaving as much natural tooth structure as we do with a veneer.  A veneer is much more conservative and any time we can do a veneer instead it is better.\n\nSo that's the difference between a veneer and a crown, and to discover more about a crown VS a veneer, visit our website listed at the top of this description.
