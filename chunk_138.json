Typically, if patients seek care in this order, they can usually avoid a lifetime of drugs and unnecessary surgery.\" Written for the layperson, MANIPULATION Under ANESTHESIA introduces MUA as an alternative safe, non-surgical, non-invasive, and highly effective procedure that has been utilized for almost a century with considerable success. It involves placing the patient under a mild anesthesia while the professional team, usually an osteopath and a chiropractic physician, adjusts and stretches the patient's spine and other extremities, such as ankles, shoulders, arms, legs, knees, elbows, pelvis, and/or hips. Much of the success of MUA lies in the fact that the greater extent of manipulation dissolves scar tissues inside the joints and muscles, as well as any fibrous adhesions that have formed due to injury or micro-trauma. When combined with simple follow-up therapies, this procedure not only eliminates pain but also restores or vastly improves the patient's range of motion. It also benefits those who suffer from a range of conditions from fibromyalgia, sciatica, and radiculitis to joint calcification, torticollis, and curvature of the spine. West Palm Beach Chiropractor, Dr. Sabrina Morgen has performed thousands of MUA's in various outpatient ambulatory surgery centers in Palm Beach, Broward, and Indian River Counties. Her easy-to-read guide defines typical candidates for this procedure, outlines the many benefits, and provides a comprehensive list of case studies and evidence based research.

Those who pay close attention to the original album version will hear a bit of Depeche Mode and some Moog sweeps that might as well have been played by French Moog pioneer Jean Jacques Perrey. The subtly playing theme is supported by magnificent synths with an almost tornado style, swirling sound. The changes between the verses and chorus are underlined by a banging snare drum, which is perfect for the people on the dance floor.\n\nFor the remix, the assignment went to the legendary German DJ/Producer Moguai. The man behind super hits like \"Kick Out The Jams\", \"U Know Y\" and \"Beatbox\" already made well known remixes of X-Press2's \"Lazy\", Roman Fl\u00fcgel's \"Geht\u00b4s Noch\" and many others.  Moguai turned the original version into a big, hammering club slammer that will create an immensely enticing atmosphere in every club and venue. The edit style percussive sound effects that Moguai uses really lift the beats up a notch and especially after the towering break, everyone is ready to tear the roof off and throw their hands in the air. Moonbeam's \"Song For A Girl\", in both the original and remix version is an absolute electronic dance hit for every self respecting DJ!\n\nMore Info:\nwww.myspace.com/moonbeamru\nwww.myspace.com/blackfeelwitemusic\n\nSupported by:\nMarkus Schulz, Bobina, Pedro Del Mar, Above & Beyond, Ronski Speed, Andrea Mazza (m2o Radio), Marc Zims, Paul Mendez, PrinsJan (Radio 538), Julius Beat, Gareth Emery, Mark Eteson, Dazzle, Dennis Verheugd (Radio 538), M.I.K.E., Nils Brokerhof, Giuseppe Ottaviani, Michael Paterson, Steve Anderson, Eddie Halliwell, Lange, DJ Sasj, Tjerk Coers (Fresh FM), Dash Berlin, Sied van Riel, Solarstone, Ashley Wallbridge, Sander van Doorn, Riley & Durrant, Matt Cerf, Beltek, Bart Claessen, Mat Zo, Tom Cloud, Danjo and Matt Darey.\n\nYou can buy/download this release over here:\nBeatport: https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/271247/Song%20For%20A%20Girl\nTrackitdown: http://www.trackitdown.net/genre/trance/track/2529800.html\nAudiojelly: http://www.audiojelly.com/singles/465003\nJuno Download:\niTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/song-for-a-girl-ep/id386764116", "title": "Moonbeam featuring Blackfeel Wite - Song for a Girl (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2010-08-16T10:38:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7grj09XePEE", "description": "The swell that rocked the Durban (South Africa) beachfront.", "title": "Durban Swell Damage", "publishedDate": "2007-09-18T13:29:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7grwl48WtJE", "description": "Illuminate your patio to make outdoor entertaining more inviting.

Opinions differ as to whether the birds treated under the scientific name H. himantopus ought to be treated as a single species and if not, how many species to recognize. The scientific name Himantopus comes from the Greek meaning \"strap foot\" or \"thong foot\". Most sources today accept 2--4 species.\n\nAdults are 33--36 cm long. They have long pink legs, a long thin black bill and are blackish above and white below, with a white head and neck with a varying amount of black. Males have a black back, often with greenish gloss. Females' backs have a brown hue, contrasting with the black remiges. In the populations that have the top of the head normally white at least in winter, females tend to have less black on head and neck all year round, while males often have much black, particularly in summer. This difference is not clear-cut, however, and males usually get all-white heads in winter.\n\nImmature birds are grey instead of black and have a markedly sandy hue on the wings, with light feather fringes appearing as a whitish line in flight.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Every temple has a dark room, the North wall of which is entirely covered with a sheet of mixed metals, chiefly copper, very highly polished, with the surface capable of reflecting in it things as well as being a mirror.\"\n\n\"The chela sits on an insulated stool, a three legged bench, placed in a flat bottomed vessel of thick glass [with] the Lama operator likewise, the two forming with the mirror wall a triangle. \"\n\n\"A magnet with the North pole up is suspended over the crown of the chela's head without touching it. The operator having started the thing going leaves the chela alone gazing on the wall, and after the third time [the guiding Lama] is no longer required.\" \n\nThis passage from the \"Mahatma Letters\" would later find it's way to Dr. Elmer Green  a researcher who had become famous in the area of biofeedback and  the \"image making faculty\"that all humans posses. Dr. Green would  experiment with the mirror technology  and modify it into  a copper walled room as described by Ingo Swann in his book \"PSYCHIC SEXUALITY; The Bio-Pyschic  \"Anatomy\" of Sexual Energies. \n\nThe version seen in this video has  followed Dr. Greens design albeit on a much smaller scale by utilizing four copper walls instead of one. But unlike Dr. Green's copper wall environment, this version uses faster than light-speed Tachyon antennas and also Sacred Geometry (not shown) to greatly enhance, with grace and ease, the healing and supercharging effects on the subtle energy bodies.\n\n Because the Tachyon antennas are drawing in faster than light-speed tachyon energy from the zero-point field beyond space-time,  the entire frequency range comprising your energy field experiences releases of energy that may be blocking the free flow of universal energy throughout your entire system. \n\nIf you live in the Tampa Bay area and would like to book a session in the \"Mahatma's Mirror Meditation Chamber\" or if you have any questions you can message us here or call 1-813-300-8657.

Beloved for her trend-setting fashion designs as well as her political activism, Georgiana's fire and wit make her a beloved figure everywhere but her own home, where her cold and distant husband's control over her is stifling, soon sending her into the arms of a another man -- an act that soon forces her to learn about the brutal difference in the rights afforded to 18th century men and women.\n\n\"the duchess\",\"the duchess clip\",\"the duchess part 1\",\"the duchess trailer\",\"keira knightley\",\"laura stevely\",\"saul dibb\",\"wine glass videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"united kingdom\",\"david m thompson\",\"cameron mccracken\",\"christine langan\",\"colleen woodcock\",\"jill tandy\",\"carolyn marks blackwood\",\"gabrielle tana\",\"alexandra arlango\",\"andrew semans\",\"embarrassment videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++374434,/m/01l2fn", "title": "The Duchess (4/9) Movie CLIP - Close Your Eyes (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T18:24:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "7h1MEQiAN8A", "description": "Cheng Shuang tries to attract his buddies' attention by hanging himself on the henroost head down.

Some of the carts are piled high with fruits of all kinds, and it is interesting and amusing to see the expressions of combined fear and anxiety on the faces of the men as they hurry away; the fear of being arrested if they stand, and of losing some of their wares if the carts strike an obstruction in the street.\n\nThe United States in 1903: \nJanuary 2nd President Theodore Roosevelt shuts down post office in Indianola Miss., for refusing to accept its appointed postmistress because she was black / Jan. 9th Two New Yorkers buy the Baltimore baseball franchise for $18,000 and moved it to NY / Aug. 1st, first coast-to-coast automobile trip (SF-NY) completed / Aug. 17th, Joseph Pulitzer donates $1 million to Columbia University and begins Pulitzer Prizes / Dec. 1st, Edwin S.

The research project, called Steeper, aims to increase the energy efficiency of these devices, when active, by 10 times and virtually eliminate power consumption when they are in passive or standby mode.\n\nCoordinated by Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Project Steeper includes leading corporate research organizations IBM Research - Zurich, Infineon and Global Foundries, large research institutes CEA-LETI and Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, academic partners, University of Bologna, University of Dortmund, University of Udine and the University of Pisa and the managerial support of SCIPROM.\n\nScientists collaborating on the project will apply their expertise and research to tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs) and semiconducting nanowires to improve the efficient use of energy in electronics.  To explain the challenge, consider a leaky water faucet -- even after closing the valve as far as possible water continues to drip -- this is similar to today's transistor, in that energy is constantly \"leaking\" or being lost or wasted in the off-state.  In Steeper, scientists not only hope to contain the leak by using a new method to close the valve or gate of the transistor more tightly, but also open and close the gate for maximum current flow with less turns, i.e. less voltage for maximum efficiency.", "title": "European Union Research Initiative Aims to Increase \u2028Electronic Device Efficiency by 10x", "publishedDate": "2010-10-26T09:56:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7h9cUhiTRjs", "description": "", "title": "Nasyid ILP Kangar 1/2009 - Man Team ( Suara Muazzin) In Training 20/3/2009", "publishedDate": "2009-03-14T03:30:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7hB2Bym51hw", "description": "We introduce lauren to bob the protoplasm and discuss his lesser characteristics", "title": "Lauren Meets Bob", "publishedDate": "2007-09-15T19:25:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "7hBDgwAWq54", "description": "Dr. Cliff Ruddle discusses proper endodontic diagnosis. \"There is a significant number of diseased teeth that need endodontics, and they are not be identified.\"", "title": "Dr. Ruddle on Endodontic Diagnosis", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T19:44:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7hC1NA681W0", "description": "The 20 Practical AR Cartridge is a .223 Rem necked down to 20 cal.

Starting off, we head to Brooklyn, where Codes transforms Happy Colors & G-Buck's 'Worldwide' into a bassline stomper sure to impact set lists worldwide. Ookay's 'Once Again' was a massive hit for us, and showed his diverse styles to get acclaim, so we asked Main Course alumnus Skitzofrenix & Jeff Doubleu to take a stab at it, and the results are 'Evvy! Gnarled bass with attacking drums, these guys did it proper, once again. Jesse Slayter caused a tsunami of ass shakes when we dropped 'Thick' back in April, and 2 top notch remixes came in, resulting in aftershock. Foxsky brings his signature style horns and rolling percussion, delivering an instantly infectious midtempo flip. Happy Colors & G-Buck give us more of what made Worldwide so damn catchy -- Tribal rhythms, tight chops = Instant Party! \n Heading down under, rising Sydney based duo Go Freek chop and freak and sprinkle some wonked out bass all over Astronomar's ode to the jiggly puff 'Kirby's Argument'. This one's ready for prime time, use wisely! Aquadrop's Milf Weed also receives the dual remix treatment, as Philadelphian bass maestro Dev79 adds some kick and head nod appeal for all the Milfs with tha big booties. SPF666's Hard Club Dub is just that, a strong riddim tool with slapping drums and great ride. Finally, we end this collection of remixes with His Majesty Andre's 'Dumb' remix of Banana Seat's 'Buddy'. We're not so sure why he's so hard on the mix, as he breaks down the original and builds it back into a scream driven rollercoaster ride for the club. \n\nCover Artwork by Giak\n\nFor Licensing or press enquiries:\ninfo@maincourse.me", "title": "Jesse Slayter - Thick (Happy Colors & G-Buck Remix)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T19:08:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "7hKhjvhHMqM", "description": "BEDUIN DANCE DABKA\nBiblicalProductions.com", "title": "BEDUIN DANCE DABKA.

Varios medicamentos se usan para bajar el nivel plasm\u00e1tico de colesterol. medicamentos para bajar el colesterol Drogas b\u00e1sicamente bajan el nivel de lipoprote\u00edna de baja densidad (LDL) porque LDL elevado est\u00e1 asociado con la aterosclerosis. Por otro lado, la lipoprote\u00edna de alta densidad (HDL) se incrementa debido a que protege contra la aterosclerosis.\n\nAlgunos defectos en el metabolismo del colesterol conduce a un n\u00famero de enfermedades en las que los niveles de colesterol son altos. Tales grupos de enfermedades se conocen como hiperlipoproteinemias primarias. Colesterol que baja las drogas se utilizan para tratar estas condiciones.\n\nElevado nivel de colesterol es un factor de riesgo para la enfermedad cardiovascular. La decisi\u00f3n de prescribir medicamentos depende no s\u00f3lo del nivel de colesterol LDL, sino tambi\u00e9n en la enfermedad coronaria asociada (CAD) los factores de riesgo como la diabetes mellitus, la hipertensi\u00f3n, la obesidad, etc Todos los temas deben tener la terapia con medicamentos si el nivel de colesterol LDL es m\u00e1s de 190 mg / dl.

Ellos inhiben la HMG-COA reductasa, que es una enzima importante en el metabolismo del colesterol. Las dosis terap\u00e9uticas reducen la s\u00edntesis de colesterol en un 20-50%. Las estatinas com\u00fanmente utilizados son lovastatina, atorvastatina, pravastatina, fluvastatina, simvastatina. Diferentes estatinas difieren en su potencia y eficacia m\u00e1xima en la reducci\u00f3n de colesterol LDL.

Y puede aumentar de 2 a 3 litros en caso de retenci\u00f3n aguda de orina. Esta capacidad se reduce en casos de cistitis hasta los 50 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos.\n\nEl interior de la vejiga se visualiza realizando una cistoscopia, que observa la mucosa vesical, los meatos ureterales y el cuello vesical (la uni\u00f3n con la uretra). Estos tres puntos delimitan el tr\u00edgono vesical, que es una porci\u00f3n fija y no distensible del \u00f3rgano.\nLa cistitis es la inflamaci\u00f3n aguda o cr\u00f3nica de la vejiga urinaria, con infecci\u00f3n o sin ella.Puede tener distintas causas. La causa m\u00e1s frecuente de cistitis es la infecci\u00f3n por bacterias gram negativas, destacando entre todas la Escherichia coli. Para que una bacteria produzca cistitis primero debe colonizar la orina de la vejiga (bacteriuria) y posteriormente producir una respuesta inflamatoria en la mucosa vesical. A esta forma de cistitis se le denomina cistitis bacteriana aguda. Afecta a personas de todas las edades, aunque sobre todo a mujeres en edad f\u00e9rtil o a ancianos de ambos sexos. \n\nIn anatomy, the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination. A hollow[1] muscular, and distensible (or elastic) organ, the bladder sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra.Cystitis is a term that refers to urinary bladder inflammation that results from any one of a number of distinct syndromes . It is most commonly caused by a bacterial infection in which case it is referred to as a urinary tract infection.\nSigns and symptoms\nPressure in the lower pelvis\nPainful urination (dysuria)\nFrequent urination (polyuria) or urgent need to urinate (urinary urgency)\nNeed to urinate at night (nocturia, similar to prostate cancer or BPH)\nAbnormal urine color (cloudy), similar to a urinary tract infection\nFoul or strong urine odour", "title": "Examen de la vejiga urinaria, cistitis - Urinary bladder palpation,Cystitis", "publishedDate": "2010-09-02T18:48:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7iMMxE5tStA", "description": "NE Brazil Birding - NOV 2012 Tour - Chapada do Araripe - state of Cear\u00e1 - North-east Brazil", "title": "Araripe Manakin - Soldadinho-do-araripe - Antikophia bokermanni", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T03:06:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7iMSmqQESsw", "description": "What's your number one CR7 moment?

Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite also follow the practice of blessing and distributing antidoron.\n\nn the Orthodox Church, blessed antidoron is distributed after every Divine Liturgy. During the Prothesis (Liturgy of Preparation, at which the wine and bread are prepared on the Table of Oblation), the priest will bless each prosphoron as he takes it up to remove particles and place them on the diskos (paten). The remainder of the prosphora is cut into fragments and kept aside in a bowl or salver. In some jurisdictions it is the custom at the end of the Anaphora for the altar server to hand the bowl of antidoron to the priest who will make the Sign of the Cross with it over the chalice and diskos during the hymn, It is Truly Meet.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Liturgy, the antidoron is distributed to the faithful as thy come up to kiss the blessing cross.

Common names include Strelitzia, Crane Flower or Bird of Paradise, though these names are also collectively applied to other species in the genus Strelitzia. Its scientific name commemorates Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen consort of the United Kingdom, wife of H.R.H. King George III. The species is native to South Africa but naturalized in Mexico, Bangladesh, Madeira Islands and Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands off the coast of Chile.\n\nThe plant grows to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, with large, strong leaves 25--70 cm (9.8--27.6 in) long and 10--30 cm (3.9--11.8 in) broad, produced on petioles up to 1 m (39 in) long. The leaves are evergreen and arranged in two ranks, making a fan-shaped crown. The flowers stand above the foliage at the tips of long stalks. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges is termed the spathe. This is placed perpendicular to the stem, which gives it the appearance of a bird's head and beak; it makes a durable perch for holding the sunbirds which pollinate the flowers. The flowers, which emerge one at a time from the spathe, consist of three brilliant orange sepals and three purplish-blue petals. Two of the blue petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the sunbirds sit to drink the nectar, the petals open to cover their feet in pollen", "title": "STRELITZIA REGINAE FLOWER PLANT", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T13:21:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7iovf94e4uU", "description": "Learn Arabic Lebanese through these easy lessons.

Their teachers weren't trying to convert them. This wasn't some secret conspiracy. \n\nThey were just being taught what Muslims believe. Basic things. The Five Pillars of Islam. Who was Muhammad? Things like that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of that. In fact, it'd be silly not to learn about that stuff because of how much effect those beliefs have had on various parts of the world. \n\nI mean, it's hard to understand current events if you don't know a few basic things about what motivates devout Muslims, just as it's hard to understand U.S politics if you don't know anything about evangelical Christianity.\n\nSo the schools did nothing wrong. They were teaching kids about the major world religions, they were on the units covering Islam, and all hell broke loose with these parents.\n\nIn one case, in Massachusetts, the dad said it was insulting that his son was learning this material because they believe in Jesus.\n\nWho knew being a Christian was a Get Out of Jail Free card for getting smarter? I don't have to learn anything I don't already believe! My education stops here. \n\nWhat's the dad gonna complain about next? While we're at it, why are we learning about other countries? We're Americans, dammit!\n\nIt's worth pointing out that even halfway-decent private Christian schools teach students about the beliefs of Islam.\n\nIn another case, in Maryland, the dad was so furious, he said he would \"bring down a shitstorm on the school.\" So they had to issue a no-trespassing order against the guy, because that could be a threat.\n\nI feel awful for these kids, though. I don't know if they feel the same way their parents do, but it's irresponsible for these parents to force their kids to be as ignorant as they are.\n\nIt's the same worry I have when parents freak out because their kids are reading a book in English class that might contain some mature topics and language. They demand an alternative assignment... because their kids must never be exposed to books that make them think. The Bible's fine, though.\n\nI'm afraid of asking what happens when these students have to take a science class and learn about evolution, or a health class where they learn about birth control and condoms.\n\nI just hope they're able to learn about these topics in spite of their parents. Because they're missing out on some really important information. \n\nIf only the parents could sit in on those same classes, maybe they'd learn something, too.\n\n\nYou Might Also Like ...\n\n\n\n7 Things That Prove God is Real\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ50omyWziE&list=PLZGLqPtxUOKEZxzukuev1YpLUQp-CtKDq&index=128\n\n\n\n78 Questions for Christians\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI-_FJuTPns&index=138&list=PLZGLqPtxUOKEZxzukuev1YpLUQp-CtKDq\n\n\n4 Creative Ways to Deal with Preachers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3kHcV36dak&index=133&list=PLZGLqPtxUOKEZxzukuev1YpLUQp-CtKDq\n\n\n\nJoin the conversation.

As you will see in this video, it is not very difficult to find drop shipping wholesalers on the Internet that will help you create a successful drop shipping business. In fact, I have something that is even more beneficial then drop shipping wholesalers are. What I have is a program called DS domination. DS domination is an amazing drop shipping course that is built into an affiliate platform. So not only can you skip over the issue of finding a drop shipping wholesaler, but it also allows you to learn how you can successfully drop ship from just utilizing Amazon and eBay. The idea of the program is to teach you how to basically play the middleman and take orders from one site only to have the other side deliver their product straight to the customer. In each transaction you keep the difference and that profit will soon add up. In fact a lot of people on my personal DS domination team are replacing their incomes after their first 60 days of getting in this program. It is pretty much a copy and paste type system that teaches you step-by-step how you can be successful in drop shipping whether you can locate drop shipping wholesalers on your own or not. So if you are interested in more information on drop shipping wholesalers and a program that was literally help you create another stream of income then click on the link under the video located above this description and get started.\n\nDrop shipping wholesalers, wholesale, dropshipping Suppliers, eBay suppliers, Amazon, wholesale dropshippers, salehoo, designer handbags, review, drop shipping companies, drop shipping wholesalers clothing, drop shipping wholesalers shoes, drop shipping for dummies, drop shipping wholesalers review, drop shipping ebay, doba reviews, free drop shipping wholesalers\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/7jCg8qU78B4", "title": "Drop Shipping Wholesalers -- The King of All Drop Shipping Wholesalers!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T19:19:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jCoRPHlVuI", "description": "Subscribe to Button!

The baby animals - three lions cubs, a tiger cub, and a spotted hyena cub are having a roaring good time at the Akwaaba Lodge in Rustenburg, South Africa, where all the baby animals live under one roof. \n\nThe owner of the four- star hotel, Layla Cajee, has raised the lion cubs, tiger cub and hyena cub from birth. Bella the baby tiger, five months, is the leader of the pack, while the three baby lions, Delano, Romeo and Maximus, also five months, prefer a paws and a nap. Meanwhile the eldest  baby animal - Milika the hyena, six months - is the most mischievous in the motley crew of animal babies. The animals share the same living enclosures and even share meal times together. But these cute cuddly animals will transform into predators in two year's time - so the baby tiger cub, the baby lion cubs and the baby hyena cub will be split up and live in separate enclosures.\n\nDirector / Videographer - Ruaridh Connellan\nProducer - James Tegerdine\nEditors: Joshua Douglas / Ian Phillips\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the Barcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp\nLike Barcroft Media on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/RJlaj6\nFollow Barcroft Media on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9", "title": "Baby Animals: Baby Lion, Baby Tiger  & Baby Hyena Cub Animal Cuteness!", "publishedDate": "2013-04-25T13:46:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jZDCUaiTlQ", "description": "Info:\nhttp://thoushaltnot.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttp://www.thoushalt.net/\n\nhttp://www.projekt.com/product.asp?sku=PRO00260\n\nNote:\nI don\u00b4t upload this videos to harm anyone; if there are problems with the copyright or you don\u00b4t want your music or picture here, please contact me and I will delete it.", "title": "ThouShaltNot - The Haunted Phonograph", "publishedDate": "2011-09-08T22:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jZTZ1KMYw8", "description": "My question is where do they really think theyre going on that magical wheel ?

Specifically, we study an architecture called the \"Wireless Control Network\" (WCN), where each wireless node maintains a state, and periodically updates it as a linear combination of neighboring plant outputs and node states. This architecture has previously been shown to have low computational overhead and beneficial scheduling and compositionality properties. In this paper we characterize fundamental topological conditions to allow stabilization using such a scheme. To achieve this, we exploit the fact that the WCN scheme causes the network to act as a linear dynamical system, and analyze the coupling between the plant's dynamics and the dynamics of the network. We show that stabilizing control inputs can be computed in-network if the vertex connectivity of the network is larger than the geometric multiplicity of any unstable eigenvalue of the plant. This condition is analogous to the typical min-cut condition required in classical information dissemination problems.

The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1969 B. J. Thomas song \"Hooked on a Feeling\". Released that same year on their album Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede's version was adapted from British pop eccentric Jonathan King, using his ooga-chaka ooga-chaka background on a version he had earlier recorded of the same song.[citation needed] \"Hooked on a Feeling\" was released in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974, and reached #1 for one week in the U.S. staying in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks.[1] The R.I.A.A. granted gold disc status on 28 March 1974.[1] The track also topped charts in Canada, Australia and the Netherlands.[1]\n\nThe group had a U.S. Top 10 hit with a cover of The Association's \"Never My Love\". Also of note, the group recorded a medley that combined \"Hush\" by Deep Purple and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies' song of the same name), and which achieved its greatest success in Scandinavia.", "title": "Blue Swede - Destiny - 1974 (Studio Version)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T02:01:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jxt_x71h60", "description": "2nd alt quality 16 then regal + 7 items -- Watch live at http://www.twitch.tv/kapiko1", "title": "PoE - Gemscutter strongbox alternation orb + regal", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T02:19:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jy4fu13-kI", "description": "Alice in Wonderland u l-Gimmick tal-Millenju", "title": "Alice in Wonderland u l-Gimmick tal-Millenju", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T20:09:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7jyLaoRfdrM", "description": "ISRC: HUA631400077 (Minden jog fenntartva! -- All Rights Reserved!)\n\nFejjel lefel\u00e9 CD -- EDGECD190\n2014 EDGE Records (HMR Music Kft.)\n\nDOROTHY:\nDodo - \u00e9nek/basszusgit\u00e1r\nBrigi - git\u00e1r\nKlo - dob\n\nfeat.

Frequently more than one lender will make a loan to someone secured by their home, their car, their business assets or their other property. Once a lender records a notice of their lien with a state or county recording office, other lenders will know of that lien's existence and decide whether or not to make a loan.

Somebody asked me if the game is good, this was my reply more-or-less:\nI just got done playing through for the second time. each playthrough is a different experience. while the \"maps\" remain the same, the details like cave drawings, clues, etc. change each time. you also get a new narrative each time as well. this allows one's analysis of the mysterious and open-to-interpretation story to change each time as well. these subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle alterations allowed me to get almost a whole new perspective on the world the game throws you into. the level of detail put into this game can be compared to bioshock, where new details can be picked up on even the 3rd or 4th time you play it... just an amazing game!!!

A member of the rodent family, marmots are active creatures and can be seen mostly in the alpine and sub-alpine mountain slopes where they build dens in the rocks.  Marmots are social animals and can be seen living in small communities near their dens.  They can also be found in the flower fields eating the lush meadow vegetation.  Marmots need to store fat and energy for the long hibernation during the winter months.\n\nAvailable on location and from www.finleyholiday.com", "title": "Hoary Marmot eating plants in Mount Rainier National Park", "publishedDate": "2009-03-06T20:22:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7kH61aqsPSE", "description": "Zodiark, Keeper of Precepts (Master of all Commandment Zodiac), da most powerful summon in FFXII, element Darkness n representant of da ancient zodiac sign Ophiucus/Serpentarius.

O que ocorreu* Os porcos ficaram magros! Por isso o \u00f3rg\u00e3o sugeriu alimentar com soja e milho. Para alegria dos cuidadores de porcos, os mesmos come\u00e7aram a engordar.\nTempos depois uma s\u00e9rie de fatores incentivou o desuso do \u00f3leo de coco, como artigos cient\u00edficos que identificaram as gorduras saturadas como um agente causador de doen\u00e7as cardiovasculares (o \u00f3leo de coco \u00e9 uma gordura saturada). M\u00e9dicos e nutricionistas aboliram o ovo, as carnes e os \u00f3leos com gordura saturada da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o das pessoas, incentivando-as a utilizarem \u00f3leos polinsaturados como o de soja, algod\u00e3o, milho, canola, etc. Houve um impacto comercial e estas gorduras quase desapareceram do mercado. Explodiu o consumo de \u00f3leos vegetais refinados. Todavia, h\u00e1 menos de 10 anos, constatou-se que 75% das gorduras que obstruem as art\u00e9rias, s\u00e3o provenientes das gorduras vegetais polinsaturadas e, n\u00e3o das gorduras saturadas. \nO \u00f3leo de coco \u00e9 um produto natural extra\u00eddo do leite de coco (Cocos nuc\u00edfera) prensado a frio.

This book, published by the British Museum, shows the progression of bookplates through the ages. \n\nThe first bookplates featured coats of arms of the aristocracy -- the only people wealthy enough to have a library. By the 19th century, books were more common and bookplates became artistic statements. Talented illustrators -- such as Albrecht Durer, Edward Burne-Jones, Aubrey Beardsley, Charles Voysey, Frank Brangwyn, Walter Crane and Eric Gill -- designed bookplates.\n\nBookplates often reflected the owner's interests and many artistic styles can be seen from the Arts and Crafts to the modernist movement. Etchings, woodcuts, pen and ink drawings, linocuts and lithographs have all been used.\n\nLearn more at the AbeBooks' Book Collecting Guide: http://bit.ly/ujYGTh\n\nFind copies of Ex Libris by Martin Hopkinson at AbeBooks: http://bit.ly/vCqucE", "title": "AbeBooks: Beautiful Bookplates", "publishedDate": "2011-12-02T22:32:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7khSd_p1rh8", "description": "clip from the 1970 film \"The Man Who Had Power Over Women\" Peter Reaney (Rod Taylor) is the successful talent agent who enjoys the things that money can buy.
