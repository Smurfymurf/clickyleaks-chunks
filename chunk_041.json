[{"_id": "1XDdtZ_6FFI", "description": "What is KINESTHESIA?\nKINESTHESIA started as a Hyper Island student project. It is an interactive audio-visual experiment developed for the exhibition Fluorescent Space Vibration in October 2014. \n\nThe word \"kinesthesia\" refers to the perception of movements of one's body; it's relationship to, not only it's limbs and muscles, but also the space and objects around it. We wanted to explore that sense of bodily movement and connect it to the senses of seeing and hearing, creating an experience where you not only can hear music but also feel it, almost touch it. \n\nHow does it work?\nKinesthesia uses the Microsoft Kinect to track the users movements, translating the position of hands and arms into data for Ableton Live. Each possible movement is mapped to a certain button, slider or knob in an array of effects making the slightest movement instantaneously recognizable and creating a sense of real control of the senses.\n\nMusic by The Acid, Creeper (all rights reserved)", "title": "Kinesthesia", "publishedDate": "2014-10-19T13:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XECHSQfBCc", "description": "1 \u0422\u0443\u0440 \u041a\u041f\u041b \n\u0418\u0440\u0442\u044b\u0448 - \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0435\u0440 \n\u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0440-\u041b\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u00ab\u0418\u0440\u0442\u044b\u0448\u00bb \u2014 \u00ab\u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0435\u0440\u00bb 1:0\n\n\u00ab\u0418\u0440\u0442\u044b\u0448\u00bb \u2014 \u00ab\u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0451\u0440\u00bb 1:0 (1:0)\n\u0413\u043e\u043b: \u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e 32 (1:0)\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432 27, \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432 28, \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 76, \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 82 \u2014 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0432 86\n\u00ab\u0418\u0440\u0442\u044b\u0448\u00bb: 1. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0434\u0436\u043e, 3. \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043e\u0432, 5. \u0413\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430, 6. \u0427\u0438\u0447\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d, 8. \u0410\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (13. \u0410\u044f\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 70), 10. \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0432 (\u043a), 15. \u0425\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0443\u043d, 19.\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, 23.\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432, 30. \u0414\u0443\u0434\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (98. \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 46), 77. \u041c\u0443\u0445\u0443\u0442\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 (11. \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 61)\n\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0432: 33. \u041a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u044f\u0440, 2. \u041a\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0432, 9. \u0411\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d, 25. \u0427\u0443\u0447\u043c\u0430\u043d\n\u00ab\u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0451\u0440\u00bb: 35. \u041c\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043d, 3. \u0412\u0438\u0447\u044e\u0441, 4. \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, 6. \u0424\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0441 (7. \u0411\u0430\u0439\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 28), 14. \u0424\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e (\u043a), 17. \u041f\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0432, 25. \u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0439, 27. \u041c\u0443\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432 (9. \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0447 77), 29. \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432 (10. \u041a\u043e\u043d\u044b\u0441\u0431\u0430\u0435\u0432 85), 77. \u041b\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043d, 87. \u0421\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\n\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0432: 1. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432, 19. \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, 21. \u0416\u0430\u043d\u0433\u044b\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0431\u0430\u0439, 22. \u0413\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432\n\u0421\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0438: \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u041a\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0410\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 (\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u2014 \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430)\nhttp://vk.com/fc_shakhter_karaganda \u0412\u041a", "title": "\u041e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u0418\u0440\u0442\u044b\u0448 1 0 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0435\u0440   15 3 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-17T16:51:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XEExWGHwXs", "description": "1st Full Album\u300eCICADA\u300f2013.10.02 Available!!\nMXMM-10029 \uffe52,690(tax in)\nincluding 14 tracks\n\n01.

The game was released by Bandai Namco for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles on October 25, 2011, in North America, on October 28, 2011, in European countries, and on December 8, 2011, in Japan. It was re-released in Japan on the Sony PlayStation 3's The Best line on February 21, 2013. \n\nThe Story Mode begins with a battle between Bardock and Frieza, then the battle against Raditz and ends with the final fight between Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta and Omega Shenron. During Free Roam (if playing as Goku), Goku can ride the Nimbus Cloud or have another character such as Piccolo follow Goku. There are also Chase Sequences found in such instances as a battle between Vegeta and Zarbon. This includes a chase where the controlled character must escape Zarbon without getting too close or risk being defeated, as most villains will not hesitate to fire Ki Blasts if the controlled character fall behind.\n\nAfter finishing the battle between Bardock and Frieza, and getting hit by Frieza's Supernova technique, a cutscene ensues showing the destruction of Planet Vegeta and Goku's arrival on Earth. After the cutscene, it shows flashbacks of Goku and Gohan at the Kame House, Goku taking the powerful blow to the stomach by Raditz, as well as Goku atop the Nimbus Cloud flying alongside Piccolo. The Free Roam screen includes a Dragon Radar used for finding such places as the Story Objectives or the World Tournament, however, if visiting the World Tournament during Story Mode, the player will be forced to use the character they are currently playing as in Story Mode. The screen also includes use of capsules, a recharge button and a full screen Dragon Radar. Also, certain characters equipped with scouters may use them as well. This interface is almost no different aside from giving the screen a red tint and including arrows that appear to guide towards the next Story Objective. The player also has the option to locate the Story Objectives or rather, can hide it and attempt to find it on their own: objectives have a large beam of light that shoots up from the ground, making them easy to spot at close range. When the controlled character reach the Story Objectives, a battle usually begins. Fight Sequences are far more accurate than those found the previous installments; for example, rather than having to do a Team Super Attack to kill Raditz with a Special Beam Cannon, Goku automatically holds Raditz while Piccolo launches it and destroys them both. This same effect can be seen when defeating Vegeta (Scouter) and executing the Spirit Bomb (or Fusion Spirit Bomb, as it was called in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2) when used as a Team Super Attack. \n\nAfter a battle, a cutscene will ensue, followed by a narration telling the events that have taken place since that battle has taken place. After this, the controlled character will return to the Free Roam screen and be free to travel to the next Story Objective.

Note that two SHG nanoprobes -- labeled in the initial time-point with white and orange arrows -- move beneath the plane of focus during the time-lapse. Interestingly, several PEG-BT nanoprobes seem to mark cells that are not labeled with Dendra2, because they seem to move at approximately the same rate as other cells in the image while not being inside any of the labeled cells themselves. Note that the varying sizes of the nanoprobes within the video presumably stem from anomalous subdiffusion and molecular crowding within cell compartments (e.g. endocytic compartments).

The only reason to misrepresent the events is to support the coup and to cover up Washington's hand.\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that the coup is a strategic move by Washington to weaken Russia. Washington tried to capture Ukraine in 2004 with the Washington-funded \"Orange Revolution,\" but failed.  Ukraine was part of Russia for 200 years prior to being granted independence in the 1990s. The eastern and southern provinces of Ukraine are Russian areas that were added to Ukraine in the 1950s by the Soviet leadership in order to water down the influence of the nazi elements in the western Ukraine that had fought for Adolf Hitler against the Soviet Union during World War 2.\nThe loss of Ukraine to the EU and NATO would mean the loss of Russia's naval base on the Black Sea and the loss of many military industries.  If Russia were to accept such strategic defeat, it would mean that Russia had submitted to Washington's hegemony.\nWhatever course the Russian government takes, the Russian population of eastern and southern Ukraine will not accept oppression by Ukrainian ultra-nationalists and neo-nazis. The hostility already shown toward the Russian population can be seen in the destruction by Ukrainians of the monument to the Russian troops that drove Hitler's divisions out of Ukraine during World War 2 and the destruction of the monument to Russian General Kutuzov, whose tactics destroyed Napoleon's Grand Army and resulted in the fall of Napoleon.\nThe question at the moment is whether Washington miscalculated and lost control of the coup to the neo-nazi elements who seem to have taken control from the Washington-paid moderates in Kiev, or whether the Washington neocons have been working with the neo-nazis for years.   Max Blumenthal says the latter.\nThe moderates have certainly lost control. They cannot protect public monuments, and they are forced to try to pre-empt the neo-nazis by legislating the neo-nazi program. The captive Ukrainian parliament has introduced measures to ban any official use of the Russian language. This, of course, is unacceptable to the Russian provinces. \"Ukraine parliament\" \"anti-government protesters\" \"Viktor Yanukovich\" clash police \"opposition leader\" \"Ukrainian riot police\" \"city center\" crackdown \"independence square\" kiev \"deadline expired\" gunfire grenades \"open warfare\" bullets \" Interior Ministry \" Russia EU US \"peace talks\" Kyiv Germany \"abc news\" \"cnn news\" \"fox news\" \"nbc news\" \"political news\" \"ap news\" \"bbc news\" \"rt news\" \"barack obama\" As I noted in a previous column, the Ukrainian parliament itself is responsible for the destruction of democracy in Ukraine. Its unconstitutional and undemocratic actions have paved the way for the neo-nazis who now have the precedent to treat the moderates the same way that the moderates treated the elected government and to cover up their illegality with accusations of crimes and arrest warrants. Today the illegally deposed President Yanukovych is on the run.  Tomorrow will the current president, Oleksander Turchinov, put in office by the moderates, not by the people, be on the run?  If a democratic election did not convey legitimacy to President Yanukovych, how does selection by a rump parliament convey legitimacy to Turchinov?\nIf Washington has lost control of the coup and is unable to restore control to the moderates whom it has aligned with the EU and NATO, war would seem to be unavoidable. There is no doubt that the Russian provinces would seek  and be granted Russia's protection. Whether Russia would go further and overthrow the neo-nazis in western Ukraine is unknown.  Whether Washington, which seems to have positioned military forces in the region, would provide the military might for the moderates to defeat the neo-nazis is also an open question, as is Russia's response.", "title": "Ultra Nationalist Uprising in Ukraine - Fear of Masked Men Part of Fascist Group", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T22:59:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XPKOVbSNew", "description": "My cover of \"Doom 64 Theme\" from Doom 64.

Stephanie and Keela are white; Mareshia and Quanesha are black, which means that they would not have been able to attend prom together, they told WSAV\n\n\"We are all friends,\" Stephanie told WSAV. \"That's just kind of not right that we can't go to prom together.\"\n\nThe school holds separate proms for white and non-white students. Homecoming is also normally segregated, with separate courts for each race.\n\nIf a student attempted to cross the segregation divide \"They would probably have the police come out there and escort them off the premises,\" said Keela. \n\nMail Online reports that the school has not broken any civil rights laws because it doesn't actually sponsor the segregated prom dances - or any prom dance, for that matter. Instead, parents and students are responsible for organizing and funding the private events.\n\nThe Wilcox County schools website does not list a prom in its calendar of events, nor is the controversy referenced in their \"School News\" section.\n\nIn the video above, the students report that there has been opposition to their plans. Keela says \"I put up posters for the \"Integrated Prom\" and we've had people ripping them down at the school.\"\n\nQuanesha describes the reactions that she has met with in response to the integrated prom: \"We need to stick with the tradition. This is a traditional thing we don't need to change and stuff like that, but why? No one can answer my question.\"\n\nRochelle City Councilman Wayne McGuinty told Fox 24 that the Wilcox County High School's segregated prom is not an accurate representation of his community.\n\n\"I think it's more of the personal opinions of those involved,\" said McGuinty. \"I don't think there is an effort made to keep black kids out of the white prom and to keep white kids out of the black prom.\"\n\nWSAV reports that there will still be two proms this year. The students said that when they pushed for one prom, the school offered a resolution to permit an integrated prom that would allow all students to attend but not stop segregated proms.\n\n\nDARK MATTER PARADIGM | http://www.darkmatterparadigm.blogspot.com\n\nThe mystery and history of the first peoples - The Indigenous, Original Moors.

Alocasia are distinctly exotic and tropical plants that are increasingly becoming popular as houseplants.They are typically grown as pot plants, but a better way is to grow the plants permanently in the controlled conditions of a greenhouse. They do not do well in the dark and need good lighting if inside the house. \n\nThe large cordate or sagittate leaves grow to a length of 20 to 90 cm on long petioles. Their araceous flowers grow at the end of a short stalk, but are not conspicuous; often hidden behind the leaf petioles. The stem (a corm) is edible, but contains raphid or raphide crystals of Calcium oxalate along with other irritants (possibly a protease) that can numb and swell the tongue and pharynx resulting in difficult breathing, and sharp throat pain. The lower parts contain more of the poison. Prolonged boiling before serving or processing may reduce the risks but acidic fruit such as tamarind may dissolve them.\n\nCheerapunji also called  Sohra, Cherrapunjee and Charrapunji, is a town in East Khasi Hills district in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It is credited as being the wettest place on Earth. However, nearby Mawsynram has more rainfall nowadays, and both are surpassed by Llor\u00f3, Colombia. Today, climatic changes have edged Cherrapunji out of the topmost 'wet' slot, but it still retains its pristine beauty, its unusual facets, the perpetual clouds, and the perpetual mists. Appropriately, Cherrapunji lies in the heart of the State of Meghalaya-the abode of clouds. It is the traditional capital of a hima which is a Khasi tribal chieftainship constituting a petty state known as Sohra or Churra. High above misty valleys and foaming rivers, ensconced in swirling clouds and perched on an escarpment, lies Cherrapunji (4,500 feet). \n\nCherrapunji receives rains from the Bay of Bengal arm of the Indian summer monsoon. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of Bangladesh for about 400 km. Thereafter, they hit the Khasi Hills which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1370 m above mean sea level within 2 to 5 km. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of Cherrapunji's rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall at Cherrapunji is perhaps the best-known feature of orographic rain in northeast India.\n\nThe home of enterprising Khasi clans, Cherrapunji's place in the Guinness Book of Records is not its only claim to fame. Along with falls lesser in height but no less alluring, the spectacular, cascading 1,035-ft-high Mawsmai Falls-the fourth highest in India-lie just a few kilometers beyond Cherrapunji. Close by is situated a fascinating labyrinth of underground passages beneath age-old caves-a veritable dream for amateur explorers. Elsewhere around Cherrapunji, Khasi monoliths (stones in memory of their ancestors) lie dotted around-a vague reminder of the forests of Bastar. Cherrapunji has several comfortable private hotels. Staying at the Circuit House and the Dak Bungalow require prior permission from the administration. Cherrapunji is 58 km from Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya. A steep motorable road, almost perpetually bathed in mist as it climbs upwards on the last lap, leads up to Cherrapunji. Buses and taxis ply to Cherrapunji from Shillong. \n\nSource: wikipedia.org & http://www.tourism-of-india.com\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In this video Dr. Angela Agrios, ND (Naturopathic Doctor) shares how natural medicine treatment can reverse the symptoms of eczema by first understanding the causes of eczema, and then using lifestyle modifications and supplements to effectively treat eczema. For example, food intolerances are a leading cause of the symptoms of eczema and simple blood tests are available which can pinpoint those intolerances. Simply by making some food changes one can help cure their eczema. Certain nutritional factors can help heal eczema, fish oil and evening primrose oil because of the essential fatty acids, Vitamin A, probiotics and zinc. For those who adopt a natural medicine (Naturopathic Medicine) approach to treating their eczema rash, full resolution of the problem can be within a couple of months!

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.\nIndividual Moslems may show splendid qualities \u2014 but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.\"\n\nThe River War, volume II pp. 248-250 (1899)", "title": "Islam, the \"Religion of Peace\": Winston Churchill Said it as it is", "publishedDate": "2009-05-08T14:02:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XlCm9OLWhE", "description": "Scopri tutti i nostri video: http://www.youtube.com/user/uChefpuntoit/videos?view=0\n\nIl Ristorante \"Il Centro\" di Priocca (CN) propone questo ottimo antipasto. \n\nLa Barba dei frati \u00e8 le piantina giovane della Salsola soda e a seconda delle varie regioni dItalia \u00e8 detta anche Barba del Negus , Agretto, Lischi, Roscano, Baciccio, Liscaro, Senape dei monaci.

I bumped into him,\" said Merlino, appearing fit and tan on a return trip to Philadelphia. \"I didn't report it. ... It just slipped my mind.\"\n\nMerlino, 52, has been living in south Florida since 2011, when he left prison after more than a decade from a Philadelphia racketeering conviction. His lawyer maintains that Merlino plans to work as a maitre d' at a new Boca Raton restaurant that will bear his name.\n\n\"His mother helped us out greatly with recipes,\" said Stanley Stein, the elderly businessman funding the restaurant, who said he flew Merlino up for court hearings this month in a private jet and paid for his stay at the Four Seasons hotel.\n\nThe FBI has been tailing Merlino as part of a new, unspecified criminal probe, according to testimony Friday from organized crime task force members. The night of the cigar bar meeting in June, five people in five cars were on the surveillance detail.\n\nTwo FBI task force members - who feared they stood out among regulars as they sipped pricey drinks - said they observed Merlino talking with Ciancaglini and other felons in a glass-enclosed VIP section of a spot called Havana Nights.\n\n\"It's very obvious what is going on. This is a night on the town with his mob buddies,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney David Troyer argued Friday.\n\nDefense lawyer Edwin Jacobs Jr. insists the contact was random and amounted to nothing more than \"a couple of minutes of chit chat.\"\n\nCiancaglini's wife testified that she often visits Merlino in Florida but said her husband steers clear to avoid legal trouble for either of them. Ciancaglini stayed at the hotel when she and Merlino attended the bar mitzvah of Merlino's nephew in Malibu, California, she said.\n\nTroyer also argued that Merlino violated parole when he refused to answer financial questions - instead invoking his Fifth Amendment rights - during an interview with officials.\n\nAlthough Merlino appears to be enjoying an enviable lifestyle, he reported having almost no income.\n\n\"He miraculously survives on a paltry amount of money,\" Troyer said.\n\nDeborah Merlino testified that she has a successful business and has long supported him. She and the couple's younger daughter had just moved to Florida when officials filed the parole violation notice last month, days before Merlino's supervision was to end.", "title": "Reputed Ex-Mob Boss Gets Extra 4 Months In Prison", "publishedDate": "2014-10-25T05:48:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XszExtMeOU", "description": "Paid for by Governor Branstad Committee", "title": "Branstad-Reynolds Vote Early by Absentee", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T02:40:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Xszh9bJViI", "description": "Sam Smith recorded this absolutely amazing version of 'When I Was Your Man' for us, and we thought it was finally time to share it with you!\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToCapitalFM\n\nGet involved with the UK's No. 1 Hit Music Station!\nWebsite: http://www.capitalfm.com/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/CapitalFM\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/CapitalOfficial", "title": "Sam Smith - 'When I Was Your Man' (Bruno Mars Cover) (Capital Live Session)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-17T16:03:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Xt4BD61_QE", "description": "Prom 2014", "title": "Prom 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T01:12:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XtMS7w_P4s", "description": "Pied kingfisher on Chao Phraya river in Ayudhya, Thailand", "title": "Pied Kingfisher", "publishedDate": "2014-02-09T09:37:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XtXGVcEnVA", "description": "Pesto Panini Recipe (Quick and Easy Sandwich)\nSubscribe 4 Food- \u202ahttp://www.youtube.com/benjimantv\nFollow my Instagram- http://www.instagram.com/BenjiManFOOD\n\nxo Tongs: http://amzn.to/1vFQrbV\n\nCONNECT WITH ME\nINSTAGRAM- http://instagram.com/benjimanfood\nFACEBOOK- https://www.facebook.com/BenjiManTVt\nTWITTER- twitter.com/benjimantv\n\nWatch Our Other Channels\nDAILY VLOG- https://www.youtube.com/user/itsJudysLife\nITSJUDYTIME- https://www.youtube.com/user/itsjudytime\n\nBusiness Inquiries: ijtbusiness@gmail.com\n\n\nI love food, life, and everything about people!!!

La demencia que las potencias enemigas desataron sobre la Humanidad ya ha pasado su punto culminante en lo que a esta guerra se refiere. Lo \u00fanico que dejara detr\u00e1s de si, y en todo el mundo, ser\u00e1 solamente un indescriptible sentimiento de verg\u00fcenza y de asco. Y no puede ser de otro modo. La artificialmente construida y corrompidamente mantenida coalici\u00f3n entre plutocracia y bolcheviquismo terminara por romperse.\" \n\n\n\"Alemania terminara dividida. Austria terminara librada a su propio destino. Los soviets extender\u00e1n su influencia hasta el Atl\u00e1ntico. Inglaterra tarde o temprano perder\u00e1 la totalidad de su Imperio. Hasta Estados Unidos pronto pensara distinto sobre este estremecedor fen\u00f3meno mundial. Guerras raciales internas y una decadencia indetenible les har\u00e1 perder su prestigio y poder mundial.\" \n\n\n\"Suceda lo que suceda, Alemania renacer\u00e1 en pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de esta guerra. Y no ser\u00e1 solo por su propio esfuerzo. Alemania es tan imprescindible para Europa que hasta nuestros propios actuales enemigos tendr\u00e1n que impulsar su reconstrucci\u00f3n. Nuestros campos y provincias destruidas ser\u00e1n repobladas en nuevas ciudades y pueblos...volveremos a ser amigos de todos los pueblos de buena voluntad que habitan la tierra y junto con ellos haremos cicatrizar las heridas que deforman el noble rostro de nuestro continente.\" \n\n\n\"Toda europa y el mundo participara de los avances que le hemos dado a la Ciencia. Pero la pregunta decisiva es de si en este mundo mas nuevo y brillante vivir\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n personas mas felices. Si nuestros enemigos imponen su voluntad, la humanidad naufragara en un mar de sangre y de lagrimas. Habr\u00e1 guerras y mas guerras que se suceder\u00e1n pr\u00e1cticamente sin interrupci\u00f3n. Sin duda ser\u00e1n mas reducidas y mas aisladas geopol\u00edticamente que esta guerra porque ya nadie se atrever\u00e1 tan irresponsablemente a provocar una hecatombe semejante a la actual. Pero si bien podr\u00e1n ser guerras mas reducidas ser\u00e1n tanto mas deshonrosas. El honor en el campo de batalla ser\u00e1 definitivamente sepultado por la fr\u00eda y sistem\u00e1tica decisi\u00f3n de matar y destruir a cualquier precio.\" \n\n\n\"Los hombres se mataran por poseer las cosas mas superfluas y banales. Las plutocracias naufragaran en una desesperada carrera por dar cada vez mas lujos a la humanidad corrompida por la molicie. Al final las plutocracias terminaran por no poder dar de comer a una poblaci\u00f3n cada vez mas numerosa. Habr\u00e1 otra vez hambre de desocupados. Y vendr\u00e1 otra vez el bolcheviquismo a ofrecer tentadora mente las mismas soluciones falsas que nos ofrecieron a nosotros durante ese monstruoso monumento al fracaso y a la ignominia que fuera la rep\u00fablica de noviembre.\" \n\n\n\"Y aquellos que querr\u00e1n poner remedio a este estado de cosas no tendr\u00e1n otra alternativa que volver la vista hacia lo que nosotros hicimos y hacia aquello por lo cual seguiremos peleando hasta el amargo final. Aquellos que quieran mejorar este mundo decadente y corrupto tendr\u00e1n que comprender plutocracia y bolcheviquismo no son los dos \u00fanicos caminos transitables para redimir a la Humanidad de la miseria y el fracaso. Por que hay un tercer camino que es el nuestro, que es lo \u00fanico y el mejor y que es aquel que ADOLF HITLER nos se\u00f1alara.\" \n\n\n\"Vendr\u00e1n hombres que aun sin mencionarnos, porque les estar\u00e1 prohibido o porque temer\u00e1n hacerlo, intentaran transitar por este camino nuestro. Y ser\u00e1n combatidos y traicionados al igual que nosotros lo fuimos. Pero al final VENCEREMOS porque lo bueno y lo verdadero siempre triunfa en este mundo\". \n\n\nBerl\u00edn, 19 de abril de 1945. \n\nJOSEPH GOEBBELS.", "title": "\u00daltimo discurso de Joseph Goebbels (Berl\u00edn, 19 de abril de 1945.)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-02T11:03:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1XxdWP3uB7I", "description": "Klub Studencki Kwadrat - 10.10.2014\nPocz\u0105tek 30 sek", "title": "Bracia Figo Fagot - Janko, Janeczko (Klub Kwadrat, Krak\u00f3w)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T15:54:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Xxfhl8a71o", "description": "DUBSTEP VERSION: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xm7rq_1RSk\n\nThe Radox Hooky Hook advert.

Support Theishter on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/theishter\n\n-\n\nThis fall season is amazing. For me, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is #1 on the list (dat OP theme), followed by Parasyte, F/SN: UBW, and Psycho Pass 2. I still need to start a couple of series, but those are my priority every week. Let me know what you think of the new season!!\n\n\n\nHere are my early anime impressions:\n\u2022 Parasyte - Love it. Very very interesting premise. At first, there was a question of \"is this thing a bad guy or not?\" and relief when it's revealed as neutral (and somewhat benevolent). Its voice actress sounds like Aya Hirano. That dubstep though... \n\n\u2022 F/SN: Unlimited Budget Works - amazing, detailed, fluid animation. Archer and Rin's character chemistry = perfect. Taiga's character = perfect. Makes me wish Earth's rotation to be faster so next week would come quicker. \n\n\u2022 Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - I've never related to an anime so strongly before this... ;__; \n\n\u2022 Psycho-Pass 2 - Too early to tell. The animation and art looks decent though, despite the change in animation studio.\n\n\n\nMIDI: http://www4.zippyshare.com/v/72947500/file.html\n\n\n- - - - - -\n\nSupport Theishter on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/theishter\nNew website: http://www.theishter.com\nThe book of my face: http://www.facebook.com/ishter\nIshter twitter: http://www.twitter.com/tehishter\n\n- - - - - -\n\nPiano arrangement by Tehishter\n\nOriginal song:\n-Composed, Arranged, and Lyrics by TK\n-Performed by Ling Tosite Sigure\n\n- - - - -", "title": "Psycho-Pass 2 OP - Enigmatic Feeling", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T22:28:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YHMmD0jSuY", "description": "", "title": "BB 15000 ANCIEN DECO + CORAIL COUCHETTE", "publishedDate": "2013-12-04T22:22:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YHRSZRHEto", "description": "\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9ESPA\u00d1OL\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cf\nEl Himno nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Socialista Sovi\u00e9tica de Lituania fue oficial durante la \u00e9poca de la naci\u00f3n b\u00e1ltica como integrante de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica.\nEl himno fue adoptado en 1950 por decisi\u00f3n del gobierno lituano.

The music was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas \u0160vedas, and the original lyrics authored by Antanas Venclova. After Joseph Stalin's death, Vacys Reimeris changed the second stanza of the lyrics to remove mention of Stalin. The second stanza lyrics were changed to state that Lenin had lit the path to freedom, helped by the Russian people, led by the party (Reimeris changed the word \"Stalin\" to \"party\") and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics.

It's how possibilities happen through careful navigation.\nThere are no dead ends.\n    Mark fundamental landmark differences in analogically mimiced patterns,\nfor possible classification category augmentations (for navigation and\ndata retrieval purposes). Beware of oversimplification of data streams\nin order to fit a pattern into a perceptual mold.\n    Even if my ideas overlap with existing knowledge, they provide a new way\nof understanding that knowledge, and that is valuable because my ideas \nare not based on mimicry since I haven't studied topics related to them\nmuch (except a college philosophy course and K-13 math). These ideas\nexist for the most part in their own context. They can be no doubt eventually\nbe linked to ideas in other contexts though.

This variation in oblateness is in very ideal form and is 100% variation but actually for different calestial objects oblateness variation value is different. From black holes, galaxies, stars, planets, their moons the value of variation in oblateness decrease.  Also the meaning of variable oblateness that scientists have been studying in some stars, the sun, planets & the earth is only variation in polar & equatorial radius. But the meaning of variable oblateness according to my ideas is different. According to me all celestial objects & universe oscillate between two different confocal oblate spheroids. In all celestial objects & universe dark matter & dark energy have the structure of confocal oblate spheroids. So all celestial objects & universe contract & expand according to this oscillatory geometries. In this oscillation I also show variation in polar & equatorial radiation but I have a new method of variation in oblateness that is different and new. I also say about variation in oblateness and variation in polar and equatorial radius but I am adding or including two new and different condition with this variation. What I am including is to first include confocal property of a oblate spheroid and second twisting and squeezing a confocal oblate spheroids. Twisting in reverse directions in both hemispheres and squeezing on poles. So there will be variation in polar & equatorial radius already but now I have added or included two new condition. First : variable oblateness according to oscillation between two different confocal oblate spheroids and Second : twisting in reverse or opposite directions in both hemispheres and squeezing on poles in oscillatory nature between two different confocal oblate spheroids.

Its species name refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of color on its fur. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns. It stands 5--6 m (16--20 ft) tall and has an average weight of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) for males and 830 kg (1,800 lb) for females. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.\n\nThe giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are preyed on by lions, and calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through \"necking\", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.\n\nThe giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern, but has been extirpated from many parts of its former range, and some subspecies are classified as Endangered. Nevertheless, giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves.\n\nFully grown giraffes stand 5--6 m (16--20 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,630 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,830 lb) for an adult female. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height. Giraffes see in color and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants. The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 50 cm (20 in) long. It is purplish-black in color, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose. The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging. The lips, tongue and inside of the mouth are covered in papillae to protect against thorns.\n\nThe coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown or nearly black in color) separated by light hair (usually white or cream in color). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern serves as camouflage, allowing it to blend in the light and shade patterns of savanna woodlands. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern. The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray. It is also thick and allows it to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odor than the females, the odor may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-meter (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.", "title": "Giraffe Sticking His Head Into The Bus At The Wild Animal Safari Park In Pine Mountain Georgia", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T15:22:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Yb-vakX6Bk", "description": "Chef Michael Mina teaches us how to make tahini from scratch.

Since the late 19th century, zombies have acquired notable popularity, especially in North American and European folklore.\nIn modern times, the term \"zombie\" has been applied to an undead being in horror fiction, largely drawn from George A.

His Party Charter for the nascent Nazional Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei demanded in Article 24, in contrast to strong Christian control of German's spiritual life, \"complete freedom of religion\" (in so far, of course, as that was not a \"danger to Germany\") (William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Arrow, 1991). Indeed, the official \"Nazi Party Philosopher\", Alfred Rosenberg, (later to be hanged at Nuremberg), appointed of course with Hitler's consent, was totally opposed to Christianity. However, Hitler the politician was also aware that to achieve power he would need to win votes from the Catholic Centre Party and could not afford total alienation.\n\nUpon attaining office and enjoying a free hand, what line did Hitler take on religion and the Church? Five days after becoming Chancellor in 1933, Hitler allowed a sterilization law to pass, and had the Catholic Youth League disbanded (Shirer, The Rise). The latter was a measure applied to other youth organizations too, in order to free up young people to join the Hitler Youth. Parents were pressured to take their children out of religious schools. When the Church organized voluntary out-of-hours religious classes, the Nazi government responded by banning state-employed teachers from taking part. The Crucifix symbol was even at one point banned from classrooms in one particular jurisdiction, Oldenburg, in 1936, but the measure met with fierce public resistance and was rescinded. Hitler remained conscious of the affection for the Church felt in some quarters of Germany, particularly Bavaria. Later on, though, a wartime metal shortage was used as the excuse for melting church bells (Richard Grunberger, The Twelve Year Reich, Henry Holt, Henry Holt, 1979 and Richard Grunberger, A Social History of the Third Reich, Penguin, 1991).\n\nHitler's references to providence and God and the ritualistic pageantry of Nazism were more than likely pagan than Christian. Earthly symbols of German valour and Teutonic strength were to be worshipped - not the forgiving, compassionate representative of an \"Eastern Mediterranean servant ethic imposed on credulous ancient Germans by force and subterfuge\" (the phrase is Burleigh's own, in Michael Burleigh, The Third Reich: a New History, Pan, 2001).\n\nThe SS were particularly anti-Christian, and officers and men were encouraged to leave the Church, although those that refused to renounce their Christian faith were not visibly punished, perhaps because their otherwise faithful adherence to SS codes of behaviour gave the lie to any claim of true Christian affiliation. The SS also brought in its own neo-pagan rituals for marriage ceremonies and baptisms.\n\nOriginal Article at: http://www.bede.org.uk/hitler.htm\nAdditional Information available at: http://atheismexposed.tripod.com/hitler_atheist.htm", "title": "Dinesh D'Souza lecturing at New York University on Hitler's Religious Views", "publishedDate": "2012-10-17T20:51:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YqpZl4f4Ds", "description": "Sperm of Mankind - Jingle bells from their Album Merry XXX-Mass\nhttp://www.myspace.com/spermofmankind\n\nSupport the Band, don't be an a**hole buy the stuff If you like it!", "title": "Sperm of Mankind - Jingle Bells", "publishedDate": "2009-12-16T18:08:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YqqUXqLW9Y", "description": "Hudba: Grimaso\nKamera a strih: DoubleJ\nR\u00e9\u017eia: Bacil & Rakby\nfacebook.com/bacil.rakby\nkupuj album ABNORMAL : http://smarturl.it/Abnormal", "title": "Bacil & Rakby - Flow (feat.

The signals remain mixed. The apparent power of the Muslim Brotherhood and others of similar fervency is frankly worrisome. The economies of these countries -- Egypt particularly -- are in the doldrums and don't look like they will escape soon. The specter of civil war hangs over Libya. Syria is in a civil war. Yemen and Bahrain remain in turmoil, among rumblings elsewhere. And Tunisia, the first and most benign transition, is also enthralled to some tendencies toward extreme political Islam.\nFor a time, the two peaceful transitions in North Africa looked like they might follow the much-touted \"Turkish model,\" the remarkably successful cohabitation of Islamic practice in society but largely secular and democratic governance. Turkey has a booming economy, political freedom, and increasing influence from Morocco to Central Asia. (It also has badly handled its large Kurdish population, which is a model of how not to promote political pluralism and respect for minority rights.) Several leaders of the Arab Spring have spoken warmly of Turkey's exemplary mixture of faith and democracy.\nBut lip service to the Turkish model is not being put into practice. And there are plenty of worrying signals that run in the opposite direction -- namely, toward the imposition of Sharia Law, repression of women, and continuing marginalization of minorities.\nA report about Tunisia issued last week by a team of women activists in Washington (who are colleagues of mine) underscores the momentous challenge of these Arab transitions. The situation in Tunisia, they say, reflects what is happening more broadly:\nTunisia, like its neighbors Libya and Egypt, is witnessing the sudden burgeoning of conservative Islamists, particularly Salafis, as a political force. To many Tunisians they are neither indigenous nor representative of the mass democratic movement that ousted Ben Ali. People believe they are financed by regional actors, such as the Arab Gulf states and Saudi Arabia, and are pushing an ideological agenda that counters Tunisia's more tolerant history. \"We ask them 'where were you?! Who are you?!\" says one activist, implying that the Salafis were not part of the popular protests, but now are taking advantage of the open space to assert dominance.\nIndeed, one of the most worrisome aspects of the violent uprisings in Libya and Syria, and possibly elsewhere, is how the most extreme Islamists--the fundamentalists Salafis--may be getting crucial support from the Saudis, whose interests are many but among them is promoting Wahhabism, its brand of conservative religion and politics.\nThe concern about the fate of women in the Arab transition states has been gradually gaining force. A year ago, the only article I could find about the fate of women in the Arab Spring was by Shahin and Juan Cole. Now, many more are speaking out -- notably, women in these very Arab countries, like the remarkable tirade by Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy in Foreign Policy, \"Why Do They Hate Us?\"\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-tirman/arab-spring_b_1455537.html?ref=world", "title": "The Islamists & The Arab Spring \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a : \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T18:41:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YweClyuIsk", "description": "Download this karaoke song (MP3, MP4, WMV or MP3+G formats available)\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/store/store.html?vid=20081002001&cid=4042&keyword=Im+A+Man\n\nSing, record and share this karaoke song online:\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/online/#sid=29291\n\nOr get The KARAOKE Channel Mobile App and take this karaoke song to go!\nhttp://www.thekaraokechannel.com/mobile/", "title": "I'm A Man in the Style of \"Bo Diddley\" with lyrics (with lead vocal)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T06:32:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YxCMcztP3I", "description": "Periquito-rico\nEnglish Name: Plain Parakeet\nFamilia: Psittacidae\nGravado (recorded) 02 de dezembro 2012", "title": "Brotogeris tirica", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T11:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YxEj3xifxI", "description": "QAD Purchase Requisition Approval from Mobile UI\nMore info at: \nhttp://www.32soft.com/blog/web-solutions-for-qad/online-requisition-system-for-qad-2/", "title": "QAD Purchase Requisition Approval from Mobile UI - 32 Soft", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05T21:21:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1YxVDLfHfQg", "description": "L'association la Rimienne & esprit d'\u00e9b\u00e8ne organise l'\u00e9lection MISS MAURITANIE FRANCE 2\u00e8me \u00e9dition. \n\n\u00e0 300m de la Tour Eiffel ...

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W.

This was in reference to the short skirts \"that barely cover the buttocks\" worn by women of the tribe, and which were \"probably shocking\" to observers of the han people during the Middle Ages and Modern Age .\n\nThe shortening of the skirts are produced from the very beginning also in that of other animals, such as the more traditional women's clothing, giving birth to the mini-dresses, which effectively united t-shirts and sweaters to the concept of mini-skirt, even these often worn with the tights.\n\nMore and more frequent use of short skirts and mini-dresses joined for a short period, the abandonment of the bra, which was often burned by feminists as a sign of protest and support for a new idea of the woman, not linked to the image Previous whose traditional clothing (long dresses and bra) were a symbol.\n\nBetween 1984 to 1986, the British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who at the time worked in Italy, launched a new kind of skirt called mini-horsehair, composed by the fusion of a tutu dancing with a rigid structure derived from crioline used Victorian era, but its success was confined almost exclusively to the world of fashion and entertainment.\n\nAs for the world of fashion the skirt has always been present, albeit with variations in its length and frequency of its presence in the lines of clothing presented in the various annual collections. In the mid-nineties some designers (including Valentine's Day ) and some fashion critics, in contrast to the models that were proposing the television and the cinema, had announced the abandonment of the miniskirt, now considered a garment of the past, but already a few years after this came back strongly on the catwalks.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011 the Government of Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist country, announced the possibility of banning miniskirts in public places, as part of a new policy for the moralization of the country.", "title": "Very Short Mini Skirt Comparison in Singapore", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T08:05:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Zg6XQk-05A", "description": "Hayward's Salt & Swim overview video.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei warns that a US led attack on Syria would be disastrous. Considered the most powerful leader in Iran, Khamenei has been described as one of only three people having \"important influence\" during the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khamenei holds the title of Sayyid, which means that he claims direct patrilineal descent from Ali. Khamenei was a key figure in the Iranian Revolution in Iran and a close confidant of Ruhollah Khomeini. Khamenei is one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy. Khamenei has called human rights a fundamental principle underlying Islamic teachings, that precedes western concern for human rights by many centuries. Human Rights in Islam include the rights to live, to be free, and to benefit from justice and welfare. He has attacked Western powers who have criticized the rights record of the Islamic Republic for hypocrisy saying that these countries economically oppress people in Third World countries and support despots and dictators. In response to Western complaints of human rights abuses in Iran he has stated that the American administration has committed many crimes and is therefore not fit to judge the Islamic Republic.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuttF5ek8f8\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This Video may contain copyrighted (\u00a9 ) material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Fermentation is a very traditional practice, it has been used all across the globe. It helps us maintain our foods after the harvest is finished and it also improves nutrition. \n\nWhen you ferment cabbage into sauerkraut or kimchi, you increase B vitamins, particularly folate, as well as vitamin C. When you ferment, you take a fresh food such as beets or cabbage and you grate it and salt it and pound it until the juices are released, it creates an environment that keeps pathogenic bacteria at bay while probiotics, the good bacteria grows. \n\nIn a week to 10 days, you have a super nutrient-dense food that is filled with beneficial bacteria. Jenny only uses unrefined sea salt when she ferments vegetables. \n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR MORE HEALTHY VIDEO TIPS AND REPORTS!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=undergroundwellness\n\nFREE STUFF!\nChasing Symptoms video e-course: http://www.chasingsymptoms.com\n\nLET'S CONNECT!\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/undergroundwellness\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/ugwellness\nBlogTalk Radio: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/undergroundwellness\nThe Blog: http://www.undergroundwellness.com\nUW on iTunes - http://bit.ly/uwitunes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njerfitup", "title": "What is Fermentation?", "publishedDate": "2011-02-04T09:50:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ZqDMYC2T9k", "description": "Assembling The Hoist..now just waiting for the lift ram.", "title": "Assembling The Hoist", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T00:34:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ZqcxI_XATI", "description": "You may have seen that image purportedly showing the alarming spread of Fukushima radiation across the Pacific.

Most parts of the plant are edible, medicinal and have other fantastic properties. See more: http://awalkaroundbritain.com/knowledge/plant-and-tree/plant-profiles/rosebay-willowherb/\n\nThis herb is often abundant in wet calcareous to slightly acidic soils in open fields, pastures, and particularly burned-over lands; the name Fireweed derives from the species' abundance as a coloniser on burnt sites after forest fires. Its tendency to quickly colonize open areas with little competition, such as sites of forest fires and forest clearings, makes it a clear example of a pioneer species.  The reddish-brown linear seed capsule splits from the apex. It bears many minute brown seeds, about 300 to 400 per capsule and 80,000 per plant.  : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilobium_angustifolium \n\nWillowherbs are typically very quick to carpet large swathes of ground and may become key or dominant species of local ecosystems. In and around the United Kingdom, for example, rosebay willowherb (E. angustifolium) is widely found in mesotrophic grassland dominated by false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and red fescue (Festuca rubra), while great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum) is found in mesotrophic grassland with stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). These two willowherb species are also seen to dominate open habitat early in ecological succession, to the virtual exclusion of other plant life. Broad-leaved willowherb (Epilobium montanum) is found characteristically, though not abundantly, in the mesotrophic grasslands with meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and sometimes the uncommon Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum), which are peculiar to the Pennines. Most willowherbs will not tolerate shade trees and thus are limited to more recently disturbed patches, yielding to other plants over time. Consequently, though the genus contains many pioneer plants, rather few of them are invasive weeds of major importance. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamerion \n\nRosebay willowherb is tolerant of acid and alkaline soils but does not grow in soils with poor mineral nutrition. Rosebay willowherb tolerates shade and a broad range of climatic conditions. It is suspected by some botanists that the sudden spread of rosebay willowherb was due to the introduction of the North American form that has 72 chromosomes while the native form has 36. Considerable intraspecific variation has been observed in rosebay willowherb in North America where it is eaten by deer and range cattle. It was also used as a food plant by the native indians. The nectar is important for hive bees in certain localities. Seeds remain viable for 18 months but do not form a persistent seedbank. Seeds lose viability after 18 months dry storage at room temperature but persist for more than 2 years stored dry at 5\u00b0C.   : http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/organicweeds/weed_information/weed.php?id=116 \n\n\u00c1 \u00edslandi finnst fylgjandi jurtir af d\u00fanurtum:\nLindad\u00fanurt (Epilobium alsinifolium)\nFjallad\u00fanurt (Epilobium anagallidifolium)\nSigursk\u00fafur (Chamerion angustifolium)\nV\u00e6tud\u00fanurt (Epilobium ciliatum)\nKlappad\u00fanurt (Epilobium collinum)\nHei\u00f0ad\u00fanurt (Epilobium hornemannii)\nLj\u00f3sad\u00fanurt (Epilobium lactiflorum)\nEyrarr\u00f3s (Chamerion latifolium)\nM\u00fdrad\u00fanurt (Epilobium palustre)\n\nSigursk\u00fafur  er tilt\u00f6lulega n\u00fd r landnemi \u00e1 \u00cdslandi : http://nature.is/frettir/1764/\n\nUnfortunately handheld, with such a macro and a minuscule depth of field the video is shaky and not always on focus.", "title": "Willowherb - Sigursk\u00fafur - D\u00fanurt - Villijurtir  - Sumarbl\u00f3m", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T19:19:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ZzosdFHOac", "description": "stacey belching for over 2 mins.", "title": "Stacey belching", "publishedDate": "2009-07-26T15:04:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Zzua_0tgMU", "description": "HobbyKidsTV presents an out of the box experience!

The song was introduced in the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls, which opened at the 46th Street Theater on November 24, 1950. It was performed on stage by Vivian Blaine, who later reprised her role as Miss Adelaide in the 1955 film version of the play. \"A Bushel and a Peck,\" however, was not included in the film.\n\nA recording by Perry Como and Betty Hutton (made on September 12, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 47-3930) first reached the Billboard magazine charts on October 27, 1950 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at #6. Doris Day's recording (made on September 13, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as 78rpm catalog number 39008 and 45rpm catalog number 6-838) made the chart on January 5, 1951 at #30 for one week. Many other recording artists also did versions of the song.\n\nOn Cash Box magazine's Best-Selling Record charts, where all versions of the song are combined, the song reached #5 on December 2, 1950. The song gained so much popularity before the musical actually began that it was moved from its original spot opening the second act into the first act!!\n\nThe number, in context of the show, can be performed either as \"Miss Adelaide and her Chick Chick Chickedies,\" where the girls are dressed in yellow feathers, or as \"Miss Adelaide and the Hot Box Farmerettes,\" where skimpy plantation outfits are worn (often jean cutoffs and checkered racing shirts or short gingham sundresses).\n\nThe Andrews Sisters' version of the song was a hit in 1953, hitting #22 on the US charts.\n\nLYRICS\nI love you a bushel and a peck\nA bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck\nA hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap\nA barrel and a heap and I'm talkin' in my sleep\nAbout you, about you\n'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck\nYou bet your pretty neck I do\n\nDoodle-oodle-ooh-doo \n\nI love you a bushel and a peck\nA bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck\nMake my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess\nMake my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness\nAbout you, about you\n'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck\nYou bet your pretty neck I do\n\nDoodle-oodle-ooh-doo", "title": "A Bushel and a Peck - A CAPPELLA Andrews Sisters (Christy-Lyn)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-14T10:59:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_01IPzj4O4", "description": "Taste of the Hawaiian Range Event, Big Island Hawaii 2010\n\nTim O.

The band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). Although their initial musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to The Beatles, the Beau Brummels later worked with other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.\n\nThe band broke into the mainstream with their debut single, \"Laugh, Laugh,\" for which they would later be credited for setting the aesthetic foundation for the San Francisco Sound. The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing the Beau Brummels, and top 10 single \"Just a Little.\" Although the group's commercial success dwindled by the following year, their albums of the late 1960s received critical acclaim.\n\nThe band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from his diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he received an induction notice into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre. The Beau Brummels were a trio for 1967's Triangle album. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members for that year's Bradley's Barn album. The duo parted ways in 1969 to record solo material and participate in projects by other artists.

Learn why the angle \n\n\n\nProving the angle for inclined planes\n\nConfused on where to put the angle on inclined plane problems? Don't feel like memorizing it? Let's prove this using three basic principles from geometry:\nA straight line is 180\u00ba\nA triangle has a total of 180\u00ba\nA right angle is 90\u00ba\n\n\nFrom the last video we learned that rotating the coordinate axis could save us time and effort. But when doing it, we need to brake up the force of gravity into parts parallel and perpendicular to the surface. Notice how I draw the perpendicular part of gravity following right below the normal force.  Anything perpendicular to the surface is a right angle, or 90\u00ba.\n\nDid you notice how long arrow is for the force of gravity? I've made it longer this time so you can see how it forms a right angle with the with the base of the slope.\n\nNow, all the angles in a triangle must add to 180\u00ba. This means that the angle on the top of the slop must be 60\u00ba.\n\nLet's make an arc that reminds us that a line is 180\u00ba.  \n\nSo if one point of the line to the other is 180\u00ba, and we know that 90\u00ba and 60\u00ba are taken care of, we are only missing what's left. So we take 180\u00ba-90\u00ba-60\u00ba and get 30\u00ba. \n\nAnd that is why we use can use the angle of the slope in our similar triangle.", "title": "How to choose the angle for inclined plane problems", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T04:42:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_JTqTl0_8Y", "description": "Enslaved talk to O2 Academy TV about their new album and also hear more about their old Norse roots.

But on Sunday a German man broke the world record, carrying 27 full mugs.\n\nOliver Struempfel works at the traditional Gillemoos beer festival in the Bavarian town of Abensberg.\n\n\"I have worked here in the beer tent for the past 17 years, so I have had lots of training in carrying the beer mugs. However, my personal best is 26 mugs at once, which is more than 60 kilograms and so it is no longer enough to just carry the mugs , but you have to support the training by going to the gym, especially in Winter when you don't get much time carrying the beer mugs,\" Struempfel told Reuters TV.\n\nBut the training doesn't come without its hazards, he explained:\n\n\"Of course it has happened to me before that some beer mugs have fallen down; three years ago 23 beer mugs fell down at once,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Struempfel was up against just one competitor and they had to carry as many full mugs as possible a distance of 40 metres.\n\nCheered on by the crowds inside the beer festival tent, Struempfel's opponent managed 26 mugs, each weighing around 2.3 kilograms.\n\nBut Struempfel went one better with 27.\n\nThe world record holder said he has had lots of practice, as he began training when he was a teenager, filling beer mugs with water. He then went on to make a career out of it.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "German Breaks World Record for Carrying Most Beer Mugs", "publishedDate": "2014-09-08T13:18:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_ehTc7GCvs", "description": "\u9ad8\u624b\u5728\u6c11\u9593, \u4e00\u540d\u6295\u884cMD \u5411\u5728\u505a\u6bd2\u679cLIVE\u7bc0\u76ee\u7684\u674e\u5ee2\u73b2\u674e\u6f22\u5978\u6311\u6a5f , \u70ba\u6c11\u767c\u8072!", "title": "\u9ad8\u624b\u5728\u6c11\u9593 \u6295\u884cMD\u6311\u6a5f\u674e\u5ee2\u73b2\u674e\u6f22\u5978", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T12:34:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_elhnfqITc", "description": "EYE FLOATER LASER SURGERY BY SCOTT GELLER MD FORT MYERS FLORIDA USA\nwww.vitreousfloaters.com", "title": "EYE FLOATER LASER #8", "publishedDate": "2008-02-27T04:38:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_fBY5UG-Q4", "description": "http://www.permies.com\n\nHelen Atthowe of http://www.veganicpermaculture.com talks about using winter annuals as a lving mulch.

You can also keep a 'Yearly record' and learn how to track  your  palmer lines changing over the years, and compare them to the changes  that you may have experienced in life. There are many fine lines on a hand that come and go quite quickly, They seem not related to any folding of the hand. This has been described as the ''Action of the Brain upon the Hand'' . The main lines also  change but much slower , and for usually more powerful changes.   There are other ways of obtaining a handprint .. Ideas are range from   Face paints to  Lipstick. !..

In the report, which uses information from unnamed sources within the label, it is revealed that Sosa was released from his contract due to tensions surrounding the handling of Keef's upcoming album and the overall direction of his career. The report states that Keef's camp tried to get moving on the album and get it out, but the label wasn't interested, which lead to arguments with officials at Interscope and eventually lead to Keef being dropped.\n\nSosa originally signed with Interscope in 2012 and went on to release his only album on the label, Finally Rich, which has sold around 200,000 units since its release. It's worth noting that Keef's upcoming project, Back From the Dead 2, which he put up for pre-order on iTunes last night, does not list Interscope as the label, but rather Glo Gang/GBE. We will continue to update this story when more details are made available.\n\nUpdate: Chief Keef has confirmed on Twitter that he was dropped from Interscope a week ago. \n\nSubscribe to Complex for More: http://goo.gl/PJeLOl\nCheck out more of Complex here:\nhttp://www.complex.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ComplexMag\nhttps://www.facebook.com/complex\nhttp://instagram.com/complexmag\nhttps://plus.google.com/+complex/\n\nEntertaining videos that bring to life Complex Media's authoritative take on trendsetting music, sneakers, style, pop culture, video games, tech, cars, and art\u2014featuring your favorite celebrities from the past, present, and future.

PKU is a rare metabolic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 20,000 newborns.  People with PKU lack an enzyme in the liver that breaks down phenylalanine, an essential amino acid in protein.  Without being on a highly restricted diet, this amino acid builds up in the blood and causes severe brain damage.  The diet does not involve simply being a vegan.  Grains, beans and soy are high in protein and cannot be eaten.  Protein, and therefore phenylalanine, is in everything except water, sugar, oil, vinegar and pure starches.  Fruits and vegetables are allowed in the PKU diet, but only in measured amounts.  As there are no grains permitted, baked goods are made with fragile starches instead. \n \nMolly has been on a low protein diet since she was diagnosed.  She is an incredibly bright and articulate eight year old who excells in all subjects in school.  While she struggles with the feelings of being left out in social situations due to her special diet, she still manages to see the bright side of things.  As her mom, I could not be more proud.\n\nThank you!", "title": "PKU -- Molly's Story", "publishedDate": "2009-03-05T16:51:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_lZSVTMWIk", "description": "Faux contact est une s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e belge en 169 \u00e9pisodes, cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Manu Thoreau, Charlie Dupont et Beno\u00eet Forget, produite par Tourne Sol Production, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Michael Havenith et diffus\u00e9e entre 1997 et 2000 sur Canal+ Belgique (devenue ensuite BeTV) puis La Une (RTBF).

Combining these data with molecular sequences, we obtained a phylogenetic tree that, when calibrated with fossils, shows that crown clade Placentalia and placental orders originated after the K-Pg boundary. Many nodes discovered using molecular data are upheld, but phenomic signals overturn molecular signals to show Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) as the sister taxon of Primates, a close link between Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (sea cows), and the monophyly of echolocating Chiroptera (bats).

This free video was created for you by  and can be used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this Educational Music video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe education song can be defined as a multidirectional process whereby transmitting knowledge, values \u200b\u200b, customs and behaviors. education song not only occurs through the word, as it is present in all our actions, feelings and attitudes. For this reason it is very important to differentiate education song enforced and inculcated instruction or indoctrination, education song man is an active subject that is largely guided by the induction or even also of abductive reasoning, though mostly by deduction instead the subject of instruction or indoctrination is one that just repeats the information to be instilled. Ie genuine education song is a learning.\n\nNon-formal education song: refers to courses, schools, and institutions, which are not governed by a particular curriculum of studies, these are intended to educate but not recognized by the certificates. Informal education song: is that which is received mainly in the social sectors, it is education song that progressively acquired throughout life, is given without any Educational Music purpose. The history of education song is limited to the division of the ages of women.\n\nPreschool, primary and secondary education song is the stage of training of individuals in which thinking skills and core competencies to promote systematic and continuous learning and dispositions and attitudes that govern their lives unfold. Getting all children, girls and adolescents in the country have the same or similar opportunities to pursue and successfully complete basic education song in order to achieve learning established for each grade level, are critical to sustain development of the nation. In basic education song of good quality development of basic skills and learning achievement of students is the central purposes are goals which teachers, school system and direct their efforts.\n\nEnculturation of individuals through which physical and intellectual abilities, skills, study skills and ways of behavior, ordered with a social purpose. In many Western countries the school or formal education song is free for all students. However, due to the shortage of public schools, there are also many private and parochial schools. The function of education song is to help and guide the learner to retain and use the values \u200b\u200bof the culture that is imparted, strengthening national identity. education song encompasses many areas; as formal, informal and non-formal.\n\nBut the term education song refers mainly to the orderly influence on a person to form it and develop several complementary levels; in most cultures is the action exerted by the young adult generation to pass on and preserve their collective existence. It is a fundamental to human life and society ingredient and dates back to the origins of man. education song is what transmits culture, allowing its evolution.\n\nIn some countries like Mexico education song is divided into two or more types, they in turn are subdivided into levels such as basic education song, Secondary education song and Higher education song. The divisions vary according to the Educational Music policies of each country. The Unesco has an International Standard Classification of education song, which includes levels and topics.\n\nUnlike what happens with children and young people themselves that often go to school because their parents send them rather than out of conviction or because the need to have some knowledge. All this leads to the existence of two Educational Music streams depending on students, pedagogy for children and young people and for adults andragogy.\n\nEducational Music evaluation is a systematic process and directed, in which a number of elements involved, eg a test or practice in vocational training, a theatrical performance in a school, an integrative project, an essay test in the computer learning etc.. Currently, the best systems of education song in the service of education song, and therefore remains a central goal of Educational Music programs the simple transmission of information and knowledge. One could also say that there is some need to train students in self-learning as a process of personal development. Each student is a unique being, showing a key element in the evaluation process: assess not only evaluated, but to enhance learning and to the organization of work, among other methodological aspects. Under the Educational Music perspective, the evaluation must acquire a new dimension, and thus give a sense of relevance to teaching and learning.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!", "title": "vevo Amazing Rasta singing Song about Education", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T16:41:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_w9Hw31wYk", "description": "", "title": "Kazan Kaziev   Skripach1", "publishedDate": "2012-09-16T07:49:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_wf5p5Rm4M", "description": "why do I even do this to myself.\n\nDISCLAIMER;\nnone of the videos belong to me, I just made this \"trailer\" sort of thing and mashed a bunch of videos together. all credits go to their rightful owners. \n\nthe fanfiction was not written by me, but by the lovely changdictator who can make anyone cry their eyes out. a big thank you to her who wrote it!\n\nlink to Anterograde Tomorrow written by changdictator: http://changdictator.livejournal.com/3484.html\n\nmy twitter: https://twitter.com/itschristineboo\n\nenjoy watching the video!", "title": "[anterograde tomorrow] memories vanished; kaisoo", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T03:19:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1_x0dSgKi9c", "description": "If you think Formula One drivers can't drive, you're stupid, if you think NASCAR drivers can't drive, you're stupid.

Try also the vegetarian version with grilled zucchini... \nFind this and many more recipes with pictures on the Giallozafferano App (in English) http://itunes.apple.com/app/giallozafferano-recipes/id384387249?mt=8\n\n***\n\nHere's the ingredients we'll need for today's recipe, a tasty appetizer, ready in 30 minutes: the eggs in bacon baskets! Crack the eggs... now add the heavy cream, as an alternative you can replace it with ricotta cheese or a couple of tablespoons of mascarpone cheese... 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese... beat everything... until you have an even mixture. If you want to make the eggs richer, you can add more cheese or vegetables, but take care to finely dice them, so they'll bake evenly. Now add salt... pepper, and the roughly torn basil leaves... be generous with basil!\nGive another stir... and take the pan: we'll use a muffin pan, because our baked eggs will look a bit like muffins. Take a slice of bacon... lay the second one crosswise... and line the rest of the muffin cup. If you don't have a muffin pan, you can use aluminum baking cups, that you can find at the supermarket, or ceramic ramekins, like this. You don't need to grease the pan, since bacon is fat enough and it won't stick to the pan.\nThey're ready, now pour the egg mixture into each basket. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 12-15 minutes, until the eggs are cooked and golden brown.\nOur eggs in bacon baskets are ready, serve with a fresh salad. For a vegetarian version, you can use grilled zucchini instead of bacon, but take care to line the mould with parchment paper... good, easy and quick!\nWe used:\nFor 12 servings:\n\u2022 5 eggs\n\u2022 less than 1 cup (200 ml) of heavy cream\n\u2022 24 slices of bacon \u2022 2-3 tbsp of parmesan cheese\n\u2022 a few basil leaves\n\u2022 salt and pepper to taste", "title": "Eggs in bacon baskets - quick recipe", "publishedDate": "2012-01-25T13:59:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a010IfZx5w", "description": "FOR MUSIC VIDEOS CONTACT GRAPHIK AT 804-548-6283 OR THISISGRAPHIK@GMAIL.COM", "title": "Ron Lee \"7 Days\" Ft Ogee #WillowBoyz (HD) By @THISISGRAPHIK", "publishedDate": "2014-04-03T19:36:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a09Mua7__s", "description": "S5821X: Backscratcher with Shoehorn & Chain\n- Reach any itch at any time!\n- Has curved fingers for scratching\n- Comes with a shoehorn & chain\n- Promote medical offices & retirement homes \n- Available in 7 colors; plastic", "title": "S5821X: Backscratcher with Shoehorn & Chain", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T20:06:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a1C2ol3kSY", "description": "Check out CBC Music:  http://www.cbcmusic.ca\nLIke us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/CBCMusic\nFollow us on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/cbc_music\n\nOn a beautiful summer day in Vancouver, Mike Rosenberg, better known to music fans around the world as Passenger, plugged in his guitar and played a set of music for quickly gathered crowd.\nHere is 'Rolling Stone'.", "title": "'Rolling Stone' by Passenger, Busking on the Streets", "publishedDate": "2013-07-24T20:11:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a1NJb6I5Jw", "description": "This car equally accelerates to S63 AMG 2009!", "title": "S600 W140 Almaty", "publishedDate": "2009-10-08T22:11:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a1QbIlJ0fc", "description": "", "title": "Chicken of the Woods", "publishedDate": "2014-08-09T01:00:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a1ehnW7lkc", "description": "Accepted in ICRA 2014\nwww-personal.umich.edu/~cforrest/", "title": "Fast Plane Extraction in Organized Point Clouds Using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering", "publishedDate": "2014-02-22T02:17:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a1yMnCb0jw", "description": "Faculty, staff and administration at Bakersfield College voice their support for a Baccalaureate Degree program at Bakersfield College.", "title": "Bakersfield College Baccalaureate Degree Support", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T22:18:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1a23f66RL7o", "description": "Brief expos\u00e9 of my globally unique pigeon colored varieties and other rare colored homing pigeons.

When her estranged father, Tiny, unexpectedly shows up at her Missouri home and asks her to go with him to New Orleans, Ellie seizes the chance to get away-and to maybe understand why her father abandoned his young family twenty years ago.\nFather and daughter follow the Mississippi River flyway from St. Louis to the Big Easy, dodging a crazed Kentucky sheriff hell-bent on catching Tiny and running into an eccentric cast of colorful characters. In the midst of late-night poker games, eating contests, and a near-drowning in the Mississippi River, Ellie's proximity to her father triggers blurred recollections of being dirty, of washing her hands again and again but never feeling clean. And when the images snap into focus, Ellie remembers the dark secrets she hid from herself since childhood.\n\nTo learn more or order the book:\nhttp://bookstore.iuniverse.com/Products/SKU-000090555/MISSISSIPPI-FLYWAY.aspx", "title": "MISSISSIPPI FLYWAY by Nel Rand", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T22:30:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1aATB_0iXHA", "description": "\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Commandoflauge/338861849598579?ref_type=bookmark \u25c4\u25c4\u25c4\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/Commandoflauge \u25c4\u25c4\u25c4\nDonate and support here: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=kenrichard1996%40gmail%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=https%3a%2f%2fwww%2eyoutube%2ecom%2fuser%2fCommandoflauge&item_number=Commandoflauge&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\n\nParody of Going To the Store\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZ2Sh5-XuM\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more skits and shit!\n\nWe're always welcoming volunteers to be in our videos!
