Cotter.\n\n\nSpeaker 1:  Do pet rabbits need to be bathed?  \n\nSpeaker 2:  Well, this is a confusing question because so many pet stores sell shampoo for animals.  People will buy the shampoo because it looks so cute or if there's a picture of a rabbit on the front of the bottle so that must mean that rabbits need to be bathed.  In fact, rabbits don't need to be bathed they are prodigious self groomers and they keep themselves immaculately clean.  But every once in a while for a variety of a reasons a rabbit will get a really poopy butt and maybe because he's sick because he's having a digestive problem.  It maybe because he's arthritic and he can't lean over to clean himself very well.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  Overweight?\n\nSpeaker 2:  He's overweight.  Yea, that's another reason why they can't lean over as well as before.  And they'll get an accumulation on their butt and it's kind of a poopy butt that dries on it's butt and then you have give him what's called a butt bath.  And what I use for a butt bath.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  Because you don't want to pick it off with your fingers because you can pull the skin away\n\nSpeaker 2:  Skin off with him. Exactly.  It's very painful for the rabbit.  So what you want to do is get a small litter box like this, put a towel in the bottom of it, put a couple of inches of water in it, tepid water, warm water, not hot just warm, and then you're going to put your bunny in the water and we're going to do this as a dry bath, He doesn't need a butt bath so we're just going to do this as if he did.  He knows he doesn't need a bath so he's stepping out so he's going to stay in this and when he's in you can pick him up like this.  Just hold is front quarters out to keep him dry and you can use your hand to swish water all around his butt.  Most rabbits are very comfortable doing this.  You can keep swishing water around his butt and you'll be loosening up the dry poop.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  So they're not sitting in water?\n\nSpeaker 2:  Just the butt.  That's right.  Just enough to cover the butt.  Towel is to give him traction and enough water to cover the butt and the bottom feet.  And that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1:  No soap?\n\nSpeaker 2:  You don't need soap.  Some people use shampoo or pet shampoo. You don't need that.  Just warm water is fine.  And you use your finger nails and pick the stuff off, once its moist you'll be able to get it off easily.  And then you take the bunny out onto a towel which we'll do here and most people like to use a hair dryer.  It's a tedious process.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  We did that one time.  \n\nSpeaker 2:  With Dusty?\n\nSpeaker 1:  No, with the crazy lady.\n\nSpeaker 2:  Oh that's right I remember that house call that we did.  We did a house call.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  That's another video.\n\nSpeaker 2:Yea. That's a whole other video.\n\nSpeaker 1: Annette.  Annette.\n\nSpeaker 2:  You're going to put the rabbit with his butt on the towel like this and you dry him as best you can. I like to also have a paper towel here because it's even more absorbent.  And you just keep pressing the paper towel against its butt.  And that will get him very very dry as dry as you can get without a hair dryer and then use a hair dryer set on low the lowest heat not on cold but the lowest heat and blow dry him until his butt is dry.  You don't want any skin chaffing because it's moist.  So that's how you give your bunny a butt bath.  It's pretty easy and the bunny really appreciates it.  You can tell that they like being clean.  Usually as soon as their out of the bath they'll do their face and their ears and everything.  \n\nSpeaker 1:  Oh.  Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2:  So yea, it's not a hard thing to do.  It's getting them dry is the trick.  So get them as dry as you can and you'll protect their skin that way.

Eat too many ... gain weight. Eat fewer ... lose weight. But many believe weight loss is more than a calorie equation, with so-called new-and-improved ways to lose weight being ever popular. Americans spend an estimated $42 billion annually on weight loss foods, products, and services. With that much money at stake, it's no surprise there are an overwhelming number of \"fad\" diets and other weight-loss products on the market.\n\nHaving so many diet options makes it difficult to know which ones to trust. For this reason, The Partnership for Healthy Weight Management has developed the \"Voluntary Guidelines for Providers of Weight Loss Products or Services.\" The mission for these guidelines is to \"promote sound guidance to the general public on strategies for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.\" According to the guidelines, effective weight management involves:\n\nBehavior modification that includes: \n\n\n*Dietary intervention\n- Healthful eating in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n- A reduction in calories\n- A lowered fat consumption\n- An increase in fruit, vegetable, and whole grain consumption\n\n\n*Physical activity\n- Increased frequency\n- At least moderate intensity \n\n\n\nVISIT: \n==========================\nhttp://Losing-Weight-Quickly.org\n==========================\n\n\nMedical, pharmacological, and surgical intervention: \n\n- May be necessary for people with more serious cases of overweight and obesity\n- Have to be used in conjunction with behavior, diet, and physical activity modifications \n\n\nIt is important to look for a plan that includes strategies for maintaining weight loss. There is nothing worse than regaining the weight that took you an enormous amount of hard work and patience to lose.\n\nMost popular diets are considered fad diets. There is no clear definition for what constitutes a fad diet. Merriam-Webster defines a fad as \"a practice or interest followed for a time with exaggerated zeal.\" Fad diets often promise quick results with a short time commitment. Long-term success requires permanent changes in behavior, diet, and activity.\n\nWays to spot a fad diet:\n\nIt claims fast weight loss\nClaims that sound too good to be true\nFoods defined as \"good\" and \"bad\"\nLess than 1,000 calories daily\nA required vitamin/mineral supplement or food product\nElimination of a major food group (grains, fats, meats, dairy, fruit, vegetables)\nLack of long-term randomized scientific studies proving the diet works and is safe. A randomized study distributes participants in a deliberately random way into either the non-tested diet group or the special diet group. Some fad diets state there is research to support their claims, but the research is only done with a few people or does not exist.\nElimination of an essential nutrient (carbohydrates, fats, proteins)\nNo activity or exercise needed\nIt's written by someone with no expertise in weight management \n\n\nThe following review examines the advantages and disadvantages of several popular diet plans. Many of the diets emphasize the restriction of one nutrient as the basis for their plan. The other food groups and nutrients are allowed in limited or unlimited quantities, depending on the plan. Weight loss is impossible without a calorie restriction, so each diet has to provide fewer calories than your body needs to maintain your weight. Any diet that claims otherwise can end up causing weight gain. Various diet plans are summarized below to help you learn to review them for safety and effectiveness.\n\nhow to lose weight fast\nhow to lose weight\nweight loss\nlose weight\nlose weight fast\nweight loss pills\nweight loss calculator\nweight loss tips\nbest way to lose weight\nweight loss programs\nfastest way to lose weight\nbest weight loss pills\nextreme weight loss\nquick weight loss\nbefore and after weight loss\nweight loss supplements\nweight loss blogs\nweight loss surgery\nfast weight loss\nrachel ray weight loss\nweight loss shakes\nweight loss plans\nmedical weight loss\njuicing for weight loss\nmedi weight loss\nrapid weight loss\nweight loss foods\nweight loss blog\nweight loss diet", "title": "DIET JOURNAL - Online Diet Journal - Diet Journal Tips", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T16:35:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6UdAQvVH9z8", "description": "Access and Knowledge [www.metlife.org] is the first of three pillars that define the Foundation\u2019s philanthropic strategy.

It stars 30 year old filmmaker Paul Rosolie, who is a cross between Steve Irwin and Bear Grylls with a pinch of Johnny Knoxville thrown in.

By volume, it is the largest known living single stem tree on earth. The General Sherman Tree is neither the tallest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to the Hyperion tree, a Coast redwood), nor is it the widest (both the largest cypress and largest baobab have a greater diameter), nor is it the oldest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to a Great Basin bristlecone pine). With a height of 83.8 metres (275\u00a0ft), a diameter of 7.7 metres (25\u00a0ft), an estimated bole volume of 1,487 cubic metres (52,513\u00a0cu\u00a0ft), and an estimated age of 2,300\u20132,700 years, it is nevertheless among the tallest, widest and longest-lived of all trees on the planet.\nWhile the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the largest tree known to humans. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) near Trinidad, California, is estimated to have been 15 to 25% larger than the General Sherman tree by volume. The tree was cut down in the mid-1940s.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "General Sherman (tree)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-27T00:49:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Uqlq_THV5k", "description": "Track taken from the S/T 7\" on Urgent Warning Records.\n\nwww.urgentwarningrecords.com", "title": "Vermin - Maximum Correction", "publishedDate": "2014-03-08T20:02:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Uqr3xKIYFU", "description": "Product demonstration DKNY Ladies' Jitney Ceramic Watch (NY2142).

The curb chain is engaged at this point restricting further rotation and simultaneously the mouthpiece rotates forwards and comes to rest vertically within the mouth. It does not roll forwards onto the tongue.\n\nA mild ergonomically designed Weymouth. The gently sloping mouthpiece forms a wide, low tongue bridge designed for maximum comfort across the tongue and gentle, even weight distribution over the bars. The mouthpiece is a constant 16mm diameter, circular over the bars and cleverly changing shape forming an oval profile over the tongue, thereby occupying minimum volume between the tongue and upper palate. A very kind, gentle mouthpiece designed specifically for maximum comfort and clear communication.\n\nIt is beneficial for horses that have a 'short smile' (small distance from the corner of the lip to the muzzle), as it will sit further back in the mouth. This leaves more room for the bridoon (snaffle part of the double). The comfort factor will discourage over-activity and tongue evasions and it is also physically harder for the horse to draw the tongue back and get it over the mouthpiece as there is usually insufficient room to achieve this. This revolutionary design has eradicated many long term tongue evasions, and often horses that were previously considered un-bittable in doubles are now happy and going extremely well.", "title": "44 - The Neue Schule Pacifier Weymouth Horse Bit", "publishedDate": "2012-03-07T11:18:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6V-kLv3qnxA", "description": "Polk County adopted an ordinance which provides universal garbage collection.

the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "H@t Woman & Girl Are Watching Flower Show", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T16:20:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VGlXOOwIj8", "description": "Esmeralda by Naiknavare Developers Pvt.

I'm Mike Patrick, and today I'm going to teach you how to throw playing cards.  The grip I use most often is, I use two grips.  One of which is like this.  I use these two fingers, the index and middle finger, and it clips the outer right hand corner, and the lower right hand corner touches the palm of your hand.  And it's not like a throwing action, it's mostly wrist.  \n\nSo when you first do this you should use just your wrist to get used to tossing cards like this.  You'll get a little bit more accurate over time, but use mostly your wrist at first.  When you get good at that you can use your whole arm, and you can throw much further and much harder.  \n\nThe other grip that I use, and this one I think I get a little bit more accuracy with this grip.  So what I do is I clip the outer left hand corner of this and this corner goes into the hand, so now the card is held more in a parallel action.  Do the exact same kind of action, a tossing straight forward and you should be able to get a lot of distance with just the throwing action.  Again, I can't stress this enough, use just your wrist when you start.  Don't use your arm.  Once you get comfortable with your wrist and once you get relatively accurate, throw a few decks of cards have a little basket, it's easier to pick them up out of, once you get used to that you can throw cards very rapidly and terrorize your friends.  \n\nThat's how to throw a deck of cards or individual cards.  I'm Mike Patrick and don't take out too many eyes.", "title": "How to Throw Cards | Magic Card Flourishes", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T16:28:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VTTPXSd_b0", "description": "Microscopic Crystals in Aroid Flowers: A Role in Gamete Protection?\n\nMany plants have idioblast cells which produce crystals of calcium oxalate. Crystal idioblasts are well known in the vegetative tissues of species in the Araceae. Many aroid species have a type of crystal idioblast, termed the biforine, which is able to forcibly expel the crystals. It has often been proposed that these crystals, particularly those in biforines, might play a role in defending against herbivory. If this is true we would hypothesize that crystals would be abundant in reproductive tissues, arrayed so as to protect the pollen and ovules without interfering with pollinators. To test this, we examined floral tissues from 21 aroid species in 12 tribes, collected from greenhouse material and from the wild in Connecticut and Virginia (USA) and French Guiana. These species represented a variety of pollination strategies, including bribing pollinators with edible sterile flowers (staminodia). Tepals, in those species which had them, always contained crystals. Crystals were common in gynoecial walls, but generally absent from the ovules themselves. Crystals were found the connectives and filaments of stamens, particularly in those species where stamens fuse into synandria. Dense strands of biforine-like cells were seen in synandria. However, crystals were rare to absent in anthers, except that species of Caladieae and Dieffenbachieae contain prismatic crystals among the pollen. The results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that aroids deploy crystals to protect gametes. Unexpectedly, however, staminodia were often well endowed with crystals, and there was evidence that the crystals could limit staminodia consumption in some species. This suggests a more complex role for crystals in these organs.", "title": "Gary Cot\u00e9 - Botany 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-08-10T02:50:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VTh-bDbbJw", "description": "Este v\ufffddeo se ha subido desde un tel\ufffdfono con Android.", "title": "Miasis en jm casal ramos", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T16:57:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VTxYRnoeNA", "description": "The Chocolate Cake Queen lives in a kingdom called En-usha.

Three subspecies are recognized \u2014 Elephas maximus maximus from Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant or E. m. indicus from mainland Asia, and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra. Asian elephants are the largest living land animals in Asia.Since 1986, E. maximus has been listed as endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 50% over the last three generations, estimated to be 60--75 years. The species is pre-eminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. In 2003, the wild population was estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in seminatural situations, such as forest camps. In zoos, elephants die at a much younger age and are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.The genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene ranging throughout Africa into southern Asia.The earliest indications of domestication of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley civilization dated as third millennium BC.\nIn general, the Asian elephant is smaller than the African elephant and has the highest body point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally. The distinctive trunk is an elongation of the nose and upper lip combined; the nostrils are at its tip, which has a one finger-like process. The trunk contains as many as 60,000 muscles, which consist of longitudinal and radiating sets. The longitudinals are mostly superficial and subdivided into anterior, lateral and posterior. The deeper muscles are best seen as numerous distinct fasciculi in a cross-section of the trunk. The trunk is a multipurpose prehensile organ and highly sensitive, innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve and by the facial nerve. The acute sense of smell uses both the trunk and Jacobson's organ. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, watering, feeding, touching, dusting, sound production and communication, washing, pinching, grasping, defense and offense.The trunk can hold about four litres of water. Elephants will playfully wrestle with each other using their trunks, but generally use their trunks only for gesturing when fighting. the trunk  the ability to hold, and manipulate loads of up to 300 kg (660 lb). Muscular and tendinous ability combined with nervous control allows extraordinary strength and agility movements of the trunk, such as sucking and spraying of water or dust and directed air flow blowing. Tusks serve to dig for water, salt, and rocks, to debark trees, as levers for maneuvering fallen trees and branches, for work, for display, for marking trees, as weapon for offense and defense, as trunk-rests, as protection for the trunk. They are known to be right or left tusked. Skin color is usually gray, and may be masked by soil because of dusting and wallowing. Their wrinkled skin is movable and contains many nerve centers. It is smoother than of African elephants, and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears, or neck. The epidermis and dermis of the body average 18 mm (0.71 in) thick; skin on the dorsum is 30 mm (1.2 in) thick providing protection against bites, bumps, and adverse weather. Asian elephants are highly intelligent and self-aware. They have a very large and highly convoluted neo-cortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species. Asian elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing of all existing land animals. Asian elephants inhabit grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Elephants are crepuscular.They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg of plant matter per day. They are generalist feeders, and both grazers and browsers, and were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, and the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families.Adult females and calves may move about together as groups, but adult males disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence. Bull elephants may be solitary or form temporary 'bachelor groups'.Bulls will fight one another to get access to estrous females. Strong fights over access to females are extremely rare. Bulls reach sexual maturity around the age of 12--15. Between the age of 10 and 20 years, bulls undergo an annual phenomenon known as \"musth\". This is a period where the testosterone level is up to 100 times greater than nonmusth periods, and they become extremely aggressive. The first historical record of the domestication of Asian elephants was in Harappan times.", "title": "Asian Or Asiatic Elephant (Elephas maximus) Hatti, of Kanha national Park by Shirishkumar", "publishedDate": "2013-06-01T10:33:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VXSCBV6S2c", "description": "http://howtogetniceskin.com/best-moisturizer-face/ - Best Collagen Face Cream - Questioning how to increase collagen within the  face so you may both reduce the wrinkles and fine lines which have already formed or just keep them away in the future? This article will give you a few top notch tips of finding an anti-aging solution that will just do this.\n\nIf you are already looking for a skin care treatment to increase the amount of collagen protein in your face, then you probably already know how important of a job collagen actually plays in figuring out your skin's overall structure. There is just no denying the indisputable fact that the more of this protein that is in your skin, the less wrinkles you'll need and the firmer it will be.\n\nBut what is no longer so clear is the actual technique that works best at increasing collagen within the  face. There are TONS of different recommendations available on the market at present, and even worse they all declare to be effective whilst maximum are in actual fact no longer.\n\nThe fact Approximately How to increase Collagen In the Face:\n\nUp till recently, the only type of skin care treatment that was accessible having to do with increasing collagen levels in the skin have been ones that actually contain the protein as a precise aspect. At the time (and sadly even to this day), these form of treatments have been through of by clients as the subsequent 'miracle treatment'. I imply, they certain sound like a good way of accelerating collagen in the face, right?\n\nBest Collagen Face Cream:\nhttp://howtogetniceskin.com/best-moisturizer-face/\nWRONG!\n\nTrust it or no longer, molecules of collagen are not able to be absorbed by the skin. Your skin's pores are only to small for those proteins to actually fit through them This is obviously something that almost all skin care firms 'forgot' to tell us clients. If that's not an example of unethical business practice, then I don't know what is!\n\nWithout a doubt, the best way to enhance collagen in the face is by using recommendations with ingredients that stimulate it's construction NATURALLY contained in the skin. By way of creating extra of your personal proteins with their own unique makeup, they will be able to form strong bonds with other proteins and ultimately make your skin more firm and elastic.\n\nIf you ask me, there is just one single aspect that's worth looking for in an anti-aging treatment that stimulates collagen construction NATURALLY, and that ingredient is CynergyTK&#153;. Since it's patented form of keratin that's in a form that's perfect by the skin, it is able to help increase the construction of collagen in your skin closer to levels at that is use to once you were a lot younger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncelebrity stretch marks solution\ngetting rid of stretch marks at home\ngirls with stretch marks and guranteed solution\nhow can stretch marks go away\nhow can you lose stretch marks\nhow do stretch marks go away\nhow do you make scars go away\nhow to get rid of thigh stretch marks\nhow to lose stretch marks\nhow to remove stretch marks on back\nI Have Stretch Marks Everywhere\nlose weight stretch marks\nno stretch marks\nred stretch marks\nremedies to get rid of stretch marks\nSkinception Cream Reviews\nstretch marks fading\nstretch marks from lifting\nstretch marks on arms\nstretch marks on breasts\nstretch marks on legs\nstretch marks on thighs\ntop stretch mark removal creams\nwhat can help stretch marks\nwhat can i do about my stretch marks\nwhat causes stretch marks\nwhite stretch marks\nwill stretch marks go away\nBest Collagen Face Cream: http://howtogetniceskin.com/best-moisturizer-face/", "title": "Best Collagen Face Cream - 100% Results", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T10:22:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VXdck0IHJI", "description": "Terra da Padroeira: aos domingos, \u00e0s 9h, na Rede Aparecida\n\nREDE APARECIDA \nA TV de Nossa Senhora \nhttp://www.a12.com/tv \nhttp://www.twitter.com/tvaparecida \nhttp://www.facebook.com/aparecidatv", "title": "Terra da Padroeira | Bruna Viola - Saco de Ouro - 20 de Abril de 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T14:08:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VXm3TPDn9Y", "description": "Betsy Salkind's famous Squirrel Impression", "title": "Betsy Salkind: Squirrel", "publishedDate": "2011-08-04T18:53:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VXpMqEp3kc", "description": "Song by Poplar.\nJapanese title:\u308f\u3093\u3071\u304f\u30c0\u30c3\u30af\u5922\u5192\u967a / Wanpaku Duck Yume Bouken\n\nLyrics:\nKiraku ni tsuppashire i tsu de mo.\nKoketara nekorobeba ii jya na i.\nTsumazuita nazonazo sa DuckTales.\nRakuchin atama de DuckTales.\nMuri shicya dame dayo DuckTales.\nCyo cyo cyo cyotto!

It took about 2-3 weeks for the graft to take hold resulting in an overall growth setback. I'll try again only earlier this year. I'm starting tomato and potato seedlings indoors to get a jump start on the growing season, that way by the time spring kicks in, the grafts will have already set in a protected environment. \n-This experiment proved to me that grafting the tomato to potato works and if you learn from my mistakes the effort might be work you time!

He shows how the cartilage is carved and how the individual layers are sutured together.

Today I'm going to show you how to make an Asian rhinoplasty dorsal augmentation graft using cartilage. In this specific case we're going to be using a mix of both septal cartilage and ear cartilage from a patient. Here I am measuring the length of each cartilage graft. This is based off of the length of the bridge of the patient that needs to be augmented. Here I am trimming the harvested ear cartilage from the patient that I had harvested earlier in the case. One of the benefits of using a patient's own cartilage is that the graft can be fully customized based off of the actual width that is needed and also the length. There is also the benefit, of course, of using your own tissue. There is a much lower risk of rejection or infection down the road. \n\nNow that I have two layers of cartilage based off of the septum and ear cartilage I'll now layer or laminate them. They are actually connected using sutures. In this case I'll be using a mixture of both dissolvable, or resorbable, sutures and also permanent sutures. This is mainly in areas that I want to ensure that cartilage does not want to buckle, especially given the natural shape of the cartilage in that area. With time each layer of cartilage will actually scar to each other. This is typically done after several months. The sutures are mainly to ensure that there aren't any changes during the healing process. The actual thickness of the graft is also dependent on the needs of the patient and their desires. Some patients only need one layer of cartilage if they only need minimal augmentation whereas other patients may need more than one, up to two or three. This patient will actually have a three layer graft ultimately using one layer of septal cartilage and two layers using the ear cartilage. \n\nYou may have noticed that there is actually additional septal cartilage that we could have used. You may be wondering why I'm not using it for the bridge. The main reason is that I'm actually performing other maneuvers during this rhinoplasty on the tip of the nose in which I require the strong, straight cartilage of the septum. Ear cartilage isn't typically as strong as septal cartilage and has a natural curvature of the conchal bowl. This can be used on the dorsum regardless. You can now see the graft coming together, looking nice and straight. Once we're done suturing the layers together we'll then be able to bevel and trim the edges so that there are no sharp edges. This is what we're doing now with our scalpel. As you can imagine the top of the bridge typically has a gentle curve rather than a sharp edge. We want to make sure this is continued with the graft. Now that we have made the graft and it is fully in place we'll now insert it in the bridge pocket to make sure that it gives us the precise level of augmentation that we desire.\n \nrhinoplastyinseattle.com\"\n\nDr. Thomas Lamperti is certified by both the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the American Board of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck surgery.

When one becomes fairly sure of what to expect from the city, many unexpected pleasant surprises await just around the corner.

It is an attempt to capture the soul of the city.\nIt is an experiential film, made in a natural unchoreographed format, with very real-life experiences.

This was a very impressive hands on approach to exhibiting new tools. JOB WELL DONE! \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_coating\nPowder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main difference between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a \"skin\". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminium extrusions, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be powder coated using different methods.", "title": "2012 SEMA Wagner System powder coating demo and presentation", "publishedDate": "2012-11-10T22:48:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VsmmE5zqhI", "description": "Two way switch wiring diagram.", "title": "Two way switching diagram.Two way switch.", "publishedDate": "2013-12-27T18:50:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Vspf1dEnuo", "description": "Handstand press training @ Lorimer Park - tuck planche to press\n\n\nhttp://viddy.it/XW3UrY", "title": "Lorimer Nights", "publishedDate": "2013-02-26T05:12:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VtX3jhbUtE", "description": "Follow me: twitter.com/matiakamanager \nGet free apps the real way - http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/4fef7647 \n\nVery easy instructional video showing you how to create a iTunes account without a credit card. \nSteps:\n1.

The Cam Sync is basically half of a distributor, and was the result of Ford's inability to correctly re-design engines to facilitate new technology, in this case their new Coil per plug setup that took the place of the Distributor. Along with this lack of a re-design comes the lack of sufficient oil flow to the bearings inside of the camshaft synchronizer, and over time, the bearings turn dry and begin to chirp. If left ignored, and if the conditions line up correctly, there is a chance of your cam sync shaft wobbling and eventually lifting up into the Camshaft Position Sensor. If this happens, and you're very unlucky, the vane of the cam sync shaft will become entangled in the CPS or the Cam Sync housing, and the shaft will abruptly stop. This sudden stop often shears the cam gear at the bottom of the shaft. Furthermore, the Cam Sync shaft is also responsible for turning the oil pump shaft, and if the cam sync shaft stops turning, so does the oil pump shaft, and you will lose all oil pressure. \n\nMy truck started chirping one day on the way to work, and being a Ranger guy and knowing all too well the dangers of running the truck with a chirping cam sync, I immediately went to Ford and bought a new Cam Sync. \n\nThis video demonstrates the chirping sound that the Camshaft Synchronizer often exhibits.", "title": "Ford Camshaft Synchronizer Chirp", "publishedDate": "2012-01-14T03:40:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VziVhEac8E", "description": "www.WALACAMTV.COM", "title": "FEE FEE vs HONEY DIP - QUEEN OF BOB CONTEST JUKE ( WALA CAM ) DA WAR ZONE", "publishedDate": "2011-04-11T01:22:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VzjiYTxQms", "description": "Band: Gomorrah\nCountry: UK\nAlbum: Reflections Of Inanimate Matter\nYear: 1994\nGenre: Death/Thrash Metal", "title": "Gomorrah - Rejoice In Flames", "publishedDate": "2011-04-16T09:35:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Vzo9gLAGnA", "description": "you will not stop laughing after watching this", "title": "Hardest Millionaire Question[FUNNY]", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T09:42:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6VzzlUgE9pI", "description": "Download\n\nPart 1 - http://www.mediafire.com/?dttsgiq4td8k333\nPart 2 - http://www.mediafire.com/?xyacoudadkwbnj4\nPart 3 - http://www.mediafire.com/?3axmd71oaxg0tyy", "title": "Atelier Rorona ~Alchemist of Arland~ OST Disc 1 Track 30 - Unpleasant Presentiment", "publishedDate": "2012-04-28T14:39:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6W-7FG9KlpA", "description": "Electron Transport System and ATP Synthesis\nSource: mcgraw hill animations\nhttp://microbiologyworld.com/", "title": "Electron Transport System and ATP Synthesis", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T16:23:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6W-7LBHuG9M", "description": "N\u00f3s, da banda Skein de Campos dos Goytacazes - RJ, gravamos esse v\u00eddeo do nosso show no Rock in the Pool 2014.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Eczema - What Is It, What Causes It, and How to Treat It", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T09:45:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6W6BeMq6U8A", "description": "One Rifle. Many Missions. The revolutionary, fully-modular Remington Adaptive Combat Rifle (ACR). The ACR was initially conceived to provide today's warfighter an American-made, reliable, accurate, and mission --configurable rifle. Three American companies -- MagPul Industries Corp., Bushmaster and Remington -- shared this common vision and after multiple iterations of torturous testing only the strongest materials, components and concepts survived. The ACR can change calibers from 5.56mm to 6.8mm in minutes at the user level by changing the bolt head, barrel, and magazine. The ACR can also change barrels, stocks, and accessories to go from a close-quarters battle carbine to a designated marksman rifle. Add a superbly reliable gas piston operating system, controllable full-auto fire capability, a non-reciprocating bolt handle, a monolithic free-floating handguard rail system, and intuitive, ambidextrous controls and you have a platform that is a natural fit for any operator and gives him all the options he needs.

The question I want to answer ... is it worth buying the iPod nano for this feature without buying the Nike running add ons?   The answer I came to is Yes, it is worth buying without spending the extra money on the Nike running shoe pod and iPod accessory.  \n\nI went running yesterday, 29k in total but for part of my run I set my watch (Polar) and my Nano iPod Pedometer to start at the same time.  I ran around a park with a known distance of 3k.  The outcome you will see in this video.   Walking the pedometer I would expect to have more steps.  \n\nWhen beginning to walk/jog from nothing then it is important about the TIME you spend doing the exercise NOT the distance you cover.  Even marathon runners will tell you,  for training it's about time on the road not distance covered on the road although at the end of the day you do need to know your distance is growing for a given intensity. \n\nSo yes, treat yourself to the Nano iPod, it's well worth the money and throw away those arm bands that end up wearing out.  You will also find out (if you chose to buy the Nike gear) that the shoe pod battery wears out (more expense) and you need access to the Internet to view the Nike runners information... that is why I gave up using Nike for my running.", "title": "Pedometer Apple iPod Nano More detail for getting fit and for runners", "publishedDate": "2011-05-22T04:58:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6W7IgNYI2ZE", "description": "There are some nuances to posterior fossa surgery that are important. A careful, blood-less dural opening is always ideal.  Protecting the floor of the fourth ventricle ( aka the brainstem!) is crucial.

Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes Tomistoma, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.\n\nAlthough they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial having a narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into. Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family that the species belongs to. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.\n\nCrocodile size, morphology, behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.", "title": "Crocodile Crocodylinae True crocodiles Crocodylus niloticus", "publishedDate": "2014-10-25T14:27:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WFSh6kjlGY", "description": "Baixe o CD COMPLETO PELO LINK \u2193\u2193\u2193\nhttp://www.suamusica.com.br/#!/ShowDetalhes.php?id=434329&neto-lx--\u00e9-muita-lux\u00faria--m\u00fasicas-novas-tops-ex-banda-lux\u00faria.html", "title": "Neto LX - A Carne Do Momento - \u00c9 Muita Lux\u00faria - Novas 2015", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T19:31:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WFzjCmZXyI", "description": "This is my first lyric video, so sorry if it's a bit behind, or too fast. :3\n\nHope you enjoyed it thou! :D\n\nI DO NOT OWN ANY CONTENT FROM THE SONG OR BAND.

Which I would like to take this opportunity to thank Tori, Andrew, and Tori's team for giving dance and choreography such a presence in only her second official music video which is a risky enough thing to do even if you are top 40 established artist. This just goes on to inspire me as an artist as it should all of you that TRUE ART IS NOT DEAD. There are people out there who respect us as dancers and our craft you just have to find them-so on behalf of dancers everywhere thank you again Andrew, Tori's team and especially Tori for believing in not only me but our craft as dancers to hold up for the majority of her video.\n\nDown to the reason why I did this video\u2014 When I first choreographed this piece, I was going through exactly what this song expresses so it was very easy for me to choreograph but I actually wrote and created the story line you see in this video before I even choreographed one move...I had absolutely no idea at the time that Tori would ever be interested in using my choreography for more than anything besides maybe retweeting my video whenever I dropped it...so it was pretty awesome that I got the opportunity I did but as an artist I also felt that I still needed to get out exactly what I saw in my head when I choreographed this piece in order to feel complete-I absolutely adore the story Tori and Andrew created for the video but as you can imagine I choreographed the story from MY point of view, the man, being the heartbroken...missing something. I almost ended up not doing this video but in the end I thought it would be cool to show the world how one piece of artwork like this song, can inspire creation on so many levels by many different people- so I guess this is kind of an \"alternate reality\" of Tori's true masterpiece \"Paper Hearts\"...the man's perspective...a sappy man's perspective haha...hey I can't help it! Love you all, thank you so much-something very different coming up for my next dance video so don't worry if this is too soft for some of you guys haha. \n\nLove.\n\nand thank you to Carlena for rollin through last minute (we are actually talking smack to each other in every scene hahah funny what music can do)!", "title": "Ian Eastwood | @Ian_Eastwood Choreography | @Torikelly -\"Paper Hearts\" | Tori Kelly", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T01:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WPqYklwn30", "description": "Jin                   Turquoise \nSuga               Yellow \nJ-Hope            Purple \nRap Monster   Red\nJimin               Green \nV                     Blue\nJungkook        Orange", "title": "Bangtan boys (BTS) Spine Breaker color coded lyrics [ ENG ROM HAN ]", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T06:09:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WPrJI4LnhI", "description": "Clinical case used during our US training.\n\n80 years old, Intestinal bowel obstruction.

He thinks that people will only care for this issue as long as the media puts information about it in front of them.  Jack stated that people easily lose interest in fighting for change these days, as opposed to decades prior, once the particular subject stops being mentioned on various media platforms.  \nThe fact that nobody's monetary status is directly affected by these types of social injustice situations is also one major reason that people lose interest, according to Jack.

Single malts come from one area, single process, and then put directly into the barrel. Blended malts will take different expressions of different whiskeys made in different areas and blend them together to get a consist or unique taste. \n\nSingle malts can be made anywhere, not just in Scotland, although most people think of Scotland when they think of single malt whiskey. It's something that really expresses the Teruya, the local flavor and character of where the crops are grown and the process by which you distill them. \n\nYou can make single malt whiskey anywhere. There are American single malts, there are Japanese single malts, there are Indian single malts. The difference between the two is a question of the grower's art and the distiller's art. The single malt is going to reflect the place where it's grown, the method by which it's produced, whether it's put in a column still or an Olympic copper still, whereas a blended whiskey happens after everything has been made, after everything has been distilled. \n\nIt is then blended to taste and can be aged afterwards. This whiskey, the Hibiki twelve year blended, is blended from a variety of different Japanese single malts and then is put into barrels for twelve years to sort of marry and intermingle. Whereas this single malt, from upstate, is grown in the Hudson Valley, distilled there. It expresses notes of smoke, stone and earth, whereas the Hibiki is a lot lighter, softer, a little more floral, reflecting the different barley's that it is grown from in Japan. \n\nIn essence, the difference between single malt and blended is manufacturing technique. They're both aged, one's as good as the other depending on the quality of the ingredients that go into it. But really when you're talking about single malt and blended, you're talking about barley whiskeys, scotches, things like that. That's a quick rundown of blended  versus single malt. \n\n[music]", "title": "What Is Single-Blended Malt Whiskey? | Whiskey Guide", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T05:04:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WbXJY7DvRw", "description": "Leading the industry with a one-year battery life and superior image clarity, Bushnell has enhanced its 2012 product line with a host of new features including high definition (HD) video, 0.6 second trigger speed, improved Field Scan 2x time lapse technology and hyper night vision.

A bonus was the setting of St Peter and St Paul church, a lovely, historic church in which to hear a rich selection of 16th and 17th century choral music, canzonas and dances by great composers of the Renaissance and Early Baroque period. Add the sympathetic acoustic of the church and the result was a wholly-satisfying evening.\n\nFrom the very first Alleluja of the opening Plaudite Omnis Terra by Gabrieli, the quality of sound was apparent as the choir sang of making a joyful noise unto God...\n\nNisi Dominus from Vespers of 1610 by Monteverdi for two choirs followed, briskly sung as a proclamation of strongly held faith, with a beautifully sustained Amen at the end.\n\nIntermingled with the singing, sometimes performing on their own and at other times accompanying, were The Six, who turned out to comprise two cornetts and two sackbuts played with authority by David Jarratt-Knock and Wayne Plummer and Jack Smith and David Todd respectively.\n\nAs composers of the period often wrote music for either singing or playing this added an authentic touch to the concert and some madrigals varied the mood.\n\nConductor John Holloway invariably chooses interestingly compiled programmes and this was no exception.\n\nJohn Taverner became an agent for Thomas Cromwell's brutal suppression of the monasteries yet composed some marvellous music such as the plainsong Dum Transisset Sabbatum which in this setting was most moving. Further plainsong followed with the male singers highlighted in Tallis's Loquebantur Variis Linguis.\n\nIn contrast was the German Schutz's Meine Seele Erhebt den Herrn (Magnificat). The four instrumentalists and John Wright on a portable organ joined the choir in Hodie Completi Sunt by Gabrieli, a devout proclamation of faith.

From the basics you move from your basics to your additives. You will need Sea Cal which is Humbot Nutrient's calcium additive. It helps with the vegetative growth and makes sure your cell wall structures are solid and promotes good overall growth. Next is Sea Mag which is more for your bloom stage. After that you can add Ginormous. Ginormous is a bloom enhancer that contains high amounts of phosphorus. Next we have a potassium supplement. This may differ if you are in soil or hydroponics. In a hydroponic application you have a product called HydroDeuce. In a soil application we have a product called Deuce Deuce. For a basic rule of thumb, even in a soil application, you may want to use HydroDeuce. The HydroDeuce is going to be more lucid and flow past through your plants better. Prozyme is a beneficial  enzyme concentrate. Prozyme is going to break down unwanted salt and mineral deposits in your plants. Its basically cleaning your plant while helping your plant feed better. There are a few soluble parts in your basic system. The first is Big Up powder. Its used in your first week of bloom and last two weeks of bloom. This also helps induce flower sites, ease the tradition between veg and bloom, and in the last 2 weeks its used to bring your plants to their fullest potential. The next product you're going to use is White Widow. White Widow contains beneficial microres bacteria and will help your root structure uptake nutrients. FlavorFul us a humid acid derivative and will naturally bring out the flavor of your product. Humbolt Honey, wether you use the ES Natural of the Hydrocarbs, is your carbohydrate supplement. Natural sugars and carbohydrates are essential when doing any flowering. The carbs and sugars of this product will enhance the flavors of your fruits, vegetables or flowers. Here we have Humbolt Sticky. This is one of the premium wetting agents on the market and product here at the Grow Show. Wetting agents are essential if you doing any type of foliar application. Humbolt Sticky, when used with foliar feeder, will help to actually infuse the nutrients into the plant's cell walls and let the plant uptake the nutrients. If you don't use sticky, your foliar feed will most likely just bead up and roll off the leaves. The last in the line is Royal Flush. Before harvesting your plant, you are going to want to rid it of all the nutrients and salts it has built up by using the products in a feeding chart. Royal Flush is specially designed to work with the other Humbolt products to get a complete and effective cleanse of your plant. We would like to thank Roy Gomez for our line of Humboldt nutrients at the Grow Show, here in Ann Arbor.

So when you are re-basting on the grill or when you are leaning over your oven you don't have to get to close, you can easily reach, so you don't burn your self -- which is awesome.\n\nThe silicone bristles I discovered really grip the sauce so I can baste it over the roast that I'm cooking tonight.  So I absolutely recommend this cooking and barbecue tool.  It's a lot of fun to use and I just love the bristles.\n\nA great thing about this basting brush is it actually came with a bonus silicone wrap, which I'm so excited about.  It's so eco friendly.  What you do is stretch it across the top of the bowl and it grips.  It makes an air-tight seal for your left overs.  How cool is that?.  \n\nAnyway this is going to be so much fun in my kitchen.  Thanks so much Flameria for producing such an outstanding basting brush.\n\nHere's a short summary of the features of the Flameria new silicone kitchen and BBQ basting tool:\n\n1. perfect for all indoor and outdoor barbecue and grill basting\n2. temperature resistant to 450 degrees F, food-grade red silicone bristles\n3. super easy to clean, and dishwasher safe\n4. stainless-steel 12-inch long handle\n5. hanging ring for easy storage\n6. bonus silicone wrap and a one year no-hassle guarantee \n\nFor further info on the Flameria Basting Brush go to http://www.flameriabastingbrush.com", "title": "Basting Brush from Flameria - Video Review", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T17:20:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WvBcPJoCYQ", "description": "haploid 23 performs selections from their self-titled debut at Arizona State University on December 7, 2008.", "title": "childhood safety planet - haploid 23", "publishedDate": "2008-12-15T06:05:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6WvQGN3Uphk", "description": "Official music video for Ivan Ooze - up and coming emcee from Melbourne, Victoria.\n\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ivanuzi\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mcivanooze\n\nhttp://www.gangeproductions.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/GangeProductions", "title": "Ivan Ooze - Lights Out Ft.

These muscles tend to get overworked and fatigued pretty easily. Often they are the sites of painful trigger points. This video will show you some ways to stretch these muscles.\n\nFor the first stretch, bring your arm straight across your body. With your other arm, bend it at the elbow, and place it on the elbow to be stretched. It will look almost like a figure four. Hold it for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times.\n\nNext, bring both arms straight out in front of you. Clasp your hands together, and punch forward. Tuck in your chin and arch your back as well. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times. Now with your legs straight out in front of you, cross over the opposite leg of the arm you want to stretch. Twist your trunk toward the leg, and place the elbow of the arm that you want to stretch on the opposite knee. Push forward with your elbow, and hold for 30 seconds repeating 3 times.\n\nFinally, get on all fours or in quadruped. Cross your hands, and then arch your back like a cat. Hold this for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and any related comments are not medical advice.

At the time, officials in the country announced that they were considering a ban on plastic bags to curb environmental damage. Mupuya, who was still in secondary school, immediately saw this as an opportunity to launch a paper bag production company.\n\n\"I conducted a feasibility study, market research around retail shops, kiosks, supermarkets around Kampala and discovered there is need and potential market for paper bags.\"\n\nTo start out his small operation, Mupuya figured out he needed a capital of 36,000 Ugandan shillings ($14). He raised the first $11 from selling 70 kilos of used plastic bottles he'd collected over one week. Mupuya then borrowed the remaining $3 from his school teacher and embarked on his entrepreneurial journey producing paper bags on a small scale.\n\n\nSince then, the business has grown extensively and today, at the age of 21, Mupuya is the owner of Youth Entrepreneurial Link Investments (YELI), the first registered Ugandan company to make paper bags.\n\n\nThe young entrepreneur employs 16 people who produce up to 20,000 paper bags each week. His long list of clients includes restaurants, retail stores, supermarkets, medical centers, as well as multinational companies like Samsung -- YELI has made about 1,000 niche bags for the local stores of the electronics company.\u200e\n\n\"Right now I have 72 clients,\" says Mupuya. \"Ninety per cent of our clients always come back.\"\n\nGreen impact\n\n\nMupuya's remarkable achievements and shrewd business skills have been recognized with a number of accolades in recent years. In 2012, Mupuya was the winner of the $30,000 Anzisha Prize, a major award given to young African entrepreneurial leaders who take the initiative to address critical needs in their communities.\n\n\"The awards I have won give me courage to push on with my business,\" says the young entrepreneur.\n\n\n\"It shows to me how I am doing the right thing and it helps me define the impact am creating.\"\n\n\nDARK MATTER PARADIGM | http://www.darkmatterparadigm.blogspot.com\n\nThe mystery and history of the first peoples - The Indigenous, Original Moors.

Neben dem Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen und dessen zahlreichen Unterarten gibt es noch weitere, in den Gebirgen wachsende Arten. Die Stiefm\u00fctterchen geh\u00f6ren zusammen mit den Veilchen in die gleiche Gattung. Stiefm\u00fctterchen und Veilchen sind sehr nahe verwandt, sie unterscheiden sich im wesentlichen nur dadurch, dass die seitlichen Bl\u00fctenbl\u00e4tter beim Stiefm\u00fctterchen aufw\u00e4rts und nicht wie beim Veilchen seit- bzw. abw\u00e4rts gerichtet sind. Das Sammeln und Trocknen der Stiefm\u00fctterchen ist etwas heikel, es sollte rasch geschehen, um ein Reifwerden der Bl\u00fcten und Kapseln zu vermeiden. Die getrockneten Bl\u00fcten der Stiefm\u00fctterchen bewahren ihre Farbe nur wenn man sie luftdicht aufbewahrt. Bereits seit einigen Jahrhunderten wird ein Aufguss mit Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen innerlich gegen Hautausschlag, Geschw\u00fcre und Milchschorf oder auch \u00e4u\u00dferlich in Form von Umschl\u00e4gen angewandt. Der Tee aus diesen Heilpflanzen wirkt au\u00dferdem harntreibend und blutreinigend, auch hat er eine positive Wirkung bei der Behandlung von Rheumatismus.\n\nJe nach Standort wird das einj\u00e4hrige Stiefm\u00fctterchen 10 bis 30 cm hoch. Die eif\u00f6rmig bis lanzettlich geformten Bl\u00e4tter sind gestielt und gekerbt. Sie wachsen zusammen mit mit gro\u00dfen, fiederteiligen Nebenbl\u00e4ttern. Die Bl\u00fctezeit der Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen beginnt im April und endet im Oktober. Die wei\u00dfen, gelben, violetten oder oftmals gemischt gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fcten sind lang gestielt, mit je 5 ungleichen Kelch- und Kronbl\u00e4ttern. Das unterste Kronblatt ist  gespornt. Der Geschmack der Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen ist bitter und etwas salzig.\nStandort / Hier findet man die Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen\n\nDie Wilden Stiefm\u00fctterchen wachsen im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Die Pflanze bevorzugt Felder, Feldr\u00e4nder und Wegr\u00e4nder.

Nawabs and courtiers were bent upon annihilating the Sikhs. The rulers were lustful and tyrannical. Hindus as a class failed to meet the challenge. At the best they could offer compensation to get back the captured girls. . The story depicts incidents and events which inculcate universal brotherhood and love for humanity. A Sikh girl treats an injured Moghul sepoy but on learning that she is a Sikh woman he attacks with his dagger. Surasti, the earlier name of Sundri, was forcibly taken away by the Moghul official and left to the destiny by her own husband and father. . Sundri depicts the story of the Sikh women during those hard times, where they remained steadfast and composed, facing ordeals and hardships but still smiling in the name of the Guru.\nConcept & Inspiration\n\nsubdriBhai Vir Singh a poet, scholar and exegete, is a major figure in the Sikh renaissance and the movement for the revival and renewal of Sikh literary traditions. His identification with all the important concerns of Sikhism was so complete that he came to be honored as Bhai, the Brother of the Sikh Order, very early in his career. \nBhai Vir Singh started as a writer of Sikh romances which proved to be the forerunners of the Punjabi novel.\n\nHis writings in this genre - Sundri (1898), Bijay Singh (1899), Satwant Kaur (published in two parts, I in 1900 and II in 1927)- were aimed at recreating the heroic period (18th century) of Sikh history. Through these novels he made available to his readers typical models of courage, fortitude and human dignity.\n\nSundri the movie\ufffd is the animated adaptation of Sundri: a revolutionary literary masterpiece of Bhai Vir Singh Ji. The Vismaad Team sincerely hopes that this movie continues to inspire the humanity the same way as the novel has been, for more than 100 years.\nProducer's Note\n\nA befitting commemoration of 300 years Gurta Gaddi Diwas of Sri Guru Granth Sahib is to\nabide by Guru Sahibs hukam . . .\nSinghs ought to respect Kaurs.\nKaurs ought to live as true daughters of Guru Gobind Singh ji.\nGender equality may became a genuine practice than a mere rhetoric.\nSundri the movie salutes the great Gursikhs of yore who exemplified living in light of Shabad Guru.\nWe welcome you to the movie discussion forum for latest updates and invite you to post views and suggestions.

I am going to explain a little about the neurology involved. \n\nYou have two areas of your nervous system. You have the stress portion of the nervous system and the resting and digestion portion that slows things down. The resting and digesting portion is called the para sympathetic system. \n\nThe body seeks balance. So, when we have the stress portion of the nervous system we need something to drive the parasympathetic system. Because only one system can operate at one point in time.\n\nSo, as we eat food we excite parasympathetic cranial nerves. Because this resting and digesting system has a lot of nerves that go to our taste buds. As we eat food and taste food it will excite the para sympathetic system reducing stress.  \n\nWhen you add a blood sugar problem to the picture this is where the overeating, especially those foods you are not supposed to eat, really picks up. \n\nIf you can help your blood sugar system and take care of your stress the emotional eating and overeating should start to go away. \n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions, would like more information or need some help overcoming a health challenge. \n\nPlease share our information with as many people as you can.

Hearne picked Fuljenz because he represented the consummate professional that was needed for the novel; a knowledgeable, honest, likable and interestingly unique numismatist. Hearnes knowledge of Fuljenz came from his own experience where he had sought Mike Fuljenzs advice on a collection of Hulagu coins. This was the same type of coin described in the book Hulagus Web.

The virus infects and replicates in immune cells, which further disseminate the virus through the circulation. It eventually dysregulates host immune response, causes coagulation abnormalities and impairs vascular system, which leads to shock and systemic organ failure.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The HCG diet plan uses a unique combination of VLCD (Very Low Calorie Diet) and the hormone HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) to produce a dramatic weight loss in a relatively short time. \n\nThe VLCD means consuming only 500 calories per day. The HCG diet causes the hypothalamus to release the excess fat from the fat deposits in your body such that it is available as energy.  While you are consuming only 500 calories, your hypothalamus is continually releasing the fat stored in your body.

This unusual plumage helped the creature to slow down during flight and land safely, say scientists writing in Nature Communications.\n\nC. yangi is a new species of microraptorine, a group related to early avians.\n\nThese ancient creatures offer clues to the origin of flight - and the transition from feathered dinosaurs to birds.\n\nPalaeontologists once thought that four-winged gliders were a stepping stone in the path to two-winged flight.\n\nBut recent fossil discoveries suggest that microraptorines were an evolutionary side-branch.\n\nFlight probably evolved many times in different feathered species - not only the lineage which ultimately became birds. he skeleton of C. yangi was discovered by a team from Bohai University, China, and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, US.\n\nMeasuring 132cm from its snout to the tip of its tail feathers, it is the largest four-winged dinosaur ever discovered - longer than an eagle or an albatross today.\n\nThe feathers on its hind limbs are unusually prominent - suggesting they were actually \"hindwings\" and played a role in flight, the researchers write.\n\nBy calculating the lift and drag generated by the feathers, they concluded that C. yangi used its long tail to compensate for its large size and maintain control while airborne.\n\n\"The low-aspect-ratio tail of the new fossil would have acted as a pitch control structure reducing descent speed... which could be critical to a safe landing or precise attack on prey,\" the authors write.\n\n\"Such pitch stabilisation could be particularly important for larger microraptorines (since they would tend to fly and/or descend more rapidly than small individuals), and this effect explains why the tail fan is exceptionally long.\" .\n\n\nJOIN QUIZGROUP PARTNER PROGRAM: http://join.quizgroup.com/ .", "title": "Four-Winged Dinosaur is 'Biggest Ever' Has Been Discovered", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T10:32:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6XUP9S9ihPo", "description": "A Good Friday exploration of the Rocky Intertidal area  at Stanley Park on the Burrard Inlet, Vancouver, BC.

In this example, Jen is using the A minor pentatonic scale. Here are two exercises you can do everyday to nail down triplets.\n\nExercise #1 (Counting): Pick a fret on the guitar. Out loud, count \"1...2...3...4...\" at a comfortable tempo. Pick the note on every quarter note beat for one bar, then on the next bar, play eighth note triplets and count those out loud. So, you should be hearing yourself say this on the first bar, \"1...2...3...4...\" and this on the second bar, \"1...2...3...1...2...3...1...2...3...1...2...3\" and continue this back and forth pattern until the rhythm sounds fluid.\n\nExercise #2 (Triplet scales): Play the A minor pentatonic scale (or any preferred scale) up and down the neck in triplet rhythms. Make sure to use a metronome to help you keep time or if you don't have a metronome, count quarter notes out loud and play through the scale.\n\nMake sure to add these exercises to your daily practice, and playing triplets will soon feel like second nature.\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/courses/master-guitar-solos/employ-your-soloing-skills/practice-triplets//", "title": "Mahalo Guitar Solo Course: Triplet Practice", "publishedDate": "2011-09-23T22:41:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6XZ1jwiFUjc", "description": "http://www.lflmlaw.com \nLewis, Feldman, Lehane & McAtee, LLC is aware the court system can be intimidating and confusing.

I see them all the time while driving around in the Spring by looking for multi stemmed shrubs with light grey, fairly smooth bark, and covered with white flowers.  The berries have a 5 pointed crown on the bottom as well as multiple small seeds inside like apples, pears, blueberries, rose hips, and other pome fruits.  \n\nJuneberries are the perfect Edible Landscaping plant as well as a plant that should grow along the edges of all food forests.\n\nThis video was produced to promote the juneberry, edible landscaping, food forests, and sustainable living.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.]\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nBandipur National Park, established in 1974 as a tiger reserve under Project Tiger, is a national park located in the south Indian state of Karnataka. It was once a private hunting reserve for the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore. Bandipur is known for its wildlife and has many types of biomes, but dry deciduous forest is dominant.\n\nThe park spans an area of 874 square kilometers (337 sq mi), protecting several species of India's endangered wildlife. Together with the adjoining Nagarhole National Park (643 km2 (248 sq mi)), Mudumalai National Park (320 km2 (120 sq mi)) and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (344 km2 (133 sq mi)), it is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve totaling 2,183 km2 (843 sq mi) making it the largest protected area in southern India.\n\nBandipur is located in Gundlupet taluq of Chamarajanagar district. It is about 80 kilometers (50 mi) from the city of Mysore on the route to a major tourist destination of Ooty. As a result, Bandipur sees a lot of tourist traffic and there are a lot of wildlife fatalities caused by speeding vehicles that are reported each year. There is a ban on traffic from the hours of dusk to dawn to help bring down deaths of wildlife.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

After releasing his firing edit of Blasterjaxx's \"Fifteen,\" he quickly turns around an exhilarating new original in collaboration with the Los Angeles-based rising star, MAKJ. Ever since \"Countdown\" was dropped during his acclaimed set at Ultra Music Festival 2013, Hardwell has established the song as a peak-time secret weapon in his performances all summer, thus becoming one of his most highly anticipated tracks. With the new single as the soundtrack, the teaser video shows the sold-out Go Hardwell Or Go Home event at the Palladium in Los Angeles that saw MAKJ as support. \n\nHardwell brings on the burgeoning talent, MAKJ, to foster an explosive new sound that has been tested and proven throughout this year. As the teaser video runs through scenes of Los Angeles and the Palladium show, \"Countdown\" takes shape with a soft melody line that opens up to a lush chorus of synth strings on top of drums. A brief pause passes and the countdown ensues, raising anticipation for the drop and creating a strong sense of euphoria. Then the hard kicks and horn-like synth burst through with brute force taking the energy level to new heights. Following the main segment, it reaches a super charged climax as the second drop moves in with an added synth for full effect. The fact that \"Countdown\" has been one of the most buzzed about tracks for months is a testament to Hardwell's signature, festival anthem sound has been manifested at its fundamental core time and time again. \n\nDJ MAG TOP 100 Voting is still open, last chance to vote as it closes September 15th.

After 321 Eudemus toppled Taxiles, until he left India in 316 BC. Another general also ruled over the Greek colonies of the Indus: Peithon, son of Agenor, until his departure for Babylon in 316 BC.\nIn 305 BC, Seleucus I led an army to the Indus, where he encountered Chandragupta. The confrontation ended with a peace treaty, and \"an intermarriage agreement\" (Epigamia, Greek: \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1), meaning either a dynastic marriage or an agreement for intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. Accordingly, Seleucus ceded to Chandragupta his northwestern territories, possibly as far as Arachosia and received 500 war elephants (which played a key role in the victory of Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus):\n\"The Indians occupy in part some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants.\"\n\u2014Strabo 15.2.1\n--------------------------------------------\nI did not make this video and I do not own it.

This is NOT advice to be followed.\n\nI moved in with 2 new housemates, both in their 30's.\nHannah (not real name) and I lived and worked together.\nIt was my first week working so I copied exactly what Hannah ate.\nExcept she ate a large breakfast. \nBut I would only eat a biscuit with tea at about 8.30am because I was never hungry when I first woke up.\nAt lunch, we both had a cup-a-soup. 3pm an apple or cereal bar.\nWe ate dinner together, it was medium sized meal - example: pizza, pasta, curry, lasagne, with side salad etc (sometimes dessert but not often)\n\nExercise: We both power walked to work everyday and back 40minutes in total (nothing too intense)\n\nWhen I went home after a 2 months of being away, my parents told me I lost weight. \nI weighed myself and I had lost 14pounds.\nMy housemate had not lost any weight.\n\nI went to doctor that week to see what's going on with me because I lost my period 6 months previously too.\nDoctor said I am classified as Anorexic but I said I can't be, I eat.\nSo he said he would test me to find out why my body is losing weight.\n\nMost of my female colleagues in work were age 30, 40, 50+ and on diet or weight watchers and obsessed with baking, cooking and calories. \nThis was a new world for me and it fascinated me. \n\nI didn't change my food intake as I believe it was healthy and some of the other ladies were only eating 1 or 2 Rivita crackers for lunch, so I wasn't eating much less than any of the other women.\n\nI continued to lose tons of weight without trying and got multiple tests done (endoscopy/colonoscopy etc). Doctors still said it was Anorexia but my family, housemates and I were convinced I had some physical problem because I was getting pain in my left abdominal area and \"eating enough\".\n\nAfter 8 months of test, I was clear which made me wonder was it to do with my food intake afterall? \nI moved back home because I couldn't walk anymore and was aching all over my body.\nMy mum visited me nearly everyday.\nShe made me lunch and dinner but I struggled to eat it, it seemed so fattening and too large to consume. Even my favourite childhood meals I was now too scared to eat.\n\nEverything mum gave me eat I would panic and hide it, lie about eating it or eat it and feel EXTREMELY guilty. But I knew I had to keep fighting to gain back my strength and life. There was no other option.\n\nBy this stage I obviously knew there was a problem and that I really must not has been consuming as much calories as my body needed to sustain my lifestyle. \nI started to gain weight and I HATED it!! \n\nTHIS IS WHEN MY EATING DISORDER BEGAN TO REALLY CONSUME MY EVERY WAKING MOMENT.\n\nEvery pound was torture but I gained 43lbs, got used to my new body and I am much much happier now.

This is done to evaluate the baby's chromosomes to try to detect down syndrome and other chromosome problems as early as possible in the pregnancy.\n\nChorionic villus sampling, as amniocentesis, is completely optional. The advantage of doing chorionic villus sampling over amniocentesis is it can be done earlier because amniocentesis must be done somewhere between fifteen and eighteen weeks.\n\nChromosome abnormalities can't be fixed prior to delivery. Some reasons one might want to know what the baby's chromosomes status is is so that they can prepare for a baby that may not be totally normal or in some cases some people opt to do terminations of pregnancies on baby's that aren't completely normal chromosomally. And it's easier to do these terminations in an earlier pregnancy and that is why many people choose CVS over amniocentesis.", "title": "Should I have chorionic villus sampling?", "publishedDate": "2011-07-14T07:07:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YCmfOWHL-A", "description": "Togar, kontestan pilihan Judika yang mendapatkan Silver Ticket dari DreamBox mencoba memikat perhatian juri lewat suaranya.

Conocido tambi\u00e9n como fresno com\u00fan y fresno de hoja estrecha. En catal\u00e1n, arbre ver, fleix, freixe de fulla petita.\n\nEs un \u00e1rbol de crecimiento relativamente r\u00e1pido, pudiendo alcanzar los 15 a 20 metros de altura. La hoja est\u00e1 compuesta de un n\u00famero impar de foliolos (imparipinnada). Florece antes de echar la hoja al final del invierno.\n\nLa semilla est\u00e1 dentro de una s\u00e1mara. Madura a finales de verano. Se puede guardar en sitio fresco y, para hacerla germinar, basta dejarla un par de d\u00edas en agua (se echan en agua caliente, no hirviendo, y se dejan las 48 horas). Luego se siembra directamente en el alveolo o maceta, enterr\u00e1ndola entre 1 y 2 cm en el sustrato, plana.\n\nDe madera resistente se ha utilizado para herramientas. Su le\u00f1a es de buena calidad, arde muy bien, produciendo una llama viva, y dejando buen rescoldo, aunque no tan duradero como el de la encina. Por eso se dice que \"arde hasta creciendo\" aunque l\u00f3gicamente es mejor cuando la le\u00f1a est\u00e1 seca.\n\nPor su utilizaci\u00f3n para le\u00f1a y ramoneo hay muchos \"sotos\", que son fresnedas adehesadas, con ejemplares podados sucesivamente en cabeza de gato, con turnos de 15 a 30 a\u00f1os (seg\u00fan el clima), y de gruesos troncos (hasta 2 m de di\u00e1metro)\n\nSe distribuye por las riberas de los r\u00edos y zonas h\u00famedas, aguantando bien el fr\u00edo intenso.\n\nComo planta ornamental, es un \u00e1rbol de sombra abundante y fresca, que aguata muy bien la sequedad del ambiente siempre que tenga humedad en el suelo.\n\nOtras especies de fresnos son: Fraxinus excelsior (fresno de hoja ancha) y Fraxinus ornus (freno de flor)\n\nM\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre EL FRESNO (Fraxinus angustifolia) en: http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es/2011/03/el-fresno-fraxinus-angustifolia.html\n\nOtro v\u00eddeo en: http://youtu.be/UfXDOIc7-Hg\n\n( \u6c34\u66f2\u67f3, \u30e4\u30c1\u30c0\u30e2, \u042f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c)", "title": "EL FRESNO: Fraxinus angustifolia (http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-14T12:38:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YJ91FKZHI0", "description": "Kari Byron puts this theory to the test and the conclusion may surprise you! | For more MythBusters, visit http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/#mkcpgn=ytdsc1\n\nSubscribe to Discovery! | http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=discoverynetworks\n\nWatch full episodes! | http://bit.ly/MythBustersFullEps\n\nCheck out some classic MythBusters testing results! | http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/#mkcpgn=ytdsc1\n\nCheck out the Test Tube App | http://testu.be/1ndmmMq", "title": "Do Larger Breasts Equal Bigger Tips? | MythBusters", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T16:00:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YJZwtIvISU", "description": "The beginning of the video should've been \"Stroke Volume is altered or influenced by 3 things: Preload, Contractility, and afterload.\" Video also includes the Frank-Starling law of the heart.", "title": "Ap2 lecture 09/28/11 (Definitions) pt2", "publishedDate": "2011-09-29T01:40:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YK2A72L0BM", "description": "NXT NXC LEGO", "title": "Hollerith - SumoBot Test 1 / 17March10", "publishedDate": "2010-03-16T15:21:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YK5PpYyLEw", "description": "If your oven temperature is not consitent it may be the oven temperature probe.

This can be used as a dry night incentive or together with our reward charts so that children can earn their pocket money as well as your praise- \"If you have a dry nappy all week you will get your pocket money every Friday.\"\n\nThe best way to help children to prepare for a dry night is to:\n1. Ensure they go to the toilet before bed.\n2. If they need a bedtime drink at hand only leave half a cup.\n3. Make sure they know they must get up out of bed and go to the toilet when they feel the need to go.\n4. Emphasise that a nappy is not for going to the toilet in, it is only for when you are asleep and cannot control yourself and is a way of keeping the bed dry.\n5. If you have to wake your child up a few hours after they go to bed for the toilet, then again in the morning before they are due to get up to go again. This may affect their sleep pattern and cause tiredness but in severe cases it can help to stop bed wetting.\n\nRemember: Children do not have the ability to stop themselves wetting the bed, they can only take steps to ensure they are prepared for a dry night with their toileting routine. The average age that a child becomes dry at night is 5yrs, before then the brain and bladder are unable to fully communicate when it is full which causes children to wet themselves. Bladder control can only come with maturity, some children mature quicker than others, but giving a child a positive attitude and a stable routine to toilet will greatly improve their progression.", "title": "Helping Children To Stop Wetting The Bed", "publishedDate": "2011-07-23T17:24:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YTkA6vlrsY", "description": "~~~~Like and Sub if you enjoyed, stream link below.

PS is an anionic membrane phospholipid, physiologically restricted to the internal membrane leaflet; various pathophysiologic processes cause the exposure of PS on the external membrane leaflet. Bavituximab, once bound, starts up host effector activities, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, causing vessel destruction and enhancing antitumor immunity. Phase I clinical trials of bavituximab administered as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in adults with pretreated solid tumors have been accomplished, indicating that bavituximab can be safely dispensed weekly, with a recommended dose of 1 and 3 mg/kg. A Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial of bavituximab plus docetaxel, in the second-line therapy setting of locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, has been conducted and recently presented, suggesting a clinical benefit of the combination, with an overall response rate of 17% and median overall survival of more than 11 months. A Phase III trial is currently ongoing. Bavituximab has been studied in combination with platinum-based doublets with promising results. In the present paper we summarize the preclinical development and clinical experience with bavituximab in non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\nPlease see the full paper here: http://www.dovepress.com/profile-of-bavituximab-and-its-potential-in-the-treatment-of-non-small-peer-reviewed-article-LCTT", "title": "Profile of bavituximab and its potential in the treatment of NSCLC - Video abstract 37981", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T23:24:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YWf15Aunak", "description": "Video tour of Read&Write 5 GOLD for Mac - Sounds Like & Confusable Words feature", "title": "Read&Write 5 GOLD for Mac - Sounds Like & Confusable Words.FLV", "publishedDate": "2012-01-19T10:21:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YWjvTVPyo8", "description": "download/let\u00f6lt\u00e9s: https://soundcloud.com/burnbeats/elfroland-morus-lengyel-w-gier\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/breakersbeats\n\n\u201ePolak, W\u0119gier, dwa bratanki, i do szabli, i do szklanki.\"\n\u201eLengyel, Magyar, k\u00e9t j\u00f3 bar\u00e1t, egy\u00fctt harcol, s issza bor\u00e1t.\"\n\n\nsoha nem kaptunk semmit ingyen, \u00e1ra volt mindennek,\nmert mi nem talpra est\u00fcnk, hanem \u00f6ner\u0151b\u0151l \u00e1lltunk fel.\nne k\u00e9rdezd, hogy honnan j\u00f6tt\u00fcnk, azt se, hogy kik vagyunk,\njelent\u00e9ktelen, azzal ellent\u00e9tben, hogy mit akarunk.\nnem egy orsz\u00e1g, nem egy nyelv, \nde minden lengyel, legyen egyel t\u00f6bb ok arra,\nhogy a bar\u00e1t sz\u00f3 ma t\u00f6bbet jelent nek\u00fcnk\nitt a kapcsolat, r\u00e1zzuk \u00f6ssze a mancsokat,\nez feladat, ha a testv\u00e9r\u00fcnkr\u0151l van sz\u00f3, \n\u00e1ll\u00edtsunk fel k\u00f6z\u00f6s brancsokat.\na c\u00e9l, min\u00e9l t\u00f6bb karcolat, az elv \u00f6r\u00f6kk\u00e9 fenn marad,\nhogy egy\u00fctt isszuk borunkat \u00e9s egy\u00fctt v\u00edvunk harcokat.\nez adjon minden lengyelnek \u00e9s magyarnak is t\u00e1maszt,\naddig boldog lesz az \u00e9nek, m\u00edg a hall\u00e1s el nem v\u00e1laszt..\nKielce - Borsod, mindegy hol vagy, az a l\u00e9nyeg,\nismered a sorsod, ha a baj j\u00f6n, megv\u00e9ded a testv\u00e9red.\na k\u00f6z\u00f6s t\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmed ut\u00e1n, legyen k\u00f6z\u00f6s a m\u00e1d,\nmert ez tudod t\u00f6bbet \u00e9r, mint 24 kar\u00e1t..\n..egy bar\u00e1t, minket h\u00e1tulr\u00f3l ez fedez,\nellenben minden ellent\u00e9ttel \u00e9rt\u00e9kileg nemes.\n\u00f6sszek\u00f6t, ahogy az \u00f6t sz\u00edn egyk\u00e9nt \u00f6ssze\u00f6nt,\na feh\u00e9r - piros, a piros - feh\u00e9r - z\u00f6ld.", "title": "elfroland & Morus - Lengyel Magyar / Polak W\u0119gier (Prod.

The character was created by director Frank Capra, chairman of the U.S. Army Air Force First Motion Picture Unit, and most were written by Theodor \"Dr. Seuss\" Geisel, Philip D. Eastman, and Munro Leaf.[1] Although the United States Army gave Walt Disney the first crack at creating the cartoons, Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. animation studio underbid Disney by two-thirds and won the contract. Disney had also demanded exclusive ownership of the character, and merchandising rights. Nel (2007) shows the goal was to help enlisted men with weak literacy skills learn through animated cartoons (and also supplementary comic books). They featured simple language, racy illustrations, no profanity, and subtle moralizing. Private Snafu did everything wrong, so that his negative example taught basic lessons about secrecy, disease prevention, and proper military protocols.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Snafu", "title": "Private Snafu ~ Spies - Military Training Cartoon - Chuck Jones (1943)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T03:04:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6YYCBmRKSXQ", "description": "This plane was at the FBO when I landed at Burlington, VT.
