Many of the drugs, when taken in combination, were found to more than treble an elderly patient's chance of dying within two years. \n\nCommon bladder medications, heart drugs, eye drops and asthma treatments were also among those found to pose a risk.\n\nAll the drugs work by blocking a key chemical in the nervous system called acetylcholine.\n\nThe researchers placed each of the drugs into one of three groups based on how effectively they blocked acetylcholine. The more effective the drug was in blocking the chemical, the more dangerous it was in high doses.\n\nThe most dangerous included the antihistamines chlorphenamine (used in the brand Piriton) and promethazine (used in Phenergan), the anti-depressant paroxetine (used in Seroxat) and the incontinence drug oxybutynin (used in Ditropan).\n\nThe heartburn drug ranitidine (used in Zantac), beta blocker Atenolol, the painkiller codeine and some eye drops were among the drugs in the mildest category.\n\nLow-risk drugs were graded one point while high-risk drugs were graded three. The study found that patients who took a combination of drugs that added up to four points or more \u2014 such as a high-risk antihistamine combined with low-risk eye drops \u2014 had a 20 per cent chance of dying within two years, compared with just seven per cent for over-65s who did not take anything.\n\nThe risk of dying increased by a further 25 per cent for each additional point accumulated, the study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, concluded.\n\nThe scientists suggest that the combination of treatments could also exacerbate dementia. In patients showing early signs of mental impairment high doses could \"tip them over\" into a more confused state, they said.\n\nPrevious research has shown that acetylcholine-blocking drugs could have a harmful impact on the brain.", "title": "\u2620 Dangerous Prescription Drug Warning \u2620", "publishedDate": "2011-06-25T00:47:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sJABi_iW1c", "description": "en el bike fest un motociclista explota su llanta", "title": "quemando llanta en el bike fest 2012 y pelea con los cobras", "publishedDate": "2012-06-27T22:34:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sJGDe_SYm4", "description": "Thriller/Romance -- Espa\u00f1a -- 2010\nJoana Prats sufre agnosia, una extra\u00f1a enfermedad neuropsicol\u00f3gica que afecta a su percepci\u00f3n.

Knowing how to measure Forex volatility is useful in that it gives the trader insight into the currency pair or pairs he is trading. Knowing how to measure Forex volatility goes hand in hand with basic technical analysis of market sentiment is seen in price patterns. Forex volatility can be measured in pips or as a percent. It is simply the difference between the high and the low price of one currency in relation to another. It can be stated for a day, week, month or any time frame. Pips are the smallest unit change by which a currency can be quoted. For pairs including the US dollar a pip is $0.0001 or a hundredth of a cent. When the price of the dollar versus the Euro varies by half a cent in a day the volatility is 50 pips. Measured in percent it is 0.5%. More statistically based measures use the standard deviation and more complicated measures. How to measure Forex volatility for the less mathematically inclined is to stick with pips and percents. There are charts available on the internet that will do the more serious mathematical calculations for you. In learning how to trade Forex a trader will want a basic sense of how volatile the market is and what that means for profit versus risk.\n\nMany Forex technical strategies relate to market volatility. If a currency pair is trading in high volume technical analysis tools typically work better as they are based on statistics. During times of market upheaval, such as we are now seeing due to the unrest across North Africa and the Middle East, traders look to profit from anticipating price direction. When volatility is high many will rely upon buying options, puts and calls, because the buyer of an option only risks the price of the option, the premium. Even though his risk is low due to buying options the trader will have the right, but no obligation, to purchase or sell one currency with the other and profit should the price move as anticipated. Today many currencies are under stress due to the risk of a large upward movement in the price of oil. Typically this means that traders will move to the dollar as a safe haven currency. However, the US views inflation as more of a risk than unemployment at this point and is keeping interest rates low. If the EU or Great Britain, for example, raise their rates traders will move money into the currency with the higher rate, driving up the value of that currency and driving the dollar down. Traders will often buy futures on the Euro or dollar or options in anticipation of changes in monetary policy and continuing volatility. How to measure Forex volatility in these times is a useful skill as it can allow the trader to formulate and execute a successful Forex trading strategy no matter where the markets are going as it helps him decide on strategy, such as direct trading versus options and upon which currency pairs to trade.", "title": "How to Measure Forex Volatility", "publishedDate": "2011-03-06T13:53:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sLGo05S6Tk", "description": "I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO.

It is the fifteenth installment in the Grand Theft Auto series.\nAnnounced on October 25, 2011, the game's first trailer was released on November 2, 2011, at 4:00 PM GMT. The game was initially slated for a Spring 2013 release, but was pushed to September 17th the same year. Then, on July 15, 2013, Rockstar announced the Japanese release date for the game: October 10, 2013, almost a month after it will be released in the west.\nGrand Theft Auto V is to be set in modern-day Los Santos and its surrounding areas and tells the stories of three protagonists: Michael, Franklin and Trevor.\nThe single-player mode of Grand Theft Auto V is told through three player-controlled protagonists; Michael, Trevor and Franklin, criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. While interacting with the game world, the player may switch between them at will. During missions, switching characters may be presented as necessary in order to complete certain objectives, or as an optional alternative to find creative ways to interact with the characters; for example, in one such mission Michael rappels down the side of a building and Franklin provides covering fire with a sniper rifle, while Trevor controls the getaway helicopter, and the player can switch between controlling them to accommodate for a preferred play style.", "title": "GTA V How to Get SCUBA GEAR (GTA5) Free With out Submarine", "publishedDate": "2013-09-21T09:06:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sUpYLPGejw", "description": "Learn about how online advertising fraud happens and what is being done across the industry to combat the issue.

The new venture is increasing their income and reducing their workload.\n\nSTORY:\nTraditional crops here are giving way to floriculture farming. And the villages around the Jammu region are reaping the rewards. \n\nThe state floriculture department came up with the idea and the farmers have never looked back. \n\nIncome is up and their crop is picked up at the gate meaning no more trips to the market. \n\n[Kuldeep Raj, Farmer]: \n\"Earlier we used to grow vegetables in this field and it used to last for three months and we used to earn around 2,000 rupees from it. But since we have started growing these gladioli, we earn around 15,000 to 16,000 rupees. Growing flowers has also benefited us in another way, earlier we had to carry the vegetables to the market for selling but the flower association people come and take the flowers directly from us so it saves us the time of going to the market.\"\n\nThe Jammu region alone supplies half of the market needs in the state, worth around 100 million rupees. \n\nFlowers used to be imported from outside the region but now the growers are filling local orders and also exporting to other parts of the country.\n\nThe increasing work could help ease growing unemployment in the state. \n\n[Tejinder Singh, President, Flower Growing Association]: \n\"We want to convey a message to the government that it is a vocation which can become an avenue for employment in the region. We can initiate more and more people towards floriculture to wipe out the growing unemployment in the region.\"\n\nThe authority responsible for floriculture in India says flower cultivation has more potential than most other field crops.", "title": "Farmers Turn to Flowers in India", "publishedDate": "2009-02-04T23:27:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sWbt1Jrkm8", "description": "http://johnhehir.com.au/salary-packaging/john-hehir-salary-packaging/\nJohn Hehir - Novated Lease example - Salary Packaging\nHow to use Salary Sacrifice Calculator, Salary Packaging Calculator, and Novated Lease Calculator for Australia.", "title": "John Hehir - Novated Lease example - Salary Packaging", "publishedDate": "2011-03-29T13:42:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sWdJmofr1M", "description": "Seen at Kinterbury Creek, Plymouth, 18/4/14", "title": "Common Earwig - Forficula auricularia?", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T19:23:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6sWiFU0FI3c", "description": ". . .

See more about it here:\nhttp://clearballistics.com\n \n\nThe invention of the G2R's projectile R.I.P.\u2122 is related to the ability to control the way the projectile reacts as it passes through different mediums by control of the mfg process, geometry and the rate of failure at different zones along its axial length. More particularly but not limited to the ability to take the projectile and predictably have it stay solid in one medium but yet have the exact same projectile predictably react as a fragmenting bullet through a different medium without alteration of the projectile. The geometry at the tip of the projectile has much to do with the way the projectile travels through tissue. It has been long known in the medical industry that a trocar point penetrates the dermis layer more efficiently. Patents for trocars appeared early in the 19th century, although their use dated back possibly thousands of years. It is the use of this geometry at the front end of the projectile that does specific work at the point of entry from one system to the next. Dependent on the medium the projectiles geometry is designed to react differently.\n\nImagine a Hole saw. The hole saw action that occurs at points of entry into different mediums reduce initial drag which allow the hollow cavity in the center of the projectile to rapidly pack. In the case of plywood the hole saw action cleanly cuts and packs the projectile with a slug that makes it solid thus allowing it to conserve more of its energy. This performance could prove to be very effective for law enforcement that may be in a situation where the target is behind such an obstacle whereas more energy will be carried into the intended target and not lost in the obstacle.\n\nIn a fluid the projectile fragments. Due to the trocar geometry of each petal the resulting diameter of the fragmentation pattern is maximized.

So you gotta make sure you're using it right.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is adjust the squelch. This is pretty simple: just turn it until it hisses, and then back it off until the hissing stops. That will eliminate all the unnecessary static.\n\nTune to the channel you want, and then take the microphone and hold it at a 90 degree angle to your face. Speak slowly and clearly as you key the mike.\n\nOkay, now, let's make sure the radio's working properly by doing a radio check. First, tune to a station that's an open frequency, like channel 68. Then repeat three times, \"Radio check, radio check, radio check\" and the name of your vessel. \n\n\"Radio check, radio check, radio check, Norfolk Marine Grady-White.\"\n\nLet's see if anyone responds.\n\n\"Grady White, sounds good.\"\n\nAh! Sounds like the other guys in the parking lot hear us!\n\nIn many areas you can now do an automated radio check as well. SeaTow provides the service. I looked on the internet earlier and discovered that channel 28 is the right one for that in this area. \n\n\"Radio check, radio check, radio check, Norfolk Marine Grady White.\"\n\n\"Thank you for using the automated radio check provided by Sea Tow, located at Little Creek Marina in Norfolk.\" \n\nNow you would never do a radio check on Channel 16. 16 is reserved for emergencies and emergencies only. In case of emergency, go directly to Channel 16 and if you have a DSC equipped radio, hit your distress button. \n\nNow remember, your radio has to be linked in with your GPS or have an internal GPS in order for DSC to function. \n\nIn case of a life-threatening emergency, use the call sign \"Mayday\" and repeat it three times to call the Coast Guard.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to use a VHF, check out our feature on boats.com.", "title": "How to Use a VHF: It Might Save Your Life", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T09:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6st4KrgIYKo", "description": "Cuarto video de una serie de 10 donde muestro la recuperaci\u00f3n de un ejemplar de Taxodium distichum.", "title": "Recuperaci\u00f3n de un Taxodium Distichum (4)", "publishedDate": "2009-03-07T20:55:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6stsId4afF0", "description": "(\u273f\u25e0\u203f\u25e0) OPEN FOR LINKS, CODES AND CRAP ~\u2764\n\n\u2730 Instagram: (anaavenge) http://instagram.com/anaavenge/\n\u2730 Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/anastasiamaypage\n\u2730 Keek: http://www.keek.com/anaavenge\n\u2730 Twitter: (@anaavenge) https://twitter.com/anaavenge\n\nFREE GRAZE BOX CODE! ~\u2665 HMR6N5L \u2665~\nFREE BREAKFAST BOX CODE! ~\u2665 CR1VWYV \u2665~", "title": "GRAZE BOXES!", "publishedDate": "2013-05-04T18:32:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6suCR5mEeNk", "description": "Please visit us at  http://www.TreasureMountainMining.com to see this and over 2,000 more fine mineral specimens", "title": "6\" Botryoidal Green MOTTRAMITE Crystals No Damage Mina Ojuela Mexico for sale", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T18:49:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6svbbMkxLso", "description": "These are the wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

You may realize that what you are is ever realized and it never needs any more or less realization. And whatever comes on top of it, as a concept or any experience, belongs to that body-mind-organism or whatever kind of idea. It is as fleeting as this (pointing to the body). So that fleeting experience belongs to a fleeting experience. So you have to look for that permanent experience, you have to look for this omnipresence, which is never coming or going, which is the essence of any circumstance and not depending on any change. That is the basis of existence, which is your nature, which is silence and cannot be interrupted by anything, nor given by anyone. No-one can teach it to you or un-teach you that. It cannot be taken, so it cannot be given. So be as you are. And see the dream, or that first notion of existence, which is the second as you are the experiencer of that. You are simply prior to any concept or any experience. And that separate experiencer, if it would be real it would be permanent, but it is always changing, moment by moment. Simply see, that what can change cannot be what you are. As there was in every given moment since you were born, there is that, which is pure perception, which was never changed by anything that was ever perceived or by any circumstance. And see, that relative perceiver, which is changing every moment or every day, is simply part of the scene. But you are that what is in-no-sense. Whatever you can sense is imagination, fleeting shadows, empty or dead you may say. But this life that you are, which is absolute, cannot be touched by that. So be that unborn. And not taking that mistake, becoming a me-steak, for real. With this mistake the whole drama starts. The psychic hospital of the world comes with that mistake: Taking whatever you can experience as real. Even the first \"Atma\", the first soul, the I-idea, already is second. By seeing that you are not what you can experience you are that absolute seer, which can never be changed by anything that can be seen or experienced. And that is silence.

Presidential love triangle at Illinois Polls.\n(CBS) \u2014 President Barack Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Lincoln Park Monday after casting his ballot on the first day of early voting in Illinois. \nCBS 2\u2019s Jim Williams reports the president had quite an encounter with a couple of voters this morning at his polling place at 43rd and Cottage Grove. \nThe president did vote with the predictable fanfare and sounds of cameras, but what happened as he stood next to fellow voter Aia Cooper was not expected.\nMike Jones, Cooper\u2019s boyfriend, told President Obama, \u201cdon\u2019t touch my girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cI said, I know you\u2019re Mr. President, but don\u2019t touch my girlfriend,\u201d Jones said.\nYep, Jones teased the president.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. I was just shaking. I said \u2018Oh boy, this is the president. What am I supposed to do?\u201d Cooper said.\nThe president expressed mock annoyance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an example of a brother just embarrassing me for no reason, just for no reason whatsoever.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama predicted what Cooper would say later to her friends.\n\n\u201c\u2018I can\u2019t believe Mike \u2014 he\u2019s such a fool. I was just mortified. Fortunately, the president was nice about it. So it\u2019s alright,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \n\nJones says that, \u201cIt was so silent in there and everyone was just taking pictures I figured I had to say something to make people laugh.\u201d\n\nIt was President Obama who got the last laugh as he gave Cooper a hug and kissed her on the cheek.\n\n\u201cGive me a kiss and give him something to talk about. Now, he\u2019s really jealous.\u201d \n\nNo jealousy, just an everlasting memory.\n\nMike and Aia say they didn\u2019t know the president was going to be there on the same day they were planning to vote. One day, they\u2019ll tell their grandkids about it. \n\nAfter the president voted, he made a stop at one of Gov. Quinn\u2019s campaign offices on 47th St. The governor and Senator Dick Durbin were both there. The president brought sweets and encouraged campaign workers. \n\nPresident Obama arrived in Chicago Sunday night and attended a rally for Illinois Democrats at Chicago State University. The president left Chicago about 6:15 p.m. after leaving a fundraiser where he was expected to raise $400,000. \n\nSouth Side Pastor Corey Brooks is a staunch supporter of GOP gubernatorial nominee Bruce Rauner and, he thinks people will be able to separate support for the president versus the candidates.\n\n\u201cOur message is the same. This is not a race between Bruce Rauner and President Obama. This is a race between Bruce Rauner and Pat Quinn and based upon that, we still tell people to do the exact same thing that we\u2019re telling them all the time, that is vote for Bruce Rauner because we absolutely believe he\u2019s the best candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nPastor Brooks says he still supports Mr. Obama and voted for him for both times for president.\n\n 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend' 'Obama don't touch my girlfriend'\nDon't touch my girlfriend Obama\nVoters joke around with the Prez.\nMan to Obama: Don't Touch My Girlfriend (VIDEO) Chicago Polling Station\nPresident Obama cast his ballot in Chicago during early voting for the 2014 Midterm Elections.

Most of the bark has been left on, taken down at the 5th and 6th tone holes to decrease the wall thickness there, for better tuning and responsiveness.  Bark fissures and knot holes have been inlayed with crushed Turquoise and the whole branch has been finely finished and sealed, insuring that the bark will remain tight to the wood grain over the long life of this beautiful flute. To help prevent wet-out, the bird has been fitted with a redwood shoe, for its absorption qualities, and a drain hole has been designed into the air chamber.  Deer lacing with Turquoise and carved bone beads secures the bird to the nest.

I've been writing music most of my life. Songs have always been the place where I've sorted out the events of day. If you trace these songs back far enough they tell a story of where I've been and what I've seen along the way. That said, most people don't have the time to sort through the hundreds of songs that have collected in the wake of my 20 plus years behind a piano, and that's why I love \"Cecilia and the Satellite\". As a song it encapsulate so much living against the back drop of a new life. Cecilia was written with the knowledge that my wife and I would soon meet our first child. With the hope of avoiding territory this type of song often treads, I tried to create a road map of the life I had lived leading up to that moment. One my daughter might look back on some day. A strange life of constant motion, spent traveling in the pursuit of music. A life I've nearly lost on more than one occasion and one which I am thankful for, now more than ever. Deep down this song is about more than me and where I've been, it's about more than my daughter and what I want for her. It's about being proud of where you come from and wanting the most for the people you share your world with.\n\n\nDownload on iTunes http://bit.ly/1pLO1CS, Amazon http://amzn.to/1nLDmUA, or listen to it on Spotify http://spoti.fi/1syeRBY.\n\nNew album out now get it on iTunes\nhttp://smarturl.it/AMITWalbum\n\nLYRICS\nI've locked myself in a hotel room\nThen waited all night for the walls to move\nI've loved some girls that I barely knew\nI've made some friends, and I've lost some too\n\nCrashed my car, I was seventeen\nMy mother in the seat riding next to me\nThe things I've learned from a broken mirror\nHow a face can change when a heart knows fear\n\nFor all the things my eyes have seen, the best by far is you\n\nIf I could fly, then I would know\nWhat life looks like from up above and down below\nI'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry\nDon't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite\nAnd you're the sky\n\nOh, Oh\n\nI've caf\u00e9 crawled through Amsterdam\nBeen around the world with a punk rock band\nAnd I've seen London, and I've played Japan\nI've been knocked down, I got up again\n\nFor all the places I have been, I'm no place without you\n\nIf I could fly, then I would know\nWhat life looks like from up above and down below\nI'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry\nDon't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite\nAnd you're the sky\n\nOh, Oh\nI'm the satellite\nAnd you're the sky\n\nFor all the things my hands have held, the best by far is you\n\nIf I could fly, then I would know\nWhat life looks like from up above and down below\nI'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry\nDon't be afraid, Cecilia, I'm the satellite\nAnd you're the sky\nAnd you're the sky\nI'm the satellite\nAnd you're the sky\nAnd you're the sky\n\nhttp://andrewmcmahon.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/andrewmcmahonmusic\nhttp://twitter.com/andrewmcmahon\nhttp://instagram.com/amnthewilderness\nhttp://soundcloud.com/andrewmcmahon\n\nFALL HEADLINE TOUR\n10/14 - San Diego, CA @ House of Blues - http://bit.ly/1yYqOkK\n10/15 - Los Angeles, CA @ The Fonda Theatre - http://bit.ly/WByOuq\n10/17 - San Francisco, CA @ Slim's - http://bit.ly/1rzkgIl\n10/18 - San Francisco, CA @ The Independent - http://ticketf.ly/1qt16Qb\n10/20 - Vancouver, BC @ Rio Theatre - http://ticketf.ly/1lgq5mN\n10/21 - Portland, OR @ Hawthorne Theatre - http://bit.ly/1s7DkfH\n10/22 - Seattle, WA @ The Neptune - http://bit.ly/1s7jv73\n10/23 - Boise, ID @ Knitting Factory - http://tktwb.tw/1oRlf4z\n10/25 - Denver, CO @ The Summit Music Hall -http://tktwb.tw/UObJ61\n10/26 - Kansas City, MO @ Uptown Theater - http://bit.ly/1rEodLX\n10/28 - St. Louis, MO @ The Ready Room - http://ticketf.ly/1jY8FQt\n10/29 - Minneapolis, MN @ First Avenue -http://bit.ly/1pfF6Jw\n10/31 - Chicago, IL @ Vic Theatre -http://bit.ly/1rA94tx\n11/1 - Cincinnati, OH @ Bogart's (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/2 - Detroit, MI @ St. Andrews Hall (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/5 - Toronto, ON @ Opera House - http://bit.ly/1oesVZu\n11/16 - Charlotte, NC @ Visulite Theatre (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/18 - St. Petersburg, FL @ The State Theatre (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/19 - Orlando, FL @ Beacham Theater (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/21 - Atlanta, GA @ Center Stage (Pre-sale 8/6, On sale 8/8)\n11/22 - Nashville, TN @ 3rd & Lidsley - http://tktwb.tw/1xFXe0Z\n11/24 - Austin, TX @ Emo's - http://bit.ly/1nYy73G\n11/25 - Houston, TX @ Fitzgerald's - Upstairs - http://tktwb.tw/1s7Lh4s\n11/26 - Dallas, TX @ Granada Theater - http://bit.ly/Ur88uE\n11/28 - Las Vegas, NV @ Hard Rock Live - http://tktwb.tw/1t0t9em\n11/29 - Santa Ana, CA @ The Observatory - http://tktwb.tw/1lgvpXt", "title": "Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness - Cecilia and the Satellite (AUDIO)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T22:24:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6tZ-MYDojDg", "description": "", "title": "The Role Of Telomerase", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T03:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6tZ2N7vX3_Q", "description": "http://capefearnaturals.com CoQ10 is a nutritional supplement.

Toute la famille se trouve \u00e0 l'abri du besoin gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une harpe magique qui donne le pouvoir \u00e0 une poule de pondre des \u0153ufs en or massif. Mais ces pr\u00e9cieux tr\u00e9sors sont un jour d\u00e9rob\u00e9s par un ogre f\u00e9roce. Jack et sa famille se retrouvent dans la mis\u00e8re.\n\nPour survivre, le jeune gar\u00e7on part au march\u00e9 vendre la vache Raspoustine et chemin faisant, il rencontre un curieux personnage, pianiste virtuose de son \u00e9tat, qui lui propose d'\u00e9changer sa vache contre une poign\u00e9e de haricots, soi-disant magiques...\n\nSur fond de riffs rock'n'roll et narration (presque) traditionnelle, l'auteur Georges Dupuis et le compositeur Philippe Manca ont ainsi revitalis\u00e9 un r\u00e9cit anglo-saxon vieux de trois si\u00e8cles, pass\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ration par le talent des conteurs populaires.\n\nSi l'intrigue reste la m\u00eame, les comparses ont bien chang\u00e9. Par exemple, la vache Raspoutine est ici une ancienne vedette de la Costa Brava, le coq se transforme en rock-star entour\u00e9e de poulettes amoureuses, l'Ogre au visage bariol\u00e9 semble tout droit sorti d'un groupe de heavy-metal...\n\nAu fil de l'histoire, entra\u00een\u00e9 par les rythmes cubains, swing ou rock, l'enfant s'\u00e9veille ainsi \u00e0 la musique et \u00e0 l'humour de ces personnages rocambolesques et d\u00e9cal\u00e9s.

It's really about having a very strong liberal arts education in addition to very careful ethical thought about what it means to be a good citizen and a good community member. \n\nThe Jesuits are committed to careful, thoughtful, rigorous approach to anything they study. But, they're also committed to action. I find that a lot of people are extremely driven at Loyola. They come here to have that service opportunity, to be with other kids that have those goals.Quite a number of our students do Alternative Break immersions, go and maybe build a house in Mexico or go to the Appalachian's and build a house.

Se caracterizan por carecer de cola, por presentar un cuerpo corto y muy ensanchado, y por las patas posteriores m\u00e1s desarrolladas y adaptadas para el salto. Los anuros son el grupo m\u00e1s numeroso de anfibios; se estima que existen m\u00e1s de 5.000 especies, repartidas en 48 familias.1 La mayor\u00eda pasa su vida dentro o cerca del agua. Su tama\u00f1o puede variar desde un par de mil\u00edmetros, como es el caso de las especies del g\u00e9nero Eleutherodactylus,2 hasta tallas que superan los 30 cent\u00edmetros, destacando la rana goliat, el anuro m\u00e1s grande del mundo.\n\nLos nombres \u00abrana\u00bb y \u00absapo\u00bb se refer\u00edan en un principio a los dos tipos de anuros que aparecen en la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica: las ranas t\u00edpicas (las del g\u00e9nero Rana), y los sapos t\u00edpicos (los del g\u00e9nero Bufo); pero en la actualidad se usan para otros grupos de forma indiscriminada y arbitraria. \u00abRana\u00bb suele referirse a las especies m\u00e1s gr\u00e1ciles, de piel h\u00fameda y lisa, buenas saltadoras, y de h\u00e1bitos trepadores o acu\u00e1ticos. \u00abSapo\u00bb hace referencia a las especies de piel m\u00e1s seca y rugosa, m\u00e1s robustas, marchadoras, menos \u00e1giles y que suelen habitar en el suelo h\u00famedo excavando galer\u00edas. Por tanto, esta distinci\u00f3n entre ranas y sapos no es una discriminaci\u00f3n que tenga validez taxon\u00f3mica.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFrogs are amphibians in the order Anura (meaning \"tail-less\", from Greek an-, without + oura, tail), formerly referred to as Salientia (Latin salere (salio), \"to jump\"). Most frogs are characterized by a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding eyes and the absence of a tail. Frogs are widely known as exceptional jumpers, and many of the anatomical characteristics of frogs, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance. Due to their permeable skin, frogs are often semi-aquatic or inhabit humid areas, but move easily on land. They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes, and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and develop in water. Adult frogs follow a carnivorous diet, mostly of arthropods, annelids and gastropods. Frogs are most noticeable by their call, which can be widely heard during the night or day, mainly in their mating season.\nThe distribution of frogs ranges from tropic to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species described, they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. However, populations of certain frog species are declining significantly.\nA popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance, but this has no taxonomic basis. (Members of the anuran family Bufonidae are called true toads, but many species from other families are also called toads.)

Metabolites have various functions, including fuel, structure, signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory effects on enzymes, catalytic activity of their own (usually as a cofactor to an enzyme), defense, and interactions with other organisms (e.g. pigments, odorants, and pheromones). A primary metabolite is directly involved in normal \"growth\", development, and reproduction. c2h4 is an example of a primary metabolite produced in large-scale by industrial microbiology. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function.

Dealer fitted option; Rear seat belts.  \n\nEXTERIOR\nFinished in Sienna Brown, (colour code 23), this remarkable Triumph has full, rich shine worthy of any club stand.  Having been paraded at numerous classic car shows the vehicle was treated to a repaint in December 2003 and a few minor markings can be seen on very close inspection but these do not detract from the overall grandeur this car offers.  The chrome bumpers have a reflective finish with minute age related pitting.  All the correct badging and trim remains undamaged including the silver 1500 nose badge indicating the higher 65bhp model.   The supplying Dealer, James Calver Ltd of Great Yarmouth, number plates and rear window sticker are present.  A beautiful example.  \n\nINTERIOR\nRichly comfortable the perforated P.V.C seats are finished in New Tan colour scheme, (code 33) and are perfect.  The plush matt walnut veneer dash houses a comprehensive range of instruments and controls which all function correctly and match the walnut door cappings with no damage.   The deep pile brown carpet has worn slightly and the roof lining has minor markings but is tight and very clean.  Comfort is guaranteed with wide front seats adjustable fore and aft, rake, height, and even a steering column that is adjustable both vertically and axially.  The full width divan type rear seat with centre folding armrest offers comfort for passengers and a large clean boot with original covering ample space for luggage.  A rare survivor.\n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nAt the heart of this Triumph 1500 is a later 1493cc unit producing 65bhp which gives the car eager performance and is elegantly nimble.  Quiet, smooth and simple this car offers fun yet practical classic car ownership.  The four speed, all synchromesh gearbox is light, precise and a joy to use. \n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nPressed steel disc wheels with immaculate stainless steel trims are all shod in matching 165 R13 tyres with ample tread.  Disc brakes up front and self-adjusting drums at the rear are servo-assisted and offer powerful straight line stopping power.\n \nHISTORY FILE\nRegistered new on 1st April 1972 by Triumph selling agents James Calver Ltd of Great Yarmouth to original owner Mr C W Spandler, this car has since had three further owners.  The current owner a member of the Triumph Owners Club, Mr Pratt has cherished the car since August 2006.  With the vehicle comes a comprehensive history file comprising of the original British Leyland Passport to Service booklet, all handbooks and a broad collection of specialist receipts and invoices.  An original British Leyland Repair Operation Manual and previous MOT certificates complete the fastidious history records.  The vehicles very low 36,880 miles in proud ownership provide a budget entry into affordable classic car ownership yet still retaining the important low owner/mileage criteria desired by many, with brilliant club support and parts availability.

There are several different coat colour morphs ranging from black to red. The underside of the squirrel is always white-cream in colour. The lifespan of the red squirrel is on average 3 years.\nThe red squirrel eats mostly the seeds of trees, neatly stripping conifer cones to get at the seeds within. In this movie the squirrel is feeding on hazelnuts.\n\nVisit WWW.STOCKSHOT.NL for highres version or broadcast video footage.

It's the number one reason for tooth loss in this country. Why does it happen? It's really because of plague and bacteria. It's the bacteria that causes inflammation of your own body, but your body is doing the right thing because it wants to kill the bacteria. But, in essence, it's your own body, along with the bacteria, that's causing all that bone loss around your teeth.\n\nBone is what anchors your teeth into place, so when you start get bone loss you start losing the support of your teeth. They become loose and they fall out and it's really because of the plaque and the bacteria that are underneath your gum tissue, along with your own body doing what it needs to do. If we can remove all the plague and bacteria from underneath your gum tissue we cannot necessarily reverse it, but we can actually grow back some of the bone that you lost from this infection. \n\nWhether it be from deep cleaning, whether we need to do any surgical cleanings, we can actually do all that stuff right here in the office. We numb you up the same way you would get a filling and we do the work. You could go to work the same day. But it's very important for us to remove all this plague and bacteria so not only can we keep your teeth in longer, but more importantly, that infection doesn't spread throughout the rest of your body. \n\nThat's very important because periodontal disease is now associated with some of the systemic problems. Heart disease, liver problems, kidney problems, premature births, they're all associated with periodontal disease. Why? Because of the fact that it's all inflammatory disease. Diabetes, very important. If we can treat the periodontal disease, you can decrease your diabetes and some of the other systemic disorders that I just mentioned and vice versa. So they're all interconnected. The mouth is no longer separate from the body. It's all connected.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding periodontal disease, systemic health problems associated with periodontal disease, please call us at the number below for a complimentary consultation and see how I can help you.\n\nDr. Vikas Mittle - Board Certified Periodontist\nShine Dental Associates of the North Shore\n400 Jericho Turnpike\nSyosset, NY 11791", "title": "How to Treat Periodontal Disease - Dr. Vikas Mittle - Board Certified Periodontist - Long Island", "publishedDate": "2013-08-14T14:30:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uXi6iYxV_I", "description": "Flying in the sky on a dragon \nIt's a never ending story just imagine \nJust imagine \n\nOpening 7 gates \n\nThat a lot to believe in \n\nAs stressful as life may get you gotta \nAwaken your true awareness\nTaking a kernes to your senses  from within \n\n\nDon't stray off to ignorance it's a blissfull content in your own mind state \n\n\ndon't stray off  and take yourself out of context \n\nLive life to the fullest \nPotential \n\nAnd truely then you'll be living life grand \n\n\n\nI\nSpit infinite wisdom \n \n\nImpelling traits from stems \n\nIn root linked to my cerebellum \n\n\nEquilibrium \n\nEqual to other mammals \n\nIn living in every one else's proclamation's \n\n\nInhaling this \nNeoplatonism an \nOrganic plant life organism that's \nEmitting chlorophyll of magnesium a porphyrin atom in the Plutonium   ring \n\n\nheterocycle's \nSuiting its surroundings \n\nMaking me adaptable \n\nExpanding  my well being \n\nEven  if  it may poise as a poison\n\nStemming in thru my roots \n\nTo my equilibrium and cerebellum \n\n\nParalyzing my spinels movements \nParlaying\n\n\nTransforming me into a spiritual being \nMeaning I'm impervious \n\nUnaffected by \nothers inhabitants inherited \n\nUnequal to the \nHabited traits \n\nMeaning \n\nI'm indifferent \n\nHesitant  \nFrom \nAll this swag shit \n\nYou like too revel and bask  in \n\n\nI'm a rebel \n\nToo all this hype movements \n\n\nI'm resistant to the strengths \nrestraints \n\nFrom others traits \n\n\nStrength moves in numbers \nSo ever bodies \nToo \nBusy dick riding each other \n\nI lead my own congress \n\nAnd express my followers \n\nTo live in peace and happiness \n\n\nSit back and enlighten with progression", "title": "$m0K\u20ac\u00a5-FrEeWiSeMiNd /FWM", "publishedDate": "2014-08-25T07:18:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uXjW9tiBXE", "description": "Ice bucket challenge!

As the film begins, John Kimble (Schwarzenegger) and his partner Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) are in pursuit of notorious drug dealer Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) and his scabrous mother Eleanor (Carroll Baker). John learns Cullen is searching for his ex-wife and his little boy, and Kimble plans to nail them when they find the former wife, who is believed to have $3 million of Cullen's drug profits. John and Phoebe follow the trail to Astoria, Oregon, where they believe Cullen's son is attending kindergarten. Although the child and his mother have changed names, John hopes they can pick up some clues. By coincidence, Phoebe used to be a schoolteacher and the school board permits her teach the kindergarten class, but Phoebe gets food poisoning and John is forced to teach the six-year-old whippersnappers himself. Along with lighthearted gags with the kids and the pursuit of the drug dealers, John has time for a little romance when he falls in love with one of the teachers (Penelope Ann Miller), who ends up surprising him with more than love.\n\n\"kindergarten cop\",\"kindergarten cop clip\",\"kindergarten cop part 1\",\"kindergarten cop shut up\",\"kindergarten cop trailer\",\"arnold schwarzenegger\",\"lunch box videos\",\"pencil videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action comedies\",comedy,\"brian grazer\",\"ivan reitman\",\"joe medjuck\",\"gordon a webb\",\"sheldon kahn\",\"michael c gross\",\"authority videos\",\"childhood videos\",\"control videos\",\"classroom videos\",\"detective john kimble\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++27364,/m/0tc7", "title": "It's Not a Tumor! - Kindergarten Cop (6/10) Movie CLIP (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T10:06:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ucq-Ku4DUg", "description": "", "title": "Oxalis In House Manufacturing", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T17:57:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6udDtVfq2-I", "description": "Discovered this while Tinkering around, and it was profound enough that I made this video immediately.

In her most passionate novel yet, she brings us the riveting story of two sisters, and a love that illuminates life.\n \nYou won't forget Elf and Yoli, two smart and loving sisters. Elfrieda, a world-renowned pianist, glamorous, wealthy, happily married: she wants to die. Yolandi, divorced, broke, sleeping with the wrong men as she tries to find true love: she desperately wants to keep her older sister alive. Yoli is a beguiling mess, wickedly funny even as she stumbles through life struggling to keep her teenage kids and mother happy, her exes from hating her, her sister from killing herself and her own heart from breaking. \n \nBut Elf's latest suicide attempt is a shock: she is three weeks away from the opening of her highly anticipated international tour. Her long-time agent has been calling and neither Yoli nor Elf's loving husband knows what to tell him. Can she be nursed back to \"health\" in time? Does it matter? As the situation becomes ever more complicated, Yoli faces the most terrifying decision of her life.\n \nAll My Puny Sorrows, at once tender and unquiet, offers a profound reflection on the limits of love, and the sometimes unimaginable challenges we experience when childhood becomes a new country of adult commitments and responsibilities. In her beautifully rendered new novel, Miriam Toews gives us a startling demonstration of how to carry on with hope and love and the business of living even when grief loads the heart.\n\n*\"With warm thanks to Valentina Lisitsa.

There is a considerable amount of conflict in the minds of many devout individuals, the living souls, about the concept of Law \n\nWe so often think of the term on a 'Legal' level, associating it with innumerable restrictions and limitations, or peculiarities relating to our own cultural platform \n \nWe think of it as something found in great books, which have to be studied with emphasis on precedence, and all the elaborate machinery of Human jurisprudence \nBecause this is Law, as we have come to know it, the term Universal Law has some rather unfortunate semantic implications  \n\nWe think of Law perhaps as Just, but we are also inclined to think that it is Cold, that is something with very little consideration for the peculiarities and necessities of human beings, perhaps broadly protective, but often THE frustrating influence upon individuals \n\nSo we must have a larger concept of Law, we must take away from it, this tremendous emphasis of THOUGH SHALL NOT! Which seems so often to be of a prime importance in a penal code, we have no right to inflict our own codes upon a law, because that standpoint is unlawful and contrary to Law\nLaw, like a living relentless river, will always find its way\n\nLAW represents not only the Eternal Will of The Creator, for its creation, but also encloses within its concept and structure, the Other aspects of The God Head, Namely Wisdom, and Love.\n\nSometimes we think that these principles operate differently, but the wisest of mortals, have experienced within themselves, that Universal Law, is the greatest good, the greatest beauty, the greatest love, the greatest wisdom, a Man can know \n\nLaw does not exist to circumscribe, or limit the activity of anything.  \n\n\nLaw exists eternally, as always it has and always it will be so to permit and sustain the Eternal Unfoldment of life \n\nUniversal Law, well is forever protective, and it gives to man one tremendously important psychological security\n\nIt tells him that This LAW will preserve, perfect, protect EVERY CREATURE that is True to it \n\nAnd through being TRUE to LAW, Man attains all good things possible to him.  \nAnd therefore, a life lived in harmony with LAW is a good life, a kind life, a generous life, one thoughtful, and filled with understanding \nSo it is then ,from fear of LAW , which was perhaps Mans first reaction to the unknown limitlessness perhaps,  came respect for LAW later Admiration, then Finally LOVE of LAW, and perhaps in the most mystical sense Adoration\n\n LAW FINALLY BECOMES the BLAZING LIVING SYMBOL of the DIVINE POWER ITSELF, and the very GROUND OF LAW IS its own Lawfulness \n\nA Law is MEANINGLESS... if like Mortal Statutes, it is subjected to invariable variations and compromises  \n\nIF we could BUY or bribe Universal Law, there could be NO integrity in our World\n\nNow I can try and we can try harder  to define how we will understand and Stand under Law\n\nPerhaps we can say that Law, Universal Law,  IS THE DIVINE WILL IN OPERATION  IT is this INEVITABLE, PERFECTLY ENLIGHTENED PURPOSE. This INEVITABLE of the Universe, fulfilling its own Destiny   \n\nIts absolute sufficiency, by which The Plan, already conceived, sustained and perfected in the Divine Consciousness, unfolds   readily, and without deviation, into the full realisation of itself \n\n\nThe Law tells us, that ALL Disobedience, must ultimately be dissolved in obedience   \n\nSo Inasmuch as THE LAW itself, being inevitable and irresistible, it cannot be INDEFINITLY resisted", "title": "OCCUPY Autolift  Chester- Wheel Clamping Highwayman Signs ?", "publishedDate": "2012-07-28T09:59:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uvNnZ-hVHw", "description": "Premium Aquatic's Demo of the Hydor EkoMixo", "title": "Premium Aquatics Hydor EkoMixo Demo", "publishedDate": "2011-05-17T00:34:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uw_vztJshw", "description": "", "title": "Ordering in a Restaurant", "publishedDate": "2009-05-12T01:25:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uwmH3lNB5g", "description": "Videoclip der auf dem 1990 ver\u00f6ffentlichten Livevideo mit drauf war...\nhttp://www.dimpleminds.de", "title": "Dimple Minds - Blau auf'm Bau (offizieller Videoclip)", "publishedDate": "2011-07-29T16:05:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ux-CD2rWbw", "description": "Micky Tripathi discusses the potential stumbling blocks eligible providers in the second stage of the EHR Incentive Programs are going to run into.", "title": "Micky Tripathi on Stage 2 Meaningful Use Attestation", "publishedDate": "2014-01-21T16:41:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ux0-JGlb38", "description": "S\u00edgueme en twitter: https://twitter.com/Auron0\nS\u00edgueme en facebook: http://www.facebook.com/AuronPlayOficial", "title": "Mi abuela es Skater", "publishedDate": "2013-10-08T17:06:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uxWeV-OvBE", "description": "Using a Sonosite MicroMaxx portable ultrasound machine with high frequency linear probe it is possible to demonstrate the division of the sciatic nerve into tibial and common peroneal (fibular) nerves as the lie superficial and laterl to the vessels of the popliteal fossa.", "title": "Ultrasound views of the sciatic nerve (popliteal fossa)", "publishedDate": "2008-01-04T20:23:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6uxXb7q3ZqM", "description": "Go to http://bit.ly/1gjEcde for more info\n\nWhat are your characteristics, traits - personalities and behaviours?\nHow do you derive them? \nNumerology Life Profile uses Numerology by Date of Birth to calculate your character and traits.

Obey the law of the land by not crossing the borders of your nation with Ebola virus.\n \nJoshua, the general overseer of SCOAN is known for his claims of using divine powers to heal all kinds of diseases and disabilities, prompting sick people from all over Africa and the world to throng the church. Also, many foreigners who are majorly from countries of the West African sub-Region, which had already been infected by the Ebola disease, worship at the Synagogue church.\n\nThere was a reported case of Ebola in Nigeria, following the death of a Liberian man, Patrick Sawyer in a Lagos hospital, soon after, a pastor, Ituah Ighodalo, the Founder of Trinity House had shared a message on Facebook about a Pastor who cured Ebola in the name of Jesus. This sparked outrage as many misquoted him as saying he had a cure for the deadly disease. He has since come out to clarify his post which according to him was merely a message of hope and faith to remind people that with God all things are possible.\n\nMeanwhile, it was revealed yesterday by the Health Minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, that a doctor in Lagos who treated the late Liberian man had contracted the deadly Ebola disease.", "title": "T.B  Joshua Has A Message For Ebola Victims", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T17:23:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "6v04yYTY0fM", "description": "First map I've ever made. :] Been working on it for the last half a year or so, just started NetRadiant every once in a while and upgraded it.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby. The filmmaker will create his own distinctive visual interpretation of the classic story, bringing the period to life in a way that has never been seen before, in a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. \"The Great Gatsby\" follows Fitzgerald-like, would-be writer Nick Carraway as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz and bootleg kings. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super-rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles. \n\nMovieclips movie clips \"new trailers\" \"HD trailer\" hd trailers \"the great gatsby trailer\" \"great gatsby trailer\" \"great gatsby\" \"tobey maguire\" \"baz luhrmann\" \"f. scott fitzgerald\" \"english class\" \"high school english\" \"carey mulligan\" \"joel edgerton\" \"gemma ward\" \"romeo + juliet\" \"romeo and juliet\" \"moulin rouge\" \"amitabh bachchan\" zedison \"new gatsby trailer\" \"newest great gatsby\" Beyonce\u0301 \"Andre\u0301 3000\"", "title": "The Great Gatsby Interview - Carey Mulligan (2013) - Leonardo DiCaprio Movie HD", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T01:24:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6v4pb6JWGGk", "description": "Check out our new video about all the wonderful trips Three Rivers has to offer up in the gorgeous Millinocket, Maine area.

At least 107 people have lodged official complaints with the Corporation.\nComplaints: Viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of BBC period drama Jamaica Inn when it aired on Monday evening\nA spokesman for the BBC was unable to explain why the blunder was allowed to take place in front of millions of viewers, but promised to fix the problem for the remaining two episodes, which air tonight and tomorrow night.\nAmong the audience members who took to Twitter to complain were comedian Al Murray and Only Fools and Horses actor John Challis.\nMr Murray aired his disappointment via Twitter writing: 'Find out what happens next in Jamaica Inn by getting your ears syringed.'\nFormer Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips added: 'Did anyone else have trouble hearing BBC One Jamaica Inn?'\nMr Challis, who famously played Boycie in Only Fools And Horses wrote: 'Jamaica Inn LOOKS very good but I haven't heard a single word. Either the actors are mumbling or the sound track is faulty.'\nJamaica Inn is produced by Origin Pictures, an independent company with a host of big-name BBC projects to their name including Death Comes to Pemberly (BBC1), Hidden (BBC1) and The Crimson Petal and the White (BBC2).\nThe programme's credits name Martin Beresford as the series's sound recordist and Robert Farr as the re-recording mixer - who would be responsible for the final sound levels.\nNobody from the company was available to comment last night, and it was left unclear whether the BBC or Origin Pictures was responsible for the sound as it was eventually broadcast.\nA spokesman for the BBC said the corporation was reviewing the episode following 'issues with the sound levels.' The version of Jamaica Inn currently available on the BBC's iPlayer is not affected by the sound issues.\nThe drama, which was watched by 6.1million viewers, is set in 1821 against the windswept Cornish moors. It was directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, whose credits include Call The Midwife.\nThe three-part series follows Mary Yellan (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is forced to live with her aunt and domineering uncle following the death of her mother.\nNew role: The programme stars Downton Abbey actress Jessica Brown Findlay, [Mary Yellan], who goes to live with her aunt after her mother passes away\nA programme synopsis says: 'Life at Jamaica Inn challenges Mary's black and white perceptions of morality as she finds herself living among smugglers in a lawless land where no one is quite who they seem. \n'When she thinks she has witnessed a murder, Mary wonders at what cost she will stay silent.'\nTalking about the role, Jessica Brown Findlay recently said: 'It's not a fluffy girly story; it was so exciting and I loved the darkness of it. Mary is stubborn to a fault, she's very flawed but she also has a strong heart and a moral compass.' \nEmma Frost, who wrote the script, acknowledged the error to her Twitter followers and blamed a 'major sound problem'.\nShe said: 'No surprises here - I'm told there was a major sound problem for tonight's broadcast of Jamaica Inn - not surprised you couldn't hear it.'\nA BBC spokesperson told MailOnline: 'There were issues with the sound levels last night and for technical reasons they could not be altered during transmission. \n'We are adjusting the dialogue levels in episode two and three to address audience concerns so they can enjoy the rest of the drama and would like to apologise to those viewers who were affected.'", "title": "For God's sake stop mumbling: BBC admits 'issues with sound levels' after inaudible dialogue", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T18:52:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vMuWpV83S4", "description": "The snake was released and happily slid off into the bush.", "title": "King Brown or Mulga snake being caught at Cape Preston WA", "publishedDate": "2011-01-08T23:24:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vNSt7943u0", "description": "for more videos & updated news log on to http://www.tv5news.in", "title": "TV5 - Sarvepalli radhakrishnan jayanthi", "publishedDate": "2011-09-05T05:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vNp8AjflG0", "description": "Parakeets / Lovebird Farm in Alibag (Aakshi) at Kokan Bazar", "title": "Parakeets / Lovebird Farm in Alibag (Aakshi) at Kokan Bazar", "publishedDate": "2013-04-25T16:04:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vNsAHxJXwE", "description": "Shazam the video for more information on how you can win an exclusive personalised, signed and framed Tribute Tree poster, signed \"Tribute\" vinyl, signed CD and official John Newman T-shirt!\n\nDebut album 'Tribute' is out now: http://po.st/TributedlxYTd \n\nFollow John: \nFacebook: http://po.st/JNFacebook \nTwitter: http://po.st/JNTwitter\n\nhttp://johnnewman.co.uk\n\nMusic video by John Newman performing Out Of My Head.

MacDonald, Wesley Strick, James R. Webb\nFilm Description: Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear provided the director with a box-office success to follow up the critical success of the previous year's Goodfellas. After serving a lengthy prison sentence for a sexual assault, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) comes calling on the man who served as his public defender, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Max begins a campaign of harassment against the man and his family because Bowden buried a report that would have in all likelihood acquitted Cady of the charges against him. Bowden's shaky ethics continue in his personal life as he is considering beginning an extramarital affair with colleague Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), since he and his wife, Leigh (Jessica Lange) have had a difficult time coming back together since he has admitted to previous indiscretions. Cady infiltrates the family most insidiously by cultivating a relationship with the Bowden's troubled teenage daughte, Danielle (Juliette Lewis), who is all the more susceptible to Cady's advances because of her parents' problems. Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, the stars of the original film, have cameo appearances in this version of Cape Fear. De Niro and Lewis were both nominated for Academy Awards for their work in the film.\n\n\"cape fear\",\"cape fear clip\",\"cape fear trailer\",\"cape fear part 1\",\"nick nolte\",\"billy d lucas\",\"ken collins\",\"gar stephen\",\"martin scorsese\",\"chain videos\",\"dumpster videos\",\"pipe videos\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",drama,\"psychological thrillers\",suspense,\"steven spielberg\",\"robert de niro\",\"barbara de fina\",\"aggression videos\",\"guilt videos\",\"vengeance videos\",\"violence videos\",\"alley videos\",\"max cady\",\"sam bowden\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++8064,/m/06cgy,/m/0lkr7", "title": "Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are - Cape Fear (5/10) Movie CLIP (1991) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T12:18:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vOEPSDRQp8", "description": "The Puranas (Vedic histories) extol the month of Kartik as the topmost in the calendar.

From Preston we head north behind steam and run alongside the Lancaster canal, cross the River Lune and pass through Lancaster itself before enjoying views across Morecambe Bay. Leaving the main line at Carnforth and turning inland towards Clapham and Settle we skirt the beautiful Yorkshire Dales before running along the Ribble Valley through Clitheroe and back onto the West Coast Main Line to Lancaster where we break our journey. After a break of two to three hours we return, diesel hauled once again, across country to Cleethorpes arriving around 2215 (Scunthorpe around 2100).

Andrew is as influenced by Mick Ronson as he is Jimmy Page.\"\n\"I grew up listening to all the grunge bands,\" says Watt, \"but my dad always played me The Who, the Stones and Led Zeppelin so that became my music too.\n\"This kid is amazing,\" says Bonham. \"The first time we met I thought he looked like the white Jimi Hendrix. And he plays in the studio likes he's onstage!\"\n\nThe three-man line-up got together as California Breed for the first time last year after Hughes was introduced to the newcomer from New York by their mutual friend Julian Lennon. \"Julian was having an exhibition of his photographs at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in LA,\" Glenn recalls, \"and he said, 'You must meet this guy, he's the most fantastic guitarist -- who turned out to be Andrew.\"\n\nReconvening at Hughes' Hollywood home a few days later, \"The chemistry was just instant,\" says Hughes. \"We immediately wrote two songs together, Chemical Rain and Solo, both of which have ended up on the album. That's when I called Jason and said you've gotta come down right now.\"\n\n\"The energy when I walked in the room was crackling,\" recalls Bonham. \"I was so pleased. Glenn and I had not only really locked in as a rhythm section in BCC but we'd started writing together and we both really wanted to keep that good feeling going.\"\nIndeed, all 12 tracks on the as-yet untitled forthcoming California Breed album -- the band have signed a deal with signed a deal with the Frontiers label - have equal co-writing credits amongst the band. Recorded at Cobb's Nashville studio, \"Everything was done more or less live,\" says Hughes, \"including the vocals. Which is the reverse of how I've always done things\".\n\nThe end result is a sound that combines all the classic rock elements of BCC -- big, meat-cleaver riffs and heart-rending vocals -- but with a 21st century gloss that comes from working with someone as up-to-the-minute and talented as Watt (whose previous music can be heard at his Soundcloud page and on the track below, with video directed by Mick Rock).\n\nLook out for Midnight Oil, a raunchy Stones-esque rocker with breathless female backing vocals, deep groove rhythms and face-smacking guitars. The other breakout track is All Falls Down, the kind of spine-tingling pop-rock-who-knows-what that starts all colour and light and finishes all towering harmonies, back-arching guitars and epidemic-sized catchiness.\n\nThere are others but, as Hughes says, \"This, I promise, is going to be something special.\"\n\nGlenn Hughes: vocals, bass guitar\nJason Bonham: drums\nAndrew Watt: guitars\n\nProduced by Dave Cobb", "title": "California Breed - Sweet Tea (Official / New Album 2014 / Glenn Hughes, Jason Bonham, Andrew Watt)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T10:57:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vV-vqawNfE", "description": "www.BoxingInsider.com brings you inside the ring with Danny Garcia vs Zab Judah in this stunning HD footage ...

El primer europeo en entrar en Tombuct\u00fa fue el explorador escoc\u00e9s Alexander Gordon Laing (1793-1826), que sali\u00f3 de Tr\u00edpoli en febrero de 1825 con la intenci\u00f3n de estudiar la cuenca del r\u00edo Niger. Lleg\u00f3 a Tombuct\u00fa en agosto de 1826 y fue obligado a marchar pocas semanas despu\u00e9s, aunque no lleg\u00f3 muy lejos, pues fue asesinado en el desierto. Poco despu\u00e9s, en 1827, visitar\u00eda la ciudad el franc\u00e9s Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9, que lleg\u00f3 navegando por el r\u00edo N\u00edger disfrazado de musulm\u00e1n, y tuvo la suerte de volver para contarlo.\n\nTombuct\u00fa era el punto de entrada al desierto del Sahara y de reuni\u00f3n de los camelleros Tuareg, quienes la fundaron en el a\u00f1o 1100, durante la dinast\u00eda Mandinga.\n\n\"El oro viene del sur, la sal del norte y el dinero del pa\u00eds del hombre blanco; pero los cuentos maravillosos y la palabra de Dios s\u00f3lo se encuentran en Tombuct\u00fa.\", dec\u00eda un antiguo proverbio, en alusi\u00f3n a la principal actividad de la regi\u00f3n, el comercio. Los camelleros tra\u00edan desde el Mediterr\u00e1neo la sal y la intercambiaban por oro, frutas y pescado con las tribus negras que pose\u00edan dichos bienes en abundancia.\n\nDurante el siglo XIV se construy\u00f3 la muralla actual y la primera mezquita. Tuvo su mayor esplendor durante el reinado de los Askia (1493-1591), con m\u00e1s de 100.000 habitantes de diversas etnias: bereberes, \u00e1rabes, mauritanos, bambas y tuareg. Los habitantes estaban organizados en barriadas, donde se agrupaban, pero manteniendo activa la ciudad mediante el comercio.\n\nEn 1591, tropas mandadas por el sult\u00e1n de Marruecos conquistaron la ciudad y otras poblaciones de la zona. La expedici\u00f3n estaba formada en gran medida por moriscos, al mando de los cuales se encontraba un morisco castellano conocido como el Pach\u00e1 Joder, a causa de una expresi\u00f3n que deb\u00eda de ser habitual en \u00e9l. La mayor parte de estos soldados se quedaron en Tombuct\u00fa y se fundieron con la poblaci\u00f3n local. El dominio marroqu\u00ed dur\u00f3 casi cien a\u00f1os, al cabo de los cuales los sultanes perdieron inter\u00e9s por la ciudad dado que no hab\u00edan llegado a controlar las minas de oro y que resultaba demasiado caro mantener el poder nominal sobre la misma y sobre la regi\u00f3n en general.\n\nLa procedencia del oro con el que comerciaban las tribus negras era desconocida, y sumado al hecho que no se permit\u00eda la entrada a los no musulmanes, origin\u00f3 las m\u00e1s diversas historias sobre la ciudad.\n\nPero Tombuct\u00fa tambi\u00e9n fue famosa por su cultura, convirti\u00e9ndose en un centro de estudios isl\u00e1micos, gracias a las diversas facultades de su Universidad. Cuando la prohibici\u00f3n a los no musulmanes fue levantada, durante la \u00e9poca francesa, llegaron a su Universidad letrados y cient\u00edficos de distintos lugares, espa\u00f1oles, egipcios, persas y de todo el Magreb.\n\nEn 1893 la ciudad cae bajo la dominaci\u00f3n colonial francesa, no sin la resistencia de los Tuareg, que sufrieron grandes bajas. La ocupaci\u00f3n francesa se mantuvo hasta 1960, momento de la independencia del Sud\u00e1n franc\u00e9s, cuando tom\u00f3 el nombre de Mal\u00ed.\n\nLa mayor parte del \u00e1rea de la ciudad esta dedicada a mercados y espacios p\u00fablicos. Sus calles son de arena, estrechas y sinuosas.\n\nUno de los lugares m\u00e1s atrayentes para el visitante es su muralla, de unos 5 km, pero tambi\u00e9n la Mezquita Djigareiber (la grande), construida en 1325 por el arquitecto granadino Ishaq es-Saheli, a petici\u00f3n del emperador Kankan Moussa. Esta es la \u00fanica mezquita a la que pueden acceder los visitantes no musulmanes.\n\nTambi\u00e9n es apreciable la belleza de la Mezquita Sankore, convertida en universidad isl\u00e1mica; el Palacio Buct\u00fa y la Mezquita Sidi Yahia, recuerdos de la edad de oro de esta ciudad.\n\nA fines de septiembre de 2003, se termin\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de la Biblioteca Andalus\u00ed de Tombuct\u00fa, donde se albergar\u00e1n m\u00e1s de 3000 vol\u00famenes con manuscritos de tan rica cultura, pertenecientes en su mayor\u00eda a los siglos XV y XVI.\n\nLa desertificaci\u00f3n y la acumulaci\u00f3n de arena tra\u00edda por el viento seco \"harmattan\", destruy\u00f3 la vegetaci\u00f3n, el abastecimiento de agua y muchas estructuras hist\u00f3ricas de la ciudad. Despu\u00e9s de que Tombuct\u00fa fue inscrita en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en Peligro, la UNESCO inicio un programa para conservar y proteger la ciudad. En la actualida la ciudad m\u00edtica de Tombuct\u00fa es una finalista de las Nuevas 7 Maravillas del Mundo", "title": "TIMBUKTU-Mali", "publishedDate": "2007-05-16T19:08:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vXHKWXPjmc", "description": "Witty Lowry - Lay Here (Prod.

This person could always be depended on. GI's began to consider him the \"super GI.\" He was one who always got there first or who was always there when they left. I am, of course, referring to Kilroy Was Here. Somehow, this simple graffiti captured the imagination of GI's everywhere they went. The scribbled cartoon face and words showed up everywhere - worldwide. Stories (some even true) abound. \n\nHitler had a special group looking for Kilroy. Many Allied Commanders set out to stop the graffiti - an effort that was met with monumental indifference. Even so, it had to be done fast.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic of Kilroy, the graffiti. First it was simple and with an economy of time and effort! As you can see below, it could be placed on a wall with 4 simple strokes (5 with the optional hair.) \n\nThere was also the matter of 3 fingers instead of four made popular by Disney in the 30's. It has been reported that Disney went through a complicated analysis about whether animals, and which animals, appeared to have three fingers and a thumb. If you try, you can assume the forth is a thumb but the real thumb is actually vestigial and not seen on a dog print at all. It is, however, generally believed that Disney just figured it was easier to animate three than four-- I agree!.\n\nAs an aside, have you ever wondered why Goofy (a dog) could talk and have a pet but Pluto (also a dog) wore no clothes, couldn't speak, and didn't have a pet? Well, it is called the \"haberdasheral hierarchy.\" Neil DeGrassery Tyson described it carefully in The Pluto Files. The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet.

In this case, the blood volume is exerting the force on the walls of the heart as it fills. \n \nThe \"pre-\" and the \"after-\" are referencing the contraction.  (ie. Pre-contraction, after-contraction)\n\nThank you again, I'm so glad to hear from you\n\n/s/ Jon\n\n\nClick subscribe for more videos, share on Facebook if you think your friends could benefit from this one, and visit http://RespiratoryTherapyTutor.com for tons of value-packed tips, tricks, and shortcuts", "title": "Preload and Afterload in Simple Terms - Tutorial - Ejection Fraction and Stroke Volume Made Easy", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T21:41:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6veJtaInZs4", "description": "Chief Inspector Fay Tennet explains the role of Northamptonshire Police's force control room and talks about the use of the 999 'emergency' number and the 111 'non emergency' number.", "title": "Northamptonshire Police's force control room #FCR24", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T16:15:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6veLqbhT42M", "description": "In 2002 (not 2003) a total solar eclipse passed over outback South Australia.

A lady who had been unable to walk for 8 months was hospitalised. Dr Ryssia carried out three biopsies and send them to Dr Gloria Moraes head of Pathological Anatomy, who gave her medical opinion: terminal phase of scleroderma. Then Dr. Ryssia decided to give a lesson. Every Monday we had a lesson on cases that were not routine. And this was a very rare case. Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that is not frequent.  \n\nA very good lesson was given and I learned a lot because I didn't know anything about scleroderma, I knew it from books, but I had never seen a scleroderma patient. When the lesson finished, Dr. Ryssia asked the nurse to take the patient away. I understood, now was the time to say what could be done for the patient. You asked to take the patient away, so she couldnt hear. She said: It is true. There is nothing I can do for this patient.  \n\nI asked Ryssia: Will you pass this patient to me, so I can apply a technique which is not usual and is called auto-hemotherapy? She laughed and said: You know that I arrived from the USA in May. There I was a resident doctor in a clinic for all the cases of scleroderma from all over the USA. So the clinic was nothing other than a repository of scleroderma patients. There was nothing more that could be done. Then what do you think you can do?  \n\nI said: Look, I am going home right now to get the two works of Dr. Jesse Teixeira and Dr. Ricardo Veronesi, and you will see that the idea makes sense. I arrived there and I read the main parts of the two works and I asked : \"What now Ryssia?\". Ah, it has logic, it may work, it is worth trying\".  \n\nSo I applied the auto-hemotherapy, but as it was something new, to be done in a hospital, I used a huge dose. I took 20 (twenty) cc of blood and applied 5 (five) cc in each arm (deltoid) and 5 (five) in each buttock, because I had to produce a result, whether it was going to work or not, I had to reach a conclusion.  \n\nThe improvement was amazing. The patient, whose skin had the appearance of an alligators and was very hard, was heading towards a terrible death, that of asphyxia, because she would not be able to breathe anymore. The lungs cannot expand, because the body becomes as if were a wooden block. It seems unbelievable that 30 days later, on 10th October 1976, this patient could walk out of the hospital on foot.", "title": "03- Scleroderma - Auto-hemotherapy Dr. Luiz Moura - English subtitles", "publishedDate": "2010-01-02T16:05:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vwpiyk_7BA", "description": "for sale.. :)\n0857.112.555.27\nLokasi Bekasi Timur\n2,4", "title": "musang bulan - Igor - handukan sendiri sehabis mandi basah....:D (PAGUMA LARVATA LEUCOMISTAX)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-22T04:10:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vxHkAQRQUQ", "description": "Lisa makes a perpetual motion machine.", "title": "Homer Simpson - In This House We Obey The Laws of Thermodynamics", "publishedDate": "2012-11-09T14:04:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vxJhmC5Slk", "description": "Young Chloe Behrens sings with an adult heart and soul.", "title": "Chloe Behrens sings St.James Infirmary", "publishedDate": "2012-05-10T06:27:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vx_X4d8doA", "description": "I grabbed this when I was on my holiday in Mexico, it was about half 1 and I just got back in the room and I had a feeling my dad was outside so I looked through the spy hole and seen him\ud83d\ude06 when he fell he smacked his head off the wall hahaha he was smashed out of his head\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude39", "title": "My Dad Smashed", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T17:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vyCpLK7gd0", "description": "video uploaded from my mobile phone", "title": "Ambu", "publishedDate": "2012-06-25T11:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vyCrWZTUqo", "description": "The funkiest and the craziest joint from the Ohio Players...Enjoy it!", "title": "THE OHIO PLAYERS \"Funky worm\" (1972) - FUNK -", "publishedDate": "2012-03-10T17:04:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vyD2VJE180", "description": "", "title": "Snap2Strain Spill Stopper", "publishedDate": "2014-02-07T03:38:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6vyKnx8Apjs", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK:http://goo.gl/dHs73.\nBest New Movie Trailers - April 2014 HD \n\nCheck out all the BEST TRAILER MASHUPS: http://goo.gl/aKjSrH\n\nCatch up with the hottest trailers from the past month in our original epic mashup!\n\n\nMusic - Tidal Wave, Neon Storm and Foreign Land by the YouTube Library.\n\n22 Jump Street http://goo.gl/zJB8QR\nAll Chearleaders Die http://goo.gl/ms3c0u\nAs Above Below http://goo.gl/3UvGLR\nBears http://goo.gl/hZOdzx\nBlood Glacier http://goo.gl/Loi4tF\nBrick Mansions http://goo.gl/Dupq6W\nBroken Hill Blues http://goo.gl/JT1XUb\nCompound Fracture http://goo.gl/lhjEMR\nCowboys Vs Zombies http://goo.gl/eBYs55\nCurse of the Dragon slayer http://goo.gl/9yzk0L\nExpendables 3 http://goo.gl/ClNt9J\nFanie Fourie Lobola http://goo.gl/MyCUky\nFrankie and Alice http://goo.gl/xAaxJK\nGods Pocket http://goo.gl/Rxxpcz\nGone Girl http://goo.gl/GU6SBW\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 http://goo.gl/LPG4x7\nI, Origins http://goo.gl/QvhqIf\nJinn http://goo.gl/e2DaoS\nLa Vida Robot http://goo.gl/s19MN9\nLets Be Cops http://goo.gl/NBnOoY\nLucy http://goo.gl/XjBxHY\nMonkey Kingom http://goo.gl/N0HJwz\nNight Moves http://goo.gl/XS3B9g\nPing Pong Summer http://goo.gl/Ww1mh7\nPlatos Reality Machine http://goo.gl/dJ6n66\nRowdy http://goo.gl/glv4Hg\nStage Fright http://goo.gl/iuJfZe\nSugar http://goo.gl/FgvQ7L\nThat Demon Within http://goo.gl/i8BPpX\nThe Dam Keeper http://goo.gl/OIwQ7G\nThe Evil Within http://goo.gl/5wYdds\nThe Green Inferno http://goo.gl/kOO362\nThe Immigrant http://goo.gl/nL5C2y\nThe Love Punch http://goo.gl/EjUjpP\nThe Other Woman http://goo.gl/cMTHax\nThe Protector 2 http://goo.gl/ZdxjSX\nThe Raid 2 http://goo.gl/dBky9i\nThe Rover http://goo.gl/wtlahu\nThe Signal http://goo.gl/pq5CK8\nThe Water Diviner http://goo.gl/7tTn92\nTeen Mutant Ninja Turtles http://goo.gl/zdmLcB\nWish I was Here http://goo.gl/nRxxi8\nX-Men Days of Future Past http://goo.gl/35mF4u\nYves Saint Laurent http://goo.gl/oT91vn\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop.

(The yeast  cell is a mutant with an elongated bud. See note 1.) The amoeba is  expressing two fluorescent fusion proteins: GFP-PLCdelta2 (note 2),  which binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate and labels the  plasma membrane, and mRFP-LimEdelta (note 3), which labels actin  filaments. Actin filaments shape the phagocytic cup at its leading edge  and ring it in dynamic bands as it extends deep in the cell. The yeast  is too long, and eventually the amoeba gives up, as indicated by the  disappearance of the actin filaments. The yeast is promptly expelled  with remarkable speed and force, and the excess membrane is converted  into ruffles. The motile amoeba contacts the yeast anew, spreads along  its length until reaching the end, then tries again to engulf it, but  with no better luck. The similarities between a cell spreading on a  substratum and forming a phagocytic cup are evident. Methods: Living  cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal  microscope with standard components and a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x 1.4  N.A. DIC objective. Simultaneous fluorescence images (confocal) and DIC  images were recorded from a single focal plane. Scans were performed  every 3.89 seconds using a scan zoom of 3.5.
