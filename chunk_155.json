I'm one of the head decorators hear at Amanda Oakleaf cakes. I really enjoy working here and being a decorator, more specifically cupcake decorator. You can come visit us at our store front. It's at 1 Pauline Street in Winthrop, Massachusetts. And you can also visit out website at oakleafcakes.com. And today I'm going to be talking to you about cupcake decorating. So, I\"\"m gonna show you how to turn an ordinary freezer bag into a piping bag. Um, if you absolutely cannot get a piping bag, this is a good option. So the first thing you're gonna wanna do is take your freezer bag and you're gonna wanna cut off a very small corner. Start small cause you can always cut more off but you cannot put more bag on. So try and see if your piping tip fits. If the tip is out but you cannot push the entire thing out of the piping bag itself then you're tip fits perfectly. And this one fits pretty well so the next step would be to flip the bag inside out as you would do a regular piping bag. It's a little tricky because your piping tip is kind of in a weird spot. It's kind of in the corner. So just keep that in mind when you're filling it. So I would hold it from the tip. That way you know where to direct your frosting. With these I wouldn't fill them so full because they hold a lot less than a normal piping bag. So making sure that the opening to the piping bag is at the top. You're gonna wanna push your frosting down. It might be a little awkward to hold it but just make sure there's no air in there. So you're gonna wanna take your piping bag. That is how you turn a freezer bag into a piping bag. \n\n\"", "title": "Turning a Plastic Bag into a Pastry Bag | Cupcake Decorating", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T22:41:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lxYmAsZGtg", "description": "", "title": "Girugamesh - Drain 07-06-2014 live - Lido Berlin", "publishedDate": "2014-06-08T17:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8lxaNO5V06k", "description": "'Pre-order Olly's Right Place Right Time Special Edition CD/DVD from amazon: http://smarturl.it/RPRTSEamz\n\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/RPRTSEit\n\nOlly's Official Store: http://smarturl.it/RPRTSEos\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest Olly news here:\nFacebook: http://smarturl.it/OMfbook \nTwitter: http://smarturl.it/OMTwitter \nOfficial Website: http://www.ollymurs.com \nOfficial Newsletter: http://smarturl.it/OllyNewsletter'\n\nMusic video by Olly Murs performing Right Place Right Time.

Of course, some components are biodegradable. But other compounds are not, and can do massive damage to our environment.\n\nIn our home, there are toxic chemicals everywhere. Each room has its load of toxic cleaning products. Here are the top 5 toxic household products in our kitchen we should consider replacing by an environmentally-friendly version.\n\nWindow or Glass Cleaners:\nMany glass cleaners contain ammonia, which produces fumes that are highly irritating to eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and should not be used by people with asthma, lung or heart problems. Even worse, combining products that contain chlorine and ammonia can react with each other to form lung-damaging and potentially lethal toxic gases called chloramine. Some window cleaners also contain isopropanol that can irritate mucous membranes in the nose, mouth, eyes and ears. If swallowes, isopropanol can cause drowsiness, unconsciousness and death.\n\nAntibacterial Cleaner:\nAntibacterial cleaners are commonly used in the kitchen. We use them to clean things that come in contact with food (cutting boards, counter tops, etc). Disinfecting what comes in contact with our food help prevent contamination by harmful. However, antibacterial cleaners can cause more harm than good. It may contain ammonia, detergent, lye, cresol and phenol. Those substance are corrosive to tissue, can irritate eyes, and lining of nose, mouth and throat, damage liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and spleen, can cause central nervous system depression, severely affect circulatory system, and are suspected to cause cancer.\n\nDishwashing Detergent:\nThey contain cleaning agents with \"cationic\", \"anionic\", or \"non-ionic\" in their names. These products may irritate skin or make people more sensitive to other chemicals. The main ingredient usually used in these detergents is phosphate. Phosphates are a famous water pollutant. When phosphates are discharged in municipal waste water, they act as a fertilizer, causing overgrowth of algae. Too much aquatic plant life eventually reduces the water's oxygen supply, causing the death of fish and other organisms. Although many U.S. states have outlawed phosphates from laundry detergents and some other cleaners, they are still used in automatic dishwasher detergents.\n\nAll-purpose cleaner:\nAll-purpose cleaners may use many different kinds of ingredients, such as detergents, grease-cutting agents, solvents, and disinfectants. All-purpose cleaners can contain hazardous chemicals such as ammonia (see \"Window of Glass Cleaners\" section above), Ethelyne Glycol Monobuytl Acetate, Sodium Hypochlorite, Trisodium Phosphate. Depending upon the ingredients used, all-purpose cleaners can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. They are highly poisonous if swallowed and can damage heart, kidneys and brain.\n\nOven Cleaners:\nOven cleaners are used to help break up the baked on food stuck to the inside of the oven. The basic ingredient of oven cleaners is lye (either sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide). Lye is extremely corrosive, and can burn your skin and eyes.

The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically rather short-lived pioneer species widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern temperate and boreal climates. This tree is sometimes called \"The Watchful Tree\" because of eye-like impressions on the bark.\nBirch species are generally small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, mostly of temperate climates. The simple leaves are alternate, singly or doubly serrate, feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets. The fruit is a small samara, although the wings may be obscure in some species. They differ from the alders (Alnus, other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are not woody and disintegrate at maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody, cone-like female alder catkins.\nThe bark of all birches is characteristically marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and often separates into thin, papery plates, especially upon the paper birch. It is resistant to decay, due to the resinous oil it contains. Its decided color gives the common names gray, white, black, silver and yellow birch to different species.\n\nThe buds form early and are full grown by midsummer, all are lateral, no terminal bud is formed; the branch is prolonged by the upper lateral bud. The wood of all the species is close-grained with satiny texture, and capable of taking a fine polish; its fuel value is fair.\nThe flowers are monoecious, opening with or before the leaves and borne once fully grown these leaves are usually 3--6 millimetres (0.12--0.24 in) long on three-flowered clusters in the axils of the scales of drooping or erect catkins or aments. Staminate aments are pendulous, clustered or solitary in the axils of the last leaves of the branch of the year or near the ends of the short lateral branchlets of the year. They form in early autumn and remain rigid during the winter. The scales of the staminate aments when mature are broadly ovate, rounded, yellow or orange color below the middle, dark chestnut brown at apex. Each scale bears two bractlets and three sterile flowers, each flower consisting of a sessile, membranaceous, usually two-lobed, calyx. Each calyx bears four short filaments with one-celled anthers or strictly, two filaments divided into two branches, each bearing a half-anther. Anther cells open longitudinally. The pistillate aments are erect or pendulous, solitary; terminal on the two-leaved lateral spur-like branchlets of the year. The pistillate scales are oblong-ovate, three-lobed, pale yellow green often tinged with red, becoming brown at maturity. These scales bear two or three fertile flowers, each flower consisting of a naked ovary. The ovary is compressed, two-celled, and crowned with two slender styles; the ovule is solitary.", "title": "Birch tree How to draw a easy? \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e? \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430", "publishedDate": "2014-06-02T12:50:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8m86ElKLkDM", "description": "", "title": "JVP examination", "publishedDate": "2009-03-05T20:56:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8m876gGenhA", "description": "In de vroege ochtend, nog in alle stilte, komen we tot onze verrassing oog in oog te staan met maar liefst drie gemzen.

China expert, Ethan Gutmann featured the surgeon and other Uighurs earlier this month. Gutmann has been investigating organ harvesting\u2014a practice that is allegedly still happening in China today.\n\nA Uighur refugee and former surgeon, Enver Tohti, spoke with NTD about how he harvested organs from Uighur prisoners who were still alive. Tohti is the first surgeon to admit to personally performing live organ harvesting\u2014a practice that is believed to be used on prisoners of conscience in China.\n\nAt a recent rally in England, Tohti recounted what took place 16 years ago when he was asked to remove organs from an executed prisoner.\n\n[Enver Tohti, Former Uighur Surgeon]:\n\"At that time, my first instinct was that the person was still alive. Although he was executed, the bullet hit the right side of the chest. They did not shoot the left, where the heart is, but targeted the right, so the person would remain alive until after we remove the organs.\"\n\nAuthor and rights advocate Ethan Gutmann featured Enver Tohti and several other Uighurs in a report titled \"The Xinjiang Procedure,\" published in The Weekly Standard earlier this month. It's the latest report on the systematic live harvesting of organs by the Chinese regime, which Gutmann says began as early as 1991.\n\nAccording to Gutmann and others, like Canadian rights advocates David Kilgour and David Matas, the practice continues today on other groups as well. Kilgour and Matas published a report alleging that the Chinese regime is harvesting organs from live Falun Gong practitioners\u2014a spiritual group the Chinese regime has been persecuting since 1999. Gutmann, who has also investigated the allegations, estimates about 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners have been victims of live organ harvesting.\n\nFor Enver Tohti, these allegations are a reminder of a past he'd rather forget.\n\n[Enver Tohti, Former Uighur Surgeon]:\n\"After learning about the Communist Party's live organ harvesting, I realized that's exactly what I had taken part in, and I feel extremely guilty.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a 2004 American comedy-drama film directed, co-written, and co-produced by Wes Anderson.[2][3] It is Anderson's fourth feature length film, released in the U.S. on Christmas 2004. It was written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach and was filmed in and around Naples, Ponza, and the Italian Riviera.\n\nThe film stars Bill Murray as the eponymous Zissou, an eccentric oceanographer who sets out to exact revenge on the \"Jaguar shark\" that ate his partner Esteban. Zissou is both a parody of and homage to French diving pioneer Jacques-Yves Cousteau (1910\u20131997), to whom the film is dedicated. Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, Owen Wilson, Seu Jorge, and Bud Cort are also featured in the film.\n\n___\n\nIf you love film, You'll like this!\n\nWelcome to the home of Viral Film!

(But I don't believe for a moment that the Thames was named by the Irish, we Brythonic Celts have been using the name in one form or another since time immemorial and not once during that period did we ever send an emissary from Great Britain to Ireland asking for our river to be named by the Irish ... its quite a preposterous notion, really)\n\nPaul Cavill of The English Place-Name Society at Nottingham University:\n\"... the idea that the river-names Thames and Teme are related is right. The etymologies are those proposed by early scholars, ultimately going back to an Indo-European root temes- meaning 'dark' ... But generally, there is some similarity between calling a river Thames or Teme and calling a Welsh one Avon. In terms of etymology, Teme and Teifi are linked because -f- is the result of lenition of earlier Welsh/British -m-; the change is found in e.g. Tarvin from Lat-Br *terminus 'boundary'. Ultimately the etymological root is the ta-, te- one. So '(muddy) river' is the best etymology for the name.\"", "title": "The Thames Tagged", "publishedDate": "2008-01-12T21:13:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mIu0wH4OrQ", "description": "music: Naughty Boy-Think About it (Eagles For Hands Remix) https://soundcloud.com/eaglesforhands/naughty-boy-think-about-it\nmy instagram : http://instagram.com/easyneon\nmy soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/diana-karucinskaia\nProducts:\nMac Paint pot in Soft Ochre\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Lavish palette\nThe Balm Nude Tude palette\nSleek Ultra Matts V2 palette (teal color)\nL'Oreal Volume Million of lashes mascara\nRed Cherry false lashes(don't know the nr. exactly lol)\nClinique Bottom lash mascara\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Eye Covet eye pencil in Midnight\nBrushes:\nSigma P80  http://www.sigmabeauty.com/Precision_Flat_P80_p/p80.htm?Click=78135\nSigma E25  http://www.sigmabeauty.com/Blending_E25_p/e25.htm?Click=78135\nHakuhodo J5523\nMac 224\nMac 217\nHakuhodo J004G\nSigma E45\nSigma E30\nSigma E10", "title": "Seductive and Smokey eye makeup tutorial", "publishedDate": "2014-04-28T11:32:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mJPNM5vzQY", "description": "", "title": "atropine 026", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T00:19:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mJejUjDxXo", "description": "", "title": "LAHO K ANSO", "publishedDate": "2012-01-05T15:00:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mKMPGUY6zM", "description": "Interview with Natalie Dormer on The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.", "title": "Natalie Dormer - The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T13:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mL1rmlMDjQ", "description": "Thorsten Kaye wishing he was in Llanview.", "title": "Jamie \"No Ass Kisser \" Luner's First Day!", "publishedDate": "2009-04-24T12:23:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8mLQuxvriUQ", "description": "Hey Ho!\n\nF\u00fcr dieses Nageldesign braucht ihr Parfum (oder Alkohol/Desinfektionsmittel), Zeitungspapier und Nagellack.

Richard Njoroge took the bait and was nabbed while in the process of finalising the deal. The trap set for him required him to do away with tax evasion claims for a businessman amounting to about 120 million shillings, an amount that had however been cooked up.

In addition the application of BMS to the propriozeptive system leads to an ameliorated flexibility of the muscle. \n\nThe complex non-linear mechanisms of interaction of the various propriozeptive organs with the central nervous system and the exteroceptive vital parts under application of vibration, however, have not yet been clarified distinctly up to now. \n\nAdditionally the influence of BMS on the proprioceptive System leads to an improved stretching (lengthening) of the muscle.

The shapes differ from the almost cylindrical to the barrel. The manner of stretching the hide over the mouths and lacing also varies. It suspended from the neck, tied to the waist and kept on the lap or the ground, and usually played with wooden sticks. The left side is coated to give it a heavier sound. Drum beats are an integral part of Durga Puja.\n\nDurga Puja  also referred to as Durgotsava or Sharadotsav is an annual Hindu festival in South Asia that celebrates worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. It refers to all the six days observed as Mahalaya, Shashthi, Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami, Maha Navami and Vijayadashami. The dates of Durga Puja celebrations are set according to the traditional Hindu calendar and the fortnight corresponding to the festival is called Devi Paksha. Devi Paksha is preceded by Mahalaya, the last day of the previous fortnight Pitri Paksha, ('Fortnight of the Forefathers'), and is ended on Kojagori Lokkhi Puja.\n\nDurga Puja is widely celebrated in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Tripura and West Bengal, where it is a five-day annual holiday. In West Bengal and Tripura, which has a majority of Bengali Hindus, it is the biggest festival of the year. Not only is it the biggest Hindu festival celebrated throughout the state, it is also the most significant socio-cultural event in Bengali society. Apart from eastern India, Durga Puja is also celebrated in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Durga Puja is also celebrated as a major festival in Nepal and in Bangladesh all over the places of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra and other major places and all the villages of Bangladesh where the 20% population is Hindu.3 day National Holiday is being declared and most of the educational institutions remain closed as it is one of the major national festival also in Bangladesh which is widely celebrated and peoples from all religion participate in the program.\n\nThe prominence of Durga Puja increased gradually during the British Raj in Bengal. After the Hindu reformists identified Durga with India, she became an icon for the Indian independence movement. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the tradition of Baroyari or Community Puja was popularised due to this. After independence, Durga Puja became one of the largest celebrated festivals in the whole world.\n\nDurga Puja also includes the worship of Shiva, who is Durga's consort (Durga is an aspect of Goddess Parvati), in addition to Lakshmi, Saraswati with Ganesha and Kartikeya, who are considered to be Durga's children. Worship of mother nature is done, through nine types of plant (called \"Kala Bou\"), including a plantain (banana) tree, which represent nine divine forms of Goddess Durga. Modern traditions have come to include the display of decorated pandals and artistically depicted idols (murti) of Durga, exchange of Vijaya greetings and publication of Puja Annuals.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "redneck eats a living octopus in korea with his obese girlfriend", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:30:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nAGPFNlZW0", "description": "This is a quick video on how to unlock the 2 last characters lars and Minato.

Aus den sternf\u00f6rmigen, recht unscheinbaren Bl\u00fcten entwickeln sich h\u00fcbsche, aber ungenie\u00dfbare Beeren. Im Handel werden die Pflanzen ab dem sp\u00e4ten Sommer angeboten, zu dieser Zeit f\u00e4rben sich die Beeren orangerot. Nach einigen Monaten, wenn die Beeren der Solanum einschrumpfen und abfallen, wirft die Pflanze gew\u00f6hnlich weg. Es ist aber auch m\u00f6glich, Solanum \u00fcber das folgende Jahr weiterzukultivieren. Bei der richtigen Pflege bl\u00fchen die Solanum und tragen auch im darauffolgenden Jahr Fr\u00fcchte, besonders wenn man sie in den Sommermonaten ins Freie stellt.\n\nSolanum capsicastrum w\u00e4chst mit leicht behaarten, am Rand etwas gewellten, l\u00e4nglich-lanzettlichen Bl\u00e4ttern. Die wei\u00dfen Bl\u00fcten mit ihren orangegelben Staubgef\u00e4\u00dfen bilden sich in Trauben an 2 bis 3  cm langen Stielen in den Blattachseln. Die etwa 2 cm durchmessenden runden Beeren bilden sich im sp\u00e4ten Sommer aus.

In this series of videos I will present to you the questions that I find most suitable for an IQ Test. Can you solve all of them? Are they to easy for you or are they too hard? This can give some indication of how high your IQ is. Of course it is no concise IQ test (which would take several hundred questions and would have to be timed), but it is good to start you of. And of course the questions are fun. :)\n\nHere are all the questions written out:\n\n1. Which one of the five choices makes the best comparison? Finger is to Hand as Leaf is to:\n2. Choose the number that is 1/4 of 1/2 of 1/5 of 200:\n3. John needs 13 bottles of water from the store. John can only carry 3 at a time. What's the minimum number of trips John needs to make to the store?\n4. Choose the word most similar to \u201eTrustworthy\":\nResolute     Tenacity    Relevant   Insolent    Reliable\n5. Which number should come next in the series? 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - ...\n\nI hope you will be able to find this video under: \"IQ Test\", intelligence test, my IQ etc.\n\nPlease let me know how well you did by leaving a comment.

Clement Stone, was once described as an \"inverse paranoid.\" Now what does that mean? It means, that instead of believing the world was plotting to do him harm, he actually chose to believe the world was always plotting to do him good. So, instead of seeing every difficult or challenging event as negative, he saw it for what it could be -- something that was meant to enrich him, empower him or advance his causes.\n\nImagine how much easier it would be to succeed in life if you were constantly expecting the world to support you and bring you opportunity. Now successful people do just that -- they look for the opportunity in everything, no matter how negative or challenging it might seem.\n\nSo, if you take the approach that everyone and everything that shows up in your life is there for a reason -- and that the universe is moving you toward your ultimate destiny for learning, for growth, and for achievement, you will begin to see very event -- no matter how difficult or challenging -- as an opportunity for enrichment and advancement in your life.\n\nSo make a small sign or poster with the words \"What's the opportunity that this is?\" and then place it on your desk or above your computer, or on your bathroom mirror, so you will constantly be reminded to look for the good in every event.\n\nYou might also want to start each day by repeating the phrase. \"I believe the world is plotting to do me good today. I can't wait to see what it is.\" \n\nAnd then look for the opportunities and miracles to unfold...because they will!\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIt doesn't matter if your goals are to be the top sales person in your company, become a leading architect, lose weight, become a better parent, increase confidence, buy your dream home or make millions of dollars - Jack Canfield can help you develop a clear, personal plan of action that will completely transform your life into exactly what you want it to be.\n\u2003\nIf you liked this video, you'll love Jack's life-transforming products, dynamic in-person events and free resources found at http://JackCanfield.com/blog", "title": "Become an Inverse Paranoid- Jack Canfield's Success Tip #5", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T18:18:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nJHJC6TWjU", "description": "From the DJ Q-Fingaz album \"Qllection\" on Goon MuSick.\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/qllection/id578140556\nCD at HHV.de: http://www.hhv.de/shop/en/item/dj-q-fingaz-qllection-300443\nUGHH.com: http://ughh.com/dj-q-fingaz-qllection/GM12003CD/\nBandcamp: http://snowgoons.bandcamp.com/album/qllection-2\nOr: http://obc-ya.com/de/snowgoons/96-dj-q-fingaz-qllection-cd.html\n\nInfo: http://www.facebook.com/GoonMuSick\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Qfingaz\nhttp://www.twitter.com/snowgoons\n\nCamera: Mark Andre Flierl https://www.facebook.com/mark.flierl\nEdited by: Christian H\u00f6hs https://www.facebook.com/christian.hohs\nMan of the Match: Even K. https://www.facebook.com/subdonline\n\nWE KEEP HIP HOP ALIVE!", "title": "DJ Q-Fingaz ft Masta Ace - Progression (OFFICIAL VIDEO) \"Qllection\" Album", "publishedDate": "2012-11-04T11:12:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nJNC2zV_G4", "description": "Hmm..

You can also add the kava to the bag first then pour in the warm water and let it soak in the bag. I thought of this method when I realized my hands were getting dried out and sore from constant nightly squeezing with the more traditional method. The end result of this method reveals a nice oily look on the surface of the kava drink. Every serious kava drinker knows this means the oil was successfully forced out of the root. With this strainer some of the smaller root pieces get through but probably 95% of the root remains in the strainer. That remaining amount will settle at the bottom of the kava shell or glass so you can just drink until you reach it but I drink this small amount of kava root as well.

At the beggining of April 2014 i was diagnosed with a rare disorder known as early PTLD (post transplant lymphoprleferative disorder; an early lymohoma,cancer) caused by my immunosupressive medications for post transplant. I applied to have a dream bedroom made by The Sweet Dreams Foundation; this foundation grants bedrooms to kids with life threatening illnesses like mine. It would be a dream come true if I could have mine because I have to stay a YEAR away from school and crowds so most of my time is spent in the hospital or in my room-however the sweet dreams foundation is located in Sacramento California and I live in Seattle which is about 900 miles away so the cost of travel is very expensive for them so they can't come over... We are trying to brain storm some ideas to raise a whopping TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS over the course of the next couple of months to pay for the amazing volunteers to get over here!

Brooke wrote the sonnet later that month, and by the end of the year had written four more to complete a sonnet sequence entitled '1914'. Preceded by an unnumbered sonnet (written in August 1914), the sequence was first published in the periodical New Numbers (number 4) in January 1915: The Treasure, I. Peace (below), II. Safety, III. The Dead, IV. The Dead, V. The Soldier. The images in the first four lines: of religious calling, inspired youth, waking with restored strength and refreshed senses, and the swimmer turning (away from filthiness) and diving into sparkling clean water are images of baptism and absolution that belong to the doctrine of \"muscular Christianity.\" Begun and practiced at Rugby where Brooke was born and raised, \"muscular Christianity\" was a late-Victorian public-school notion of cleansing and test of manhood afforded by getting out of doors and getting in the game. Some practitioners of this notion felt that the war was the way to cleanse society (and especially young manhood) of what they saw as the effeminacy of Modernism. The second quatrain could describe this reaction against Modernism. However, Brooke was also looking for a fresh- start for himself . He was: Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary, after frustrated affairs with Katherine Cox and Noel Oliver, and some near and authentic nervous breakdowns, all of which leads Martin Stephen to wonder if \"the war may have at last offered certainty and direction to someone [like Brooke] whose capacity to inflict injury on himself outweighed the damage he could do to others.\" As part of his clean break, Brooke lashed out especially against his former Bloomsbury friends: Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, And all the little emptiness of love! The end of the octave (\"And all the little emptiness of love!\") is the climax of the sonnet. But with the first line of the sestet, Brooke comes back to his theme of absolution and reinforces the dual meaning of the poem: Oh, we who have known shame, we have found release there, As we've seen before, \"there\" is both the war (in a very naively generalized way; as an adventure, as a purifying crusade) and Brooke's own state of mind. In the remainder of the poem Brooke resigns himself to the clean simplicity of (what he sees is) a soldier's life and fate \u2014 whether a soldier in war or a soldier of life. 'Peace' is a declaration of self- realization and self-determination. It is at once about conversion and autonomy. One of Brooke's biographers, Christopher Hassall, observed that Brooke \"celebrated in exultation this discovery of a moral purpose.\" The poem must be considered in the context of the war as well as Brooke's tempestuous personal life, which at the time of the poem, he was finally beginning to pull together. Brooke was a product of \"muscular Christianity\"; a pre- war poet, expressing the pre-war sentiment of cleansing just as poets as diverse as Robert Graves and Isaac Rosenberg wrote poetry in the early days of the war that celebrated this image of the \"Happy Warrior.\" Even Siegfried Sassoon's early poems display this idea of spiritual cleansing afforded by the war, for example his aptly-titled 'Absolution': The anguish of the earth absolves our eyes Till beauty shines in all that we can see. War is our scourge; yet war has made us wise, And, fighting for our freedom, we are free. Sassoon later explained: \"People used to feel like this when they joined up' in 1914 and 1915. No one feels it when they go out again.'\" Brooke never had the chance to become a true trench poet: he died from blood poisoning on April 23, 1915, two days before the Hood Battalion landed at Gallipoli. \n\nKind Regards \n\nJim Clark \nAll rights are reserved on this video recording copyright Jim Clark 2011\n\nPeace..........\n\nNow, God be thanked Who has matched us1 with His hour,  \nAnd caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,  \nWith hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,  \nTo turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,  \nGlad from a world grown old and cold and weary,  \nLeave the sick hearts that honour could not move,  \nAnd half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,  \nAnd all the little emptiness of love!2 \n\nOh! we, who have known shame, we have found release3 there, \nWhere there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, \nNaught broken save4 this body, lost but breath;  \nNothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there  \nBut only agony, and that has ending;  \nAnd the worst friend and enemy is but Death.", "title": "Rupert Brooke\" Peace\" Poem animation WW1", "publishedDate": "2011-04-15T07:00:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ngk9zTLgu0", "description": "", "title": "\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e21\u0e30\u0e40\u0e02\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07 \u0e01\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e16\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e4c 3", "publishedDate": "2009-03-20T08:45:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ngvyEbif_g", "description": "Using BiteFX to explain canine guidance", "title": "Canine Guidance", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T21:08:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ngy0HIiK0E", "description": "Congressman Bob Etheridge assaults a student on the street in Washington.\n\nThanks to youtube.com/StageRightShow\n\nFor more FAIL videos visit http://failblog.org", "title": "Congressman FAIL", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T23:32:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nhYqG4F5fQ", "description": "Hello!\nIn the original there is also a rhytm pattent added to chords, but it just didn't sound good when i was playing it, so i'm posting naked chords.\nHope this will help You in any way!\n\nCheers friends!\n\n\n\n\n\nbasses, bass centre,bass guitars, bass notes,guitar bass, bass guitar lessons learn bass guitar, learn to play bass, bass guitar learn, bass tabs books, free bass tabs, bass guitar video lessons,bass guitar notes, notes on bass guitar,bass chords,bass lessons online, free online bass lessons, online bass guitar lessons, free bass tabs,free bass guitar tabs,slap", "title": "Victor Wooten - Isn't she Lovely (Bass chords tutorial)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-15T23:12:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nhZmLDOUmc", "description": "The Bedsit Sessions 22.01.2014", "title": "Joel Williamson - Stranger (The Bedsit Sessions)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T22:04:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nhcnYcLT78", "description": "A 360 view of campsite #28 at Lodgepole Campground in Sequoia National Park.", "title": "Sequoia National Park, Lodgepole Campground, Site #23", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T16:04:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ni60BBSOsk", "description": "", "title": "msasa", "publishedDate": "2013-12-24T18:57:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8niLzXzT5X8", "description": "", "title": "How-To Prune A Wax Leaf Ligustrum", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T13:19:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nifaubw9VE", "description": "This video made by me for my Bibliotech Library Management system.\n\nvisit : www.supersoftcorp.tk\nMusic by : Power book trailer", "title": "Supersoft Bibliotech", "publishedDate": "2011-03-20T09:26:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "8nis1ACu4Fc", "description": "2014 New Scientist Eureka Prize for Science Photography finalist\nhttp://australianmuseum.net.au/eureka\nUnravelling a Basket Star, Charles Tambiah, Australian National University\nCharles Tambiah\u2019s striking image of a basket star, Gorgonocephalus sp., has been composed by \u2018painting\u2019 with micro-light to peel back layers of science.

Tomorrow they might disconnect our phones and internet, announce a state of emergency and kill us while the international community remains silent, upholding European values on paper only. People are dying for them in Ukraine, and will continue to die.\n\nCitizens of Ukraine, representatives of civil organizations, active participants in the peaceful protests on the Maidan (Independence Square) in Kyiv and across the whole country appeal to the international community, national governments, and international organizations to decisively intervene in the current situation in Ukraine in order to help Ukrainians secure peace and civil rights in this part of Europe.We need your help to stop this bloody, brutal and evil war, which criminal government authorities wage against their own people.\n\nThe response to the protesters' actions by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) Security Forces is outrageous. Police strongly violate human rights, secured by international conventions and Ukrainian legislation, particularly by using live ammunition and water cannons. At least five people have already been killed by sniper's bullets and torture by criminal thugs hired by the authorities to fight activists, and the fate of many others has not been determined. Hundreds of protesters were severe injured, among them dozens of medical workers and journalists, who have been intentionally shot by snipers from \"Berkut\" (riot police), mainly targeting their eyes. MIA Security Forces have kidnapped the severely wounded right from the hospitals, handcuffed, tortured and humiliated them. We ask you to note that despite the terror against protesters arranged by authorities all over country, and specifically in Kyiv, people's resistance, with only one exception, remains peaceful.\n\nIt has been two long months during which the government authorities of Ukraine have violently reacted to the peaceful protest of millions of Ukrainians. Partial radicalization of public attitudes in Kyiv is the outcome of brutal actions by police during crackdowns on the peaceful demonstrators on the 30th of November and 1st of December, absence of a response by the authorities to the EuroMaidan's demands, systematic repressions towards participants of the protests across the country, and adoption of illegitimate laws, that literally reify dictatorship in Ukraine. Violent resistance started when police blocked a peaceful protest against the abolishment of the rights of Ukrainians for non-violent protest, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and fair trial.\n\nChaos, that has been illegally shaped into new laws, formally enables the regime to use violence to quash the peaceful protest on Maidan. This will likely cause massive bloodshed and a declaration of a state of emergency. This scenario benefits Russia in its aim to spread violence to other regions of Ukraine. The continuation of this will lead to a new \"Belarus\" and \"Pridnestrovia\" on the border of the European Union.\n\nWe ask you to switch from declarations to urgent actions:\n\n-demand from the President and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to immediately stop the violence that has been carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Security Forces and hired criminal thugs;\n\n- come to Ukraine, assess the situation from the inside and mediate negotiations between government authorities and citizens of Ukraine in order to resolve the crisis;\n\n- send missions with observers to prevent the reification of the dictatorship, to protect fundamental human rights and to safeguard European democratic values in Ukraine;\n\n- impose personal sanctions on anyone who has been involved in violations of human rights in Ukraine; ban their entrance into democratic countries and freeze their financial accounts; start investigations on money-laundering.\n\nUkrainians are united in their vision of the future for the country, where everyone enjoys the safety of life, liberty and freedom from violence. We are a civilized European nation, that has been imprisoned by the gangsters in power. Yanukovych was elected as a president with limited authorities. Shortly thereafter he modified the Constitution of Ukraine using legally dubious means and usurped power. We didn't vote for him under these conditions.\n\nPlease help us!

The flowers are more than one inch in diameter, a deep pinkish violet, but rarely produce seed. However, it is easily propagated from roots and leaves, and is slowly clump forming.

This report, which seems nonsensical, might refer to calcium oxalate. This mineral is found in  Impatiens capensis and so is probably also in other members of the genus. It can be harmful raw but is destroyed by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet. : http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Impatiens+parviflora\n\n Listi A yfir \u00fatlendar pl\u00f6ntutegundir sem \u00f3heimilt er a\u00f0 flytja til landsins. : http://reglugerde2vefur.eplica.is/reglugerdir/eftir-raduneytum/umhverfisraduneyti/nr/17703\n\nVatnaburkni Azolla filiculoides, R\u00fassak\u00e1l Bunias orientalis, Vatnapest Elodea canadensis, Bl\u00f3ms\u00fara Fallopia japonica, Risas\u00fara Fallopia sachalinensis, Lo\u00f0f\u00edfill Galinsoga quadriradiata, H\u00fanakl\u00f3 Heracleum persicum, Bjarnarkl\u00f3 Heracleum mantegazzianum, Snuddul\u00edsa Impatiens parviflora, Hrossaf\u00edfill Petasites hybridus, Senecio inaequidens, Kanadagullhr\u00eds Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea og Spartina anglica.\n\nDavid Rudwick  - Gardens and Greenhouse  - West Lavington.", "title": "Himalayan Balsam - sk\u00fdtur fr\u00e6um \u00ed allar \u00e1ttir - Aldinskellur - Sumarbl\u00f3m", "publishedDate": "2012-09-28T10:28:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o6TpuUETsQ", "description": "International Bluegrass Music Museum's, ROMP fest brings out some of the best Bluegrass music talent.

The gorge runs south to north through a limestone ridge 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of Bristol city centre, and about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth of the river at Avonmouth. The gorge forms the boundary between the unitary authorities of North Somerset and Bristol. In the past, when Bristol was an important port, the gorge formed a defensive gateway to the city.\nOn the east of the gorge is the Bristol suburb of Clifton, and The Downs, a large public park. To the west of the gorge is Leigh Woods, the name of both a village and the National Trust forest it is situated in. There are three Iron Age hill forts overlooking the gorge, as well as an observatory. The Clifton Suspension Bridge, an icon of Bristol, crosses the gorge.\nThe spectacular scenery of the Avon Gorge owes its remarkable features to the amazing forces of geology spanning over 300 Million years. The gorge is famous for the shear amount of Carboniferous rock exposed over such a small area. These limestones and sandstones are teaming with the record of ancient life and it was this rich diversity of life that made the Avon Gorge the site of the first major studies into Carboniferous fossils. \nNot surprisingly, the 2.5km long gorge has been awarded the SSSI (a Site of Special Scientific Interest) title -- a reflection of the truly outstanding fossil flora and fauna, as well as rare modern day wildlife. \nMusic Fly Home by mesmo.", "title": "Avon Gorge Bristol UK", "publishedDate": "2010-05-30T14:35:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o8eubgMXxk", "description": "The gangster Capt predict and his side kick SQL Querier ball some dirty data to save the world", "title": "Captain Prediction Saves the world", "publishedDate": "2010-12-14T04:01:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o8rSeVX-ZY", "description": "Going into the Channel Tunnel on the Eurostar at 160 kph.", "title": "Chunnel In", "publishedDate": "2007-10-26T09:42:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o8sq6KISAo", "description": "Here is the first verse and chorus of our new recording, just to give a taste of the song as a whole. \n\nWe are going to actively start looking for new band members preferably another person who can sing and play guitar or keys. \n\nWe'll get the whole song up once the vocals have been done properly and the mixing down is finished.", "title": "The Predictability of Someone's Luck", "publishedDate": "2011-12-09T14:25:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o9DVSFUIew", "description": "performed by Zubeen Garg", "title": "Bosonto utsav nagaon", "publishedDate": "2012-07-14T08:27:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o9OMm5brwk", "description": "Prof. Dr. Kaan Aydos'un di\u011fer sa\u011fl\u0131k videolar\u0131n\u0131 izlemek i\u00e7in http://www.hemensaglik.com/video/doktorlar/prof.-dr.-kaan-aydos linkine t\u0131klay\u0131n\u0131z.", "title": "Prof. Dr. Kaan Aydos Klinefelter Sendromu Tedavisi", "publishedDate": "2012-12-16T20:11:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8o9SRERIJYA", "description": "A toyon tree is judiciously pruned to work as a shrub", "title": "Toyon in Grace's Garden", "publishedDate": "2012-01-15T02:41:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oAJq2EGJpU", "description": "Michelle Rhee joins biographer Richard Whitmire to discuss students' perspectives on change at Sousa Middle School in Washington, D.C.", "title": "Michelle Rhee: Students' Perspectives on Change (with Biographer Richard Whitmire)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-08T13:56:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oARLxXqYb8", "description": "Get an inside view of our laboratory as Dr. Jacqueline Gutmann and Jeanne Walters, Embryology Lab Director, explain the types of equipment and safeguarding procedures used during the course of lab testing at RMA.", "title": "RMA of Philadelphia & Central Pennsylvania: Introduction to the Embryology Lab", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T16:49:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oBLzu1aI7U", "description": "Please contribute to:  http://www.jp2mri.org/capital-campaign.htm", "title": "2014   Lou Gehrig Ice Bucket Challenge", "publishedDate": "2014-08-13T23:01:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oBNJyHTNjs", "description": "http://www.amazon.com/Nasal-Aspirator-Congestion-Phthalate-Guarantee/dp/B00CYSFLPA/ Nasal Decongestant Spray - A  snot sucker is a  protected and  practical  practical and  secure  way for  easing  infant's nasal  blockage.

Here we report a perceptual illusion of body-swapping that addresses directly this issue. Manipulation of the visual perspective, in combination with the receipt of correlated multisensory information from the body was sufficient to trigger the illusion that another person's body or an artificial body was one's own. This effect was so strong that people could experience being in another person's body when facing their own body and shaking hands with it. Our results are of fundamental importance because they identify the perceptual processes that produce the feeling of ownership of one's body...\"\n\nAll materials used for nonprofit purposes only.

When it comes to high-quality playback of computer audio, the software and hardware are equally important; if either is lacking, you can't expect optimal audio quality.\n\nWith its long history of developing both software and hardware that meets professional demands for quality, KORG was uniquely able to create this ideal music playback environment.", "title": "Korg DS-DAC-100m Compact Digital to Analog Converter Review | Full Compass", "publishedDate": "2014-09-24T22:21:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oR0BxP5KDE", "description": "AGICOM, distributeur en France de Telesis, leader am\u00e9ricain du marquage par Micropercussion.", "title": "Micropercussion Telesis BenchMark320 par AGICOM", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T09:46:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oR4ewWVQtg", "description": "Fresh pedicure and dangling sandals", "title": "Dangling black sandals", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T03:06:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oR5DdbGUgQ", "description": "I didn't harm him, i was just trying to impress krishna but looks like i don't have any chance to impress anyone in this world with my barking skills.

Such a professional will research each part of the arrest in order to verify that it was appropriately completed according to local regulations. The attorney will then start negotiations concerning temporary driving privileges, the client's bail, and additional issues of this nature.\n\nSometimes, the DUI attorney may petition for a postponement of the trial. This is often the case when the lawyer wants more time to build a solid defense for the person who was charged. When the case goes before a judge, the client is represented by the lawyer, whose goal is to minimize legal penalties.\n\nDrunk driving criminal laws vary depending on the area of the country in which the incident occurred. Drunk driving lawyers specialize in interpreting such laws, and usually have an extensive foundation of knowledge concerning how such regulations are enforced. After the legal professional is retained, he or she will study the details and circumstances surrounding the case in order to discover anything that can be used in a beneficial way for the client.\n\nFor a DUI - DWI Attorney in Pocatello call us today\n\nSometimes, a motorist has his or her rights violated by the law enforcement officer at the scene. However, this may not be something that the driver would instantly recognize, and therefore he or she might not realize that the charges must be dismissed. An experienced attorney, on the other hand, would notice this immediately, and subsequently petition for the removal of the charges. At the very least, the lawyer may be able to get the charge reduced, which is obviously beneficial to the client.\n\nIf dismissal is not an option, the attorney overseeing the DUI case will likely begin negotiations on behalf of the client. For example, the person's license may have been taken at the time of the arrest. An attorney can sometimes persuade a judge to allow the person to drive with a temporary license in order to go to and from work and conduct personal business. Most lawyers also attempt to ensure that bail is set at a reasonable amount, in order to get the client out of jail. They have done this before and know the best strategy to use.\n\nFor Top DUI - DWI Attorneys in Pocatello call us today\n\nWhen a court date is set, lawyers typically discuss options with their clients before they enter the courthouse. A plan will be developed with regard to how the process should be handled by the judge. During the course of the hearing, the attorney interprets evidence entered by the prosecutor. He or she will then try to disprove the validity of the charges, if this is possible.\n\nIf the judge rules that the defendant is guilty of drunk driving, his or her attorney will provide suggestions and advice with regard to an appeal. In the majority of instances, DUI charges can be appealed in a higher court. Almost all lawyers can advise their clients whether or not an appeal is a wise course of action.\n\nFacing DWI charges without the help of an attorney is never in one's best interest. This is due to the fact that legal matters can easily become complex and overwhelming for the average citizen. For this reason, those facing charges of this type should hire a DUI lawyer in Pocatello without delay.\n\nYou may also with to check with the law firm about their cost and fees to provide legal defence services. \n\nFor Top Rated DUI - DWI Lawyers in Pocatello call us today\n\nDUI Lawyer Pocatello\nDUI Attorney Pocatello\nTop Pocatello DUI Lawyer\nTop Pocatello DUI Attorney\n\nattorney, attorneys, best, charge, charges, cost, criminal, defence, defense, DUI, dwi, fees, firm, law, laws, lawyer, lawyers, rated, reviews, services, strategy, top, top rated\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oTepI1NLi0", "title": "DUI Lawyer Pocatello | Top Pocatello DUI Attorney", "publishedDate": "2014-08-13T18:34:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8oTvs-81gtw", "description": "Bothrops moojeni is a sort of jararaca of the family Viperidae.

However for marketing purposes, it seemed like a better idea to split the episodes and release it individually as the deadline arrived to build anticipation.\n\nRegarding the soundtrack, the ending of Episode 1 does match the beginning of Episode 2 so the music in this video should in essence be the complete song.

We are eventually told 'no' twice and our audience is over. That the responses are from Sam Scoggins's movie about The Unlimited Dream Company and the '90 questions from the Eyckman Personality Quotient test' give the film a different meaning, that you're being fed the results of a psychological experiment, while appearing to participate in one yourself.\n\nSIMON: This film manipulates footage from the Scoggins film and is just a little disconcerting. It's like being given a glimpse into a malfunctioning brain, with its psychopathology unashamedly on show, brandished like a weapon. Ultimately the synaptic process is unfathomable and the viewer, like all readers of Ballard, is left on the outer, able to only impotently guess at the intent, forced to fill in the dots herself...", "title": "Superego", "publishedDate": "2008-03-02T02:46:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ob-WI2kOLI", "description": "ATL FIGHTS AND FUTURE SERIES PRESENTED BY DELGADO PROMOTIONS AND MEZEREON MANAGEMENT", "title": "ATL Fights and Future Series", "publishedDate": "2012-07-17T04:35:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ob-x6F5vJg", "description": "Kampong Dames 1 speelde gelijk tegen Oranje Zwart uit Eindhoven (2-2).

Moller later managed to get the closed circuit television footage of the altercation with the help of a legal representative.\n\n\u201cIt was a very intimidating situation,\u201d Moller said in an affidavit.\n\nHe said he and his wife had stopped at the Steers at around 2:20am. While he remained in the car, his wife waited to place an order. There were a group of men who appeared to have been drinking whiskey on the premises.\n\nBy 2.40am his wife had not yet received their order of two hamburgers. Frustrated. Moller entered the restaurant and tried to catch the attention of wait staff to query the delay. He asked for a refund and to cancel the order.\n\n\u201cWhile I was looking in front me, I felt a heavy slap on my back. When I turned around, there was a person standing very close to me and who asked me in a very hostile way: \u2018Who do you think you are!?\u2019 He repeatedly asked the question and in between the questions, he called me a \u2018Boer\u2019.\u201d It was Malema.\n\n\u201cHe also started telling us: \u2018Get out! Get out!\u2019...  Julius Malema became more aggressive and started shouting. He started pushing me against my will and he tried to physically remove me from the Steers Restaurant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2026 explained that I did not want to fight, but Julius Malema\u2019s aggressiveness just increased. He started shouting louder and swore at me\u2026 During the shouting, I also heard him telling me: \u201cI will fuck you up!\u2019, \u201d Moller said.\n\n\u201cHe then pushed me hard. With this push I stepped back in an effort to maintain my balance and in the process bumped into the person behind me. The impact caused the person behind me to stumble. I kept on explaining that I did not want to fight. Julius Malema pushed me for the third time.\n\n\u201cHe also waved his finger repeatedly in front of my face and pointed with his finger at my face while he raised his voice to me. Some of the other men in the restaurant also waved their fingers in front of my face. The group that was standing there, started flocking together and pushed me around against my will. They mocked me and some of the men in the restaurant pushed me and slapped me on my back. At last my wife received the order and then they pushed me out of the Steers Restaurant. When my wife walked out of the restaurant one of the men put his hand on her back and also pushed her out the door.\u201d\n\nErnst Roets, Deputy CEO at AfriForum, said they had assisted Moller in laying criminal charges.\n\n\u201cThe incident sketches a clear image of Malema as a bully who regards himself above the law and his fellow citizens. We cannot allow public representatives to act like criminals without facing the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE\n***************\nSA BReAKING NEWS\nLINK : http://www.sabreakingnews.co.za/2014/10/23/watch-malema-restaurant-tussle-caught-on-cctv/\n\nTimes Live \nLINK : http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/10/23/malema-pushes-swears-at-restaurant-patron---with-video\n\nTwiiter\n*********\nCrime Watch\n@crimewatch202\n\nSA Comm Crime Watch\n@waterfallcrime\n\nJustice Project SA\n@JPSAorg  \n\nFACEBOOK\n*****************\nCrime Line\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Crime-Line/123311467697540\n\nCrime Watch\nhttps://www.facebook.com/crimewatch202\n\nIntelligence Bureau SA\nhttps://www.facebook.com/IntelligenceBureauSA?fref=photo\n\nIF YOU would like to have your facebook page linked here.Please tweet us or email us.\n\nVideo Submission\n*********************\nIf you have any videos for us at crime watch, email as on crimewatch202@gmail.com\n\nTAGS\n*******\ncctv\ncctv footage\nhijacking\ncenturion\nsouth africa\neff,\neconomic freedom fighters\njulius malema\nThief\nDurban\nSouth Africa\nShoplifting\nJHB\nEngen\netolls\ncrime watch\netolls\ncape town\nrobbery\nowner\ncrime watch\nsmash and grab\ncape town\nonly in africa\ntaxi\nANC\nFight club", "title": "Julius Malema's assault caught on cctv", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T18:01:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8op8hArid8s", "description": "More stuff with the new Jaguar :)\n\nThis is from the Gravity Demos..", "title": "The Groover - Smashing Pumpkins - Guitar Solo Cover", "publishedDate": "2011-07-07T18:48:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8opUqPbkfzk", "description": "En este corto v\u00eddeo podr\u00e1s practicar las semivocales y las vocales nasales del idioma franc\u00e9s.

Be prepared to survive a shooting rampage, just in case.\n\n\nStep 1: Run\nRun first; ask questions later. Don\u2019t miss your opportunity to escape by wasting time debating whether that noise was really a gunshot. \n\nTip\nIf you\u2019re running from a shooter, run in a zigzag pattern. He\u2019ll have a harder time hitting you, and the odds are even lower he\u2019ll hit a major organ or artery.\n\nStep 2: Barricade the door\nIf you\u2019re trapped in a building with a shooter, lock yourself in a room and barricade the door with heavy furniture. The predator is likely to move on to more accessible victims. \n\nStep 3: Find a weapon\nFind some sort of weapon \u2013 a pair of scissors, a letter opener, hot coffee, a stapler, a fire extinguisher. Even if you don\u2019t injure the attacker, you may be able to distract him or throw him off balance. \n\nStep 4: Take cover\nTake cover behind something sturdy, like a file cabinet or a metal desk. \n\nTip\nDon\u2019t make eye contact with or speak to the shooter. But if he talks to you, respond with an absurd question in the hopes of throwing him off guard. \n\nStep 5: Listen for reloading\nListen for the 'click' that indicates his revolver is out of bullets, or the metallic clang that means the empty cartridge of his automatic pistol has fallen to the floor. He\u2019ll have to pause to reload, giving you and others a chance to tackle him or escape. \n\nStep 6: Slow bleeding\nIf you do get shot, slow the bleeding by keeping direct pressure on the wound.\n\nTip\nIf you think you might pass out from blood loss, place a hard object under your body, just above the wound, and lay on top of it. That way, if you do lose consciousness, your body weight will keep pressure on the wound. \n\nStep 7: Fight back\nIf you find yourself unable to avoid a life-or-death struggle with the shooter, go for his most vulnerable areas: gouge his eyes with your index and middle fingers; jab his Adam\u2019s apple; or knee him in the groin. \n\nStep 8: Report odd behavior\nHelp prevent shooting rampages in the first place by reporting any odd behavior or threats to someone in authority.\n\nDid You Know?\nHomicide is the second leading cause of death on the job, after motor vehicle accidents.", "title": "How to Survive a School or Office Shooting", "publishedDate": "2009-12-08T13:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8otVsLgcuSE", "description": "A cell is extracted from the 3 day old embryo (8 cells.

Like other sunbirds, they are small in size, feeding mainly on nectar but sometimes take insects, particularly when feeding young. They can hover for short durations but usually perch to feed. They build a hanging pouch nest made up of cobwebs, lichens and plant material. Males are brightly coloured but females are olive above and yellow to buff below. Purple-rumped Sunbirds are tiny at less than 10 cm long. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding. Purple-rumped Sunbirds are sexually dimorphic. The males have a dark maroon upperside with a blue-green crown that glistens in some angles, bright green shoulder patch and violet/purple rump patch which is generally hidden. The underparts are whitish with dark throat, maroon breast band and purple/violet patch in the throat which is visible in some angles. The iris is generally reddish in color. In the Western Ghats, it can overlap in some areas with the Crimson-backed Sunbird but male of that species has reddish upperparts, a broader breast band and generally darker eyes. The female has a white throat followed by yellowish breast. The upperside is olive or brownish. The uppertail coverts are black and a weak supercilium is visible. The nominate form is found in Sri Lanka and has a more bluish violet throat whereas the Indian form flaviventris (two other proposed populations whistleri from Maddur in Karnataka and sola from Pondicherry are subsumed) has a more pinkish tinge.Their call is ptsiee ptsit, ptsiee ptsswit or a sharp twittering tityou, titou, trrrtit, tityou.Purple-rumped Sunbird is a common resident breeder in southern India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It is found in Gujarat to the west (possibly a recent expansion ) and extending into Assam (Hailakandi ) or Meghalaya  in the east. Records from Myanmar are not certain. This species is found in a variety of habitats with trees, including scrub and cultivation and is usually absent from dense forest.They breed through the year and may have two broods,but mainly during the monsoons. The nest is made up of fine plant fibres, cobwebs and is studded on the exterior with lichens, bark pieces, flying seeds and other materials. The nest is constructed by the female alone although the male may fly alongside her. The nest is lined with soft fibres from seeds of Calotropis.The nest is placed on the end of branch and the entrance usually faces a bush. Nests may sometimes be built close to buildings or under open porches.The female stays in the nest at night a couple of day before laying the eggs. The clutch consists of two eggs which are generally oval, pale greenish and white with spots and streaks, becoming more dense at the broad end. Sometimes, eggs may be plain grey without markings as well. When collecting cobwebs they are often seen at windows of homes. The eggs are laid mainly in the morning. The eggs are incubated by both the male and female. The incubation period varies from 14 to 16 days. The chicks fledge in about 17 days and continue to be fed by the male for a few days.They pollinate the flowers of many plant species such as Bruguiera, Woodfordia, Hamelia and Sterculia. They tend to perch while foraging for nectar and do not hover as much as the syntopic Loten's Sunbird. It has been noted that they maintain special scratching posts, where they get rid of pollen and nectar sticking to their head. When the flowers are too deep to probe, they sometimes pierce the base of the flower and rob the nectar. They sometimes visit open crop fields and take honeydew exuded by leafhoppers", "title": "Sun stoke to Sun bird  Leptocoma zeylonica   Help by  Vishawajit Patil Amravati", "publishedDate": "2007-10-12T07:30:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ozvvlxJu3A", "description": "Jerry AUTO", "title": "Jerry Auto Sales", "publishedDate": "2012-05-27T22:09:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8p-BeT-co4w", "description": "My channel: www.youtube.com/user/TheJayFrus", "title": "Tokio Hotel - Girl Got a Gun (Live @ l'Hotel de Sers)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T10:52:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8p-FffF36xk", "description": "Part 1: Introducing the Army Reserve.

Widely regarded as the fastest person ever, he is the first man to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time measurements became mandatory in 1977. Along with his teammates, he also set the world record in the 4\u00d7100 metres relay. He is the reigning Olympic champion in these three events, the first man to win six Olympic gold medals in sprinting, and an eight-time World champion. He was the first to achieve a \"double double\" by winning 100 m and 200 m titles at consecutive Olympics (2008 and 2012), and topped this through the first \"double triple\" (including 4\u00d7100 m relays).\n\nAlthough gaining worldwide popularity for a sprint double victory at the Beijing Games, Bolt has had more victories as a 200 m runner. While he had not won any significant 100 m title prior to the 2008 Olympics, he had won numerous crowns in the 200 m event at the youth, junior and senior levels. Further, at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Bolt completed a hat-trick of 200 m world titles by winning his third straight gold in the event. His 2009 record breaking margin for 100 m, from 9.69 seconds (his own previous world record) to 9.58, is the highest since the start of fully automatic time measurements.\n\nBolt's achievements in sprinting have earned him the media nickname \"Lightning Bolt\" and awards including the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (three times). He is the highest paid athlete ever in track and field. He has been called the world's most marketable athlete.

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.", "title": "New Short Trendy Haircuts", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T15:07:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pCL-HRQtGI", "description": "Video oficial de la Campa\u00f1a Orgullo Yucateco", "title": "Orgullo Yucateco", "publishedDate": "2012-01-03T00:36:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pCVVyzFmRs", "description": "Voici je vous montre comment faite des bonbon j'esp\u00e8re que se tuto vous pleras", "title": "Comment faire des bonbon :p", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T20:45:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pCvtjQvVDA", "description": "Apr\u00e8s les tubes ...ALADJI BE GAH, FOREVER YOUNG,l'artist de la chanson togolaise ETANE; revient avec une autre tuerie intitul\u00e9e (VIAGRA);une production de NKROUMAH AMOUZOU.d\u00e9gustez", "title": "ETANE BLEX VIAGRA", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T21:36:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pCx23gqc-I", "description": "", "title": "krakes do forro- Me da um beijo- Mucuna Maracana\u00fa 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T09:12:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pCzJvLfmXM", "description": "A lonely hand puppet laments love and loss and waxes philosophical asking the age old question, \"what do you do for the one you love?\"\n\nDirected by: Mark Watrous", "title": "Mu Meson -- The One You Love", "publishedDate": "2006-03-14T23:40:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pD6XjYyUuA", "description": "Riding on a Dominator along Bridle Track Monaghans Bluff towards Hill End in Feburary 2013.

Personally I prefer it this way on me.\n\nI am not too keen on doing natural hair videos due to various reasons, however I decided to upload this video, which I recorded back in August.\n\nDepending on the feedback this video receives (whether you guys like it or not) will either encourage or discourage me from making them in the future.\n\nMake sure to grab a few snacks and enjoy this video. \n\nI will love it if you guys share your natural hair routine with me, so that we all learn something new, regardless of your hair type.\n\n* I've been natural for 1year and 11months. :( My hair grows slowly, but I love it either way.\n\n* I've always had a fine thin hairline. \n\n* I have never straightened my hair since being natural but hope to do so one day.\n\n* I prefer to finger detangle because I feel that I have more control and a better grip with my hair. In addition to that I experience minimal shedding/tangling this way.\n\nIf you would like to know more about my natural hair, my experience so far, likes and struggles, be sure to watch my updated natural hair video.\n\nPrevious Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OR99FZ7no\n\nNatural Hair Update : Routine, Length Check, Struggles & Bloopers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMmExc2C_8w\n\n\nAnyway please do thumbs up if you enjoyed this video and would like me to do a head wrap tutorial.\n\nI shall speak to you guys in my next video.

Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the edge of the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. This species and the larger alligator snapping turtle are the only two species in this family found in North America (though the common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is much more widespread).\nCommon snappers are noted for their belligerent disposition when out of the water, their powerful beak-like jaws, and their highly mobile head and neck (hence the specific name \"serpentina\", meaning \"snake-like\"). In some areas they are hunted very heavily for their meat, a popular ingredient in turtle soup. These turtles have lived for up to 47 years in captivity, while the lifespan of wild individuals is estimated to be around 30 years.\n\nChelydra serpentina have rugged, muscular builds with ridged carapaces (though ridges tend to be more pronounced in younger individuals). The carapace (upper shell) length in adulthood may be nearly 50 cm (20 in), though 25--47 cm (9.8--19 in), is more common. C. serpentina usually weighs 4.5--16 kg (9.9--35 lb). Any specimen above the afforementioned weights are exceptional, but the heaviest wild specimen caught reportedly weighed 34 kg (75 lb). Snapping turtles kept in captivity can be quite overweight due to overfeeding and have weighed as much as 39 kg (86 lb). In the northern part of its range, the snapping turtle is often the heaviest native freshwater turtle.\n\nCommon habitats are shallow ponds, shallow lakes, or streams. Some may inhabit brackish environments, such as estuaries. Common snapping turtles sometimes bask\u2014though rarely observed\u2014by floating on the surface with only their carapace exposed, though in the northern parts of their range they will also readily bask on fallen logs in early spring. In shallow waters, common snappers may lie beneath a muddy bottom with only the head exposed, stretching their long necks to the surface for an occasional breath (note that their nostrils are positioned on the very tip of the snout, effectively functioning as snorkels). Snapping turtles are omnivores, consuming both plant and animal matter, and are important aquatic scavengers; but they are also active hunters that prey on anything they can swallow, including many invertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles (including snakes and smaller turtles), unwary birds, and small mammals.\nSnappers will travel extensively overland to reach new habitat or to lay eggs. Pollution, habitat destruction, food scarcity, overcrowding and other factors will drive snappers to move overland; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold sperm for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often some distance from the water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the nest with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The Common Snapping Turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; radiotelemetry studies have shown that some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter.  Although designated as \"least concern\" on the IUCN redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as \"Special Concern\" due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity.\n\nSnapping turtles have fierce dispositions; however, when encountered in the water, they usually slip quietly away from any disturbance. Snapping turtles have evolved the ability to snap because unlike other turtles, they are too large to hide in their own shells when confronted. Snapping is their defense mechanism. However, these turtles rarely bite humans; they usually flee when threatened.\nThe snapper is an aquatic ambush hunter, capturing its prey with its beak-like jaws.\n\nThe common snapping turtle is not an ideal pet. Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if picked up by the sides of its shell. A wild common snapping turtle will make a hissing sound when it is threatened or encountered; however, when in the water and unprovoked, they are fairly docile toward humans.\nIt is a common misconception that common snapping turtles may be safely picked up by the tail with no harm to the animal; in fact, this has a high chance of injuring the turtle, especially the tail itself and the vertebral column. Lifting the turtle with the hands is difficult and dangerous.", "title": "Snapping Turtle", "publishedDate": "2013-11-06T01:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pNwg80itps", "description": "Visual and sound effects for Ikas Falchion in Star Wars: The Old Republic.\nhttp://tor-fashion.com/2013/09/17/ikas-falchion/", "title": "TOR Fashion - Ikas Falchion", "publishedDate": "2013-09-26T18:22:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pO1oJPps1I", "description": "VISIT http://www.polijam.com/  FOR ALL THE TOP NEWS!!!\n---------------------\nFor more on this post: http://polijamblog.polijam.com/?p=13140", "title": "Jack Cafferty Rips Obama on Failed Openness Pledge: 'Just Another Lie Told for Political Expediency'", "publishedDate": "2010-01-06T21:50:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pOR_O-sHJ8", "description": "Sample New Canary Bird Aviary\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOR_O-sHJ8\n\nLook for new canary bird aviary models, its can be good idea for you.\ncanary bird aviary, new canary bird aviary, canary singing, canary, black canary, canary islands, canary song, singing canary, canary sounds, roller canary singing, canary birds, canary yellow, canary julz, bird sounds, bird canary, canary training, canary home security, birds singing", "title": "Sample New Canary Bird Aviary", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T15:17:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pObyOCl0Y4", "description": "", "title": "Kaos   Fratelli  Taviani  (da novelle di Pirandello)  1984 scena finale da brividi, fuga su Malta", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T13:49:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pOfeE0kkZE", "description": "", "title": "Abbreviation in the making", "publishedDate": "2013-07-28T03:35:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pOrNvUlkrQ", "description": "http://amoxil.tk", "title": "Generic Amoxicillin: For Bacteria infection", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T19:03:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pP6ShuIfmw", "description": "The longest of all living venomous snakes, the magnificent king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) has been the inspiration for a variety of myths and legends within its native range.

But, if a complication should arise, the team at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center stands ready to assist you with a variety of programs to meet your unique needs.\n\nSome more common factors that contribute to a high-risk pregnancy include being pregnant with multiples, diabetes, genetic conditions, history of premature births, advanced maternal age or any condition the mother or baby presents that could require high-risk care or fetal treatment. \nHigh-level targeted ultrasounds and screenings such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood typing and fetal echocardiogram can help diagnose fetal abnormalities and other high-risk pregnancy issues.\n\nIf your primary OB/GYN referred you to Ohio State's Maternal Fetal Medicine for advanced maternal fetal care, we will work hand-in-hand with your primary OB/GYN to monitor your care and make sure that you are receiving exactly what you need, when you need it.\n\nOhio State's Wexner Medical Center is committed to providing women convenient and comprehensive care for every stage of life. The latest \"America's Best Hospitals\" issue of U.S. News & World Report recognizes our gynecology/women's health program as being among the best in the country.\n\nWhen choosing treatment options, Ohio State considers the unique characteristics of each pregnancy and approaches a care plan step-by-step to minimize risks. Some of the TTTS treatments available are:\n\n\u2022Amnio-reduction removes excess amniotic fluid with a thin needle. This procedure has the lowest risk.\n\u2022Laser photocoagulation of the placental vessels uses laser energy to interrupt connecting blood vessels on the surface of the placenta, allowing each fetus to have its individual blood supply. This outpatient surgery is performed only at qualified fetal centers in the United States, such as The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. In fact, Ohio State's Maternal Fetal Medicine program is home to one of only a few specialists in the nation with the expertise to perform this laser surgery. This procedure has more risk, but studies show it may be more effective in treating the cause of the disease.\n\u2022Bed rest: Since a decreased level of activity is often recommended, bed rest may be suggested as a treatment. The recommended level of activity may change as the pregnancy changes.\nWhen experiencing a high-risk pregnancy you should select a facility, such as the OSU Maternity Center, that offers a Level III\u2014the highest level\u2014Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This means should your baby require special care after delivery, our team has been trained in the latest advances in neonatal care. You can take comfort in the fact that should the unexpected happen, our team is prepared.", "title": "High Risk Pregnancy - Ohio State's Dr Britton Rink", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T17:15:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8pSKlZ9fhQ8", "description": "http://www.undergroundworldnews.com\nThe FBI has sent about 100 agents to the St. Louis area to help deal with any problems that could arise from the grand jury decision in the police shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown.\n\nIn addition to the FBI, other federal agencies have also mobilized staffers to get to St. Louis today, sources told ABC News.\n\nFerguson Hears Plea for Calm From Michael Brown's Dad\nA decision by the grand jury is expected soon, but St. Louis authorities said today that the grand jury is still meeting.

Mahout placing the howdah on his elephant. The female elephant sits down obediently to have herself adorned with the seating pad... This is on the Hinauta plateau in Panna National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India.\n\nThe majestic elephants are the largest mammal on land yet they are peaceful and gentle creatures. There are two types of elephant species, Asian (Indian Elephants) and African. Asian Elephants are easily distinguishable from the African tuskers by their smaller size and ears, more rounded back and fourth toenail on each of their hind feet. They have thick, dry skin with a small amount of stiff hair, and are grey to brown in colour. The current worldwide population of Asian elephants is estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Listed as an endangered species, its the only remaining species of the genus Elephas mainly distributed in Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east. \n\nGenerally Elephants have poor eyesight, but they possess a  very good sense of hearing and smell. The lifespan of Elephants is awesome, having bigger brains and an amazing memory. They rarely live on isolation but mostly stay together. So when one animal detects danger, the whole herd is alerted. The major regions where elephants are found in India include the forests of Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Uttara Pradesh, Orissa, and Assam. It is estimated that there are over 28,000 Indian Elephants in India, including zoos and animal parks. The Indian Elephant is found across India in protected forests and in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Famous Indian Elephant reserves in India includes Periyar Widlife Sanctuary, Bandipur and Nagarhole National Parks.\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Master your camera in manual mode for full creative control. Learn about lenses, depth of field and shutter speeds. Follow Karl as he captures stunning landscape images and demonstrates the techniques step by step.\nOn this DVD you will learn:\n\n    * Creative Composition\n      By just applying some basic photography composition techniques your photographs can leap from the ordinary to simply outstanding!\n    * Understanding Light\n      Discover a whole new world of photographic possibilities by actually understanding the main types of light and their impact on your photography.\n    * Apertures & Shutter Speeds\n      If this has slowed you down in the past, worry no more. Karl walks you through these core controls of your SLR camera replacing any confusion you may have with an enthusiasm to get out there and begin experimenting in manual mode!\n    * How Cameras Work\n      Cameras, no matter how much they cost all work in roughly the same way. The great news is you really don't have to spend more on your equipment to achieve better photographs. By understanding the simple mechanics of how cameras work will help you realise how similar they all are and how you can get the best out of yours.\n    * Landscape Photography\n      Probably the most popular type of photographic theme, but what actually contributes to the perfect landscape photograph? Karl reveals all!\n    * Capturing Action\n      Keep the action alive in your photographs, it's not all about freezing the action. Applying some simple settings and a few professional photography tips will make all the difference.\n    * Optics, Lenses & Focus\n      Have you ever stopped to think about how your camera's lens affects your photographs? Discover how different lenses change the angle of view and how the resulting perspective can absolutely transform photography results.\n    * Depth of Field\n      If the photography text books have confused this for you in the past then prepare to get excited. Karl's clear teaching makes depth of field completely understandable demonstrating the crucial link between apertures and shutter speeds. This fundamental knowledge will get you exploring your creativity every time you take a photo.\n    * Using Your Camera in Manual\n      It's just like learning anything really! When you put all the building blocks together and with some practice, your photography will blossom and your skills as a photographer will quickly move onwards and upwards to the next level. Learn to ride that bicycle without the stabilisers!\n    * ISO and Resolution\n      It actually isn't that complicated. As you become more in tune with using your camera in manual mode, a basic understanding of ISO and photographic resolution will aid your understanding of capturing the best results in any given situation.\n\nFeatures of this DVD:\n\n    * 90 minutes run time\n    * 16:9 widescreen\n    * PAL (Standard) or NTSC (N.
