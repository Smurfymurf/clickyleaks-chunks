Die griechische Schicksalsg\u00f6ttin Atropos, \"die Unerbittliche\", zerschneidet den Lebensfaden und bestimmt die Todesart, in \"Atropa\" spielen die M\u00e4nner Schicksal: Agamemnon, der Oberbefehlshaber der Griechen im Trojanischen Krieg sollte Vater sein, Ehemann, Bruder und Schwager. Er ist zum Kriegstreiber geworden, der seine und die Familien des Feindes zerst\u00f6rt. Iphigenie, Klytaimestra, Helena, Hekabe, Andromache und Kassandra stehen dem M\u00e4chtigen gegen\u00fcber und mit ihnen ihre individuellen Geschichten von der Kehrseite der Sonne: Im Krieg hat der Einzelne keine Bedeutung, zerrieben zwischen Weltkonzepten und Eroberungsstrategien, zwischen Heldengefasel, Machtf\u00fclle und Machtmissbrauch, wird er zum Ohnm\u00e4chtigen.\n\n\"Atropa\" amalgamiert die griechischen Atriden-Trag\u00f6dien mit Reden heutiger Kriegsstrategen; fasst den hohen Trag\u00f6dienton mit der Rhetorik eines Bush oder Rumsfeld in Alexandriner-Verse. Entstanden ist eine verst\u00f6rende Klage \u00fcber die K\u00e4mpfe der Kulturen in der Antike und im Heute aus der Perspektive der Frauen, deren Lebensf\u00e4den durch die m\u00e4nnliche Kriegslogik zerrissen sind.\n\nNach der gefeierten \"Orestie\" setzt Regisseur Georg Schmiedleitner seine Ausein\u00acandersetzung mit der antiken Trag\u00f6die im postmodernen Gewand fort. Tom Lanoye, belgischer Theatermacher und virtuoser Vergegenw\u00e4rtiger archaischer Stoffe, ist ihm dabei kein Unbekannter: Schmiedleitner inszenierte Lanoyes \"Margaretha di Napoli\", einen Teil der gro\u00dfen Shakespearebearbeitung \"Schlachten\", und die deutschsprachige Erstauff\u00fchrung von \"Mamma Medea\" im Schauspielhaus. \"Atropa - Die Rache des Friedens\" wurde von den f\u00fchrenden belgischen Tageszeitungen zum \"St\u00fcck des Jahres 2008\" gew\u00e4hlt.", "title": "Staatstheater N\u00fcrnberg - Atropa", "publishedDate": "2009-11-25T12:07:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vlNuxqQKU0", "description": "Music video by Cartel De Santa performing Vato Sencillo.

If you find yourself experiencing flu-like symptoms, achy joints, brain fog and fatigue after meals, you likely have leaky gut syndrome.\n\nWhat's worse, since leaky gut syndrome causes systemic inflammation throughout the body, it puts your joints at risk for arthritic conditions and can worsen already existing arthritis.\n\nHow Can I Cure Leaky Gut Syndrome Naturally?\n\nIn order to cure leaky gut syndrome, you need to heal your intestinal lining by nourishing the cells that regulate the digestion of food, enterocytes.  A natural amino acid called L-Glutamine is the best nutrient to help these cells regenerate and is an important nutrient for maintaining muscle mass.  \n\nIf you want to learn more about natural treatments for leaky gut syndrome, please visit: http://thebetterinfo.com/leaky-gut-cure.htm\n\nRelated Videos:\n\u2605 Leaky Gut Cure - The Best Way to Heal Leaky Gut \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oWM18YiRHQ\n\n\u2605 Aloe Vera Juice for Leaky Gut Syndrome\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfa-WbzDeis", "title": "What Are the Symptoms of Leaky Gut Syndrome?", "publishedDate": "2012-09-12T13:28:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vqoLwTcGKk", "description": "Latest release from Richie Spice - I use the Herbs\n\nLike us on Facebook for the latest song releases: https://www.facebook.com/freedomfightersreggae\n\n(We do not own rights from the song)", "title": "I use the Herbs - Richie Spice", "publishedDate": "2014-05-03T07:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vqrzWGSMS8", "description": "Eagles RB LeSean McCoy shows how his change of direction and quickness can avoid a 700-pound collision.", "title": "Sports Science: LeSean McCoy (HD)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T17:20:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vqyD-Cw2js", "description": "The PowerMax 360 is a revolutionary piece of strength and conditioning equipment that brings a whole new meaning to functionality and specificity; as it allows the user to dictate what specific muscle group they are going to exercise and at what velocity.

This is because the treatment involves assisting the thyroid to heal, in either case. Those with hyperthyroidism should not use iodine, because it could overdrive the thyroid, worsening the condition.\n\nCuring thyroid disease requires a long-term commitment for a period of at least a year. Creating this problem took years of self-poisoning, so fixing it is neither quick, nor easy. Hypothyroidism medications are addictive, and the body becomes reliant on them, which is why the mainstream establishment maintains that people must take them forever. Those who have been taking hypothyroidism medications for years must slowly wean themselves from the drugs. Abruptly stopping these medications will result in extreme fatigue, and additional thyroid problems.\n\nTreatment Recommendations\n\nEliminate and discard all non-stick cookware\nEliminate Soy - Soy suppresses thyroid function, imbalances hormones, and it has been shown to cause goiters (an enlargement of the thyroid gland) in previously healthy individuals, which shows that it disrupts iodine usage.\nAdhere to an Alkaline Diet - This is extremely helpful when curing any chronic disease. Reference the Body pH and Disease article to guide you.\nBalance Estrogen Levels (Women) - Excess estrogen slows down the thyroid gland. This means eliminating birth control medications, increasing the fiber in the diet, and avoiding all non-organic meats. Growth hormones in meats lead to imbalanced hormones. Reduce dairy intake, because milk often contains lots of estrogen; primarily because cows are milked frequently during pregnancy.\nExercise - Find a physical activity that is fun, and do it often. We believe that exercise could half the cure time in some cases, and curing is not possible without it.\nHemp Fiber - This is a broad spectrum supplement and a mild laxative.\nL-Tyrosine - Tyrosine is a natural amino acid which helps the body produce its own thyroid hormone. This is also known to help with the depression, which usually accompanies hypothyroidism. Most naturopaths recommend that 500 mg. be taken 2-3 times daily.\nL-Arginine - Arginine is known to stimulate the thyroid and its hormones. It also improves immune function, improves fertility, and alleviates erectile dysfunction.\nIodine - The thyroid needs iodine to function properly, and lots of people now suffer from iodine deficiencies. To test yourself, place some iodine (we use 2%) on your stomach. Make a dot the size of a silver dollar (or twice the size of a British 50p). If it disappears within 12 hours, then you are iodine deficient. Keep adding iodine in increasing amounts, until it no longer disappears in a 12-hour period. This works due to the fact that the body absorbs iodine at the rate at which it is needed. Do not use povidone iodine and do not orally consume iodine. This is especially an important precaution for those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nAvoid all sources of fluoride - As already mentioned, fluoride suppresses the thyroid, and is likely to be the leading cause of hypothyroidism. Drink spring water, avoid soft drinks, use fluoride-free toothpaste, use a shower filter, and throw away non-stick cookware. Both coffee and tea naturally contain fluoride, so use iodine to compensate if these drinks are indispensable.\nEat a natural diet - To help the body to heal itself, remove burdens on its immune system. This means that all processed foods, artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, white flour, white sugar, table salt, hydrogenated oils, aluminum, high fructose corn syrup, and etcetera should be eliminated from the diet. Organic food is the ideal. Do not trust marketing that reads \"All Natural\", because this phrase is unregulated, so anyone can use it for anything. Read labels carefully.\nChlorophyll - Supplementing with chlorophyll provides essential copper, helps oxygenate the body, builds healthy red blood cells, and it overall assists with skin health. Chlorophyll is a safe method of orally supplementing with copper. Those who are using our Colloidal Copper Lotion are unlikely to need more copper.\nZinc and Selenium: Studies indicate that severe zinc or selenium deficiencies can cause decreased thyroid hormone levels. Never take zinc on an empty stomach. Brazil nuts are high in both zinc and selenium.\nCoconut Oil: Buy organic, cold-pressed, coconut oil from a health food store. Take around 1 teaspoon of it daily. You can also use it to cook with, but be warned that it smokes at low cooking temperatures, so it should only be used for low-heat cooking. Coconut oil speeds the metabolism, encourages production of the thyroid hormone, and kills candida yeast.", "title": "Tyrosine Benefits For Hypothyroidism Sufferers", "publishedDate": "2014-01-15T12:09:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2vstfob5AHM", "description": "A fun little game I came up with and played at New Year with friends that ended up with humorous results.

When defending any DWI case I need to get the real numbers to figure a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) range: \n\nAmount of alcohol, Type (percentage/strength) of alcohol, Time spent drinking, Food intake, Bodyweight, and Gender. Using a computer program I can determine to a pretty accurate degree a range of BAC within a given timeline (time period). \n\nSometimes the police (law enforcement) get it wrong, often they get it (BAC) pretty close. Without a real BAC number whose to say whether you were actually impaired or intoxicated by alcohol or other factors played into your bloodshot, watery eyes, incoordination, or poor driving? DWI defense begins with this BAC and picture of the total night or morning's choices.\n\nI am a DWI and criminal defense Attorney located in Ithaca, NY. My practice focuses on the Defense of DWI and personal injury cases in Tompkins County, Cortland County, Tioga County, Seneca County, Chemung County, Steuben County, Schuyler County, and Broome County. \n\nGo to my main website to receive my free book, \"How to Survive Your New York DWI Arrest.\" At my website is a link to my blog with hundreds of pages of articles, videos and information that I have written relating to the defense of New York State DWIs. \n\nEach county handles DWIs differently.

Even though (mostly) short clips are displayed here, we preserve the entire broadcasts in our archives - the complete programs with breaks (or however much is present on the tape), for historical purposes.

Two identities and the ever-present, very real risk of death.\n\nThat was the life of Morten Storm, a radical Islamist turned double agent, who's now lifting the lid on some of the world's best-kept secrets.\n\nHis life is the stuff of spy novels, and he talks about it in his book: \"Agent Storm: My Life Inside al Qaeda and the CIA,\" co-authored by CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister. Both men are CNN contributors.\n\nHe also recently sat down with CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson.\n\n\"I had these different names. I had different personalities,\" Storm said. \"I was Morten Storm, Murad Storm, Abu Osama, Abu Mujahid.\"\n\nHe was so trusted by senior al Qaeda leaders he once fixed one up with a European wife, all the while -- Storm claims -- working for Western intelligence agencies.\n\n\"For half a decade, I moved back and forth between two worlds and two identities -- when one misplaced sentence could have cost me my life,\" he writes in the book. \"Traveling between atheism and hardline Islam, English and Arabic.\"\n\n\"It's some kind of schizophrenic lifestyle,\" he said.\n\nGrowing up\n\nStorm's remarkable journey began rather unremarkably in Denmark, in a town called Korsor.\n\nIt's a place with plenty of places for a young boy to play and Storm remembers, fondly, his time in the forest and on the beach. He also remembers struggling with the absence of his father.\n\nStorm started getting into trouble early. As a teen, he committed armed robbery and got into fighting, feeding off the adrenaline of both.\n\n\"Boxing for me was a way of getting out my aggressions,\" said Storm, who didn't limit his fights to the ring.\n\nBy his 18th birthday, he'd landed himself in jail. After he got out, Storm joined the Bandidos, a biker gang, working as its muscle.\n\nHis life was going nowhere good -- and fast.\n\n30 countries pledge support for US-led fight against ISIS\nIraq wins pledge of military support against ISIS\nIslamic State crisis: World leaders pledge Iraq support\nISIS must be fought 'by any means necessary,' \n30 countries pledge support for US-led fight against ISIS\nCountries Pledge Support To Fight ISIS\nWorld Leaders Pledge Military Support To Iraq In Fight Against ISIS\nClues in new ISIS beheading video\nISIS Releases Third Beheading Video\nLatest ISIS beheading video offers key clues for US official\nWhen Was Steven Sotloff Beheaded\nISIS Video: Who Beheaded James Foley\nDavid Haines beheading video\nClues, to, the, Location, of, ISIS', Steven Sotloff, Beheading, Video,\nMore clues in new ISIS execution video\nUS Airstrike Targets ISIS Near Baghdad\nU.S. starts offensive airstrikes against ISIS near Baghdad\nU.S. Hits ISIS Position Near Baghdad in New Phase\nUS launches first 'offensive' airstrike on ISIS near Baghdad\nUS Airstrike Targets ISIS Fighters Near Baghdad\nU.S. Launches Airstrikes Against ISIS Near Baghdad\nU.S. airstrike aims at ISIS near Baghdad\nUS bombs IS near Baghdad for first time\n\n.::Dont For Get to Subscribe::.\n............THANK YOU.............", "title": "[HOT NEWS] Agent Storm, Double Agent Inside al Qaeda for the CIA - Sept 16, 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-16T04:55:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2w9ZO38rzaI", "description": "Mycenaean Palace, graphics Nikos Giannopoulos,\n\nhttp://mycenaeeng.wordpress.com/\n\n\u039c\u03a5\u039a\u0397\u039d\u0395\u03a3 & \u039c\u03a5\u039a\u0397\u039d\u0391\u0399\u039a\u0395\u03a3 \u0391\u039a\u03a1\u039f\u03a0\u039f\u039b\u0395\u0399\u03a3 - \u0395\u03a0\u0399\u0394\u0391\u03a5\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 - \u0395\u0398\u039d\u0399\u039a\u039f \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0391\u0399\u039f\u039b\u039f\u0393\u0399\u039a\u039f \u039c\u039f\u03a5\u03a3\u0395\u0399\u039f.

'Starting Right Now' is the diverse collab of Cerf, Mitiska & Jaren and UK singer Chris Jones.\n\nMay 2012 brought us the long-awaited debut album of US producer Matt Cerf and Shawn Mitiska and vocal lady Jaren Cerf. Fans of the talented trio had to wait 5 years to finally discover the world of Cerf, Mitiska & Jaren, and enjoy its far-stretching borders of musical blends. 'Give Me A Sound' also brought the mix of pop and prog-house, heard on 'Starting Right Now'.\nThe follow-up to the successful 'Witness' doesn't only feature the powerful vocals of Jaren, but also contains the warm, characteristic voice of UK singer Chris Jones. Known for his collabs with Armin van Buuren and Roger Shah, he makes a more than welcome appearance on the new C, M & J single. \n\n'Starting Right Now' has the warm melodies, catchy vocals and energetic flow to get you hooked in an instant.\n\nUkrainian producer duo Ost & Meyer provide a warm, flowing prog-trance remix, while Finnish duo Maison & Dragen enlight 'starting Right Now' with a prog-trance sound, adding a contagious and rocking vibe to the original. \n\nTracklist\n1.

He thought he was going to give the program just a quick try, but soon found it too interesting and fun to quit. In 2003, after gaining some experience, he moved on from trackers to sequencers and started spreading his tracks on the Internet under the name Byproduct. In 2005, he made his first live gig for the electronic music audience, and has since been performing in various events around Finland.\n\nNot restrained by genre limits or strict expectations, Byproduct tracks can be anything from ambient to psytrance or breakbeats, but his style is consistent and original, and easily recognized by the old video game influences. He combines good old tracker sound, c64-emulators and computer game samples with new technology, creating progressive tracks with plenty of content and detail.\n\nDJ:t ja artistit\nLineup-tiedot l\u00f6yd\u00e4t alta (huomaa, ett\u00e4 soittoajat voivat viel\u00e4 muuttua):\n\nTorstai (artistitiedot)\n01:45 - 03:00 Andy Piney [progressive/trance]\n03:00 - 04:00 Indigo [special c-64 dj-set!]\n04:00 - 05:00 Aegonox [psy]\n05:00 - 06:15 Calderone [ebm/industrial]\n\nPerjantai (artistitiedot)\n23:30 - 01:00 Roz [tech-house/house]\n01:00 - 02:30 Wiljam [breaks]\n02:30 - 03:30 Proteus [hardnrg]\n03:30 - 04:30 Glxblt [dnb]\n04:30 - 05:30 Tres [techno]\n05:30 - 06:30 Pasik [oldschool melodic goatrance]\n\nLauantai (artistitiedot)\n22:00 - 23:00 Takomo [breaks]\n23:00 - 02:00 Tauko intro- ja demo-compojen ajaksi\n02:00 - 03:00 Byproduct LIVE [psy/breaks with c64/nes/game influences]\n03:00 - 04:00 Nuance [dnb]\n04:00 - 05:00 Tyranoid/Strongstream LIVE [hard/acid/techno/nrg]\n05:00 - 06:00 Gr [psy/fullon]", "title": "ASM08 Ravet - Byproduct [psy/breaks with c64/nes/game influences] - part 2", "publishedDate": "2010-01-24T02:28:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2wajvDYS2ms", "description": "Perdu dans ma fiction \u00e0 m\u00e9langer la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ! tchek !

The most recent eruptive phase of the volcano began on 2 May 2008, and is ongoing. According to the Global Volcanism Program, radiocarbon dating of older tephra from the volcano suggests that its last previous eruption was in 7420 BC \u00b1 75 years.\n\nThe caldera rim reaches 1,122 metres (3,681 ft) above sea level. Before the current eruption, it was mostly filled by a rhyolite obsidian lava dome that reached a height of 962 metres (3,156 ft), partly devoid of vegetation. Two small lakes occupied the caldera floor on the west and north sides of the lava dome.\n\nThe translucent grey obsidian which had erupted from the volcano was used by pre-Columbian cultures as a raw material for artifacts and has been found as far away as 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the south and north, for example in Chan-Chan.\n\n\n\n\nChait\u00e9n \u00e9 um vulc\u00e3o localizado 10 km a nordeste da cidade chilena de Chait\u00e9n, capital da prov\u00edncia de Palena, na Regi\u00e3o de Los Lagos.

Paul Miller, Galt Niederhoffer, Christina Ricci, Trevor Short, Andrew Sugerman, Andrea Sperling, Fredrik Sundwall\nScreenwriter: Frank Deasy, Galt Niederhoffer, Elizabeth Wurtzel\nFilm Description: Fans of Christina Ricci will note that the saucer-eyed actress takes a big leap from deadpan-child and grumpy-ingenue roles with Prozac Nation, an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's bestselling book. Ricci puts her all into playing Lizzie, a self-absorbed Ivy League writer wannabe who alienates friends and family with her out-of-control mood swings and other chemical imbalances. Ricci is committed and convincing, but nothing she does ameliorates Lizzie's exasperating personality; spending 90 minutes around this person is an eternity of tantrums. Around to provide audience stand-ins are Jason Biggs, Michelle Williams, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, all of whom disapprove of Lizzie's self-destructive behavior. Jessica Lange, professional as always, is Lizzie's brittle mother. If the movie really did capture the sense of the zeitgeist suggested by its grandiose title, or if it carried some intriguing stylistic urgency that carried us into its depressive labyrinth, perhaps Lizzie's journey would be palatable. But the long delay between Prozac Nation's shooting (in 2001) and its emergence on cable-TV and DVD is all too easy to understand. -\n\n\"prozac nation\",\"prozac nation clip\",\"prozac nation part 1\",\"prozac nation full movie\",\"michelle williams\",\"erik skjoldbjrg\",\"cigarette videos\",\"drink videos\",\"telephone videos\",\"independent dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"social issue dramas\",\"avi lerner\",\"danny dimbort\",\"trevor short\",\"andrea sperling\",\"andrew sugerman\",\"galt niederhoffer\",\"lati grobman\",\"christina ricci\",\"ildiko kemeny\",\"r paul miller\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++255213,/m/01fx2g,/m/03mp9s", "title": "Prozac Nation (7/11) Movie CLIP - Real Love Is Total (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T13:00:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2wyHIdP1yRg", "description": "http://www.KrankTV.com - Pulvis Et Umbra - \"Implosion of Pain\" - Like this video?

What makes things even more complicated is that extreme stress can make it hard for you to recover from ED.\n\nYour erections depend upon flow of blood to your penis, your testosterone levels and nitric oxide secretion in your body. In addition to this, your brain plays an equally important role in the process of getting an erection.\n\nViagra changed the male enhancement scene forever when it was launched in the 1990's. However, such drugs can have a lot of side effects.\n\nHere are some simple and easy ways to help you get harder and stiffer erections without using drugs:\n\n1. Try Some Mangosteen\n\nMangosteen is a fruit that is abundantly rich in certain compounds that can give a boost to testosterone levels in your body. A high level of testosterone ensures better sexual function and libido.\n\nAccording to a study, mangosteen contains compounds that have extremely strong anti-estrogenic effects. What it means is that it prevents aromatisation of testosterone into estrogen in your body. Thus, it can help elevate your testosterone levels. Thus, this fruit is great for your erections.\n\n2. Try Pomegranates\n\nPomegranate is great for your sex life for many reasons. According to a study, it can help testosterone in men by as much as 24%.\n\nThe same study revealed that pomegranate reduced arterial plaque by 35% in men who drank pomegranate juice daily for 3 years. Thus, it greatly helps in improving blood flow throughout your body and to your penis.\n\nBut this is not all!\n\nPomegranates are rich in antioxidants and compounds that can prevent enzyme aromatase from converting testosterone into estrogen. Yet another benefit of pomegranate is that it can help boost nitric oxide secretion in your body. This is quite significant since nitric oxide acts as a catalyst in increasing blood flow to the penis by helping blood vessels dilate so that more blood can flow through them.\n\nThus, you if you want to get harder erections, begin drinking fresh pomegranate juice every day.\n\n3. Include Red Grapes in Your Diet\n\nRed grapes are another fruit that you must include in your diet to improve your sex life. These grapes are rich in polyphenols such as resveratrol that are great for your cardiac health.\n\nIt's important to note that a healthier heart means a healthier penis. Your erections clearly depend upon your heart's ability to pump blood.\n\nYet another benefit of resveratrol is that it inhibits enzyme aromatase from turning testosterone into estrogen in your body. By doing so, it helps increase your libido and erection hardness.\n\nFurthermore, resveratrol helps boost sperm production in your body. This helps improve your fertility. It can also give a boost to your semen volume so that you can enjoy powerful orgasms.\n\n4. Lifestyle Changes\n\nHere are some lifestyle changes that can help improve your sexual potency:\n\n1. Regular exercise is great for increasing blood flow to your penis.\n\n2. Managing mental stress also helps a great deal.\n\n3. It's best to quit smoking since nicotine and other toxins in cigarettes damage your arteries resulting in poor cardiac and penis health.\n\n4. It's also best to avoid drinking alcohol since it lowers testosterone in your body.\n\n5. Getting enough rest or sleep is also important since it helps reduce stress and boost testosterone in your body.\n\n4. Try Natural Male Enhancement Pills\n\nApart from the above fruits, you can also try natural male enhancement pills to get harder, stiffer and longer lasting erections.\n\nSuch pills pack in a powerful dose of herbal extract, vitamins and minerals that not only increase blood flow to the penis but also boost testosterone and nitric oxide production.\n\nSome of the most powerful male enhancement pills include ingredients like l-arginine, epimedium sagittatum or horny goat weed, tribulus or puncture vine, tongat ali or long jack etc.\n\nSuch pills are a perfect aid to help you better your performance in bed since they not only ensure harder erections but also help you gain better ejaculatory control so that you can last longer during intercourse.\n\nTop of the line pills are safe and free of all kinds of negative side effects.\nhttp://EzineArticles.com/8747891\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/wikimens\nhttp://youtu.be/2x0NTXzWaEI", "title": "Ways to Get Powerful and Longer Lasting Erections", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T14:50:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2x0hTTfLieQ", "description": "For more TV5 content, visit:\n\nwww.tv5.com.ph\nwww.facebook.com/TV5manila\nwww.twitter.com/TV5manila", "title": "Wattpad Presents: Poser Teaser 1", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T06:45:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2x11csMQpGs", "description": "Suscr\u00edbete a rioMoros: http://www.youtube.com/user/rioMoros/featured\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/paginaderiomoros\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/rioMoros\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/107578649218847686010\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/riomoros\nEstamos en http://www.riomoros.com\n\nM\u00e1s sobre LA FLOR DE SANGRE (Axclepias curassavica) en: http://www.riomoros.com", "title": "FLOR DE SANGRE: Asclepias curassavica (http://www.riomoros.com)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-19T10:00:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2x1S4USSf4k", "description": "View of Dhaulagiri and its icefall followed by Tukuche Peak, the Nilgiri peaks, Annapurna I, Fang, and Annapurna South.", "title": "Dhaulagiri icefall", "publishedDate": "2011-12-16T03:49:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2x1aOowhL_4", "description": "CUPON DE DESCUENTO:    YOUTUBE5\nCOMPRA AHORA - http://www.audioonline.com.mx/pioneer-avh-x4500bt.html\n\nEl Pioneer AVH-X4500BT es un autoest\u00e9reo de Doble Din con pantalla t\u00e1ctil de 7\" pulgadas con una resoluci\u00f3n de 800*480 pixeles, cuenta con Bluetooth integrado compatible con la transmisi\u00f3n de m\u00fasica, adem\u00e1s de manos libres para realizar y recibir llamadas.\n\nTiene la caracter\u00edstica MIXTRAX, una tecnolog\u00eda para darle vida a su experiencia de m\u00fasica en el veh\u00edculo.

The odds are astounding against you giving up if you do it alone.\nHaving a 95% failure rate is pretty depressing news isn't it?\n\nWell not any longer. I'm Richard Bergin  I'm an NLP master practitioner trained in the new Qs60 technology and I'm here to bring you some good news, no wait, fantastic news. With the Quit smoking in 60 system you can quit smoking right after your first one hour session, that's right, quit smoking in 60 minutes! Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? \n\nIt gets even better! As a Qs60 practitioner I guarantee my results. Not only do we promise that you will stop your smoking habit in only one, one hour session, we guarantee it 100%!  If you don't give up smoking after the first 60 minutes session you get a free follow-up session or your money back! \n\nYou heard correctly after just one short session you can be free of your smoking habit with absolutely no negative side effects!\n\nHow can I be so confident you ask? Because I and my colleagues have a 95% success rate. Remember the other highest rated procedures have a much lower success rate, and take months to go through.\n\nThat's 12 sessions or more which you pay for and guess what? There's no guarantee you won't be smoking at the end. So if you're one of the 70% you'll lose your money and have wasted all that time just to end up more dispirited and dependent  than ever before!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2xEOOKjlK8A\n------------\n\nUseful Links\n\nLA Quits | Helping LA County Quit Smoking and Become Tobacco-free\nhttp://www.laquits.com/\u200e\nIf you're ready to quit smoking, just call the California Smokers' \n\u200eGet Help Quitting - \u200eQuitting - \u200eNo Excuses - \u200eBreak Up With Tobacco\n\nGet Help Quitting | LA Quits\nhttp://www.laquits.com/quitting/get-help-quitting/\u200e\nQuitting smoking has so many benefits -- it will improve your physical health, ...

They saw a glow from the tube that seemed to emanate from the negatively charged plate called the cathode. Since scientists didn't know what the glow was they called it a cathode ray. There was debate over whether the cathode ray was a wave phenomenon like light or a stream of negatively charged particles. JJ Thomson effectively resolved the debate in 1897 by performing a clever experiment that determined the charge to mass ratio of the particles making up the cathode ray. He also showed that this same particle was in all different cathode materials so it must be a constituent common to all atoms. This changed our understanding of the atom from the previous billiard ball model to Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom.", "title": "Cathode Rays Lead to Thomson's Model of the Atom", "publishedDate": "2011-02-02T05:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2xKe05dsFNc", "description": "Bob's Red Mill employee-owners present their favorite toppings for delicious whole grain cornmeal pancakes!

This is jeopardising the sustainability of the tourism sector itself, upon which Goa's economy heavily depends.\n\nNew research by Tourism Concern and CSJP indicates that water for the luxury tourism sector is being prioritised over domestic and small-scale livelihood needs. For example, residents in the popular resort town of Calangute receive piped water for just two hours every two days. However, traditional community wells are becoming unusable due to pollution and over-extraction, forcing a growing dependency on inadequate public supplies and infrastructure. Meanwhile, nearby resorts boasting swimming pools and golf courses enjoy a continuous water supply. One 5-star hotel in Benaulim consumes up to 1,785 litres of water per guest per day, compared to just 14 litres per day by a neighbouring villagers.\n\nThe report also calls on the international tourism sector to take responsibility for the impacts of their activities on community water access.", "title": "Goa Campaign against Water Injustice.flv", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T08:04:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2xTXJHOWiGc", "description": "A Gentleman's Guide To Love And Murder is Broadways latest offering for anglophiles seeking comedy.

With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish (Jason Statham, who also supplies the film's voice-over narration) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), who join up with Mickey (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top (Alan Ford). In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia), who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol (Lennie James), the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi (Dennis Farina), freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York.\n\nsnatch.,\"snatch. clip\",\"lennie james\",\"robbie gee\",\"alan ford\",goldie,\"guy ritchie\",\"coffee videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime thrillers\",\"dark humor black comedies\",\"heist films\",mobster,\"united kingdom\",\"steve tisch\",\"matthew vaughn\",\"michael dreyer\",\"trudie styler\",\"peter morton\",\"angad paul\",\"sebastian pearson\",\"taha ali reza\",sol,vinny,\"brick top\",\"bad boy lincoln\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++220951,/m/04dtv3,/m/034jts,/m/09qds,/m/034js0", "title": "Six Pieces, Sixteen Pigs - Snatch.

El tallo se ramifica dividi\u00e9ndose en dos casi dicot\u00f3micamente. Suelen se glabros o ligeramente pelosos.\n\nLas hojas son alternas, pecioladas, de enteras a casi divididas, con el limbo cuneado y asim\u00e9trico en la base, de forma lanceolada a romboidal con el borde lirado y l\u00f3bulos irregulares acuminados. Los nervios los tiene claramente marcados y el color es verde oscuro. Tanto las hojas como el tallo desprenden un olor desagradable.\n\nLa flor aparece en las divisiones de las ramas. Es solitaria, con pedicelo corto, c\u00e1liz tubular con 5 l\u00f3bulos triangulares alargados y m\u00e1s cortos que el tubo; la corola es de color blanco a blanco viol\u00e1ceo, en forma de embudo estrecho (infundibulirome), con 5 l\u00f3bulos terminales alrgados. En su interior tiene 5 estambres con las anteras de color amarillento y el estilo.\n\nEl fruto es ovado, con pocas espinas, menos de 35,  largas y duras, dehiscente en 4 valvas.\n\nLas semillas son reniformes, ligeramente abolladas y de color negro en la madurez.\n\nEn la naturaleza se da en barbechos, cultivos de regad\u00edo y zonas ruderales. Es una palnta naturalizada en Espa\u00f1a.\n\nEn jardiner\u00eda no se suele usar aunque tiene su atractivo por el verde intenso y por la flor.\n\nSu reproducci\u00f3n es f\u00e1cil por semilla.\n\nAl igual que el resto de especies del g\u00e9nero Datura, contiene alcaloides como la atropina, hiosciamina escopolamina y otros.

Just spin the green knob to change the second-story scene from a hotel room to an outdoor water park, complete with a slide that goes out of the hotel and into a pool that you can fill with water. Spin the pink knob to change the third-story scene from a hotel suite to a game room with ping pong table and karaoke lounge. There is also a kid-operated elevator that makes a dinging noise whenever it reaches a floor. Kids can attach two Polly Pocket dolls to the elevator and watch the dolls spin around as they move the elevator up and down.\n\nThere are lots of accessories included with the Spin 'N Surprise Hotel, from a mini fridge and beds to a microphone and chaise lounges. Each piece is a Stick 'n Play accessory, which means the accessories have suction cups on their bottoms to ensure they stay in place even when kids are spinning around the rooms. This also means that kids can stick the pieces, including the Polly Pocket and Lila dolls, to any surface of the hotel. Stick the pieces in traditional spots or add a little comedy and fun to Polly's life by attaching her to the wall or a chair to the ceiling. The dolls' suction cup shoes can be removed.", "title": "Polly Pocket Spin N Surprise Hotel from Mattel", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T13:50:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2xyqrs6d_vc", "description": "V\u00eddeo do DVD ao vivo da banda Rainha Musical gravado ao vivo em Ivoti.

The TSH concentration then returns to its pre-pregnancy level in the second trimester and then rises slightly in the third. However, most of the changes still occur within the normal non-pregnant range. Clinical indicators are usually confounding due to symptoms of pregnancy that can mimic thyrotoxicosis such as nausea, vomiting, heat intolerance, fatigue, anxiety and palpitations. The presence of a goitre, especially in patients with a borderline iodine deficiency, can further confound the diagnosis. Graves' disease is the commonest cause of true thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. Where there is prolonged and intractable nausea and vomiting, Graves' disease should be distinguished from hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy and transient hyperthyroxinaemia of pregnancy.

Alternative Therapies For general questions about thyroid disease, and its treatment with natural thyroid hormones, read and post in this forum. Ok, so I am going to be seeing a DO in Cincinnati in early November. I found him recommended on one of the \"find an armour prescribing doc\" websites. I've been charting my basal temp for him, which makes me feel like at least he is already looking at my symptoms instead of only my blood though I understand he does take blood and use those results as well . At any rate, when I scheduled the appointment, I told the receptionist that I did have thyroid antibodies present in my last set of lab work, and she told me that it was likely that Dr. Cincinnati I'll just refer to him as that for now would want me to do some alternative therapies that have been shown to heal the autoimmune side of things. My question is, has anyone here had any of those therapies done? What therapies might they be recommending to me? I'd like to do some research before he barrages me with these things, so I am prepared. I am generally rather skeptical of \"alternative\" therapies, but I am to the point of just wanting to find something that works whether the FDA approves it or not. The most prominant one we seem to talk about on this forum is low dose naltrexone. The following information is provided in the. Easily Accessible Information topic, but I have posted it here, especially for you. There are a number of proposed treatments to reduce or eliminate an antibody attack on the thyroid.

A healthy pancreas does many important functions. If some functions aren't working, it can be rather serious.\n\nOne function is to secrete the hormone insulin into the blood. Another vital function is to produce and secrete an alkaline fluid that alkalines the stomach components prior to it travels into the intestine.\n\nIf either of these two vital functions is not working correctly, serious disease conditions result.\n\nThere are at least 22 distinct pancreatic enzymes, each with their own extremely targeted job.\n\nOne common pancreatic enzyme is a protease, which breaks down protein. Another common pancreatic enzyme is a lipase, which breaks down fat\nIf someone has a deficiency in pancreatic enzymes, significant wellness conditions can develop.\n\nQuality enzyme supplements can be extremely helpful in this circumstance.\n\nThere are two options:\n\n1. Take a supplement that is made up of animal pancreas fluid.\n2. Take a supplement that is made up of plant enzymes.\n\nBoth choices can offer significant benefit in nearly all scenarios.

Die Silberwurz ist ein winzig kleiner Strauch mit einer langen, faserigen Wurzel und einem stark verzweigten, dem Boden angedr\u00fcckten St\u00e4mmchen. Die Pflanze ist sehr widerstandsf\u00e4hig gegen die K\u00e4lte der nordischen Tundra und der Hochgebirge. Silberwurzen k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber 100 Jahre alt werden. Die sich nur wenige Zentimeter \u00fcber den Boden erhebenden Zweigspitzen einer Silberwurz bilden gr\u00fcne, lederige, charakteristisch gekerbte Bl\u00e4tter. Die recht gro\u00dfen, wei\u00dfen Bl\u00fcten sehen denen der Anemonen \u00e4hnlich. Die Fr\u00fcchte der Silberwurz tragen an der Spitze einen Griffel, der sich nach der Bl\u00fcte zu einer 2 bis 3 cm langen, wei\u00dfen, zottig behaarten Fluggranne entwickelt. Die Bl\u00e4tter der Silberwurz sind auch im Schweizertee enthalten, der sich besonders zur Behandlung von Koliken eignet.\n\nDie Silberwurz ist ein 5 bis 15 cm hochwachsender Spalierstrauch. Die gestielten Bl\u00e4tter sind ledrig und l\u00e4nglich geformt. Die Blattoberseiten sind gr\u00fcn, die Blattunterseiten sind wei\u00dfwollig. Die Blattr\u00e4nder sind gekerbt. Nebenbl\u00e4tter einer Silberwurz sind mit dem Blattstiel verwachsen. Die Bl\u00fctezeit der Silberwurz erstreckt sich von Juni bis August. Die 2 bis 4 cm durchmessenden Bl\u00fcten bilden sich einzeln auf langen, behaarten Stielen. Die Wurzeln dieser Heilpflanzen sind pfahlf\u00f6rmig und faserig. Die Silberwurz ist geruchlos, ihr Geschmack ist adstringierend.\nStandort / Hier findet man die Silberwurz\n\nDie Silberwurz w\u00e4chst In arktischen Zonen, in den Alpen, in den Karpaten, in der Tatra und in den Pyren\u00e4en.

This became a reality when the idea was passed by Soule, who recorded the 30-man choir and layered three separate recordings to create the effect of 90 voices. The language, Draconic, was created by Bethesda's concept artist Adam Adamowicz, and he developed a 34-character runic alphabet for the game.

You bring with you up to \u00a31,000 of goods and often their packaging is left in plain view in wheelie bins outside your homes. This in itself is an open invitation to thieves.\n\nOur officers will be working with the universities and other agencies to ensure you are given the correct advice to keep yourself and your property safe, but you can help yourself by following our advice and short videos.\n\nMany of your items will hold more than a financial value. Your laptop will contain music and photos, and for second and third year students, lecture notes and work towards your final grade.\n\nFor more information on student safety, like our Facebook page www.facebook.com/mcrstudentsafer\n\nThe page includes updates on crime in your area and features useful information and advice on how to stay safe. You can also get in contact with your local neighbourhood policing team for more information.\n\nYou can download the GMP mobile app for details of police meetings and surgeries in your area. Using the GPS navigation, it also features the student safe zones \u2013 these are areas where you can go to when feeling unsafe.\n\nStay Safe: In addition to the increased patrols in the student areas throughout the year, our teams will target known offenders and deliver safety talks to thousands of new and existing students urging them to be security savvy.\n\nNeighbourhood Policing Teams will also run surgeries on campus to ensure you know how to protect yourself and your property and so that you can get advice from officers.\n\nDon't forget, you can register any valuable property (e.g. laptops, tablets, smartphones, mp3s) on www.immobilise.com free of charge. This will help police to return lost or stolen items to their rightful owners and also act as a deterrent to offenders.\n\nLock me \u2013 1 in 3 burglaries are a result of an open or unlocked door or window\n\nKeep windows and doors locked\nLeave lights on when out to give the impression the house is occupied.\n\nDon\u2019t leave valuables on view.\n\nHave a new TV? Then don\u2019t leave the box by the bin\u2026 you never know who is watching.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got an alarm use it.\n\nDoes your house look secure? If the answer is no then speak to your landlord.\n\nHide me \u2013 keep all valuables out of sight.\n\nDon\u2019t make yourself an easy target \u2013 walk and travel in groups at night and arrange a place to meet in case anybody gets lost.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings and keep valuables out of sight\nStick to well-lit streets and avoid shortcuts such as alleyways and empty carparks.\n\nUse cash machines during the day when it is busy or get cashback in a supermarket. Put your cash away quickly and never write down your PIN.\n\nIf you think you\u2019re in danger or being followed, walk to the nearest student safe zone or a nearby bar or shop to call for help\n\nTaking a taxi - don\u2019t play taxi roulette.\n\nTake a taxi you can trust \u2013 use a licensed black hackney cab from a legitimate taxi rank rather than flagging down a random car.\n\nSome clubs and pubs will book a cab for you and let you know when it is outside. Take advantage \u2013 it beats standing in the cold!\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure ask to see the taxi driver\u2019s license before you get in the car. Legitimate taxis will have this clearly displayed in the vehicle.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather get the bus then check the times ahead and stick together.\n\nSome halls of residences put on buses from and to venues. Find out if there is one running \u2013 it\u2019ll save you money and keeping you safe.\n\nSLURP: Keep your drink with you at all times and never leave it unattended.\n\nDon\u2019t accept drinks from strangers. We all love a free drink but would it taste so good knowing it might have been spiked?\n\nPace yourself \u2013 you\u2019re more vulnerable when you\u2019re drunk.\n\nSome bars are accredited to a Best Bar None scheme, which means they have the interests of the punters at heart.

McDonald, MD, JD, Chief Safety and Risk Officer for Health Affairs at the University of Illinois. \n\nDr. McDonald describes a case in which a patient with cancer received a second, inadvertent dose of chemotherapy, which severely damaged her mucous membranes. The doctor sought advice in communicating the mistake to the patient. In the end, the patient thanked the physician for the frank and empathetic way in which he told her about the error. And four years later, the patient is a cancer survivor.\n\nCommunication, disclosure, and apology are part of the \"seven pillars\" of patient safety:\n\nThe seven pillars of patient safety are:\n1. Occurrence reporting\n2. Assessment and investigation\n3. Communication\n4. Disclosure and apology\n5. Process or performance improvement\n6. Data analysis\n7. Education\n\nDr. McDonald was a featured speaker at The Doctors Company's 2013 Executive Advisory Board meeting, a forum where dynamic though leaders explore topics of importance to modern medical practices in the evolving healthcare environment.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR OTHER VIDEO TIPS AND NEWS\nhttp://www.youtube.com/doctorscompany\n\nVISIT OUR WEBSITE\nhttp://www.thedoctors.com\n\nLET'S CONNECT\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/doctorscompany\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-doctors-company\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thedoctorscompany", "title": "Case Study: Mitigating Malpractice Claims", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T11:36:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2yKv45X_OIo", "description": "Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 is the ultimate Star Wars battle experience, brought to life by the creators of Battlefield.

They are medium-sized raptors and the largest and broadest-winged harriers. Most of them are associated with marshland and dense reedbeds. They are found almost worldwide, excluding only the Americas.\n\nUntil recently two species were generally recognized: the Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the African Marsh Harrier (C. ranivorus). The Marsh Harrier is now usually split into several species, sometimes as many as six. These are the Western Marsh Harrier (C. aeruginosus), Eastern Marsh Harrier (C. spilonotus), Papuan Harrier (C. spilonotus spilothorax or C. spilothorax), Swamp Harrier (C. approximans), R\u00e9union Harrier (C. maillardi maillardi or C. maillardi) and Madagascar Marsh Harrier (C. maillardi macrosceles or C. macrosceles).\n\nThe Western Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus), often simply called the Marsh Harrier, breeds widely across Europe and Asia. It is migratory except in the mildest regions, and winters mainly in Africa. It hunts small mammals, insects and birds, surprising them as it drifts low over fields and reedbeds. The Western Marsh Harrier is a typical harrier, with long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight. It also resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages, but its plumages are quite different from those of its relatives. The male has wings with grey and brown sections and black wingtips. Its head, tail and underparts are greyish, except for the chestnut belly. The female is mainly brown with a cream crown and cream leading edge to her wings.\n\nThe Eastern Marsh Harrier (C. spilonotus) breeds in the grasslands and wetlands of southern Siberia, northern Mongolia, north-east China, Manchuria and Japan, and migrates for the northern winter to South-east Asia, the Philippines and northern Borneo.\n\nseehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Harrier\n\n\npicture credits :\nPic 1\nDescription  \nDansk: R\u00f8rh\u00f8g (Circus aeruginosus), Als\u00f8nderup\nDeutsch: Rohrweihe (Circus aeruginosus), Als\u00f8nderup)\nEnglish: Western marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus), Als\u00f8nderup\nDate  5 August 2010\nSource  Own work\nAuthor  Boldings\nseehttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Western_Marsh_Harrier.jpg\n\npic 2\nDescription  \nEnglish: An adult at [Hesarghatta Lake]\nDate  27 January 2013, 12:41:59\nSource  Own work\nAuthor  Sumeet Moghe\nseehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marsh_Harrier_Male.jpg", "title": "Marsh Harrier ~ Western Marsh Harrier   Bird Call  BIRDSONG", "publishedDate": "2014-05-25T15:07:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2yXM4W6V0Zs", "description": "http://EverythingCowboy.ca & http://3DBullriding.com in the Short Round of the Wanham Bullriding Extravaganza in Wanham, AB.

As a result of damage to capillaries, blood and other fluids accumulate in the lung tissue. The excess fluid interferes with gas exchange, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen levels (hypoxia).

Shea\nScreenwriter: Michael Mann\nFilm Description: A successful career criminal considers getting out of the business after one last score, while an obsessive cop desperately tries to put him behind bars in this intelligent thriller written and directed by Michael Mann. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a thief who specializes in big, risky jobs, such as banks and armored cars. He's very good at what he does; he's bright, methodical, and has honed his skills as a thief at the expense of his personal life, vowing never to get involved in a relationship from which he couldn't walk away in 30 seconds. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is an L.A.P.D. detective determined to catch McCauley, but while McCauley's personal code has forced him to do without a wife and children, Hanna's dedication has made a wreck of the home he's tried to have; he's been divorced twice, he's all but a stranger to his third wife, and he has no idea how to reach out to his troubled step-daughter. While McCauley has enough money to retire and is planning to move to New Zealand, he loves the thrill of robbery as much as the profit, and is blocking out plans for one more job; meanwhile, he's met a woman, Eady (Amy Brenneman), whom he's not so sure he can walk away from. The supporting cast includes Val Kilmer as Chris, one of McCauley's partners; Ashley Judd as his wife Charlene; Jon Voight as Nate; Hank Azaria as Alan Marciano; and Henry Rollins as Hugh, who is beaten up by Hanna.\n\nheat,\"heat clip\",\"heather headley in my mind\",heatwave,\"robert de niro\",\"kevin gage\",\"flashlight videos\",\"gun videos\",\"pistol videos\",\"robe videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime thrillers\",\"heist films\",\"psychological thrillers\",thriller,\"arnon milchan\",\"pieter jan brugge\",\"gusmano cesaretti\",\"michael mann\",\"kathleen m shea\",\"aggression videos\",\"betrayal videos\",\"disloyalty videos\",\"justice videos\",\"revenge videos\",\"hotel videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++135459,/m/06cgy,/m/07f469", "title": "Heat (5/5) Movie CLIP - Look at Me (1995) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-07T05:25:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z58Hi7Yfh0", "description": "http://www.synergystocktaking.ie - Synergy Stocktaking is an Irish bar stocktaking business with a specific system for the hospitality sector including bars, hotels and nightclubs.", "title": "Stocktaking - Uncovering the Opportunities To Increase Profits", "publishedDate": "2011-02-03T10:34:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z5eizH0u1I", "description": "DESCRIPTIONS\n\nMP3: http://www.mediafire.com/?l8mib941sqq784s (Broken)\nMP3: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9605425/Beyond%20Her%20Garden.mp3?dl\n\nBeyond Her Smooth Criminal: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9605425/Beyond%20Her%20Smooth%20Criminal.mp3\n\nVocals: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9605425/BHG%20Vocals%20131Bpm.mp3?dl\nMidi: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9605425/Beyond%20Her%20Garden%20Midi.mid?dl\n\nSong art by Jupettau: http://www.youtube.com/user/Jupettau\n\nYou try your best but it's not quite there\nYou kick a hoof and say it's just not fair\nA simple mare living simple dreams\nA rumour that's not quite as it seems\n\nCarrot top, go beyond us\nYou're a late star, time to fool us\nKeep your friends close, they're what drive you\nTo the cosmos that describes you\n\nBrighter than tonights sunset\nCan't mistake your silhouette\nNot a sound nor voice nearby\nYour mane illuminates this gloomy sky\n\nAlso plugging my tumblr because stuff get's posted there before here:\nhttp://wooden-toaster.tumblr.com/ You can also ask me any stupid shit that I will answer.\nAny donation will be massively appreciated!\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=55J56RZ3UNPM4", "title": "WoodenToaster - Beyond Her Garden", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T22:53:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z63vUN9bTk", "description": "", "title": "Forever young.

Set in Baltimore in 1954 at the birth of rock & roll, the film features Johnny Depp as Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker. Depp is pure charisma as a juvenile delinquent with a permanent tear slithering down his cheek, a reminder of his state-executed parents. In the depths of his despair appears goody-goody girl Allison (Amy Locane), who has a sexual crush on Cry-Baby. But Allison's Pat Boone-like boyfriend, Baldwin (Stephen E. Miller), the leader of the squares, is dead set against Cry-Baby and the rest of the juvenile delinquents and leads a revolt against them. In the resultant riot, the juvenile delinquents are blamed for the chaos, and Cry-Baby finds himself dispatched to reform school.\n\ncry-baby,\"cry-baby clip\",\"cry-baby trailer\",\"cry-baby part 1\",\"johnny depp\",\"iggy pop\",\"amy locane\",\"susan tyrrell\",\"traci lords\",\"ricki lake\",\"kim mcguire\",\"darren e burrows\",\"john waters\",comedy,\"contemporary movie musicals\",\"cult comedies\",\"late night comedies\",musicals,\"spoofs and satire\",\"brian grazer\",\"jim abrahams\",\"rachel talalay\",\"pat moran\",\"lust videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++11681,/m/0838fc,/m/0jfx1,/m/01whg97,/m/01l793,/m/08m038,/m/018fyy,/m/02hmn8", "title": "Cry-Baby (6/10) Movie CLIP - How to French Kiss (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-28T10:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z8mZHIhgs4", "description": "Unser Airedale Terrier E-Wurf vom 05.05.2013 bei seinem ersten Ausgang.\nDie Welpen zeigen sich sehr unbeeindruckt von der neuen Umgebung und sind furchtlos.", "title": "Airedale Terrier Welpen Vom Herzteich E Wurf mit 4  Wochen erste Ausgang", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06T10:55:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z952upgmwY", "description": "Baby De Brazza's Guenon(1 month old) and mom.\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30b6\u30b0\u30a8\u30ce\u30f3\u306e\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff08\u751f\u5f8c\u4e00\u30f6\u6708\uff09\u3002\n\nTobu Zoo.\u6771\u6b66\u52d5\u7269\u516c\u5712\u3002\n\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u3057\u3058\u307e(\u3044\u305f\u3056\u308f\u3057\u3058\u307e\u516c\u5f0fblog)\nhttp://kuzukago.exblog.jp/\n\u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\nhttp://freett.com/animalbabys/", "title": "Baby De Brazza's Guenon(1 month old) and mom.\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30b6\u30b0\u30a8\u30ce\u30f3\u306e\u8d64\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff08\u751f\u5f8c\u4e00\u30f6\u6708\uff09\u3002", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13T12:21:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z99vTuerhE", "description": "Kendrick Lamar - Collect Calls (Sechah Remix)\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sechah\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD @ https://soundcloud.com/sechah/kendrick-lamar-collect-calls\n\nWill remove on request, please contact: ibasslime@gmail.com", "title": "Kendrick Lamar - Collect Calls (Sechah Remix)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-23T19:10:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z9LzznHqCA", "description": "From the debut album 'The Perversionist'\nhttp://www.myspace.com/buriedbytheearth", "title": "Buried By The Earth - Parasitism, As The Only Practice Of The Churches", "publishedDate": "2010-12-19T05:42:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z9PzbnZVNI", "description": "\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432 \n\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0432 \u0410.\u042e \n\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438\n\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0415.\u041e", "title": "\u0410\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043e: D.LEMMA and Ksenia Kireeva - \u0411\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T14:04:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2z9XDnjmwJc", "description": "Ella Eyre on Instagram - http://instagram.com/ellaeyre\n\nMusic video by Ella Eyre performing Going On.

Build and recreate epic battle scenes between the UNSC and the Covenant with this authentic buildable vehicle! A mainstay of the UNSC military, the Pelican Dropship's primary role is to deliver troops, equipment and weaponry to and from forward combat positions, making them an essential tool in the war against the Covenant. The key to its longevity and versatility comes from its four rotating thrusters for VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) capability, allowing it to deploy or evacuate UNSC forces within moments of landing. Set your pilot in the fully functional cockpit, load your Pelican's troop bay with UNSC soldiers through the opening rear bay door and take your special forces into action!\n\nIdeal for children ages 8 and up!\n\nFeatures:\nBuildable VTOL military dropship\nFour rotating thrusters for VTOL action\nReal working rear bay door\nReal working front cockpit with space for 2 mini-figs\n1 UNSC Yellow Spartan-II with rocket launcher, 1 UNSC Yellow Spartan-II with shotgun, 1 UNSC Yellow Hayabusa Spartan-II with katana and assault rifle, 1 UNSC pilot with M6D pistol\nTroop bay holds up to 4 mini-figs\n\nThe Pelican Dropship has been a trans-atmospheric mainstay of the UNSC for many decades, with only minor design changes and improvements over the years. Its purpose is the deployment and extraction of UNSC Marine forces, with the ability to ferry in mechanized infantry such as Warthogs and Scorpion tanks. (This is somewhat the opposite use of the UNSC's other dropship design, the Albatross, called upon mainly for the delivery of vehicles, but with limited troop capacity.)\nAll thumbs lead to full-sized images\n\nAlthough primarily a trusted workhorse for the Marines, several acquisitions from pirate raids by rebels have made a captured Pelican a favorite of independents in outlying colonies. \n\nPelicans are often stored in overhead compartments onboard large UNSC vessels. They can either deploy their landing gear, or remain suspended magnetically within their docking frames.\n\nPelicans in upper storage berths on board the UNSC Pillar of Autumn\n\nThe forward edge of the docking platform is designed to align with the aft payload and troop bay of the Pelican for boarding and disembarking of troops and equipment.\n\nThe Pelican's cockpit can accommodate a seated pilot and co-pilot, as well as some standing room for other crew as needed, such as a mission commander. The pilot and co-pilot controls are exactly duplicated. In the event one pilot is incapacitated, the other can fly the Pelican solo from their own console. Under normal operations, a pilot is responsible for vehicle flight, and the co-pilot oversees vehicle/cargo deployment and retrieval, as well as handling firing control.\n\nThe compartment between the forward cabin and the troop bay contains a food rations facility, head, and some weapons storage. It also acts as an airlock between the troop area and the cockpit. Overhead, there's the Pelican's upper access hatch to the exterior.\n\nThe troop bay has seating for ten Marines, can optimally hold twelve soldiers, but can carry even more if the need arises. There is storage under each of the seats, under removable panels in the decking, and weapons and tools can also be strapped to netting overhead. There are usually two wall-mounted medical kits on either side of the troop bay airlock to the cabin.\n\nThe underside of the tail of the Pelican is useful for carrying vehicular support for the troops on board. The dropship features electro-magnetic clamps allowing the Pelican to carry the UNSC Warthog LRV, the Scorpion Main Battle Tank, or other optional cargo. A troop carrier for increasing the number of soldiers the Pelican can carry is not a common addition, but can be added as a payload to the dropship's tail. The troop bay has an airlock seal with the standard troop compartment and windows afford a view for tactical reconnaissance. This addition can increase the number of troops the bay can accommodate nearly six-fold. UNSC weapons canisters can also be individually magnetically locked and deployed from the clamps when an area is not suitable or capable for the dropship to land in.\n\nThe Pelican is equipped with EMP-resistant electronics both for tactical reasons as well as the ability to utilize magnetism to mount vehicle cargo.", "title": "Halo UNSC Pelican Dropship #96824", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T23:17:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2zBSIVxsgyY", "description": "La magnitud del terremoto se aprecia sin problema...", "title": "Video posterior al terremoto de Cinchona", "publishedDate": "2014-09-23T23:36:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "2zC27m0Kgpk", "description": "We were videotaping this...thing (I think it might be a sea cucumber?)

Sigmundov\u00e1 shows her installation External Memory, an ever growing series of photographs, 9,933 of which are on display at the Stadtgalerie Mannheim. The artist obsessively documents everything she deems to be important for her work and thus creates an objectivized form of memory. Vl\u010dek shows paintings and objects from his series of battles, war symbols, bunkers and partisans. The artist is interested in the transformation of historiography and criticizes the way history is looked at as linear and disregarded in its complexity. The show runs until July 13, 2014.\n\n\u0160tep\u00e1nka Sigmundov\u00e1 (1990) is an obsessive collector of objects and stories which form her remembering, external memory and subjective experience. In a series of works the artist accentuates different interpretations and views of personal narratives. In parallel she maps and emphasizes processes in her own environment in relation to the public sphere. Her latest exhibitions include: Jelen\u00ed Gallery, Prague (2014); Museum of Contemporary Art Wroc\u0142aw (2013); \u0160aloun On A Walk, Antik Shop Krymsk\u00e1, Prague (2013); Into The Minds Of Choices, 35m2, Prague (2012); Praha/Rennes, Anne Frank Memorial, Brno (2012); Behind The Spines Of The Books I have Not Read, Hv\u011bzda Summer Pavilion, Prague (2011). \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nka Sigmundov\u00e1 lives and works in Prague.\n\nJan Vl\u010dek (1977) was born in Plze\u0148 and graduated at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague (2005). His latest exhibitions include: Red Gallery, London (2014); Trafa\u010dka Gallery, Prague (2013); Weltecho Gallery, Chemnitz (2013); Tate Modern, (as member of Ztohoven Group) at the Starr Auditorium, London (2013); Via Art Gallery, Prague (2012); National Gallery, Prague (2012); Embassy of the Czech Republic, Berlin (2012); Lalit Kala Academy Art Gallery, New Delhi, Indie (2011); Kunsthale Wien, Vienna (2007) and Jelen\u00ed Gallery, Prague (2005).

Never rain!\"\n\"The stranger in the Istanbul Metro station (along with everyone else who told us this) was wrong. The first day we arrived in \"beautiful, sunny\" Fethiye, they had the biggest storm they had seen in years. We had plans for a boat trip, or hiking to Butterfly Valley, but with the rain, those were out of the question. So instead we went to Oludeniz, a blue lagoon that we were also told it needed to be sunny in order to enjoy. As soo as we got there, the storm picked up even worse, and we ran into the nearest bar for shelter. It lasted about a beer and a half and must have dropped 10 million gallons of water onto the beach. Fortunately, after the storm the sky opened and it turned into a beautiful day. We strolled along the rocky beach, along with a thousand other tourists--all british. One curious thing about the British--they really never see sun, because they sure don't know how to dress for it. We tried not to take too many pictures of saggy tank tops and fanny packs. But it turned out to be the best beach on our trip so far, with warm, salty waters and beautiful views.\n That night, we had the best meal of the trip so far. Fethiye has a local fish market, where you go pick out your fish (shrimp and sea bass in our case), and then take it to one of the many nearby restaurants, where they cook it for you! We were lucky enough to have a local gal help us pick out our fish, and then we ate at her family's restaurant. They cooked the fish, gave us garlic bread, a huge salad, and fish sauce for 4.5 Lira! We also got to have some Raki with the family, and talked with their son about his upcoming trip to the US. It was a very rewarding evening.\n The next day, the weather cleared up, so we went on a 12 Island boat tour. Our wooden boat had a sun deck, water slide, and diving platform. Of course, Tom's first order of buisiness was to dive off the platform, which turned into a graceful backflop instead! Our favorite stop was Aquarium bay, where we snorkeled. The water was so clear you could see 20 feet down, and there were fish all around. The last stop was red beach, which must not have been named for the color of the island (it was green) but for the color of your skin once you get there! We had a great time, even though we were sunburned by the time we got home. \n That night we had a relaxing dinner at Pasha Kepab, supposedly the best Kebabs around. They were pretty damn good. \n Tomorrow, we leaved for Rhodes and then Santorini! Turkey (and the Turkish Lira) has been good to us.\"\nRead and see more at: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/tommcatt/1/1253169120/tpod.html\n\nPhotos from this trip:\nThe storm at Oludeniz \nAfter the storm \nHurrying to get everything covered! \nThe real Oludeniz \nTom at the beach \nThe best Margarita ever \nPeaceful Oludeniz \nSightseeing at Oludeniz--the British Tourists \nBYOF - Bring your own Fish! \nThe fish market \nOur Fishy restaurant \nThe view from our hotel terrace \nCaity enjoying the view \nA Turkish Breakfast \n12 Islands Boat Trip \nIsland #1: Flat Island \nWaterslide Mustache! \nTom's Dive... err backflop \nBoat at Island #2, or 3, I've lost count \nThe clear waters of Aquarium Bay \nTom swims with the fishes \nThanks Turkey! \nBack to Fethiye \nSunset in Fethiye", "title": "\"No rain in Fethiye, Only Sun!
