It was very empowering for universal women. The story of punk could almost be a women's liberation story. Caroline Coon.\n\n1977 sees the explosion of a new subculture: Punk. Punk women were clearly visible by their appearance, clothes, makeup, hair, piercing and tattoos. Punk was the first youth movement where women were equals. Prior to punk, women were seen as the girlfriends of skins, mods, hippies and teddy boys, but a female punk was a punk.\n\nPunks, both male and female, hit the media headlines from 1976 onwards. Moral outcry erupted as the media and officialdom proclaimed Punk Public Enemy Number One. Being a punk was dangerous, so why did so many women become punks? Was it just about dressing up outrageously? Were these punk women treated as equal members of the subculture and how were they treated by the rest of society? How did being a punk affect their lives? Did punk woman directly influence society's attitudes to women today.\n\nThe lives of these women will reveal an insight into female punks and a culture that has been greatly misunderstood and misrepresented in the media.\n\nTheir personal oral histories explore their experiences of being a punk. Life stories, gigs, fashion, music, politics, friends, relations & events. The women to a varying extent agree that today they are still punks at heart, if not in appearance.\n\nWhy did women want to be punks? How did they become punks? Socially what was happening in their lives? Was it a gradual move or a sudden overnight decision? Did being a punk change their lives?\n\nThe present media interest in punk is a male-dominated vision of the era. This programme reassesses - from the perspectives of punk women - women's roles in a dynamic movement that irreversibly changed the face of society, politics, art and music.\n\n\nDirector: Zillah Minx -- Lead singer with punk band rubella ballet since 1976.\nhttp://rubellaballet.bandcamp.com/merch/shes-a-punk-rocker-u-k-dvd", "title": "Zillah Minx in She's A Punk Rocker U.K", "publishedDate": "2007-06-20T22:00:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYO9lNBSyAE", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Forbidden Dragons IP Biloxi", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T20:13:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYO_A2zL6HI", "description": "Francis Okoro is a 6'8 8th grader who blocks absolutely everything.

Pictures. Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point. The film adaptation had languished in one form of development hell or another for years after the book's release, with various directors on and off the project, including Terry Gilliam, David Hayter, and Darren Aronofsky, as well as Paul Greengrass, whose eventual dismissal stemmed from budget conflicts with the studio.\n\nwatchmen,\"watchmen clip\",\"watchmen soundtrack\",\"watchmen intro\",\"jackie earle haley\",\"zack snyder\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"comic books and superheroes\",\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"lawrence gordon\",\"lloyd levin\",\"thomas tull\",\"lorne orleans\",\"herb gains\",\"deborah snyder\",\"wesley coller\",\"justice videos\",\"values videos\",\"apartment videos\",\"city videos\",\"new york videos\",\"street videos\",rorschach,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++353567,/m/01lxl6", "title": "Watchmen (1/9) Movie CLIP - Rorschach's Journal (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T09:54:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYWY5NaFhpA", "description": "Esta ma\u00f1ana, en el ingreso del Parque Nacional Podocarpus por la ciudad de Zamora, se realiz\u00f3 la entrega efectiva al Ministerio del Ambiente de tres predios comprados por Naturaleza y Cultura Internacional, para que sean incorporados a la gesti\u00f3n integral de las \u00e1reas protegidas.", "title": "TERRENOS PODOCARPUS", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T01:00:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYW_WflRXFM", "description": "Attack of the Jumping Cholla Cactus Part 1 Dyslexic Nomad", "title": "Attack of the Jumping Cholla Cactus Part 1 Dyslexic Nomad", "publishedDate": "2012-01-01T05:51:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYWkY7r0Glc", "description": "LINE Rangers review Thunder Cony 4 Star Ranger\n\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21 : -\nFanpage : https://www.facebook.com/deksearchchannel\nGoogle Plus+ : https://www.google.com/+Deksearchchannel\nLINE ID : bankes\nBeeTalk ID : 19603485", "title": "LINE Rangers review Thunder Cony 4 Star Ranger", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T20:19:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "BYX7kPV_a50", "description": "Please use EARPHONES or HEADPHONES for listening.\nView the entire Heart Sounds Collection: http://goo.gl/3yzlg\nMore useful medical videos: http://goo.gl/H5hDF Visit our website: http://doctorprodigious.wordpress.com .\n\nVisit our website: http://doctorprodigious.wordpress.com/", "title": "27.

The incident happened at the Government Secondary School for Science, a technical school located in the northeastern Nigerian town of Potiskum, which had seen a prior suicide bombing attack just a week earlier.\n\nThis particular attack was carried out to increase the amount of casualties due to its timing; some 2000 students were gathered in front of the school to hear a weekly address from faculty around 7:30am local time. The bomber wore the uniform of the school, helping him to blend into the surroundings better. \n\nWhile no group has claimed responsibility yet, it is assumed to be the work of Boko Haram, the same group who has carried out similar jihadist attacks on schools before, all aimed at preventing children from receiving a western-style education. The group is well known for carrying out a mass abduction of over 200 schoolgirls from a school in a remote village in April.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

Foreign Exchange (FX) Market analysis is a daily market overview and commentary\n\n\nDebt crisis continues\n\nIt was a turbulent day for markets yesterday, as they ponder over the escalating European debt crisis and the evident failure to reach agreement on raising the US debt ceiling. As it stands Europe's crisis looks to be going from bad to worse, as suggested in the record breaking higher costs of French, Italian and Greek debt yesterday. The situation reached breaking point as Italy suspended trading on government and corporate bonds following last weeks release of EU stress tests. The panic led to billions wiped off the value of European banks with the UK alone losing \u00a36.3bln with Lloyds falling 7.5%, with RBS and Barclays losing 6% and 3.7% respectively.\n\nDespite Italy grabbing the headlines attention is still very much focussed on Greece and reaching agreement on a second bailout for the country, with further discussions at the special EU summit on Thursday. The hot issue remains the extent of private sector participation in any debt restructuring. The assessment to improve the flexibility of the EFSF bailout fund to embark on debt buybacks has not helped. As a result contagion risks to other countries in the Eurozone periphery are at a heightened state. In spite of this the EUR has shown a degree of resilience, having failed to sustain its recent drop below 1.40 versus USD and currently trades at 1.4156. A possible reason for the EUR's bounce is that the situation on the other side of the pond does not look much better. Murmurs of QE3 in the US and the stalemate between Republicans and Democrats on budget deficit cutting measures tied to any increase in the debt ceiling are limiting the Greenback's ability to profit from Europe's distress. Furthermore, more weak data including a drop in the Empire manufacturing survey and a drop in the Michigan consumer sentiment index to a two-year low, have added to the worries about US recovery prospects. \n\nAgainst this background risk aversion will remain elevated, supporting the likes of the CHF and JPY while the EUR and USD will continue to fight it out for the winner of the ugliest currency contest. Assuming that a deal will eventually be cobbled together to raise the US debt ceiling (albeit with less ambitious deficit cutting measures than initially hoped for) and that the Fed does not embark on QE3, the EUR will emerge as the most ugly currency, but there will be plenty of volatility in the meantime. \n\nReport by Philip Ryan", "title": "19th July 2011 -  Daily market analysis by Phil Ryan", "publishedDate": "2011-07-19T09:56:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ-Th-87Ovw", "description": "http://www.przeklej.pl/plik/figo-fagot-pack-zip-002b1s9la6jo - link do pobrania\n\nPiosenka Braci Figo Fagot - Nie m\u00f3w \u017ce tego nie zna\u0142a\u015b, z odcinku \"FINA\u0141\".

The Sena and the BJP cut a 25-year alliance ahead of the election, with the Sena bearing monumental costs for the split.\nSources on both sides say that the economy-size Cabinet telegraphs that a merger is likely to be forged, but some in the Sena feel that being excluded from the first cut of the government will be too sharp a rebuff to live with. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has yet to accept the invitation to tomorrow's grand event at Wankhede Stadium.\n\nBut the Sena's hallmark bravado has been wiped clean.

In his first role since winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2001, Benicio del Toro stars as Aaron Hallam, one of the U.S. military's most skilled hand-to-hand combat operatives. In the years following his successful assassination of a Serbian warlord in late-'90s Kosovo, Hallam finds himself plagued by traumatic flashbacks of death and destruction, so much so that when he finally returns home, he regresses into a feral, survivalist state in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. There, he deliberately and elaborately hunts and kills poachers who happen to cross his path. When the FBI investigates the murders, they call in the man who taught Hallam everything he knows: retiree L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones). As the instructor pursues his unhinged former pupil, Bonham begins to learn about key events in Hallam's life that pushed him over the edge.\n\n\"the hunted\",\"the hunted clip\",\"the hunted trailer\",\"the hunted part 1\",\"the hunted knife fight\",\"the hunted full movie\",\"the hunted 1995\",\"the hunted 2003\",\"benicio del toro\",\"william friedkin\",\"gun videos\",\"knife videos\",\"scope videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"crime thrillers\",\"spy thrillers\",\"marcus viscidi\",\"judgment videos\",\"life and death videos\",\"madness videos\",\"violence videos\",\"forest videos\",\"woods videos\",\"aaron hallam\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++267164,/m/01qscs", "title": "The Hunted (3/8) Movie CLIP - Hunters Become Hunted (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-03-03T00:18:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ1VZ91Xzfg", "description": "\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e19\u0e31\u0e17 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e01\u0e47\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e17\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e01\u0e35\u0e15\u0e49\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22  \u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e15\u0e34\u0e14\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48 \u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27\u0e04\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e01\u0e47\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\n\n\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e41\u0e04\u0e48\u0e04\u0e23\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e42\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49 \u0e2e\u0e48\u0e32\u0e46", "title": "\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e14\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e43\u0e08 finger-style by aphorist", "publishedDate": "2013-08-13T18:23:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ1hUV661g4", "description": "", "title": "gemaci\u00f3n: reproducci\u00f3n asexual", "publishedDate": "2014-01-18T17:24:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ23BnFd2qo", "description": "Brassica Musicals Heerhugowaard tijdens het Coolplein festival 2013.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus This article is about the divergence of Homo sapiens from other species. For a complete timeline of human evolution, see Timeline of human evolution. For other uses, see Human evolution (disambiguation).\"Evolution of Man\" redirects here. For the album by Example, see The Evolution of Man.Human evolution is the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans. The topic usually covers the evolutionary history of primates, in particular the genus Homo, and the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of hominids (or \"great apes\") rather than studying the evolutionary history that led to primates. The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines, including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and genetics.Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around 55 million years ago.The family Hominidae diverged from the Hylobatidae (Gibbon) family 15-20 million years ago, and around 14 million years ago, the Ponginae (orangutans) diverged from the Hominidae family. Bipedalism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line, and the earliest bipedal Hominin is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin, with Ardipithecus, a full bipedal, coming somewhat later. Either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be the last shared ancestor between chimps and humans. The early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines, and later into the genus Homo.  The earliest documented members of the genus Homo are Homo habilis, which evolved around 2.3 million years ago; the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone tools. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human SRGAP2 gene doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex. During the next million years a process of encephalization began, and with the arrival of Homo erectus in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled to 850  cm3. Homo erectus and Homo ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between 1.3 to 1.8 million years ago. This increase in human brain size is equivalent to every generation having an additional 125,000 neurons more than their parents. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. According to the Recent African Ancestry theory, modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rhodesiensis or Homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing local populations of Homo erectus, Homo denisova, Homo floresiensis and Homo neanderthalensis.Archaic Homo sapiens, the forerunner of anatomically modern humans, evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominids, such as Denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day humans, suggestive of a limited inter-breeding between these species. Anatomically modern humans evolved from archaic Homo sapiens in the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago.The transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture, language, and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000 years ago according to many anthropologists] although some suggest a gradual change in behavior over a longer time span.", "title": "People love in relation with Black face langur Gray langurs or Hanuman langurs", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T16:37:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ2wg0aVn9c", "description": "War on Al Shabaab - Somali Govt reprieve", "title": "War on Al Shabaab - Somali Govt reprieve", "publishedDate": "2011-11-21T18:13:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ2wxbLQGiQ", "description": "Saturday Night Live Brasil no dia 08/07/2012 \n\nQuero ver chu!\nQuero ver pa!\n\nQuero ver chupa \npa chupa!\n\nOs bambi Chu!\nPorcada pa!\n\nSantista chupa\npa chupa!\n\nNa Libertadores  mano vinha me zoar\nQue era s\u00f3 no Playstation que o Curintia ia ganhar\nMe chamava gamb\u00e1, maloqueiro e sofredor\nPobre, sujo, sem est\u00e1dio, ladr\u00e3o e sequestrador\nPensei em fazer um livro pra poder te explicar\nMas eu fiz essa dancinha, pro Neymar comemorar\n\n---------------------- REFR\u00c3O -------------------------\n\nA mensagem da Fiel vai para o Brasil inteiro\nChupa Galo, Fogo e Flu, Paysandu e o Cruzeiro\nChupa Mengo, Vasco, Ponte, Gr\u00eamio e Internacional\nE um chupa exclusivo ao Guarani da capital\nO Goi\u00e1s j\u00e1 chupou, o Vit\u00f3ria vai chupar\nS\u00e3o Paulino tenho medo dos bambi apaixonar\n\n---------------------- REFR\u00c3O -------------------------\n\nQuem te boca, chupa!\nTorceu pro boca, chupa!\n\nBy: MA4H", "title": "SNL Brasil : Resposta do Corinthians - 08/07/2012", "publishedDate": "2012-07-09T01:13:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ2xttWDRhg", "description": "dongle ibox funcionando perfectamente con azfox \n1\u00b0 antena para el dongle apuntada al hispasat \n2\u00b0 antena para el deco azfox s2s apuntada al amazonas conectado al deco\nprecios por mayor\ncontacto:\nmarko_1982conce@hotmail.com cons", "title": "decodificador y dongle ibox", "publishedDate": "2012-08-13T19:06:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ3Bl5qCF18", "description": "Um novo laxante!

Se debe absorber la humedad con un pa\u00f1o limpio o con una gasa, sin presionar ni frotar. \n\nAl mismo tiempo, la piel presentar\u00e1 resecamiento con la consiguiente descamaci\u00f3n, por lo que se har\u00e1 necesario hidratar y nutrir. Hay que impedir que las lesiones inflamatorias y ulceraciones sigan prosperando y se extiendan.\n\nLa hidrataci\u00f3n y nutrici\u00f3n de la piel de los labios y sus alrededores puede llevarse a cabo con una crema o emulsi\u00f3n de f\u00f3rmula natural. La epidermis debe recuperar su p\u00e9rdida de col\u00e1geno y elastina. \n\nDe todos modos, las cremas o emulsiones se deben aplicar con moderaci\u00f3n. Abundar en ellas podr\u00eda crear un clima propicio para el desarrollo de bacterias.\n\nEn el caso de la queilitis angular es fundamental evitar la costumbre de lamerse o morderse los labios. El hecho de estar a cada rato mojando la zona afectada no contribuye a la cura.\n\nEn el momento en que se mojan los labios llega un alivio moment\u00e1neo, aunque una vez que la saliva se seca no hace otra cosa que resecar la piel. Tambi\u00e9n la saliva puede contener microbios provenientes de la boca, que no har\u00e1n m\u00e1s que expandirse hacia la parte externa y penetrar en las grietas lesionadas. \n\nPara disminuir el ardor a la vez que hidratar los labios, se puede recurrir a la manteca de cacao o a alg\u00fan tipo de labial que hidrate, que no contenga perfumes ni otros aditivos.\n\nPero de nada valdr\u00eda hidratar y nutrir por fuera si adem\u00e1s no se hidrata y nutre el organismo por dentro. Hay que beber suficiente cantidad de agua, no menos de dos litros por d\u00eda, a la vez que consumir unas cinco porciones de frutas y verduras. \n\nLos alimentos que se ingieran deben tener vitaminas A y del grupo B, en especial B2 (riboflavina), B3 (niacina) y B6 (piridoxina). \n\nTampoco deben faltar el hierro y el zinc, dos minerales esenciales para fortalecer el sistema inmunol\u00f3gico y evitar la anemia. Se sabe, un sistema inmunol\u00f3gico reforzado ser\u00e1 la mejor barrera para curar e impedir un rebrote de la queilitis angular.\n\nSi se aborda el tratamiento adecuado de la queilitis angular con los primeros signos, dif\u00edcilmente la afecci\u00f3n se agrave. Cuando ya la queilitis angular muestra llagas, sangrado, infecciones, lo conveniente es recurrir a la ayuda de un m\u00e9dico dermat\u00f3logo, para que prescriba las medicaciones adecuadas. \n\n\nNo obstante, debe llevarse a cabo y convertirse en un h\u00e1bito la hidrataci\u00f3n con suficiente cantidad de agua y la nutrici\u00f3n balanceada.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 podemos hacer YA mismo?\n\nHoy existe un novedoso tratamiento, totalmente natural y muy simple, con el que se puede eliminar la queilitis angular o boqueras en tan solo 7 d\u00edas (o menos). Este revolucionario sistema ataca la verdadera causa de la enfermedad y no solo los s\u00edntomas, asegurando resultados a largo plazo. \n\nSi usted desea eliminar para siempre esas grietas dolorosas y la verg\u00fcenza que causa esta afecci\u00f3n, puede conocer este m\u00e9todo de resultados comprobados haciendo clic en el siguiente enlace:\nhttp://queilitis-angular.good-info.co\n\n\nPara M\u00e1s Informaci\u00f3n \n\nhttp://queilitis-angular.good-info.co\n\n\n\nVisita Nuestro Blog\n\nhttp://labios-partidos.blogspot.com/\n\n\nSubscribete A Nuestro Canal\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ6WJ0NEXOE\n\nBoqueras Remedios, Queilitis Angular Tratamiento, Estomatitis Herpetica Primaria, Queilitis Atopica, remedio para las llagas en la boca,  yagas en la boca,  remedios para boqueras labios,  ulceraciones bucales,  comisuras labios,  tratamiento para las boqueras,  remedio para las boqueras,  curar boqueras rapido,  remedios naturales para llagas en la boca,  tratamiento para candidiasis,  boqueras perleche,  tratamiento queilitis,  remedios caseros para labios agrietados,", "title": "Boqueras Remedios, Queilitis Angular Tratamiento, Estomatitis Herpetica Primaria, Queilitis Atopica", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T19:42:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ6dX0fhwfg", "description": "http://olneytheatre.org     ||  Actors Alex Podulke and Patricia Hurley discuss performing the works of George Bernard Shaw as well as the the plot of the Olney Theatre Center's production of Misalliance directed by John Going, running through October 24, 2010.\n\nGet your tickets for our current season today online at http://olneytheatre.org  or by calling our box office at 301-294-3400.  \n\nFor news about upcoming shows, social events and exclusive deals, also follow us on Twitter @OlneyTheatre or Like us on Facebook!\n\nVideo by Joe Grimme, Angle Drive Films", "title": "Alex & Patricia on \"Misalliance\" & Shaw", "publishedDate": "2011-05-18T14:55:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ6vXowQp4w", "description": "Munich Swing Orchestra\nrecorded live at Bavaria Music Studios", "title": "Munich Swing Orchestra - Pennsylvania 6-5000", "publishedDate": "2011-01-29T06:50:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ7GSF2BgBU", "description": "This video will teach you how to deal with hyperventilation in the dental office.", "title": "Gonna Make You Hyperventilate", "publishedDate": "2010-05-18T18:10:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZ7pNFB3XKY", "description": "Music video by Cosmic Slop Shop performing Sinful.

Abel, you're fired. Out,' he says, according to a recording of the call obtained by media reporter Jim Romanesko.\nArmstrong is then silent for about 10 seconds before he resumes talking about the cutbacks without explaining the firing.\nThe employee that Armstrong fired is Abel Lenz, Patch's creative director, according to Romanesko, who broke news of the call.\nWhen Romenesko tweeted at Lenz on Saturday for a comment on the firing, Lenz replied: 'I appreciate the interest Jim, but I have nothing to share. Go Patch!'\nSeveral hours later, Lenz tweeted to no one in particular, 'No comment,' and attached a photo from inside Old Town Bar in Manhattan.\nAccording to Patch employees, Lenz often snapped pictures during conference calls and staff meetings and would later post them to the company's internal website. \nThe conference call, held one day after AOL announced major cutbacks at Patch, was meant to boost morale for the employees remaining with the news organization. \nLenz assured the employees on the call that AOL is still committed to Patch's success and asked anyone who does not believe him to leave their jobs. \n'If you don't use Patch as a product and you're not invested in Patch, you owe it to everybody else at Patch to leave,' he said. 'If you think what's going on right now is a joke, and you want to joke around about it, you should pick your stuff up and leave Patch today.'\nHe also complained about leaks to the press, saying they won't change the direction that Patch is going.\n'I don't care what the press says, I don't care if people leak information... I also want to clear up the fact that leaking information or anything around Patch isn't going to bother me, doesn't bother me. I'm not changing direction.\n'When you hear about what we're doing at Patch it's very serious and it's very forward-thinking and anything that happens around Patch isn't going to change that direction.'\nSeveral minutes after firing Lenz, however, Armstrong indicated that he does, indeed, care about leaks. \nHe said leaks were making Patch seem like 'loser-ville' in the press, according to Business Insider.\nHe said, 'That's why Abel was fired.'\n'We can't have people that are in the locker room giving the game plan away.'\nBelow is an excerpt of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong's call with employees: \n'There's a couple of things I want you guys to realize and really think about and sink in, and if it doesn't sink in and you don't believe what I'm about to say, I'm going to ask you to leave Patch. And I don't mean that in a harsh way; I mean that in the way of we have to get Patch into a place where it's going to be successful and it's going to be successful for a long time. There's a whole bunch of towns that are going to be successful but we need the whole enterprise to be successful.\n'The first one is, I will take full credit and full responsibility for anything that's not right at Patch. If the coffee machine doesn't work, or a town doesn't work \u2014 anything that's going wrong at Patch you can blame me for it. I founded Patch, we brought it into AOL, we've been very busy turning around AOL overall.\n'I don't care what the press says, I don't care if people leak information. I've already lived through that at AOL \u2014 when I took over AOL \u2014 so if you need somebody to blame for why we're making changes at Patch you can blame me. I take full responsibility. ...\n'I also want to clear up the fact that leaking information or anything around Patch isn't going to bother me, doesn't bother me. I'm not changing direction. When you hear about what we're doing at Patch it's very serious and it's very forward-thinking and anything that happens around Patch isn't going to change that direction.\n'Third thing is if you don't use Patch as a product and you're not invested in Patch, you owe it to everybody else at Patch to leave. If you think what's going on right now is a joke, and you want to joke around about it, you should pick your stuff up and leave Patch today, and the reason is, and I'm going to be very specific about this, is Patch from an experience \u2014 Abel, put that camera down right now. Abel, you're fired. Out! [10-second pause]. If you guys think that AOL has not been committed to Patch, and won't stay committed to Patch, you're wrong. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars, the board of directors is committed, I'm committed. ....'", "title": "Caught on Tape: AOL CEO Tim Armstrong Fires Employee in Front of 1000 Workers for Taking Picture", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T13:52:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZU9FKzV4mY", "description": "", "title": "bullet pleating machine", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T05:13:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "BZUQQmcR5-g", "description": "This is the movie of Fig 1 of the paper, Atsushi Tero, et al.

Many times I see atheists lose footing in debates by errantly conceding to some apologist that the \"Laws of Logic\" (ie, Aristotle's three laws) are immaterial \"things\" that somehow exist in their own right and must be \"accounted for\". In reality, these are nothing more than linguistic constructs..statements which describe the properties and relations between things that actually exist. The laws of logic are simply *descriptions* of the facts of reality. A conceptual law like \"A = A\" does not need to exist for an object to be \"whatever it is\", any more than a human-made map needs to exist for the geographical locations the map refers to to exist. \n\nThe laws of logic do not exist independently of human minds, and do not need to be \"accounted for\" by naturalists. They are simply what happens when we try to describe the nature of reality using human language. So don't let apologists trip you up with their faulty assumption that logical laws are anything more than descriptive (not prescriptive) statements about reality.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some articles debunking the transcendental argument for god (TAG):\n\nhttp://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.ph...\nhttp://www.infidels.org/library/moder...\n\nThis video was reuploaded with permission of mrgodbehere.

The second half saw the Americans performing better.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo estableci\u00f3 Silvestre Varela por un gol tard\u00edo para dar a Portugal un empate 2-2 con Estados Unidos.\n\nRonaldo envi\u00f3 un remate en el \u00faltimo minuto del tiempo de descuento y Varela anot\u00f3 con una volea en los \u00faltimos segundos del partido.\n\nNani hab\u00eda anotado primero para Portugal, el tiro pasado Tim Howard en el minuto cinco, pero los norteamericanos respondieron en el segundo tiempo del partido.\n\nJermaine Jones hizo el 1-1 con un disparo que se encrespa en el minuto 64 tras un centro de Graham Zusi hecho su camino a trav\u00e9s de la defensa de Portugal.\n\nClint Dempsey puso a los norteamericanos por delante a los 81 minutos. El capit\u00e1n de Estados Unidos utiliz\u00f3 su est\u00f3mago para dirigir el bal\u00f3n a la red a partir de una profundidad de Zusi.\n\nEl \u00faltimo segundo sorteo niega a los estadounidenses un lugar en la segunda ronda, pero se mantuvo Portugal con vida en el torneo.\n\nLos Estados Unidos ahora tiene cuatro puntos en el Grupo G, el mismo que Alemania. Tanto Portugal y Ghana tienen un punto. Los estadounidenses se enfrentar\u00e1n a Alemania el jueves, mientras que Portugal tiene sobre Ghana.\n\nEra todo Portugal durante gran parte del primer tiempo, con Ronaldo en el equipo titular. La segunda mitad vio a los estadounidenses realizar mejor.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo configurar Silvestre Varela por um empate no final para dar a Portugal um empate 2-2 com os Estados Unidos.\n\nRonaldo mandou um cruzamento no \u00faltimo minuto dos acr\u00e9scimos e Varela marcou com um mergulho de cabe\u00e7a nos \u00faltimos segundos da partida.\n\nNani marcou primeiro para Portugal, atirando passado Tim Howard no quinto minuto, mas os norte-americanos responderam no segundo tempo da partida.\n\nJermaine Jones fez 1-1 com um tiro de curling no minuto 64 depois de um cruzamento Graham Zusi fez o seu caminho atrav\u00e9s da defesa de Portugal.\n\nClint Dempsey colocou os americanos \u00e0 frente no 81. O capit\u00e3o Estados Unidos usou a sua barriga para direcionar a bola para a rede a partir de um cruzamento de Zusi.\n\nO \u00faltimo segundo sorteio negou os americanos um lugar no segundo turno, mas manteve Portugal vivo no torneio.\n\nOs Estados Unidos tem agora quatro pontos no Grupo G, o mesmo que na Alemanha. Tanto Portugal e Gana t\u00eam um ponto. Os americanos v\u00e3o enfrentar a Alemanha na quinta-feira, enquanto que Portugal assume Gana.\n\nEra tudo Portugal durante grande parte do primeiro tempo, com Ronaldo na equipe titular.

It is not an impartial record but it remains one of the West's most important sources regarding these affairs. Moreover, it established without precedent the genre and study of history in the Western world, although historical records and chronicles existed beforehand.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nTitle_page_of_Herodotus'_history_of_the_Greek_and_Persian_Wars_1502.jpg from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Title_page_of_Herodotus'_history_of_the_Greek_and_Persian_Wars_1502.jpg\n\nPOxy_v0017_n2099_a_01_hires.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)\n\nRelief_Herodotus_cour_Carree_Louvre.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus\n\nHerodotos_Met_91.8.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus", "title": "All About - Histories (Herodotus)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T16:56:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_JEdy503ks", "description": "pleomorphic bacteria infected blood", "title": "morphing bacteria in blood", "publishedDate": "2010-07-13T17:25:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_Jmwnz29ko", "description": "For more information, visit www.techransfer.com and www.myodesie.com\n\nThis video discusses the operation of a Mitsubishi ST Sealing Steam system.

I also play harmonica, and am arguably one of the best in the world. But thank God, there really never can be an actual best, but I'm damn good. I'm gonna teach you a few things about the harmonica.  \n\nMy best advice to play the harmonica, and I say this because it's funny, it's a lot like life: Sometimes you blow, sometimes you suck.  You... just do what sounds good to your ears. Just have fun going *plays harmonica notes*.  Break up the pattern, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in twice, breathe out twice, breathe out twice, breathe in once, then breath out again.  Bob Dylan, who is a poetic genius, is actually a pretty simplistic harmonica player, and he taught a generation is that all you have to do is *plays harmonica notes*.  Now I'm not playing a melodies right there.  Bob Dylan sort of played melodies, but you can kinda just ham it up and have fun.  And as you do that you start to hear things, and really pay attention to what your ears are hearing.  And find melodies that you like, and gradually, you start going *plays harmonica notes*.  And people around you will be driven nuts by this. They will not be able to stand what you're doing, but in your mind, you'll go \"Wow, I kind... la la la, la la la.\"  It's like humming, but with these chords.  And gradually over time you will start to feel your way around the harmonica.  You'll know exactly where things are. When you start to go *plays harmonica notes*.  And that's just making something up off the top of your head.  And you can tell as I was playing, you get a little more focused on single notes.  That again is just playing smoother, and calmer, purse your lips a little more, focus the air on one whole opposed to more chords.  But again don't let that bother you, don't let it distract you. There's a saying that a saxophone player told me, \"If it sounds good to you, it's right.\"  And that's the great thing about the harmonica, there's no pressure.  Enjoy the sounds, you're making.  And screw what other people say, at least for the beginning. Eventually if you live in rent control or on someone's couch, you'll have to listen to what they say.

After finding out the news her wish was for her beautiful voice to go viral so we all did our part of sharing her youtube cover to Bonnie Raitt \"I can't make you love me\" and we got various celebrities to see it and they shared it and helped it get to over 300,000 views which it is on now. http://youtu.be/BFJ8l4IVw7I\nShe then got told that her own song \"Two Thirds Of A Piece\" was going to be released onto iTunes, but Georgina sadly lost her battle and passed away on Thursday 14th November morning in the arms of her parents. Her funeral was Friday 22nd. There was so many people inside, people also gathered outside to listen as there was speakers outside. Georgina was such a beautiful person, inside and out. She also had a very beautiful voice which everyone should listen to. She had the voice of an angel and now she is singing with them.\nHer dream came true as when it was released not long after she passed away, her own song written and sang by her managed to get all the way to number 16 on the iTunes charts. Even Simon Cowell tweeted about it. \nWhen it was first released it managed to get to 16, we think if everyone pulls together it may manage to get to number 1. I made this video to try help promote her beautiful song. This would be a real comfort to the family as this is their first Christmas without their beautiful daughter. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/two-thirds-of-a-piece-single/id749412145\nhttps://play.google.com/store/music/album/Georgina_Anderson_Two_Thirds_of_a_Piece?id=B6i36bzsycl7cneahui34jtgk2u\nRest in peace beautiful, you will be sadly missed and are forever in our hearts.

Well recorded, clean, animals vocalizations are a must for creating any organic real sounding monster, not to mention using the proper animal vocal for a documentary presentation of a specific species. Animals require a good quiet location because they are not as loud as traffic, a car, airplane, or industrial machinery. Recording at Zoo\u2019s is mostly a miss for this reason, sometimes you can get lucky in off hours or a well placed Zoo without too much bg noise. Because we can not control the direction of the animals\u2019 projected vocal we are often presented with off-mic sounds that we have to salvage and clean through mastering, another benefit to a quiet location.\n\nThe next step in recording animals is planning when to record them. In my experience captive animals are generally most loud in the morning before feeding time. More wild animals like Lions and Tigers instinctually grunt and roar in the evening before sundown. The best way to plan your recording is by asking the caretaker about the animals\u2019 behaviour and then plan to be there well in advance so you can setup your equipment beforehand. Some animals respond differently to \u201cnew\u201d people being around and in some cases you may have to set up your gear and simply let it roll while you hang out in the distance. I have had to do this with Lions, however these Reindeer were much more accustomed to people.\n\nReindeer are a herd type animal and we use this to our benefit by using simple separation techniques, when a member of the herd is removed the animals will generally start talking. This also works with horses, especially as the distance increases between the herd and the individual separated. For these Reindeer we used ZFR-200 recorders with Sanken COS-11D microphones with ample wind protection. Three reindeer were mic\u2019d up before sundown and early in the predawn morning, both sets of recordings lasted five hours.\n\nBack in the cutting room we search for waveform spikes and dug out the vocalizations and snorts. A handheld Neumann 191i microphone sounds better than any Lav microphone however it\u2019s nearly impossible to keep any Reindeer on the mic axis for that long. Also having a person with a Zeppelin and windjammer chasing them drastically impairs their willingness to perform vocally. My approach is to record animals at their \u201cpeak\u201d performance period with a Neumann handheld microphone and record simultaneously a five hour take with the ZFR-200 and COS-11 D. Animals are all about time and patience. Good luck recording.\n\nPlease make a healthy donation to help the animals!\n\nVideo shot and edited by Kristina Stepanova.", "title": "Reindeer Sound Effects Recording", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T20:21:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_p3Dgq89DM", "description": "more stella deus, more songs", "title": "STELLA DEUS OST 28 unfavorable circumstances", "publishedDate": "2009-08-05T22:14:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_pQDpsjNHE", "description": "I Never Learn.

The name is a combination of the Mongolic word dalai meaning \"ocean\" and the Tibetan word \u0f56\u0fb3\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b (bla-ma) meaning \"guru, teacher, mentor\".\n\nThe Dalai Lama is traditionally thought to be the rebirth in a line of tulkus who are considered to be manifestations of the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokite\u015bvara. The Dalai Lama is often thought to be the leader of the Gelug School, but this position belongs officially to the Ganden Tripa, which is a temporary position appointed by the Dalai Lama who, in practice, exerts much influence. The line of Dalai Lamas began as a lineage of spiritual teachers; the 5th Dalai Lama assumed political authority over Tibet.\n\nFor certain periods between the 17th century and 1962, the Dalai Lamas sometimes directed the Tibetan government, which administered portions of Tibet from Lhasa. The 14th Dalai Lama remained the head of state for the Central Tibetan Administration (\"Tibetan government in exile\") until his retirement on March 14, 2011. He has indicated that the institution of the Dalai Lama may be abolished in the future, and also that the next Dalai Lama may be found outside Tibet and may be female. The Chinese government rejected this and asserted that only it has the authority to select the next Dalai Lama.\" - from Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\nFor more pronunciation of Japanese words, please check: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4JALsptyAzrbc1xVMxjj2QA1jgYAwrDV\n\n\nOr how Foreign Words are pronunced in Japan, please check:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4JALsptyAzrqkXyiz34ldUlYEYKQwkRW\n\n\nFor more playlist, please check below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JapaneseEng101/playlists", "title": "How to Pronounce Dalai Lama", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T06:28:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_w_JQdz32E", "description": "Scholls Valley Native Nursery\nwww.SchollsValley.com\nPO Box 231088\nTigard, OR 97223\nPhone: 503.624.1766      \nFax: 503.624.2766\n\nIntroducing Symphoricarpos mollis - Trailing Snowberry\nThere's nothing prettier than the simple pink flowers surrounded by the rounded soft green leaves of the trailing snowberry. However, the springtime flowers are only part of the picture when it comes to the trailing snowberry. The summer brings waxy white berries that adorn the reddish stems of this easy to maintain plant.\nThe Symphoricarpos mollis - Trailing Snowberry is a local inhabitant of the wooded hills and low to middle elevations of the Pacific coastal areas. Those beautiful creeping plants are great groundcover and often their flowers attract hummingbirds, while other birds eat their berries. You might not want to join them in the feast, however. The berries contain saponins, a substance that makes them taste a great deal like soap. Eaten in large quantities, saponins are toxic, but you'd have to eat a few pounds of them because they tend to go through the body without causing harm, since the body doesn't absorb it well. In most cases, it only takes tasting one berry to realize you want no more. \nDespite their awful taste, these plants are quite beneficial to their local environment. They receive their name creeping for a reason. They spread slowly via rhizomes. They often grow on the northern slopes of mountains, occasionally in the full sun or in ravines. They provide beautiful ground cover and help prevent soil erosion once established.\nThese are friendly plants thriving well when planted with others. They are particularly good to plant with corral bells, currents and ferns. You can also plant them with other woodland plants to create a natural setting where all plants benefit.\nYou'll find these shrubs may grow as tall as seven feet and spread rapidly. They like light shade or cool sun and have minimal water needs, making them almost carefree in the right environment. If you plant them in a wilder environment, they're also deer tolerant so you won't find them stubbles after a visitation from the wildlife.\nWhile these delightful plants grow well almost anywhere in their native area, they do have some restrictions when it comes to temperature. They're normally hardy until the temperature reaches 0 to -10 degrees. However, their native environment seldom reaches those temperatures, so they tend to thrive when planted there. To learn more about the delicate woodland plant called the Symphoricarpos mollis - Trailing Snowberry, visit a local native plant nursery or a website specializing in native plants to the Pacific Northwest.", "title": "Scholls Valley Native Nursery | Introducing Symphoricarpos mollis - Trailing Snowberry", "publishedDate": "2013-04-18T21:05:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_x0x2s_5pk", "description": "", "title": "HindiLogo", "publishedDate": "2012-10-31T07:44:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_xERLAxuyo", "description": "Ceramic bearings", "title": "Ceramic Bearings -  http://ceramic-bearing.blogspot.com/", "publishedDate": "2008-09-14T16:59:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "B_xJ9euDeYk", "description": "My first video is Academic English Vocabulary - Cause & Effect 0001.

The technology in these  types of multi axis press brakes allow our operators to preform complex bending operations in one simple pass.\n\nThis equipment ultimately \n- saves our operators time.. \n- increases our speed and efficiency.. \n- which translates to consistently accurate, high quality outcomes..\n- as lower overall production costs for our customers.\n\nOur press brakes are shown completing a series of bending operations on a complex component.  As the operator moves down the beam a number of different bends are completed in a single step. Less sophisticated press brakes handle only one bending task at a time, requiring tooling to be changed for each bending operation.\n\nBefore commencing the job, the operator checks the sequence of bends, bend angles to complete the finish profile or component. All this information is taken from a 3D model that was originally designed in Solidworks for the customer.\nThe bending software identifies the correct tooling required, and displays the layout and position of this tooling on the machine for the operator to set up. This minimises the chances of human error and ensures consistency and accuracy every time.\n\nEach press brake at Samin Sheet Metal holds an extensive range of tooling ready for the simplest to the most complex component applications. \nAs a result the saving in time is passed onto our customers.\n\nSamin Sheet Metal have been investing in and upgrading our press brakes constantly to ensure our customers benefit from..\n\n- fast turnaround times, \n- high levels of accuracy and consistency with finished product\n- as well as excellent value for money.\n\nThe multi axis press brakes are just ONE of the important steps in the process that assists Samin Sheet Metal with manufacturing and assembling a wide variety of products made from many different materials. \n\nSamin -- excellence in metal components..\n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/user/SaminSheetMetal\nGoogle+ Samin Sheet Metal - https://plus.google.com/+SaminSheetMetalMeadowbrook\nGoogle+ Wade Samin - https://plus.google.com/103646583249876178983/about\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/SaminSheetMetal    \nLinkedIn - http://www.linkedin.com/company/samin-sheet-metal-pty-ltd\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/SaminSheetMetal", "title": "SAMIN Sheet Metal CNC Press Brake", "publishedDate": "2013-06-18T08:08:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ba-TNvQxz_8", "description": "A pregnant Texas actress who initially told FBI agents her husband had sent ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been arrested.

So it's completely understandable for anyone to \ndismiss Brain 2.0 as just another run-of-the-mill self-help product\nlost in the thousands of products available in the market out there.\n\nBut that's where you would be mistaken:\n\nBrain 2.0 is the brainchild of Greg Frost, a guru in the self-\nimprovement field who has already released hundreds of products\ninto the market since his foray in the self-help business years ago.\n\nWith Brain 2.0, he's gone a different route compared to his other\nproducts that are based on subliminal technology. That's because\nthis time round he has integrated his proprietary brainwave\nentrainment  technology called MAX-TREX into the Unlimited\nBrainpower MP3, which is just one of the components in the\nBrain 2.0 system.\nWhat the MAX-TREX technology does is to basically trigger\na process in a person's brain that's called a Cortical Evoked\nResponse, which enables users of the MP3 to enter states\nof heightened cerebral activities and unleash various mental\ncapabilities that mentally they wouldn't normally have access\nto. These can range from greater intelligence, to  enhanced\nmemory retention abilities, or even hyper awareness of the\nenvironment around them.\n\nThis brainwave entrainment MP3 could arguably be the main \nselling point of the system, as it has proven to be the most effective tool within the Brain 2.0 package. Dozens of  satisfied\ncustomers have attested to the MP3's effectiveness, citing\nthat they've seen results in just one or two weeks of continuous use.\nThe other components that make up the Brain 2.0 package\nhappens to be a very detailed eBook, and an accompanying\nprocess map that summarizes the main subjects addressed in\nthe eBook. While comprehensive, concise, and a very  interesting read, I personally preferred the Ultimate Brainpower MP3, because\nI'm not an avid reader. But for those of you who do love  interesting read that you may find extremely beneficial once you've\napplied the concepts taught.\n\nIf you're as keen as I am about self-help, then Brain 2.0 is the one\nself-help product you'll regret missing out on. Being an avid self-\nimprovement enthusiast, I've seen dozens of products out there\nthat promise the same thing; better memory, better confidence,\nbetter everything. But just as there are dozens of such products,\nthere are about the same number of products that under deliver.\n\nThough the effectiveness of the eBook may have been influenced \nby the concurrent use of the brainwave entrainment MP3. I must\nsay that I noticed a significant difference in my  attention span,\nalertness, spatial awareness, and memory retention within just\ntwo weeks of using the MP3 (on an on-off basis).\n\nAs jaded as I am about other self-help products out there, I have\nto say that Brain 2.0 might be the best product I've seen in a while, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking to\nimprove themselves to get that much closer to their own personal\nsuccesses. http://superbehealth.biz/brainwave\n\nOther helpful Keywords\n\nmemory enhancement\nmind machine  \nbrain enhancement\nmindpower\nmind improvement games \nhow does the brain function\nhow the human brain works\nbrain enhancement  \nsubliminals \nisochronic tones  \nbrain activity\nhow to increase brain power\nmind machine\ntheta waves  \nthe mind\nsubconscious mind power\nmind powers\nthe power of the subconscious mind\npower of the subconscious mind  \nthe power of your subconscious mind  \nsubliminal messaging\nincrease brain power\nbrainwave entrainment MP3\nbrain 2.0\nbrainpower MP3\nself-improvement enthusiast\nbinaural brainwave entrainment\nbrainwave entrainment cd\ngamma brainwave entrainment\ntheta meditation\nsubconscious mind control techniques\nbrainwave wiki\nsubconscious mind unconscious mind\nhidden brain power\nbrainwave entrainment technology\nsubliminal programs\nisochronic brainwave entrainment\nbrainwave entrainment isochronic\nself help subliminals\nself help subliminals\njoseph murphy the power of your subconscious mind\npower of your subconscious mind joseph murphy\nusing the subconscious mind\ninner mind power\nsubconscious mind control\nthe miracle of mind power\nhidden powers of the mind\nhttp://youtu.be/BaKCRFu5QMs", "title": "Brainwave entrainment|brain training|train your brain|self-improvement|alpha waves|mind control", "publishedDate": "2014-03-19T23:13:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaKGKO9miaM", "description": "A decent flight path for the Collect Flags mission at the San Andreas Flight School to get the gold in just under 2 minutes.", "title": "[GTA:O] San Andreas Flight School - Collect Flags (01:57.230)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T04:53:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaKJFv2g5W8", "description": "Eugenia axillaris pitanga plant with some unripe fruits.", "title": "IMGP0464", "publishedDate": "2009-05-02T22:36:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaK_0tVEDq4", "description": "", "title": "Rita Sakellariou - \u03a4\u03bf \u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c0\u0384\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce", "publishedDate": "2010-11-22T15:18:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaKse5p90jg", "description": "mods", "title": "omegle short", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T12:04:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaLFSmaCoRU", "description": "Link:http://www.minideal.net/nillkin-super-shield-matte-red-rice-and-red-rice-1s-phone-protective-shell.html\nNILLKIN super shield matte hongmi/red rice and red rice 1S phone protective shell", "title": "NILLKIN Super Frosted Shield Case for XiaoMi HongMI Red Rice 1S with screen protector", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T01:18:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaLLQnovsDE", "description": "", "title": "Verena Delius (Fox&Sheep) - Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator Interview", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T17:36:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "BaLZhCKVolQ", "description": "Music video by Sting performing 25 Years: Upbringing.

Images and video have appeared that show off the 4.7\" and 5.5\" version of the iPhone 6 variant. More details in the video.\n\nThe iPhone 6 leak video shows off the final design along with other details.\n\nWe've already seen plenty of iPhone 6 dummy units and even a few photos of what might actually be the upcoming smartphone, but a new video from Mac Otakara offers our first up-close look at the device. Another report also suggests Apple will mix up its storage offerings for the first time in years with the iPhone 6 this fall.\n\nThe video below shows the alleged iPhone 6 rear shell next to a pair of dummy units and the real iPhone 5s. The hardware design of the mockups and the leaked unit matches up perfectly, suggesting that rounded shape could be legitimate. The inside of the back panel doesn't reveal much, but certainly looks like the real deal with lots of grooves and details where internal components would presumably sit.\n\nMeanwhile, a new report from Chinese blog Feng suggests Apple may offer a 128GB iPhone 6 variant this year, though only for its rumored 5.5-inch model.", "title": "The Air Dock.

The shapes differ from the almost cylindrical to the barrel. The manner of stretching the hide over the mouths and lacing also varies. It suspended from the neck, tied to the waist and kept on the lap or the ground, and usually played with wooden sticks. The left side is coated to give it a heavier sound. Drum beats are an integral part of Durga Puja.\n\nDurga Puja  also referred to as Durgotsava or Sharadotsav is an annual Hindu festival in South Asia that celebrates worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. It refers to all the six days observed as Mahalaya, Shashthi, Maha Saptami, Maha Ashtami, Maha Navami and Vijayadashami. The dates of Durga Puja celebrations are set according to the traditional Hindu calendar and the fortnight corresponding to the festival is called Devi Paksha. Devi Paksha is preceded by Mahalaya, the last day of the previous fortnight Pitri Paksha, ('Fortnight of the Forefathers'), and is ended on Kojagori Lokkhi Puja.\n\nDurga Puja is widely celebrated in the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Tripura and West Bengal, where it is a five-day annual holiday. In West Bengal and Tripura, which has a majority of Bengali Hindus, it is the biggest festival of the year. Not only is it the biggest Hindu festival celebrated throughout the state, it is also the most significant socio-cultural event in Bengali society. Apart from eastern India, Durga Puja is also celebrated in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Durga Puja is also celebrated as a major festival in Nepal and in Bangladesh all over the places of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra and other major places and all the villages of Bangladesh where the 20% population is Hindu.3 day National Holiday is being declared and most of the educational institutions remain closed as it is one of the major national festival also in Bangladesh which is widely celebrated and peoples from all religion participate in the program.\n\nThe prominence of Durga Puja increased gradually during the British Raj in Bengal. After the Hindu reformists identified Durga with India, she became an icon for the Indian independence movement. In the first quarter of the 20th century, the tradition of Baroyari or Community Puja was popularised due to this. After independence, Durga Puja became one of the largest celebrated festivals in the whole world.\n\nDurga Puja also includes the worship of Shiva, who is Durga's consort (Durga is an aspect of Goddess Parvati), in addition to Lakshmi, Saraswati with Ganesha and Kartikeya, who are considered to be Durga's children. Worship of mother nature is done, through nine types of plant (called \"Kala Bou\"), including a plantain (banana) tree, which represent nine divine forms of Goddess Durga. Modern traditions have come to include the display of decorated pandals and artistically depicted idols (murti) of Durga, exchange of Vijaya greetings and publication of Puja Annuals.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Have you ever watched Ashley, Brad, or any one of their over-eager, would-be suitors making total asses out of themselves on national TV and thought, \"Wait a minute, I could totally do that?\" Well guess what... yes you can!\n\nSince The Bachelor and Bachelorette are the ratings equivalent of liquid gold, ABC is permanently scouring our great, reality TV-lovin' nation for doe-eyed singles who are more than ready to throw their hearts on the line for a shot at \u2014  well, if not love, then at least 15 minutes of fame.\n\nIf the network isn't currently holding open cattle calls \u2014 and those cities and dates are always posted on ABC.com \u2014 all of you eager-beaver romantics can easily send in applications by email or snail mail.\n\nBut guess what. Even though your gorgeous glamour shots might scream \"Just cast me, already!!\", if you don't bother sending in a personal video, chances are your application's gonna get tossed into the ol' ABC recycling bin. All of the video requirements are up on the website \u2014 but it's definitely worth pointing out the most bold-faced rules like, \"Put your name on your video\" and \"Make sure to send in a DVD that actually plays.\" Oh, ABC... you're so hard to please.\n\nApplicants lucky enough to pass the first round of casting with flying colors have a 30-page background form in their future, with questions like, \"Have you ever been arrested?\" and \"Have you ever done porn?\" Assuming that you don't have a triple-X past, you'll then be whisked away to L.A. for a weekend casting intensive.\n\nBut if you're expecting a few days of Hollywood sightseeing, or quality time stalking your favorite Real Housewife of Beverly Hills... then you, my friend, are in for one rude awakening. You'll essentially be on lockdown in a hotel room, with a production handler as your only connection to the outside world. On Day 1, you'll be greeted with another 30-page questionnaire (lucky you!), as well as a 1,000-question personality test designed to weed out the certified nutjobs from the regular cray-crays that we've grown to love on previous seasons of the show.\n\nThe real fun, though, begins on Day 2. Expect a way-intimidating screen test with the show's no-nonsense producers; a hardcore tag-teaming from a private investigator and a shrink; and a few empty test tubes, which you'll have to fill with any number of bodily fluids. Sounding romantic yet?\n\nIf you're lucky enough to pass all of those tests \u2014 and if the producers deem that you're smart-slash-hot enough for primetime \u2014 then ladies and gentlemen, get your roses ready because you've just snagged a chance at true, reality-TV love on the next season of The Bachelor or Bachelorette. And guess what... we cannot wait to see how you do. Just don't forget us little people when you make it to the top.\n\nSo now that you're up to speed on all the casting deets, head over to our Facebook page \u2014 that's http://www.Facebook.com/TheBacheloretteFansite \u2014 and let us know if you're crazy-for-love enough to apply.

El padre pronto abandon\u00f3 su familia y madre e hija se trasladaron a vivir a Langhirano, localidad pr\u00f3xima a Parma, lugar de origen de Giuseppina.\nA la edad de tres a\u00f1os se vio afectada por la poliomielitis de la que si bien se recuper\u00f3 considerablemente, le qued\u00f3 cierta dificultad para andar, lo que le impidi\u00f3 tomar parte en actividades f\u00edsicas, propias de su edad y por ello se interes\u00f3 en la m\u00fasica. Form\u00f3 parte del coro de la iglesia de Langhirano y a los trece a\u00f1os, su madre le hizo recibir clases de piano con la Signorina Pasani, en Parma. Renata trabaj\u00f3 con gran esfuerzo, practicando cuatro o cinco horas diarias, so\u00f1ando con una carrera como concertista, a la vez que cantaba cuanto llegaba a sus o\u00eddos, particularmente a trav\u00e9s de la radio. Por ello, su profesora de piano tom\u00f3 la iniciativa de ponerla en manos del profesor de canto Italo Brancucci, del conservatorio de Parma, donde pronto empez\u00f3 a recibir lecciones con Ettore Campogalliani, quien la mantuvo practicando escalas y entrenando su voz, antes de permitirle aprender sus primeras canciones, hacia el final del segundo a\u00f1o de su formaci\u00f3n como cantante.\nEl aut\u00e9ntico cambio en su carrera le lleg\u00f3 en 1946, cuando entre dudas y miedos, tuvo una audici\u00f3n en Mil\u00e1n, con Arturo Toscanini, reci\u00e9n llegado de Estados Unidos, en busca de j\u00f3venes nuevas voces. En el transcurso de la audici\u00f3n, le dijo que, para el concierto de reapertura de La Scala, tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, estaba buscando una \"voce d'angelo\", a lo que Tebaldi contest\u00f3: \"Cherchero' di fare del mio meglio, Maestro\". De esta an\u00e9cdota se deriv\u00f3 la creencia de que Toscanini la llam\u00f3 la de la \"voz de \u00e1ngel\", lo que Tebaldi neg\u00f3 en cuantas oportunidades tuvo. En ese concierto, cant\u00f3 La Oraci\u00f3n (\"Dal tuo stellato soglio\") de la \u00f3pera Mois\u00e9s en Egipto de Rossini y la parte de soprano del Te Deum de Verdi.\nPosteriormente, en el mismo a\u00f1o, cant\u00f3 los papeles de Margherita y Elena en Mefistofele y el de Elsa en Lohengrin de Wagner. El siguiente a\u00f1o cant\u00f3 La Boh\u00e8me y Eva en Los Maestros Cantores, de Wagner. Toscanini la anim\u00f3 para que cantara el papel de Aida y la invit\u00f3 para que lo ensayara en su estudio. Tebaldi estaba convencida que ese papel estaba reservado para una soprano dram\u00e1tica, pero fue persuadida por Toscanini y finalmente la cant\u00f3 en La Scala, en 1950, junto a Mario del Monaco y Fedora Barbieri, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de Antonino Votto. Su actuaci\u00f3n fue el mayor \u00e9xito de sus primeros a\u00f1os, lanz\u00e1ndola en su carrera.\nEntre otros teatros de Italia, cant\u00f3 en la \u00d3pera de Roma entre 1947 y 1962 y en la Comunale de Florencia, fue la estrella de la Scala de Mil\u00e1n, entre 1946 y 1955 con una reintr\u00e9e en la temporada 1959-60 y dos \u00faltimos recitales en 1974 y 1976. Fue la favorita del San Carlo de N\u00e1poles entre 1948 y 1962, donde volvi\u00f3 a actuar en 1967 con La Gioconda, de Amilcare Ponchielli.\nComenz\u00f3 con una gira, junto a la compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Scala, actuando en el Festival de Edimburgo y tras ello en Londres, donde debut\u00f3 en el Covent Garden, cantando el papel de Desd\u00e9mona en dos representaciones de Otello y una del R\u00e9quiem de Verdi, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de Victor de Sabata.\nTras ello, cant\u00f3 asiduamente en el Metropolitan de Nueva York y tambi\u00e9n en la \u00d3pera de San Francisco, en la de Chicago y en otros muchos teatros de Estados Unidos. Tambi\u00e9n en Alemania, Londres, Par\u00eds, Viena, Barcelona, Jap\u00f3n y Sudam\u00e9rica.\nSi bien se prodig\u00f3 en papeles melodram\u00e1ticos de la \u00f3pera verista, su repertorio fue muy amplio, incluyendo \u00f3peras de Wagner (si bien cantadas en italiano), en los papeles de Eva en Los Maestros Cantores, de Elsa en Lohengrin, y de Isabel en Tannh\u00e4user. El famoso director alem\u00e1n Karl B\u00f6hm le suplic\u00f3 que aprendiera alem\u00e1n para as\u00ed poder tomar parte en su repertorio. Tebaldi tambi\u00e9n cant\u00f3 La Pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan San Mateo de Bach e incluso grab\u00f3 el papel de Cleopatra de la \u00f3pera Julio C\u00e9sar de H\u00e4ndel.\nSus compa\u00f1eros de escena fueron los m\u00e1s grandes cantantes de la \u00e9poca, entre otros: Carlo Bergonzi, Jussi Bjoerling, Franco Corelli, Mario del Monaco, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Nicolai Gedda, Beniamino Gigli, Alfredo Kraus, Richard Tucker, Jon Vickers, Ram\u00f3n Vinay, Lauri Volpi y tantos otros.\nActu\u00f3 bajo la direcci\u00f3n de los m\u00e1s notables directores, tales como: Vladimir Ashkenazy, Leonard Bernstein, Karl B\u00f6hm, Richard Bonynge, Carlo Maria Giulini, Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Kempe, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Dmitri Mitropoulos, Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, Mario Rossi, Victor de Sabata, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Tullio Serafin, Sir Georg Solti y Arturo Toscanini.", "title": "Renata Tebaldi.

In order to achieve this, the satellites carry very stable clocks.\n \nThe Galileo satellites will carry two types of clocks: rubidium atomic frequency standards and passive hydrogen masers. The stability of the rubidium clock is so good that it would lose only three seconds in one million years, while the passive hydrogen maser is even more stable and it would lose only one second in three million years. However this kind of stability is really needed, since an error of only a few nanoseconds (billionths of a second) on the Galileo measurements would produce a positioning error of metres which would not be acceptable. \n \nAn atomic clock works like a conventional clock but the time-base of the clock, instead of being an oscillating mass as in a pendulum clock, is based on the properties of atoms when transitioning between different energy states. \n \nAn atom, when excited by an external energy source, goes to a higher energy state. Then, from this state, it goes to a lower energy state. In this transition, the atom releases energy at a very precise frequency which is characteristic of the type of atom. This is like a signature for the type of material used. All that is needed for making a good clock is a way of detecting this frequency and using it as an input to a counter. This is the principle behind an atomic clock. \n \nThe transitions between energy states can take place by releasing or absorbing energy at optical or microwave frequencies. An atomic second corresponds to 9 192 631 700 counts of the frequency of the energy detected in the transition of the Cesium 133 isotope when exposed to suitable excitation.  \n  \nRubidium clock  \n \nThe Galileo rubidium clock is made of an atomic resonator and some control electronics. Inside the atomic resonator there is a rubidium vapour cell. The atoms are kept in a gaseous state at high temperature. In order to initiate the resonance, the atoms of the cell are excited to a higher state by the light of a rubidium discharge lamp located in one end of the atomic resonator. At the other end of the resonator there is a photodiode which detects the amount of light that passes through the cell. \n \nFollowing the excitation, the atoms decay to a lower state. From this state, the atoms are excited back to an intermediate level by injecting microwave energy in the resonator at a given frequency. Transition to the intermediate level only occurs if the frequency corresponds exactly to the one associated with this transition. When the atoms are in the intermediate state, the absorption of light is at a maximum. \n \nThe output of the photodiode is connected to control circuitry which adjusts the microwave frequency. The correct frequency is maintained by tuning the microwave source to obtain maximum light absorption. The resonance is maintained by the energy from the rubidium lamp, since the atoms in the intermediate state are again excited to the higher state and then decay to the lower state, from which the whole process starts again. \n  \nHydrogen maser clock  \n \nThe Galileo passive hydrogen maser clock is also made of an atomic resonator and some control electronics. In this clock, a small storage bottle supplies molecular hydrogen to a gas discharge bulb. Here molecules of hydrogen are dissociated into atomic hydrogen. After dissociation, the atoms enter a resonance cavity by passing through a collimator and a magnetic state selector. This magnetic state selector is used to let only atoms of the desired energy level enter a resonant cavity. Here the atoms are confined in a quartz storage bulb. Once in this storage bulb the hydrogen atoms tend to return to their 'fundamental' energy state, emitting a microwave frequency as they do so. \n \nThis frequency is detected by an interrogation circuit which locks an external signal to the 'natural' transition of the hydrogen atoms. Locking occurs when the injected frequency is the same as the resonant frequency of the atoms; this corresponds to an amplification of the microwave signal. \n \nThe resonant frequency of the microwave cavity is approximately 1.420 GHz. The clock's electronics includes circuitry for the control of the frequency plus the thermal control system to maintain the resonant cavity at the correct temperature. \n \nThe atomic resonator is very sensitive to the external environment (for example, magnetic field). Great care is required to keep environmental disturbances small so that the full performance potential of these sophisticated clocks can be realized. \n \n* * *", "title": "Galileo, The Best Atomic Clock in Space", "publishedDate": "2009-05-02T20:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bb8xT9Rmve4", "description": "", "title": "\u0423\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438360", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T12:02:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bb9A6LDRgo0", "description": "", "title": "Instala\u00e7\u00e3o de Bulk Ink Epson R290 / T50", "publishedDate": "2009-09-23T12:03:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bb9x4D3f-yE", "description": "Endoscopic Animation on ulcerative colitis\nUlcerative colitis (Colitis ulcerosa, UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the colon (large intestine), that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset. IBD is often confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a troublesome, but much less serious, condition.\nUlcerative colitis has similarities to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom-free. Although the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can sometimes diminish on their own, the disease usually requires treatment to go into remission.\n\nThe clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process. Patients usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood and mucus, of gradual onset that persists for an extended period (weeks). They may also have weight loss and blood on rectal examination. The chronic loss of blood from the GI tract leads to increased rates of anaemia. The disease may be accompanied with different degrees of abdominal pain, from mild discomfort to painful bowel movements or painful abdominal cramping with bowel movements.\nUlcerative colitis is associated with a general inflammatory process that affects many parts of the body. Sometimes these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease, such as painful, arthritic knees in a teenager and may be seen in adults also. The presence of the disease may not be confirmed immediately, however, until the onset of intestinal manifestations.\n\nSeverity of disease\n\n\nColonic pseudopolyps of a patient with intractable ulcerative colitis. Colectomy specimen.\nIn addition to the extent of involvement, people may also be characterized by the severity of their disease.\nMild disease correlates with fewer than four stools daily, with or without blood, no systemic signs of toxicity, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There may be mild abdominal pain or cramping. Patients may believe they are constipated when in fact they are experiencing tenesmus, which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.\nModerate disease correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity. Patients may display anemia (not requiring transfusions), moderate abdominal pain, and low grade fever, 38 to 39 \u00b0C (100 to 102 \u00b0F).\nSevere disease, correlates with more than six bloody stools a day or observable massive and significant bloody bowel movement, and evidence of toxicity as demonstrated by fever, tachycardia, anemia or an elevated ESR.\nFulminant disease correlates with more than ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. If the serous membrane is involved, colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, fulminant disease will soon lead to death.\n\nhe best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains endoscopy. Full colonoscopy to the cecum and entry into the terminal ileum is attempted only if diagnosis of UC is unclear. Otherwise, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is sufficient to support the diagnosis. The physician may elect to limit the extent of the exam if severe colitis is encountered to minimize the risk of perforation of the colon. Endoscopic findings in ulcerative colitis include the following:\nLoss of the vascular appearance of the colon\nErythema (or redness of the mucosa) and friability of the mucosa\nSuperficial ulceration, which may be confluent, and\nPseudopolyps.\nUlcerative colitis is usually continuous from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. There is rarely peri-anal disease, but cases have been reported. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or inflammation of the rectum, to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.", "title": "Ulcerative Colitis", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T12:11:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "Bb9zJJVdUd8", "description": "\"We need to remove as many barriers as we can that put people in that position.....Affirmative action has not caused an increase in labor participation.\"", "title": "Thomas Sowell: Unemployment caused by minimum wage and labor unions!", "publishedDate": "2013-09-06T15:34:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbA0ZIC6Fgw", "description": "", "title": "Amispoppia - Maraca", "publishedDate": "2012-07-18T07:03:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbABTjfmfsw", "description": "Die Perlh\u00fchner (Numididae) sind eine Familie der H\u00fchnerv\u00f6gel (Galliformes), die vier Gattungen mit insgesamt sechs Arten umfasst.

The position of the three semicircular canals and the saccule, the utricle and the endolymphatic duct are shown in relation to other structures in the inner ear.  A cross section of the semicircular canals, which consist of three tubes, are positioned at right angles to each other in different planes.  They are filled with a fluid known as endolymph.  In the base of each semicircular canal are hairlike receptors.  Any movement of the head causes the fluid within the canals to move and so stimulate the receptors to send information to the brain about the direction of the particular movement that has occurred.  The utricle and saccule contain receptor cells with tiny stones of calcium carbonate-otoliths.  The otoliths are relatively mobile and movement of the head causes them to move.  This changes the pressure that they exert on the receptors, which then send information about the direction of the head's movement to the brain, and illustrate the three planes of movement in which the head and body can move to stimulate the receptors in the semicircular canals.", "title": "How the Body Works :The Organs of Balance", "publishedDate": "2007-08-03T08:21:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbKdSmcarDo", "description": "Get The Fuck Out of Cleveland, Ohio.", "title": "GRANICUS cLEvELAnd oHiO 73", "publishedDate": "2009-09-01T09:45:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "BbKfCNfCtk8", "description": "Lactarius deliciosus.

He finished off his masterpiece with the phrase 'I luv cock' under the poorly sketched image. \n\nBrady told Lord to cover up the tattoo, then they punched him again and threw him out. The victim then showed the friend the image and it was then that he learned of his so-called friends' prank.\n\nBrady was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended after three months, and three years probation. For his part, Lord was sentenced to 12 months prison, with a parole release in March.\n\nThe victim received a new tattoo to cover up the old one from Ultimate Image Tattooing in Ipswich.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.
