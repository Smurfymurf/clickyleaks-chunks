Its species name refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of color on its fur. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns. It stands 5--6 m (16--20 ft) tall and has an average weight of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) for males and 830 kg (1,800 lb) for females. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.\n\nThe giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are preyed on by lions, and calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through \"necking\", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.\n\nThe giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern, but has been extirpated from many parts of its former range, and some subspecies are classified as Endangered. Nevertheless, giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves.\n\nFully grown giraffes stand 5--6 m (16--20 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,630 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,830 lb) for an adult female. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height. Giraffes see in color and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants. The giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 50 cm (20 in) long. It is purplish-black in color, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose. The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging. The lips, tongue and inside of the mouth are covered in papillae to protect against thorns.\n\nThe coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown or nearly black in color) separated by light hair (usually white or cream in color). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern serves as camouflage, allowing it to blend in the light and shade patterns of savanna woodlands. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern. The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray. It is also thick and allows it to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odor than the females, the odor may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.

Their first single, \"Stay.\" made a great deal of headway on the Swiss charts -- a feat that no other hard rock band had ever accomplished in that country. Essentially a power trio consisting of Vittorio \"Vic\" Vergeat (guitar/vocals), Werner Frohlich (bass) and Cosimo Lampis (drums), Toad enlisted the help of vocalist Bens Jaeger for this (and only this) album. Heavily blues-based rock (\u00e0 la Cream/Black Sabbath) was the major force behind Toad's hard driving sound, with bassist Frohlich providing a mean (and meanderingly gutsy) counterpoint to Vergeat's loose and greasy guitar licks. The record also has moments of Deep Purple-like propulsion, no doubt thanks to that band's engineer Martin Birch, who manned the controls on this one as well. Like most of the B-list (sometimes C-list) rock groups that Italian imprint Akarma has reissued throughout the early 2000s,Toad 's debut was mainly a collector's object in its LP form. There were better bands out there, doing the same sort of thing, but, chances are, those records were already on the shelves of most die-hard collectors. Albums likeToad may have enjoyed regional success in their time, but were largely forgotten or relegated to \"closet classic\" status (if they were remembered at all). These types of records have been fetching higherand higher prices over the years and it's darn good to see a reissue label dipping into this pool of underappreciated groups. In fact, if you have an appetite for this sort of thing, Akarma's reissue lineup really can't be beat -- plus, they'll save you from getting all that funky record-sleeve-mold on your fingers while you spend months searching for the (rare, rare, rare) original vinyl editions. by J.

It exposes the eye to small laser burns in order to decrease and slow down leakage of fluid, stabilizing vision and potentially preventing further vision loss. However, it is unlikely to improve vision and comes with the risk of scarring the retina. \n\nIn cases when too much blood has leaked into the vitreous of the eye, a small surgery called a vitrectomy can improve vision by replacing the vitreous with a salt solution and therefore removing excess blood. However, this may offer only temporary relief because it does not stop blood vessels from leaking further.\n\nCorticosteroids, which are received through intravitreal injection or by sustained release implants, can improve vision by interfering with the mechanisms that cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels. However, their benefits may be short-lived and come with the risk of other eye complications such as cataracts or elevated intraocular pressure, which is a major risk factor for glaucoma. \n\nA major development in treating vision loss in DME patients has been the introduction of anti-VEGF drugs, which leverage recent advances in our understanding of the different mechanisms that cause DME.\n\nOver-expression of the protein VEGF, or vascular endothelial growth factor, has been shown to play a major role in the development of diabetic macular edema. In DME, VEGF is produced at higher than normal amounts in the retina, which causes blood vessels to become weak and leaky. Anti-VEGF drugs are designed to target and block VEGF. Lowering abnormal levels of VEGF reduces harmful effects on blood vessels. This decreases leakage of fluid, reduces edema, and can stabilize or even improve vision\u2026 all with lower risk for developing other major eye conditions that are associated with some other treatments.\n\nAnti-VEGF treatment is received as an injection directly into the eye. There are three major responses to anti-VEGF treatment: \n\u2022 Reduced vascular permeability, so that the vessel wall is not as penetrable and leakage of fluid is minimized or completely stopped,\n\u2022 Reduction in edema and decreased thickening of the macula and retina,\nAnd, as a result\u2026\n\u2022 Improved vision with benefits outperforming that of other treatments. \n\nBecause of its positive results for DME patients and a lower risk for other eye complications, anti-VEGF therapy has become the preferred treatment for DME. Responses to anti-VEGF therapy may vary and treatment may be continued long-term to maintain benefits. Combination therapy may also be beneficial for some patients. \n\nIf you are diagnosed with DME, you have options. Work with an eye care specialist who is experienced in treating and managing DME, and ask them if anti-VEGF therapy is the best option for you. Knowledge and understanding of your condition empowers you to take an active role in choosing and managing your treatment.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Bed in Summer by Robert Louis Stevenson copy", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T21:55:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Qkhbu5K1mM", "description": "The Stormlands\n\nThe Stormlands are named after the vicious storms that constantly maul the coastline and cause frequent rainy and windy weather.

While primarily a drummer he took on the role of front man in the band while Alan Lee Shaw played guitar and wrote the songs. Songs at the time included a mix of originals and Fairies numbers.  Rod Latter played drums (later to join the Adverts). The band was completed by Dennis Stow on bass. A one off deal with Chiswick brought the excellent single I Wanna Be Free / Automobile in May 1977. Band played all the usual 'toilets' like the 100 Club and Roxy.\n\"When your health is so shot that you don't look at the bar for fear your liver might explode, an ex hippy and pink fairy fronting a ...new wave band is not even funny.

The truth is probably somewhere in between if this quote from a live review is anything to go by: \"...a fine band. Except for the singer...Most of the set he spent at the back of the stage trying to evade the gobbing...surely within reason one should take it?

Punch down, divide in half, then divide each half into 3 portions.\n\nRoll each portion into a snake, then braid into 2 loaves. Tuck in the ends well so they don't come undone while baking.

Anti-authority cyberbullying is a form of workplace bullying that impacts the adult victim in both his / her professional and personal life. How these impacts are dealt with, solved and or resolved has consequences on the school administrators' psychological, financial and physical health and on his / her career expectations and future employment opportunities. AACB has its antecedents in the relationships, organizational structure and policies, and events of the school and is the result of a process that escalates over time (Einersen 1999; Leymann, 1996). Because AACB is not an isolated, accidental or disconnected event, it can be understood as a convergence of different processes, priorities, perceptions, procedures and principles in the workplace of school administrators (Soares, 2002). Canadian and Quebec laws that govern how, and the impacts of the education institutional governing structures' response to AACB events, and AACB victims' perceptions of the efficacy and justice of the responses to the AACB events, is the subject of the author's research to be presented.\n\nBecause upwards of 25% of K-12 students in Canada, Britain, Australia and the United States report being victims of cyberbullying; because of documented cases of child and adolescent suicide due to cyberbullying victimization; because the antecedents of cyberbullying events are often found in the face to face environment of the students' school; schools and their governing structures such as school boards or districts should implement both proactive and reactive anti-cyberbullying programs and strategies. These programs and strategies should address underlying causes, the teaching of pro-social ethical and responsible cyber citizenship, professional development for teachers and school administrators, and the sustainability of caring, respectful and inclusive learning communities. Reactive strategies must not only provide consequences for the cyberbullies and their henchmen but must also provide support, rehabilitation and healing for the victim and the perpetrator. Both the proactive and reactive programs and strategies must continuously be renewed so as to respond to the evolving ICT mediated life and cyber environment of the students.

Subscribe for other quote recommendations.\n\nManius Curius Dentatus (died 270 BC), son of Manius, was a three-time consul and a plebeian hero of the Roman Republic, noted for ending the Samnite War. According to Pliny, he was born with teeth, thus earning the cognomen Dentatus, \"Toothy.\"[1]\n\nDentatus was a tribune of the plebs sometime between 298 and 291 BC. As tribune, he foiled efforts by the interrex Appius Claudius Caecus to keep plebeian candidates out of the consular elections. If his tribunate is dated to 291, his actions advanced his own candidacy, but since Appius served three times as interrex, the earliest date accords better with the timeline of Dentatus's own career.[2]\n\nDentatus served his first term as consul in 290 BC, during which time he defeated both the Samnites and Sabines and celebrated two triumphs.[3] Returning home he took on a massive public works project, partly draining Lake Velinus.\n\nIn 283, Dentatus filled the praetorship (or possibly the consulship) of L. Caecilius Metellus Denter after the latter was killed in the Battle of Arretium. Polybius says Dentatus drove the Gauls from their territory, clearing the way for the establishment of a colony at Sena.\n\nAs consul again in 275 BC, Dentatus fought Pyrrhus in the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum which nevertheless forced Pyrrhus out of Italy. As a result, he held a consecutive consulship, defeating the Lucani in the following year and earning an ovation. He was censor in 272, and in 270 he was elected as one of two commissioners[4] to oversee construction of the Anio Vetus, Rome's second aqueduct, for which he used his personal share of the booty from his recent victories.[5] He died during the project, which was completed under his fellow commissioner M. Fulvius Flaccus.[6]\n\nDentatus is supposed to have been incorruptible and frugal; the story was that when the Samnites sent ambassadors with expensive gifts in an attempt to influence him in their favor, they found him sitting by the hearth roasting turnips. He refused the gifts, saying that he preferred ruling the possessors of gold over possessing it himself.[7] Although the truth of this story is unclear \u2014 it may have been an invention of Cato \u2014 it was the inspiration for a number of paintings by Jacopo Amigoni, Govert Flinck, and others.

It is a behavior or trick that is a variation on what we often refer to as \"beg\" or \"sit pretty\". For Jack, he does better with a \"stick 'em up\" because it helps balance out his body composition a little bit. He's very heavy in the front. \n\nSo what we're going to do is look for small variation on what the end result will be. Whenever you're training any behavior, what you want to know is what the end behavior is supposed to look like, and then you're just looking at what the dog does and breaking it down into small, achievable steps. What I definitely want to communicate to him when I'm training this is that I want his rear end on the ground and I want to see his paws start to come up.\n\nSo I'm going to use a clicker to communicate to him what he's done correctly, what he's getting a reward for. And slowly, I will shape him to the end result. So it's perfect that he's in a sitting position. That's what we need. I might click just to sit a couple times and reward it. So I click what he's doing right and I reward it. I'm just going to wait to see if he does anything with his feet. I'll even take that little stepping with his feet a little bit. I just wait for him, see if he offers anything. I took that.\n\nIt's a little bit of a waiting game.\n\nYes, good job. I'm looking for those paws to raise up. He's being a real good boy just offering me a sit. I can encourage it a little bit by kind of pressing my hand up and back. Good boy. I'm going to try to click when the paws come up as high as they can.  Good job. I might go for a little duration. And when I feel like it looks like what I want it to, I can start throwing in a cue, when I feel fairly certain he's going to offer it. I like to use my finger, like I'm pointing a gun at him. Stick 'em up. Good. You want to show him the cue and then get the behavior. Good. Good job, Jack.\n\nNow to make sure he understands that cue, I might throw in a few things that I know that he knows, such as a \"down\". Good. Ask him to sit. Good. I'm going to make sure he's making the connection between the stick 'em up behavior and the cue. I'll try that one. Stick 'em up. Yes, good job.

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

Man sch\u00e4tzt diese Pflanzen wegen ihrer auffallenden, gl\u00e4nzenden Blatter und ihrer aparten Bl\u00fcten. Die in Wohnungskultur gepflegten Pflanzen sind meist Hybriden.\n\nSpathiphyllum-Hybriden als Zimmerpflanzen\nAlle Pflanzen der Gattung Spathiphyllum haben einen sehr kurzen, nicht oder nur wenig \u00fcber die Erde hervortretenden Stamm, aus dem sich in B\u00fcscheln l\u00e4ngliche oder lanzettliche, dunkelgr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbte Blatter entwickeln. Die Bl\u00fcten bilden sich meist im Fr\u00fchjahr und Sommer, sie k\u00f6nnen jedoch auch zu anderen Jahreszeiten ausbilden.\n\nDie h\u00fcbschen Bl\u00fcten der Spathiphyllum\nDie Bl\u00fcten einer Spathiphyllum ragen an langen Sch\u00e4ften auf und ragen weit \u00fcber die dunkelgr\u00fcnen Bl\u00e4tter der Pflanze hinaus. Der Bl\u00fctenstand einer Spathiphyllum besteht aus einem gro\u00dfen, wei\u00dfen H\u00fcllblatt, der sogenannten Spatha, welche einen aufrechten, wei\u00dfen, cremefarbenen oder gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fctenkolben umgibt.\n\nDie bei den meisten Arten duftenden Bl\u00fcten sind nur etwa eine Woche lang wei\u00df. Danach verf\u00e4rbt sich das H\u00fcllblatt langsam hellgr\u00fcn und bietet weitere 5 bis 6 Wochen einen h\u00fcbschen Anblick.\n\nSpathiphyllum wallisii mit Hybriden\nSpathiphyllum wallisii ist die einzige in Wohnungskultur gepflegte Art. Die etwa 7 cm breiten und 20 cm langen Bl\u00e4tter dieser Pflanze bilden sich an ca. 15 cm langen Stielen. Die aparten Bl\u00fcten bilden sich im Fr\u00fchjahr und bei guten Kulturbedingungen nochmals im Sp\u00e4tsommer. Der Bl\u00fctenschaft erreicht eine L\u00e4nge von 25 cm, der cremefarbene Bl\u00fctenkolben w\u00e4chst aufrecht aus der Basis des etwa 10 cm langen und 5 cm breiten H\u00fcllblatts. Von der Spathiphyllum wallisii gibt es im Handel zahlreiche Hybriden mit unterschiedlichen Bl\u00fcten.\n\nHinweise zur Spathiphyllum\nBei niedriger Luftfeuchtigkeit neigt die Spathiphyllum zu einem Befall durch die Rote Spinne. Man bespr\u00fcht die Bl\u00e4tter deshalb \u00f6fters mit Wasser und kontrolliert die Blattunterseiten regelm\u00e4\u00dfig, da sich meist dort die Spinnmilben ansiedeln.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Spathiphyllum\nLicht / Standort\n\nDie Spathiphyllum wird an einem hellen Standort kultiviert. Die Pflanze muss vor der direkten Sonnenbestrahlung gesch\u00fctzt werden, ansonsten kommt es zu Sch\u00e4den an den Bl\u00e4ttern.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nMan w\u00e4ssert die Spathiphyllum gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig, zwischen den einzelnen Wassergaben l\u00e4sst man die obere Erdschicht etwas antrocknen. Bei Temperaturen unter 15 \u00b0C schr\u00e4nkt man die Menge des Gie\u00dfwassers ein und man befeuchtet den Ballen nur ein wenig.  Vorsicht, das Substrat der Spathiphyllum  darf niemals vollst\u00e4ndig trocken werden.\nTemperatur\n\nF\u00fcr die Kultivierung eignen sich normale Wohnungstemperaturen. Die gerade noch vertr\u00e4gliche Mindesttemperatur liegt bei etwa 13 \u00b0C. Die aus den Tropen stammenden Pflanzen reagieren sehr empfindlich auf trockene Luft. Man stellt die T\u00f6pfe deshalb am besten auf mit Wasser und Steinen gef\u00fcllte unterschalen. Wenn die Temperaturen unter 18 \u00b0C fallen, verlangsamt sich das Wachstum der Spathiphyllum erheblich.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nIm Fr\u00fchjahr kann man die Pflanzen durch die Teilung der dichten Blattb\u00fcschel vermehren.

They visit the Phobhjikha valley in large numbers, which is a declared protected area for the cranes, and also to other valleys in smaller numbers in central and eastern Bhutan. On arrival in the Phobhjikha (also called the 'Gangtey Valley') they are seen to circle the Gangteng Monastery (also known as Gangten Gonpa) three times as if they are paying obeisance to the gods in the monastery and repeat this act while returning to Tibet \u0456n early spring. The Jigme Dorji Wongchuk Sanctuary, adjoining the Phobjika Valley across the Black Mountains Range, has within its precincts, the crane wintering area at Bumdeling, which also has been declared a protected area. \n\nThese cranes known by the binomial name Grus nigricollis and also as Tibetan Crane are categorized as Vulnerable (Vu) in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species maintained by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) under Appendix I and II of CITES. The Black-necked Cranes, the last to be found among the 16 species of cranes, were first identified by Nikolai Przhevalsky of the Imperial Russian Army in 1876 in the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nApart from China and India, Bhutan has taken special care to protect this species and has established the Phobjikha Conservation Area covering 163 square kilometres (63 sq mi) of the valley under the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN) and for the purpose of conservation management. The conservation area was established by Bhutan in the Phobjika Valley in 2003, and RSPN has the mandate to protect not only the Black-necked Cranes but also 13 other vulnerable species. The cranes, which used to be hunted in Bhutan till 1980 are now totally protected, with the Government of Bhutan enacting a law under which any person killing a crane would invite life term jail sentence.\n\nIn Bhutan, the Black-necked Cranes have a celebrity status, as witnessed by the Crane Festival held every year on 12 November, soon after their arrival from the Tibetan Plateau, in the courtyards of the Gangten Gonpa in Phobjika Valley. Many tourists also visit the valley to witness this festival.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Expand to find out.\n\nHere's the link to the article:\nhttp://parenting-academy.com/whats-your-parenting-style/\n\nToday we are talking about different Parenting Styles! Your parenting style refers to the set of strategies you use to raise and discipline your children. And according to recent studies, different parenting styles tend to impact our kids in different ways.\n\nToday I'm going to talk about the three basic styles of parenting:\n\nAutocratic, Democratic, and Permissive.\n\nI'm going to describe each style, and as I do, think about what style you were raised in and then think about the style you might be raising your kids with today! \n\nFirst style is AUTOCRATIC PARENTING:\nAutocratic parents love rules. They're often very strict about these rules and don't really feel the need to explain the reasoning behind them. If their children fail to obey, they are punished. What an autocratic parent says is the law and a child has little to no input. \n\nAn autocratic parent's motto is, \"Because I said so.\" \n\nStudies have shown that kids raised in an autocratic style tend to be obedient and competent, but they rank lower in happiness , social skills, and confidence.\n\nThen there's DEMOCRATIC PARENTING:\nDemocratic parents like rules too, but as the name would imply-- they are more responsive to their kids questions, are more willling to work together with their children toward solutions. When expectations are not met, a democratic parent will coach their kids toward the desired behavior, rather than punishing them until expectations are met. Democratic parents are both firm and kind.\n\nA democratic parent's motto would be, \"How can we make this work for both of us?\"\n\nChildren raised by democratic parents tend to be happy, capable. and successful, according to some studies.\n\nThe third basic style of parenting is PERMISSIVE.\nPermissive parents don't really have any rules for their children. They do not discipline their kids and in fact avoid confrontation with their own children.  Although they can appear outwardly very nurturing,, they are often indulgent and have low expectations of their children's ability to be mature and exercise self-control. \n\nA permissive parent's motto would be, \"I want to be my child's best friend!\"\nAccording to some studies, kids with permissive parents often perform poorly in school and demonstrate poor self-regulation. And despite their parents attempts to keep them happy, often rank lower in happiness as well.\n\nIs one style of parenting better than another? Here at Parenting-Academy.com, we definitely favor the democratic style of parenting, and that's what we think we should strive for.\n\nBut in reality, moms and dads are kind of a mixture of styles. I'm a mostly democratic parent with autocratic tendencies about certain things, probably because I was raised by autocratic parents.\n\nEven within the same family, you'll often see different parenting style.\n\nWhat Parenting Style do you use? Are you a combination of styles? Do you agree with the results of some these studies? Let me know in the comments section below! \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Positive Parenting, we invite you to check out two of our positive parenting courses. \n\nPositive Discipline Online Class:\nhttp://online-class.positivediscipline.com/sp/27375-the-positive-discipline-online-class\n\nRedirecting Children's Behavior Online Course:\nhttp://www.redirectingchildrensbehavioronlinecourse.com/sp/12080-redirecting-childrens-behavior-online-class-piyh\n\nOr sign up to receive FREE video clips straight from our catalog of positive parenting online classes.\nhttp://free-online-parenting-lessons.parenting-academy.com/\n\nRemember, there's no such thing as a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a great one!

He performed with Billy Lee Riley and Brad Suggs but then in 1959 joined the original Bill Black Combo, recording for the Hi label. He stayed with the band until 1961, when he made his solo chart debut with the instrumental \"Tuff,\" which made it to the country Top 20. This in turn was followed by a Top 40 hit, \"Blues (Stay Away From Me),\" and a minor hit for the Santos label, \"Sugar Blues.\" He had two more hits in the mid-'60s with \"Cotton Fields\" and \"Searchin',\" both recorded for Hi. A decade later, he became the subject of the 1974 documentary film, Ace's High. After moving to Nashville in the mid-'70s, Cannon's version of \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" became a minor hit and was nominated for the Best Country Instrumental Performance Grammy that year. Cannon continued to perform into the '90s and frequently toured with such legends of early rock & roll as Carl Perkins.  ~ Sandra Brennan, All Music Guide\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

So when you skate backwards your toes are actually going to point together.  So don't look down at your feet, because they're your feet, you should know what you're doing, but look down just once, make sure your toes are pointing together and knees bent, and then look back up.  If you need some place to put your hands, put them on your hips so that they don't distract you from what's going on, or cause you to fall down.\n\nFirst off, starting off backwards is starting off with walking.  So start with toes together and take little steps, keeping your core engaged, keeping your thigh muscles pulled together, and toes together.  As you start rolling, just keep pushing until you want to.  So roller skating backwards can start with two toes together, knees bent with small steps backwards.  Once you get rolling you'll actually start to push, and then back to your powerbox, push, back to your powerbox, push, and stop.\n\nThe next thing with backwards skating is always keeping your chest a little bit forward over your knees.  Once your chest comes back here, then it's really easy to fall backwards, so always keep you knees bent, and push your butt out, push your chest forward, and you'll be in the right position.  So again, pushing out, rolling, bringing them back together, and then scissors is more advanced where you're pushing both feet at the same time.  So that's where you push out and in, push out and in, and then you can stop in your T position as well.\n\nAnd those are some tips on your backward skating, so make sure you keep you knees bent, chest forward, and good luck with your backward skating.", "title": "How to Skate Backwards | Roller-Skate", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T23:15:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2RduVkpeMnw", "description": "http://www.smallscreennetwork.comSign up for the Small Screen Email Newsletter: http://vid.io/xdM \nBe the first to know when new episodes air on our site!\n\nHow to Make a Swizzle\n\nThe swizzle, a style of cocktail utilizing crushed ice, typically made with rum and given a good mixing with a swizzle stick, is a perfect drink for the approaching Summer.

Pregnant women should not use acupressure. \n\nStep 1: Press beneath your collarbone\nUsing the index and middle fingers on each hand, press the two spots located on either side of the notch at the base of the throat, in the hollow just below the collarbone. This strengthens the respiratory system. Keep the pressure up for one to three minutes with this exercise and the following ones. \n\nStep 2: Reach behind you\nReach behind you to press the acupressure points known as the Vital Diaphragm, located about an inch below the highest point of each shoulder blade, toward the center of your back. \n\nTip\nHave someone else press points on your back if you can't reach. \n\nStep 3: Tilt your head down\nTilt your head down and, using the first two fingers on each hand, put pressure on the points a bit above and on either side of the vertabra that protrudes at the top of the spine when your head is leaning forward. This manipulates the point known as Ding Chuan, which relieves wheezing. \n\nStep 4: Relieve a dry cough\nFor a dry cough, try pressing the point called Heaven Rushing Out: It\u2019s located in the large hollow at the base of your throat, below your Adam's apple, if you're a man. \n\nDid You Know?\nChronic coughing that is the result of emotional problems is called psychogenic coughing, and mostly occurs in children.", "title": "How to Stop a Cough with Acupressure", "publishedDate": "2010-08-18T23:18:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SDq7e3Tq1s", "description": "Tema: Cita con el Mic\nArtista: Resistencia Feat A.C.R.I.S.\nAlbum: Acristencia\nA\u00f1o: 2014\nProd: Acristiamusic", "title": "03.

If I crossed the pool with 7 scissor kicks on my right side, I wanted to also cross the pool with 7 scissor kicks on my left side.  But usually it didn't happen that way.  During most of my swims, I wound up doing more strokes and kicks on my left side than on my right side.  \n\nIn this video, when I'm swimming on my right side I do 7 scissor kicks, but when I'm swimming on my left side, 8 scissor kicks.\n\nOnly after studying several \"feedback\" videos like this one very closely did I notice that I was pushing off the wall more strongly on my right side than on my left side.  On my right side, I glided further out into the pool before beginning my first stroke.  On the left side, I didn't glide out as far before beginning my first stroke, therefore I had to do more strokes to cover the extra distance. \n\nOnce I noticed this discrepancy in my push off the wall, I worked on correcting it, and sure enough, by the end of the summer, I was able to cross the pool with 7 scissor kicks on my right side, as well as on my left side.\n\nThat's the value of making \"feedback\" videos such as these.  They help me see my body from outside myself - - like an impartial observer, or a coach might watch me from the sidelines.  While I'm busy swimming, I can't also analyze my strokes from the outside.  But when I'm no longer in the pool, when I'm watching my video on a computer monitor, I see myself from a completely different perspective.\n\nThe first time I was able to do the sidestroke symmetrically, 7 strokes on each side, was on Sept 1st, but my camera wasn't running at the time.  \n\nOn Sept. 5th, the last day this outdoor pool was open, I got a chance to record a few more feedback videos.  In the video at this URL\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbcjDuwgVeY\nfor the first time, I managed to reduce the number of scissor kicks to 6 on each side, receding and advancing.  Symmetrical.  A personal breakthrough!\n\nThis was a great way to end my 2011 summer swimming season! \n\nI only swim during the summers, when this outdoor pool is open.  I'm looking forward to picking up where I left off when next summer rolls around.\n\nChiGuy396\n\nChiGuy396@yahoo.com\n\n**", "title": "SWIMMING SIDESTROKE, AGE 60", "publishedDate": "2012-03-06T03:42:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SF6vo-VBJE", "description": "Concierto Fabulosos Cadillacs 2008\nEstadio RiverPlate. \nEspectacular", "title": "malbichofinal.AVI", "publishedDate": "2008-12-13T20:26:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SFspvzoHXk", "description": "This footage, shot in June 2009, shows some of the conditions the afghan refugees are living in at \"The Jungle\" camps in Calais, France.

In social animals, it also includes the raising of their offspring. Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. The two individuals may be of opposite sexes or hermaphroditic, as is the case with, for example, snails.\nFor animals, mating methods include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes such behaviours as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating domesticated animals and of artificially inseminating them is part of animal husbandry.\n\nIn some terrestrial arthropods, including insects representing basal (primitive) phylogenetic clades, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure. Courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as dragonflies and many spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a \"spermatophore\") into the female's reproductive tract.\nOther animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many basal vertebrates. Vertebrates (such as reptiles, some fish, and most birds) reproduce with internal fertilization through cloacal copulation (see also hemipenis), while mammals copulate vaginally.\nmating animals with other animals\nhorses mating\nbreeding horses\nmating turtles\nmating lions\nmating rabbits\nmating rhinos\nmating giraffes\nmating guinea pig\nmating dogs\nmating turtles\nmating tapirs\nmating whales\nmating bears\nmating elephants up close\nmating kangaroo\nmating gorillas\nmating season\nmating snakes\nmating humans\nmating cats\nmating cows hit by car\nmating birds\nmating pigs\nmating rituals", "title": "Brown Dog Breeding", "publishedDate": "2014-08-31T10:06:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SH6fNlPDcA", "description": "", "title": "564 Foredeck Lane Robin Phillips Real Estate Showcase TV Lifestyles", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T17:28:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SHAX4z4sLg", "description": "Loretta Lynn and the Dowhaters perform \"Portland, Oregon\" on Letterman.", "title": "Loretta Lynn Jack White \"Portland, Oregon\"", "publishedDate": "2006-06-01T00:53:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SHCS7wNAyc", "description": "Time elapsed x10", "title": "Marqueterie Masticage Motif Floral", "publishedDate": "2011-11-07T20:23:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2SHDrU6yFBg", "description": "These two handbags are having python embossment.

This was the time when donated clothes from the West reached India for the poor, but pilferage resulted in most of them being sold in roadside shops. This is how the Sunday market started\" It gradually grew and became an integral part of the city. All this came to an abrupt end a few years ago when attempting \"to reduce encroachments\" the administration decided to give the Bazaar an official sanction and shift it from Paltan Bazaar to Tibetan market road at Parade Ground.\n\nDehradun is not just a good place for sightseeing but can also be said to be every shopper's heaven. The small stores and bustling markets have plethora of priceless souvenirs that cannot be found even in the swankiest of shopping malls. All you need to have is a little patience and ability to wander along the endless roads to stock your bag with lovely memorabilia. The best shopping bazaars in Dehradun are Rajpur Road, Paltan Bazaar, Astley Hall, Connaught Place and Tibetan Market. These streets are not just filled with gift items but also stocked up with some amazing restaurants and eatery outlets that whip up yummy snacks and dishes. Don't miss out gorging on bread pakoras and samosas from Rajpur Road and also, steamed buns from Tibetan Market. The right time to visit Dehradun aka Doon Valley is between April to July when the climate is moderate and pleasant. \n\nOne of the popular place to go for shopping in Dehradun is the Tibetan market. This is the best place, especially if you want to buy colorful apparels and cool T-shirts. Both men and women visit this busy shopping center with the hope to lay their hands on some fashionable garments. The popular purchasing items here are woolen garments, exclusive Tibetan objects such as semiprecious pebbles, carpets and jewelry. Close to this place, you will find several small eateries that offer fresh Tibetan delicacies like thupkas, momos and chow\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

These ground reinforcement tiles are able to stand up to even the most heavy and regular use. Suitable for use in both domestic and commercial settings, these ground reinforcement solutions can handle weights up to and including heavy goods vehicles, while still providing suitable drainage and a strong surface that's built to last.\n\nGridforce products offer a speedy, economical and environmentally sound solution to many ground reinforcement problems. Using sustainable drainage technology we can alleviate the effects of unstable ground conditions and surface water excesses. This will help avoid the expense of installing underground tanks needed for more conventional surfaces. Our system is favoured by planning departments and provides a natural means of dealing with drainage issues in many construction situations. Proper site preparation is the key to a successful installation.\n\nSo, let's just look at a few of the uses with which we have recently been involved - car parks, lorry parks and storage areas for warehousing and production plants are good examples of the suitability of our system. The innovative, interlocking plastic tiles are made from 100% recycled material. They can provide the strength and reinforcement to areas of land that might otherwise sink or shift, but are also a cost-effective alternative to the use of traditional materials such as tarmac or other paved surfaces. Because they are interlocking, our tiles are quick and easy to install and require no upkeep. They can be used either as a permanent or temporary solution to areas where vehicles and handling equipment need to operate efficiently. Supplying our system to outdoor event organisers and land owners has proved to be one of the most successful applications of Gridforce to date. \n\nThe Gridforce ground reinforcement system would be equally suitable for agricultural shows, motor racing circuits, golf clubs and car parks as it can carry loads of up to 400 tonnes per square meter.\n\nInstalling Gridforce is very easy once the ground has been prepared. To obtain the best results, the sub-base should ideally be of suitable hardcore. A light coating of sharp sand is spread on the prepared base, before rolling it flat and laying the weed control membrane. All that's needed to cut and shape the interlocking tiles is an angle grinder - we're now ready to install the grid.

We can answer those questions for them, and provide them with the most effective vaccines available.\u201d\n Martin said that for seniors age 65 and older, Trinity Mother Frances will have high-dose formulations available. This enhances the immune protection against the flu in this vulnerable patient group. \u201cAs compared with standard dose vaccine a high dose influenza vaccine improves antibody response in patients aged 65 or older, and other groups at greater risk,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThe recent study from the New England Journal of Medicine confirms high-dose flu vaccine prevents flue better than standard dose. \u201cEfficacy of High-Dose versus Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults\u201d \u2013 New England Journal of Medicine, August 14, 2014.\nExperts agree most adults and older children should ideally get a quadrivalent flu vaccine. This form offers protection against a fourth flu strain (an additional flu strain above the traditional trivalent flu vaccine that many chain drug stores are using). For infants and toddlers age 6 months \u2013 2 years old Mother Frances Hospital carries a pediatric formulation of the quadrivalent flu vaccine. Flu-mist nasal flu vaccine is also available and is preferred in small children and those requesting a non-injection option.\n\u201cInfluenza vaccination is hugely important specially in pops at greater risk or who may be more adversely affected by the flu,\u201d said Wyley McCoy, System Pharmacy Director at Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics. \u201cWith that in mind, vaccination is hugely important, especially to populations who are at greater risk and who may be more aversely affected by the flu. With these quadrivalent flu vaccines, Mother Frances Hospital is able to provide the most effective vaccines available in the area, formulated for specific patient groups and offering patients the best chance at avoiding the flu this season.\u201d", "title": "TMFHC New Flu Vaccines - KETK", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T14:33:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ScTyoegE3Y", "description": "Full Body Workout group (coached by Mavenaction).

Just, what the fuck. Anyways, I LOVE this song. This is of course the music for the Bahamut and Ultima Weapon Battles and it just has a power that is unmatched especially for games of this generation. The song really lends itself to it's simplicity in a constant thudding bass drum and then mixes it up with some slightly different patterns on top. I thought taking a very very VERY slight djent feel to it would be fitting.\n\nI tried to only spice it up in the arrangement very little, I didn't want this one to feel as song formaty as some of my other covers just to keep the constant descending feel of the track. I tried to keep the drums simple and only do rhythms rarely exceeding an 8th note to ensure it doesn't lose the heaviness. The real issue was keeping it from being muddy. When all the instruments were tracked this cover was so sludgy, mixing took a while. Spent a little time also creating my own orchestra hits and other effects with EastWest and used them in this cover!

Rather than the usual cargo of toys, TVs and coffee, it carries other ships and oil rigs.\nWhen the US Navy needed to give their stricken destroyer USS Cole a lift home, they called on the Blue Marlin.\nAnd when the Australian Navy wanted an aircraft carrier brought from Spain, only the semi-submersible heavy lift ship would do.\nThe Blue Marlin's  dimensions are eye watering. It is 712 ft long and 138ft deep -- and has a deck the size of two football pitches.\nIt reaches a sedate top speed of 13 knots, powered by a gigantic 17,000 horse power diesel engines, with a crew of 24.\nSteering it is said to be like controlling a floating office block.\nThe barges pictured above -- which weigh a total of 60,000 tonnes - were exported from Korea to be completed in Rotterdam.\nSome were destined to be river boats, others were off shore construction vessels.\nNo crane in the world is big enough to lift these sorts of cargoes onto her deck and so she has an ingenious trick up her sleeve.\nThe deck is submersible and can disappear under 13 metres of water when her ballast tanks are pumped full of water.\nBoats, oil rigs and ships can then be floated on before the deck is raised again by emptying its ballast tank.\nIn order to carry the barges, a specially designed set of cradles was added to the Blue Marlin.

My dad bet all my savings on them.\" The screen then faded out to a message cautioning about the social fallout of gambling.\n\nBut for many Singaporeans the cautionary message fell on deaf ears as Germany romped home to a record breaking 7-1 victory over Brazil -- the worst semi-final defeat in World Cup history.\n\nThe advert aired at half-time, when Germany were already 5-0 ahead, prompting much mirth and ridicule online, including from two top government officials.\n\n\"Bad timing,\" Tan Chuan-Jin, Singapore's Minister for Manpower, wrote on his Facebook page. \"Looks like the boy's father who bet all his savings on Germany will be laughing all the way to the bank!\"\n\n\"At least the boy in the advertisement can get his savings back,\" added Teo Ser Luck, Minister of State for Trade and Industry.\n\nA meme of the commercial by local blogger Lee Kin Mun with the caption \"Always trust your father. #GER 7 : #BRA 1\" went viral on Twitter Wednesday morning.\n\nDozens of other memes related to the commercial were also circulating on social media.\n\nIn response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, an NCPG spokesperson indicated that it would not be pulling the advert, and said: \"The NCPG World Cup campaign aims to serve as a timely reminder to those who bet on soccer not to get carried away in the excitement and hype of the World Cup and let their gambling affect their loved ones.\n\n\"The focus of the TVC highlights how those close to the gambler are adversely affected by problem gambling and not who eventually wins the World Cup. Selecting Germany injected a sense of realism in our messaging, since no one will bet on a potentially losing team. At the end of the day, win or lose, the dangers of problem gambling, and the potential anxiety and pain that loved ones go through remain unchanged.\n\n\"Through this campaign, NCPG also intends to create awareness that help (24/7 helpline) is available to gamblers and their family members who are affected by problem gambling.\" The spokesperson also confirmed the advertisement would not be pulled.\n\nwww.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-anti-gambling/1249206.html", "title": "Singapore anti gambling advert falls flat after Germany win - 09Jul2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T16:20:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T26yNL-LY4", "description": "In Mumbai,  Snapshots of the cctv footage showing the nanny switching off the light and then throwing the baby onto a bean bag and then beating brutally which is really SHOCKING!!!\n\nFor more videos go to  http://www.youtube.com/gujarattv9 \nLike us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/tv9gujarati\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Tv9Gujarat\nFollow us on Pinterest at  http://www.pinterest.com/tv9gujarati/pins/", "title": "Mumbai : 11 month child brutally beaten by nanny, caught on CCTV - Tv9 Gujarati", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T14:40:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T2E5jxaLUU", "description": "220613", "title": "penstock", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T23:27:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T2qS9f_SHk", "description": "EIS Head of Physiology Dr Emma Ross explains what makes a good sports physiologist...", "title": "What makes a good physiologist?", "publishedDate": "2014-07-08T10:45:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T30ivlsyJQ", "description": "Roadtest, before the actual speedtest, Katangawan, General Santos City, Philippines", "title": "Black and Red Kawasaki Rouser 135 LS roadtest", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T01:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T32ecLlmQU", "description": "", "title": "Breaks Co-Op - Moment In Time (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T20:52:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T39JWnbu-g", "description": "Pohjoismaisen kulttuurirahaston hallituksen j\u00e4sen Risto Autio kertoo miksi suomalaisten taiteen ja kulttuurinharjoittajien kannattaa tehd\u00e4 pohjoismaisia projekteja, sek\u00e4 rahaston merkityksest\u00e4.", "title": "Risto Autio kommentoi Pohjoismaisesta Kulttuurirahastosta", "publishedDate": "2010-12-02T13:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2T3FBAVgyT4", "description": "\u266aLike Trap Nation\u2122 on FaceBook\u266a   https://www.facebook.com/AllTrapNation\nDownload Link \u2192 https://www.facebook.com/GutterBrothersLA/app_133680470170177\n\n\u266aFollow Trap Nation\u2122 on Twitter\u266a https://www.twitter.com/AllTrapNation\n\nLike the channel?

So basically it's pain, bloating, feeling full, more full than normal after a meal. All those together make up what's called indigestion.\n\nIt can be for a lot of different reasons, most likely from something you've eaten. There are times when you have a little bit more hyperacidity that can give you symptoms like that also.\n\nOther symptoms that can, kind of, go into the category of indigestion could be acid reflux as well. And again it's where you're getting a lot of hyperacidity and that can cause some pain and some bloating and management of that is basically managing the symptoms.\n\nYou can get some bloating with indigestion and that could be the most uncomfortable feeling out of all the feelings, because it's just this sensation of a big balloon that's just expanding into your stomach. That can give you the feeling of early satiety, meaning you get full quicker or you just get more full than normal with a smaller amount of food.\n\nIn severe cases, people can change their diet. They can loose weight. They can get actually quite uncomfortable with the symptoms. So it's important to identify the cause of it and help manage those symptoms.", "title": "What Is Indigestion? | Stomach Problems", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T04:07:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "2TcMwRFhB4M", "description": "A hike along Big Creek to Mouse Creek Falls, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, NC.

Local media also reported casualties in the infiltration, but there was no immediate confirmation of this.\n\nInside Gaza itself, eight children and two adults were killed by a blast in a park as an unofficial truce sought by the United Nations for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr festival collapsed.\n\nResidents blamed the explosion on an airstrike, but Israel said a misfiring militant rocket caused the carnage.\n\nHowever, Mr Netanyahu indicated in a televised speech Monday that he is widening the objectives, saying that a demilitarisation of Gaza must be part of any future solution for the territory of 1.7 million people.\n\n\"It has been a difficult, painful day,\" Mr Netanyahu said in a televised address to the nation.\n\n\"We have to have patience and be determined to continue the struggle against a murderous terror organisation, which aspires to destroy us,\" he said, adding that Israeli troops would not leave Gaza until they had destroyed Hamas's tunnel network.\n\nSome 1,060 Gazans, according to the United Nations, about three-quarters of them were civilians, have died in the conflict. Israel has lost 52 soldiers and three civilians, as well as a Thai worker. \n\nA truce between the sides remained elusive as diplomats sought to end the fighting at the start of the Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nGet the latest headlines http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nSubscribe to The Telegraph http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=telegraphtv\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/telegraph.co.uk\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/telegraph\nFollow us on Google+ https://plus.google.com/102891355072777008500/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Daily Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "title": "Israel-Gaza conflict: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu warns of 'prolonged' military operation", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T07:56:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Tm-j6mMWRw", "description": "Hopefully you guys like this new series i'm going to do with Agony :D\nComment if you'd like to see us add anything to this series or change up something :D, also, in future would you guys like to have some background music, or just the straight audio? \nAlso, in future we will record for longer periods of time, this was only recorded in a few hours :D\n\nI just realized, There is 1 more clip on Mission that agony hit so the score should've been 12-4, it somehow wasn't in the timeline when i rendered it O.O BUT MAKE SURE TO GO TO AGONYS CHANNEL TO SEE THE CLIP. \n\nFaZe Agony: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/agonyvii\nhttp://www.twitter.com/agony\n\nRemember to leave a like & favorite if you enjoyed the video!\nWant 25% discount off of Gamma?\nwww.gammalabs.net & use the code \"Kitty\" you'll get 25% off.\nMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/Kittyxhd\nMy Channel - http://www.youtube.com/Kittyxhd\nSoaR: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/soarsniping\nhttp://www.twitter.com/soargaming\n\nPrevious team:\nObeyalliance - http://www.youtube.com/Obeyalliance\nObey's Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/theobeyalliance", "title": "Clip Comp #1 Ft.

A boiler is like a teapot on a stove. When the water boils, the steam comes through a tiny hole on the top of the spout. The moving steam makes a whistle that tells you the water has boiled. In a power plant, the water is brought to a boil inside the boiler, and the steam is then piped to the turbine through very thick pipes.\"\n\nHow does a hybrid car work?\nhttp://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/vehicles/question262.htm\n\"We are all familiar with gasoline-powered cars, and most people have heard about or seen electric cars.
