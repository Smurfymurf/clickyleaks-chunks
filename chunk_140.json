On the northern course of the river in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India, live the Buddhist people of Ladakh, of Tibetan stock, and the Dards of Indo-Aryan or Dardic stock and practising Buddhism and Islam. Then it descends into Baltistan, northern Pakistan passing the main Balti city of Skardu. As it continues through Pakistan, the Indus river forms a distinctive boundary of ethnicity and cultures - upon the western banks the population is largely Pashtun, Baloch, and of other Iranic stock, with close cultural, economic and ethnic ties to eastern Afghanistan and parts of Iran. The eastern banks are largely populated by peoples of Indo-Aryan stock, such as the Punjabis and the Sindhis. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside Dardic people in the hills (Khowar, Kalash, Shina, etc.), Burushos (in Hunza), and Punjabi people.In the province of Sindh, peoples of Sindhi backgrounds form the local populations. Upon the western banks of the river live the Baloch and Pashtun peoples of Balochistan.\nSindhu Darya Day (River Indus Day) was first celebrated on 24 January 2010 in Sindh in tribute to the River Indus. The Government of Sindh has decided to celebrate this day every year.\nPeople from Tharparkar belonging to the Bheel, Kohli and Thakur communities also offered prayers according to their traditions and danced to the tune of national and Sindhi songs.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization", "title": "DARIYA BAADSHAH - Sapta Sindhu -24-1-2010.", "publishedDate": "2011-08-28T17:59:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pHvg5uHtF8", "description": "This video has been uploaded for instructional purposes only.

The Gairsoppa became U.K. property after the government paid the owners of the ship an insurance sum of \u00a3325,000 in 1941. Records indicate the silver was valued at \u00a3600,000 in 1941.\n\nThe initial recovery of 48 tons consists of 1,203 silver bars and has been transported to a secure facility in the United Kingdom, according to the company.\n\n\"With the shipwreck lying approximately three miles below the surface of the North Atlantic, this was a complex operation,\" Odyssey CEO Greg Stemm said in Odyssey's release.\n\nOdyssey contracted JBR Recovery Ltd., a European silver recovery and precious metal processing company, to assist in refining and monetizing the recovered silver.", "title": "48 Tons of Silver Recovered From World War II Shipwreck", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T09:28:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pPKdtoexBQ", "description": "[Dream-Pop] MORindie - Discover MOR music.\n\u25baSubscribe for MOR!: http://bit.ly/18KPseO\n\u25baFacebook: http://facebook.com/MORindie\n\n\u25baDownload: http://bit.ly/16juOBX\n\n\u25baFollow Light The Air:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/lighttheair\nhttp://twitter.com/lighttheair\nhttp://soundcloud.com/lighttheair\n\n\u25baPicture (Go To School \u00a9 Dr. Green):\nhttp://500px.com/photo/14586755\nhttp://500px.com/Kittikun\n\n\u25baFollow MOR: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/MORNetwork\nhttps://twitter.com/MORNetwork\n\n//LYRICS//\nTake me home where the water's warm\nand the skies are never grey\nOn this battlefield where the lines are drawn\nthe path is never straight\n\nThe trumpets call in the neon dawn for our bodies to awake\nLove of mine would you be so kind and shelter me the same\nRunning from the fall we're hesitant draw cause we gambled all the way\nSo we howl at the moon with particular plume to insist our hearts will stay\n\nTake me home where the signs are off\nand the nights fade into black\nI'll pretend your mine as you drive me home \ncause I'm never looking back\n\nThe trumpets call in the neon dawn for our bodies to awake\nLove of mine would you be so kind and shelter me the same\nRunning from the fall we're hesitant draw cause we gambled all the way\nSo we howl at the moon with particular plume to insist our hearts will stay\n\nWe howl at the moon...", "title": "Light The Air - Plume", "publishedDate": "2013-03-20T19:21:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pPjZ7ew0Q8", "description": "My supplements: http://alongabbay.com/best-bodybuilding-supplements\nMy facebook: http://facebook.com/ALONSIXPACK\nIf you have questions please leave them in the comments below.\n\nSupplements names from this review:\n\nUniversal Nutrition Animal Pak Multivitamin\nVitamin C\nMagnesium / Magnezium\nNOW - Green Tea Extract\nOptimum Nutrition 100% Gold Standard Whey Protein\nOptimum Nutrition Gold Standard Casein Protein\n\n\nKeep working out hard and stay dedicated.\n\nAlon Gabbay", "title": "Best Bodybuilding Supplements - My Supplement Stack", "publishedDate": "2013-01-17T00:28:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pPpatlB774", "description": "Maneuvering using camouflage and small unit tactics", "title": "Optio Tacitus Small Unit Tactics", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T16:38:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pQ0DqBe-Gc", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "SPB Shankill Protestant Boys The Sash on the Twelfth 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-07-13T11:08:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7pQFEr8AC04", "description": "Ms. Cameron AP Bio 2014.                               \nWorks cited page for Golgi apparatus\nhyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/golgi.html\nwww.nature.com/.../how-do-proteins-move-through-the-golgi-14397318\nmicro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/golgi/golgiapparatus.html\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \u203a NCBI \u203a Literature \u203a Bookshelf.

You want to clean your tank once a week, every two weeks, once a month, depending on how dirty it is, how many fish, and how much you feed. Every tank is going to be a little bit different, but the cleaning methods are pretty much the same. The goal of cleaning an aquarium is to get a lot of the waste out of the water with minimal shock to the environment. Remember, there is bacteria that's growing in the filter, on the sand bed, and even on the glass and decorations in the aquarium. You want to minimize the shock to this bacteria because this bacteria is what's responsible for keeping your water safe for your fish. It's constantly growing and breaking down waste. It's breaking down ammonia and nitrite and keeping that water really, really clean and safe for the fish.\n\nWhen we go in there, we clean it and we change half the water and our filter, we're shocking the system. We could almost do more harm than good by cleaning our fish tanks. The key is really to do regular maintenance, not to wait until the tank gets really, really dirty, the filtration stops working, and the water is really cloudy. That's when you're going to be setting yourself up for a disaster after you clean the tank. I've seen many people when they clean their aquarium, the water is cloudy for a week or two after that because the bacteria is so shocked.\n\nTo clean your aquarium, you want to do regular water changes. I recommend 15 to 20 percent every two to four weeks, again, depending on the stocking density of your aquarium. You want to invest in a good gravel cleaner, a siphon, a bucket, a good algae pad, and some test kits and dechlorinators. You want to change the water. As you're taking 15 to 20% of the water out, you want to go through the sand bed or the gravel bed very, very slowly and remove a lot of the waste that has been settled in that gravel. You'd be amazed at what gets trapped in the gravel. It's really, in my opinion, your best filter, your gravel bed.\n\nYou want to free that up, get a lot of the waste out. Flush it down the toilet. Make sure you don't dump any gravel down the toilet or you're going to have to call a plumber. When you put new water back in the aquarium, you want to make sure the pH and the temperature is stable. It's good to let water sit overnight so it has a change to degas. A pH test kit and some pH up, pH down, whether in liquid or in dry powder form will be beneficial to help getting the pH back to where it is. You want to match the pH to what it was in the aquarium. The main thing is to not shock your aquarium.\n\nIf you haven't done a water change in a while, make sure your pH of the new water matches your existing water. What that means is your pH could be as low as 6.5 even though it's supposed to be at 7.0. The new water is probably going to be 7.4 to 7.6. You'll shock the aquarium by putting high pH water, so you want to bring the pH down in the new water before adding it.\n\nAs far as your filtration, you want to clean the filtration in a manner that's not going to shock the bacteria, cleaning the filters in water from the aquarium in a bucket. Even in the dirty water, you can squeeze out your filtration and then put it back in. Replace the carbon, that's going to keep the water free from getting a lot of organics and yellow. Again, don't shock it and do it regularly.

After you use them you can feel the difference, knowing that it's actually free of sulfates, and preservatives. The smell is very light and subtle. An important fact to consider: did you know that several big and well known companies have formaldehyde in their ingredients list? And it's often at higher rates than the ones recommended by the FDA, especially on kids products. A quick research on formaldehyde brings you to the National Cancer Instutute showing that research studies of workers exposed to formaldehyde have suggested an association between formaldehyde exposure and several cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia. Here's the study that shows you the potential dangers of this chemical: http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/formaldehyde Is this really something you want around your bathroom and around your kids? Don't think so darling!\n\nNow onto the fun stuff: one of Beecology's founders, David Rzepka, tells the story of how it all started:\n\"About six years ago I agreed to let a co-worker put a beehive on my family farm. I didn't plan to be responsible for it, but when life events kept him from tending to it, I became a beekeeper. I found bee science and culture fascinating, and I soon began researching bees and attending workshops at The Ohio State University agricultural campus. Beyond enjoying the science, I found that tending the bees gave me time to reflect. I also came to realize how connected the bees' world is to ours - any changes in our environment affect their environment as well. I began to think about the foods we eat, the chemicals we use, and the impact these factors have on bees and on us. That's when the idea hit me: I wanted to make natural skincare and hair products using honey, beeswax, and other ingredients that are good for us and our world.\n\nThis is the philosophy behind Beecology. Today my family and I produce a full line of natural products - lip balm, soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion - that help our customers keep their skin and hair healthy the natural way.\"\n\nLastly, in addition to drawing from the world to make our natural skincare and hair products, they give back through their own charitable arm, SweetYear.org. How could you not love them?\n\nBut...why is this so important? You might not know that bees are dying off worldwide and they're such an important element to our environment, bees are responsible for 90% of the pollinating of the plants we grow.\n\nA campaign by Avaaz explains the issue in more details:\nDid you know that bees are dying off worldwide and our entire food chain is in peril? Scientists blame toxic pesticides and four European governments have already banned them. Bees are vital to life on earth \u2014 every year pollinating plants and crops with an estimated $40bn value, over one third of the food supply in many countries. Without immediate action to save bees many of our favourite fruits, vegetables, and nuts could vanish from our shelves.\n\nAnd then what will we do? Grow more GMO's and make matters even worse? We hope not.\n\nSign the petition here: https://secure.avaaz.org/en/save_the_bees/\n\nAnd make sure to support great companies that are helping not only make a safe product but are also helping such a fragile insect that has such a huge impact in our life.

Instantly learn how to increase your internet speed and experience an increase in your computer speed.  This will almost instantly give you faster internet speed on all your computers as you browse and surf the internet. It's simple, easy & free. See how to speed up your browser internet connection without spending money. So go ahead and see how to increase your internet speed for free. This works seamlessly in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8\nhttp://youtu.be/7pb3aMx6gpQ\n\nhttp://www.nickscomputerfix.com\nhttp://www.coolestcheaplaptops.com\n\nSo what is DNS server service anyway? It basically converts ip address numbers into understandable word addresses; like www.nickscomputerfix.com or www.google.com. Whenever you type an address in your browsers address bar, the computer doesn't know where nickscomputerfix.com or google.com points to and it will therefore ask the DNS server to convert and translate. Give directions in english so to speak and therefore it will then know where to take you when you make an internet domain site request.\n\nOpen DNS servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites requests in their cache so it takes less time to resolve your requests. Unlike the DNS servers automatically provided by your less reliable ISP, you will get a reply 9 times out of 10 instantly faster.\n\nAlso Google Chrome is a faster internet browser for surfing the web. Here's the download link for Google Chrome:\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/\n\nDo you want some other ways to increase your Internet speed.

We've mentioned how great it can be in soups and stews, but if you have a few left over, they make a great broth. When you're done, you'll have a perfect base for soup, for pasta or risotto, braising meats, and more.P\n\n\nSave the Rind from Good Parmesan Cheese for a Flavor Boost in Soups and a Soft, Spreadable Side\nA good wedge or block of Parmesan can be pricey, but there's no substituting it when it comes...\nRead more\nOur friends over at Food 52 pointed this one out to us. Their recipe is specifically for a parmesan broth, that uses two or three rinds from a nice wedge of parm, but they also note that you shouldn't hesitate to use the end bits from other kinds of cheeses too. Whatever you like works, although preferably firmer cheeses are in order, so cheddar, pecorino, asiago, and dry jack all work well.P\n\nThey explain that those firm cheese rinds pack a ton of flavor that you don't want to just throw away:P\n\nBut those rinds have a huge amount of flavor tucked inside their hard, nubbly skin, and deserve to be at the forefront of your soups, your stews \u2014 and your stock. If you're treating yourself to the good stuff \u2014 and you should be \u2014 turning your Parmesan rinds into a rich, cheesy broth is the best way to get the most bang out of your aged, funky, Italian buck.P\nAll you need is about a cup of cheese rinds. Make sure they're clean and rinsed off, then toss them into a pot. Cover them with about eight cups of water, and bring it to a boil. Simmer for an hour or two, and you're done\u2014cook longer to get the level of rich flavor you really want. They even note you can toss in some broth-friendly veggies too if you like, but you don't have to. When you're done, let it cool and store it in the fridge for a few weeks, or the freezer for a few months. You can use your new cheese broth in place of chicken or vegetable broth just about anywhere, like in a soup recipe, when you're making risotto or rice, in a pot of beans, to deglaze a pan, and more.P\n\nHit the link below for more photos, and a few additional suggestions for where you can use your new trash-to-treasure broth.P\n\nJoin #FOWLERNATION!! http://bit.ly/SubscribeFowlerNation\nBecome a Patron! http://Patreon.com/FowlerShow\n\n3 Steps To Join #FowlerNation!\n1.

Einzelne Dateien Downloadlink [OFFLINE] [DELETED]\n3. Einzelne Ordner Downloadlink\n4. Wege das Spiel zu reparieren\n\n1. Probleme mit der gta3.img? Oder blo\u00df mit einer Datei?\n\ngta3.img Download: http://modbase.pl/download/backupy-kopie-zapasowe-plikow/backupy-gta-sa/backup-gta3-img\n\nErkl\u00e4rung wie man die Datei runterl\u00e4dt: Du solltest einen roten Text namens \"Downloads\" finden. Dort klickst du einfach drauf. Danach klickst du etwas weiter unten nochmal auf download und das gleiche nochmal. Dann l\u00e4dst du automatisch eine neue gta3.img runter!\n\n3. Einzelne Ordner: http://ffsgaming.net/archive/index.php/t-4179.html\n\n4. Wege das Spiel zu reparieren:\n\nEs gibt einige Wege wie man das Spiel reparieren bzw. zur\u00fccksetzen kann wenn man leider vergessen hat ein Backup zu machen. Hier habe ich einige aufgelistet die ich selber auch empfehlen kann.\n\n-1. Das Spiel neuinstallieren. \nEs dauert nicht lang und ist am sichersten. Nachteil ist leider das dann alle Mods verschwunden sind. (Ausnahme: San Andreas Mod Installier auf Windows Vista/ Seven , siehe unten)\n\n-2 San Andreas Mod Installer\nDer SAMI erstellt eigene Backups. Einmal die ganze gta3.img und einmal einzelne Dateien. (Z.b. Sabre.dff & .txd) Um die modifizierte gta3.img zu finden m\u00fcsst ihr auf Appdata/Local/VirtualStore/Rockstar Games/San Andreas gehen und dort im Ordner Models die Datei finden. Die SAMI Backups der dff und txd Dateien findet ihr auch in der Appdata. Da m\u00fcsst ihr nach dem San Andreas Mod Installer suchen.\n\n-3 GTA San Andreas - Recoverer (Download unten)\nEs erlaubt euch nur bestimmte Dateien aus eurer GTA SA CD neu zu installieren. Wollt ihr also nur die gta3.img neuinstallieren aber wollt nicht das die anderen Dateien neuinstalliert werden? Dann holt euch das Programm. Voraussetzung ist nat\u00fcrlich das man die CD besitzt bzw. eine Image davon. \nDownload: http://www.gtainside.com/download.php?do=comments&cat=249&start=7&id=22764&orderBy=\n\n-4 MACHT EIN BACKUP\nH\u00f6rt man viel zu oft und man h\u00f6rt nicht drauf. (Kenn ich leider nur zu gut) Wenn dann aber das Spiel schrott ist bereut man es meistens und muss das Spiel neuinstallieren oder nach Videos wie dieses suchen. Macht euch daher Backups oder benutzt SAMI, testet jeden Mod einzeln! (Mod installieren, testen, n\u00e4chsten Mod installieren, testen, etc.) und \u00fcbertreibt es nicht mit den Mods. \n\n______________________________________\n\n(2) English:\n\nMy English is not pretty awesome. But I hope you can read anything.\n\n1. gta3.img Downloadlink\n2. single files Downloadlink [OFFLINE][DELETED]\n3. single folders Downloadlink\n4. Ways to repair your game\n\n1. Problems with gta3.img? Or just a file?\n\ngta3.img Download: http://modbase.pl/download/backupy-kopie-zapasowe-plikow/backupy-gta-sa/backup-gta3-img (click on download (it's red) then again aaaaaand again.)\n\n3. single folders: http://ffsgaming.net/archive/index.php/t-4179.html\n\n4. Ways to repair your game\n\n-1 Reinstall your game\nThe fastest and safest way. Just reinstall your game. The bad part is that all your mods will be gone after that. (Except the San Andreas Mod Installer in Windows Vista/Seven, read below)\n\n-2 San Andreas Mod Installer\nThe SAMI makes its own backups! There are 2 kinds of backups. First, the whole gta3.img. You can find the modded one in Appdata/Local/VirtualStore/Rockstar Games/San Andreas/models . Just delete it and your game should be mod free. Second kind are backups of files like sabre.dff & txd. You can find them in the Appdata. Just search for the SAMI in there.\n\n-3 GTA San Andreas - Recoverer (Downloadlink below)\nIt's fast and safe. What do you want more? A simple program that allows you to install only the files you need to reinstall. The only thing you need is the GTA SA CD or an Image of it. \nDownload: http://www.gtainside.com/download.php?do=comments&cat=249&start=7&id=22764&orderBy=\n\n-4 MAKE A BACKUP\nI know that you all heard that too often. But it's probably the best, fastest and safest way if you need to reinstall something. It's a pretty shitty situation if you don't have a backup and your game won't start/load. So please make backups (or use the SAMI for vehicles), TEST the mod before you install another one and don't install too many mods.\n\n\nPS: I want nothing for this video, but a simple \"thank you\" would be great! :)\n\nCheers.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n(3) Single gta3.img files:\n\nNeed a backup file from the gta3.img?

It has characteristic loud alarm calls which are variously rendered as did he do it or pity to do it leading to colloquial names like the did-he-do-it bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter).\n\nRed-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\n\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black\n\nMales and females are similar in plumage but males have a 5% longer wing and tend to have a longer carpal spur. The length of the birds is 320-350mm, wing of 208-247mm with the nominate averaging 223mm, Sri Lanka 217mm. The Bill is 31-36mm and tarsus of 70-83mm. Tail length is 104-128mm.\n\nIt usually keeps in pairs or trios in well-watered open country, ploughed fields, grazing land, and margins and dry beds of tanks and puddles. They occasionally form large flocks, ranging from 26 to 200 birds. It is also found in forest clearings around rain-filled depressions. It runs about in short spurts and dips forward obliquely (with unflexed legs) to pick up food in a typical plover manner. They are said to feed at night being especially active around the full moon. Is uncannily and ceaselessly vigilant, day or night, and is the first to detect intrusions and raise an alarm, and was therefore considered a nuisance by hunters. Flight rather slow, with deliberate flaps, but capable of remarkable agility when defending nest or being hunted by a hawk.\n\nIts striking appearance is supplemented by its noisy nature, with a loud and scolding did-he-do-it call, often uttered at night.\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Join us at the reception for the 12 contemporary abstract artists on Saturday, January 22nd, 2011. These artists include: Anne Bouie, Daniel T. Brooking, Desepe de Vargas, Elsa Gebreyesus, Carolyn Goodridge, Hubert Jackson, Wayson Jones, Viola Leak, Eugene Vango, Kathleen Varnell, J. Bertram White, and Ann Marie Williams.\n\nWalk and Talk with the artists is led by the curator, Jarvis DuBois on Saturday, January 22, 2011 from 3:30-5pm. Afterwards, the reception includes a special musical guest, Bertell Knox and Generations, from 5-7 pm. Closing reception: Saturday, March 12, 2011 at 3-5 pm. The works in the exhibition illustrate various mediums and methods including digital archival prints, encaustic, silk shibori and smoke-fired stoneware. The art gallery of Arts/Harmony Hall Regional Center is an impressive art space, with over 180 feet of total carpeted wall space. The entire exhibit runs from January 17 -- March 12, 2011, with Black History Month smack dab in the middle of the show's duration.\n\nMost of the artists featured in Black Abstraction speak of an energy and spirituality that guides their practice as expressed through: the five senses (Brooking), musical forms such as the blues, jazz and R&B (de Vargas and Williams), nature and the changing light patterns of the weather and seasons (Goodridge, Jackson, and White), multi-layering and various textural media, such as sand (Gebreyesus, Jones, and Leak), early African craft and folk art traditions (Bouie and Varnell), while others have been influenced by other art styles and movements, including Abstract Expressionism and the Colorists (Vango).\n\nFor many black artists, abstraction serves as an alternative way to express political and social ideas, fears, dreams and longings outside of figuration. A few notable African American artists who have made seminal contributions to abstract art and Abstract Expressionism idioms include DC-based artist Sam Gilliam, Norman Lewis, Alma Thomas, Felrath Hin\u00e8s, Al Loving, Moe Brooker, Stephanie Pogue and Charles Searles.\n\nIn his essay \"Blindness, Abstraction and 'Double Consciousness': the Critical Imaginary and the Sources of Modern Art,\" CUNY professor and author Dr. Geoffrey Jacques summed up the relationship between African-American visual culture and abstract art as: \"abstraction entered modern (so-called Western) culture in large part as an African or black thing, and is in fact, a 'black' tradition.\" Increasing the understanding of this often misunderstood aesthetic and exposure of these art-markers is the primary focus of this current exhibition.\n\nThe purpose of \"Black Artists of DC\" (BADC) is to create a Black artists community to promote, develop and validate the culture, artistic expressions and aspirations of past and present artists of Black-Afrikan ancestry in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Some of the goals of BADC are to \" produce, exhibit, document, continue and conserve our artistic legacy; create a cooperative trans-generational training ground for artists; create an advocacy for Black artists through community and political activity; and create and support a market for the art created by people of African descent.", "title": "Black Abstraction Artist Talk -

This Dubloon hack takes advantage of a defect in the memory settings of Puzzle Pirates to trick the game into thinking you have a lot more PoE than actually earned.

Unfortunately for the Bennets, if Mr Bennet dies their house will be inherited by a distant cousin whom they have never met, so the family's future happiness and security is dependent on the daughters making good marriages. Life is uneventful until the arrival in the neighbourhood of the rich gentleman Mr Bingley, who rents a large house so he can spend the summer in the country.

It's construction is steel, with motorized elements that let you control the recline angle, sound (Bose integrated speakers), power hub (USB etc.) and the coolest part is the adjustable monitor arm. You can literally game at at the angle you feel most comfortable at and feel totally immersed. The video shows the model with a triple monitor setup. It's both Mac and PC compatible so you're safe if you're in either court.

Whether you're a professional chef or a home cook, having a set of good kitchen knives is a must. In this video, Chris Cosentino, Chef and Co-owner of Incanto Restaurant, introduces the Shun Fuji knives. \n\nShun Fuji knives offer advanced materials, elegant appearance and exceptional performance. Each blade is made of SG2 steel and clad with 160 layers of forged nickel stainless Damascus steel. The knife features a beautiful textured grip made of extremely dense wood and a Damascus cap that protects the blade of the knife as well as the handle. Accurate and lightweight, this knife is very good for edge handling.\n\nChris demonstrates the use of these sharp Eastern style kitchen knives by preparing a squash blossom risotto. He starts chopping two large onions and transfers them into a large bowl. The wide blade allows you to transfer cut vegetables easily into a bowl, without using too many kitchen tools. He uses the same knife to cut other veggies for the squash blossom risotto. These durable Shun Fuji knives offer consistency and longevity so you don't have to worry about sharpening your knives regularly. \n\nUse these high-performance knives used by Japanese chefs for razor sharpness and ultimate control.\n\nTo explore further, visit: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/\n\nCheck out the Shun Fuji line here: \nhttp://www.williams-sonoma.com/shop/cutlery/knives-shun\n\nA full selection of Shun cutlery is offered at Williams-Sonoma:http://www.williams-sonoma.com/shop/cutlery/knives-shun/\n\nChris Cosentino's Cookbook can also be purchased at Williams-Sonoma: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/chris-cosentino-beginnings-cookbook/", "title": "Enhance Your Cooking with Shun Fuji Knives | Williams-Sonoma", "publishedDate": "2011-12-12T23:13:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qGMismvYRU", "description": "Leaving port in very rough weather.

Days are getting shorter, nights are getting longer. The smell of burning leaves and car tires fills the air and Third Man proudly preps its final Vault package for the 2013 calendar.\n\nThe LP this coming quarter is a stunning live recording of the Raconteurs live at the Ryman Auditorium. Recorded from their most recent spell of shows in September 2011, the set is chock-full of all the unforgettable original tunes (no covers!) that make this band so essential. Of particular import are the barnstorming, bring-the-house down versions of \"Blue Veins\" and \"Carolina Drama\" both clocking in at over ten minutes in length. You like horn sections? Then dig the crack team on \"The Switch and the Spur\" and \"Many Shades of Black.\" The band captured here hits the mark at full-throttle. Pressed on two LPs of 180-gram vinyl goodness, disc one on a rich rawhide and tobacco colored vinyl and disc two on luscious gold and oil colored vinyl. \n\nThe 7\" this go-round is incredibly special. Two BRAND NEW studio recordings from the Dead Weather. \"Open Up (That's Enough)\" and \"Rough Detective\" are unlike anything else the band has ever done and are both ample reminders of the ferocity of this motley collection of low-lifes, grifters and ne'er-do-wells. These songs are not throw-aways. These songs are not demos. These songs are not outtakes. This 7\" will ONLY be available via Vault subscription. No other 7\" of these songs will be made. The whole thing is pressed on striking yellow jacket vinyl and coupled with a custom glue-pocket picture sleeve, a slight shift from the Vault's usual die-cut company sleeves. \n\nIs there more to come from this? Yes there is. The Dead Weather's plan is to record and release two-song sets until 2015 at which time they will release a full album that contains these singles plus many more album-only tracks. It's a unique long-term plan for new music from this incendiary group. The songs WILL be released digitally, but not until Vault packages have been dispatched to subscribers. The goal is that physical copies are out there first.\n\nOur bonus item here is a companion DVD of the Raconteurs performance from the Ryman Auditorium. The four camera, high-definition shoot includes the venue (the venerable Ryman, where everyone from Hank Williams to Harry Houdini has performed) as an essential character. There's a reason why folks call the Ryman \"the mother church\" and we think this film illustrates the reasoning behind that precisely and pricelessly. To not only hear, but see the Raconteurs at their arguable zenith is a treat unparalleled.\n\nSubscriptions are open now through October 31st only at http://thirdmanstore.com/vault\n\nThe Raconteurs Live at the Ryman Auditorium September 15, 2011 LP/DVD track list:\n\n1.

When it is extremely young, it has a pinkish color and its tentacles are long and dark maroon. At the adult stage the dark maroon color of the tentacles starts to fade and the purple appears as stripes on the bell. At a young age the adults' four frilly oral arms will become longer. When the jellyfish starts to get older the tentacles thicken and the purple stripes start to darken and the tentacles start to look pale, its oral arms like to disappear. They are known to feed on a variety of organisms including Cladocera, Appendicularia, Copepoda, Hydromedusae, Siphonophpra, and fish eggs. When the prey touches a marginal tentacle of the jelly, stingers are immediately discharged to paralyze prey and marginal tentacle bends inward to the nearest oral arm. The oral arm is used to transport prey to the gastrovascular cavity (GVC) and to catch motionless prey. The sting of this jellyfish is extremely painful to humans but is rarely if ever fatal.", "title": "Purple Striped Jellyfish washing ashore in Newport Beach, CA 7/1/2012", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T09:39:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qP6pmJdQZ0", "description": "Enjoy these hilarious outtakes from John Petrucci and James LaBrie!\n\nVisit http://www.DreamTheater.net for tour dates and tickets.\n\nRoadrunner Records has announced the eagerly anticipated new album from the legendary Dream Theater. \"DREAM THEATER\" -- the first self-titled collection in the GRAMMY\u00ae-nominated band's nearly three decade career -- arrives at last on September 24th.\n\n\"DREAM THEATER\" was recorded at Cove City Sound Studios in Glen Cove, New York, with founding guitarist John Petrucci producing and studio luminary Richard Chycki (Aerosmith, Rush) engineering and mixing. The album marks a brilliant new chapter for the always adventurous band, their first to have been written and recorded with drummer Mike Mangini wholly integrated into the creative process from the start.\n\n\"I see every new album as an opportunity to start over,\" says Petrucci. \"To either build or improve upon a direction that has been evolving over time or to completely break new ground. This is the first self-titled album of our career and there is nothing I can think of that makes a statement of musical and creative identity stronger than that. We've fully explored all of the elements that make us unique, from the epic and intense to the atmospheric and cinematic. We're incredibly excited about 'DREAM THEATER' and can't wait for everyone to hear it.\"\n\n\"DREAM THEATER\" will be available in a wide range of distinctive versions, including standard and special edition CDs, 180 Gram Vinyl Double LP, and a Limited Edition Box Set. Pre-orders are scheduled to get underway sometime in July at the Roadrunner Records Webstore. \n\n\"DREAM THEATER\" follows 2011's acclaimed \"A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS.\" That album -- highlighted by \"On The Backs Of Angels,\" which earned the iconic band its first ever GRAMMY\u00ae Award nomination (in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category) -- proved one of Dream Theater's most successful, making top 10 chart debuts in 14 countries, including our own Billboard 200. \"A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS\" was hailed for its ambition, complexity, and sheer melodic power, with Japan's influential BURRN! naming it as the year's \"Best Album.\"  \n\nFurthermore, the special edition CD/DVD set of \"A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS\" included \"The Spirit Carries On\" -- a 60-minute movie documenting Dream Theater's drummer auditions, which resulted in the addition of the gifted Mangini. The challenge spurred Dream Theater to extraordinary artistic heights on \"A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS\" and the epic world tour that followed. Long known as one of hard rock's most powerful live acts, the recalibrated band hit the road hard in celebration of the acclaimed album, a 15-month trek which saw sold out headline shows in 35 countries across North America, Europe, Asia, Central America, and South America.\n\nWith total sales exceeding 10 million albums and DVDs worldwide, Dream Theater have long stood among the upper echelon of hard rock giants. Albums such as 1992's RIAA gold-certified classic \"IMAGES & WORDS\" (featuring the breakthrough top 10 single, \"Pull Me Under\") have earned the Long Island-based band countless accolades for their visionary synthesis of melodic power and virtuosic experimentation, including being named as one of Rolling Stone's top 10 \"Best Prog Rock Bands of All time.\"\n\nSince uniting with Roadrunner in 2007, Dream Theater has unleashed a series of remarkable albums, each work revealing stunning new musical facets and creative avenues. 2009's \"BLACK CLOUDS & SILVER LININGS\" proved a milestone, debuting at #6 on the Billboard 200 -- the band's highest album chart debut to date. \n\nDream Theater will tour in support of \"DREAM THEATER\" -- full details will be announced soon.

To put it simply, this principle states that in order for you to gain more and more muscle over time, you need to:\n\nA) Train with a high enough level of intensity in order to \"overload\" your muscles and stimulate new growth. (I recommend taking each set at least 1-2 reps short of concentric muscular failure in order to achieve this)\n\nB) Progressively increase the resistance over time on your exercises by adding more weight on a consistent basis from week to week.\n\nIs progressive overload necessary when it comes to building muscle?\n\nNot only is overload and progression necessary, but it lies at the very foundation of your entire bodybuilding workout plan. If you aren't getting stronger on all of your exercises over time, you can be sure that you won't be getting bigger either.\n\nIf you were squatting 200 pounds today, and were still squatting 200 pounds 3 months from now, do you think your legs would have gotten any bigger in that time? Of course not. It's only when you increase to 205... 210... 225.... 250 and beyond that your muscles will grow to greater and greater levels.\n\nIf you haven't been focusing on the progressive overload principle up until now, it's time to get started. Get a workout logbook, start tracking your sessions in detail, strive for continual improvement, and you'll be shocked at the rapid muscle building difference it makes.\n\n\n** Get Your Free 28-Day Fast Mass Building Plan:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com/28-Day-Mass-Plan\n\n** Connect With Me On Facebook:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.Facebook.com/SeanNalewanyjOfficial\n\n** Follow All Of My Latest Articles, Tips & Recommendations:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com", "title": "Progressive Overload: The Key To Muscle Growth", "publishedDate": "2012-12-10T12:13:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qPbs9XablI", "description": "", "title": "Goof Troop Christmas Special part3of3", "publishedDate": "2009-03-03T17:45:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qQ38eHJdx8", "description": "Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built the first steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Chinese Emperor. It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "New 2014 Volvo XC70 clip", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:04:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qQ6Tb9CVK8", "description": "Alkaline - Anywhere We Go \u00a9 2014 \nProduced by ZJ Chrome & Russian\n\nPin: 73FEBAE2 | Akam Entertainment Social Media:  \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/akam_ent\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/akam_ent\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/akam.ent\n\nHype Life Magazine - Exploring the most dynamic range of music, videos, celebrity news, fashion, beauty, lifestyle and artworks concerning Jamaica to California.\nVisit: http://hypelifemagazine.com\n\nAlkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014\nAlkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014\nAlkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014\nAlkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014\nAlkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014", "title": "Alkaline - Anywhere We Go (Full Song) November 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T13:12:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qQCNOXnscg", "description": "Gripset Betta Reinforcing Fabric is lightweight and designed to be embedded between coats of Gripset Betta membranes to provide protective reinforcement and increase the durability of the finished membrane coating.

There is no matter.\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein\n\nTesla said it. Einstein Agreed. Science proved it. It is a known fact that everything\u2014including our own bodies\u2014is made up of energy vibrating at different frequencies. That being said, can sound frequencies affect us? They sure can. Frequencies affect frequencies; much like mixing ingredients with other ingredients affects the overall flavor of a meal. The way frequencies affect the physical world has been demonstrated through various experiments such as the science of Cymatics and water memory.\n\nThe science of Cymatics illustrates that when sound frequencies move through a particular medium such as water, air or sand, it directly alters the vibration of matter. Below are pictures demonstrating how particles adjust to different frequencies. \n\nhttp://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/12/21/heres-why-you-should-convert-your-music-to-432hz/", "title": "Secrets of Vibration!

How do you write a scholarship essay? What should you include in a scholarship essay?  How do you start a scholarship essay? What should you write about in a scholarship essay? What is a winning scholarship essay? \n\n\u2022   Join a FREE Path to Scholarships\u00ae college and scholarship e-Course on the \n    www.edudaris.com by clicking on the left navigation bar COURSES. \n\n\u2022   Select the Scholarship Essay Builder with Pre-writes or Scholarship Essay Pre-writes \n    and Forms assignment.\n\n\u2022   Use the scholarship essay writing forms to plan, organize, and complete your winning \n    scholarship essay\n\nYou want me to write? No Way!! The essay is critical to your application but it is no longer than one page... You can do it!\n\nThis is often the most difficult part of the scholarship process. This might be the number one reason why you will never complete a scholarship application successfully; you simply cannot complete the essay! It is the most important part of your scholarship application because it is your best chance to reflect who you are to a scholarship committee. Write a basic essay that answers the major questions that most scholar- ships are asking. \n\nThen modify your essay to fit the requirements for each individual scholarship without having to write a new essay each time. This allows you to use the same essay over and over again in applying for many scholarships.\n\nYOU WANT ME TO WRITE? NO WAY!!\n     \nThe next step in the Path of Organization is one of the most difficult and the most crucial in the application process. The student essay is required nearly 100% of the time for the scholarship application. It is one of the major reasons why students never complete a scholarship application successfully!\n     \nThe student will do the research and have many applications to complete, but the process many times will end here. The reason is because it is very difficult for a student to begin to put on paper what a scholarship committee really needs to know in order to differentiate the student from other scholarship applicants. Time is another factor for high school seniors whose heads are in the clouds and the activities and events just do not seem to stop.\n\nHOW DO I WRITE A WINNING SCHOLARSHIP ESSAY?\n\nTo complete a winning scholarship essay follow these easy steps: Pre-write, First Draft, Revise, Edit, and Re-write. Do not skip any of the steps! Use the forms and sample essays in this workbook as a guide to successful writing. Never start the essay with, \"Hello, my name is _________________.\"\n\nDO NOT BE AFRAID to be personal in the essay. Being personal does not necessarily mean writing an emotional tear-jerking essay. Students should write about what is personally meaningful, no matter how insignificant it may seem.\n\nINCLUDE ADJECTIVES that describe color, the five senses, and meaning with specific details and descriptions of family members, educational backgrounds, work history, community service, times, dates, locations, and names. These steps complete the preparation or foundation for writing the winning scholarship essay.\n\nWHAT CATCHES THE INTEREST OF THE SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE?\n\nThe scholarship selection committee must read the essay and see a difference. It must stand out among many, many essays! It can tell a story of a truly deserving young person who wants to do something no one in his family has ever done before, and without that scholarship his dreams will never come true.\n\nAnother powerful essay could be about a student who has dedicated many hours making a difference serving others in community service, has excelled academically or who has demonstrated leadership. Scholarship committees want to select students who have taken leadership roles in their community, school, sports, clubs, church, government, and civic organizations.\n\nA winning scholarship essay is the student's story. The essay must have color, details, be personal, tell of actual experiences or stories, be well written, and free from grammatical errors. The final draft should only be one typed double-spaced page. Scholarship committees have many applications from students who have similar GPA's, test scores and awards, and often the essay becomes the deciding factor!\n\nEdudaris.com has a FREE college and scholarship e-Course, Path to Scholarships\u00ae which is a college and scholarship planning guide that empowers students with checklists, planning forms, and organizational tools that assist students to reach their dream of college and the money to pay for the dream.

Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a \"sense of humour.\"\nThe term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which stated that a mix of fluids known as humours (Greek: \u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, chymos, literally juice or sap; metaphorically, flavour) controlled human health and emotion. (This theory has since been found to be counterfactual.)[citation needed]\nA sense of humour is the ability to experience humour, although the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence, and context. For example, young children may possibly favour slapstick, such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or cartoons (e.g., Tom and Jerry). Satire may rely more on understanding the target of the humour, and thus tends to appeal to more mature audiences. Nonsatirical humour can be specifically termed \"recreational drollery.\"[1][2]", "title": "Samo Soviet - Take A Picture Of Us Not A Video", "publishedDate": "2009-07-10T08:48:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "7q_IzWDaFUA", "description": "Video Created by :: The Merciful Servant YT Channel\nMerciful Servant on YouTube: http://full.sc/WWEURu\n\nSupport The Dawah - Click Here: http://www.gofundme.com/The-Daily-Reminder\n\nGaza is Calling - Click here to Answer: http://goo.gl/uCSw1\n\nCalling All Believers - The Syrian Crisis: http://goo.gl/cYgiy\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Angels Pray For You \u1d34\u1d30 \u2507 Amazing Reminder \u2507 The Daily Reminder \u2507\n\nAssalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakaathuhu\n\n*No Music was used in the production of this video\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Yourselves updated: \n\nTDR Website: http://TheDailyReminder.org (coming soon)\nTDR YT Channel: http://www.youtube.com/TheDailyReminder\nTDR fb Page: http://www.fb.com/TheDailyReminder\nTDR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/TDR_Network\nTDR on G+: https://www.google.com/+ThedailyreminderOrg\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo Courtesy of The Merciful Servant\n\nWebsite: http://www.MercifulServant.com\nOfficial YouTube Channel: http://full.sc/WWEURu\nMercifulServantHD: http://full.sc/PKjGAU\nOfficial Facebook Page http://full.sc/TmpKXr\nBrotherHood Facebook: http://full.sc/PKjSAj\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/merciservant\nInstagram: http://followgram.me/MercifulServant\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "The Angels Pray For You \u1d34\u1d30 \u2507 Amazing Reminder \u2507 The Daily Reminder \u2507", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T10:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7q_PPJ-LY7c", "description": "Dr. Nancy Young, otolaryngologist at Ann and Robert H.

It prefers a Light, Well Drained Soil; In a partly shaded location. Geebungs are frost & drought resistant. The Stems are erect with a smooth Bark; and light, hanging Branches.   The Leaves are Green, Narrow, Fine & Pine--Like - 5cm long.  \n\nFlowers are delightfully bright and yellow in colour. They are Tubular with 4 Sepal-like Petals; Flowers appear in clusters along the Branches.  \n\nThe Narrow Leaf Geebung Fruit change colour & ripen from Green to Yellow in the Tweed Heads Region of NSW.  They are ripe just before & shortly after falling off the tree. Very popular Bush Tucker for birds and animals. Fruit are Sweet, Soft, Pulpy Dupes; Large Single Seed.  Pulp is squeezed from the skin like a grape. A very tasty bush treat in summer.  \n\nPine Leaf Geebung - Persoonia pinifolia is very similar in appearance to the Narrow Leaf Geebung - Persoonia linearis and both are full of natural Sugars & a water source. At first glance and if not fruiting, they can be difficult to readily tell apart from each other in the Australian bush. \n\nMain notable distinguishing differences between the two Geebung species are the fruits which on the Pine Leaf Geebung are green and grow in terminal clusters that go black when ripe; the fruits of the Narrow Leaf Geebung are scattered in clusters along the branches and turn yellow when ripe.", "title": "Bush Medicine Man & Narrow Leaf Geebung - Wayne Peters B.Sc.", "publishedDate": "2014-02-05T03:19:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qjirdQmejc", "description": "A lecture in NYU 2008 on the subject: Body representations in Art and Science by Ben Baruch Blich", "title": "Body representations II  Ben Baruch Blich", "publishedDate": "2009-05-28T19:21:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qjns15Mi9Q", "description": "Hey folks , \nThis is a quick break down of the currency that is used in the UAE , I hope you enjoy and if you have any questions about the topic please feel free to ask :)\n\nDo you want to see more World How It Is videos ?\nHead over to  http://www.youtube.com/worldhowitis to see more of how the world is !\n\nFollow us on twitter and facebook for more ! :)\n\nTwitter: @worldhowitis\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/worldhowitis\n\nDon't forget to check out this awesome artist too :)\n\nMusic created by Andy Heller:\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/424365/andy-heller", "title": "UAE,How It Is - Currency", "publishedDate": "2013-05-27T20:26:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qk9xFYRNFo", "description": "A must-try activity should have a place in your itinerary, picking grapes straight from the vines in Baung, Launion.\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN News channel! - http://goo.gl/7lR5ep\nVisit our website at http://www.abs-cbnnews.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abscbnnews\n\nWatch the full episodes of Bandila on TFC.TV http://bit.ly/BANDILA-TFCTV and on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, http://bit.ly/BANDILA-IWANTV", "title": "Must try: Grape picking in La Union", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T19:20:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7qkD0hMlEVE", "description": "Bodybuilder David Henry does one-arm dumbbell rows and hits a few back poses while training at a Las Vegas gym.

Where is it? What does it do? What is pancreatic cancer? Symptoms of pancreatic cancer? What happens now? What tests will I have? Who will treat me? What research is being done? Where do I go for support?\n\nCancer Pancreas\n\nPancreatic cancer has gained attention from the diagnoses of several prominent figures, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who was diagnosed in 2003 and died Oct. 5, 2011. Jobs had an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of the disease. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and actor Patrick Swayze have also faced pancreatic cancer. Swayze died in 2009. The lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is about 1 in 78.\n\nWhat is the Pancreas?\n\nThe pancreas is a 6-inch-long spongy, tube-shaped organ located in the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. Pancreatic cancer occurs when malignant (cancerous) cells grow, divide, and spread in the tissues of the pancreas.\n\nSymptoms of Pancreatic Cancer\n\nThe pain may become worse after the person eats or lies down.

The adaptive immune system is a more complex response to invaders that do penetrate into the body, primarily through an inflammation response. \n\nLet's begin with innate immunity, which is something we are born with and does not continuously change as does the adaptive immune system. Innate immune protection is always present in exposed parts of the body most vulnerable to the outside environment, such as our eyes, skin, nose, mouth, lungs and digestive system. Mast cells and natural killer cells play dominant roles in our innate immune defenses. \n\nThe second type of immune protection in the human body is our aquired immunity, which is also know as the adaptive immune system because it has the ability to adapt to recognize and fight new antigens. Since our environment is full of countless invading substances, that are biologically evolving and changing all the time, it is essential to our survival that we have a defense system that is capable of adapting to the changing threats as they occur. When we encounter a foreign substance, our adaptive immune cells jump into action. Unique white cells are then developed to destroy the foreign invader and also to remember it for the future. This process in the adaptive immune system is called immunization.", "title": "Video 12 Innate Immunity and Adaptive Immunity", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T14:04:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7r4lfvvys3Q", "description": "Shop Brooks PureConnect: http://ow.ly/Ann07 \n\nPlease subscribe to our channel: http://youtube.com/runningshoesvideo\n\nThe only thing that comes between you and the road?

He snowboards some of the most dangerous and exotic back country terrain in the world. If you don't already know him, you should.\n\nTravis Rice grew up the son of a ski patrolman in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. At 18, he drove out to Mammoth, CA and weaseled his way into the Superpark Competition, beating out the competition when he launched a backside rodeo over a 110-foot gap jump. After that performance, Rice was asked to be a part of his first sports action film, Transcendence. Since then, he was won countless awards, including two X-Games Gold Medals and starred in the critically acclaimed snowboarding films: First Descent, Art of Flight and That's It, That's All.\n\nIn 2012, Travis launched the first-ever Red Bull Supernatural in Bald Face, British Columbia, where he invited the 18 best back country snowboarders in the world to compete in natural conditions. It was the ultimate contest for the best all-around snowboarder and Travis aptly paced the competition.\n\nThe future is bright for Travis Rice, with everyone waiting to see what he will do next, not just as a snowboarder, but as one of the sport's true innovators.\n\nCredits:\n\nAimee Denaro, Producer\nMike Kattenburg, Editor\n\nJames Weitz, Camera\nLindsay Rappaport, \"B\" Camera\n\nThanks to:\n\nRed Bull Media House\nBrain Farm Cinema\nTransition Productions\nKemp Curley\nCurt Morgan\nDegree, Masters of Movement\nWeber Shandwick, Chicago", "title": "Travis Rice: Snowboarding into the Future", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T13:09:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "7r66XXIZSp4", "description": "Vomitory drummer Tobias Gustafsson in Leon Music Studios during the recording of the new Vomitory album \"Carnage Euphoria\".

The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera. Hamsters are crepuscular and remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators. In the wild, they feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects. They have elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders in which they carry food back to their burrows. Hamsters tend to sleep during the day and are wide awake at night, which may be irritating to some people because of their cage-biting and wheel-running. Hamster behavior varies depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people. Because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals. Hamsters have also become established as popular small house pets, and are sometimes accepted even in areas where other rodents are disliked, and their typically solitary nature can reduce the risk of excessive litters developing in households. Although the Syrian hamster or golden hamster was first described scientifically by George Robert Waterhouse in 1839, researchers were not able to successfully breed and domesticate hamsters until 1939. The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters appear to be descendants of a single brother-sister pairing. These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo [Syria] by Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, the hamsters bred very successfully. Years later, animals of this original breeding colony were exported to the USA, where Syrian hamsters became one of the most popular pets and laboratory animals. Comparative studies of domestic and wild Syrian hamsters have shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain. However, the differences in behavioral, chronobiological, morphometrical, hematological, and biochemical parameters are relatively small and fall into the expected range of interstrain variations in other laboratory animals. bred breed breeds breeding mates mating pregnant pregnancy litter baby babies hamster hamsters gerbil gerbils squirell squirells raccoon raccoons rat rats mice mouse rodent rodents pet pets shop shops diet diets wheel wheels spin spins spinning feed feeding feeds nibble nibbles eat eats eating nibbling teeth fan fangs tooth omnivore omnivores pest pests possum possums opossum opossums vegetable vegetables cute cutest adorable funny fun funniest home video videos animal animals health healthy rabid rabies cage caged cages feces Early literature Hamsters are typically stout-bodied, with tails shorter than body length, and have small, furry ears, short, stocky legs, and wide feet. They have thick, chipmunk chipmunks silky fur, which can be long or short, colored black, grey, honey, white, brown, yellow, red, or a mix, depending on the species. Two fail fails species of hamster belonging to the genus Phodopus, Campbell's dwarf hamster and the Djungarian hamster and two of the genus Cricetulus, the Chinese striped hamster and the Chinese hamster have a dark stripe down their heads to their tails. The species of genus Phodopus are the smallest, with bodies 5.5 to 10.5 cm long; the largest is the European hamster measuring up to 34 cm long, not including a short tail of up to 6 cm The Angora hamster, also known as the long-haired or teddy bear hamster, which is a type of the golden hamster is the second-largest hamster breed, measuring up to 18 cm long. A white Syrian hamster showing large incisors The hamster tail can be difficult to see, as it is usually not very long, with the exception of the Chinese dwarf hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very flexible, but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold. Senses Hamsters have poor eyesight; they are nearsighted and colorblind. Hamsters have scent glands on their flanks (and abdomens in Chinese and dwarf hamsters) which they rubs against the substrate leaveing a scent trail to follow to return to its home.[citation needed] Hamsters also use their sense of smell to identify pheromones and gender, and to locate food. They are also particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the ultrasonic range. Diet Hamsters are omnivores. Although pet hamsters can survive on a diet of exclusively commercial hamster food, other items, such as vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts, can be given. Hamsters in the Middle East have been known to hunt in packs to find insects for food. Hamsters are hindgut fermenters and eat their own feces to recover nutrients digested in the hindgut, but not absorbed", "title": "5 hamster babies in my palm!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T02:47:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "7rCNMW_UxPs", "description": "\u0906\u0909\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u0936\u0940\u0932 \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u092c\u0928\u094c\u0901, \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0938\u0941\u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0914\u0901! \u0905\u092c \u092c\u093f\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a \u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0948 \u092c\u0938\u094d\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0907\u0928 \u0906\u092b\u0948 \u0939\u0941\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u094b! \n\u25b6\u092b\u0947\u0938\u092c\u0941\u0915\u092e\u093e: http://facebook.com/bibeksheelnepali\n\u25b6\u0935\u0947\u092c\u0938\u093e\u0908\u091f: http://leadnepal.com \n\u25b6Hit \"Subscribe\" above.

And you notice I brought the knees slightly into my midsection. Okay? You can even extend out slightly. Okay. But then bring the knees in as the elbows come up. Okay. Keep the hands lightly on the back of the head. Keep the chin neutral. Looking right above eye level; really helps having a focal point to look at. High repetitions, and remember, bring the elbows in as the knees come in. Same time. So try not to rock back and forth when you do this. Just try to keep it nice and tight when you come up.

Poco tiempo despu\u00e9s, ante la indignaci\u00f3n de la elite literaria parisina, se convirtieron en amantes y comenzaron una tempestuosa relaci\u00f3n homosexual que termin\u00f3 con un episodio policial en 1873, cuando Verlaine, en medio de una pelea, le dispar\u00f3. Tras esa agresi\u00f3n (que le vali\u00f3 a Verlaine dos a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n), Rimbaud regres\u00f3 a Charleville, su pueblo natal, y se dedic\u00f3 a terminar la obra conocida como \"Una temporada en el infierno\".\nEn 1874 el escritor regres\u00f3 a Londres acompa\u00f1ado de su colega Germaine Nouveau y le dio forma a la controvertida \"Iluminaciones\". Un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s, el poeta vio por \u00faltima vez a Verlaine y se alej\u00f3 de las actividades literarias. A partir de ese entonces, viaj\u00f3 por Europa, se sum\u00f3 como soldado al ej\u00e9rcito holand\u00e9s para poder viajar gratis a Java (donde desert\u00f3 y regres\u00f3 en barco a Francia), recorri\u00f3 Chipre y se instal\u00f3 en Yemen.\nA\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Rimbaud se convirti\u00f3 en traficante de armas en Etiop\u00eda y as\u00ed consigui\u00f3 acumular una importante suma de dinero.

Instead, people who are happy and confident truly embrace life.  Dove believes that every woman is entitled to feel this way and to celebrate her own beauty.\n\nThat's why Dove is committed to making a real difference in women's lives by working with organizations and programs that foster strong self-esteem among Canadian women and by developing tools and resources that will help individuals and groups make a difference for themselves.\n\n\"Women and girls have their self-esteem undermined every day in our culture, so the Dove Self-Esteem Fund is a much-needed resource,\" says Dr. Carla Rice, clinician and professor.\n\nConsider the following statistics:\n\nBody image dissatisfaction has been consistently found in girls as young as nine years old.1 \nSeveral studies have demonstrated a desire to be thinner in girls as young as seven.2 \nOnly two percent of women globally consider themselves beautiful.3 \nSixty-three per cent of women strongly agree that women today are expected to be more attractive than their mother's generation.3\n\n\u3010For more amazing movies, please check http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=sammitea \u3011", "title": "\u2605\u2606\u2605 The Dove self-esteem Fund", "publishedDate": "2007-03-02T12:28:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "7rSmEXfNa2A", "description": "Eagles by Ataraxis Vibration.

The pieces were written almost entirely in Medieval Latin; a few in Middle High German, and some with traces of Old French or Proven\u00e7al. Many are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular.\nThey were written by students and clergy when the Latin idiom was the lingua franca across Italy and western Europe for travelling scholars, universities and theologians. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who sent up and satirized the Church.

At around the 00:15 I talked about it in detail. Here is some more information on How to Improve IQ:\n\n\"In today's competitive and global world many people can do the job that you do, therefore, any trait to distinguish yourself from competition can make the difference in your school, university or job. One way to distinguish yourself from others is through the increase of your intelligence. Just imagine what you can do with a higher IQ: get better grades, go to a better university, get an better job, get  promoted quicker etc.  In this article, I want to teach you an easy way to increase you intelligence into the stratosphere, using special sounds and music sessions based on brainwave entrainment and binaural beats....\"\n\nIf you liked my How to Improve IQ review click here to learn more: http://howtoimproveyouriq.com/\n\nHow To Improve Your IQ\nImprove IQ\nHow To Improve IQ Level\nHow To Increase Intelligence\nIncrease Intelligence\nHow To Increase IQ\nIncrease IQ\nTest Your IQ\nHow to Improve IQ\nHow to Improve IQ review\nHow to Improve IQ reviews\nHow to Improve IQ scam\nHow to Improve IQ discount\n\nThe intelligence quotient, or IQ, is measured by using the formula 100 X (mental age/chronological age). Most people\u0092s intelligence quotient is somewhere around 100, but there are also people who have lower IQ (especially those persons who have suffered some kind of traumas in their past or who suffer from a mental condition) or higher IQ (those people considered to be geniuses). In this latter category, important scientific people can be included, such as Albert Einstein, who had an IQ of 170 and Isaac Newton, whose IQ is said to be not less than 200.\n\nIt is necessary to mention that the value of your IQ is not something you are born with. Rather, your intelligence increases with time. Thus, the older you get, the more intelligent you become. Yet, in addition to age, the IQ is also directly proportional with the amount of time spent and effort made in order to train your brain. As you probably know, in order to be capable of learning more and have a higher IQ, you should train your brain continuously. Training means do a lot of reading and problem solving.\n\nClick here to visit the official How to Improve IQ website: http://howtoimproveyouriq.com/\n\nHow To Improve Your IQ |Improve IQ | How To Improve IQ Level", "title": "How To Improve Your IQ | Improve IQ | How To Improve IQ Level", "publishedDate": "2013-08-10T17:31:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7rhcq2z_gmk", "description": "A film by B3\nBrian/Borja/Bojesen", "title": "Juncture", "publishedDate": "2008-01-28T14:37:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7rhhuQJiguI", "description": "For more details click here: http://www.visualtour.com/showvt.asp?t=2816213\n\n8 Shoemaker Drive\nSwedesboro, NJ 08085\n$184,900, 3 bed, 1.5 bath, 1,763 SF, MLS# 5987833\n\nOpen House 6/24 1-4pm!!!\n8 Shoemaker Drive is an EXQUISITE 3 bedroom townhome that will sweep you off your feet.

Highland Regiments raised in the 18th and early 19th centuries employed many unique symbols to differentiate themselves from other regiments and enlisted distinctive music to announce their arrival, but as a result of the Cardwell Reforms of 1881, all British Army Highland Regiments were required to use 'Highland Laddie' as their regimental march. Over time, many of these regiments had managed to return to their pre-Cardwell marches when, in March 2006, the establishment of the Royal Regiment of Scotland saw the disappearance of all Scotland's historic infantry regiments and their distinctions, including music, and the adoption of a new regimental march, \"Scotland the Brave\".

To allow this rapid growth, continuous delivery of membrane and cell wall material to the growing tip of the hair cell is required. A component part of this material is protein, which is synthesized by ribosomes along the Endoplasmic Reticulum, modified in the Golgi apparatus and packaged into vesicles. The vesicles are finally delivered to the plasma membrane by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. How do vesicles find their target membranes? The specificity of target recognition is mediated by the interaction of v-SNARE proteins on the vesicle surface with t-SNARE proteins on the target membrane. Among others, small G-proteins regulate this process. One group of small G-proteins is the so-called RabGTPases. \nTo visualize the distribution of such RabGTPase proteins within the cell, they are tagged with the Green Fluorescent Protein. The video shows the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, zooming in on the root hairs, which display movement of fluorescent vesicles through the cytoplasm, and finally one can see an animation of myosin VI motor proteins dragging the fluorescently marked vesicles along actin filaments.\n\n\nThis video is part of the videocontest at http://www.chlorofilms.org", "title": "fantastic vesicle traffic", "publishedDate": "2009-04-11T10:27:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7sSCN57dwCM", "description": "Created on November 1, 2009 using FlipShare.", "title": "PVC Pipe Skein Winder", "publishedDate": "2009-11-02T13:58:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "7sSW9dfluKE", "description": "White-necked Puffbird (Notharchus hyperrhynchus) has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion \n\nThe population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable.

She says the 13-year-old has endured months of racial harassment and bullying from fellow students and teachers.\n\nCoon has asked Kansas City Public Schools to allow them to transfer him out of the district.\n\nShe said, \"They really kind of brushed me off.\"\n\n\"I had asked for transfers, they had told me no,\" Coon explained, \"And this was several months ago.\"\n\nStaying at East High was uncomfortable before. Now, it's unbearable.\n\nShe said, \"I will never, ever send any of my children to the Kansas City school district ever again.\"\n\nAn incident that left her eighth grade traumatized was the last straw.\n\nThe boy told police that two teens followed him home from school on Feb. 28. He said the attack happened on his family's front porch, when the two teens lit gas on fire, burning the boy.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Police wouldn't speak on camera about the incident on Tuesday. Though, did tell 41 Action News, that after several interviews with the boy, they don't believe the incident needs to be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nThe boy's family disagrees.\n\nAfter months of racial harassment sand bullying inside the walls of East High School, they believe the teens attacked him because of the color of his skin.\n\nNow, he has burns on his face, and his eyebrows and eyelashes are growing back. Coon says the boy doesn't leave home without his sunglasses on, out of embarrassment.\n\nCoon added, the boy is taking anti-depressants and seeing a therapist to manage flashbacks he has of the attack.\n\nShe said, \"He can't smell anymore, he lost his sense of smell from the incident.\"\n\nCoon's other two children go to a near-by charter school, that she said won't accept her son mid-semester. She and her fiancee are both students, so she says there isn't money to move or to pay for private school.\n\nShe told 41 Action News' Beth Vaughn her family is out of options.\n\nKansas City Public Schools told 41 Action News it wouldn't comment on the incident until the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department's investigation had concluded.\n\nChief Communications and Community Engagement Officer, Eileen Houston-Stewart wrote, \"The district did offer to transfer the student to any school in the district, we offered a home-bound teacher to go to any location of the parent's choice where the student would get one-on-one instruction and we offered to provide counseling. We did not offer to pay for medical bills.\"\n\nHowever, Coon says the district has refused to give her what she really wants, a free-pass out of KCPS.\n\nShe explained, \"We're not asking for them to pay for buses. We're not asking them to pay for a special cab. We're asking them to hand us a piece of paper or transfer a piece of a paper to another school, so be it, be safe, be somewhere else.\"\n\nFor now, she's keeping her son safe at home. Though, admits she's been warned that law enforcement could get involved if too much time passes with him out of school.", "title": "Discrimination Against White People in America Exposed part 3", "publishedDate": "2012-03-07T00:21:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7sYH4W_i-w4", "description": "", "title": "Full HD \"\u7d20\u76f4\u306b\u306a\u308c\u305f\u3089\" JUJU w-inds", "publishedDate": "2013-07-24T12:00:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "7sYLKcrndiE", "description": "My cover of The Condescension Song.

Love being me again and can't wait to be a mommy!!!! bcopi. Have the docs tested ferritin and vitamin D levels?. I know for a fact that they haven't specifically ordered those tests. However, I know they do a very detailed blood workup on you when you get pregnant. Shamefully, I have forgotten at every OB appointment to get a copy of these results. I have to be forgiven somewhat, because I was pretty much just trying to not throw up for months. I had no idea that there was a relationship between low cortisol and nausea/vomiting. Makes sense and gives me hope that maybe my next pregnancy, I won't feel like dying to get away from the sickness if I can get it under control. Seriously, I wouldn't wish HG on my worst enemy. So what can be done for low cortisol during pregnancy?. Just got the call from my doctor and got my last two lab results from them. The first is when I really started to feel Hypo prior to that, I felt fine except for the HG symptoms, which were all encompasing . If you are in fact over range by that much, it would suggest that there is a reason you are pooling. Cortisol seems like the most likely culprit. I'm so sorry you are going through this right now. Love being me again and can't wait to be a mommy!!!! bcopi. I agree with Bree Keep in mind also that thyroid hormones bind with estrogen. Estrogen increases with pregnancy, resulting in increased binding. Ooh, good call Laurie! Didn't even think of that. Thyroid function tests are not uncommonly ordered during pregnancy and interpreting the results is challenging. Physiologically, the concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone TSH normally decreases during the first trimester of pregnancy during which there is maximal cross-stimulation of the TSH receptor by HCG. The TSH concentration then returns to its pre-pregnancy level in the second trimester and then rises slightly in the third. However, most of the changes still occur within the normal non-pregnant range. Clinical indicators are usually confounding due to symptoms of pregnancy that can mimic thyrotoxicosis such as nausea, vomiting, heat intolerance, fatigue, anxiety and palpitations. The presence of a goitre, especially in patients with a borderline iodine deficiency, can further confound the diagnosis. Graves' disease is the commonest cause of true thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. Where there is prolonged and intractable nausea and vomiting, Graves' disease should be distinguished from hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy and transient hyperthyroxinaemia of pregnancy.
