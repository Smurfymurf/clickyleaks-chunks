Howitt's storyline branches in two directions: Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) loses her job at a classy London PR firm, has a run-in with a purse-snatcher, and just misses catching her boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with his former girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). But what if it were one of those days when everything goes right? As the sliding doors close while she stands on a subway platform in the London underground, Helen ponders the events in her alternate reality. The plot of Lord Dunsany's If also hinges on a future determined by catching or missing a train. Sliding Doors was shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"sliding doors\",\"sliding doors clip\",\"sliding doors trailer\",\"sliding doors part 1\",\"gwyneth paltrow\",\"jeanne tripplehorn\",\"john lynch\",\"peter howitt\",\"blanket videos\",\"romantic comedies\",\"british movies\",comedy,fantasy,romance,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"william horberg\",\"sydney pollack\",\"guy east\",\"nigel sinclair\",\"david wisnievitz\",\"helen booth\",\"philippa braithwaite\",\"sandy poustie\",\"adultery videos\",\"dating videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++160211,/m/074s4p,/m/0bq2g,/m/03_jy4", "title": "Sliding Doors (2/12) Movie CLIP - Caught Cheating (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-09-30T16:22:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1H3HbhbsTiM", "description": "Happy Channukah http://midnightabbi1eligoldsmith.wordpress.com/inspirations-for-today/", "title": "Belza Shines, Channukah lighting with the Rebbe!", "publishedDate": "2010-12-06T08:54:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1H3dMJul7Y0", "description": "Darkness Falls On #12.\nWhat will become of Mantis?!\nThis video created and provided by Cedar Point.\nFollow us on Instagram @FrontSeatCoasters http://instagram.com/frontseatcoasters .\nFollow us on Twitter @FrontStCoasters https://twitter.com/FrontStCoasters .\n\"Like\" us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/FrontSeatCoasters .", "title": "Cedar Point Mantis To Be Squashed In October!

Vivarium is a living ecosystem, and there's no better denizen of a vivarium than a poison dart, or a poison arrow frog. \n\nAgain, the jewels of the rain forest just are so brightly colored, that they're sought-after by collectors and hobbyists throughout the world. Unfortunately for the frogs in nature, they're disappearing. So these have now popped up because of the money that can be made by breeding them; there's captive breeders all over the country, that are supplying the pet world. And we're learning enough to leave the wild ones wild, which is very important to me in particular.\n\nDart frogs such as this need a forest floor. You see that we have them sitting on this beautiful moss with a piece of wood. This is living moss, this is living at the bottom of the tank they live in. There'll be a little waterfall in the background to keep the animal humid. They are a terrestrial creature, they're not really climbers, so they can't hop up onto logs, and they'll climb a little bit up any kind of a, an angled branch, \n\nBut they're not a tree frog; they definitely are denizens of the forest floor. Their bright colors, of course, tell predators and people alike that, watch out, there's poison here. Due to the fact that the frog gets its poison through a series of events of what it eats in the rainforest, they are not toxic in captivity, which is great. \n\nWe feed them fruit flies, actually flightless fruit flies, they don't fly out of your tank, which are also grown by breeders, and small crickets and other types of worms that will keep them quite happy in their forest home. I don't advocate grabbing them, but if you have to touch one, you will not die from the poison as you might with one in the wild, which is a very important thing if you're going to sell one to somebody.\n\nSo, poison arrow and poison dart frogs have caused somewhat of a revolution in the reptile amphibian industry, in that years ago, it was just snakes and lizards, snakes and lizards, but here, we've pulled all kinds of people into the hobby, because frogs, who doesn't like a frog, right? Everybody likes frogs, and this is something that can be kept in a 12 by 12 inch tank, what a conversation piece in the house, or living room, or office, to have something that sounds really exotic, sounds dangerous. \n\nIt's a poison arrow or poison dart frog, but we know better. They're just jewels of the rain forest, easy to keep, easy to feed, and just a fantastic, long-term, captive animal.", "title": "3 Care Tips for Poison Dart Frogs | Pet Reptiles", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T17:18:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "1H7gYUHHzD0", "description": "Witt Lowry - Common Sense (Freestyle) (Prod.

Hopefully you've been following our coverage so you know that there will be significant differences between the PC and console versions of the game.\n.\nMost notably, the graphics on PC will be a smooth 60 frames per second, while on consoles they will only be 30 fps. But that's not the only difference. DICE has confirmed that multiplayer matches on PCs will support 64 players, while console matches will only support 24 players. That is quite a jump in numbers but DICE thinks it is only necessary.\n.\nIn an interview with GameZone, Studio Head Patrick Bach said, \" We use the same engine, the same technology, the same animation system, the same lighting system. Our aim is to give the player the exact same experience and not try to dumb down the console version. \"\n.\nHe went on to say that in order to get more players in the console version, they would have had to scale down all the graphics, scale down all the destructibility, and sometimes scale down the map sizes. Clearly, DICE wants their fans to be happy but compromises need to be made. I think he is probably right. Wouldn't you prefer to have a games that looks better, plays better, and is just as fun as the PC version?

It's one of my songs that I'm the most proud of, and the video is honestly everything I'd hoped.\n\n\"Under Construction\" was written when I was a wistful fourteen-year-old who had watched one too many romantic comedies. It was my backyard. It was twilight. It was cold. I was sitting there against my family's old trampoline, listlessly strumming my guitar like if I played it enough, it would put in my path that thing I so desperately wanted: to fall in love.\n\nThat didn't happen.\n\nWhat did happen, though, was somehow even better. It was a realization; a realization that made me feel somehow both \"full and hollow\", like the magnificent Joni Mitchell sings out in her song \"Cactus Tree\". It was a realization that has occurred to millions before me and will to millions after, but in that moment it felt huge: at twilight, in my backyard, in the cold, I realized that I couldn't fall in love. Not yet. I wasn't ready. \n\n\"That was your big realization?\" you may be asking (with emphasis on the \"that\", which you will unfortunately have to imagine because YouTube doesn't have italics). But I was fourteen. I was that age where every realization is a big realization, even the ones that you've heard other people talk about, because you're fourteen and you're finally getting to experience the world in a way that is completely your own. The discoveries you make don't belong to anyone but you. And every time you make one of these discoveries, it's huge.\n\nAt twilight, in my backyard, in the cold, I realized that love would find me when it believed me to be strong enough to handle it. \n\nMy fingers formed a new chord. My lips formed the words \"I've got a heart...\" and at twilight, in my backyard, in the cold, I wrote \"Under Construction\". \n\nI'm eighteen now. I still watch one too many romantic comedies. Every so often, I like to go out in my backyard at twilight and think about this song. The trampoline isn't out there anymore, but I still feel that familiar pull: love is out there for me. And it's going to be at my door very soon. \n\nAnd I hope, if you're not already in love right now, it's right around the corner for you too.\n\n-Justine\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/JustineDorseyMusic", "title": "Justine Dorsey - Under Construction (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T20:59:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HJGJLojC_c", "description": "Depois de uma hora de espera na fila, fomos na tao famosa \" Le Monstre\", a maior montanha russa de madeira do mundo, e depois de tentar filmar em quase todas as outras e as tentativas falharam, nessa deu certo!

An HMO is an health maintanance organization and even though HMOs are portrayed as a bad guy on tv and movies sometimes, it really is a legimate way to receive your health insurance and health care. What happens in the health maintanance organization, HMO is part of your premium each month goes to the meidical group and they use that money to take care of you so they receive the same amount whether they see you or not. So they are definitely incentivised to keep you healthy.  You usally have to pike a primary health care doctor and receive a referral to a specialist and you stay within their medical group for all of your lab, xray and hospitalization. They want to keep you healthy with preventative care and if something happens to you they'll provide the care you need.\nPPO is on the other hand a preferred provider organization. So they're a netowrk of doctors who have agreed to prenegotiate discounts from the insurance company and you can go see any of them any time you choose. YOu won't need a referral to a specialsit you can go to whichever hospigtal is in your network. In fact, PPO networks are usually national so you can receive care in this county or the next county or even across the nation and still be in the network. Those are the main differences between an HMO and PPO. From a cost standpoint, HMO's are generally less expensive in terms of premium and amount you have to pay to receive care and the PPO is generally more expensive both in terms of premium and how much it costs to go to the hospital.\nwww.moorebenefitsinc.com/video-center", "title": "HMO vs. PPO, what's the difference?", "publishedDate": "2010-07-31T10:38:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HQ7ii8VuIM", "description": "Anseriformes / Anatidae / Chinese goose", "title": "Chiba Zoological Park 05", "publishedDate": "2006-10-04T14:01:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HQCRv7iV6I", "description": "Check out our full written Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014 edition review: http://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/samsung-ativ-book-9-2014-review/\n\nThe hordes of Ultrabooks that pass through our offices have left us jaded to the thinness of such devices, but the Samsung ATIV Book 9 manages to overcome our cynicism. Thickness comes in at just 16 millimeters, despite the 15.6-inch screen. This means that the 15.6-inch Samsung ATIV Book 9 is thinner than the 13-inch MacBook Air. The slim profile is further enhanced by tapered edges that make the laptop feel even smaller than its diminutive dimensions suggest.\n\nWe weren't initially enthused with the ATIV Book 9's display, but only because of the system's insanely aggressive adaptive dimming which, when turned on, often rendered the laptop unusable. When turned off, the screen shimmered with a maximum output of 290 lux. Further tests revealed that the display can render 97 percent of the sRGB gamut, and reach a contrast ratio of 620:1 at maximum brightness.\n\nSamsung's ATIV Book 9 is essentially a 15-inch MacBook Air. If you've ever wanted such a thing, well, here's your chance to own it, albeit with Windows 8.1 instead of OS X. The ATIV Book 9\u2032s razor-thin profile, minimal heft, and bright display make it more portable than some 13-inch Ultrabooks, yet it still provides the space and comfort of a large, mainstream laptop.\n\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/computer-videos/samsung-ativ-book-9-2014-video-review/", "title": "Samsung ATIV Book 9 2014 Edition video review", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T22:18:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HQeDG3EGWQ", "description": "", "title": "arteria toraxica", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T06:13:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HQfJNlqxjc", "description": "\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc\u30ec\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u306e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u306e\u5165\u3063\u305f\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\u3002\nCD\u8ca9\u58f2\u306e\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\nhttp://tokinogoraikoudou.net/\n\nCD\u306e\u8aac\u660e\nhttp://mixi.jp/view_community.pl?id=2398993", "title": "\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc\u30ec\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\uff23\uff24\u300006\u30a6\u30a9\u30eb\u30ca\u30c3\u30c8 Juglans regia", "publishedDate": "2009-06-12T23:09:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HRBYRrXHMs", "description": "For the second year, Louis participated the Performathon in Hyde Park.Every year at the end of May or beginning of June, the Music Teachers of Hyde Park has a two-day event which takes place at the Blackstone Library and at Montgomery Place.

The music school introduced a bold new concept in music education: that students had time to become familiar with their homework and practice without pressure. Memorization of music was removed from study. Review and daily practice were emphasized at this music school.\n\nBeginning in three rooms, the school trained mostly Florida-based players in the ways of reading, soloing, and comping on their instruments. Harmony and ear training classes were added to round out the players' need for a broader musical understanding.\n\nWith the need for more space, the music school moved to a larger facility in 1998 and added new playing programs to the music schools course list. In 1999, the music school moved locations to one of the most beautiful sights for a music school in the world: the historic Kapok Gardens. With its waterfalls, sculptures, tropical flora, and ivy-covered walls, the Players School is a music school that has one\nof the most unique settings for music studies anywhere. In March 1999, Department of Education of the State of Florida licensed The Players School of Music as the only \"alternative private independent music school in the State. Currently, no other privately run music schools in Florida is similarly licensed.\n\nIn 2000, many new changes took place to the music school. The US Department of Homeland Security has authorized The Players School of Music to enroll foreign students. The school began its Master Class Series by inviting outside professionals from every area of music to come and teach. Renowned guest musicians, recording industry personnel, and a variety of music-connected professionals come and lecture to our student body at our music school.\n\nPlaying well and learning well is our motto. The school continues to upgrade its programs with new methods of playing and practicing to help you learn music on and off your instrument.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nABOUT JEFF BERLIN\n\nJeff Berlin is a legend of the electric bass guitar. Simply put, he is considered by many to be the finest electric bass player in the world and one of the best bass guitar teachers who provide music lessons and music education anywhere.  Noted for his fluid lyrical playing, he is also a pioneer of slap bass when he brought this percussive-style bass playing in 1979 to a new audience on the tune called 5G! Jeff Berlin also pioneered two handed tapping when he performed this style on the tune Motherlode from his 1985 release of his first solo album called \"Champion.\".\n\nJeff Berlin is known as a major innovator on the bass guitar through his incisive playing through recordings and performances for the last thirty years. Jaco Pastorius regarded Jeff Berlin as a better soloist than he was. Geddy Lee from the rock group, Rush, referred to Jeff Berlin as the \"greatest bass player on the planet\". Marcus Miller told people that he wanted to be the \"Black Jeff Berlin.\"\n\nThe founder of The Players School of Music in the Tampa Bay / Clearwater, Florida area, Jeff  Berlin has also been at the front of music education for almost 30 years. His column in Guitar Player and Bass Player magazines were the most read columns due to their precise content emphasizing music education over more popular learning concepts aimed at technique-type instruction.\n\nHis numerous recording credits include six highly acclaimed solo records, Champion, Pump It!, Taking Notes, In Harmony's Way, Lumpy Jazz and Aneurythms. Jeff Berlin tours with his band that has features ex. Pat Metheny drummers Danny Gottlieb and Paul Wertico, steel drummer Othello Molineaux, trumpet player Randy Brecker and pianist/bassist Richard Drexler. He also toured with BX3, a bass conglomeration that includes the great bass players Stuart Hamm and Billy Sheehan. In 2009 Jeff Berlin toured with guitarist John Abercrombie and drummer Adam Nussbaum. Jeff Berlin also played bass guitar in Asia in an explosive trio with drummer Dennis Chambers, and guitarist Scott Henderson.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAmplifier provided by Markbass.\n\nBass guitars provided by Dean Guitars.", "title": "JEFF BERLIN Bass Lessons - Avoiding Fret Buzz - The Players School of Music", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T17:37:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HRqBETAcgs", "description": "Created with OSnap! for iOS\nhttp://www.osnapphotoapp.com", "title": "Uke Delivery", "publishedDate": "2014-05-31T19:51:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HSCSDfvE2E", "description": "Cute little teeny nightsnake (Hypsiglena torquata)", "title": "19mar09 - nightsnake", "publishedDate": "2009-03-26T07:41:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HSE7mHefrM", "description": "", "title": "Big planaria worms", "publishedDate": "2011-12-17T18:11:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HSE9xYB69k", "description": "Pink Heath\n\nnative heath,\n\naustralian pink heath,\n\npink heath cultivation,\n\ncommon heath found,\n\ndoes common heath look like,\n\nepacris impressa,\n\ncommon heath flower,\n\nvictorian native flowers", "title": "Pink Heath", "publishedDate": "2014-01-05T12:14:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HSHrsRAPcs", "description": "Os invito a dar un paseo por alguna de las calles de un pueblo con mucho encanto enclavado en la Sierra Norte de Sevilla.", "title": "Guadalcanal... conocelo.", "publishedDate": "2010-03-02T20:57:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HThMZ8nxJw", "description": "", "title": "black body boyz", "publishedDate": "2010-01-05T00:08:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HU5NPG29Bo", "description": "", "title": "Wash House Band 2009 Part 1", "publishedDate": "2010-04-29T03:46:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HV8PdXLzy8", "description": "Vascular plant tissue tutorial.

It was shot and edited by Wayne Houchin, and scored by none other than Dana Hocking. \n\nSoftbound 126 pages. \n\nNow Available here: \nhttp://www.leeasher.com/store/books/paper_engine.html\n(cut and paste if not clickable)\n\n- - - - - -\n\nLarry Jennings remarked that Aaron Fisher was the most promising young card magician he had seen in the past twenty years. John Thompson says, \"The material in this book is top notch, and I guarantee it will enhance the repertoire of any serious student of card magic immensely.\" Praise for Aaron Fisher's work has spread through the inner circles of card magic for several years, resulting in a growing demand for information on the innovative techniques and card magic devised by Fisher; magic with which he has been impressing and amazing audiences of all calibers.\n\nThe Paper Engine begins with a thorough explanation of Aaron Fisher's handling of the half pass, a handling unlike any other in that there are no overt turns, sweeps, or squaring of the cards used to hide the sleight. Fisher's gravity half pass is done in the small motion of raising the deck from dealing position to the fingertips. There is no other perceptible action\u2014yet the sleight is invisible from all sides. The details of this one move have been wondered about and coveted for years.\n\nEqually innovative are Fisher's approaches to the bluff pass, diminishing lift sequence, multiple shift, switches and controls. And last but not least is his one-handed method for causing a card to pop face up suddenly from the center of a face-down pack.\n\nThe Paper Engine, though, is much more than a collection of technical innovation. Supporting the sleights are nineteen excellent and powerful tricks that rely on them. These are not constructions cobbled together to illustrate how the sleights might be applied. The tricks are all audience-tried-and-tested pieces of magical entertainment, drawn from Aaron Fisher's professional repertoire. And all sleights and tricks are supplemented with observations on presentation, practicality, psychology, and theatrical theory, expressed with a clarity and candor that will surprise readers.\n\nThe Paper Engine is Aaron Fisher's first book, and for it he has chosen only what he considers his top card material, to which he has added two exceptional tricks by Gordon Bean that use his techniques. Aaron and his co-author John Lovick have striven to provide a text that teaches clearly and succinctly on many levels. They are aided in this by Damon Webster who supplies 160 state-of-the-art photos. The result is a work that, rather than spinning its wheels in well-worn ruts, drives the craft of card magic forward into the future.\n\n- - - - - -\n\n\"Before reading this book I was looking to find something that can teach me more card sleights and unique tricks and that are impromptu where I can just do a trick with a normal pack of cards. This book was exactly what I needed\n\nTruth is, I never buy books. I am more of a person that learns from watching DVDs. However, since this book got so many great reviews and everyone has just been talking about the Gravity Half Pass I decided to go for it and I did not regret it. \"  -- Matt Tan\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\n\"It taught me how vital it was to eliminate tension from my sleights and to execute them with a soft yet consistent touch on those elusive pressure points. By showing me how to do so, the Paper Engine has improved my card work immeasurably. \"  -- Wayne C.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \n\nYou won't master the techniques and methods taught in The Paper Engine overnight. However, you'll be amply rewarded for the time you spend on this material. Study this book and you'll misdirect audiences with new found ease, and your touch with cards will soften. Mastering the core concepts of tension, focus and design will help you grow as both a technician and as an entertainer. That's what this book is for. If you're ready to elevate your card magic, The Paper Engine will speed you on your journey.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.leeasher.com/store/books/paper_engine.html", "title": "Aaron Fisher's Paper Engine - Trailer by Wayne Houchin", "publishedDate": "2009-03-02T20:09:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HcWqJBSvkU", "description": "Justyna, from the Award Winning Pearla na Mara, shows Solaris how to make a simple Rooibos Espresso Cappucino.", "title": "How to Make a Rooibos Espresso in 3 Simple Steps", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T10:46:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HcfVIxAuFI", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/Buncarul26", "title": "Riga Kripto - Bauer (prod.

That opens it up to interpretation. If you wonder whether your child has ADHD, work with a doctor who follows nationally recognized standards set forth by governing pediatric and psychiatric groups.\n\n\"A lot of people think they can just spot a child and say 'oh that child is hyper active'. Meaning that sure it's an active child, it engages in a lot of gross motor behavior, but that doesn't mean that child has a disorder,\" says Dr. Elena Reyes, clinical psychologist with Lee Memorial Health System. \n\nA key point in making an ADHD diagnosis is that symptoms must be present in more than one setting. Which is why the evaluation includes observations from parents, caregivers and teachers.\n\n\"When we actually do an evaluation for ADHD we really try to do a thorough evaluation. So what you're doing is not only observing the child, you're getting information from the parents but you're also getting information from the teacher. Because one of the things we know the demand characteristics in the classroom are very different than for example the dinner table or watching TV,\" says Reyes. \n\nA psychologist, pediatrician or neurologist will rate a child's behavior compared to peers. Symptoms to look out for are: constant motion, fidgeting, distractedness and inability to finish tasks. Evaluations should wait until age seven. And remember, ADHD isn't a blanket for every bothersome behavior.\n\n\"It may just be a cause of today's technology- with kids being in front of iPad's and iPhones, tablets, whatever,\" says Willing. \n\n\n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n\nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

Depending on the stage of their life cycle, if plants get over-crowded, the female black bean aphids may grow wings and fly to another plant where they take advantage of their ability to reproduce asexually and start a new population. They suck sap out of plants and turn it into nectar. The nectar attracts ants which \"milk\" the aphids then return the favour by transferring them to less populated plants.

This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less than two-thirds of the length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bean_aphid \n\nA black or very dark brown species with a variable abdominal sclerotic pattern - confined to abdominal tergites 6-8 in smaller apterae but broken bands present in larger ones. The siphunculi and cauda are dark. The antennae have joints of III-IV and base of V usually quite pale. Marginal tubercles are protuberant but small. The longest femoral and tibial hairs are longer than the least width of tibiae. Apterae (see second picture below) often, and immatures (see first picture below) very often, have discrete white wax spots. The body length of apterae is 1.2-2.9 mm.

Photo means light, and Tropism is growth in plants from an environmental stimulus. So Phototropism is A plants reaction to light, growing in a certain way and direction.\nGrowing towards light is known as positive phototropism, and growing away from light is known as negative phototropism. Most plants usually show positive phototropism where as roots usually show the negative kind. Sometimes bind shoots use negative phototropism to climb up dark objects, such as walls, to find more light. Phototropism uses auxin's, which are plant hormones, which have lots of uses. Here they are able to react to light, and break bonds in the cell walls. Making them less rigid. And making them swell up, and creating pressure, causing growth to grow in a different direction. Phototropism is directed by light receptors, such as, cryptochromes that detect blue light, and phytochromes that detect red light.\nThis normally takes place in the tip of the plant. A scientist once conducted a experiment on this. To do this he took three plants and cut the tips of and placed one in a normal box, and one in the same type of box but put a foil cone on its head , and finally with the last one put it again in the same kind of box but put a hole in the side. This one grew towards the hole, the one with the tin foiled hat on grew straight up and the plain one didn't grow at all. Phototropism is important for the plant as it can find more light and grow taller and taller.", "title": "PHOTOTROPISM for beginners", "publishedDate": "2011-03-27T14:02:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HplxfjjZfs", "description": "Desayuno Para Aumentar Masa Muscular - http://equipo90.com\n\nLos mejores desayunos completos para aumentar de masa muscular.

Today, a Suffolk prosecutor said the 50-year-old Russo was stabbed 69 times.\nThat testimony enraged the victim's brother who quickly rushed at the suspect, Peter Deconinck, 46, during today's arraignment. \nThe brother struggled with court officers while shouting at Deconinck. A witness said the brother cried out to court officers \"69 wounds ain't right\" as he was being hauled out of court. The brother was arraigned today for his outburst in court while Deconinck was ordered held on $1 million bail.\nThe brother, Thomas Russo, was let go on personal recognizance after pleading not guilty to two counts of resisting arrest and one count of disrupting court proceedings. Two court officers were also injured in the fray.\nOther relatives of Russo in the court burst into tears when the details of the alleged murder were recited in court.\nDeconinck was found near the MBTA Beachmont Station Saturday night \"with blood on his clothing and a laceration to his hand,\" authorities said, a short time after Russo's body was discovered. Investigators believe the two men had a fight sometime before 8:30 p.m., prosecutors said.\nJake Wark, spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, said state police charged Deconinck with Russo's slaying \"based on evidence recovered at the scene, witness interviews and his own statements.\"\nDeveloping ...", "title": "Wild Fight In A Courtroom!!

The word About this sound \"tickle\" (help\u00b7info) evolved from the Middle English tikelen, perhaps frequentative of ticken, to touch lightly.[1] The idiom tickled pink means to be pleased or delighted.[2]\n\nIn 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a \"tickle\" as two different types of phenomena.[3] One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter-inducing \"heavy\" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to \"ticklish\" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.\n\nThe question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.[4]\n\nFrancis Bacon and Charles Darwin belie", "title": "Dexter's Laboratory Tickle Scene 3", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T16:39:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "1HzjbdkpVtY", "description": "Boxing Instructional Videos - http://www.precisionstriking.ca/store/\nBoxing App (iTunes) - https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/precision-boxing-coach-pro/id702519995?mt=8\nBoxing App (Play) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forslabs.boxingappSupreme\nBoxing App (Windows) - http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/precision-boxing-coach/3640be46-f201-417e-83c3-fe142047514d\nBoxing gear by Ringside - http://www.ringside.com\nCheck me out on Instagram - http://instagram.com/jtvanv", "title": "Boxing - Alternative Angle Against Southpaws by Cutting to the Inside", "publishedDate": "2012-10-21T06:15:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1I-2PpADcHg", "description": "Let's get 200+ LIKES for \nWelcome Wonder to Avec!\n[Click 'show more' for the full description!]\n\nSup bitches I hope you had a great day or have a great day and enjoyed this!\n-Wonder(Height)\n\nI used to be Clear but no more so here is my Episode 1 and my ep2 will be out soon!\n-Wonder\n\nEdited by :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/\n\nLeader:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Wonderitive\nhttps://twitter.com/HeightBabe\n\nMusic:\nAstromphere - The Ropes", "title": "Visual Wonder: Wonderfulness- Episode 1", "publishedDate": "2013-04-30T03:04:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1I-aPVArPws", "description": "Thailand vs China PR 2-0 | Asian Games 2014 Football 25 September 2014\nThailand vs China PR 2-0 | Asian Games 2014 Football 25 September 2014\nThailand vs China PR 2-0 | Asian Games 2014 Football 25 September 2014 | http://youtu.be/1I-aPVArPws\n\nThailand 2-0 China, asian games 2014 football, \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 vs \u0e08\u0e35\u0e19", "title": "Thailand vs China PR 2-0 | Asian Games 2014 Football 25 September 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T16:05:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1I-z8ijrteQ", "description": "The Rhetoric Term: Anaphora is defined through a beautiful song.

While not fragrant like many of the Irises, it is a structural entity in the garden, even when not in bloom. The lupine is also a member of the Pea family, Fabaceae, which makes it useful as a cover crop, as forage and also as a companion plant to be intercropped with cucumbers, squash, broccoli, spinach and others.\n\nThe flowering or horticultural Lupine is a perennial plant, although among the almost three hundred species there are a few outlying woody trees and shrubs. Many treat Lupine as a biennial because they seem to die out after flowering the second year. Some varieties are more reliably perennial than others, so look for that when purchasing. Lupines do best in full sun, in well-drained average fertility soil. One can start seed (my preferred method) or you can find them at the better nurseries in pots for sale usually in spring.\n\nAgain depending on the species and variety, the flower color can range from yellow to blue, salmon pink to purple and almost red. Most of the types available as horticultural specimens are in the cooler range of purple to violet. The height is in the two-and-a-half to three-foot range when in flower, with multiple flower spikes emerging over a ten day to two-week period. Lupine flowers are not the best cut-flowers, but I have found if you cut them when no more than a third of the flowers have popped open (they open from the bottom of the flower working upwards), then they will last for several days in the vase. They are an unbelievably striking focal point in a large vase with just some fern leaves around the bottom.\n\nThe genus name Lupine comes from the root word lupinus, Latin for wolf. Lupine as an adjective also means savage, ravenous and predatory, all connected with the wolf. This may have something to do with the propensity for some species to become invasive, as on the South Island of New Zealand where L. polyphullus has covered stream banks and roadsides. The native Bluebonnet in Texas is a Lupine species L. texensis, but of course its predominance is welcome there as part of the spring display and indeed a deserving focus of festivals, tours and other events.\n\nEasily started from seed, it is best to start lupine seeds indoors in late winter, allowing them to grow to a nice sized plant before setting out in spring. They prefer good garden loam, a sunny location and adequate moisture while growing.  After they have flowered, they tend to go dormant and therefore don't need the rainfall that a vital plant would.  That being said, by dead-heading (removing the spent flowers before they set seed) and by watering and lightly fertilizing them, they will re-bloom but more sparsely through the \nsummer. \n\nThere are not a lot of worries with Lupines, but I have noticed that aphids like ours.  I wash them off with a stream of water every day or so, and they seem to get the idea that they are not wanted. They don't disappear, but   they do make themselves less obvious.", "title": "Lupine - Lupinus species", "publishedDate": "2012-12-28T14:01:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1IJoDUXtt50", "description": "\"Aviatrix: The Katherine Sui Fun Cheung Story\" documentary project teaser video.

There is ample parking in the vicinity and a selection of complementary shops and businesses nearby. The premises are situated in a densely populated residential area and are close to the local amenities including a supermarket, churches and a town hall. The business has a monopoly trading position and enjoys a high footfall and much passing trade. The premises are situated on the A5 and boast easy access to the surrounding towns, A-road network and the M1 motorway. Towcester is a busy market town and is a desirable place in which to live and work. The town is famous for its racecourse which was originally part of the Easton Neston country house estate, and Silverstone motor racing circuit which is approximately 4 miles away. Northampton lies 10 miles away, while Milton Keynes is approximately 11 miles away.\n\nBusiness History\nPreferred Commercial is delighted to offer for sale this computer repair and sales business, which was established by our client in 2002 and which is only now being offered to the market due to our client's wish to retire. The business trades 4\u00bd days a week and generates a turnover in the region of \u00a360,000 per annum with a gross profit of 54%. Our client offers computer repairs and sells second user computers and parts. 90% of the turnover is generated from computer repairs and the remaining 10% is from computer sales. We feel the turnover could be further increased by embarking on a modest marketing campaign as currently the majority of trade is generated from word of mouth recommendations. A new owner could extend the opening hours and trade 7 days a week if desired. There is a website in place advertising the business and services provided. The premises boast a spacious sales area and a workshop to the rear. There is also a large store room to the 1st floor, which could be utilised for another business. This is an ideal opportunity to acquire an already busy computer repair and sales business with scope for future growth. Early negotiations with Preferred Commercial must come highly recommended.\n\nFinancial Details\nT/O:                 \u00a360,000 approx.\nGP:                  54%\n\nOpening Hours\nTues -- Fri:       9:00am to 6:00pm\nSat:                  9:00am to 1:30pm\n\nAccommodation\n2-storey retail premises on a busy main road with ample parking.

Only for the first two years of his pontificate did he perform the feet-washing himself, after which the task was delegated to priests.\n\nEaster is the most important festival in the calendar of the Catholic Church.\n\nOn Good Friday evening the Pope will carry a wooden cross and pray at a ceremony at Rome's ancient amphitheatre, the Colosseum, commemorating Jesus' crucifixion.\n\nOn Saturday evening Pope Francis will celebrate the main Easter Vigil Mass in St Peter's Basilica.\n\nAnd on Easter Sunday morning, the new Pope will deliver his first \"Urbi et Orbi\" message to the city of Rome and to the world.\n\nDuring his inaugural general audience on Wednesday, Pope Francis called for an immediate political solution to the conflict in the Central African Republic after last weekend's coup.", "title": "Pope Francis washes feet of prisoners in pre-Easter Mass on maundy thursday", "publishedDate": "2013-03-28T18:54:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1IPytIjJ9CE", "description": "Hit the road with this incredible 2014 Forest River Surveyor 294QBLE.

The theme features the world of anthropomorphic creatures, called the Land of Chima, which is populated by at least 18 tribes and the war which threatens it.\n\nNine regular sets were featured in the first wave, in addition to six \"Speedorz\" sets with more gradually being released through the year.\n\nSpeedorz is a game introduced with the theme which includes one-wheeled bikes, called Speedorz, powered by a rip-cord. The game involves completing challenges and surpassing obstacles to earn Chi crystals, the mineral the animals are fighting over in the story.\n\nOn January 16, 2013 Legends of Chima: The Animated Series premiered with two pilot episodes. The cartoon continued again half-way through 2013, when the second wave of sets were released. There is also a second series in 2014.\n\nThree video games for the theme are currently known. One, known as Legends of Chima: Speedorz, was released on iOS devices on January 1, 2013 and shortly after as an online game. A second one is for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita, and is called LEGO Legends of Chima: Laval's Journey. The last one, an online game, that was released in Autumn 2013 is a massive multi-player online game called LEGO Legends of Chima Online. \n\nThe Land of Chima was once shared by several species of animals peacefully. After a natural disaster, a mountain rose into the sky and waterfalls began flowing to the land below. The animals that drank from it, at least ten species, evolved into anthropomorphic humans due to the Chi in the water. Not all the animals drank from it, and those who abstained left Chima. According to legend, these animals, called Legends Beasts, will return to Chima when they are needed.\n\nThe animals were able to live mostly peacefully for years. The Lion Tribe, who first drank from the river, distributed the Chi fairly, even to their enemies, to keep nature in balance. Squabbles were kept from turning into all out war by Speedorz tournaments. \n\nThis all changed when a young crocodile prince named Cragger placed a Chi orb in his chest before he became of age and was overwhelmed with the power that surged through him and became addicted. After convincing Worriz, the leader of the wolves, to accompany him, they sneaked into the Lion's Chi Temple to get more, but were caught by the Lion King, Lagravis, his son, Laval, and their guards, Leonidas and Longtooth.\n\nThis led to a battle between the Lion and Crocodile tribes when Cragger escaped (Worriz fled as soon as they were caught). In the battle, Cragger's parents, Crominus and Crunket, were caught in a fracture of the Earth and fell below. They survived, but were thought to be dead to the world.\nLaval on a Lion\n\nNotice of Fair Use:\nAll graphics and visual elements in this video are used for identification and commentary purposes only as provided for under United States Copyright Law. http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html \n\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING!!!", "title": "LEGO Legends of Chima: Fire and Ice KnockOff Minifigures Set 5 Laval, Eris & Cragger", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T18:07:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "1If2u8QrvRA", "description": "Complies with Bactericidal standard EN1276 and Fungicidal Standard EN1650\nOne shot self dispensing spray\n Treats in a single operation a wide range of unpleasant smells and allergens\nVery efficient and long lasting action against bad smells, leaves a long lasting fresh smell", "title": "Quick-Pur by ECOTEC additives for professional automotive maintenance", "publishedDate": "2010-10-15T07:49:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1IfECXuu_9Q", "description": "The NYPD is seeking the public's assistance in locating and identifying the following two (2) individuals in connection to a grand larceny within the confines of the 60 Precinct.

Initially hoping to document the positive effects a boarding school like this could have on struggling youth, evangelical filmmaker Kate Logan is granted unprecedented access and allowed to live on campus for the summer.  Once there, Logan's eyes are opened to the truth beneath the sunny fa\u00e7ade of this remote reform school\u2014kids being taken by force in the middle of the night, rumors of physical abuse, and staff imposing arbitrary and degrading punishments on the young students\u2014and encounters students who change her life.\n \nIn the 85-minute documentary, Logan meets David, a 17-year-old honor student from Colorado, sent to the program shortly after coming out to his parents; Beth, a 15-year-old from Michigan suffering from debilitating panic attacks; and Tai, a 16-year-old Haitian-American girl from Boston experimenting with drugs to cope with childhood trauma.  With mounting evidence that this so-called \"therapeutic boarding school\" is no more than a crude brainwashing camp, Logan is determined to help at least one student escape.  The struggles she faces to secure the child's freedom reveal just how far Escuela Caribe will go to prevent their students from leaving, becoming a journey that tests Logan's faith in ways she could never imagine.\n \nSpecial Jury Award Winner of the 2014 Nashville Film Festival and the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at 2014 Slamdance Film Festival, KIDNAPPED FOR CHRIST is executive produced by Lance Bass, Mike C. Manning and Tom DeSanto.

There's lots of different ways to hold them, and\nlots of different types of grips, different positions your hands are going\nto be in. So, to start off, right here, these two green holds are known as\nslopers. A good technique for slopers is to try to keep your weight\nunderneath the sloper, and you really want to maximize the amount of\nsurface contact you're getting with these holds. So as I move up the wall,\nI'm going to start on these two slopers, really trying to get as much of my\nhands on them as I can, keeping my weight nice and low.\n\nMy right hand now is coming to a hold known as a jug, which is a really big\npositive hold. I'm also holding this jug from the bottom, which means it's\nknown as an undercling. I'm actually pulling up on that hold. I'm going to\nmove my left hand in to another jug, but now I'm pulling on it to the side,\nso that hold is also known as a side pull.\n\nMy right hand is now moving to a hold known as a pinch, it's a pinch\nbecause I'm literally pinching it. Lots of holds can also work as pinches\nsimply by engaging that thumb, that's a really good technique, always try\nto engage that thumb.  Moving up a little farther, I come to another\nsloper, this time I'm going to be pushing against it with my thumb facing\ndown. This position is known as a Gaston. Now I'm matching this hold, two\nhands on the same hold is known as a match. Moving my left hand over, I\nhave another pinch. As I continue up the wall I can grab another jug here,\nonce again, this is going to be a side pull, because I'm pulling sideways\non it.\n\nThis pink hold here is known as a crimp, that you're going to get just your\nfinger tips on, and even wrap your thumb over your index finger to kind of\nmaximize how much pressure you can put on such a small point. Another crimp\nhere, this pink, guiding with my right hand, wrapping my thumb over that\nindex finger to really allow me to put a lot of force on a small space.\nMoving up, we have this final hold here, this big juggy hold, to finish\nreally big and positive. And that would be a good explanation of climbing\nholds and how to hold them.", "title": "How to Grip Indoor Climbing Holds | Rock Climbing", "publishedDate": "2013-08-17T04:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Ij3RSUY984", "description": "Do not back talk.. you never know!   loll enjoy!\nFeaturing & Special thanks to Celavii**\nPD M COMEDY\n\nSHARE/SUBSCRIBE/COMMENT\nhttp://www.pdm-tv.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/pdmansouri\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pdmcomedy\nhttp://www.twitter.com/pdm_comedy\nhttp://Instagram @PD_M\n\nFilmed By:\n\nWIDE UNIVERSE STUDIOS\nhttp://www.wideuniversestudios.com/\n\nsong: Nayla - (Gher Instrumental)\n\nTags:\npersian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm persian comedian iranian funny pd m pdm", "title": "Back Talking - Persian Edition", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T07:53:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1IjXevlSfL8", "description": "Mini-documentary about the Northern Cardinal.

Cuneta's acoustic rehash of the Rupert Holmes classic was well received by fans and critics.\nThe song is given a unique interpretation as the lyrics narrative were delivered from a female point of view, the line \"I had to get back to the kids and my wife\" was changed to \" I had to get back to the kids and my life\". The Philippine Daily Inquirer commends the Megastar for her \"unique ability to turn mush into musical magic - suddenly, \"Terminal\" is no longer the trite and soppy standard. And our heart goes out to the lonely career woman who is wistfully singing about finding romance at a bus terminal, and passing up on a love that might have been her escape from an empty, arid life. Such is the power of Cuneta's storytelling gift and emotive ability\".[3]\nBuoyed by \"Terminal\" and fifteen other pop classic remakes, \"Isn't It Romantic?\" has since achieved 10 x Platinum status and received a Diamond Record Award in recognition of its phenomenal sales.\n\n\nReleased:     2006\nRecorded:     2005\nGenre:            Pop, acoustic, easy listening\nLength:          04:28\nLabel:             Sony BMG Philippines\nWriter(s):        Rupert Holmes", "title": "Rupert Holmes - Terminal", "publishedDate": "2011-02-26T03:55:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "1J6zObXWkso", "description": "The brand new R27 from Ranger Tugs getting its first real test ride in Apalachicola by Marc of Wefing's Marine", "title": "Ranger Tug R27 in Apalachicola Bay", "publishedDate": "2010-08-26T12:29:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1J77kNBOtHk", "description": "Extrait du film \u00c9clipse  totale", "title": "Eclipse totale Rimbaud Verlaine", "publishedDate": "2010-03-11T16:14:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1J78zDHvQZs", "description": "Introducing the \"Teg Tab\" for easy tee rail and partition installation to suit tegular/rebated edge tiles.  \n\nFor more information visit www.lwsupply.com or connect with us on Facebook (www.facebook.com/lwsupply), Twitter (www.twitter.com/lwsupply) or LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/company/l&w-supply).", "title": "Teg Tab Product Demonstration Video", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T19:39:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "1J7UEidGOnw", "description": "FULL VIDEO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grJsOShDCMw\nBefore we kick off our full LP, get a sneak peak at the blood soaked comedy to come!", "title": "Two Best Friends Play Evil Within", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T19:07:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1J7eDSV1c7Y", "description": "WOW!

To get in front of your doctor for a thorough once over. But do you know what to expect from a physical?\n\n\"What I tell patients is you want to get a full head to toe exam,\" says Dr. Sal Lacagnina, vice president of Health & Wellness with Lee Memorial Health System. \n\nFirst doctors 'get into your head'- talking about any aches, pains or concerns you have. It's called a review of symptoms. Once that's finished, they'll take a look. \n\n\"The physician or nurse practitioner should be examining you in a gown so they can look at your skin and make sure they're listening and feeling every part of your body to make sure physically that you're healthy,\" says Dr. Lacagnina. \n\nThe basics include: blood pressure, heart rate, weight, temperature and respiration. Anyone one of these can trigger additional testing.\n\n\"So some of them are blood tests, some of them are procedures or other physical tests,\" says Dr. Lacagnina. \n\nA doctor should listen to your heart, lungs and abdomen, and look in your ears, eyes and nose. They can do a basic neurological exam and test your reflexes. Along with a skin cancer evaluation. Males and females have gender specific screenings. A new addition for some is a fitness exam.\n\n\"When most people get their wellness exams they are sitting down on an exam table, they're not doing anything physical.

Levine, Nan Morales, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher, Hilary Swank\nScreenwriter: Richard LaGravenese, Freedom Writers, Erin Gruwell\nFilm Description: Assigned the thankless task of teaching freshman English at a gang-infested Long Beach, CA high school, a 23-year-old teacher resorts to unconventional means of breaking through to her hardened students in director Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Erin Gruwell's best-seller The Freedom Writer's Diaries: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. Her students had been written off, and her chances of succeeding scoffed at, but Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) wasn't about to go down without a fight. Long Beach is a place where a new war is waged with each passing day, and when the hardened students who walk those dangerous hallways sense an outsider attempting to understand their plight, their cynical resentment threatens to keep a deadly cycle in motion. Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble. When the only chance for survival is to befriend the person who was once your mortal enemy, the world is opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.\n\n\"freedom writers\",\"freedom writers clip\",\"freedom writers part 1\",\"freedom writers trailer\",mario,\"richard lagravenese\",\"backpack videos\",drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"stacey sher\",\"danny devito\",\"michael shamberg\",\"nan morales\",\"daniel s levine\",\"hilary swank\",\"jordana glick-franzheim\",\"tracey durning\",\"accountability videos\",\"frustration videos\",\"improvement videos\",\"high school videos\",\"erin gruwell\",\"andre bryant\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++326847,/m/0mz73", "title": "Freedom Writers (8/9) Movie CLIP - You Are Not Failing (2007) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T04:30:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1JbXIr2qUMU", "description": "\u5927\u962a\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30cb\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3", "title": "Spining toe Hold", "publishedDate": "2010-02-11T11:43:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1Jbk45FZby4", "description": "Titusonic (info@TitusPlus.com) is a revolutionary new fastening system which assembles and fastens cabinets, drawers and other items in most wood based materials including particle board and Light Weight Panel (LWP).

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W.

But, however this may be, I felt the omission the more keenly, as I had, in expectation of the new catalogue, enriched the library of the Jaalam Athen~um with the old one then in my possessioll, by which means it has come about that m,~ children will be deprived of a neverwearying winter evenmg 5 amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distingnished roll. ihose harmless innocents had at least committed no - but I forbear, having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the saf&amp;amp;keeping of my private diary, intended for posthumous publication. I state this fact here, in order that certain nameless individuals, who are, perhaps, overinnch congratulating themselves on my silence, may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly b~censed posterity will apply to their memories. The careful reader will note, that, in the list which I have prepared, I have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature. I have ventured to do this, not only to encourage native ambition and genius, but also because I have never been able to perceive in what way distance (miless we suppose them at the end of a lever) could increase the weight of learned bodies. As far as I have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach America, I have discovered no generic difference between tl~e antipodal Fog~rnrn Japonicum and the F. A~ericanum snfficiently common in our own immediate neighborhood. Yet, with a becoming defe;rence to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel, I have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literarv and other associations with the rest. I ad~ here, also, an advertisement, which, that it may be the n~ore readily understood by those persons especially i~~terested therein, I have written in that curtailed a~~d otherwise nialtreated canine Latin, to the writing and reading of which they are accustomed.

I wasn't interested in working on an album at first. I was dealing with some legal issues from 2012 and kind of just needed some time to breathe once that was dealth with. Filthy Rich got at me in early 2013. He was ready to go. I was concentrating on my manuscript but I sent him a song to work on. Then another, and another. It was comin' out raw. I talked to G-Macc, Lynch, and C-Bo. They said they had my back. I told Rich, 'Fuck it, we're doing Psycho Active 2.' He was like, 'Hell yeah!'\n\n\"We did a bunch of solo tracks. RBC responded to the prospect positively. That pretty much did it. We got crackin'. It took about five months to finish the project. We got verses from the homies. Niggas came through for me. We did a track called Reason of the Siccness with Brotha Lynch Hung and C-Bo. The album has 15 tracks. 18 on the deluxe. 90% of them are solos.\n\n\"I got that siccness right now. These are the most savage, gangsta songs I've written since Psycho Active and Xorcist. 99.9% of the album is that wicked shit the fans have been asking for. This is that Everybody Killa, Witta Mask On shit. That Liquor, Niggas & Triggas shit. We killin' everybody.\n\n\"The album was mixed by Rob Rebeck at Champan out in KC. He's been working with Tech N9ne and Lynch. I feel like he's the best right now. I needed that. We got it mastered by Brian \"Big Bass\" Gardner at Bernie Grundman. He did Good Kid, Mad City for Kendrick. He's the best in the game hands down. The album's going to be crispy.\n\n\"We'll drop in the 1st quarter of 2014. Probably February or March depending on RBC and eOne's schedule. We'll drop a mixtape before the end of the year. I got Twisted Insane and C-Dubb and a few surprises on the mixtape so far. We're shooting videos too. This is the real deal. Shout out to Filthy Rich. Shout out to No Face.

Depo Provera (depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA) is a birth control shot that is administered every three months.  The FDA approved this drug in 1992 for sale on the market by Pfizer.  In recent years, the FDA has warned that this form of contraceptive had been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in a number of medical studies.  This risk of breast cancer may affect young women who have taken Depo Provera over a long period of time (one year or longer).  A 2012 study found that use of the drug for one year or longer more than doubled the risk of invasive breast cancer.  Each medical decision needs to be made on the specific facts of a patient's situation.  Additionally, drug manufacturers need to adequately warn patients about the risks of their products.  If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer after using Depo Provera, then you may want to talk to a lawyer about your rights.\n\nd'Oliveira & Associates has been looking into the safety of birth control drugs like Depo Provera and the law firm is ready to answer any questions you have about your legal options.  You may be able to recover for your hospital bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, or other related losses.

The native range of the eastern gray squirrel overlaps with that of the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel's range is slightly more to the west. The eastern gray squirrel is found from New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to East Texas and Florida.[1] There are breeding eastern gray squirrels in Nova Scotia, but it is not known if this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion.[3] It has also been introduced into Ireland,[4] Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973).[1]\nA prolific and adaptable species, the eastern gray squirrel has been introduced to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States. It has also been introduced to Britain, where it has spread across the country and has largely displaced the native red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris. In Ireland, the red squirrel has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country.[5] There are concerns that such displacement might happen in Italy and that gray squirrels might spread from Italy to other parts of mainland Europe.\n\nPlease click below to see Information About Brokerage Services.https://www.trec.state.tx.us/pdf/contracts/op-k.pdf\n\nEastern Gray Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis on Shoal Creek Trail in Austin TX\n\nWhen you select your REALTOR\u00ae, the right Live Work Downtown Austin Real Estate Expert and REALTOR\u00ae, like Perry Henderson and the Live Well Team, we're never too busy for you or your referrals.

I'm using the Doepfer logic module, clock divider and clock sequencer in concert with the 4ms rotating clock divider.\n\nI pick 6bars for the reset trigger because I plan on using the tension of a 3 against 2 rhythm as the foundation of the sequence and I don't want to interrupt the /3 stream with the reset.  Any reset at a number of bars divisible by 3 would work, I pick 6 rather than 3 because I want enough time between resets for the relationships between larger divisors to develop.\n\nWhen programming a trigger or sequence with this method, I use the Delptronics LDB as a sort of scratch pad.  It's pretty low sound quality, but it's cheap and produces easily recognizable sounds to hear the relationship between triggers.  The plan is to program higher quality voices for each trigger stream later.\n\nI've cheated a bit for this video by reconstructing a patch that I already made.

Most Vitamin B1 benefits come from foods in our diets. Foods rich in vitamin B1 benefit your body in many ways as highlighted in this video by Elated. Just one Elated Enlightenment Enhancer vegetable capsule contains 133% the daily amount of vitamin B1 recommended by the FDA. Elated Enlightenment Enhancer can be purchased here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3DZYIC\n\nElated is pleased to bring you this educational video about vitamin B1 by Jackson. Here is Jackson in his own words:\n\nI'm here today to talk to you about vitamin B1. Vitamin B1, which is also called thiamine, is essential for a healthy body, and can be found in high amounts in pork chops, pistachios, pecans, fish, beans, and many green vegetables. Now keep in mind that vitamin B1 is not stored in the body. Therefore it needs to be consistently replenished through either food or through supplementation.\n\nNow let's quickly talk about some benefits of vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is shown to improve brain function, help with digestion, convert carbohydrates into energy, help with heart disease, and when used in conjunction with omega 3's, it's been shown to promote eye health.\n\nI'll start with brain function. Vitamin B1 has been shown to improve brain function in terms of memory, concentration, as well as reducing mental stress. Vitamin B1 is so helpful with improving brain function that it's actually used to help treat and prevent Alzheimer disease.\n\nhttp://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107994740806386473876/107994740806386473876\n\nNow with regard to digestion, vitamin B1 has been shown to increase levels of acid in your stomach. Thereby helping your body to easily digest food and as a result it is often prescribed to people that have digestive problems.\n\nIn regards to fat loss, a really great benefit of vitamin B1 is that it helps your body convert carbohydrates into energy, as opposed to storing them as fat. Now the question becomes, how much vitamin B1 do we need in our diets? Recommended daily doses are 1.1 milligrams per day for women and 1.2 milligrams per day for men. Although vitamin B1 has been shown to be non-toxic even in very high doses.\n\nSo what this means is that, you really don't have to worry about consuming too much of it. And for the most part, as long as you eat a pretty healthy diet you're going to get a majority of your vitamin B1 from your food. If you supplement with it additionally, you're going to be okay. And I'm sure you'll probably get some benefits from it. But you don't need to worry about consuming too much vitamin B1.\n\nIf you would like conduct more research on Vitamin B-1 please visit http://www.getelated.com", "title": "Vitamin B1", "publishedDate": "2013-10-17T16:51:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1KRqE_qK3Ck", "description": "How will the Florida Legislature top last year's session.

Containers made of various materials are sealable. With small size, light weight, easy operation, it is suitable for low-volume production and operation in labs. The machine operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction: The aluminum foil on the bottle top is highly heated instantaneously and melted so that the bottle mouth is closely wrapped and sealed. The sealing is damp-proof, mould-proof, forgery-proof and theft-proof and prolongs goods storage time. The containers sealable can be made of PE, PP, PS, PET, ABS, glass, porcelain etc. but not metal. With Japan's latest modular power devices adopted, it is more economized in power and 20~30 times quicker in instantaneous heating than conventional vacuum tube-induced heaters, its heating efficiency being up to more than 90%.\nShipment:\nMost of our models are in stock, if not in stock, production time is 3-5 working days.\nSea shipment for large quantity. Door-to-door Express shipping is good for small quantity. We usually use DHL, TNT, EMS, Fedex for fast shipment with good shipping freight.\nFeatures of manual foil sealing equipment:\nFast and efficient. The foil seals tightly without being affected by moisture, grease or powder contamination on sealing area.\nThe detector checks the presence of foil.

It will also improve the general aeration of the plants and will make it easier to take advantage of sunlight and to undertake all of the care necessary with relation to crop production.\nIn order for the fruit to grow correctly, the implementation of phytoregulators is still the predominant choice although natural pollinators such as bees and bumblebees are being used more and more.\nThe courgette is a plant which requires high levels of moisture. This means that frequent watering will be necessary once the first fruits appear. However, if the ground becomes waterlogged, this will have an adverse effect.\nWith regard to feeding and nutrition, it would be recommendable to maintain the ratio of N\u2212P\u2212K to 2\u22121\u22122.5. It is also vitally important to plant nutrition to take into account that the plants will require an adequate supply of micro\u2212nutrients.\nThe main plagues seen to affect the courgette have been found to be whitefly, thrips, red spider-mite, aphids, leafminer and slugs. The most notable diseases are powdery mildew, grey rot and mildew.\nWith respect to virus infections, those which should be emphasized are; the zucchini yellow mosaic virus, the cucumber mosaic virus, the water melon mosaic virus and the cucumber vein yellowing virus.\nThe time period from the point of first fruit emergence to harvesting the crop will vary between 30 to 40 days. However if the plants are in the open air and subject to adverse climatic conditions, the aforementioned time may well be prolonged.\n\nMore information in www.infoagro.com/video", "title": "Courgette growing.

It is still in use in Montreal Dorval Airport and some inter-terminal transit at Washington Dulles. The system was part of the Washington Dulles terminal design by Eero Saarinen.[1]\n\nThe lounge is a 54-by-16-foot carriage mounted on a scissor truck, capable of carrying 102 passengers. These vehicles were designed by the Chrysler Corporation in association with the Budd Company, and are sometimes nicknamed \"moon buggies\" due to their otherworldly appearance. When mobile lounges were first introduced, they had ramps at one end that could be raised or lowered to the floor height of an aircraft. However, when they were retrofitted to be used only for inter-terminal passenger transport, the ramps were removed and doors that could interlock with a terminal building were fitted to either end. Mobile lounges have a driver's cab at each end. The wheels at either end of the lounge can be steered, but the wheels at the end opposite the driver lock into a straight-ahead configuration so that the lounge is steered only by the wheels at the leading end of the lounge.\n\nEero Saarinen promoted the mobile lounge concept with a short animated film by Charles and Ray Eames.[2] Dulles Airport was the realization of the concepts expressed in the film.\n\nThe plane mate is an evolutionary variation on the concept. They are similar in appearance to mobile lounges, but can raise themselves on screws (parts of which are contained in a pair of fin-like towers above the vehicles) to \"mate\" directly with an aircraft. This allows passengers to deplane directly aboard and be carried to the main terminal. They are easily identified by the different window configuration and two short columns on the roof with red beacons mounted on the top. Plane mates have an accordion-like canopy at one end (similar to the canopy seen at the end of a jet bridge) and have only one driver's cab and one set of steering wheels at the canopy end.\n\nWhen built, Dulles's designers thought that by shuttling from the main terminal directly to a midfield jet ramp, they could save passengers from long walking distances amidst weather, noise, and fumes on the ramp. The advent of the jet bridge and construction of the midfield concourses diluted the system's advantages.\n\nDulles is one of the few remaining airports to use the mobile lounge/plane mate system. On January 26, 2010, the MWAA replaced the mobile lounge system for passenger movements between the Main Terminal and the A, B, and C-Gates with the AeroTrain. However, some mobile lounges/plane mates remain in use for passenger movements to and from Concourse D, to disembark international passengers from all arriving international aircraft (minus United flights landing at Concourse C and flights from countries with border preclearance) and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, and to convey passengers to and from aircraft on hard standing (i.e., those parked remotely on the tarmac without access to jet bridges).[3]\n\nCrew Transport Vehicle (NASA)[edit]\n\nEarly in the space shuttle program, NASA used a plane mate system to move astronauts directly from the orbiter to crew facilities. A modified vehicle obtained from the Baltimore airport was used for shuttle landings at Edwards Air Force Base.

One of the Indian sects called Naga Sadhus made nudity a part of their spiritual practice, but naga have been misunderstood as \"nagna\".\n\nNaga means \"who represents Power\". The word Naga had came from NAG (snake) which signifies power in Hindu philosophy. And the word sadhu had came from Sadhan (Spiritual Practice). Members of the sect considered nudity a way of rejecting the material side of life. Celibacy and disregard of the harsh outside conditions were among the key ideas of their philosophy. They practiced naked yoga to tame their desires, identify with their physical bodies and to break the attachment with everything physical, sensual and material.\n\nThe word \"gymnosophists\" (naked philosophers), is used in ancient Greek writings as the designation of wise men (yogis) in India, maybe the naga sadhus.\n\nModern naked yoga has some roots in Germany and Switzerland through a movement called Lebensreform. The movement had since the end of the 19th century highlighted yoga and nudity.[1] In the early 20th century, the term gymnosophy was appropriated by several groups who practiced nudity, asceticism and meditation.\n\nIn the West since the 1960s, naked yoga practice has been incorporated in the hippie movement[2] and for instance in progressive settings for well-being, such as at the Esalen Institute in California, as depicted in the 1968 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. Other films with notable segments include The Harrad Experiment and Naked Yoga (1974).\n\nActress Lena Nyman practice yoga exercises naked in a movie, I Am Curious (Yellow), from 1967. Organized naked yoga existed after mid eighties mainly among naturists, particularly in Central Europe.\n\nIn New York City in 1998, an American going by the name Jayadev started a group called \"Midnight Yoga for Men\" where participants practiced \"naked before the infinite\" in the style of the sadhus.\n\nAnother person famous for the promotion of naked yoga in the West is Aaron Star, owner of Hot Nude Yoga. He began his version of nude yoga in April 2001 becoming an instant \"underground sensation\" as quoted by Time Out New York. The practiced yoga combined elements of Ashtanga, Kundalini, and Contact Yoga with elements of Tantra.[3] Because of the success of Hot Nude Yoga, nude yoga groups began to blossom all over the world, from London, Moscow, Madrid to Sydney. Many of these male-only naked yoga groups have been associated with the gay community,[4] though often not intentionally. One Taste Urban Retreat Center popularized naked yoga after it was reported in the San Francisco Chronicle.[5] Nowadays, there are also specific naked yoga clubs for homosexuals that are not simple yoga classes, but rather communities for keeping fit and sharing sexuality.[6] Aaron Star says that many people, especially in cities like New York and Los Angeles, don't have ways to express closeness and intimacy without having sex, and that his practice affords that.[7]\n\nIn 2013 Lady Gaga, who worked with bikram yoga for several years, has attracted some attention through a film,The Abramovi\u0107 Method practiced by Lady Gaga.[8] The film has been understood by media as \"naked yoga\", and is primarily inspired by performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107", "title": "Learn English Vocabulary   Verbs Part 2 1 English Conversation", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T09:19:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1L4KsgnCBeA", "description": "Definition of etymology", "title": "LANGUAGE & LINGUISTICS:  ETYMOLOGY DEFINITION", "publishedDate": "2013-05-27T12:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1L4iH89tjAM", "description": "DIRECTED AND PRODUCED, CAMERA AND EDITED BY DANH VAN LE AKA DIGITAL DAN.

I'm talking about girlfriends, boyfriends or even a spouse. We all want love and it's so frustrating when we're alone by ourselves especially during Valentine's day or Christmas. \n\nSeeing couples enjoying themselves further increases the pain. Here is how law of attraction can help you to attract a relationship.\n\nThe law of attraction requires 3 things in order for it to work:\n\n- Believe without a doubt that your desire will manifest\n- Giving off positive vibrations all day\n- Acting as though you already have what you desire\n\nBased on these 3 rules you can use the law of attraction to attract a relationship. Here are 5 steps which you can follow:\n\n1. When you wake up, think about your ideal boyfriend or girlfriend. If there is someone who you've got a crush on, think about that person. Now paint a picture in your mind that they are smiling at you and holding your hand. See them actually enjoy spending time with you.\n\nWhen you picture this in your mind, feel it actually happening now. You should be acting out this dream and believe it's happening this instance. This should get you off to a good start in the morning.\n\n2. When you go out of the house or on the bus to work, expect to see your ideal partner. Imagine meeting them on the way to work or when you go shopping. Say to yourself that you have a strong hunch you'll meet them today.\n\n3. In restaurants or in social gatherings, expect to see your partner there. Get ready for what to say when you meet them. All this time, imagine that they would be very happy to see you. See the both of you laughing and lightly touching each others' arms and shoulders in a friendly manner.\n\n4. Act as though you are already going out with the person. You can do this when you go to the cinema, shopping or waiting in a queue. Live out your desire now. Imagine you are sitting next to them. Talking to them and sharing jokes. Remember, the emotion you feel when you act out this desire should be very strong. You should be very happy and actually make yourself believe it's already happening.\n\n5. Create the opportunity to actually go and see the person. When you meet them, you should feel as though you're already lovers. Talk to them and at all times treat them like you would your lover (without the intimate touches of course).\n\nWhat you are doing is basically applying the law of attraction strongly to attract your relationship. By doing the above 5 steps you are meeting all the 3 rules which require the law of attraction to work. Remember that belief and your emotions are very important. You can tell if you're doing the right thing by noticing the mood you're in. If you're genuinely happy, then you're applying the law of attraction correctly.\n\nUsing this Universal Law not only requires practice, it requires a change in your lifestyle as it is not normal for humans to be consistently positive. You can get more information below on this topic. What you need to do now is to understand why your desires haven't manifested yet and then take the appropriate actions and properly apply the law of attraction.\n\nDownload the book \"How To Implement The Law Of Attraction\" at http://www.eliteselfhelp.com/loa\n\nFor more self help information download a free report on how to get wealth and success within 14 days at http://www.selfhelpkingdom.com", "title": "Law of Attraction - How To Attract A Relationship", "publishedDate": "2010-11-08T08:03:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1L5XAuZxx2o", "description": "Para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n vis\u00edtanos en:\nhttp://www.nohaydolor.com\n\nLESI\u00d3N\n\nEl periostio es la envoltura externa del hueso. En la tibia, hueso anterior de la pierna, hay un amplio periostio en el que se inserta el m\u00fasculo tibial anterior que da la forma redondeada a la zona anterior y externa de la pierna.\nEl m\u00fasculo tibial anterior realiza un importante trabajo en la carrera. Cuando se hace un entrenamiento de carrera muy intenso, muy prolongado o en condiciones desfavorables (como sucede en la carrera en cuesta o en situaci\u00f3n de fatiga), la tracci\u00f3n repetida que el m\u00fasculo tibial anterior realiza sobre el periostio de la tibia puede provocar una inflamaci\u00f3n del periostio tibial (periostitis), que provoca un dolor muy importante en amplias zonas tibiales que dificultan la carrera, incluso, obligan a detener la actividad deportiva. La palpaci\u00f3n de la espina tibial, adem\u00e1s de dolor, puede mostrar hinchaz\u00f3n de la zona.\n\nPREVENCI\u00d3N \n\nLa prevenci\u00f3n de la periostitis requiere una actuaci\u00f3n a diversos niveles. Algunas alteraciones anat\u00f3micas como diferente longitud de las extremidades inferiores, rotaci\u00f3n interna de la cadera e hiperpronaci\u00f3n del tobillo predisponen a padecer esta lesi\u00f3n y requieren una correcci\u00f3n ortop\u00e9dica mediante plantillas. Algunas veces, el origen del problema, se encuentra en cambios en el calzado deportivo. Algunos aspectos del entrenamiento tambi\u00e9n tienen una gran importancia en la aparici\u00f3n de la lesi\u00f3n, como el entrenamiento en cuesta, el volumen excesivo de entrenamiento, el descanso escaso y la mala t\u00e9cnica de carrera.\n\nTRATAMIENTO \n\nYa se ha comentado que es muy importante realizar las medidas de prevenci\u00f3n para que el tratamiento sea efectivo. El tratamiento, en la fase aguda, precisa reposo relativo de la zona. Si el proceso es muy doloroso puede ser necesario reposo deportivo unos d\u00edas. Se aplicar\u00e1 fr\u00edo despu\u00e9s de la actividad deportiva. Se debe realizar estiramiento de la musculatura tibial. En la fase inicial, es \u00fatil la medicaci\u00f3n antiinflamatoria por v\u00eda oral y tambi\u00e9n se puede utilizar de forma t\u00f3pica.\n\nCuando se reinicia la actividad es recomendable la utilizaci\u00f3n de vendaje funcional de la zona tibial mediante tiras de esparadrapo que sujeten con firmeza dos o tres niveles tibiales.\n\nPuedes ver mas detalles en:\nwww.nohaydolor.com\n\nALMIRALL \nwww.almirall.com", "title": "PERIOSTITIS TIBIAL (\u00c1MBITO DEL DEPORTE) - www.nohaydolor.com - ALMIRALL", "publishedDate": "2010-06-09T12:01:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1L5asJF5jQ8", "description": "The tears started flowing before half time, and by the end of a 7-1 shellacking in the World Cup semifinal, millions across Brazil were in dazed, damp-eyed disbelief.

The difference between leading and lagging strand replication is also addressed. \n\nLyrics:\nDNA's structure, with its bases complementary ,\nMakes replication easy, but not quite elementary\nSince A only bonds with T and C  with G,\nThe double helix seems to copy naturally,\n\nor as Crick and Watson said: (PAUSE BEAT)\n\nCHORUS\n\"It has not escaped our notice \nthat that the specific pairing \nwe have postulated \nimmediately suggests \nA possible copying mechanism \nfor the genetic material.\"\n\nYou first unzip the DNA in one or more places,\nBreaking hydrogen bonds to separate the bases.\nEach resulting single strand serves as a template,\nAllowing enzymes to replicate\n\nNew strands with complementary bases that match\nAnd through hydrogen bonds these bases attach\nEach nucleotide now bonds to the next\nThrough a sugar-phosphate bond they connect\n\nMeselsohn and Stahl proved in '58\nThat this is how the double helix replicates\nOne strand new, the parent strand preserved,\nIn other words the whole thing is semi-conserved,\n\nCHORUS\n \nNow let's see how replication really goes,\nWith blind, mindless enzymes controlling the show.\nMade more complex by something you can see\nEach DNA strand has directionality\n\n5 prime to 3 is how the enzymes go,\n(Just refer to the carbons in deoxyribose)\nSo when a new strand is synthesized\nNucleotides get added on the 3 prime side\n\nThe process begins with helicase,\nWhich opens up the helix at a special place\nBreaking hydrogen bonds at the origin,\nA sequence telling helicase where to begin\n\nA replication fork is now composed,\nWhere both parent strands have their bases exposed\nAnd to keep the double helix from rewinding,\nSingle strand proteins come in and start binding.\n\nNote two forks always form when DNA doubles,\nThe whole thing's called a replication bubble\nNow it's primase's turn, the next enzyme\nTo come to the origin at this time\n\nPrimase lays down a primer of RNA,\nComplementary to the template DNA.\nSetting the stage for the star of our show\nDNA polymerase, now set to go.\n\nDNA polymerase's job is to add \nDeoxyribonucleotides to a growing strand.\nBut polymerase needs a growing strand in place,\nWhich is why initiation is the job of primase.\n\nWhat happens now is simple, it's a replication race,\nAs polymerase follows helicase,\nAs the fork opens up, replication proceeds, \nWith nucleotides added at incredible speed.\n\nCHORUS\n\nWhat we've said applies to the leading strand\nWhere replication's smooth, continuous and grand,\nBut on the second strand, fork opens 3 to 5:\na direction where polymerase can't polymerize\n\nSo instead of following helicase,\nPolymerase moves away from the forking place\nSo replication's lagging, and fragmentary\nAs discovered in '66 by Okazaki\n\nSo the lagging DNA's filled with Okazaki fragments,\nAnd RNA primers, and to clean up this mess,\nPolymerase 1 removes the primer,\nPuts deoxyribonucleotides in what could be finer?\n\nAnd now the fragments need to be connected,\nSo the new DNA can be perfected,\nLigase carries out this function with pride,\nSealing sugar-phosphate bonds between nucleotides\n\nCHORUS", "title": "DNA Replication Rap", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T20:22:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "1L8ZJqkX5nc", "description": "Music for the short film Carolina Parakeet.
