Researchers at Launceston General Hospital and the University of Tasmania in Australia treatment of gestational diabetes, studied patients with gestational diabetes treated with metformin , to determine whether it might be possible to predict which patients should be started on this oral diabetes medications and that pregnant women should be given injectable insulin at the time of diagnosis.\n\nTwenty-five women with gestational diabetes were included in the study ...\n\n    16 or 64 percent , were normal blood sugar levels, while being treated with metformin reach.\n    9 women , or 36 percent , had to switch to insulin.\n    7 were able to achieve normal blood sugar levels while taking metformin and\n    2 were intolerant of the drug treatment of gestational diabetes.\n\nIt was found that women who did also on metformin had higher blood glucose levels at diagnosis than those patients who require insulin . Ninety- three percent of participants successfully treated with fasting levels of 93.7 mg / dL ( 5.2 mmol / L ) were treated with metformin, while only 33 percent of those with fasting levels above 93.7 mg / dL (5.2 mmol / L) achieved good blood glucose control to the drug.\n\nFrom this information it was concluded prenatal clinics to determine which women should be treated with metformin and insulin, treatment of gestational diabetes which will require , by determining the blood sugar levels.\n\nFrom the perspective of the fetus , a study showed metformin to be completely safe , while a later study has demonstrated its safety in question . Back in 2008, The New England Journal of Medicine reported the results of a study comparing children born to mothers taking metformin born to those whose mothers treated with insulin.

Phillips\n\nScreenwriter: Gene Roddenberry, Harve Bennett, Jack B. Sowards, Nicholas Meyer, Samuel A. Peeples\n\nFilm Description: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a 1982 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. The film is the second feature based on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. The plot features James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise facing off against the genetically-engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n), a character who first appeared in the 1967 Star Trek television series episode \"Space Seed\". When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a powerful terraforming device named Genesis. The film concludes with the death of Enterprise crewmember Spock (Leonard Nimoy), beginning a story arc that continues through 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.\nAfter the lackluster critical and commercial response to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and the theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy only reprised his role as Spock because the character's death was intended to be irrevocable. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniatures from past projects and re-using effects footage and costumes from the previous movie. Among the film's technical achievements is the first complete feature film sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics.\nThe Wrath of Khan was released in North America on June 4, 1982. It was a box office success, earning US$97\u00a0million worldwide and setting a world record for first-day box office gross. Critical reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan, the film's pacing and the character interactions as strong elements. Negative reaction focused on weak special effects and some of the acting. The Wrath of Khan is generally considered one of the best films of the Star Trek series and is credited with creating renewed interest in the franchise.\n\nPlot: The film opens with the Vulcan Lieutenant Saavik in command of the starship USS Enterprise. The vessel is on a rescue mission to save the crew of a damaged ship in the Neutral Zone along the border with Klingon space when it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged. The \"attack\" is revealed to be a training exercise known as the \"Kobayashi Maru\"; a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers. Admiral James T. Kirk oversees the simulator session of Captain Spock's trainees.\nThe USS Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet for testing of the Genesis Device, a torpedo that reorganizes matter to create habitable worlds for colonization. Reliant officers Commander Pavel Chekov and Captain Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a possible candidate planet, Ceti Alpha VI, where they are captured by genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh. The Enterprise discovered Khan's ship adrift in space fifteen years previously; Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen from 20th century Earth to Ceti Alpha V. Khan reveals that after they were marooned, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, destroying Ceti Alpha V's ecosystem and shifting its orbit. Khan blames Kirk for the death of his wife and plans to avenge her. He implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous, mind-controlling eels that enter the ears of their victims and uses the officers to gain control of the Reliant. Learning of the existence of Genesis, Khan attacks Space Station Regula I where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David.\nThe Enterprise embarks on a training voyage under the command of Spock.

It grows wild in many of the tropical and temperate areas of the world. It can be grown in almost any climate, and is increasingly cultivated by means of indoor hydroponic technology.\n\nThe main active ingredient in cannabis is called delta-9 tetrahydro-cannabinol, commonly known as THC. This is the part of the plant that gives the \"high.\" There is a wide range of THC potency between cannabis products.\n\nCannabis is used in three main forms: marijuana, hashish and hash oil. Marijuana is made from dried flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant. It is the least potent of all the cannabis products and is usually smoked. Hashish is made from the resin (a secreted gum) of the cannabis plant. It is dried and pressed into small blocks and smoked. It can also be added to food and eaten. Hash oil, the most potent cannabis product, is a thick oil obtained from hashish. It is also smoked.\n\nCannabis is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (known as \"joints\") or in special waterpipes (\"bongs\"). These pipes or bongs can be bought or made from things such as orange juice containers, soft drink cans or even toilet rolls.\n\nHow many people use cannabis?\n\nCannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in Australia. According to the 2007 National Drug Household Survey, 33.5% of the Australian population reported using cannabis at some time, with 9.1% having used it in the last 12 months. More than 600,000 Australians used cannabis in the previous week.\n\n    20% of 14-19 year olds reported ever using cannabis;\n    49.5% of 20-29 year olds reported ever using the drug.\n\nThe average age at first use was 18.8 years.\n\nThe proportion of secondary school students reporting using cannabis has decreased in recent years. However, the 2008 Secondary School Survey still found that cannabis was the most commonly used illicit substance by this group, with 14% of all secondary school students aged between 12 and 17 years reporting using the drug at some time in their life.\n\nCannabis use increased with age from 3% of 12-year-olds who had ever used cannabis to 26% of 17-year-olds.\n\n    28% of 17 year old males reported ever using cannabis;\n    24% of 17 year old females reported ever using cannabis;\n    4% of 12 year old males reported ever using cannabis;\n    2% of 12 year old females reported ever using cannabis.\n\nOther names for cannabis\n\nCannabis is also known as marijuana, grass, pot, dope, Mary Jane, hooch, weed, hash, joints, brew, reefers, cones, smoke, mull, buddha, ganga, hydro, yarndi, heads and green.\n\nWhy do people use cannabis?\n\nMost people who use cannabis do so to experience a sense of mild euphoria and relaxation, often referred to as a 'high'. Cannabis causes changes in the user's mood and also affects how they think and perceive the environment, e.g. everyday activities such as watching the television and listening to music can become altered and more intense.\n\nWhat are the short-term effects of cannabis?\n\nThe short-term effects of using cannabis may include:\n\n    Feeling of well-being;\n    Talkativeness;\n    Drowsiness;\n    Loss of inhibitions;\n    Decreased nausea;\n    Increased appetite;\n    Loss of co-ordination;\n    Bloodshot eyes;\n    Dryness of the eyes, mouth, and throat;\n    Anxiety and paranoia.\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of cannabis?\n\nThere is limited research on the long-term effects of cannabis. On the available evidence, the major probable adverse effects are:\n\n    Increased risk of respiratory diseases associated with smoking, including cancer;\n    Decreased memory and learning abilities;\n    Decreased motivation in areas such as study, work or concentration.\n\nThere is also much concern about the link between cannabis use and mental health problems and the risk of dependence.

Randall Niles examines surviving standards of ethics and morality, relatively speaking. \n\nWhat is ethical relativism? Relativism is the position that all points of view are equally valid and the individual determines what is true and relative for them. Relativism theorizes that truth is different for different people, not simply that different people believe different things to be true. While there are relativists in science and mathematics, ethical relativism is the most common variety of relativism. Almost everyone has heard a relativist slogan: \n\nWhats right for you may not be whats right for me.\n\nWhats right for my culture wont necessarily be whats right for your culture.\n\nNo moral principles are true for all people at all times and in all places.\n\nEthical relativism represents the position that there are no moral absolutes, no moral right or wrong. This position would assert that our morals evolve and change with social norms over a period of time. This philosophy allows people to mutate ethically as the culture, knowledge, and technology change in society. Slavery is a good example of ethical relativism. Repeatedly the value of a human being is determined by a combination of social preferences and patterns, experience, emotions, and rules that seemed to bring about the most benefit. \n\nWhat is ethical relativism from a subjective view? Subjective ethical relativism supports the view that the truth of moral principles is relative to individuals. Whatever you believe is right for you personally is completely up to you to determine. Subjective relativism allows you to be sovereign over the principles that dictate how you live your life. \n\nConventional ethical relativism supports the view that the truth of moral principles is relative to cultures. Unlike the subjective view, what is right for you as an individual is dependant upon what your particular culture believes is right for you. This view supports the concept that whatever culture says is right for you really is right for you.

It is thought to be ancestral to the domestic chicken, with some hybridzation with the Grey Junglefowl. The Red Junglefowl was first domesticated at least five thousand years ago in Asia, then taken around the world, and the domestic form is kept globally as a very productive food source of both meat and eggs.The range of the wild form stretches from Tamil Nadu, South India (where it has almost certainly been diluted with cross breeding from domestic breeds) eastwards across southern China and into Malaysia, the Philippines (where it is locally known as labuyo) and Indonesia. Junglefowl are established on several of the Hawaiian Islands, but these are feral descendants of domestic chickens. They can also be found on Christmas Island and the Marianas.\n\nThe Sundarban National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve in India. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta of India and Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a National Park.\n\nSundarbans National Park is located in between 21\u00b0 32' - 21\u00b0 55' N latitude and between 88\u00b0 42' - 89\u00b0 04' E longitude in West Bengal in India. The average altitude of the park is 7.5 m above sea level. The park is made up of 54 small islands and is crisscrossed by several tributaries of the Ganges.\n\nSundarbans National Park is the largest estuarine mangrove forest in the world.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A sword in the most narrow sense consists of a straight blade with two edges and a hilt. However, in nearly every case, the term may also be used to refer to weapons with a single edge (backsword).\n\nThe word sword comes from the Old English sweord, cognate to swert, Old Norse sver\u00f0, from a Proto-Indo-European root *swer- \"to wound, to cut\". Non-European weapons called \"sword\" include single-edged weapons such as the Middle Eastern saif, the Chinese dao and the related Japanese katana. The Chinese jian is an example of a non-European double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-edged Iron Age sword.\n\nHistorically, the sword developed in the Bronze Age, evolving from the dagger; the earliest specimens date to ca. 1600 BC. The Iron Age sword remained fairly short and without a crossguard. The spatha as it developed in the Late Roman army became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at first adopted as the Migration period sword, and only in the High Middle Ages developed into the classical arming sword with crossguard.\n\nThe use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or (in an early modern or modern context) as fencing. In the Early Modern period, the sword developed into the rapier and eventually the smallsword, surviving into the 18th century only in the role of duelling weapon. By the 19th century, swords were reduced to the status of either ceremonial weapon or sport equipment in modern fencing.\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c\u044e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "title": "Swords arts and sword", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T21:45:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "5rVltYbigxU", "description": "Yo soy Argentino...vos sos boliviano....che Belgrano puto...vivis pagando asados....digan lo que digan...talleres es mi vida....amo los colores...no la categor\u00eda...yo soy asi....soy matador.....vos sos asi....sos un cag\u00f3n....tu \u00fanica alegr\u00eda una promoci\u00f3n  !!!!", "title": "TALLERES 3 VILLA SAN CARLOS 2..YO SOY ARGENTINO,VOS SOS BOLIVIANO......", "publishedDate": "2014-06-07T17:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "5rWHfV36VTE", "description": "FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/pire.mastaa\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/piremastaa\n\nPIRE MASTAA FREESTYLE CHALET TUNISIE n\u00b01: SOLF\u00c9RINO\nProd Pire Mastaa\n\nBient\u00f4t du nouveau, la visite du secteur continue...", "title": "PIRE MASTAA FREESTYLE CHALET TUNISIE n\u00b01: SOLF\u00c9RINO Prod.

It creates a, pressurized environment and releases pure oxygen. Super-saturating the body with oxygen helps accelerate wound healing. The same technology can cleanse the body of carbon monoxide in the event of a poisoning.\n\nLee Memorial Hospital is one of only a handful of centers in the state of Florida that still offers emergency hyperbaric services.\n\nOn the cusp of hurricane season, more attention is paid to improper use of generators. \n\nUsed outside to provide power, they are perfectly fine. But used indoors, they create a potential for disaster. \n\n\"People do not realize the affect of carbon monoxide poisoning,\" says Capt. John Manson with the N. Ft. Myers Fire Dept. \"They say it's the silent killer because you don't smell it or anything.\"\n\nRescue crews are well acquainted with the dangers. After Hurricane Charley in 2004, the hyperbaric unit treated a record number of poisonings.\n\n\"We had a lot of carbon monoxide poisoning, a lot of people put generators on the soffit and therefore the carbon monoxide rose through the soffit and into the house,\" says Dr. Robert Casola.\n\n \"We treated over 35 people in two days.\"\n\nThe multiplace chamber is built to treat several people at once. A feature that proved lifesaving.\n\n\"During hurricane Charlie, we had families of six and seven,\" Dr. Casola says.\n\nView More Health Matters video segments at www.leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n\nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

This is a good indicator of hail damage that should be reported and further evaluated. We believe there is enough impact damage that it may be possible for this homeowner to report to their insurance company and file a claim for a new roof.\n\nWe also observed damage to several of the neoprene seals at the roof level plumbing stack flashing details and lifting apron flashing details at the roof level chimney structure that are leaking water into the attic area and has caused water stains and the ceiling finish in various locations throughout the house.\n\nWe observed that the outer lens of the skylight had two cracks in it and is leaking water into the interior of the attic area and causing water stains on the interior ceiling finishes.\n\nThe roofing material had cracks in various locations and discoloration that would indicate that the roofing material is starting to show its age and may be nearing the end of its serviceable life expectancy and should be further evaluated by a qualified roofing contractor.\n\nThis is a good example by someone should choose a professional home inspection company to perform a thorough and detailed home inspection for them.\n\nA-Action Home Inspection Group is a family-owned and operated business.

Check it now also discover A Face like Thunder\nHello. Welcome\nDo you want to learn English with a native speaker?...\n\nI am sure you do! Many more videos will be uploaded to help you improve your English.\nShot and edited by Brian a BBC producer and director and English writer.

Some linguists (such as David Graddol) believe that it is no longer the exclusive cultural property of \"native English speakers\", but is rather a language that is absorbing aspects of cultures worldwide as it continues to grow.[15] It is, by international treaty, the official language for aerial and maritime communications.[55] English is an official language of the United Nations and many other international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee.\nEnglish is the language most often studied as a foreign language in the European Union (by 89% of schoolchildren), followed by French (32%), German (18%), Spanish (8%), and Russian; while the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages amongst Europeans is 68% English, 25% French, 22% German, and 16% Spanish.[56] Among non-English speaking EU countries, a large percentage of the population claimed to have been able to converse in English (note that the percentages are for the adult population, aged 15 and above): in Sweden (85%), Denmark (83%), the Netherlands (79%), Luxembourg (66%), Finland (60%), Slovenia (56%), Austria (53%), Belgium (52%), and Germany (51%).[57]\nBooks, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world. English is also the most commonly used language in the sciences.[15] In 1997, the Science Citation Index reported that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.\nBecause the English language has become the new global lingua franca and has sometimes had a large impact on other languages, it has been said to have an influence on language shift and even language death to other languages as they are \"not effectively being passed on to the next generation\" (Crystal, 2000)[58]. Hence, linguists gave rise to the term \"English Language Imperialism\" [59]. Regardless of some of its effects on other languages, the English language in itself has been the victim of language shift, especially during the Norman conquest of England. Even today, the Englishes around the world are constantly influenced by their regional counterparts.[59] For this reason, the 'English language is forever evolving' \nA version of the language almost universally agreed upon by educated English speakers around the world is called formal written English. It takes virtually the same form regardless of where it is written, in contrast to spoken English, which differs significantly between dialects, accents, and varieties of slang and of colloquial and regional expressions. Local variations in the formal written version of the language are quite limited, being restricted largely to the spelling differences between British and American English, along with a few minor differences in grammar and lexis.\nsince around the ninth century, English has been written in the Latin alphabet, which replaced Anglo-Saxon runes. The spelling system, or orthography, is multilayered, with elements of French, Latin and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system; it has grown to vary significantly from thephonology of the language. The spelling of words often diverges considerably from how they are spoken.Basic English is simplified for easy international use. Manufacturers and other international businesses tend to write manuals and communicate in Basic English. Some English schools in Asia teach it as a practical subset of English for use by beginners.\n\nAccent as a second language english comments english comprehension english courses onlineenglish course english department english ed english education funny english lesson funny english videos how to learn English how to speak English learn english with youtube cursos de ingles online estudar ingles online cours d'anglais en ligne apprenez anglais en ligne BBC Learn English idioms language englis british", "title": "Learn English Idioms: are you All Mouth and Trousers.

To create her work A Possibility of an Abstraction, Circle Dance that she presents at Le Mouvement, the 12th Swiss Sculpture Exhibition in Biel/Bienne in Switzerland, she worked with dervishes. The ecstatic circle dance is a means of falling into religious ecstasy and making contact with the universe. Usually, the dervishes wear their traditional clothes and hats. In Germaine Kruip's piece, they just wear simple dark trousers and white shirts. Performed on the station square in Biel/Bienne, the performance could be seen as a kind of protest, or just a show of one of the many street artists in the city.\n\nGermaine Kruipp: A Possibility of an Abstraction, Circle Dance.

And what is the meaning of their strange tattoos? In 1948, in the Altai Mountains of Siberia, four corpses were discovered within the permafrost. Sub-zero temperatures had preserved the bodies but turned their skin black. Using carbon dating, researchers determined these natural mummies are over 3000 years old -- men and women of a bronze age tribe known as the Scythians. Though little is known about the Scythians, many Russians idolize them. In popular culture, they are portrayed as freedom-loving riders of the steppes. Some believe they were the first Russians, a \"pure\" race of noble warriors. Recently, infrared light shone on their blackened skin revealed strange tattoos. What do these tattoos tell us about the true identity of the Scythians?\n\nWatch this webisode and find more short videos at http://www.museumsecrets.tv narrated by Colm Feore.\n \nMuseum Secrets is a hit TV series and rich media website that travels to the world's extraordinary museums, revealing the stories of irreplaceable treasures, probing familiar legends and assumptions, and using cutting edge research and technology to investigate the unknown.

By profession, Rick is a Tool & Die Maker and was nicknamed \"Tools\" many years ago by his friends in the industry. Throughout his career and in the field of aviation, safety has always been his highest priority. After hundreds of hours of flying experience, Rick invented a convenient way of carrying fresh batteries to make them easily accessible for pilots in the cockpit.\n\n\n\nThe caddies were first molded in glow material for pilots, understanding the need to access batteries in an emergency (lights out situation). We then added colors and more caddy versions, realizing the safety and convenience of the caddies would be welcomed by everyone. This is how PowerPax started and today we have 10 versions and many color options.\n\n\n\n\nBatteries are part of everyone's life. With our caddies you can organize, store, protect and carry. We believe in the near future these dispensers will become the universal standard for handling your batteries.\n\nhttp://www.weekendhandyman.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/theweekendhandyman\nhttp://www.facebook.com/weekendhandymanpage", "title": "StorACell Battery Organizer: By Ken Day of the Weekend Handyman", "publishedDate": "2014-07-10T18:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5suFzGscPck", "description": "Here we have a short HD video showing the jaw motions of the elongate tigerfish (Hydrocynus forskahlii). This specimen was collected from Lake Nasser, Egypt in January 2011. Current research in my lab at American University in Cairo is investigating the functional morphology of the elongate tigerfish's bite mechanics. Tigerfishes are endemic to Africa's rivers and lakes. They are also members of the Order Characiformes and as such are related to the piranhas, pacus, and vampirefishes of South America. What's notable about tigerfishes is that unlike their south american relatives that have immobile upper jaws, the tigerfish upper jaw goes through a substantial dorsal rotation (approx. 30 degrees). This rotation in combination with extensive lower jaw depression gives the tigerfish a large gape that also acts to point their razor sharp teeth in a forward orientation which presumably helps them to impale their prey during a rapid ram strike. Also, note how as the jaw closes the teeth interdigitate into semi-enclosed sockets on the opposing jaw. This interlocking beartrap-like bite enables them to chomp small fish prey into pieces and even cut chunks of flesh out of larger prey. If you want to learn more, this species is highlighted in the National Geographic Channel's Hooked: Lake Monsters (in the U.S.) & Hooked: Nile Giant (Internationally).", "title": "Tigerfish Jaw Kinetics by Justin Grubich", "publishedDate": "2011-02-15T19:56:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5suM0lOMxW8", "description": "\u25baFeel free to leave a LIKE and a COMMENT\u25c4\n\u25baSUBSCRIBE to see more video's\u25c4 http://www.youtube.com/user/TheColtProject?sub_confirmatio&sub_confirmatio&sub_confirmation=1\n\u25baCheap Games\u25ba https://www.g2a.com/r/thecoltproject\nG2A is a charity site run by PewDiePie. 100% safe and legit.\n\n\u266b\u266b=Cipher by Kevin MacLeod=\u266b\u266b\n\u263a=Picture's by TheColtProject=\u263a\n\n\u25baMy Tiwtter\u25ba http://twitter.com/@Colt_Official\n\n\u25baMy Facebook\u25ba http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Colt-Project/394112817395845\n\n\u25baMy Google+\u25ba http://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113854765348784686305/113854765348784686305\n\n\u25baRemember To Subscribe To My Channel\u25c4 http://www.youtube.com/user/TheColtProject?sub_confirmatio&sub_confirmatio&sub_confirmation=1", "title": "Machinist's Workbench: :Tutorial: :Thermal Expansion", "publishedDate": "2014-05-15T09:25:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5suRUIzM37E", "description": "Picando toras de pinus com o picador de madeira PTML 240/320x600 Plus.

It is the way you provide your family details to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) when they are considering whether or not you should be allowed to immigrate. CIC wants to know about your family so they can establish if you or one of your family members is \"inadmissible\" to Canada. You can be inadmissible to Canada for financial, health or security reasons or for past violations of Canada's immigration rules and regulations.

Pasalnya, kata Ramadhan, PDI Perjuangan dulunya justru menjadi partai yang paling keras menolak kenaikan BBM yang akan dilakukan pemerintah.\n\n\"Kalau kata orang Myanmar, Buddha, orang itu harus ingat karma. Nah, parpol juga gitu. Dulu saat oposisi, mereka asal njeplak (menolak kenaikan BBM), jadinya ini mereka jiper sama tuntutan rakyat,\" kata Ramadhan melalui pesan singkat, Rabu (27/8/2014) siang.\n\nRamadhan mengatakan, Presiden SBY saat itu menaikkan harga BBM tak lain karena didasari oleh kepentingan masyarakat. Keputusan itu diambil bukan atas kehendak partai atau pihak luar yang mendukung ataupun menentang.\n\n\"SBY nggak pernah naikkan atau turunkan harga BBM karena tekanan politik parpol. Kebijakan Pak SBY solid dan konsisten untuk rakyat. Sekarang pun begitu. SBY, mau naikkan atau turunkan atau status quo harga BBM, itu juga bukan karena PDI-P. Ukuran Pak SBY itu hanya rakyat dan kepentingan nasional, bukan pencitraan,\" ujarnya.\n\n\"Belum berkuasa, eh kini sudah mulai enggak pede. Makanya, ngono yo ngono, ning ojo ngono. Santun ajalah,\" tambah Ramadhan.\n\nSBY dan Jokowi akan melakukan pertemuan di Bali pada hari ini untuk membahas masalah transisi pemerintahan. Dalam kesempatan tersebut, Jokowi juga mengaku akan membahas masalah BBM bersubsidi.\n\nSejumlah kalangan meminta agar Presiden segera mengatasi krisis BBM dengan menaikkan harga BBM.\n\nPT Pertamina mengumumkan, setelah mendapat arahan dari pemerintah, mereka menormalkan pasokan BBM ke masyarakat. Hal ini dilakukan agar tidak terjadi antrean panjang di stasiun pengisian bahan bakar untuk umum (SPBU) di sejumlah daerah.\n\nAkan tetapi, langkah ini tidak menghilangkan ancaman krisis BBM karena alokasi kuota BBM bersubsidi yang mencapai 46 juta kiloliter akan segera habis apabila tidak ada langkah strategis.\n\nPDI-P sempat menentang ketika pemerintah hendak menaikkan harga BBM bersubsidi (baca: Ini Alasan PDI-P Menolak Opsi Pemerintah soal Kenaikan Harga BBM dan PDI-P Lobi Partai Lain Tolak Harga BBM Naik).\n\nPemerintah akhirnya memutuskan untuk menaikkan BBM bersubsidi sebesar Rp 6.500 untuk jenis premium dan Rp 5.500 untuk solar per liter pada 22 Juni 2013 (baca: Sah, Harga Premium Jadi Rp 6.500 dan Solar Rp 5.500 Per Liter).", "title": "Demokrat: Karma, Dulu PDI-P Asal Njeplak Tolak Kenaikan BBM", "publishedDate": "2014-08-27T13:56:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5t6YtbUHHcA", "description": "Website:  http://fatquartershop.com\nQuilt:  http://www.fatquartershop.com/suburban-downloadable-pdf-quilt-pattern\nPliers:  http://amzn.to/1jYukr2\nWire Cutters:  http://amzn.to/1jYuu1C\nBead Wire:  http://amzn.to/1ip7gfA\n\nBarbara Groves of Me & My Sister Designs shows you how to make scissor fobs.

But the Japanese and Germans are also discovered to be on this island together and USS SEAVIPER's landing party is forced to separate.

It is the only non-royal non-episcopal country house in England to hold the title of palace. The palace, one of England's largest houses, was built between 1705 and circa 1722. Blenheim Palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.\n\nIts construction was originally intended to be a gift to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, from a grateful nation in return for military triumph against the French and Bavarians at the Battle of Blenheim. However, it soon became the subject of political infighting, which led to Marlborough's exile, the fall from power of his duchess, and irreparable damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh.\n\nDesigned in the rare, and short-lived, English Baroque style, architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s. It is unique in its combined usage as a family home, mausoleum and national monument. The palace is also notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nThe building of the palace was a minefield of political intrigue by Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Following the palace's completion, it became the home of the Churchill family for the next 300 years, and various members of the family have in that period wrought various changes, in the interiors, park and gardens. At the end of the 19th century, the palace was saved from ruin by funds gained from the 9th Duke of Marlborough's marriage to American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt. The exterior of the palace remains in good repair.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nWe would like to hear from you!

A priceless diamond has been stolen, and the thieves responsible are using Nick as their scapegoat. An escaped convict with nowhere to run, Nick realizes that no one will believe he is innocent, and he decides to take extreme measures in order to expose the men who set him up. Stepping out on a ledge 25 stories above the bustling concrete streets of New York City, the notorious fugitive quickly becomes a media sensation as the entire world watches, awaiting his next move. Meanwhile, Nick's loyal brother races to help clear his sibling's name and ensure that the guilty pay for their crimes before the situation ends in tragedy.

More precisely, it is the solid figure bounded by a plane base and the surface (called the lateral surface) formed by the locus of all straight line segments joining the apex to the perimeter of the base. The term \"cone\" sometimes refers just to the surface of this solid figure, or just to the lateral surface.\nThe axis of a cone is the straight line (if any), passing through the apex, about which the lateral surface has a rotational symmetry.\n\nIn common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be right circular, where right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base (suitably defined) at right angles to its plane, and circular means that the base is a circle. Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the axis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base. In general, however, the base may be any shape, and the apex may lie anywhere (though it is often assumed that the base is bounded and has nonzero area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of the base). For example, a pyramid is technically a cone with a polygonal base.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Frustum Of a Cone", "publishedDate": "2010-05-06T05:36:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5tQR35wImxc", "description": "Check out https://www.youtube.com/user/VideoGamesSourceWiiU & http://videogames-source.com/ Subscribe!

If you're sweating too much consider miraDry.\n\nExcessive underarm sweat can cause anxiety at work, embarrassment in relationships and social settings, and frustration over constantly ruining clothes with sweat stains. Excessive sweat can also have devastating effects on your emotional well-being and self-image, and impact how you feel about yourself and even how others perceive you.\n\nIf you have excessive underarm sweat, you may be suffering from a medical condition known as axillary hyperhidrosis.\n\nUnderarm sweat is produced through two types of sweat glands located just below the surface of the skin. The eccrine glands secrete a clear, odorless fluid to help cool the body. The evaporation of sweat from the surface of the skin creates the cooling effect. The apocrine glands produce a thicker fluid that gives underarm sweat its distinctive odor.\n\nThe outpatient procedure is performed in the physician's office and does not involve surgical incisions or cuts. The clinician customizes treatment for each underarm with multiple placements of the miraDry System. The miraDry System delivers electromagnetic energy non-invasively to the area where the sweat glands reside.

However note we'll need the US to grow at three percent this year to ensure the Eurozone moves higher. \n\nOn the Macro side, Draghi has been vocal over the last 24 hours explaining that the Eurozone is not in a deflationary environment. Yellen stands firm that the US is better shape in terms of economic growth, and so expect another taper to the tune of USD 10 billion at the next meeting in March. She did state that this will be reviewed in April.\nLooking ahead to next week, these are the major events on Michael's radar:\n\nThe Euro remains the 'risk on, risk off'  trade, whilst Sterling is expected to continue to grind higher into 1.70; as interest rate hikes become the talk of the BoE.\n\nWe've seen Gold continue a solid start to the year, but this week we're set for a weekly decline of 0.8 percent. RSI suggests gold may be overbought and I strongly feel that if the markets move higher, then gold sells back off into 1250, so be careful gold traders.\n\nMarkets next week are all about the macro to see out the end of Q1. We still see low double digit growth in terms of returns for the year, so we should see a healthy month for gains in March; depending on the data we receive. Look for ISM data on Monday which we need to see above 53, the last reading was abysmal so to change sentiment and see markets accelerate we'll definitely need ISM numbers to come in above 53 and NFP on Friday at 175k.\n\nImplied volatility is low, so contrariness will be prepared for a pull back.

He is suffering from cancer of the oesophagus, has described his illness as \"a bit of a yawn\" and accepted that it is a result of his hard drinking and smoking lifestyle. He has been told that he has only a one in 20 chance of living for longer than five years. \n\nHe said he was not surprised by the diagnosis, which came earlier this summer, and said: \"If you've led a rather bohemian and rackety life, as I have, it's precisely the cancer that you'd expect to get\" \"I think my main fear is of being incapacitated or imbecilic at the end. That, of course, is not something to be afraid of, it's something to be terrified of\" \"But for my family it's not very nice. I could wish perhaps to have led a more healthy and upright life for their sake, and that's a very melancholy reflection, of course...I feel a sense of waste about it because I'm not ready\"\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/12/In-Memoriam-Christopher-Hitchens-19492011 Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

And today, the sequester will almost certainly happen, a year and a half after its inception amid the stalemate of the debt-limit crisis in 2011.\n\nAutomatic budget cuts will be triggered across federal agencies, as President Obama will be required to order sequestration into effect before midnight Friday night. The federal bureaucracy will implement its various plans to save the money it's required to save.\n\nRead more: How Automatic Cuts Could Hurt at the Local Level\n\nNow that the sequester will probably happen, here are some questions and answers about it:\n\n1. HOW BIG IS IT?\n\nThe cuts were originally slated for $109 billion this year, but after the fiscal-cliff deal postponed the sequester for two months by finding alternate savings, the sequester will amount to $85 billion over the next 10 months. In 2013, nondefense programs will be cut by nine percent, and defense programs will be cut by 13 percent.\n\nIf carried out over 10 years (as designed), the sequester will amount to $1.2 trillion in total.\n\n2. WHAT WILL BE CUT, SPARED?\n\nMost government programs will be cut, with the cuts distributed evenly (by dollar amount) between defense and nondefense programs.\n\n \nAP Photo|Getty Images\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio,...

Social Security checks won't shrink; nor will Veterans Administration programs. Medicare benefits won't get cut, but payments to providers will shrink by two percent. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), food stamps, Pell grants, and Medicaid will all be shielded from the sequester.\n\nBut lots of things will get cut. The Obama administration has warned that a host of calamities will befall vulnerable segments of the population.\n\nRead more: Sequester May Revive 'Amtrak' Joe Biden\n\n3. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO BAD?\n\nQuestions persist over whether or not it really does.\n\nThe sequester will mean such awful things because it forces agencies to cut indiscriminately, instead of simply stripping money from their overall budgets.\n\nBut some Republicans, including Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, have suggested that federal agencies have plenty of flexibility to implement these cuts while avoiding the worst of the purported consequences. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal accused President Obama of trying to \"distort\" the severity of the sequester. The federal government will still spend more money than it did last year, GOP critics of sequester alarmism have pointed out.\n\nRead more: 57 Terrible Consequences of the Sequester\n\nThe White House tells a different story.\n\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, the sequestration law forces agency heads to cut the same percentage from each program. If that program is for TSA agents at airports, the sequester law doesn't care, and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano can't do anything about it.\n\nAgency heads do have some authority to \"reprogram\" funds, rearranging their money to circumvent the bad effects. An OMB official told ABC News that \"these flexibilities are limited and do not provide significant relief due to the rigid nature of the way in which sequestration is required by law to be implemented.\"", "title": "Sequestration", "publishedDate": "2013-03-01T20:21:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5tgVLKVVkiw", "description": "Een Grote Brokken productie\nwww.grotebrokken.nl\nRegie en productie: Jeroen Houben\nConcept: Aaron van Valen, Tim Arts en Ruud Geurts\nD.O.P.:  Nanko Goeting\nCamera ass.: Peter van Beek\nGaffer: Pieter van den berg\nProductie assistente: Elseline Hokke\nSet-Dresser: Marianne Lock\nRunners: Maarten Geurts en Rochdi Sadgi\nEditor: Wouter van Luijn\nGrading: Jeroen Houben\nDank aan: Dolores de Booij, Stephan van Mulekom, Chiron Holwijn, Blanche Speelman, Fl\u00fcgel,  en alle toegewijde figuranten\n\n\nMusic video by FeestDJRuud performing Gas Op Die Lollie.

It's easy to find, from the home refrigerator to the nearest rubbish bucket. In this case the effect of the magnifying glass. We should pour a clear water into the bottle and using the sunshine, focus the sun beam on the paper.\nNote that in case of a bad weather that won't work. That's the only disadvantage of this method. For the fire we use a simple paper. It should be of a dark color (with the pictures or text, newspaper), there's nothing complicated in it, everything is made of the make-shifts.

David and his wife are perfectly happy - or so he believes. When he finds out the home he shares with his wife and son was the scene of a ghastly turn-of-the-century murder, David dismisses it as ancient history. That is, until the sinister history ripples into the present and casts a shadow over life as he knows it. And when a looming secret shatters his marriage, David can\u2019t help but suspect the dark spirits of the house are somehow involved. In his drive to unveil the shadows hidden in the walls, David begins to descend into insanity, threatening the lives of everyone around him. Through ghastly imagery and a chilling score, Ivan Kavanagh\u2019s The Canal is an Irish ghost story that will leave you with a fear of the dark and a dripping chill down your spine long after the film\u2019s conclusion.\n\n\"the canal\" \"the canal movie\" \"the canal trailer\" horror scary \"scary movie\" \"rupert evans\" \"Antonia Campbell-Hughes\" \"Steve Oram\" \"Ivan Kavanagh\" \"film archivist\" murder sinister secret \"dark spirits\" insanity \"ghost story\" irish fear vchan", "title": "The Canal Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Rupert Evans Horror Movie HD", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T16:15:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ttFvwAbqGI", "description": "This video demonstrates the versatility and simple use of Fresco Harmony\u00ae.

C., y cuyo nombre era Agias. Un descendiente suyo, D\u00e1oco, tetrarca de su pa\u00eds, al realizar en Farsalia un monumento a sus antepasados, encarg\u00f3 esta obra, en bronce, al a\u00fan joven artista, y unos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en el 337, hizo ejecutar copias en m\u00e1rmol para dedicarlas en Delfos. Lo que a nosotros ha llegado es precisamente esta copia. El Agias se nos presenta, decididamente, como una obra de Policleto transformada. Y no deja de ser significativo c\u00f3mo, al igual que Prax\u00edteles y Escopas, Lisipo es capaz de darle a los modelos del viejo maestro argivo un planteamiento nuevo y personal, acorde a sus propios intereses: en su estatua advertimos, por debajo de la estructura geom\u00e9trica de los m\u00fasculos, c\u00f3mo se rompe el juego de pesos y contrapesos: el atleta se apoya en su pierna derecha, pero su brazo activo es tambi\u00e9n el derecho, que deb\u00eda doblarse y sostener una palma, y no el izquierdo, como exigir\u00eda el canon de Policleto. Tambi\u00e9n notamos que la cabeza cobra movimiento, al inclinarse hacia la izquierda sobre un cuello torcido hacia la derecha, y que, adem\u00e1s, las proporciones del cuerpo se han alargado, sumando un total de ocho cabezas. La consecuencia es obvia: el cuerpo entero del Agias vibra y parece aligerarse, incluso con sus dos talones pegados al suelo. Y todo esto se acent\u00faa, como en Escopas, d\u00e1ndole importancia a la cara a trav\u00e9s de unos ojos profundos, un tanto so\u00f1adores. \n\n\nDetalles de la imagen 'Apoxiomenos. Lisipo. H. 325 a.C.'\n\n    * Espacio: Se ve en ella una caracter\u00edstica novedosa: el espacio. La escultura tiene que verse en diferentes puntos de vista, rompiendo as\u00ed la frontalidad y el hieratismo. Se da movimiento con el brazo extendido.\n    * Contrapposto: Usa un forzado contrapposto (una pierda extendida que recoge el peso mientras la otra est\u00e1 flexinada ligeramente), siendo una caracter\u00edstica novedosa de movimiento y que da paso al periodo hel\u00e9nico.\n    * Atleta: Es la representaci\u00f3n de un atleta, pero no en el momento triunfal que era lo habitual, sino en una acci\u00f3n cotidiana. Est\u00e1 limpi\u00e1ndose el aceite y polvo gracias a un estr\u00edgilo. Es la representaci\u00f3n idea de Agias, atleta y alto dignatario de Tesalia\n    * Movimiento: El brazo izquierdo se flexiona, en contra de la pierna derecha que se flexiona. Este ritmo zigzageante hace cobrar vida y movimiento a la escultura.\n    * Copia: La hoja de parra confirma que se trata de una copia romana de m\u00e1rmol. La mayor\u00eda de las esculturas griegas nos han llegado as\u00ed, gracias a copias posteriores.\n    * Influencia: La bella anatom\u00eda del atleta viene dada por una serie de influencias que tuvo Lisipo: Praxiteles, Escopas y Fidias. Los grandes autores cl\u00e1sicos por excelencia.\n    * Proporci\u00f3n: Esta escultura mide 2.05 m y tiene la novedad de que se usa el canon de ocho cabezas. El canon era la manera de representaci\u00f3n ideal, por lo que un canon de ocho cabezas quiere decir que la cabeza del atleta es un m\u00f3dulo que se repite ocho veces a lo largo del cuerpo.", "title": "Apoxiomenos.

The male is called a peacock, the female a peahen, and the offspring peachicks. The adult female peafowl is grey and/or brown. Peachicks can be between yellow and a tawny colour with darker brown patches or light tan and ivory, also referred to as \"dirty white\". The term also embraces the Congo Peafowl, which is placed in a separate genus Afropavo.\n\nIn common with other members of the Galliformes, males possess metatarsal spurs or \"thorns\" used primarily during intraspecific fights.\n\nWhite peacocks are not albinos; they have a genetic mutation that is known as Leucism, which causes the lack of pigments in the plumage. Albino animals and birds have a complete lack of color and red or pink eyes while White peafowl have blue eyes. The white color appears in other domestically bred peafowl but in different quantities. Chicks are born yellow and become white as they mature, according to the Peafowl Varieties Database. Indian peafowl of all colors, including white, have pink skin.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "title": "Origami Peacock Instructions", "publishedDate": "2014-01-16T11:55:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "5uEBl2x78SI", "description": "Alessandro Vespignani, Sternberg Distinguished Professor of Physics, Computer Science and Health Sciences, explains how network science can not only predict the path of virus before it spreads around the world, but can potentially prevent it.\nVideo by Northeastern News", "title": "Using network science to forecast the spread of emerging diseases", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T22:34:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5uEFmRnuCLc", "description": "9th Ode for Dormition (\u0437\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b) sung at Liturgy 30Oct2009 (12th Sunday after Pentecost, Sunday after Dormition) at Sts.

Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes seem to have developed the audience's taste for untraceable, fast-acting poisons. However, murder mystery is one thing, but when the story becomes reality, you have got yourself a real killer! Here is a list of the most famous poisons used to kill people throughout history.\nHemlock\nHemlock or Conium is a highly toxic flowering plant indigenous to Europe and South Africa. It was a popular one with the ancient Greeks, who used it to kill off their prisoners. For an adult, the ingestion of 100mg of conium or about 8 leaves of the plant is fatal -- death comes in the form of paralysis, your mind is wide awake, but your body doesn't respond and eventually the respiratory system shuts down. Probably the most famous hemlock poisoning is that of Greek philosopher, Socrates. Condemned to death for impiety in 399 BC, he was given a very concentrated infusion of hemlock.\nAconite\nBelladonna\nDimethylmercury\nTetrodotoxin\nThis substance is found in two marine creatures -- the blue-ringed octopus and the puffer fish. However, the octopus is the most dangerous, because it purposely injects its venom, killing it in minutes. It carries enough venom to kill 26 human adults within minutes and the bites are often painless, so many victims realize they have been bitten only when paralysis sets in. On the other hand, the puffer fish is only lethal if you want to eat it, but if it is well prepared, meaning the venom is taken out, the only thing that's left is the adrenaline of eating something which could kill you.\nPolonium\nPolonium is a radioactive poison, a slow killer with no cure. One gram of vaporised polonium can kill about 1.5 million people in just a couple of months. The most famous case of polonium poisoning is that of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. Polonium was found in his tea cup -- a dose 200 times higher than the median lethal dose in case of ingestion. He died in three weeks.\nMercury\nThere are three forms of mercury which are extremely dangerous. Elemental mercury is the one you can find in glass thermometers, it's not harmful if touched, but lethal if inhaled. Inorganic mercury is used to make batteries, and is deadly only when ingested. And finally, organic mercury is found in fish, such as tuna and swordfish (consumption should be limited to 170g per week), but can be potentially deadly over long periods of time. A famous death caused by mercury is that of Amadeus Mozart, who was given mercury pills to treat his syphilis.\nCyanide\nNow here's one right out of an Agatha Christie novel. Cyanide seems to be extremely popular (spies use cyanide pills to kill themselves when caught) and there are plenty of reasons for this. Firstly, it is found in a great variety of substances like almonds, apple seeds, apricot kernel, tobacco smoke, insecticides, pesticides and the list goes on. Murder in this case can be blamed on a household accident, such as ingestion of pesticide -- a fatal dose of cyanide for humans is 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight. Secondly, it's a rapid killer: depending on the dose, death occurs within 1 to 15 minutes. Also, in its gaseous form -- hydrogen cyanide -- it was the agent used by Nazi Germany for mass murders in gas chambers during the Holocaust.\nBotulinum Toxin\nIf you're watching Sherlock Holmes, then you'll know about this one. The Botulinum toxin causes Botulism, a fatal condition if not treated immediately. It involves muscle paralysis, eventually leading to the paralysis of the respiratory system and, consequently, death. The bacteria enter the body through open wounds or by ingesting contaminated food. By the way, botulinum toxin is the same stuff used for Botox injections!\nArsenic\nArsenic has been called \"The King of Poisons\", for its discreetness and potency -- it was virtually undetectable, so it was very often used either as a murder weapon or as a mystery story element. But that's until the Marsh test came and signalled the presence of this poison in water, food and the like. However, this king of poisons has taken many famous lives: Napoleon Bonaparte, George the 3rd of England and Simon Bolivar to name a few. On another note, arsenic, like belladonna, was used by the Victorians for cosmetic reasons. A couple of drops of the stuff made a woman's complexion white and pale.

Lauren Hill, 19, was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), an inoperable brain condition, in November 2013, not long after she committed to playing college basketball at Cincinnati\u2019s Mount St. Joseph\u2019s University on her 18th birthday. Last month, Hill, who was recruited as a local high school standout, got the news that her brain tumor had grown and she had only months to live.

HCG is a fast and safe way to lose a pound a day. Please make an appointment for a free consultation by calling 702-878-8888.\n\n\nIn molecular biology, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, a component of the fertilized egg, after conception. Following implantation, the syncytiotrophoblast gives rise to the placenta.[1][2] Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant can lead to a cancer diagnosis. However, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause or an effect of tumorigenesis. The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.[1][3] As of December 6, 2011, the United States FDA has prohibited the sale of \"homeopathic\" and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.[4][5]\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the LHCG receptor of the blastocyst and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum during the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can sustain the growing fetus. Due to its highly negative charge, hCG may repel the immune cells of the mother, protecting the fetus during the first trimester. It has also been hypothesized that hCG may be a placental link for the development of local maternal immunotolerance. For example, hCG-treated endometrial cells induce an increase in T cell apoptosis (dissolution of T cells). These results suggest that hCG may be a link in the development of peritrophoblastic immune tolerance, and may facilitate the trophoblast invasion, which is known to expedite fetal development in the endometrium.[10] It has also been suggested that hCG levels are linked to the severity of morning sickness in pregnant women.[11]\n\nBecause of its similarity to LH, hCG can also be used clinically to induce ovulation in the ovaries as well as testosterone production in the testes. As the most abundant biological source is women who are presently pregnant, some organizations collect urine from pregnant women to extract hCG for use in fertility treatment.[12][13]\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin also plays a role in cellular differentiation/proliferation and may activate apoptosis.[14]", "title": "HCG Diet In Las Vegas 702 878 8888 HCG Diet", "publishedDate": "2014-01-26T06:10:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5umIWwI0mC8", "description": "Interview mit der Autorin und Stipendiatin des Scriptoriums Christina Bacher.\nhttp://www.AntoniterCityKirche.de", "title": "Das Scriptorium an der Antoniterkirche K\u00f6ln", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T11:19:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5umOr00X0wU", "description": "Subscribe to truTV on YouTube: http://full.sc/1s9KQGe\nWatch Full Episodes for Free: http://full.sc/1rghcLK\nNew episodes Thursdays 9:30/8:30c\nGet the Impractical Jokers App: http://full.sc/1rBFBeA\n\nIt's punishment time and Sal will never talk trash again after this gross ordeal.\n\nIf laughter is contagious, these guys should be quarantined!

Measure up the fabric making sure to have enough space to create the poofy effect. \n2. Layer the pieces on top of each other and start sewing the top. Pull the thread. If the skirt is too large, sew again until you've achieved the desired width.\n3. Sew the side of your skirt making sure to leave around 20 cm open at the top. If you're sewing an elastic band you won't need to do this\n4. Cut a piece of fabric large enough to make a belt. Fold it double and lay it over the top of your skirt.\n5.

Lewis completed a series of practice runs at 10ft and then 600-700ft before ascending to altitude for his record-breaking attempt. A French team known as The Skyliners had attempted a similar feat three weeks earlier, but it was Lewis who held his nerve to balance his way into the record books.

One of three temperature exchangers in a modern automobile, it is in charge of cooling the interior cabin. The other two temperature exchangers are the heater core and the condenser. The evaporator core is also buried inside the instrument cluster or panel, often by the glove compartment side. Some vehicles have two evaporator cores, and there are two occasions when this would happen. One is when it's a large van type vehicle, and there's one at the front, and one at the rear of the vehicle. The other instance is in dual temperature zone cars, mostly the higher end models. \n\nEvaporators are usually made of aluminum. Older R 12 evaporators were often copper, but this is not a good idea on R 134a. Evaporators look like, and in fact are, similar to radiators, but they're thicker and smaller in general size. Evaporators consist of a series of internal tubes with fins attached to them to displace heat or cold. Air will pass unrestricted through the fins, just like a coolant radiator. The passages in the evaporator carry moving refrigerant in a gaseous form.
