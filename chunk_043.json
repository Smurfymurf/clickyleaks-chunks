But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.\n15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.\n16 \u00b6When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;\n17 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.\n18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?\n19 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?\n20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.\n21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent.

It is well known in many English-speaking countries and is often sung to celebrate the start of the new year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day.\n\nThe song's (Scots) title may be translated into English literally as \"old long since\", or more idiomatically, \"long long ago\" or \"days gone by\". The phrase \"Auld Lang Syne\" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (15701638), Allan Ramsay (1686-1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[2] In his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase \"In the days of auld lang syne\" as the equivalent of \"Once upon a time.\" In Scots syne is pronounced like the English word sign.\n\nMy photographs were taken in the last few days of 2008. The moon at the end of the fim was the last moonlight before we entered 2009. This year marks the 250th year since the birth of Robert Burns.\n\n\nAuld Lang Syne\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\nAnd never brought to mind?\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\nAnd auld lang syne? \n\nCHORUS:\nFor auld lang syne, my dear,\nFor auld lang syne,\nWe'll tak a cup of kindness yet,\nFor auld lang syne!\n\nAnd surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,\nAnd surely I'll be mine,\nAnd we'll tak a cup o kindness yet,\nFor auld lang syne!\n\nWe twa hae run about the braes,\nAnd pou'd the gowans fine,\nBut we've wander'd monie a weary fit,\nSin auld lang syne. \n\nWe twa hae paidl'd in the burn\nFrae morning sun till dine,\nBut seas between us braid hae roar'd\nSin auld lang syne. \n\nAnd there's a hand my trusty fiere,\nAnd gie's a hand o thine,\nAnd we'll tak a right guid-willie waught,\nFor auld lang syne\n\nMeanings\n\nauld lang syne - times gone by\nbe - pay for\nbraes - hills\nbraid - broad\nburn - stream\ndine - dinner time\nfiere - friend\nfit - foot\ngowans - daisies\nguid-willie waught - goodwill drink\nmonie - many\nmorning sun - noon\npaidl't - paddled\npint-stowp - pint tankard\npou'd - pulled\ntwa - two\n\nHISTORY\nRobert Burns forwarded a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark, The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man\". At the time it was fashionable to claim someone else's work. It was \"traditional\"; therefore, one should take Burns' statement with mild scepticism. Some of the lyrics were indeed \"collected\" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad \"Old Long Syne\" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns' later poem. It is a fair supposition to attribute the rest of the poem to Burns himself.\n\nThere is some doubt as to whether the melody used today is the same one Burns originally intended, but it is widely used both in Scotland and in the rest of the world.\n\nSinging the song on Hogmanay or New Year's Eve very quickly became a Scots custom that soon spread to other parts of the British Isles. As Scots (and other Britons) emigrated around the world, they took the song with them.\n\nCanadian band leader Guy Lombardo is often credited with popularizing the use of the song at New Years celebrations in America, through his annual broadcasts on radio and television, beginning in 1929. The song became his trademark; in addition to his live broadcasts, he recorded the song more than once, first in 1939, and at least once later, on September 29, 1947, in a record issued as a single by Decca Records as catalog #24260.\n\nHowever, earlier newspaper articles describe revellers on both sides of the Atlantic singing the song to usher in the New Year:\n\n\"Holiday Parties at Lenox\" (Massachusetts, USA) (1896)  The company joined hands in the great music room at midnight and sang Auld Lang Syne as the last stroke of 12 sounded and the new year came in.\n\"New Year's Eve in London\" (London, UK) (1910)  Usual Customs Observed by People of All Classes The passing of the old year was celebrated in London much as usual.

Due to greater suitability with the slow-turning, early steam engines, the first powerboats used paddle wheels for a form of water propulsion. \n\nIn 1660, Toogood and Hays adopted the Archimedean screw as a ship propeller. Even by the 19th century, screw propulsion was still considered only a second-rate means of moving a ship through the water. However, it was during this century that screw propulsion development actually got underway. In 1801, John Stevens experimented with a single-screw and a twin-screw steam-driven boat. Unfortunately, due to a lack of interest, his ideas were not accepted in America.\n\n1.2.1 The Invention of the Screw Propeller\n\nThe acknowledgment for the invention of the modern style propeller goes to Smith and Eriksson, who acquired patents in 1835 for screw propellers, marking the start of it's contemporary development. Eriksson's patent showed a rotating bladed wheel, as well as twin-screw and single-screw installations. Eriksson's propeller design took advantage of benefits of the bladed wheel.\n\n1.2.2 \"I meant to do that!\" - A mishap leads to improvement!\n\nMost of these Archimedean screw inventors came up with little to really improve the configuration of the screw as a propulsion device. Uninspired variations consisted of changing the number of convolutions or altering the diameter over the length of the screw. Francis Petit Smith accidentally discovered the advantages of a \"shortened\" Archimedean screw. Originally, his wooden propeller design had two complete turns (what we might call \"double-pitch\"). Nevertheless, following an accident in a canal, his boat immediately gained speed after half of his blade broke away.\n\nSmith capitalized on the \"lucky\" event by increasing the number of blades and diminishing the blade width - and came up with a design comparable to modern propellers. Notwithstanding this success, it was still many years before propellers truly displaced paddle wheels in ships.\n\n1.2.3 The Last Step\n\nThe final transition to what is now recognizable as a screw propeller was made by George Rennie's conoidal screw. Rennie combined the ideas of increased pitch, multiple threads, and minimum convolutions in what he called a Conoidal propeller, patented in 1840.\n\nDespite the successes of Smith, Eriksson and Rennie, there remained many implementation problems to be solved for screw-propelled ships. Early wooden ships were subjected to heavy vibration, and iron hulls were needed to resist the vibratory forces. With shaft and machinery below the waterline, stuffing boxes and transmissions had to be developed to prevent leakage. Thrust bearings were required to transmit the force exerted by the propeller to the hull.

Williams-Sonoma culinary expert Amanda shares with you some important tips about preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nIt is important to know what kind of turkey to buy. A fresh turkey will always have a tasty flavor. Williams-Sonoma has a great selection of fresh turkeys available online during the holiday season. If you are planning to use a frozen turkey, it will take at least 3 to 4 days to defrost it. It is better to prepare your turkey well in advance than to wake up to a frozen turkey on Thanksgiving morning.\n\nBefore preparing your Thanksgiving turkey for roasting, it is important to rinse and dry it properly. Dry the insides of the cavity carefully so that the turkey is roasted instead of steamed.  After drying the turkey, place it at room temperature for an hour. After an hour, add flavor to your turkey by rubbing compound butter (butter mixed with herbs and various spices) or plain butter on the outside of the turkey as well as in between the skin and the meat.\n\nAfter flavoring it with butter, you should season the turkey with salt and pepper and even season inside the cavity area for that extra flavor. If you want to stuff the turkey, you can do it at this stage. If you are carving the turkey at the table then you can tress it to make it more presentable. With this preparation complete, you are ready to transfer your turkey to the roasting rack to begin cooking. \n\nTo explore further, visit our Williams-Sonoma website: http://www.williams-sonoma.com\n\nGet a great roast turkey recipe at:\nhttp://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/roast-turkey.html \n\nGet another amazing turkey recipe at: \nhttp://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/roasted-turkey-with--herb-butter.html", "title": "How to Prepare a Thanksgiving Turkey for Roasting | Williams-Sonoma", "publishedDate": "2010-10-26T17:46:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1fPgRjk8hYI", "description": "Se muestran ejemplos de sonidos producidos por se\u00f1ales peri\u00f3dicas.", "title": "04-Series de Fourier-03-Senoidales", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T16:43:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1fPyIqXeZlo", "description": "Find this and many other great soundtracks at:\nhttp://www.TheGameMusicGuy.com\n\nGet the game at:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/204180/\n\nGet the Soundtrack at:\nhttp://scottmcfadyen.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-the-video-game-waveform\n\nNavigate the beauty and hazards of the solar system while riding on a wave of light in this innovative action-puzzle game.

It is the ninth installment in the Need for Speed series. The game features street racing-oriented game play, with certain customization options from the Need for Speed: Underground series.

'Abdullah b. 'Umar as saying:\nO people of Iraq, how strange it is that you ask about the minor sins but commit major sins? I heard from my father 'Abdullah b. 'Umar, narrating that he heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying while pointing his hand towards the east: Verily. the turmoil would come from this side, from where appear the horns of Satan and you would strike the necks of one another; and Moses killed a person from among the people of Pharaoh unintentionally and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:\" You killed a person but We relieved you from the grief and tried you with (many a) trial\" (xx. 40). Ahmad b. Umar reported this hadith from Salim, but he did not make a mention of the words:\" I heard\".\n[Sahih Muslim]\n\n________________________________________________________\nTo watch the complete lecture click Below: (divided in 9 parts)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PFJI_iq2Ec\n__________________________________________________________\n\nWith regard to the word \"Wahhaabis\", some people use this word to refer to the message of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Sulaymaan al-Tameemi al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him), and they call him and his followers Wahhaabis. Everyone who has any knowledge of the movement of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) and his message knows that he sought to spread the message of pure Tawheed and to warn against shirk in all its forms, such as attachment to the dead, or to trees and rocks, etc. In his 'aqeedah (belief), he was following the way of the righteous Salaf and the Taabi'een [i.e., the earliest generations of Islam], as is indicated by his books and fatwas, and the books of his followers among his sons and grandsons and others. All of these books are in print and are in circulation among the people. His message was in accordance with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Wahhaabism is not a new way or a new school of thought; rather it is a call to Tawheed and the revival of aspects of the religion that had been forgotten. What you have to do is to beware of those who warn you against the Wahhaabis, because they are warning you against following the truth and the early generation of this ummah. Applying the word \"Wahhaabis\" to those who adhere to correct belief and warning people against them is the way of the ignorant and biased. We ask Allaah to keep you safe and sound.\n\nSee Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 3/1206; see also Question # 12203.

Atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis, infantile eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, and varicose eczema are but a few of the many types of this skin disorder. The most common type is atopic dermatitis, which is often seen in infants and small children. (Nine out of ten of eczema cases happen in children younger than five years old.) Rarer forms include dyshidrotic eczema, which occurs in warm weather, and nummular eczema, which occurs mostly during winter.\nhttp://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nDuring an eczema flare-up, the person experiences itching and rashes that may be red or brownish, scaly, dry, thick, leathery, crusty or flaky. These may also appear as blisters oozing fluid, or as small, elevated bumps on the skin. In some cases, the skin simply becomes thick, rough and red. When scratched, eczema rashes may be infected, and this can worsen the inflammation. The rashes are often found on the arms, legs, chest, hands, or the face. In children, the rashes typically appear on the cheeks, elbows or knees, especially in skin folds.\n\nEczema is believed to be caused by a hereditary impairment of the immune system. A person with eczema often has family members who also have eczema, asthma or hay fever. The standard treatment is anti-itch topical medications, including anti-histamines. This treatment only relieves the symptoms, and does not cure eczema. There is, in fact, no known cure for eczema. It is a lifelong skin problem that recurs every now and then.\n\nWhile eczema has no cure, there are many management strategies to keep it under control, relieve the itchiness and discomfort, and prolong the time between recurrences. Besides medicinal anti-itch lotions, there too are eczema home remedies and skin care measures that can be used to manage eczema effectively.\n\nEczema home remedies include herbs and natural ingredients that can be made into lotions, pastes or ointments, and then applied on the rashes or affected skin areas. They are proven effective in providing relief from itching and inflammation.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Virginia Tech vs Duke | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T22:36:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "1g5IUk2uGkU", "description": "One of the Happiest Days of My Life ...  https://sites.google.com/site/siamcomphys/events/theendofcomputationalphysicskku  (credit: \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e40\u0e14\u0e42\u0e01\u0e30 OverPle Cover, \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30 \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c \u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e16\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e15\u0e36\u0e01\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e01\u0e33\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e42\u0e14\u0e19\u0e17\u0e38\u0e1a)", "title": "\u0e22\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e22 Computational Physics@KKU", "publishedDate": "2014-09-12T18:19:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1g5fLgsSQWU", "description": "zero degrees is a remarkable collaboration between four of today's most respected artists. \n\nMoroccan-Flemish SIDI LARBI CHERKAOUI is well known for his work with Les Ballets C. de la B. while AKRAM KHAN is world renowned for developing his own 'contemporary Kathak' style, winning numerous awards.

Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) was once a star player on the Richmond High School basketball team in Richmond, CA, and years later, after establishing himself in publishing and marketing, he returns to the school and to the team as the new basketball coach. Carter quickly sees that his work is cut out for him -- the team is having an awful season, and their fights off the court are more decisive than their play on the court. While Carter wants to make the Richmond cagers into a winning team, he also wants a lot more -- to teach the boys to respect themselves and one another, and that they must excel in the classroom as well as in the gymnasium. Under Carter's guidance, the team turns their losing season around, with the state title a genuine possibility. However, when Carter learns that a number of his players have let their grade point averages slip below 2.3, as mandated in a contract he entered into with the students, he decides to lock the team out of the gym and send them into study hall until their marks improve. Carter's plan quickly becomes a subject of controversy among parents and team boosters, and their objections are soon picked up by the local news media, many of whom are not sympathetic to Carter's belief that his players must have goals beyond college ball or the NBA. Coach Carter also features Rob Brown and Rick Gonzalez as members of the team, and R&B diva Ashanti in her film debut as the girlfriend of one of Carter's players.\n\n\"coach carter\",\"coach carter clip\",\"coach carter part 1\",\"coach carter full movie\",\"samuel l jackson\",\"channing tatum\",\"rick gonzalez\",\"rob brown\",\"robert richard\",\"antwon tanner\",\"nana gbewonyo\",\"texas battle\",\"clyde goins\",\"basketball videos\",\"clipboard videos\",\"sports dramas\",basketball,biography,drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"sports stories\",\"triumph of the underdogs\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++304499,/m/0f5xn,/m/084snt,/m/09knm1,/m/05knq2,/m/087v8v,/m/0f9vlr,/m/06lvlf,/m/09x8hz", "title": "Coach Carter (3/9) Movie CLIP - Push-Ups and Suicides (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T19:57:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1g837fLh3dY", "description": "http://usmlefasttrack.com/?p=6040  Pulmonary, Vascular, Resistance, , Findings, symptoms, findings, causes, mnemonics, review, what is, video, study, Rapid Review, Clinical presenation, First Aid, for, USMLE, Step 1, images, wiki, define, wikipedia, 2013, videos, exam, prep, easy, What is usmle, mnemonic, causes,", "title": "Pulmonary Vascular Resistance", "publishedDate": "2013-12-06T08:54:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "1g8IIuV1Jis", "description": "IG At POPPINSPAWN !

The anatomy of this blood vessel can be quite variable. In some rare variations for example, it also drains thoracic veins, bronchial veins and even gonadal veins. The vein is so named because it has no symmetrically equivalent vein on the left side of the body.\n\nIt is formed by the union of the ascending lumbar veins with the right subcostal veins at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, ascending in the posterior mediastinum, and arching over the right main bronchus posteriorly at the root of the right lung to join the superior vena cava. This \"arch of the azygos vein\" (arcus venae azygos) is an important anatomic landmark. As a rare anatomical variation, the arch can be displaced laterally, thereby creating a pleural septum separating an azygos lobe from the upper lobe of the right lung.\n\nA major tributary is the hemiazygos vein, a similar structure on the opposite side of the vertebral column. Other tributaries include the bronchial veins, pericardial veins, and posterior right intercostal veins.

I'm Deborah and today we'll be preparing a fantastic recipe: Sangria. Let's see what we'll need:\n\u2022 2 Lemons\n\u2022 2 oranges\n\u2022 1 apple\n\u2022 2 peaches\n\u2022 A small glass of brandy\n\u2022 1 vanilla pod \u2022 3 small pieces of cinnamon\n\u2022 6 cloves\n\u2022 2/3 of a cup of sugar\n\u2022 1 quart of red wine\n\u2022 2 cups lemon-lime fizzy soda\nLet's make our sangria.\nFirst of all, pour the sugar into a bowl big enough for all the ingredients. Now add the wine, the glass of brandy (which will make it irresistible), the vanilla pod which should be cut beforehand, the cinnamon and cloves. Now, with a ladle, mix the sangria until the sugar is completely dissolved and let it rest for a few minutes so the flavours disperse.\nHere's what to do with the fruit. The peaches and apple into bite-size cubes without removing the skins. Cut half of an orange and half a lemon into slices, and juice one orange and one lemon. Now add the fruit to the wine, add the orange and lemon juice, and finally add the citrus slices to both flavour and decorate the sangria. Finish with a quick stir, cover the wine with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or even better, overnight.\nI've removed the sangria from the fridge and now we're ready for the final touch. Add the lemon-lime soda and if you'd like, some ice cubes to chill. Mix it together and the sangria is ready!

Starring Topher Grace, Anna Faris, Dan Fogler and Teresa Palmer, Take Me Home Tonight is a raunchy, romantic and ultimately touching blast from the past set to an awesome soundtrack of timeless rock and hip-hop hits.\n\nRecent MIT grad Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) should be working for a Fortune 500 company and starting his upward climb to full-fledged yuppie-hood. Instead, the directionless 23-year-old confounds family and friends by taking a part-time job behind the counter of a video store at the Sherman Oaks Galleria.\n\nBut Matt's silent protest against maturity comes to a screeching halt once his unrequited high school crush, Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer), walks into the store.  When she invites him to an epic, end-of-summer party, Matt thinks he finally might have a chance with the girl of his dreams.  With his cynical twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris) and best friend Barry (Dan Fogler), Matt embarks on a once-in-a-lifetime evening. From stealing a car to a marriage proposal to an indescribable, no-holds-barred dance-off, these friends share experiences that will change the course of their lives on one unforgettable night in the Go-Go '80s.\n\nTake Me Home Tonight trailer courtesy Relativity Media.", "title": "Atomic Tom \"Don't You Want Me\" From \"Take Me Home Tonight\" Soundtrack", "publishedDate": "2011-02-11T00:53:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gP-fKiyH4g", "description": "Facial Injectables Market @ http://www.marketreportsonline.com/285796.html.", "title": "Facial Injectables Industry", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T13:32:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gPI22_2fFw", "description": "Director:  Blair Osmani\nSpring 2012\n\nOur school's take on the popular \"$&!# People Say\" videos.", "title": "Stuff R.H.King Students Say", "publishedDate": "2012-11-16T18:10:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gPcoRVuF9I", "description": "Surgery of the Foot and Ankle: http://astore.amazon.com/nichogiovi-20\nPopular Running Shoes: http://astore.amazon.com/nichogiovi-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=2\n\n\"Hallux Limitus\" and \"Hallux Rigidus\" describe a pathological condition involving the first metatarsalphalangeal joint.  Hallux limitus refers to a limited range of motion during functional use, such as walking and running especially on inclines.  When the structural degeneration advances to the state where there is no motion of the first MTPJ at all, it is then called Hallux Rigidus.  \n \nMorphologic characteristics of Hallux Limitus are visible with the use of Radiography.  A radiograph in the AP view would be needed to assess a relatively long first metatarsal in comparison to the lesser metatarsals.  When viewed on a lateral radiograph, Hallux Limitus may be noted in correlation with an elevated 1st metatarsal, where either the entire metatarsal itself is abnormally elevated above the lesser metatarsals or simply the head itself is in a relatively dorsiflexed position over the shaft.  Over time, Hallux Limitus can lead to the formation of an exostosis on the dorsal surface of the first metatarsal head and a painful swelling on the dorsal surface overlying the first metatarsal head.\n \nWhen conservative care fails, surgical intervention may then be utilized.

Byron wants to buy a home but he only has a small down payment to pay for it. Byron would need to get a mortgage for the remainder...\n\nA mortgage is a loan, usually from a bank, that provides a home buyer with the money required to purchase a home. In return for receiving a loan, the homebuyer needs to pay back the bank with interest.\n\nLet's assume that Byron has $10,000 and would like to purchase a $200,000 home. In this case, Byron doesn't have enough cash to pay for his home. Byron will need to borrow $190,000.\n\nByron chooses a 30-year amortization 5% fixed rate mortgage. - Don't worry, I will explain what all of that means in another video... This means that Byron must make monthly payments to his  bank of $1,014. After making this payment for 30 years, Byron will own his house!\n\nCongratulations Byron, on purchasing your first home!!\n\nOver the course of 30 years, Byron pays back the $190,000 he owes the bank plus $175,000 in interest. In very simple terms, this means that his $200,000 home actually cost him $375,000.\n\nHowever, if the loan was paid back, in let's say, 20 years, Byron would save a over $65,000\n\nByron's mortgage helped him purchase his home. But it's important for him to remember that his home is also a type of debt. The faster he pays off his mortgage, the less he pays in interest, the sooner Byron becomes debt free.\n\nThank you for watching!", "title": "Mortgage Basics - What is a Mortgage?", "publishedDate": "2012-01-08T09:30:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gVPx564luE", "description": "who would have thought?", "title": "Let's play Dragonica part 18: 2 zones before the boss*Gasp*", "publishedDate": "2010-07-30T23:20:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gVR0wj-xFA", "description": "Class 5MT Black 5 4-6-0 No. 44932 heads north out of Preston having taken over the 1Z54 06:00 'The Lancastrian' St Neots-Carnforth-Settle-Blackburn-Preston excursion with Class 47 No. 47760 at the rear on Saturday 16th February 2013, passing Class 47 No. 47237 in the siding, which brought the train in.", "title": "Class 5MT No. 44932 departs Preston with The Lancastrian", "publishedDate": "2013-03-23T18:53:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gVb4lfzLTs", "description": "Tucanos (Ramphastidae) na fia\u00e7\u00e3o do Pamals.\nData: 09 Junho 2014\nToucans (Ramphastidae)  in the wires at Pamals air base\nDate: June 9th, 2014", "title": "Tucanos", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T23:02:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gVbOfDg7Bo", "description": "Subscribe for new videos: http://bit.ly/1iK5Kqx\n\nFollow us on facebook: http://facebook.com/BoredShortsTV\nFollow us on instagram: http://instagram.com/boredshortstv\n\nWe put microphones on a couple senior citizens and recorded their conversations, then asked children to re-enact it.

It's not much practice for playing longer portions, but luckily I've been saving this cover for just that! This song was one of the reasons I decided to do a third year of weekly covers along with I think Ecruteck. It's so beautiful and powerful, and also I think you guys might enjoy a time signature out of 4/4 for once! I spent most of my Final Fantasy time on this game since it was the only one I owned as a teenager (had the others when I was a kid still with my PS1) so you could say it really left an impact on me.\n\nAlas, I am once again unhappy with my tones. The issue with doing weekly vids along with full time school and everything on the side is that I don't get a lot of time to do what I call 'tone shoot-outs' where I just pick a bunch of tones and record over the same stuff and see which one I like best. This time I took the approach of only using one amp model for all the electric guitars. I think it worked in some ways but mostly didn't end up beneficial. I feel like it's so hard to get a lead tone that cuts without being too honky. One day, I'll have the perfect tone, one day. Just letting you all know who still despise my tones that I'm still working on it because I sure as hell aren't happy with them either. \n\nAll this twitch plays Pok\u00e9mon has gotten me back into the Pok\u00e9-guitar cover mood again!

You've isolated your nation. You've taken a nation of proud and honorable people, and you've made your country the pariah of the world. You've threatened countries with nuclear weapons. You've said you want a nuclear weapon. You've defied international accord. And you're slowly but surely isolating yourself.\" And secondly, that \"it's in your interest to have a unified nation on your border. It's in your interest that there be a flourishing democracy.\" And thirdly, you know, \"If we catch your people inside the country harming US citizens or Iraqi citizens, you know, we will deal with them.\" \n\nWhen Pelley tells President Ahmadinejad what President Bush said, he omits the sentences which expose Bush as dangerously ignorant of the basic facts.\n\nThis is Mainstream Media at its most devious, suppressing things from most of the people.

Symbolizing the toughness and persistence spirit of Hong Kong people, the Lion Rock is a famous Hong Kong hill located in Kowloon.

Andreas, one of the members of \u2018The Hong Kong Spidie\u2019 said, \u201cWe were shock by CY Leung\u2019s view point that the poor should not have equality in election, and hope this action would be able to call public attention on the importance of universal suffrage.\u2019\n\n\u2018The Hong Kong Spidie\u2019 planned this action a week ago, and spent a few hours this morning to climb up the Lion Rock and unfurled the banner. \u2018The Hong Kong Spidie\u2019 demands the Hong Kong \nSAR Government to listen to the voices of the Hong Kong people, to stand up and negotiate with the Chinese government on a true democratic universal suffrage for Hong Kong.", "title": "\u7345\u5b50\u5c71\u70ba\u57fa\u5c64\u6490\u8d77\u96e8\u5098  Up on the Lion Rock : Universal Suffrage for Hong Kong!", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T05:23:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gna7n7gGPA", "description": "", "title": "Tony Nuttall's ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE \u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0fxxx", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T11:29:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "1gnliH4zWkY", "description": "", "title": "cool ethan disciplines the disciplinarian", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T21:04:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "1go0XaCfXf0", "description": "These ten cute baby chickens were a bit of a surprise.

They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if necessary.

I am allowed to change my mind,\" whereupon she goes back to watching a days-long TV \"marathon\" which probably perpetuates the very ideology she's subject to.\n\nDespite what Ruby is forced to become under the black blood of Calvin's typewriter, Calvin's own capriciousness and despotism is never satisfied. Another author, a former fling, tells Calvin in a heated conversation, \"The only person you wanted to be in a relationship with was you. So I let you do that.\" Ruby Sparks, in this way, is merely Calvin's own onanistic or masturbatory projection.\n\nEventually, Ruby 'apologizes' to an enraged Calvin: \"I'm sorry I wasn't acting like the Platonic ideal of your girlfriend. Jesus, you can be such a fucking prude. [...] Because you don't want me doing *anything*. You have all these rules and you don't tell me what they are until, 'Woops!', I've broken one. And then you get to be disappointed with me. [...] Fuck you! I'm not your child! You don't get to decide what I do!\" Calvin, of course, as the 'author' of Ruby, can force her into any role he chooses. For me, this reflects the imposition of an identity which men have prescribed to women over millennia. What a woman's 'proper' role in a relationship is has changed over the centuries, from being literally the property of a man, just like his livestock or his house, after marriage, to being a maid or essentially a sex slave.\n\nRuby's own awakening, her realization that she's a mere representation of Calvin's desires, is a horrifying scene which must be watched, in the context of the film as a whole, to fully appreciate. This awakening reflects the awakening of women who demanded to be more than the slaves, the property of men, more than some \"Platonic ideal\" who'll strip on demand, or bark, or chant \"I love you. I'll never leave you. [...] I'll love you forever and ever and ever. You're a genius! You're a genius!\" Of course, women as early as Eve, or Helen of Troy, or Ophelia, demanded as much. And of course all three were blamed for the downfalls of men and/or subsequently murdered.\n\nIf \"Ruby Sparks\" is a depiction of the \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl,\" it is an absolute satire and denunciation of that idea, as opposed to some other movies, works of art, or literature, that take what the \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" embodies seriously.\n\nIn these ways, when Calvin first meets Ruby, he faces a crisis of recognizing that his dream clashes with reality which is why the moment in this video is hilarious in a couple of ways. His \"Platonic ideal,\" the woman that strips on command, actually is \"bat-shit,\" as he recognizes here, but Calvin deludes himself into believing otherwise.\n\nThough Calvin ostensibly learns his lesson by the end, I like the old idea of the tragedy and kinda wanted Calvin to be murdered or blinded and exiled or whatever. Otherwise, Kazan's insightful satire here, as well as the roles she's chosen to portray, reflect a mature recognition of the stereotypes which women today both face and fight against.", "title": "Ruby Sparks (2012) -- \"They're going to hospitalize me.

There are six to seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the Coscoroba Swan, although this species is no longer considered related to the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though 'divorce' does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure.

Flocks of these birds are found in grasslands, cultivated areas, scrub and secondary growth and they are best known for their hanging retort shaped nests woven from leaves. These nest colonies are usually found on thorny trees or palm fronds and the nests are often built near water or hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily. The breeding season of the Baya Weavers is during the monsoons. The breeding condition is initiated by environmental characters such as day length and comes to an end after summer although this termination is not influenced by short day length as in temperate birds. They nest in colonies typically of up to 20-30, close to the source of food, nesting material and water. Baya Weavers are best known for the elaborately woven nests constructed by the males. These pendulous nests are retort-shaped, with a central nesting chamber and a long vertical tube that leads to a side entrance to the chamber. The nests are woven with long strips of paddy leaves, rough grasses and long strips torn from palm fronds. Each strip can be between 20 and 60 cm in length. A male bird is known to make up to 500 trips to complete a nest. The birds use their strong beaks to strip and collect the strands, and to weave and knot them while building their nests. The nests are often built hanging over water from palm trees and often suspended from thorny Acacias and in some cases from telephone wires. Although the birds prefer thorny trees, they sometimes use avenue trees in urban areas.Nests are often located on the eastern side of the tree, where they are believed to provide shelter from the Southwest Monsoon; however, late breeders are more likely to build their nests in other orientations relative to the trunk of the nest tree.Abandoned nests are sometimes used by mice (Mus booduga)and other birds such as munias.Nests are built mainly in colonies but isolated nests are not unknown.Nests are often built from thorny Acacia or palm trees ( mainly Phoenix sylvestris and hang over open water.Young males may build experimental nests among reeds.In Burma, birds often build nests under the eaves of buildings, but this habit is uncommon in India. The males take about 18 days to construct the complete nest with the intermediate \"helmet stage\" taking about 8 days. The nests are partially built before the males begin to display to passing females by flapping their wings and calling while hanging from their nests. The females inspect the nest and signal their acceptance of a male. Once a male and a female are paired, the male goes on to complete the nest by adding the entrance tunnel. Males are almost solely in charge of nest building, though their female partners may join in giving the finishing touches, particularly on the interiors. Females may modify the interiors or add blobs of mud. A study has found that nest location is more important than nest structure for the female when it selects the nest and mate.Females prefer nests high in trees, those over dry land, and those on thin branches ,Both males and females are polygamous. Males build many partial nests and begin courting females. The male finishes the nest only after finding a mate. The female lays about 2 to 4 white eggs and incubates them for about 14 to 17 days.Males may sometimes assist in feeding the chicks. The chicks leave the nest after about 17 days. After mating with a female the male typically court other females at other partially constructed nests. Intraspecific brood parasitism is known, that is, females may lay their eggs in the nests of others.Young birds leave the nest in a juvenal plumage which is replaced in their first moult after about four to six months. The young disperse to new locations not far from their nest and young have been located up to two kilometres away from their origin.Females are capable of breeding after a year while males take half a year longer. Prior to breeding they go through a prenuptial moult. Adults also go through a second moult after breeding and thus there are two moults each year. Histochemical studies have shown increased lipid metabolism in the crown region of male Baya during the breeding season. Lipids are known to be involved in the transport of the yellow carotenoid pigments that form the crown and are subsequently metabolized.he nest, being suspended from thorny trees and overhanging water, is protected from many predators, but nest predation by crows is not unusual. Brood may also be destroyed by lizards such as Calotes versicolor or rodents such as Vandeleuria oleracea which may take over the nest. Nests may sometimes be taken over and used for nesting by Indian Silverbills.", "title": "Nesting of Indian Baya Weaver  Birds  In Melghat Video by Shirishkumar Patil", "publishedDate": "2011-03-10T11:28:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1hVQTC5xxEs", "description": "En fasantupp ropar med upprepade l\u00e4ten i en tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rd i s\u00f6dra Sverige den 5 juli 2014.", "title": "Common pheasant calling with quick repeated sounds", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T06:01:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1hVRGpcQlAQ", "description": "Motor brushless reciclado de un disco duro, tiene mejores prestaciones que el motor sacado de un lector de CD/D/DVD.

Billy zit op boksen, maar belandt toevallig in een balletles. Tot zijn eigen verbazing blijkt hij hiervoor talent te hebben. Tegen de wil van zijn vader in gaat hij, onder begeleiding van zijn fanatieke balletdocente, steeds harder trainen. Uiteindelijk mag hij auditie doen voor de Royal Ballet School in Londen. Billy hoopt zijn droom om danser te kunnen worden te verwezenlijken, hetgeen hem thuis grote problemen oplevert. Want wat is belangrijker?

A local journalist is reported to have been injured during the dispersal. A group of girls from the Ukrainian FEMEN movement gathered in front of the Georgian embassy in Kiev on Monday, holding huge fake cameras and posters saying \"No pictures -- no democracy!\" During the protest, which was meant as part of an international campaign backing the Georgian photo journalists recently arrested on espionage charges, a man emerged from the embassy and attacked first the topless activists, and then one of the journalists who was taking photos of the event. The attacker turned out to be one of the embassy employees. The correspondent, from the local Kommentarii newspaper, Aleksandr Yamkovoy, was injured as the embassy employee hit him hard on the head. He was taken to hospital. According to FEMEN activists, the actions taken by the Georgian embassy only prove \"the international community's suspicions that official Tbilisi is media-phobic.\" \"Members of the embassy demonstrated a lack of respect for all democratic values: freedom of speech, freedom of association. Thus we are even more worried about the journalists who were arrested in Georgia,\" stated the FEMEN activists. Four Georgian photographers, including a photographer with the presidential administration's press service, Irakly Gedenidze, and his wife Natiya, were charged with espionage on July 9. Natiya Gedenidze was later released on bail. The other detainees are Zurab Kurtsikidze, a representative of the European Press Photo Agency (EPA), and Georgy Abdaladze, a photographer for the Foreign Ministry who was also working with the Associated Press.\nRT on Twitter: http://twitter.com/RT_com\nRT on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/RTnews", "title": "Topless Travesty: Video of Femen protests taking a beating", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T14:51:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "1he2dUT6UrA", "description": "Hey guys, i'm Penncil or Danick and i'm a OG trickshotter on Playstation 3.

In comparison with the previous fighters, the MiG-29K/KUB flight hours are increased more than twice, but a flight hour cost is reduced about 2.5 times. The MiG-29K/KUB fighters operate without overhaul.\n\nThe power plant includes two engines RD-33MK with increased thrust power, equipped with smokeless combustion chamber and new electronic control system (of FADEC type). Engines are of the module structure and have increased reliability and service life.\n\nThe airborne avionics is of the open architecture based on MIL-STD-1553B standard.\n\nThe fighter has multi-role, multi-mode \"pulse-Doppler\" type radar \"Zhuk-ME\" manufactured by \"Fazotron-NIIP\" Corporation. The radar is provided with the slot array. As compared with radars of the previous generation, \"Zhuk-ME\" has wider scanning angle in azimuth, twice longer target detection range, less weight and increased reliability. \"Zhuk-ME\" provides tracking up to 10 air targets with four targets simultaneous firing with missiles.\n\nThe MiG-29K/KUB fighters are equipped with state-of-the-art multi-channel IRST with target designation system to the anti-radar passive war-head missiles.\n\nThere is the possibility of installation on aircraft of IR and laser sighting equipment pods for ground targets illumination.\n\nAvionics' open architecture allows installation on aircraft of new equipment and weapons of Russian and foreign origin upon customer's request.\n\nThe MiG-29K/KUB fighters are equipped with the built-in automated integrated system \"Karat\" of serviceability check and data recording, video-recorder, computer-aided flight mission recording into the airborne radio-electronic system as well as airborne autonomous power generation station used for the equipment ground checks without main engines starting-up.\n\nWeapons system includes \"A-A\", \"A-S\" missiles, guided aerial bombs, rockets, aerial bombs and built-in air-gun of 30 mm caliber. Upon request of the customer the new types of weapons can be applied.\n\nBoth the single and double seat versions of aircraft have the same airborne equipment and weapons as well as the high unification level of structure.\n\nFor the MiG-29K/KUB fighters the full set of training means was developed including the full mission simulator with the motion system.\n\nThe MiG-29KUB aircraft first flight took place in January 2007.\n\nThe MiG-29K/KUB fighters are in production under order of the Indian Navy.", "title": "United Aircraft Corporation - MiG-29K/KUB Fulcrum-D Carrier-Based

At this point, do we really think we're preparing our students for the breathtaking ride that is the arc of human achievement and innovation in the 21st Century? The problem is not teachers. Our teachers are doing an incredible job, working within an outdated model. \n\nRenowned educator and philosopher John Dewey once said, \"If we teach today's students as we taught yesterday's, we rob them of tomorrow.\" That was in 1944.\n\nWe've established the problem. What's the solution? Start over? No. There is no one perfect answer yet, but there are a lot of possibilities. Those of us who are asking the question are thrilled with these possibilities. At Jacksonville State University in Alabama, we are passionate about transforming education from Pre-K all the way through college. We have established CORE, Collaborative Regional Education partners, which introduces new technologies and methodologies to high-need schools. \n\nBut there's a lot more to it than sticking an iPad in a kid's hands and hailing it a groundbreaking approach. After all, technology in classrooms is nothing new. It's just a tool that, when combined with a project and challenge-based learning approach, promotes 21st Century critical thinking skills. Essentially, it's teaching kids to solve problems now, in the same way adults solve them everyday. CORE began as a spark that has found its fuel in the fertile minds of the educators in our area, getting the attention of the U.S. Department of Education, which recently awarded JSU a $11.6 million i3 (Investing in Innovation) grant. This will enable CORE to form new partnerships in the schools and in communities, study and assess our progress, and, in the future, include thousands, and then hundreds of thousands of school students nationwide. \n\nFor more information about CORE, visit http://www.corepartners.org\n\nhttp://www.jsu.edu", "title": "Innovation in Education Through CORE", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T15:13:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1hpHySiUAfg", "description": "One of my favourite gags on the show...and I couldnt find it anywhere!

A powered exoskeleton, also known as powered armor, exoframe, or exosuit, is a mobile machine consisting primarily of an outer framework (akin to an insect's exoskeleton) worn by a person, and powered by a system of motors or hydraulics that delivers at least part of the energy for limb movement.\n\nThe main function of a powered exoskeleton is to assist the wearer by boosting their strength and endurance. They are commonly designed for military use, to help soldiers carry heavy loads both in and out of combat. In civilian areas, similar exoskeletons could be used to help firefighters and other rescue workers survive dangerous environments.[1] The medical field is another prime area for exoskeleton technology, where it can be used for enhanced precision during surgery,[citation needed] or as an assist to allow nurses to move heavy patients.[2]\n\nWorking prototypes of powered exoskeletons, including XOS[3] by Sarcos, and HULC[4] by Lockheed Martin (both meant for military use), have been constructed but have not yet been deployed in the field. Several companies have also created exosuits for medical use,[5] including the HAL 5 by Cyberdyne Inc.\n\nAn electric powered leg exoskeleton developed at MIT reduces the metabolic energy used when walking and carrying a load.[6] The exoskeleton augments human walking by providing mechanical power to the ankle joints.\n\nEkso Bionics is currently developing and manufacturing intelligently powered exoskeleton bionic devices that can be strapped on as wearable robots to enhance the strength, mobility, and endurance of soldiers and paraplegics.\n\nVarious problems remain to be solved, the most daunting being the creation of a compact power supply powerful enough to allow an exoskeleton to operate for extended periods without being plugged into external power.[7]\n\nA fictional mech(a) is different from a powered exoskeleton in that a mecha is typically much larger than a normal human body and does not directly enhance the motion or strength of the physical limbs. Instead, the human operator occupies a cabin or pilot's control seat inside a small portion of the larger system. Within this cabin the human may wear a small lightweight exoskeleton that serves as a haptic control interface for the much larger exterior appendages.\n\nApplications\nOne of the proposed main uses for an exoskeleton would be enabling a soldier to carry heavy objects (80\u2013300 kg) while running or climbing stairs. Not only could a soldier potentially carry more weight, he could presumably wield heavier armor and weapons. Most models use a hydraulic system controlled by an on-board computer. They could be powered by an internal combustion engine, batteries or potentially fuel cells. Another area of application could be medical care, nursing in particular. Faced with the impending shortage of medical professionals and the increasing number of people in elderly care, several teams of Japanese engineers have developed exoskeletons designed to help nurses lift and carry patients.\n\nExoskeletons could also be applied in the area of rehabilitation of stroke or Spinal cord injury patients. Such exoskeletons are sometimes also called Step Rehabilitation Robots. An exo-skeleton could reduce the number of therapists needed by allowing even the most impaired patient to be trained by one therapist, whereas several are currently needed. Also training could be more uniform, easier to analyze retrospectively and can be specifically customized for each patient. At this time there are several projects designing training aids for rehabilitation centers (LOPES exoskeleton, Lokomat, ALTACRO and the gait trainer, Hal 5.)\n\nExoskeletons could also be regarded as wearable robots: A wearable robot is a mechatronic system that is designed around the shape and function of the human body, with segments and joints corresponding to those of the person it is externally coupled with. Teleoperation and power amplification were said to be the first applications, but after recent technological advances the range of application fields is said to have widened. Increasing recognition from the scientific community means that this technology is now employed in telemanipulation, man-amplification, neuromotor control research and rehabilitation, and to assist with impaired human motor control (Wearable Robots: Biomechatronic Exoskeletons).[14]\n\nCurrent products\nReWalk: ReWalk features powered hip and knee motion to enable those with lower limb disabilities, including paraplegia as a result of spinal cord injury (SCI), to perform self-initiated standing, walking, and stair ascending/ descending.\nSarcos/Raytheon XOS Exoskeleton arms/legs.
