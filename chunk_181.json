Robert Anthony\n- Tanya Lee\n\nThe meaning of theterm genre is the category of artistic composition, as in music or literature, marked by a distinctive style, form, or content. While this has its depths within a distinct example of music, Chiron is a band that cannot be bound by genre. Formed in 1997 by vocalist Michael Aliani after he left popular Australian Gothic ban Ikon, the original lineup included Dino Molinaro (bass) Shura b2 (Guiter) and Vadim Belakov (Drums). Over the years this line up has changed numerous times, but one consistency has remained throughout, being the voice of Michael Aliani. Chiron has become the vessel for Michael to produce truly unique music and work with an array of different musicians and producers. Originally a dark wave band, Chiron entered the new millennium fresh with new ideas and an opportunity to take its music far deeper than before. The transformation began with the meeting of lead singer Michael Aliani and DJ/producer Robert Anthony, and the subsequent collaboration with Melbourne DJ/Producer Murray Van Zaff . What was once a solid dark wave band, Chiron was soon to be exposed to the sounds of trip hop, ambient breaks and even hard trance. These collaborations brought upon some early success through a number of dance remixed releases on vinyl and compilation CDs. The first release on the MTM label 'MTMR001 Extra Phenomena EP' topped as the 7th bestseller for TuneInn.com in its first week of sale, and was regarded as having a truely original Melbourne sound in the genre of electronica. Chiron then took part in an Australian tour, whilst spending as much time as possible refining their sound, which if genre were necessary, electronica. From large rave festivals to small intimate gatherings, Chiron continued to push the endless boundaries. While the large rave festivals exposed Chiron to a younger market, it is the intimate shows that allow the group to be free with its material, often described as an emotional melody with rhythm and urgency. \"Slipping Away'' (Apollyon/Alive Apo CD 25062) is a perfect example of this intimacy, but also features the future of Chiron with 'Far From Me' being the most demanded songs at their festival appearances. This version also featured in the German Electronic Web Charts for July, 2005. Most recently Michael has begun to work with vocalist Tanya Lee. Her ability to capture the emotion of each composition cannot be understated.

But now the unique flower tops the list for the most popular on the market for so much more than special occasions.Behind a sign promising a greenhouse open to orchid enthusiasts, is a story generations long. Scott McCandless tends the greenhouses for Lines Orchids on Signal Mountain, that began as a labor of love for his great-grandfather Oliver Lines. Just playing out here and I'd follow in his footsteps, McCandless says. That orchid obsession began in England, and brought the family to Signal, where conditions for the flowers are pretty close to perfection. Up here it's a little bit cooler you get more of a breeze, McCandless explains. It's a much better climate.What the mountain can't maintain, electricity provides so the orchids, once only coveted for corsages, can flourish by the tens of thousands in their vivid, vintage environment. Through breeding, people can make the flowers bigger and change the colors and the thickness, McCandless says. The substance can be different, whether some have a slight fragrance or not, there are sort of like endless possibilities.When the crossing and pollination of the now favorite flower are done, McCandless keeps up with the young plants,  as they outgrow their pots and waits for the magic of Mother Nature. Until they bloom you just don't know what they are going to look like, the fourth-generation grower says.Most orchids take about three years of tender, loving care before they're ready for retail, or your visit to this Signal Mountain staple. A lot of places, like the big box stores, their orchids are nice but you miss the experience, McCandless says. To go to where they are grown, I think that's the neat thing about being here. You get to see the whole process not just buy the end product.Lines' biggest customers are florists in Nashville, Birmingham and Atlanta, but you can also buy their blooms at their retail location in Warehouse Row and, of course, at their greenhouse on Taft Highway.For more information on Lines Orchids, click here to visit their website.\nBy: Latricia Thomas", "title": "Tens of Thousands of Orchids \"Made\" on Signal Mountain", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T23:03:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "APnzhb3evSc", "description": "I do not own the rights to this song.\n\nLyrics\n\nI'm Sitting On Top Of The World\n\nI'm sitting on top of the world,\nJust rolling along, just rolling along.\nI'm quitting the blues of the world,\nJust singing a song, just singing a song.\n\nGlory, hallelujah, I just phoned the parson,\n\"Hey, Par, get ready to call!\"\nJust like humpty dumpty,\nI'm ready to fall.\n\nI'm sitting on top of the world,\nJust rolling along, just rolling along.\nI'm quitting the blues of the world,\nJust singing a song, just singing a song", "title": "Dean Martin - I'm sitting on top of the world", "publishedDate": "2009-09-30T11:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "APoAPbUl4fc", "description": "Remake of Outkast and Obadiah Parker", "title": "Hey Ya Acoustic (Obadiah Parker)", "publishedDate": "2010-10-03T18:00:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "APoMWwkOj7Y", "description": "Challah", "title": "Hafrashat Challah with Anat 3", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T06:21:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "APobo1mCJoU", "description": "Anwar El Ghazi scoorde in Camp Nou namens Ajax tegen FC Barcelona en dat kunstje hoopt de buitenspeler woensdagavond te herhalen.

Then 25mL of 15M nitric acid (~70%) is added. The mixture is gently heated to near boiling. The acid will bubble as it reacts. Chemical gas bubbling like this looks more like fizzing and is distinct from boiling. When the bubbling almost stops (~4 hours) add another 25mL of nitric acid. Repeat as necessary. The dissolution is very slow and may take days for a compact bar of platinum. This reaction is usually much quicker for small bits of platinum scrap or powder.

Tennis backhands, there are two different types. We're going to talk about the two-hander, not the one-hander. The two-handed backhand means just that. You're going to have both hands on the grip, and you're going to swing with both arms, not just with one. Kirk is going to demonstrate the type of swing, and I'm going to tell you then what the reason for using a two-handed backhand would be.\n\nKirk, he has both hands on the grip, notice. And when he turns, he's going to switch the grip from a forehand grip or an Eastern or semi-western to a backhand grip, which means he's going to slide it to his left on top of the racquet a little bit, the right hand. The left hand just grips the racquet in a normal, Eastern grip style. He's going to turn his hips and shoulders. He's going to take a step into the court. Both hands are going to come through the swing, and the dominant hand for a two-handed backhand is the left arm, Kirk's less dominant arm when he's naturally playing tennis. He's a right-handed player, but a two-handed backhand uses the left arm.\n\nHe's going to drive through the shot, through the ball, with a slightly closed face, with his left arm and right arm but the left arm being dominant. And he's going to finish over his right shoulder, showing the butt cap. I like to say that. Show the butt cap like a flashlight. So again, Kirk's going to have both hands on the grip. He's going to switch the grip slightly, racquet raised so he can do a little loop, comes underneath the ball, brushes up, drives through with the left hand, and finishes over his right shoulder. That's a two-handed backhand.\n\nNow, why a two-handed backhand? A lot of players grow up playing tennis when they're very young. They start sometimes five or six, and the only way to hit a backhand when you're five or six effectively is to use two hands. So they grow up playing that way, and they continue to. It can be a very effective shot, because you can get a lot of power when you're young. You can get a lot more power when you're old. Not that a one-hander doesn't have power, but a two-hander can get a lot of power when they're younger. Also two hands are known to have the ability to disguise their shots well, because they can use a little bit more wrist because they've got this other hand helping. Two hands has disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is you can't reach out for a ball that's wide. You have to let go. So a two-hander has to have good feet to get to balls so they can hit the ball in position.\n\nKirk Moritz:  Sounds good to me, Joe. With those two hands, make sure that both hands are relaxed. You could be twice as tight on the two-handed backhand and lose some of the fluidity. So you want your hands relaxed. Feel your fingertips on the racquet so you can accelerate that swing and brush up just like you do on the forehand. Soft hands. Hold the racquet looser than you think you're supposed to.\n\nJoe:  And that's a two-handed backhand in tennis.", "title": "How to Do a Two-Handed Backhand | Tennis Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-08-12T06:27:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQ4g4XVKK40", "description": "27.06.2014, pub \u017belazna (Rybnik)\nPierwsze publiczne wykonanie nowej wersji naszego szlagiera \"Prosiak4life\" \\m/.

Mientras las sociedades subdesarrolladas tienden a las dietas vegetales, conforme aumenta el nivel de vida tambi\u00e9n lo hace el consumo de alimentos de origen animal. Pero lo que parece claro es que todas las personas deber\u00edan consumir m\u00e1s fruta y hortalizas, especialmente en pa\u00edses en los que, como Espa\u00f1a, el desarrollo ha supuesto una modificaci\u00f3n importante de los h\u00e1bitos alimentarios.El consumo diario de productos vegetales, en cantidad suficiente y en una alimentaci\u00f3n bien equilibrada, ayuda a evitar enfermedades graves, como las cardiopat\u00edas, los accidentes cardiovasculares, la diabetes y el c\u00e1ncer, as\u00ed como deficiencias de importantes micronutrientes y vitaminas. La Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) coloca el escaso consumo de fruta y hortalizas en sexto lugar entre los 20 factores de riesgo a los que atribuye la mortalidad humana, inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de otros m\u00e1s conocidos, como el tabaco y el colesterol.\n\nEl consumo mundial de fruta y hortalizas est\u00e1 muy por debajo de los 400 gramos diarios por persona. Esto se debe a que en los \u00faltimos 50 a\u00f1os ha disminuido el consumo de cereales y leguminosas, se ha incrementado el de los aceites vegetales, el az\u00facar y la carne, mientras que la fruta y las hortalizas apenas han aumentado. Se estima que en todo el mundo la gente s\u00f3lo consume entre el 20% y el 50% del m\u00ednimo recomendado.\nEs necesario controlar la alimentaci\u00f3n desde el punto de la calidad y variedad de alimentos y nutrientes Ante esta situaci\u00f3n, la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n (FAO), junto con las autoridades sanitarias de la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses, est\u00e1n intentando modificar, en la medida de lo posible, los h\u00e1bitos de los consumidores. El objetivo es disminuir las enfermedades que se vislumbran dominantes en este siglo, es decir, las derivadas de una mala alimentaci\u00f3n, y lo ha hecho con una perspectiva sanitaria claramente diferente a otras \u00e9pocas. Por una parte, se ha conseguido controlar gran parte de las enfermedades que en siglos anteriores han sido responsables de grandes mortandades. El c\u00f3lera ya no es un problema en nuestras latitudes, ha desaparecido la peste y enfermedades como la tuberculosis o las fiebres de malta no son lo que eran hace 80 a\u00f1os.\n\nEsto se ha debido, entre otras cosas, a las medidas aplicadas en el \u00e1mbito de la seguridad alimentaria y a los avances de la medicina. La consecuencia se est\u00e1 poniendo claramente de manifiesto. Los avances en medicina y en prevenci\u00f3n, hasta hoy fundamentalmente en los campos de la veterinaria y de la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda de los alimentos, nos han llevado a permitir una expectativa de vida muy considerable. No obstante, esto no supone una panacea, ya que estamos viendo que una vez controlados estos problemas surge la necesidad de controlar la alimentaci\u00f3n desde el punto de vista de la calidad y variedad de alimentos y nutrientes.\n\nLa nueva frontera en alimentaci\u00f3n deber\u00eda garantizar de nuevo alimentos m\u00e1s seguros y saludables. Para ello, parece necesario disminuir el consumo de productos animales de forma progresiva e incluir, quiz\u00e1s en un futuro, el pescado salvaje para incrementar de forma significativa el consumo de todos los vegetales, especialmente frutas, verduras y leguminosas.\nQuiz\u00e1s debido a prejuicios culturales que se han ido generando, y a la b\u00fasqueda de productos f\u00e1ciles de consumir, agradables al gusto y con una manipulaci\u00f3n m\u00ednima, se ha subestimado la importancia de la fruta y las hortalizas para la nutrici\u00f3n y la salud en general. Por ejemplo, la fruta requiere ser comprada, transportada y manipulada. Normalmente hay que pelarla, cortarla y prepararla, mientras que un postre l\u00e1cteo s\u00f3lo requiere abrir la tapa y consumirlo. Esto supone una clara desventaja, ya que esa b\u00fasqueda de la comodidad se ha introducido en nuestra sociedad de forma imparable.\n\nConforme se acelera la transici\u00f3n alimentaria hacia alimentos con gran contenido de grasas y az\u00facar en todo el mundo, muy agradables al paladar, con texturas blandas, como la boller\u00eda o los alimentos preparados listos al uso, tipo snacks, existe el peligro de que la fruta y las hortalizas queden marginadas en la alimentaci\u00f3n de las personas. Entonces \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no se consume m\u00e1s fruta y hortalizas?", "title": "Leche de almendras opcion para intolerantes a la lactosa", "publishedDate": "2014-03-02T09:53:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQDReBpfjuo", "description": "After a 2 year break, Vegas Nerve return to a music venue near you", "title": "Vegas Nerve are BACK!!", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T19:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQF2UaJ-E9E", "description": "Australia- 2010 - Brisbane - S.E.Queensland - Deception bay", "title": "Grey tailed Tattler - Siberische Grijze Ruiter", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T09:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQF7pXmy8hE", "description": "Ticci Toby model - AuraandAxz\nTicci Toby Story - Kastoway (formaly known as fatal-impurity )\n\nJeff the Killer model - pinkwormy \n\nSlenderman model - i think its Pocket-Vocaloid ??? -got it from some YouTube but it looks like Pocket-Vocaloids model style but has no readme to give proper credit-\n\nSong and Dance (man) (not really) - Wonderful!

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "ECU vs Virginia Tech | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-09-13T21:01:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQKU_r1u1uI", "description": "In this video, I show you how to clean the Breville Espresso Machine.

It is one of a number which feature only a single animal protagonist. (Other examples include The Cock and the Jewel.) A fox, upon failing to find a way to reach grapes hanging high up on a vine, retreated and said: \"The grapes are sour anyway!\"\n\n\nAesop's Fables or Aesopica refers to a collection of fables credited to a slave and story-teller who lived in Ancient Greece between 620 and 560 BC. Aesop's Fables have become a blanket term for collections of brief fables, especially beast fables involving anthropomorphic animals. His fables are some of the most well known in the world. The fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as The Fox and the Grapes (from which the idiom \"sour grapes\" was derived), The Tortoise and the Hare, The North Wind and the Sun, The Boy Who Cried Wolf and The Ant and the Grasshopper are well-known throughout the world.\n\nFrank Tashlin adapted the tale into a 1941 Color Rhapsodies short for Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures. The Fox and the Grapes marked the first appearance of Screen Gems' most popular characters, The Fox and the Crow. The Electric Company adapted the fable as one of the \"Very Short Book\" series; in only a few pages and words it sums up the fable exactly as written, with the fox saying \"I'll bet they're sour!\"\n\nThe fable illustrates the concept of cognitive dissonance, which occurs when a person tries to hold incompatible ideas simultaneously. Dissonance is reduced by altering one of the belief or desire states, even if it leads to irrational behavior.", "title": "Aesop's Fable 'Sour Grapes'", "publishedDate": "2010-01-25T02:50:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQWKZUD5dr0", "description": "On the second day of the Around Ireland Rally 2008 we paid a visit to Mizen Head, the most southwesterly point of Ireland, where we found this bridge amidst gorgeous scenery.

The basic story remains unchanged. Two very small children, a boy and a girl, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island. They are cared for by fellow castaway Leo McKern. When he dies, the kids, played with a minimum of clothing by Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, have no one but each other. When they grow into teen-hood, they also fall madly in love. Heavily reshaped and reedited before its release, The Blue Lagoon's principal attribute is the lush photography by Nestor Almendros. In 1990, a sequel was made, Return to the Blue Lagoon.\n\n\"the blue lagoon\",\"the blue lagoon clip\",\"the blue lagoon full movie\",\"the blue lagoon part 1\",\"the blue lagoon trailer\",\"the blue lagoon part 10\",\"the blue lagoon part 8 movie\",\"the blue lagoon part 7\",\"brooke shields\",\"christopher atkins\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"randal kleiser\",\"discovery videos\",\"frustration videos\",\"innocence videos\",\"island videos\",richard,emmeline,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++6267,/m/01w2msg,/m/0bx_q", "title": "The Blue Lagoon (6/8) Movie CLIP - Not in the Mood (1980) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T20:58:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQ_OBYNlNS0", "description": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a5f\u6750\u2193(Equipment use)\n\nGuitar \u30fb 1976 Greco Stratocaster MOD(Super Sound for PROTO)\nGuitar Pickups\u3000\u30fb\u3000Bridge PU( Seymour Duncan\u300cJB Jr\u300d)\u3000center PU( DiMarzio HS-3\uff09\u3000front PU(DIMARZIO DP217 YJM\u2122\uff09\n\nCABLE \u30fb MONSTER CABLE MONSTER ROCK\nEFFECTOR CABLE \u30fb GEORGE L'SGL'S 155 RED\n\nAMP \u30fb CRATE Power Block CPB150\nAMP Setting \u30fb Clean Sound Setting(Treble&LOW&MID\u3000 EQ ALL Flat) \nSpeaker cabinet \u30fb ADA Stackable 12(80s Vintage Electro Voice EVM12L )\n\nEFECTER \u30fb Guyatone PHASE SHIFTER PS2&Marshall eh-1 echohead\n\n\n\u9332\u97f3\u6a5f\u6750(Recording equipment) \u30fb ZOOM Q3HD(Auto mode)\n\nhttp://anaheim-electronics.co.jp/nmfx/index.html", "title": "Noisemaker FX CRUSH FUZZ", "publishedDate": "2012-02-20T16:03:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "AQ_fSDouaVw", "description": "!

I followed the path that most people who suffer with eczema tend to go through. I went to a dermatologist who ran blood and allergy tests on Lilly, but the tests were not able to tell me for definite as to what was causing Lilly's condition.\n\nEczema is a horrible condition for anyone to suffer with. It is even harder for a child. Try explaning to a child why they cannot scratch at the constant itching, and why they have to be covered with thick oily creams on a daily basis, and you will know what I am talking about.\n\nIt was only when I started to look at a more natural eczema cure, that I started to find cases of people that had moved away from medications, and started to control their symptoms by using natural eczema treatments to Beat Eczema.

Its not harming to the infant at all as long as you drain it every 3 or 4 hours and apply eye/ear drops, I dont recall what kind, if you need to know, ask your family doctor.

They are superficially similar to swallows, but are not closely related to passerine species. Swifts are placed in the order Apodiformes, which they share with hummingbirds. The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.\nResemblances between swifts and swallows are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles based on catching insects in flight.\nThe family scientific name comes from the Ancient Greek \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, apous, meaning \"without feet\", since swifts have very short legs and rarely ever settle voluntarily on the ground, clinging instead to vertical surfaces. The tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle Ages, as seen in the heraldic martlet.Swifts are the most aerial of birds. Larger species are amongst the fastest fliers in the animal kingdom, with the White-throated Needletail having been reported flying at up to 169 km/h[1] (105 mph). Even the Common Swift can cruise at a maximum speed of 31 metres per second (112 km/h, 70 mph). In a single year the common swift can cover at least 200,000 km. Compared with typical birds, swiftlet wings have proportionately large wingtip bones. By changing the angle between the wingtip bones and the forelimb bones, they are able to alter the shape and area of their wings, maximizing their efficiency and maneuverability at various speeds.[3] With the exception from their relatives the hummingbirds, they are also unique among birds in being able to rotate their wings from the base, a trait that allows the wing to remain rigid and fully extended and derive power on both upstroke and downstroke. In other birds, the upstroke is a passive stroke used to lift the wing into position.Swifts occur on all the continents, though not in the far north or large deserts, and on many oceanic islands.[6] The swifts of temperate regions are strongly migratory and winter in the tropics. Some species can survive short periods of cold weather by entering torpor, a state similar to hibernation.Many have a characteristic shape, with a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The flight of some species is characterised by a distinctive \"flicking\" action quite different from swallows. Swifts range in size from the Pygmy Swiftlet (Collocalia troglodytes), which weighs 5.4 g and measures 9 cm (3.7 inches) long, to the Purple Needletail (Hirundapus celebensis), which weighs 184 g (6.5 oz) and measures 25 cm (10 inches) long.[5]\nThe nest of many species is glued to a vertical surface with saliva, and the genus Aerodramus use only that substance, which is the basis for bird's nest soup. The eggs hatch after 19 to 23 days, and the young leave the nest after a further six to eight weeks. Both parents assist in raising the young.Swifts and treeswifts have long been considered to be relatives of the hummingbirds, a judgement corroborated by the discovery of the Jungornithidae, which were apparently swift-like hummingbird relatives, and of primitive hummingbirds such as Eurotrochilus. Traditional taxonomies place the hummingbird family (Trochilidae) in the same order as the swifts and treeswifts (and no other birds); the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy treated this group as a superorder in which the swift order was called Trochiliformes.The Apodiformes diversified during the Eocene, at the end of which the extant families were present; fossil genera are known from all over temperate Europe, between today's Denmark and France, such as the primitive Scaniacypselus (Early - Middle Eocene) and the more modern Procypseloides (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene - Early Miocene). A prehistoric genus sometimes assigned to the swifts, Primapus (Early Eocene of England), might also be a more distant ancestor.The taxonomy of the swifts is in general complicated, with genus and species boundaries widely disputed, especially amongst the swiftlets. Analysis of behavior and vocalizations is complicated by common parallel evolution, while analyses of different morphological traits and of various DNA sequences have yielded equivocal and partly contradictory results (Thomassen et al., 2005).(Phys.org) \u2014A combined team of researchers from Bern University and the Swiss Ornithological Institute has found that alpine swifts are able to fly for up to 200 days at a time, without landing. The team learned of the bird's unique abilities to fly for such long stretches by attaching tiny sensors to several migrating specimens. They have published the results of their findings in the journal Nature Communications.", "title": "Activity of Swift in air Video", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T18:26:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARXSnu8ImqQ", "description": "Iodine is a solid which turns to a purple vapour when heated.

You'll know you are hitting it because blood will spray out and your weapon won't be rebounding off his fatty tissue. Wield your weapon with two hands, as he'll probably one-hit you anyway. Stay close to him and keep moving to the right, when he starts his swipe his left hand will move and allow you to get away.

Muslim Men Go Crazy\n\nWhat would happen if the women of Iran, Afghanistan & Saudi Arabia simultaneously removed their face veils in an iconic rejection of the totalitarian control of personal behavior?\n\nMuslim women who flout the onerous enforcement of the face veil have suffered acid attacks, beatings and even murder.\n\nHumanitarian and feminist groups have completely failed to take a stand, fearing the issue is politically incorrect.\n\nBurqa liberation day may be a controversial, perilous and quixotic concept, but deep seated despotism has never been stifled and eviscerated without men and women first daring to dream of dangerous ideas. Why I, as a Muslim, am launching a campaign to ban the burka in Britain\n\n    Dr Taj Hargey is the Imam of the Oxford Islamic Congregation and the Director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford The increasing fashion for young Muslim women in Britain to wear the burka (in contrast to their mothers, who do not) is one of most sinister developments of our times.\n\nSupporters of this garment like to pretend that it is a welcome symbol of our society\u2019s multicultural diversity and philosophical tolerance. But such warped thinking is woefully misguided. In reality, the burka is an archaic tribal piece of cloth that is eagerly used by fundamentalist zealots to promote a toxic brand of extremist non-Koranic theology.\n\nEveryone in Britain, including Muslims, should oppose the insidious spread of this vile piece of clothing, which imprisons women, threatens social harmony, fuels distrust, has grave health implications and is a potent security risk. muslim burka security test challenge \"security guard\" research protest race australia religion fight battle \"middle east\" free freedom liberty control anger \"anger management\" police cops media newspaper law lawyer \"law and order\" society social \"social experiment\" australian citizen citizenship 2014 humanity bank shopping \"shopping mall\" truth agenda elite trending entertainment trendy comedy prank \"elite nwo agenda\" alex jones infowars gerald celente rant crazy riots war iraq ebola demcad jsnip4 bilderberg coast to coast am louis farrakhan\n\nA key part of the impetus for this move came from the decision of the European Court of Human Rights this month to uphold the ban instituted by the French Government in 2010 on all face coverings in public. Supported by lawyers from Birmingham, a 24-year-old French woman of Pakistani origin took her well-funded case to the ECHR, claiming that the ban was a violation of her  \u2014 and note the sequence \u2014  religious, cultural and personal rights.\n\nOn every level, this questionable appeal relied on distortions and untruths. Thankfully her case was thrown out, but her arguments illustrate the chronic weakness of any suggestion that we must allow the burka to be worn in public.\n\nFirst, there is no religious requirement on Muslims to don the burka; second, the burka is not a feature of Pakistani culture, where 90 per cent of women do not wear it; third, there is no unqualified human right to wear whatever we want in public. In every developed society, personal freedoms have to take account of wider social mores.\n\nThe French ban has proved to be legally sound as well as sensible. I have long believed that the same measure should be introduced here in the UK to prevent community separatism and social apartheid. And, like the ECHR, I see no basis for the pretence that there is any religious sanction for the burka.\n\nThe wearing of the face mask is a custom originating in ancient Persia and Byzantium, more than 1,000 years before the birth of Islam. It was upheld by male aristocrats because of social snobbery rather than religion, since they did not want their womenfolk \u2014 wives, daughters, sisters or mothers \u2014 to be seen by the peasantry.", "title": "SOCIAL EXPERIMENT - Non Muslim Men Wear a Burka to Test Security Protocols.

Factory panhard bars are made with small diameter tubing and rubber bushings that allow deflection under load.\n\nBMR panhard bars are all made from larger diameter 1.25\", heavy wall DOM tubing and utilize either greaseable polyurethane bushings or HD spherical bearings by QA1. The adjustable versions use left-hand and right-hand thread to allow easy \"on-car\" adjustment. The CNC machined adjusters are made from 4130 chrom-moly and have rolled threads. All rod end spacers are 304 stainless. You won't find better quality pieces.\n\nBy nature, a panhard bar will alter rear end position as ride height changes. This makes it necessary to use an adjustable panhard bar when lowering your vehicle as it allows you to re-center the rear end. Adjustable panhard bars also become a \"must-have\" part if you are trying to fit the widest tires possible in the wheel well.\n\nSee more 2005-2014 Mustang Panhard Bars:\nhttp://www.cjponyparts.com/2005-2009-mustang-panhard-bars/c/40170260/\n\nSee more parts from BMR Suspension:\nhttp://www.cjponyparts.com/bmr/c/8_1001_25/", "title": "Mustang BMR  Panhard Bar Installation 2005-2014", "publishedDate": "2012-07-31T18:42:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARli_jaLMHY", "description": "Seven of the greatest illusionists on earth in the most spectacular magic show of all time!\nSee The Illusionists from 3 - 12 Jan 2014 as part of Summer.

Cut a piece of parchment paper just larger than the size of the pan. \u00a0\u00a0\n2. Fold the sheet of parchment paper in half. Fold the paper corner to corner. Continue folding diagonally, using the center point of the entire sheet as the starting point for the folds. The end result should appear as a very narrow triangle.\n3. Place the center point of the paper in the center of the cake pan. \u00a0Use your fingers to mark where the bottom edge of the pan meets the paper. Cut the paper at that mark.\n4. Unfold the paper, which should create a circle, and place it in the bottom of the pan. \u00a0Ensure it fits evenly or trim as necessary.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARm5oDzaMAA\n\n1. Begin with a dry cake pan and clean hands. Use a one-piece (not a Springform pan), professional-style cake pans for best results.\n2. Grab a small amount of softened butter with your fingers. \u00a0\n3. Rub the butter on the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides. Pay special attention to the corner where the bottom meets the side to make sure that area is greased as well. \u00a0\n4. Make sure the inside of the pan is completely and lightly greased. Remove any excess butter.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARm5oDzaMAA\n\n1. Place a small amount of flour in the cake pan.\n2. Shake the pan gently to allow the flour to be evenly distributed in the pan. It will stick to the butter.\n3. Continue to distribute the flour including holding the pan vertically and rolling it around so the flour can stick to the sides of the pan.\n4. Turn the pan upside down and tap to remove the excess flour.\n5. Spread a small amount of butter on one side of the parchment paper circle. Work from the center out.\n6. Place the parchment paper circle in the bottom of the pan, butter side up.\n7. Add a small amount of flour to the pan. Shake and tap the pan to distribute the flour over the buttered parchment paper. Tap the pan to remove any excess flour.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARm5oDzaMAA\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-grease-and-flour-a-cake-pan/", "title": "How to Grease and Flour a Cake Pan", "publishedDate": "2011-01-30T01:02:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARm9LdDLaA4", "description": "Handeln Sie wie ein Profi mit einer informative Depot\u00fcbersicht mit Wertentwicklung und detaillierter Analyse Ihrer Wertpapiere.

Signatures are a great way of sharing your personal web presence with others over the internet when you are communicating with them.\n\nFor those of you who make a habit of communicating with friends and family over the internet - it may be a good idea to embed your Facebook and Twitter account profiles right in your signature so people are inclined to see what you are all about simply by clicking on one of the links in your signature while you are having a conversation with them through E-mail.\n\nGoogle has come a long way in their Google Gmail E-mail service since it first debuted. The original software had the ability to integrate signatures but did not have such enhanced editing capabilities when it came to learning how to create a Google Gmail E-mail signature. Hopefully you will find this video easy to use and understand.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in this video, remember I will releasing more videos on how to work with the google Gmail E-mail service in the future, so make sure you sign up and subscribe to my videos.

Look at your latest mobile phone, lap top and other items that nobody could even imagine a few decades ago. Look at all the great buildings constructed by humans.

So there are a few different kinds that you could use. You\nmay see something very large like this that's a bronzer brush, or you could\nuse something very tailored like this, that's very compact and specific.\n\nSo, when I'm using a large bronzer brush like this, it's more for kind of\nbody. I don't like to use it all over the face. I feel like it gets a\nlittle too muddy and you really don't want to look like your face is a\ndifferent color from your neck. So with something like this, I'll just do\nbig sweeping motions maybe to blend color down onto my neck. Maybe I did a\nlittle bit of contouring here and I just want to blend that out, just\npretty simple.\n\nThis is really beautiful to use bronzer right on the chest. Especially\nduring summertime, it's nice to have a little bit of glow right on the\ncollar bone. It looks really beautiful. Another thing that you can do with\nthe other brush, this is a fan brush. So fans can either be used for\ngeneral kind of bronzing if you want to do something very light. It's nice\nand kind of loose and airy here, so it's not going to make too compact of a\ncolor distribution.\n\nSo what I like to do with this is actually contouring with bronzer. So I'm\ngoing to take a little bit, I've loaded the brush, and then I kind of place\nit right on the hairline. I'm just doing little sweeping, back and forth\nmotions. The reason I'm putting bronzer up here is because this is where\nbronzer naturally hits the forehead, the high points of the face.\n\nSo I did a little bit, as you see, back and forth like this, and now I'm\nblending it downwards just so it's very seamless. Then I kind of take it\ndown. When you're bronzing you want to think of making the number three. So\nit's kind of like this type of motion. So I bring it down. I do a little\nbit on the temple, and then I also kind of do this little area right here.\n\nA way to know exactly where to put it at the bottom of the cheekbone is\njust to go like that, and you'll instantly know where to put it. Then I\nsweep it down. Bronzing right here kind of gives your jawbone a little bit\nof a pop. So I do a little bit like this and you can kind of stick your\nneck out to see where to put it and then I just mirror the same thing on\nthe other side.\n\nThe thing that's nice about this brush is that it really does a lot of the\nwork for you. Having the right brushes is super important to making your\nmakeup look very flawless. It just makes everything easier on you and you\njust get a better end result.\n\nAs you can see, once I do this contour here, I blend downwards as well,\njust kind of fading that bronze off. Taking it under the chin again. I love\nthis tip because my jawbone kind of fades a little bit into my neck, so\nit's nice to get a little bit of a pop like this. As you can see, when I\nplace it here, I have the brush in the direction that it's going. Not like\nthis because that's going to give us too wide of a bronze. So place it flat\nand then blend downwards and that's how you use a bronzer brush.", "title": "How to Use a Bronzer Brush | Makeup Tips", "publishedDate": "2013-08-30T15:17:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARwqvbZfUnw", "description": "In the circo volador Mexico city, DF", "title": "Black oil - cover iron maiden", "publishedDate": "2012-12-05T12:37:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARx6rAgxNTM", "description": "Do\u00e7.

A very common question that we receive as chess coaches is what is the quickest way to win a game of chess? Now, everybody's idea of the game of chess, that's it's a very long, strategic, thought out game, but surprisingly enough there is a way to win a game of chess in only two moves. Now, when we're looking at the two move checkmate or also known as the foolsmate, it's going to take a sequence of bad moves by the opponent to fall into this trap of only two moves. \n\nNow interestingly enough the two move checkmate is going to occur on the black side checkmating white in two moves. So white is going to open up and play a move, F-4. As we can notice in this position by white moving their pawn to F-4 they've opened up their king's diagonal exposing the king and creating a weakness. Black can simply open up and make space for their queen and bishop and this is black's first move. White makes their second move further opening up the king's diagonal and allowing for black to make their second move which is to bring the queen along the diagonal to H-4 and checking the king. \n\nNow in chess when we're in check we look for three ways to get out of check. It's either to move the king, to block the check or to capture the checking piece. In this position the king has no safe squares to move. There are no pieces that can interpose or block the queen from checking the king and there are actually no pieces that can capture the checking piece or capture the queen. \n\nSo what has just happened is black has checkmated white in two moves and just to once again show you, white opens up making the move to F-4 opening up the king's diagonal. Black plays the pawn up opening up the queen to make a direct threat on white's king. White plays G-4 and black responds by bringing the queen out and making a direct threat to white's king and leaving white with no option to run, block or capture and ending the game in only two moves.", "title": "How to Achieve Checkmate in 2 Moves | Chess", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T13:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "ARy-ktXWXqw", "description": "Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\nSubscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\nLike us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\nEmperor Movie CLIP - Approval (2013) - Tommy Lee Jones Movie HD\n\nAs the Japanese surrender at the end of WWII, Gen.

One blockade was at Performance Arts Avenue in Waichai district. The protesters sat before a police cordon line and chanting \u2018let go (\u958b\u8def)\u2019. Many protesters came to the Central Government Offices from all directions and they were all stuck on footbridges or pavements. Finally, they had no ways to go and started walking on Connaught Road Central.

The team hypothesizes that in this early mammal, the eardrum was stabilized with the ossified cartilage as a supporting structure. \n\n\"Before we did not know the detailed morphology of how the bones of the middle ear detached, or the purpose of the ossified cartilage,\" Meng said.\n \n\"Liaoconodon hui changes previous interpretations because we now know the detailed morphology of the transitional mammal and can propose that the ossified cartilage is a stabilizer.\n \n\"I\"ve always dreamed of a fossil with a good ear ossicle.

Why Stubborn Skinny Calves Don't Grow Easily\nhttp://www.SeanNal.com/articles/training/stubborn-calves.php\n\nHaving stubborn calves is one of the hardest bodybuilding \"weak points\" to correct. If you were born with naturally skinny calves it can be a very hard area to pack reasonable size onto and will likely take significantly longer to develop than your other muscle groups.\n\nBut what's the reason for this? Why don't calves grow easily? Why are calf muscles hard to build?\n\nThere are 2 main reasons why your \"skinny calf genetics\" are giving you a rough time...\n\nFirst off, the calves contain low amounts of androgen receptors in comparison to the other muscles of the body. This means that testosterone can't exert a very powerful effect there, making it much harder to pack on reasonable size.\n\nSecondly, thin calves can be the result of having a long calf tendon which causes your calf muscle to insert higher up on your lower leg. This give you \"short calves\" that are great for sprinting and jumping, but not great when it comes to gaining size.\n\nIf you have stubborn calves and what you consider to be \"bad calf genetics\", you can certainly still build them up to a reasonable level, but it will just require more time, patience and attention to detail. \n\nCheck out the 2 articles below for more information on how to structure the best possible workout to add mass to your thin calves, as well as some key tips for proper calf training form.\n\nMost people make a ton of mistakes when it comes to their calf training, making it next to impossible to overcome their skinny calf genetics. You'll want every edge you can get, so make sure to check out those two resources to get yourself onto the right path.\n\n\n** Follow All Of My Latest Articles, Tips & Recommendations:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com\n\n** Get Your Free 28-Day Fast Mass Building Plan:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com/28-Day-Mass-Plan\n\n** Connect With Me On Facebook:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.Facebook.com/SeanNalewanyjOfficial\n\n** 4 Tips For Building Up Skinny Calves\n\u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxZmAl57_To\n\n** The 5 Best Calf Exercises + Sample Calf Workouts\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com/articles/training/best-calf-exercises.php", "title": "Bad Calf Genetics?

The plant that can voluntarily undergo a sex change!\n\nThe curious Sikkim cobra lily (Arisaema speciosum) as the name suggest, is a flower that is shaped like an extended hood of a Cobra. It has a slightly drooping spathe and a spadix decorated by a long threadlike extension. The spathe is purple in colour with white stripes, found only in Sikkim state of India and Nepal.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n\"Arisaema is a genus of about 150 species in the flowering plant family Araceae, native to eastern and central Africa, Asia and eastern North America. Its species are often called Cobra lilies, particularly the Asiatic species. A familiar species in North America is Arisaema triphyllum (Jack in the pulpit).\n\nAnother species Arisaema tortuosum is found in the Western Ghats and northern parts of India. This is commonly called whipcord cobra lily and by many other names in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe closest relatives of Arisaema appear to be Pinellia and Typhonium (although the latter as defined in 2004 seems to be paraphyletic, having given rise to Arisaema and other genera). One unusual trait shared by all Arisaema species, and not those of other genera, is the sex change. Arisaema plants are typically male when small, and female or hermaphraditic when large, with a single plant capable of changing sex based on nutrition and genetics, and perhaps changing sex several times during its long life (20 years or more).\"\n\n This footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

And they can include symptoms like vaginal discharge, inflammation or pain, redness, swelling of labia, that's quite a common one, or the perianal area can be affected as well.  You can have dysuria or painful urination.  It can be quite a common one.  Dyspareunia or painful intercourse, and also a foul vaginal odor can be associated with vaginitis.  So those are the common signs and symptoms of vaginitis.\n\nThe main type of vaginitis really would be atrophic vaginitis or senile vaginitis, which is a thinning of the lining of the vaginal wall.  This will come generally due to low estrogen, which is really what women go through after the menopause, and that can cause pain with intercourse and that can predispose you toward a yeast infection or irritation or redness.  So that's quite a common one.\n\nThe second one will be bacterial vaginosis, which is really caused by a bacterial overgrowth in the vagina.  And patients usually have less of the beneficial bacteria in that case, and are more prone to also getting a transmission of bacteria through the rectal area through to the vaginal area.  So it's important to wipe from front to back rather than the other way around, and to be careful with sexual relations.\n\nSo bacterial vaginosis can give you more of a profuse, watery, gray discharge with quite a foul fishy smelling odor as opposed to vaginal yeast infection, which is not really a profuse gray discharge; it's white and doesn't smell quite as foul as the bacterial vaginosis does.\n\nTrichomoniasis or Trich is a different kind of a vaginitis.  It's usually a sexually transmitted single cell protozoan parasite or called Trichomoniasis vaginalis.  So it can affect other parts of the urogenital tract of the female as well, and also the urethra can be affected.\n\nSo those are three key ones.  We spoke about the atrophic vaginitis.  We spoke about the bacterial vaginosis, and now we just spoke about the Trich, and the fourth one is Candida albicans; the fourth type of vaginitis.\n\nSo Candida albicans is a yeast-like fungal organism that causes thrush, and it's found normally in small amounts in the gut and it's normally kept in check by beneficial bacteria.  But it can also occur in the vaginal area and cause a lot of itch and sort of white discharge and severe irritation and burning in many cases.\n\nSo I hope that explains a bit about vaginitis.  The Candida albicans is certainly a form of vaginitis.  So I hope that answers your question.  Thank you.\n\nFor any further questions you can reach me at http://www.candidacrusher.com/contact-me", "title": "FAQ # 106  Is Vaginitis A Form Of Yeast Infection?", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T18:03:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "ASCUEg3vB2s", "description": "Ulyanovsk city.

I chose a 24\"x24\" platform (4 square feet of floor space) with 4x4 corners.  The beefy corner posts gave the structure great support. \n \nI chose a common 20\"x20\"x1\" filter available at most outlets.  You may choose from many different filters depending upon how small particles you want to capture.  Do not use the most inexpensive filters since they will not filter the small dust particles.\n\nThe top of the unit is not fastened to the corner posts but does contain a half-inch lip that sits over the posts.  The weight of the top and the vacuum that the unit produces works quite well.  Just lift off the top up to change the three filters.  I wanted simple, simple, simple and maximum air flow.  I think I achieved these goals.\n\nMy furnace fan had three speeds, but I wired it to the slowest speed.  I diffused the exhaust air up so I would not disturb any sawdust on the floor.  The unit runs quiet and definitely does the job!  This is a supplement to my woodshop tool dust collector system.\n\nMusic is \"Investigations\" by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a CC Attribution 3.0.\nhttp://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100646.", "title": "DIY - Simple Woodshop Air Filtration System", "publishedDate": "2013-10-17T14:23:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "ASWTT3J7hDM", "description": "The Cutaneous Malignancy Program at the John Theurer Cancer Center is a multidisciplinary approach to the prevention, treatment and management of cutaneous malignancies, including all stages of malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal-cell carcinoma, and other cutaneous malignancies.", "title": "Skin & Sarcoma Division - Cutaneous Malignancy Program at John Theurer Cancer Center", "publishedDate": "2012-02-16T22:14:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "ASW_TLjYod0", "description": "Eelgrass beds", "title": "Eelgrass beds", "publishedDate": "2009-10-13T20:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "ASWihj4KdII", "description": "NOT A GAMEPLAY.\n\nJust uploaded this OST because i could not find it in the internet.Hope you like as much as i do.", "title": "Shadow Of Rome OST - Village/Pansa's House", "publishedDate": "2014-03-21T23:04:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "ASX3cImBQY0", "description": "INTRACRANIAL VERTEBRAL ARTERIES AND PROXIMAL BASILAR ARTERY: OCCIPITAL WINDOW.

The word acceptable is utilized here, as there are so many bogus treatments for it, and some of them are even dangerous to try. This article uncovers that much research has been done for this condition, and can serve as a warning about the more dangerous \"cures\" that abound.\n\nThe best example of a potentially dangerous treatment is the use of certain oils that are known to actually burn the patient's skin. You will find that undiluted tea tree oil is highly dangerous when applied to the urethral opening of those suffering from penile infections. For instance if you look up various treatments, you may come across that some are suggesting undiluted plain white vinegar put directly onto an affected penile infection. Do so at your own risk, and do get children out of the way because chances are they will learn new swear words rather quickly. Another poor treatment is boric acid suppositories. Once again, tremendous care needs to be utilized prior to turning to this \"cure. \"\nNow some of the acceptable treatments for a male yeast infection may include such over the counter medications that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, nystatin, ketoconazole, and fluconazole. For example , the active ingredient found in Monostat is miconazole. Thus you will find a plethora or creams and lotions that probably will cure the male yeast infection, unless the fungus is caused by continued antibiotic treatments. In that particular case the male yeast infection treatment is that other antibiotics may be prescribed that will kill the fungus, or you may find that the doctor even prescribes some steroids in order to reduce this fungal infection. It is of course highly interesting that antibiotics are often both the cause and the cure for such infections. The human body requires such a delicate balance of friendly probiotic bacteria that it is difficult for even modern doctors to know how to achieve that balance.\n\nThus, even the medical field agrees that some yeast infections are very difficult to cure, and that often those with yeast infections find that they end up with recurring ones. Meanwhile, many doctors are also aware that some products do nothing for some, whereas some find a cure in one product but not another. In addition , some of these products will only relieve the assorted symptoms but will not affect a cure. Part of the problems are, of course , that even though some of the symptoms may go away, often the underlying cause of this horrid infection may not have been treated. The one thing that all doctors agree upon though is that no one, male or female, should ever ignore a recurring yeast infection.\n\nThere are also some prescription treatments that have their own problems associated with them. For instance, some men are allergic to some of those prescriptions. Also, a quantity of users report undergoing serious liver problems while utilizing some particular prescriptions. There is also an overabundance of side effects being reported with some treatments available by prescription only. Also the total unpredictability of how a yeast infection may affect one male in one way and another in yet another manner makes treatment all the more difficult.", "title": "Yeast infection Treatment - How I got Relief from Yeast Infection", "publishedDate": "2013-01-03T18:10:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "AT-ToV5heso", "description": "", "title": "10 The Industrial Revolution Revolution in England", "publishedDate": "2009-05-22T19:31:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "AT-UIWYepR4", "description": "How to heat treat bamboo with a blowtorch.

In this video, we explain the right way to palm strike that will devastate an attacker without hurting your hands.\n\nTo pull off a great palm strike, follow these rules:\n\n- Strike with the base of your palm - that way, the impact will be focused in one small spot, and you will hit with the most power. Otherwise it will be nothing but a glorified slap!\n\n- Don't necessarily strike forward, but rather forward-and-up, angle the palm slightly to make sure you are putting out as much force as you can.\n\n- Going under the jaw or squarely on the nose will have an added effect of disorienting an opponent and throwing him off-balance. A solid palm strike to the nose will definitely hurt like hell!\n\nThe best part about palm strikes - being as powerful as regular punches, they also give you options (and that's why we love them so much). You can always follow up with a grab or a finger jab to the eyes.\n\nEven though it's not a difficult strike, you should still take the time to practice it. But once you do, you will see how effective palm strikes are for self-defense!\n\nLeave us a comment below...it's always appreciated!\n\np.s. Want more self-defense material?

His team's work is detailed online in Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\n\"Risk assessment of stroke in individual patients undergoing total hip replacement (i.e. evaluate other risk factors for stroke) should be considered during the first 6 to 12 weeks,\" the researchers wrote. \n\nThey examined records of 200,000 individuals, including more than 66,000 who had total hip replacement from 1998 to 2007, to reach their findings.\n\nSource: McKnights", "title": "Joint Replacement Increases Stroke Risk Fourfold", "publishedDate": "2012-11-20T15:22:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AT8bRX0YcxI", "description": "Professor Ghafari demonstrate osteopathic visceral manipulation techniques.", "title": "Visceral Techniques of Osteopathy; by Professor Amir Ghafari", "publishedDate": "2014-02-13T11:38:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AT8mSpSOves", "description": "\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0644\u0643\u0645 \u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648 \u062d\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a iam \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0631\u062a 3G ...\n3G+ Jawal de Maroc Telecom est Gratuit\n\navec Opera Mini 5 Beta + Operator Trick\n\n+Puce Carte 3G+ Jawal\n+Portable 3G (UMTS)\n+ Network/ Connexions/ Access Point Name (APN): wap.iamgprs.ma\n\n\nDownload Opera Mini 5 Beta 2 handler\nhttp://f90c399e.linkbucks.com\n\n\n+Installer Opera Mini 5 Beta 2 hanlder sur le portable (Java)\n+Ouvrir et modifier les donners\n+Les donners doivent \u00eatre comme \u00e7a:\nCutsom HTTP Server: http://212.217.54.133:8080/http://80.239.242.253:80/\nCustom Socket Server: Socket://212.217.54.133:8080/http://80.239.242.253:1080/\n\nFrontQuery:\n212.217.54.133:8080/http://80.239.242.253/\n\n+Appuer sur OK pour terminer l'installation de 'Opera'\n\nwww.thekarmaoui.co.nr ici vous trouver plus d'information", "title": "INTERNET GRATUIT MAROC TELECOM 2G 3G", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T00:32:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "AT8xnJC2inw", "description": "Pacific Rim Kaiju Leatherback from Series 2!

I am upgrading a Late 2012 model running 2.3 Ghz Quad Core i7. It started out with 4 GB of Ram and I upgrade it to 16 GB.\n\nSteps to install Ram: \n1.) Turn off Mac Mini and Disconnect all wires.\n2.) Flip the Mac Mini over so that the back door is facing you. I recommend sitting it on something soft so you don't scratch up the apples beautiful device.\n3.) Turn the back door counter clockwise from the close circle to the open circle and pop the easy access panel off.\n4.) On each side of the Ram you will see small \"levers\" that release the Ram.\n5.) At the same time push the levers in opposite directions so that the Ram can pop out.\n6.) If you completed steps 1-5 correctly the first chip of Ram will be sticking out of the Mac Mini at a 30 degree angle. \n7.) Remove the Ram by pulling it straight out at the angle that it is pointing out. Make sure to pull it out at t he 30 degree angle so that you don't damage your computer or the chips of Ram. \n8.) The second chip of Ram should be removed the same way that you removed the first chip.\n9.) After both chips of Ram have been removed you should insert your new chips into your computer.\n10.) Start out by placing the first chip in the bottom seating. (The 2nd chip that you removed located at the bottom)\n11.) When inserting the chip remember to insert it at the same angle that you removed the previous one (30 degree angle).\n12.) Once you insert the first Ram chip at a 30 degree angle you can push it down until you here a click.\n13.) Repeat the steps for the 2nd Ram chip.\n14.) After both chips of Ram are installed place the back access panel on the Mac Mini and turn it clockwise until the panel shows that it is closed (close circle).\n15.) Now your ready to plug your Mac Mini back in and turn it on to make sure everything is working like its supposed to.\n16.) You can check to see if your Mac Mini is running the appropriate amount of Ram that you just installed by clicking Apple at the Top Left of your desktop screen and clicking \"About this Mac\". \n17.) If it shows the appropriate amount of Ram then you have successfully upgraded your Ram in your Mac Mini!\n\nIf you found this video helpful Rate, Comment, and Subscribe!\n\n\nContact me:\nEmail: jacob@justifiedwebdesign.com\nSkype: jacob.shaw1026\nTwitter: jacobtshaw\nWebsite: www.justifiedwebdesign.com  or  www.jwdportfolio.com", "title": "Mac Mini Ram Upgrade Tutorial 4 GB to 16 GB", "publishedDate": "2013-01-08T05:13:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATA9ECNm_EQ", "description": "", "title": "How to install L Series printers", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T13:26:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATAlaOIEeVU", "description": "Download: http://cravingforchaos.bandcamp.com/\n\nHey everyone,\n \nthis is our entry to the League of Legends - Songs of the Summoned contest. \n \nRegion: EU\nSummoner Names:\nT4cceptor\nschlaum\nwashed\nHey69Dude\n \nWe recorded this song when we were in the studio and got the option to record an additional song.

Sorry for the mediocre sound quality, it could be a lot better if we had the tracks.\n \nThe video scenes in the studio were shot for personal use and have now been used for this video. We did not intend to use them in this form while filming them. So don't get into a fuss about their quality.

Windfall Island :D Before I chose this song, I looked it up to try to find any other guitar covers. I couldn't find any, so I decided to take this one on myself. Before I get any criticism, I'd like to point out that the purpose of this was to make a song with one instrument and one instrument only. I understand this song will seem as if I was being lazy, but trust me everything about this arrangement had a purpose. It was just one guitar, 4 parts. Hope you enjoy and don't forget to Like, Comment, and Subscribe!!!! :D\n\nBy the way, I mentioned above that this caps off my acoustic set, but that doesn't mean that my summer song set is over!!

Today we're looking at a disease known as black knot.\n\nWere along the edge of the Clemson University Experimental Forest looking at a wild black cherry with some strange black growths on the twigs. This disease is known as black knot caused by the fungus Apiosporina morbosa. It infects cherries and plums.\n\nThe fungus can infect green shoots but can also enter through wounds. Infection leads to these long, rough galls on the twigs and branches and can even infect the trunks of trees. These galls can range in size from an inch to more than 20 inches. These galls can form on one side of a branch or can encircle the entire branch.  When infection circles the entire branch or twig it leads to death beyond the point of the gall.\n\nThe duration of the complete cycle of this disease is normally 2 years. After infection occurs in the spring, swellings appear in the fall on the current seasons growth. After being dormant during the winter, the fungus resumes growth in spring and the bark splits revealing olive-green fungal tissue covered with spores. These galls turn darker during the summer and fall and then turn hard and black during the winter. In the following spring, another spore stage is produced on the black knots that starts new infections.\n\nManagement of black knot begins with the selection of resistant cultivars. If any galls form on susceptible varieties these galls should be removed 4 inches below the point of the gall. All infected plant material should be destroyed.\n\nFor more information on gardening, landscaping, insect and disease problems on your plants, visit the Home & Garden Information Center web site at www.clemson.edu/hgic.", "title": "Black Knot on Cherries and Plums - James Blake", "publishedDate": "2009-07-19T07:12:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATE1spZVy2w", "description": "Last week, the Horseshoe Gang's album \"Top Ramen N!&&@\" was released through digital retailers.

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \"sheep\" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep.\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.", "title": "Have you seen them?", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T23:25:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "ATKUwKAWdcQ", "description": "A short film by Wim Wenders.\n\nMagnum turns 25 and celebrates pleasure.

But, to many Americans, the bailouts, stimulus packages, and regulatory schemes aimed at solving the problem seemed to merely pull the economy further into the mire of bureaucracy, party politics, and unsustainable debt that led to the crisis in the first place. Only the bankers and officials who caused the problem were in a position to solve it, and so fixing the system necessarily meant becoming part of it\u2014and thus making it even harder to fix. This is the crux of the Juggernaut.\n\nDrawing from all corners of political, social, and economic study, including specialism and the division of labor, competition and Game Theory, and Statism and Public Choice Theory, Morse weaves together a groundbreaking economic theory, which promises to shake up the current political discourse and usher in a new era of cooperation and prosperity.\n\nTranscript:\n\nRahm Emanuel, President Obama's Chief of Staff at the time: You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\n\nText: The worst economic crisis since the 1930s.\n\nPres. George W. Bush: We've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market; major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse; and some have failed.\n\nDavid Harvey: And the answer was, 'Get out your credit cards. We'll give everybody credit cards.' And American households, British households, all roughly doubled or tripled their debt over the last twenty or thirty years.\n\nText: Solutions that only made the problem worse.\n\nPaul Krugman: Then it started to come apart.\n\nAndrew Napalitano: A turn to central planning from Washington D.C. greater in magnitude than anything since the New Deal, of course we don't know how it's going to turn out.\n\nSteve Scully (interviewer): Deficit of eleven trillion dollars. At what point do we run out of money?\n\nBarack Obama: Well, we're out of money now.\n\nText: So how did we get into this mess?\n\nJonathan Rauch: A beneficiary of this program if you were to get rid of the cotton subsidies stands to lose tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars; the stakes are enormous. If, however, this program went away tomorrow, the American taxpayer would gain--and this is an approximate estimate--one dime a year.\n\nInterdependency advocate: What happens in Malta, and Indonesia, and Japan, affects what happens in Texas and Wisconsin; what happens in Massachusetts affects what's happening in South America.\n\nRaghuram Rajan: The push towards low-income housing, the extreme stimulus given by the Fed, the willingness to intervene if the system got into trouble. If we bet and take more risk, we make tons of money; if we lose, somebody else will pick up the pieces.\n\nFree-market economist: How is it that government is going to be able to spend a dollar in such a way that generates a dollar or more in value?\n\nNiall Ferguson: If you look at the Congressional Budget Office data, the United States is never again going to run a balanced budget, never. I mean, beyond our lifetimes, every year there's going to be a trillion dollars in new debt.\n\nPres. Barack Obama: You would think they would be saying 'Thank you'.\n\nNarrator: From the heights of corporate greed...\n\nRep.

It corresponds with the 3 Chinese characters \u9053\u5fb7\u7ecf.  The first character is tao, \u9053.  The Chinese word has several meanings.  But in this context, it is most often translated as the Way. The second character is Te, \u5fb7.  It's most often translated as Virtue.  But in Tao Te Ching, Te refers to something more than virtue.  I would interpret it as the application of Tao.  Some would say that it also carries the connotations of power and vitality.  The third character is \u7ecf.  In this context, it can be translated as scripture or classic.  So you may say that Tao Te Ching means Scripture of Tao and Te, or classic of tao and te.   Although written 2500 years ago by Lao Tzu, tao te ching is very widely read and many people are amazed at how relevant it is to our world today.  The program is produced and presented by Soon Teo.
