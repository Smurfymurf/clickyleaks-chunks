This results in a structural rearrangement within the a fused octahedral(O) and tetrahedral (T) sheets of the OT-layer. The displacements are  exaggerated to emphasize the structural displacements. Upon the intralayer swelling, the hydrogen bonding interactions weaken between two adjacent OT-sheets, which facilitates the intercalation process.\"\n\nRobert K.

(everything besides the XOR output works with or without a Jupiter Storm!)\n- VCA inputs are normalised to the newly-enabled XOR and main (\"I\") output of Jupiter Storm when nothing else is plugged in\n- The envelopes and VCAs can be fully utilised elsewhere in your system by plugging into the corresponding function's jacks\n- Perfect for synthesising voltage controlled percussion and other textures!\n\nDescription\n=======================\nGalilean Moons is a dual amplitude transmutator. It transmutates the amplitude of incoming signals through the use of voltage controlled envelopes and VCAs. It is designed primarily to create voltage controlled percussive sounds when fed with a sound source (in particular, its sister module, Jupiter Storm), but can be used for all sorts of other tasks in your modular system as well as to generate typical synth sounds.\n\nGalilean moons features two \"moons\". Each moon is composed of a voltage controlled attack/decay envelope with its own dedicated low-distortion linear VCA. Each envelope can also act as attack/sustain/release or can go into LFO/automatic looping mode with the flick of a switch. \n\nGalilean Moons will normalise its VCA inputs to a Jupiter Storm cosmic noise oscillator through a simple expansion cable at the back, but it can also function standalone in any modular system. Of course, the new Jupiter Storm noise output, \"XOR\", which is activated by connecting a Galilean Moons to your Jupiter Storm, will not function when you use Galilean Moons alone in a system. This is the only feature which requires a Jupiter Storm to be connected.\n\nThe XOR noise output sounds similar to (but not exactly like) Jupiter Storm with the Noise Core Disruptor is engaged, even when it is not engaged. This allows you to get both flavours of noise from Jupiter Storm simultaneously, making it a lot more versatile.\n\nThe VCAs and voltage controlled envelopes can each be used on their own in your system when you don't want to use them the way they are internally linked together. Plugging a signal into any of the respective jacks will break the internal connections and let you use the components on their own. You can use the linear, DC-coupled VCAs to control DC signals in your system when not using the module for its intended use, for example.\n\n\nTechnical Details (for built eurorack -- DIY current/depth is different!)\n==================================================\n- 18HP\n- Requires ~+88mA, -65mA @ 12V \n- 30mm deep\n\nhttp://cv.hexinverter.net/?projects=galilean-moons-dual-amplitude-transmutator\n\n88 mA +12V\n65 mA -12V\n30 mm Depth", "title": "Galilean Moons: DEMO3: Jupiter Storm Expanded with Galilean Moons", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T21:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZezGK1wcRQ", "description": "KRON 4's Philippe Djegal reports View full story at http://news.kron4.com", "title": "Veteran CHP Public Affairs Officer Charged with Child Porn Possession", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T03:36:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZfA6wHJJZM", "description": "http://www.501.gregvan.com Click on this link if you're interested in more information about the book written by Greg Vanden Berge.

We have seen before that permanent magnetism does not survive at high temperatures. Sir Bullard introduced in 1955 a modification of the above setup which qualifies as a \"self-excited dynamo\" (i.e. a dynamo which does not rely on the use of a permanent magnet).\nAs we know that electrical currents in a coil produce a dipolar magnetic field (see \"Oersted's Experiment\" above), the basic idea is to suppress the magnet and replace it by a coil. If the disc is rotated rapidly enough, so that the generation mechanism examplified in \"The Faraday Disc Dynamo\" is strong enough to counteract ohmic resistivity, then any seed of electrical current will be amplified and grow. The system will then act as a self-excited dynamo.\nNote however that the movie here is purely illustrative of the principle of this dynamo as dynamo action would in fact require a much faster rotation of the disc than can be achieved with this setup.\n[no sound]\nVisit http://mhd.ens.fr/exp/", "title": "Dynamo 7: Principle of the Bullard Dynamo", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T12:49:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "7ZhhDvturno", "description": "Forfun - Garota de Floral [\u00c1udio HD]", "title": "Forfun - Garota de Floral [\u00c1udio HD]", "publishedDate": "2013-10-15T04:03:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "7Zi-h2JB_cw", "description": "Learn Italian with The Travel Linguist.

The sensor which supposed to detect the very feeble \"electromagnetic waves\" is nothing more than two plates separated by a non-conductive plastic, and when held by hand, complete the circuit due to the skin resistance. As seen on the video, i totally removed the sensor and replace a resistor that simulates the skin resistance (around 10k-100K) and later found out that my resistor is suffering from blood sugar imbalance (diabetic) and have problem on its \"kidneys\". Do resistor too emits weak magnetic energy the same as produced by a human cell????\n\nYou can also put a wet towel and wrap it around the hand sensor and diagnosed what is the problem of your wet towel!! :)\n\nAgain, this my personal opinion based on the electronic test that i have conducted.

They are among the most southerly distributed of all seabirds, as are the emperor penguin, the South Polar skua, the Wilson's storm petrel, the snow petrel, and the Antarctic petrel. They are named after Ad\u00e9lie Land, in turn named for the wife of French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville who discovered these penguins in 1840. The Ad\u00e9lie penguin is one of three species in the genus Pygoscelis. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago, about 2 million years after the ancestors of the genus Aptenodytes. In turn, the Ad\u00e9lie penguins split off from the other members of the genus around 19 million years ago. Based on a 2014 analysis of fresh guano-discolored coastal areas, there are 3.79 million breeding pairs of Ad\u00e9lie penguins in 251 breeding colonies, a 53 percent increase over a census completed 20 years earlier. The colonies are distributed around the coastline of the Antarctic land and ocean. Colonies have declined on the Antarctic Peninsula, but those declines have been more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. During the breeding season, they congregate in large breeding colonies, some over a quarter of a million pairs. Individual colonies can vary dramatically in size, and some may be particularly vulnerable to climate fluctuations. The Ad\u00e9lie penguins breed from October to February on shores around the Antarctic continent. Ad\u00e9lies build rough nests of stones. Two eggs are laid, these are incubated for 32 to 34 days by the parents taking turns (shifts typically last for 12 days). The chicks remain in the nest for 22 days before joining cr\u00e8ches. The chicks moult into their juvenile plumage and go out to sea after 50 to 60 days. These penguins are mid-sized, being 46 to 75 cm (18 to 30 in) in height and 3.6 to 6 kg (7.9 to 13.2 lb) in weight. Distinctive marks are the white ring surrounding the eye and the feathers at the base of the bill. These long feathers hide most of the red bill. The tail is a little longer than other penguins' tails. The appearance looks somewhat like a tuxedo. They are a little smaller than other penguin species. Their appearance is closest to the stereotypical image of penguins as mostly black with a white belly. Ad\u00e9lie penguins can swim up to 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). Ad\u00e9lie penguins are preyed on by leopard seals, skua, and occasionally, orcas. Specifics of their behaviour were documented extensively by Apsley Cherry-Garrard (a survivor of Robert Falcon Scott\u2019s fateful final journey to the South Pole) in his book The Worst Journey in the World. Cherry-Garrard noted: \"They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children or like old men, full of their own importance\". Certain displays of their selfishness were commented upon by George Murray Levick, a Royal Navy surgeon-lieutenant and scientist who also accompanied Scott on his ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition of 1910, during his surveying of penguins in the Antarctic: \"At the place where they most often went in, a long terrace of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed\". The Ad\u00e9lie penguin is known to feed mainly on Antarctic krill, ice krill, Antarctic silverfish, sea krill and glacial squid (diet varies depending on geographic location) during the chick-rearing season. The stable isotope record of fossil eggshell accumulated in colonies over the last 38,000 years reveals a sudden change from a fish-based diet to krill that started two hundred years ago. This is most likely due to the decline of the Antarctic fur seal since the late 18th century and baleen whales in the 20th century. The reduction of competition from these predators has resulted in a surplus of krill, which the penguins now exploit as an easier source of food. Ad\u00e9lie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in October or November, at the end of winter and the start of spring. Their nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about \u22122 \u00b0C or 28 \u00b0F), the parents take turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent who is incubating does not eat. In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Ad\u00e9lie penguin lives on sea ice but needs the ice-free land to breed. With a reduction in sea ice, populations of the Ad\u00e9lie penguin have dropped by 65% over the past 25 years. Young Ad\u00e9lie penguins who have no experience in social interaction may react to false cues when the penguins gather to breed.", "title": "Ad\u00e9lie Penguins Colony, Deception Island, Antarctic Peninsula, South Pole", "publishedDate": "2011-08-15T21:19:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_D1xlhQ37A", "description": "Before and After images plus footage.

Oarsman Ale grew out of a desire to explore the tradition of session beers, trading intensity for finesse while still creating a worthwhile experience for the taster. The grain bill includes a healthy portion of wheat, while light hopping lend citrus & herbal notes to the aroma. Fermented with Bell's house ale yeast, Oarsman comes in at 4.0% alcohol by volume. Rather than being the dominant flavor note, the tartness in Oarsman takes on more of a palate-cleansing role, making it perfect with meals or purely on its own. \n\nMY BLOG: http://cheertobeers.wordpress.com/\nMY FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/CheertoBeers\nMY TWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/cheertobeers\nBUY SHIRTS: http://cheertobeers.spreadshirt.com/", "title": "Bell's Oarsman Ale Beer Review | Cheer to Beers", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20T00:00:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_G5KDk1gH4", "description": "For info on Tony's survival books or courses, visit http://www.apathways.com  -This trigger setup comes from Zimbabwe.

She accepted the medal in her hand and wiped her tears holding it, before handing it to South Korean silver medalist Ji Na Park, who had defeated Sarita in a controversial bout on Tuesday.  \n\nThe 32-year-old Sarita later said she would continue to compete as she wants to set an example for future boxers, but \"this is not acceptable.\" Sarita lost on points against Park in a bout where she was the dominant boxer.\nAn emotional Sarita slammed India's boxing officials too. On Tuesday, she felt ignored because \"she was from the North-east.\" On Wednesday, soon after the medal ceremony drama, Sarita said: \"It has been 24 hours and not one official has come to speak with me and ask me if I am fine. They just come here to take photos with medallists and nothing else.\"\n\nThe judges's decision to award the semifinal clash to Park on points had left Sarita stunned. She stood in the middle of the ring in disbelief as the judges almost unanimously awarded the fight to the Korean. The Indian corner was angry and agitated even as Sarita's husband Thoiba Singh protested vociferously.\n\nThe final decision in the bout - with two judges ruling against Sarita - was booed by fans. India later lodged an official protest with the Amateur International Boxing Association's technical jury team.

It is the result of deteriorated articular cartilage, the slippery cushion at the end of the bones that works to absorb shock and facilitate the easy movement of the bones over each other. When your cartilage wears down, bone rubs against bone and causes pain and swelling. If fragments break off from the bone and cartilage this causes bone spurs.\n\nOsteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are the two most common forms of arthritis. Although there is no cure for arthritis there are things you can do to reduce chronic pain. With Osteoarthritis the knee is the most commonly affected joint in the body. Proper body alignment is important; people who are bow-legged or knock-kneed for example are more likely to develop arthritis in their knees for example.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is slightly different, your body's immune system turns against itself. Your knee is encased in synovium, a capsule filled with fluid that lubricates the moving parts of your knee. With rheumatoid arthritis, the body's defense against infection turns against the synovium. White blood cells that would normally attack infection go after cartilage and bone. The synovial lining responds by swelling and the muscles and ligaments that surround the knee are weakened and damaged. People with rheumatoid arthritis may experience symptoms of fatigue and unwellness in addition to the symptoms of osteoarthritis. (Remember to get lots of rest if you have RA)\n\nOne of the most important things you can do if you are suffering from arthritis is take an honest look at your weight. Dr. Brian Halpern author of the Knee Crisis Handbook says, \"I tell every single one of my arthritic patients to lose weight if they need to.\"\n\nIf you have osteoarthritis you will experience pain, aching and stiffness in your knee especially after inactivity. You may notice a reduction in the range of motion of your knee joint and hear a crunching sound or feeling when you move your knee.\n\nThe most important thing you can do for arthritis is increase the range of motion of your knee joint. Your instinct is to immobilize your joint and while that might feel good in the short term, it is going to cause more pain in the long term. Also gaining strength for the muscles that support the knee will help relieve some of the stress that the knee joint takes and keep your knee joint healthy.\n\nDoing this yoga video will allow you to feel like you are on top of the disease rather than a victim of it. Remember, do what you can. Don`t expect to be able to do the exercises just like me! I don`t have arthritis in my knees! If you can move your joints through a range of motion that is a third as much or half is much, that is fantastic, work up to full range of motion. There is no perfect or better or best in yoga, what matters is that you show up on your yoga mat and start where you are. Listen to your own body and do what you can today. That is all anybody is asking. Send me your comments and questions. I value your feedback and read and respond to every single response.", "title": "Knee Arthritis Exercise Video", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T23:17:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_RMi-URWtA", "description": "Una buena charla puede hacer que, con motivaci\u00f3n, un equipo te\u00f3ricamente inferior le gane a uno muy superior", "title": "Las grandes arengas del f\u00fatbol", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T02:46:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_RZLAxsa8Q", "description": "The Kooks - Seaside", "title": "The Kooks - Seaside", "publishedDate": "2007-05-11T06:40:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_R_L9Qzdug", "description": "or holiday 2014, time flies while waiting for the locksmith in front of a manhattan brownstone with anna kendrick. \n\nto shop the full film pop over to http://bit.ly/1u64Nif", "title": "the waiting game starring anna kendrick", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T16:32:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_Rvso6UVZU", "description": "Download on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/WillyWonka\nLike Glebstar: http://facebook.com/djglebstar", "title": "Glebstar - Willy Wonka (Dubstep) 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T22:20:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_S2KA6Rs3k", "description": "Reaktion von Lithium mit Wasser unter Zugabe des Indikators Phenolphthalein.

(CNN) -- The girl who was arrested for selling marijuana-laced brownies to classmates to raise money for a prom dress, is facing possible further punishment.\nSaira Munoz, 19, was sentenced to four years probation and nine days in jail on drug charges earlier this week; but with time already served, she did not have to go back to jail.\n\nNow it turns out she may be in this country illegally and could be deported. Immigration officials say they are reviewing the case and have yet to file deportation proceedings.\n\nLast fall, Munoz enlisted the help of a classmate to help her sell the brownies. A customer who was acting erratically after eating one of the brownies on campus was taken to a hospital in an ambulance for observation. Investigators found cannabis in the brownies.\n\npromdress\nA teen who was arrested for selling pot brownies faces deportation. (KXTL)\n\nIt was the talk of the campus at Yuba City's River Valley High School when she was arrested on drug charges and for recruiting a minor to help her sell the brownies.\n\n\"I mean we have 12-, 13-year-old freshmen, so that's bad,\" student body Vice President Diojot Shergill said.\n\nBut Shergill also said deportation was too harsh of an outcome. Classmates feel it was more in-line with a student prank, even though Munoz did it for cash.\n\n\"It's too much trouble to deport somebody for that,\" student James Steerstold FOX40.\n\nGiven the high school climate these days, some felt deportation doesn't fit the crime.\n\n\"She should not be deported for making weed brownies. I know lots of students who do that,\" Dursimrim Kalar said.\n\nWhile it's not known if federal immigration will take action, the terms of her probation state that if deported, she will not be allowed back into the country unless she gets legal status first. That is not likely if she's listed as a drug offender.\n\nThe Sutter County Probation Department says should the Immigration Service find that Munoz is not a citizen and is in this country legally, the conviction would jeopardize her legal status and she could still be deported.\n\nMunoz is deferring to her attorney who undoubtedly is looking at all avenues to keep her in the country.", "title": "Teen who sold pot brownies to buy prom dress faces deportation", "publishedDate": "2014-04-11T23:01:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_X8c2b0BB0", "description": "The effect of adding a catalyst (Manganese Dioxide) to Hydrogen Peroxide.", "title": "Hydrogen Peroxide + catalyst", "publishedDate": "2009-07-13T11:37:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_XN1JQwS4I", "description": "just a lyric video ;D\ni really miss her music D:  luv you guys\nthe song belongs to hilary duff\nno copyright infrigment intended", "title": "whos that girl hilary duff  lyrics", "publishedDate": "2011-06-22T17:07:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_XN51PdG9w", "description": "the news man, the paperboy, even tv...", "title": "whatever happened to predictability...", "publishedDate": "2007-08-09T18:30:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_Y1CKv5728", "description": "Was given this challenge in my Youtube inbox and couldn't resist the chance to perform it.

If he's in the middle of an attack animation, deactivate the bracelet and dodge the attack easily. This gives enough time for the cooldown on the Bracelet to wear off and also gives magic. \nOnce you get him to the last bar, make sure to get 2 bars of magic. Take off a bit more of his HP before you switch to Climax Brace 2. Then activate UC and finish him off with PPP(hold). You don't even need to dodge, you're unkillable while in the mech.\n\n-And that's really all there is to it. There is no super cheap tactic you can use like in Bayo 1  (Pillow Talk + Climax Brace) so I would say the fight is harder simply for the fact that you can't super easily cheese him. \nAlso fighting him normally, with Bayonetta/Jeanne and without using Bracelet of Time is far harder than fighting Rodin in Bayo 1 normally, so yeah.", "title": "Bayonetta 2 Platinum Ticket Rodin Fight + Cutscene", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T13:29:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_ZmPjFpOvo", "description": "Subscribe To Watch New !\n\nA skateboard is a typewrite of sports equipment victimised primarily for the activeness of skateboarding.

There's one style of play where the server hits the serve and immediately comes to the net while his partner is at the net. There's another style where the server hits the serve and stays back. Finally, there's a style where the server is hitting a strong serve. The players are having trouble returning, and both players opt to stay back as the serve is hit.\n\nThe first one we'll talk about is serving and running to the net. Remember, when you're serving and you're playing doubles, you're not going to run to the middle of the court. You're going to be in the middle of your half of the court. You're going to come in. You're going to stop as your opponent is making the return. That's our split step. The person returning serve should not necessarily think about hitting the return deep now, because the player's at the net. The best return often for that player is a low ball. Make that volleyer bend his knees and pop that volley up. If he can do that, his partner who's up at the net will be able to pick some volleys off right away. So that's the number one tactic versus serving and volleying.\n\nJoe Perez: Serving and staying back is another method, where you might want to serve and not come to the net, because the returns are at your feet all the time, and you're constantly trying to have to hit low volleys. So, you serve and stay back and wait for the return to be short. Come in, hit an approach shot off that short return, and now you're at the net. Remember, in all these doubles tactics and strategies, the important thing to remember is that generally being at the net is a good idea. Doubles is sort of what I call \"king of the net.\" If you get to the net first, you're going to win. Serve and stay back, though, is a way to wait for that short return to happen, return it, come in and join your partner at the net.\n\nNow, the last one is what we call double-back. It's when the server has such a powerful serve, and the net man, his partner at the net, the net man has such a great volley, that they're constantly hitting shots that you can't control and hit back. So you can elect to have both players, the returner and his partner, stay back at the baseline and play defensive doubles. Often that can be effective, especially if both players have good lobs.\n\nKirk: You take away that volleyer's target if that net player moves back to the back of the court. Going back to the second example that Joe gave you, where the player served and stayed back, it sounds nice, if you can come in on the second ball, if that player hasn't already taken the return and come right to the net. So when I see a player serving and staying back, I'm going to take the gamble of returning it, hopefully away from the net player, back to that server back there. And I'll come scooting into the net. Now we are two up at the net. This poor guy better back up, because he's in harm's way now.\n\nJoe: You know, I guess what we're also talking about is that doubles and singles is like a chess match. There's a certain tactic, and there's a certain response to that tactic. So you've got to be ready to respond in kind.", "title": "3 Best Doubles Tactics | Tennis Lessons", "publishedDate": "2013-08-23T00:20:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "7_vUtGcPZDc", "description": "All original media is copyrighted by their respective owners.

The plant became the state flower of Minnesota in 1902, and it became protected by state law in 1925. It is illegal to pick or uproot a showy lady slipper flower in Minnesota. This rare plant has vanished from much of its historical range due to habitat loss.\n\nFound in damp woods, bogs, and swamps, the orchid can take 16 years to grow and bloom for the first time. The plants can live for 50 years, and tend to flower in late June and early July. Usually, there are one or two flowers per stem, but there can be three or four. The stem has a hairy appearance, and the \"hairs\" can cause irritation to some people.\n\nAlthough this plant was originally chosen as the provincial flower for Prince Edward Island in 1947, it was so rare on the island that another Lady's Slipper, C. acaule (moccasin flower or pink lady slipper), has replaced it as the province's floral emblem.\nCypripedium reginae can be found in Canada from Saskatchewan east to Atlantic Canada, and the eastern United States south to Arkansas and Tennessee. \n--------------------------------------\nThis flower is quite rare, and is considered imperiled (SRANK S2) or critically imperiled (S1) in Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Newfoundland and Labrador, North Dakota, Nova Scotia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Additionally, it is considered vulnerable (S3) in Indiana, Maine, Manitoba, Massachusetts, New York, Quebec, Vermont, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\n\nIt was historically found in Kentucky and North Carolina, but has not been found recently.

Except for brief moments of repast, they've been kept apart pretty much for the entire run so far, due to the independent machinations of Sheridan's eeeeeeeevil father Alistair (who doesn't want Luis nosing into Crane family affairs) and Beth Wallace (who is obsessed with Luis, and will go to any lengths to get Sheridan out of the picture). In the major story arc of the past year, Beth kept a pregnant Sheridan captive in a pit, where she eventually gave birth. The baby was thought to have died in an accident, but Beth has claimed the baby as her own. Sheridan is understandably addled by all this trauma, and her insistence that her child is still alive leads to her being jacketed and dragged into the psych ward. She attempted to escape, but ended up getting jacketed (yellow-collared Posey; used the front loop and crotch strap but not the side loops) again and locked into a quiet room. A few days later, Luis stormed in and \"rescued\" her.\nAntonio, Sheridan's husband and Luis' brother, stumbles across them in the throes of ecstasy, and is easily manipulated by Alistair into signing commitment papers. A psychiatrist and two orderlies show up at the cabin where Sheridan is residing and begin to force her into a jacket, but Sheridan promises to go quietly and they remove it. Of course, as soon as they do that, she runs back into the cabin and locks the front door. Too bad she didn't lock the back door also, as the orderlies come in that way, force her into the jacket, and eventually lock her into a padded cell in the psych ward.", "title": "PASSIONS Sheridan in straitjacket", "publishedDate": "2009-11-01T23:04:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "7aTe9sidGSw", "description": "", "title": "Melophagus ovinus", "publishedDate": "2013-10-06T01:20:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "7aTod2YpZbY", "description": "View this video to show the basic layout and post installation for USAVinyl's Vinyl Fencing.

Acer lives with his owner Maureen O\u2019Sullivan at her Miniature Horse Farm in Corringham, Essex. The three-year-old sleeps in a small stable, plays in the field and even wanders around the family home. The little equine is best friends with a Labrador called Demon, who stands inches taller than the tiny horse. Acer was born with a rare condition called dwarfism, which means he didn\u2019t grow properly in the womb.\n\nVideographer / Director: Matt Writtle\nProducer: Amanda Stringfellow\nEditor: Sonia Estal\n\nFor more compelling footage of the amazing side of life:\n\nFACEBOOK: Like Barcroft TV -  \nhttps://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\n\nTWITTER: Follow @Barcroft_TV -  \nhttps://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\n\nWEBSITE: For licensing & business enquiries, \nvisit the Barcroft Media site -\nhttps://www.Barcroftmedia.com", "title": "Tiny Horse: Cute Steed Suffers From Dwarfism", "publishedDate": "2014-10-02T10:05:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "7aboOoRipJ4", "description": "The NEW INCRA TS-LS offers the one thing that every table saw fence should have, but none of them do, namely, Automatic Positioning Control.

He talks about how often patients literally create a self-fulfilling prophecy of suffering.  Once the physical pain system is activated, the anticipatory pain reaction can actually make the pain symptoms worse.  Whenever people feel the pain, they interpret it in a way that makes it worse.  They start thinking about the pain in a way that actually makes it worse.  They tell themselves that the pain is \"awful and terrible,\" and that \"I can't handle the pain.\"  They convince themselves that \"it's hopeless, I'll always hurt, and there's nothing I can do about it.\"  \n\nDr. Grinstead shares in his new book \"Freedom from Suffering: A Journey of Hope\" how people can move beyond anticipatory pain and achieve more effective chronic pain management and obtain true freedom from their suffering.  To purchase Dr. Grinstead's book please click this link http://www.freedomfromsufferingbook.com.

This is a classic tone wood pairing that makes for a balanced, even response with plenty of warmth and an articulate high-end. The hollow body construction gives the tone depth and dynamics. At 2\" body depth and and 13.5\" lower bout, this body isn't huge, but it's big enough to provide tonal depth. The vintage soft \"U\" neck shape is made from mahogany and maple, and it has 22 vintage-style frets on a rosewood fretboard with pearloid block inlays. The 24.75\" scale length creates an easy, slinky feel that encourages big bends. For pickups, the M-75 has two Guild \"Frequency Tested\" Single-Coils. They sound great clean and really fatten up with some distortion. Other features include a bone nut and deluxe enclosed tuners with cream buttons.

I'm a practising artist known for my Blooms paintings, and a teacher getting amazing painting results from my students.\nIt's natural to feel tentative or scared of doing something new, particularly when it comes to art and expressing yourself. What if you fail and make a fool of yourself? What will others think of your efforts?  Will it be the end, or it will it be the start of an amazing creative you?\n\nSince you're here reading this, it's likely there's a very important part of you that's truly hungry to bust out, paint and express yourself.  I was there once myself so I fully understand. That's why I'm releasing my highly effective teaching system to accelerate your learning. I help you avoid the mistakes other artists make so you won't get stopped. Before you even pick up the paint brushes learn how to make choices to set yourself up for success. Experience the joy of painting and learn to paint blooms, landscape, still life and portraiture within 12 months, from home.\n\nIf you've secretly been thinking of having a go at painting you've definitely come to the right place.\n\nDon't let years slip by, shelving your creative dreams when you can unleash your creativity today!\n\nTruth is, you don't need to be born with a creative bone in your body to be able to paint. You simply need to learn my powerful effective steps that will have you painting with certainty and confidence in no time. My compassionate step by step Blooms Painting Method\u2122 is a system of painting that anyone can apply. I know because hundreds and hundreds of total newbies have already used it to unlock their creative potential.\n\nLearn to create paintings that inspire and move others. Surround yourself with beauty and art.\n\nAll you need is a table top, and to be willing.\n\nI've taught loads of everyday people with absolutely no experience whatsoever to be confident artists. I started teaching in my kitchen due to popular demand and now I teach all over Australia, and at my painting studio, Salon Rouge, in the Barossa Valley. Everyone loves a beautiful painting and the joy it brings.\n\nPerhaps you've seen the awesome testimonials from my Blooms students who've learned to connect with their creativity and passion, achieving BREAKTHROUGH RESULTS with stunning artwork. Many of them sell their painting homework and earn while they learn.\n\nSome have made painting their life's work and are even being paid big bucks to do what they love!\n\nPaint for yourself or paint for others.  Paint at a pace that suits you.\n\nIt's my hope you'll join me and experience my structured program as you move towards your creative dreams.

The California blackberry is a ancestral species from which the Loganberry, Boysenberry, and the Marionberry were derived. As with other members in the Rubus genus, California blackberries are vegetative in their first year (primocane) and produce berries in their second year (floricane). The stems are covered in sharp thorns that are half-red at the base and half-white at the tip. The first settlers to arrive from Europe called berry bushes like these bush lawyers because their thorns would grip and hold onto you until they drew blood.\n\nThe edible, sweet berries are up to 2 centimeters in diameter and are dark purple or black. Unfortunately, I don't have the luxury as a single explorer to film all of my plant subjects in all of their life phases, so I don't have berry footage to show you. These plants need a consistent source of moisture to grow large berries. This bush with creeping vines was about 10 meters uphill of Hell Creek in Escondido, California. Hell Creek is a seasonal creek that only runs after the rainy winter season. It's been dry for a long time from the looks of it. It's still very hot in November right now in San Diego, around 30 Celsius in my two trips to Hellhole Canyon Preserve, and rainfall has been sparse in the second half of 2012.\n\nCalifornians blackberries are literally low-hanging fruit; they're an easy source of food for foragers in California's riparian habitats and any terrain feature that collects enough water. One bush can grow up to 25 kilograms of blackberries in a year. Curiously enough, blackberries are the most expensive fresh fruit to buy in America, yet they grow wild and are probably more accessible and easier to spot than any other wild fruit.", "title": "California Blackberry, Rubus ursinus, Escondido, California", "publishedDate": "2012-11-06T22:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "7avAwkJmbU4", "description": "\u0421\u041a\u0410\u0427\u0410\u0422\u042c http://mkt-trade.com.ua/goto/http://pro-trading.in.ua/pro-t-ray-scalper/\n\n\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0412\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 http://pro-trading.in.ua/", "title": "\u0424\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a PRO-T-Ray Scalper", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T05:48:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "7av_yKvcPKs", "description": "Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov\n\n\nDmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov (Russian: ???????? ??????????????? ???????, born 26 April 1954)[1] is a Russian journalist.

If you've never been here, let us be the first to say that this place is incredible. It is not only massive but it's filled with books and records that could keep you busy for days upon end.  \n\nThe shop keep was kind enough to let us set up in a quaint, open room tucked away in the back of the store to film this version of newer song called \"Secondary Swan.\" The trio were also joined by their friends in The Black Magic Family on banjo and flute for this session. You may recognize OOTF alum Mike Bruno in there, who plays with our friend Megan in Bad Braids.

After hitting an all-time low, giving a lecture to elementary school kids, Dr. Marshall meets an ambitious young scientist named Holly (Anna Friel), who tells him she has followed all his work and believes he's a genius. Spurred on by her enthusiasm, he finishes building the device that will allow him to time travel -- something he promptly does along with Holly, and white-trash fireworks salesman Will (Danny McBride), after Will leads them into a cave that seems like a promising place to test the new machine. They end up in a world full of dinosaurs, sand, and scary lizard-like creatures known as Sleestacks. They quickly lose the machine that brought them to this alternate universe, and if they ever want to return home, the trio must recover it with the help of Chaka (Jorma Taccone), the monkey-like friend they make in this strange place.\n\n\"land of the lost\",\"land of the lost clip\",\"land of the lost trailer\",\"land of the lost part 1\",\"will ferrell\",\"danny mcbride\",\"jorma taccone\",\"anna friel\",\"camera videos\",\"dinosaur videos\",\"vine videos\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",comedy,fantasy,\"sci-fi adventure\",\"ryan kavanaugh\",\"daniel lupi\",\"joshua church\",\"michele panelli-venetis\",\"julie wixson darmody\",\"brad silberling\",\"marty krofft\",\"sid krofft\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++420657,/m/018grr,/m/02wycg2,/m/091yn0,/m/01pd1k", "title": "Land of the Lost (3/10) Movie CLIP - Synchronized Swinging (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T12:48:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "7b36l8-GJqQ", "description": "Der russische Pianist Alexander Gorlenko spielt schon seit Jahren auf den Kreuzfahrtschiffen von Hapag Loyd sowohl auf der MS Europa als auch auf der MS Hanseatic", "title": "Alexander Gorlenko auf der MS Hanseatic - Klassik meets Pop - 1", "publishedDate": "2010-03-23T14:28:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "7b3qF4QThzg", "description": "http://www.boutiqueaccessories.com.au When buying fashion accessories online, how do you know they will suit you?

The Virtual Mirror Augmented Reality application uses similar technology to Xbox Kinect and is the first of it's kind in the world.  \n\nThis video will demonstrate how to use the Virtual Mirror Augmented Reality application.  The video shows a young fashionista using the application to try on and buy fashion accessories online.  \n\nThe Virtual Mirror enables customers to browse online and try on fashion accessories such as bracelets, earrings and necklaces before deciding to buy.  Unlike any previous technology, the virtual mirror used by Boutique Accessories only requires a computer & webcam, and integrates directly with Facebook.  This is a big step away from catalogue-style e-shopping, and much closer to a real high street shopping experience. \n\nThe webcam image acts like a mirror, allowing you to move around while trying on the fashion accessories.  If you like the item, you can take a photo and share it with your friends on Facebook, asking for their feedback and making the experience much more like a shopping trip with a friend.\n\nUsing cutting edge tracking technology similar to the new Xbox Kinect, the Virtual Mirror uses key points on your face and neck to map the fashion accessories onto you in the correct position.   It also detects body and face movements allowing you to move around wearing the jewellery.\n\nAbout www.BoutiqueAcessories.com.au\n\nwww.BoutiqueAccessories.com.au is an online boutique selling Australian Designer Fashion Accessories including Earrings, Necklaces, Bracelets, Handbags and Purses. \n\nOur mission is to recreate a high-end Boutique experience online by over delivering on customer's expectations and providing cutting edge technology to constantly improve the online experience.

It can be pedunculated or sessile but you always find a continous cortex and marrow from the underlying bone.\nIt has a cartilaginous cap and sometimes you find calcifications at the chondro-osseous portion.\nIt is mostly discovered in the first 3 decates and after skeletal maturation the tumor will stop growing.\n\nIn most cases the tumor is asymptomatic and only when very large or situated at an unfavorable location it can cause nerve or vascular compression or pressure errosions of adjacent bones. Also in case of a fracture or inflammations of the bursa above the cartilaginous cap a new pain can occur.\n\nVery seldom, in less than 1%, there is the possibility of a malignant transformation. A sign for a malignant transformation is a cartilage cap thicker than 2cm as well as calcifications within the cartilage cap.\n\nOnly in case of hereditary multiple exostosis the chance of a malignant transformation is as high as 10% especially if located in the shoulder or pelvis region.\n\nIf it is not possible to identify the contigious cortex and medullary cavity on a conventional radiograph you might consider differential diagnosis like a peri- oder parosteal osteosarcoma or the myositis ossificans. In this case a CT scan should follow in order to clarify the diagnosis.\n\nIf there are now signs of malignant transformation like new onset of pain that can't be explained by fracture or bursitis, a thickend cartilage cap or calcifications within the cap there is no need for surgical resection unless there are complains due to irritation of adjacents structures.", "title": "Osteochondroma or osteocartilaginous exostosis, tumor in CT scan by RadiologyTV", "publishedDate": "2014-04-29T08:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bF_bSizRTA", "description": "The Western Suffolk BOCES School of Esthetics is a NYS-approved, affordable, hands-on program that helps prepare adults to take the New York State licensing exam for esthetics.

Die Entwicklung des Embryos/ F\u00f6tus/ Babys wird genau beschrieben. \nQuelle: Babycenter\nDie Schwangerschaft beginnt ab dem ersten Tag der letzten Regelblutung. Sie dauert 40 Wochen, also 10 Monate. \nWie l\u00e4uft die Geburt ab?\nIm achten Monat k\u00f6nnen Vorwehen 4 bis 5 mal in der Stunde auftreten. Dabei zieht sich die Geb\u00e4rmutter zusammen. Im neunten Monat k\u00f6nnen Senkwehen auftreten, dabei rutscht das Baby tiefer ins Becken. Au\u00dferdem wird der Bauch etwas kleiner. Die Abst\u00e4nde der Wehen werden immer k\u00fcrzer und der Muttermund \u00f6ffnet sich. Dabei plazt die Fruchtblase. Nun wird es Zeit ins Krankenhaus zu fahren. Denn nun kommen die Presswehen. Diese unterst\u00fctzen die Mutter beim Pressen. Die Geburt empfindet sie als gro\u00dfe Schmerzen. Nach der Geburt schreit das Baby und f\u00fcllt damit seine Lungen mit Luft. Nun wird die Nabelschnur durchgeschnitten und das Baby untersucht. Kurz darauf beginnen die Nachwehen. Dabei werden Mutterkuchen und so ausgesto\u00dfen und die Geb\u00e4rmutter wird wieder kleiner. Nach der Gebur wiegt die Mutter 7 Killogramm weniger. Nun muss sich die Mutter und ihr Baby von der Geburt erholen. Bei der Mutter kann dies bis zu 6 Wochen dauern. Bei der Geburt wiegt das Baby etwa 3000 bis 3500 Gramm und ist 50 Zentimeter gro\u00df.", "title": "Die Geburt eines Babys", "publishedDate": "2013-04-04T11:54:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bGYZszOk2g", "description": "http://www.mediafire.com/?ukxe6qy66qvjft9", "title": "BAKE FOWL AND BREADFRUIT.wmv", "publishedDate": "2011-12-04T01:26:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bG_OMBTLR8", "description": "Professor X demands Storm use her powers not to fight Magneto but to ensure he has a perfect golf game this weekend.

Ben hat schon lange keine Zeit mehr alleine mit seinem geschiedenen Vater verbracht, dieser ist ihm ebenso fremd wie seine neue Umgebung. Doch w\u00e4hrend er sich mit Marrakech immer mehr anfreundet, wird die Distanz zu seinem Vater gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Alte Wunden rei\u00dfen wieder auf und neue Streitigkeiten entstehen. Allein die Frage ob er verantwortungsbewusst mit seinem Diabetes umgeht, reicht bereits aus, um einen Streit zu entfachen. Statt m\u00fchselig mit seinem Vater zusammen zu sein, geht Ben lieber auf Erkundungstouren au\u00dferhalb des Luxushotels. In einem Nachtclub lernt er die junge Karima (Hafsia Herzi) kennen und verliebt sich in sie. Ben reist mit seiner neuen Liebe in ihr abgelegenes Heimatdorf, das sich inmitten des Atlasgebirges befindet. Sein Vater Heinrich f\u00e4ngt unterdessen an, sich Sorgen zu machen und macht sich auf die Suche nach Ben. Dabei beschleichen ihn zunehmende \u00c4ngste und Sorgen um seinen verschwundenen Sohn. \n\n---\n\nTags: Exit Marrakech Trailer german HD, Exit Marrakech Trailer deutsch HD, Exit Marrakech deutscher Trailer HD, Exit Marrakech Kino-Trailer HD, Exit Marrakech Kinotrailer HD, Exit Marrakech Filmkritik HD\n\n---\n\nAlle Angaben ohne Gew\u00e4hr.\nUploaded with permission of / Property of:\nTM & (c) 2103 StudioCanal Deutschland.

Former second-in-command of the Kron-X organized crime syndicate. A man running from a 400 year prison sentence awaiting him on Earth. And so Jake Barnes hightails it off-planet to the Moon, where Terran laws do not apply. The Moon, an irradiated wasteland where the slightest mistakes can be fatal. The Moon, home to eccentric solid rocket tycoon and former \u00fcber-space-hero Austin Bonner, the only man known to carry nuclear weapons for personal defense. It is a decision that Jake will have frequent opportunities to regret... \n\nJake Barnes, Lunar Freebooter is a hard (realistic) science fiction novella with a focus on the practical realities of what life on the Moon would actually entail. There is no warp drive, no light sabers, no transporters, just rockets and equipment based on actual present or near-future technology. Technology we know would actually work. Additionally, the realities of resources on the Moon and the realities of living with radiation and vacuum are addressed with as much realism as current science makes possible. \n\nIt's not all about science and tech though. First and foremost Jake Barnes, Lunar Freebooter is an adventure, with a good dose of humor thrown in. Readers of Heinlein's \"The Rolling Stones\" or \"Rocket Ship Galileo\" might find in this the kind of practical sleeves-rolled-up can-do science fiction they have been missing.\n\n********************************************\n\nYou can get the book on CreateSpace or Amazon, it is slightly cheaper on Amazon but the price difference is taken out of my cut. So if you want to support me in my quest to bring you more hard science fiction, buy at CreateSpace. A kindle version is coming soon, and if you buy the paperback, you get the Kindle version free through MatchBook!\n\nhttps://www.createspace.com/4449024\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jake-Barnes-Lunar-Freebooter-Moon/dp/1492766739/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379755235&sr=8-1&keywords=Jake+Barnes%2C+Lunar+Freebooter\n\nAlso if you get a copy, do me a favor and write a review on Amazon!

Though it's zero degrees outside, warmth and laughter radiate from the bedroom where Tammy is laboring.  Tammy and her husband Tim are surrounded by family, friends and their professional midwives as she prepares to give birth to their third child at home.\n\nThis is their second homebirth experience for this couple.  Each time they were attended by Julie Havener and Chris Yentes of First Light Community Midwives.\n\nThe birth is juxtaposed with scenes from a lively pre-natal visit, as well as personal interviews.  In these candid discussions, Tammy and Tim address important issues surrounding birth, including fear, personal and cultural expectations around birth, allowing others to help and how homebirth can be healing.\n\nThis film shows how quality midwifery care and support--and a woman's intuition about and relationship to her own body--can make all the difference in her birthing experience.

Big reptiles in public park.\n\n\nGuayaquil - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil\n\nEcuador - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador\n\nIguania - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguania\n\nLizards - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizards\n\nMap - http://tinyurl.com/3xu8jsb\n\nMade with Sony DSC-V1\u2028\u2028\n\nPhotos on \u202ahttp://www.jurajmitas.com\n\n\nLIZARDS - are a very large and widespread group of squamate reptiles, with nearly 3800 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales), which are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the anguimorph lizards from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.\nLizards typically have limbs and external ears, while snakes lack both these characteristics. However, because they are defined negatively as excluding snakes, lizards have no unique distinguishing characteristic as a group. Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the sphenodonts, which have a more primitive and solid diapsid skull. Many lizards can detach their tails to escape from predators, an act called autotomy, but this trait is not shared by all lizards. Vision, including color vision, is particularly well developed in most lizards, and most communicate with body language or bright colors on their bodies as well as with pheromones. The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimetres for some chameleons and geckos to nearly three metres (9 feet, 6 inches) in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo Dragon. Some extinct varanids reached great size. The extinct aquatic mosasaurs reached 17 metres, and the giant monitor Megalania prisca is estimated to have reached perhaps seven metres.\n\n\nGUAYAQUIL - officially Santiago de Guayaquil, is the largest and the most populous city in Ecuador, with a metro area population exceeding 3.3 million[citation needed] at the end of 2009, as well as that nation's main port. The city is the capital of the Ecuadorian province of Guayas and the seat of the namesake canton.\nGuayaquil is located on the western bank of the Guayas River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Guayaquil. Because of its location, the city is the center of Ecuador's business and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nECUADOR - (pronounced /\u02c8\u025bkw\u0259d\u0254r/ , officially the Republic of Ecuador (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador; pronounced [re\u02c8pu\u03b2lika \u00f0el ekwa\u02c8\u00f0or], which literally translates to the Republic of the Equator) is a representative democratic republic in South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and by the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is one of only two countries in South America, along with Chile, that do not have a border with Brazil. The country also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) west of the mainland.", "title": "Big reptiles in public park 1 - Guayaquil  (Ecuador)", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T08:57:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bgoyjZNZdM", "description": "http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nTen years after Congress gave the go-ahead to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, one of the government's most ambitious and complex technology programs is in trouble.

TH-302 is a novel 2-nitroimidazole prodrug of the DNA alkylator bromo-isophosphoramide mustard that is selectively activated under hypoxia. Synergistic induction of apoptosis in MM cells by TH-302 and bortezomib was shown in MM models in vivo and in vitro (Hu et al, Mol Cancer Ther 2013). An ongoing Phase 1/2 study investigates TH-302 with dex in RR MM. In the dose-escalation stage of the study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of biweekly TH-302 was established at 340 mg/m2 and preliminary activity was reported based on the modified IMWG guidelines (Ghobrial et al., ASH 2013).

The kneecap is called the patella, so patellar tendonitis is inflammation of the tendon that extends from the patella down to the shinbone.  \n\nPatellar tendonitis can be caused from a direct impact on or a sudden exertion of the knee.  For instance, if you are in a car crash and your knee gets buckled up underneath you, your quadriceps might suddenly flex and that would strain the tendon in your kneecap.  Regardless of what causes your patellar tendonitis, it is an incredibly painful condition.  We see patellar tendonitis most often in people over the age of 40 because the patellar tendon degrades over time.  The body's natural wear and tear leaves you more susceptible to developing tendonitis or inflammation of the knee as you age.  \n\nIf you have sustained a knee injury in any kind of serious accident in Oregon and don't know what comes next, feel free to call the experienced personal injury attorneys at Dwyer Williams Potter Personal Injury Attorneys at 888-247-9023.  We can explain the legal process and help you get the settlement you deserve.", "title": "Patellar Tendonitis - Kneecap Accident Injuries", "publishedDate": "2013-04-05T20:32:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bjRWqtfu_E", "description": "Track 1 from the eponymous debut", "title": "The Order of the Solar Temple - Fallout Woman", "publishedDate": "2013-08-23T10:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bk1uv-LglQ", "description": "Israeli police block more than 200 far-right Israeli protesters from rushing guests at a wedding of a Jewish woman and Muslim man.\n\nFull Story:\n\nIsraeli police on Sunday blocked more than 200 far-right Israeli protesters from rushing guests at a wedding of a Jewish woman and Muslim man as they shouted \"death to the Arabs\" in a sign of tensions stoked by the Gaza war.\n\nSeveral dozen police, including members of the force's most elite units, formed human chains to keep the protesters from the wedding hall's gates and chased after many who defied them. Four protesters were arrested, and there were no injuries.\n\nA lawyer for the couple, Maral Malka, 23, and Mahmoud Mansour, 26, both from the Jaffa section of Tel Aviv, had unsuccessfully sought a court order to bar the protest. He obtained backing for police to keep protesters 200 metres from the wedding hall in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion.\n\nThe protest highlighted a rise in tensions between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel in the past two months amid a month-long Gaza war, the kidnap and slaying of three Israeli teens in June followed by a revenge choking and torching to death of a Palestinian teen in the Jerusalem area.\n\nA group called Lehava, which organised the wedding demonstration, has harassed Jewish-Arab couples in the past, often citing religious grounds for their objections to intermarriage. But they have rarely protested at the site of a wedding.\n\nThe groom told Israel's Channel 2 TV the protesters failed to derail the wedding or dampen its spirit. \"We will dance and be merry until the sun comes up. We favour coexistence,\" he said.\n\nProtesters, many of them young men wearing black shirts, denounced Malka, who was born Jewish and converted to Islam before the wedding, as a \"traitor against the Jewish state,\" and shouted epithets of hatred towards Arabs including \"death to the Arabs.\" They sang a song that urges, \"May your village burn down.\"\n\nOne protester, Ofer Golan, said: \"It's time that the Muslim will leave Israel. That's it. This is a Jewish country, they don't belong here, they don't have to be here. They have 22 countries; they can go anywhere they like. And we will help, and we will take them in my car there is no problem. It's time that this country will be a Jewish country.\"\n\nA few dozen left-wing Israelis held a counter-protest nearby holding flowers, balloons and a sign that read: \"Love conquers all.\"\n\n\"It is a democracy matter, it is something that I came to say this is the country of Israel, yes it's a Jewish state but it is also a democratic state,\" said one of the counter-protesters Merav Ronen. \"People cannot live their lives according to what anybody else tells them. They have the right to do whatever they want. They came here to ruin their special day. And we came here to stand quietly to give out flowers to tell them that we support them and their choices and it's up to them.\"\n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin, sworn in last month to succeed Shimon Peres, criticised the protest as a \"cause for outrage and concern\" in a message on his Facebook page.\n\n\"Such expressions undermine the basis of our coexistence here, in Israel, a country that is both Jewish and democratic,\" Rivlin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud bloc, said.\n\nLehava spokesman and former lawmaker Michael Ben-Ari denounced Jews intermarrying with non-Jews of any denomination as \"worse than what Hitler did,\" alluding to the murder of 6 million Jews across Europe in World War Two.\n\nA surprise wedding guest was Israel's health minister, Yael German, a centrist in Netanyahu's government. She told reporters as she headed inside that she saw the wedding and the protest against it as \"an expression of democracy.\"\n\nArab citizens make up about 20 percent of Israel's majority Jewish population, and the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Muslims. Rabbinical authorities who oversee most Jewish nuptials in Israel object to intermarriage fearing it will diminish the ranks of the Jewish people.\n\nMany Israeli couples who marry out of their faith do so abroad.\n\nMalka's father, Yoram Malka, said on Israeli television he objected to the wedding, calling it \"a very sad event.\" He said he was angry that his daughter had converted to Islam. Of his now son-in-law, he said, \"My problem with him is that he is an Arab.\"\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Israeli Wedding of Jew, Muslim Draws Protesters amid War Tensions", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T13:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bk2S3D-68A", "description": "DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN DINOSAURS", "title": "PL EXAM 2: DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN DINOSAURS.avi", "publishedDate": "2013-02-18T04:31:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bkSsIAa12E", "description": "", "title": "SFI Kinetic VT BILLYHO WScreen", "publishedDate": "2014-05-29T23:48:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "7bkghlAi4Y8", "description": "\u25aa Men Of Respect rapping on Haywyre's song Sedative Shapes.

The last one I participated in was Kelsi the Asshole. This particular type of scam is called the romance scam because it starts with dating sites. Gorgeous young girls (or just their photos and vids, in reality they are probably skanky degenerate men with hygiene problems) hit on lonely, vulnerable guys and sucker them with promises of undying love, but first they have to pay for Daddy's cancer surgery, or funeral expenses, etc. These people are usually dumber than a dead slug, hence the reuse of the same videos, sometimes even with the same target. They also do not keep their photos consistent from one webpage to their yahoo chat, as if nobody is going to notice. In my case I turn the tables. I have several skype accounts and when I finish humiliating them be shoving their stupidity in their face, often triggering a defensive display of cursing and swearing, or a childish pretense and show of feigned indifference or laughter, I re emerge on another user account and start the process over, I will often simply upload both photos, of different stolen jpegs, at which point they sign off. But if I have time I will have a little fun. What I will do here is when I chat with \"Kelsi\" again I will paste this URL, and she will see that she's been outed. I should also say that there are two clips of the same video, although one is frozen at the beginning, no doubt she couldn't get it to play at first. Each of these clips was taken from a different skype user name chat with Kelsi.There are no doubt  posts on other websites with some of the same fake photos and vids. I know I saw this one on facebook somewhere. There is a point in each of these clips in which the person waves exactly the smae wave. Notice how she pretends to read a message, but I'm not typing, I'm filming her. Smiling so sweetly at the nice things I'm saying. Oh, and they're ALL from Ghana. that's another stupidity on their part - since Ghana is widely known for this stuff, as soon as any of them says they're from Ghana you KNOW what's coming.

She attributes that positive outlook to her MD Anderson care team, led by Kathleen Schmeler, M.D., assistant professor in Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine.\n\n\"Thank God for MD Anderson,\" says Diana. \"Otherwise, I'm certain that right now I wouldn't be here.\"\n\nIt all began Dec. 16, 2010, a day that did not go as Diana had planned. Good intentions of helping her sister move furniture led to a pulled abdominal muscle, a trip to the emergency room and a CAT scan that revealed a much more serious concern. \n\nIronically, it was a year to the day since Diana had lost her husband to complications from diabetes.\n\n\"It was a hard time for me,\" she says. \n\nFrom the emergency room, Diana went to MD Anderson, where further tests showed not one but many tumors \u2014 on her liver, intestine, spine and elsewhere.\n\n\"I was surprised at how much the cancer had spread, but Dr. Schmeler gave me options from the very beginning,\" says Diana. \n\nShe underwent chemotherapy followed by surgery and \"a few more chemotherapy sessions.\"\n\n\"Everything looked fine,\" says Diana. \"I was gradually back into the swing of things. I was getting my hair back, and I went to my daughter's graduation from culinary school.\"\n\nIn September 2011, Diana returned to MD Anderson, and \"there it was, this stubborn tumor that wouldn't go away.\"\n\nDiana continues to fight back, grateful to have choices with each new round of chemotherapy and radiation. \n\n\"There's always hope, and you're never out of options,\" says Diana. \"That's what keeps me going.\"\n\nDiana, whose family has a history of cancer, has tested positive for the BRCA1 gene. That knowledge, she says, is a powerful prevention tool for her two grown daughters.\n\n\"I want my children to be proactive with this test so they can prevent getting stage 4 cancer,\" she says.\n\nSince her diagnosis, Diana has been concerned at the lack of funds for ovarian cancer research. She had a cause to champion when she heard that MD Anderson had selected high-grade serous ovarian cancer for the Moon Shots Program.\n\n\"My solution is raising awareness of my type of cancer and of the need for philanthropic dollars to support much needed research,\" she says. \"Research is important. It gives me options.\"\n\nMD Anderson is synonymous with hope, says Diana.\n\n\"I put my life on hold the year after my husband passed away,\" she says. \"But I realized I have to keep living. I have faith in MD Anderson \u2014 it gives me the hope and the strength to keep going.\"\n\nFor more information and to make a donation, visit: cancermoonshots.org", "title": "Stories of Hope: Diana Castillo-Chow, High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Patient", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T23:15:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cR-cO54Jdo", "description": "Two men in rubber masks attempted to rob a grocery store.

Tiny baby Roona Begum was rushed to hospital after a condition called Hydrocephalus caused her skull to fill with fluid and balloon to a staggering 94 centimetres. At it's worst it weighed 7 kilos - half the little girl's weight - and the baby girl's life was in serious danger. And after her pictures were sent across the world caring medics at private hospital the Fortis Healthcare Group, in New Delhi, offered to operate on Roona for free. Now they have managed to slowly reduce the size of the toddler's head by almost 11 cm after a week of painstaking draining the cerebrospinal fluid from her skull. And it is hoped the treatment has given her a real chance of survival.\n\nVideographer / Director: Sagar Kaul\nProducers: James Tegerdine / Basit Umer\nEditor: Ben Churcher\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the Barcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp\nLike Barcroft Media on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/RJlaj6\nFollow Barcroft Media on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9", "title": "New Hope For Swollen Head Baby", "publishedDate": "2013-05-06T19:09:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "7cRvr8FKVQo", "description": "During the Grand Prix of Middelharnis I have recorded this amazing Ariel Atom.
