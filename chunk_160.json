The family was soon extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems in a commercial aircraft. It was also the first, and currently the only, narrow body aircraft in the Airbus lineup.\n\nWith over 4,000 built and an additional 2,400 on order as of November 2009, the Airbus A320 family is Airbus's best-selling aircraft to date.

Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is a police detective who, after discovering the aftermath of a particularly gruesome murder, is convinced that Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is up to his ugly tricks again. Matthews' hunch turns out to be correct, but the master criminal proves to be disconcertingly easy to capture. As it happens, Jigsaw is eager to be put behind bars in order to throw the authorities off his trail as he once again punishes people who in his eyes have transgressed the boundaries of acceptable moral behavior. But instead of trapping two people in a filthy dungeon where they must engage in a terrible contest in order to win their freedom, eight people have been locked away by Jigsaw, and they must torture their bodies and minds to achieve the terrible justice Jigsaw seeks.

Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin described a \"tickle\" as two different types of phenomena.[3] One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type of tickle, called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation. Another type of tickle is the laughter-inducing \"heavy\" tickle, produced by repeatedly applying pressure to \"ticklish\" areas, and is known as gargalesis. Such sensations can be pleasurable or exciting, but are sometimes considered highly unpleasant, particularly in the case of relentless heavy tickling.\n\nThe question as to why a person could not tickle him/herself was raised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.[4]\n\nFrancis Bacon and Charles Darwin belie", "title": "AJ stomp 2", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T20:33:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "94qr232R5yc", "description": "FRI 10/25/13\nHurdle Happy Hour on a Friday evening!

However, in this particular case, the issuance of the fatwa has not only religious but political force as well as the leader in the Islamic Republic is the prime decision-maker.\n\nThe recent P5+1 talks, which the US officials hailed as \"a step forward\" and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton described as \"constructive and useful\", were held in an ambience filled with optimism this fatwa inspired. Although the ten-hour talks between Iran and the six world powers apparently bore no tangible fruits, the two sides ended the talks with an air of sanguinity in a feel-good atmosphere. Further to that, the two sides seemed resolute to put an end to the long-standing dispute so stubbornly dragged on for years by the West.\n\nSome Iranian officials have expressed hope and optimism the next round of talks slated to be held in Baghdad on May 23 will come to fruition.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told reporters in Zagreb, Croatia, on Wednesday, \"We are optimistic about the future of negotiations and want the other sides to put their words into action.\"\n\nThe western pessimistic glasses have cast a dark haze over Iran's nuclear energy program, making long-standing efforts to inculcate that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapons program.\n\nBe it as it may, there is no point in believing that Iran is seeking to produce nuclear weapons as there is no evidence whatsoever pointing to this notion. Besides, modern history has proved that Iran has never been an aggressor; rather it has become a victim of aggression. During the Iran-Iraq war in 1983, the Iraqis used mustard gas, and in March 1984, they used tabun, a nerve agent used for the first time in war. The corrupt regime of Saddam Hussein continued to use chemical weapons until the end of war in August 1988 in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the use of chemical weapons. They also used the nerve agent sarin. \nLINK FOR REST", "title": "IRAN Ayatollah Khamenei Re-Issues Fatwa Against Nuclear Weapons \"A Grave Sin\" Feb/22/2012", "publishedDate": "2012-06-11T23:05:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "95Hw269bjZ8", "description": "Cool shot i had on tiger woods 2012", "title": "Tiger Woods 2012 Gene Sarazen Master's Moment", "publishedDate": "2011-04-20T00:23:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "95I4d-bmLls", "description": "The specter of Big Brother looms larger by each hour.

Fox) doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father (Crispin Glover) and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now-teenaged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset. Back to the Future cemented the box-office bankability of both Fox and the film's director, Robert Zemeckis, who went on to helm two equally exhilarating sequels.\n\n\"back to the future\",\"back to the future clip\",\"back to the future theme\",\"back to the future part 1\",\"michael j fox\",\"crispin glover\",\"thomas f wilson\",\"billy zane\",\"casey siemaszko\",\"jj cohen\",\"donald fullilove\",\"robert zemeckis\",\"bicycle videos\",\"cup videos\",\"ages 11-12\",\"ages 8-10\",\"children family\",\"family comedies\",\"family sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++3671,/m/0hz_1,/m/023n39,/m/03d_qmm,/m/026_w2h,/m/05zs3q0,/m/06nts3,/m/01vxxb", "title": "Back to the Future (4/10) Movie CLIP - You're George McFly!

The fins are all blue-green in color, having yellow and light blue trim. It has a lyre shaped caudal fin with a yellow bar between the lobes. Like all trigger fish red-toothed triggers have a retractable dorsal spine.\nTheir pectoral fins are quite small; as a result they swim mostly with their dorsal and anal fins, which makes them not so fast, but very maneuverable.\n\nBehavior\n\nIt inhabits open waters and current-swept seaward reefs between 0 to 35 metres (0-115 feet) and can often be seen in groups turning and circling just under the sea surface while feeding on plankton brought in by the current. Sponges are another part of their menu.\n\nIn the Aquarium\n\nOdonus niger is a hardy member of a saltwater aquarium. It has a reputation as one of the most peaceful of the triggerfish. It is still however a triggerfish and can therefore not be easily kept in an aquarium with invertebrates, although careful selection of invertebrates sometimes can make it possible to keep in a reef aquarium.

I used relatively inexpensive battery powered flash units bouncing off of umbrellas to keep the lights soft and very diffuse.  Although you could use very simple, cheap tungsten lights that you can find even in a pet store.  Clamp reflectors with big dishes and you could spin a could of 500-watt tungsten bulbs in there and do basically the same thing.  \n\nNow I have the lights criss-crossing like this so I don't get a harsh shadow on one side or the other, and the lights tend to fill each other in, in the backgrounds.\n\nGet everybody sitting close together and it helps if you've got somebody standing behind you to amuse the small people who are very easily distracted.  \n\nHey.  Hello.  Everybody looking at Joe.  That's great, that's great, that's great, that's great.  Look at you.  I can't believe that this is actually working.  Yay.  Mom, move the child.  There you go.  That's great, that's great.  Everybody looks fabulous.\n\nDon't try to photograph everybody from way up in the air.  Get down where their eyes are.  \n\nThat's terrific.  Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.  Everybody put your finger in your mouth.  There we go.  Everybody put your finger in your mouth without choking the children.   Very nice.  Okay, take the fingers out of the mouth.  \n\nWhenever you're photographing small children, the best advice in the world is surrender the illusion of control.  Just keep shooting and shooting and shooting because it's the only way you're going to make sure you get everybody with their eyes open and you get that one moment when everybody's kind of looking at your and smiling.\n\nSmall children don't always need to smile but it's better if they're looking at you than away from you.  \n\nHello.  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.  Look at you.  Absolutely fabulous.  \n\nAnd that's how you shoot a family portrait indoors.", "title": "How to Shoot Family Portraits Inside | Portrait Photography", "publishedDate": "2013-12-03T03:18:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "96-N8aUH0t4", "description": "A320 landing in excessive turbulence at Andaman Islands", "title": "A320 Landing at Andaman & Nicobar Islands", "publishedDate": "2008-07-09T07:45:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "96-v_eq6D8M", "description": "Maurice Asola-Fadola, responsible for defrauding at least 19 British women out of hundreds of thousands of pounds through elaborate international romance frauds has been jailed in Ghana.

These can be treated with a laser as soon as they are diagnosed, and early treatment is key. The laser wavelength is absorbed by the oxyhemoglobin (the protein molecules that make blood red) in the blood vessels of hemangioma resulting in the shrinking of the vessels so that the result is a less noticeable lesion. Repeated treatments can almost completely remove superficial hemangiomas. \n\nSince the blood vessels of cavenous hemangiomas are much deeper below the surface of the skin than superficial ones it is necessary to use a laser that can penetrate much deeper to selectively target the vessels of the lesion without causing damage to the surrounding tissue. \n\nFotona's lasers that combine a KTP laser with a long pulse Nd:YAG laser offer the perfect solution to vascular lesions such as hemangiomas. The KTP laser emits a green laser at a wavelength that is absorbed in oxyhemoglobin in order to treat superficial hemangiomas effectively. The long pulse Nd:YAG laser penetrates to a depth of 5-6 mm into the skin allowing the effective treatment of cavenous hemangiomas. Independent research shows that over 75% of patients with deep hemangiomas that are treated with the Nd:YAG laser see a dramatic regression in the lesion.\n\nhttp://www.fotona.com", "title": "NdYAG Hemangioma Treatment", "publishedDate": "2009-08-14T08:15:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "964rEJ8KsoI", "description": "Brad Pitt guest on Real Time with Bill Maher, \nSocialism and Town Hall Meetings.\n\n\"If I found myself that vitriolic and that emotional, I would check myself first\"\n\"Trust me, You don't know Socialism till you've been there, We're Fine\"", "title": "Brad Pitt Responds to Socialism in America", "publishedDate": "2009-08-18T16:09:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "965H8195V0M", "description": "", "title": "Dungeon Elite [**] - Monochromatic (@ honky tonky seregno)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-23T00:44:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "965pzY3waSE", "description": "Funny Racist Commercial", "title": "Funny Racist Commercial", "publishedDate": "2010-11-25T17:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "965yQxwbK1M", "description": "Please subscribe to my family channel: FoolyLiving.

I've been painting since a teenager, and I've been doing it for 20 years now. Find me at Paes164.com (p-a-e-s-164.com) My Facebook is facebook.com/paes_art. Lets start off with a throw up. Again, just keeping it to kind of a one shot. Keep your can spraying and moving, kinda line you know? Outer outline of the B. Getting it out on the street quick, so you can move. Simple as that. Followed by a 3D, and a quick fill, and you're off to your next letter. Ok, so after the throw up we're going to move up to the blockbuster of the B. Straight forward lines. Nice, straight, big ol' letter B. Ok, lets do a bit of outlining on our blockbuster. Very simple, very straight little bit of 3D action going on. Something that's going to make this letter bold and pop. So when people are driving down the highway they can see it. How about some inner gel time? Good thing about inner gels, you can kind of come off the inner gel and work cracks and what not, through your blockbuster, once again giving it more, your own personal style and touch. Now, we're going to move onto the wild style B. Giving it our own personal touch. Wild style once again, is just taking this letter and twisting it any direction you want, to give it your own little personal look that is going to define your name on the street. After our rough sketch, we just kinda run in and give it a nice fill-in. Right now I'm just using a regular outline tip. Just give it a quick fill in. I'll come back and use the same tip to do my outline and details of the letter. Let's go ahead and add some of those nice pretty stars and things to our letter. I'm just gonna come through, and do some some cool wiggly lines to show you how after I outline and everything, how this will just fall right into the fill in. Fill in is done. Back to the outline. Now we're going to move to our 3D. Kinda got our whole base B outlined. Good spray paint smells like good bananas. Let's do another inner gel. Inner gel B is just the inner outline, around the outline you did around your letter to make the letter pop out. Sometimes getting those long lines in, having them come out real clean- Almost kinda pre-throwing your stroke will help you out a lot. Instead of just maybe running through, actually practice the arm movement so you can get it done in one shot. Final touch. Outer gel, outer outline. And that's pretty much the basis of your wild style, letter B.", "title": "How to Draw a B | Graffiti", "publishedDate": "2011-09-28T16:21:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "96BI-tvMFu0", "description": "This Big Sebaceous Cyst was removed under local anesthesia.This was removed completely without damage.\nThe sebaceous cyst was out intact with the punctum with skin around and an adjacent black mole.\nI opened this sebaceous cyst to see what it contains?\nIt appears soft , indicating liquid material inside the cyst.\nOn opening the sebaceous cyst , it shows full of pus inside.\nThis liquefied pus is infected .\nBut as it was removed without breaking the cyst wall, there is no chance of spread of infection to surrounding tissue.\nThe is also no chance of recurrence in this case as this sebaceous cyst was removed completely", "title": "Big Sebaceous Cyst - Full Of Pus Inside", "publishedDate": "2013-06-15T16:47:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "96BUa5lO5pc", "description": "16 november 2013 - Sporthallen Zuid", "title": "Partyetter @ Pandemonium Physical Readmission deel 5", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T19:29:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "96BupTqHBgc", "description": "Anne Linnet med band spillede 5.10.13 i Gjethuset - her et klip fra sangen \"Hvor du er - vil jeg gerne v\u00e6re\"", "title": "Anne Linnet \"HVOR DU ER\" i Gjethuset", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T21:37:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "96C0brcYiKQ", "description": "kutuzov e seedorf nella pubblicit\u00e0 del posticipo,troppo da ridereee!", "title": "pubblicit\u00e0 SKY milan-bari kutuzov & seedorf", "publishedDate": "2009-09-25T12:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "96C2GCRL6QE", "description": "This very nice home was built at Schult Homes in Redwood Falls MN and is on display at Cyrilla Beach Homes in Paynesville MN.

Most things light INSTANTLY when placed in the beam of this laser! This is the most powerful handheld laser that I've ever used!\n\nNEW!! Even stronger laser that I built! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53GJJHwQ8BA\n\nThis laser uses the new 9mm 450nm laser diode and runs on two 18650 Li Ion batteries. The housing is a custom machined \"Sirius\" host. I usually try to refrain from using the term \"lightsaber\" when referring to my lasers but there really isn't much else out there to describe this laser.\n\nTo be honest I don't even like handheld lasers this strong, but I knew my subscribers would like this! This laser is legal to own in the US, and I wore goggles while shooting this video.\n\nUPDATE: This video is getting a LOT of publicity so I better clear some things up. It is 100% percent legal to build and own a laser like this in the US, the FDA just regulates the sale, import, and operation of these lasers.

And a very beautiful one as well.\"\n\nPhilodendron bipinnatifidum (common names: lacy tree philodendron, selloum) is a plant that belongs to the family Araceae. The commonly used name Philodendron selloum is a synonym (Mayo 1991). This plant is native to South America, namely to Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay but is also cultivated as a landscape plant in the gulf coast and east coast of the United States, such as in Florida. This plant is also cultivated as a landscape plant in tropical Asian countries such as the Philippines.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n\"Monstera is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas. The genus is named from the Latin word for \"monstrous\" or \"abnormal\", the members of the genus are distinguished by their unusual leaves with natural holes.\n\nThey are herbs or evergreen vines, growing to heights of 20 m in trees, climbing by means of aerial roots which act as hooks over branches; these roots will also grow into the soil to help support the plant. The leaves are alternate, leathery, dark green, very large, from 25-90 cm long (up to 130 cm long in M. dubia) and 15-75 cm broad, often with holes in the leaf blade. The flowers are borne on a specialised inflorescence called a spadix, 5-45 cm long; the fruit is a cluster of white berries, edible in some species.\n\nThey are commonly grown indoors as houseplants. The best-known representative of the genus, Monstera deliciosa, is also cultivated for its edible fruit which taste like a combination of banana and pineapple.\"\n\nA tropical rainforest is an ecosystem type that occurs roughly within the latitudes 28 degrees north or south of the equator (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). This ecosystem experiences high average temperatures and a significant amount of rainfall. Rainforests can be found in Asia, Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico and on many of the Pacific, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean islands. Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are thought to be a type of tropical wet forest (or tropical moist broadleaf forest) and may also be referred to as lowland \n This footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

As always he delivers another excellent DVD. I always look forward to Ravi's DVDs as not only are the effects amazing, I find Ravi's passion and enthusiasm a driving force.' - Wayne Goodman 'Collision V2 is a great collection of material using everyday objects. They are clear in effect and you can master them with a little practice. If you like organic magic, then this DVD is for you!' - Fritz Alkemade 'Collision V2 has some of the best organic and visual material I have seen for a long time. It is packed full of workable ideas that you will be foolish not to try out and use! The reactions speak for themselves!' - Marc Lavelle( Magic consultant to the TV series 'Tricked' Ben Hanlin) 'Collision 2 just melted my mind; short snappy straight to the point magic, I love it. 'Residue' is making my number one set' - Kieron Lefever Magician, Pickpocket and Hypnotist Ravi Mayar has released the follow up to his first DVD. This is 'Collision Volume 2'; what organic magic is all about. Ravi has a real knack for making use of normal, everyday objects as part of his repetoire. His tricks are highly visual, easy to do and they get great reactions in the real world. It won't take you an age to competently perform Ravi's effects - invest a short time to practice and then you can deliver accomplished results without any complicated sleight of hand or unnecessary, complex routining. In short, you'll be amazing people before you know it!. So what do you get' Ring A ten phase, powerhouse visual routine, done with just one ring. Each phase is modular leaving you the opportunity to do each phase, one phase or mix them up. Damn Gum Remove a piece of gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe. Simply change it into the inner wrap of the gum package; change it again into a full, store bought pack of gum. Take out a piece of gum, eat it or give the piece to your spectator. S.C.T.B ( Signed Coin Thru Bill ) Borrow a bill, borrow a coin. Have the spectator sign the coin. Fold the bill in half and place the coin inside the bill. Crimp the coin inside the bill so the spectator can see the coin is in there - then, with just your finger tips, pull their signed coin through the bill. Match Take a match out of a match box and light it. Blow on the matchbox and the match goes out in the other hand. Take the match and bite off the burnt tip. Then 'spit blow' the end of the match back onto the matchstick - you'll see the burnt tip, back, on the slightly broken matchstick. Minds Eye Tell the spectator you have made a prediction and that you sent a text message of the prediction to your phone weeks before. Ask the spectator to think of a number between one and five. Show them the text message on your phone. The message will show a list of 5 money denominations and a facial feature next to each denomination. Whatever number the spectator chooses, that denomination is produced from thin air and the facial feature next to the chosen denomination vanishes from the bill. WAIT! It also vanishes from the text message on your phone. Show them the text message with the missing facial feature next to their chosen denomination. Residue Borrow a coin from a spectator. Display both your hands to show that they are empty. Place the coin into their hand instructing them to make a fist . Take out a lighter and wave it under their fist. The spectator then opens their hand to discover their coin is half burnt. Instant Bartender Borrow a coin from a spectator and change it into a miniature bottle of Vodka (or any other spirit). Now produce their coin from thin air and as have them believe the trick is over at this point. NOW, produce a can of Red Bull (or any other soft drink) from your empty hands. Business Travel Take two of your own business cards, fold them and place them inside each other. Slowly, with your finger tips, pull the inside folded card through the other one. Hand out your business cards. Great for self promotion! CONTAC Show both sides of two different flavoured Tictac boxes. Ask the spectator which flavour they prefer. Take one of the Tictac boxes and tap it against the other one and ONLY ONE of the preferred flavoured tictacs suddenly appears in the opposite flavoured Tictac box.", "title": "Collision V2 by Ravi Mayar and MagicTao", "publishedDate": "2014-05-31T02:37:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "96zT-qFbLbI", "description": "Mormon Tabernacle organist Andrew Unsworth performs \"The Washington Post March\" by John Phillip Sousa arranged by Joseph Linger.\n\nEpisode 4339.

But there's one in the Inner Mongolia that stretches more than 60 miles. It's a frustrating ordeal for drivers who move at a snail's pace.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntdtv.org\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C\n\nChinese drivers are stuck in a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam that stretches more than 62 miles on a highway in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This jam has been going on practically non-stop since July 10th.\n\nThe cause? Workers reconstructing and expanding the highway that links Beijing and Tibet.\n\nAn endless line of vehicles, mostly trucks, could be seen crawling along the highway from Ulanqab to the regional capital of Hohhot.\n\nChinese state media reported that motorists took over 40 hours to complete the 62-mile drive.\n\nMany drivers are frustrated that construction could take up to two years to complete... and that there aren't any plans for road diversions or alternate routes.\n\nMany motorists choose to take a risk entering the congested highway. Once caught in a log traffic jam like this, frustrated drivers find few options for escape.\n\n[Stranded Driver]: \n\"I know. But nobody is directing the traffic. It's too difficult to pass through from here.\"\n\nMotorists hope that local police could help divert traffic and post traffic signs ahead of the blocked sections to prevent massive traffic jams like this one.\n\nAlthough motorists know they may face traffic congestion on this highway, this is still the preferred route for many drivers.\n\n[Stranded Truck Driver]: \n\"If I go to Baotou by taking Provincial Highway S31, I would earn nothing. If I wait here, it only costs me some money on meals and I can save fuel. As the toll fees are the same on G6 and Provincial Highway S31, I would rather have my time wasted.\"\n\nSurging coal transportation has been blamed for traffic build-ups on the notoriously congested highway.\n\nLast August it experienced a similar traffic jam, stranding drivers for nine days.

In the modern Bible versions these verses are usually included with a simple note pointing out that they are not in the oldest known manuscripts.\n\nYe shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. 1 Deuteronomy 4:2\n\nWhen it says we must deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Him in three Gospels but the phrase \"take up your cross\" is missing from the fourth Gospel it is unlikely someone reading is going to come to the conclusion that we don't need to take up our cross.\n\nFact remains that all modern translations teach that Yahshua/Jesus is God, that we must believe in Him, and turn from our sins. millions of people own a bible yet they live contrary to the teachings in it, as though God and His will for mankind did not matter, or even exist. Revelation 22:14 \"Blessed are they that DO HIS COMMANDMENTS\". \n\nThere is the fact that false doctrine laces the KJV by the inaccurate translation of certain words from Hebrew and Greek to English. For example the Hebrew word Asherah is translated as grove in the KJV. Then in Acts..Asherah appears under the name of Easter, a pagan goddess condemned in the bible. The message of the KJV is veiled, and misleading.\n\nErasmus was a typical Roman period occultist. Despite his personal sins, the Spirit maintains the word throughout history.\n\nIn the 17th century, King James translators worked from the Erasmus Greek text of the New Testament.

The 48-kilometre \"superhighway for used water\" comprises a network of tunnels, link sewers and pipes from Kranji to Changi, with a centralised water reclamation plant in Changi.\n\nIn Parliament, Dr Balakrishnan announced that work on Phase Two of the system would begin soon.\n\nThe 18-km network, scheduled to be completed by 2022, will serve the western part of Singapore, and come equipped with a new water reclamation plant in Tuas. The plant will come with integrated NEWater facilities. \n\nDr Balakrishnan said Phase Two will further improve Singapore's overall recycling rate and enhance Singapore's water sustainability.\n\nHe also said the second desalination plant in Tuas is due to be completed in July.\n\nThe first was the SingSpring Desalination Plant, which opened in 2005.\n\nDr Balakrishnan said the second desalination plant would add another 70 million gallons of water a day, and in the long run, would meet about a quarter of the nation's total water demand.\n\nHe said: \"Today, we have the four national taps and we are in a secure position. I can give an assurance to the House, we'll certainly be water independent well before the expiry of the last agreement with Malaysia. \n\n\"I can even go even further than that and assure Ms Faizah Jamal, that in fact water is not going to be the limiting factor. You can produce as many babies as you like, you can build as many houses as you like, water will not be limiting factor. We can produce more than enough water for Singapore for the long-term future.\"\n\nHe also gave an update on water prices.\n\n\"The key variable in the future for the cost of water is the cost of energy.

It was designed as a terrain coaster by Werner Stengel and built by Schwarzkopf. Even though it opened in 1977, the ride is one of the most popular and most-ridden coasters in the park, due to its low height requirement.\n\nThe train first goes up a hill, makes a small left turn, and then descends and enters a loop. It then makes a sweeping left turn that travels through the middle of the loop and enters a tunnel. The ride concludes with a series of bunny hills and helixes. The trains on the SooperDooperLooper use a single lap bar to hold riders in the seat. This design works because the forces from the loop (and helix) press riders in their seats, and are a common feature with Schwarzkopf looping coasters. The tunnel that occurs part-way through the ride used to house a mechanical spider prop that would drop down towards the train. The ride opened with three trains.

This is perhaps more important than anything else in life and I am going to tell you why living a good life, full of great relationships is more important than anything else.\n\n85% of your happiness and joy in life will be associated with other people. This means that, of course, 85% of your frustrations and problems in life will be associated with other people as well. In order to be happy in life you must focus on building great relationships with others.\nAn important part of living a wonderful life is for you to remember that relationships are central to your health and happiness. Practice the Golden Rule in all of your relationships. \n\nMake the important people in your life the most important parts of your world. Treat other people with courtesy, kindness and consideration, exactly the way you would like to be treated by them. When you practice the Golden Rule, it will not only help you to be happy by being good to others, it will help others to be happy as well.\n\nThe critical factor in every relationship is the variable of time. The more time you invest to be happy in a relationship, the more important that relationship becomes. Be sure to spend lots of time with the people who are the most important to you. The more time you spend with the people you care about, you will be happy, healthier and more fulfilled as a person.\n\nIn your relationships with other people, here is a special technique you can use. Especially when you feel impatient or angry for any reason, imagine that the other person only has a short time to live, and you are the only one who knows about it. What would you do differently?\n\nHere is a great YouTube video about how I am able to keep a great relationship with my wife and we are both able to be happy. How can you apply these things to your life to cultivate great relationships?\n\n\n_____________\n\nLearn more: \nSubscribe to my channel for free stuff, tips and more!\nYouTube: http://budurl.com/zwvf\nTranscript here: http://budurl.com/y3sk\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/BrianTracyPage\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/BrianTracy\nGoogle+: +BrianTracyOfficialPag\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/BrianTracy\nInstagram: @TheBrianTracy\nLinkedIn: \nTumbr:\nBlog: http://www.briantracy.com/blog\n\n_____________", "title": "How to Cultivate Great Relationships", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T23:00:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "97kpedN5CtI", "description": "Highlights of the soft launch of the new SRDC Silver Dirham coins with the new 3D minting technology at Exilon V. \n\nwww.dankhoo.com", "title": "SRDC Dirham Launch [Highlights]", "publishedDate": "2011-08-09T23:49:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "97l-pNSzcoU", "description": "The concept of trusteeship for the future is fundamental to human welfare, yet scarcely receives attention in today's educational curricula. This concept, which is stressed alike by religion, philosophy and law, underlines the fact that every generation, far from being in a position of ownership or overlordship, is in a position of trusteeship for generations yet to come. Unfortunately it is the concept of dominion rather than trusteeship which is prevalent throughout the world. \n\nAn important initiative which the Centre has taken towards the achievement of its objectives is the institution of Training For Trusteeship workshops which are held to train future leaders of the country in the concept that they have duties to the community to the environment and to future generations. The concept of trusteeship is emphasised to bring home to them the notion of responsible management of our inherited culture and resources for the benefit of those who are to come after us.\n\nThe trainees selected for this purpose are the final year students of all the Universities in the country and the programme brings together students from all disciplines, all regions, all cultural groups and all backgrounds so that they can spend four days together, coming to understand each other and working out how to participate in common projects aimed at the future betterment of Sri Lanka and its people.", "title": "Training For Trusteeship 2009 - Part 2", "publishedDate": "2011-07-12T12:42:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "97l-rOwiQ9c", "description": "Nebluv, produced by Dashiell -  - uploaded via http://www.mp32u.net/", "title": "- Top Lady feat.

In\nthis method, the boundary is treated as a continuous transition between\nadjacent grains across a thin layer of finite thickness. The value of a \nphase-field variable then identifies the location of the boundary and of\neach grain.

But before remedies, it is important to know what it is and how it takes place. The symptoms help to get an easy cure to the problem.\n\nWhat Are Gall Bladder Stones?\nGallstones are the concretion that is formed in the gall bladder in the binary track. The disease is referred as Cholelithiasis in medical terms. A minute solid structure gets accumulated in gall bladder which is found to be having the shape of the stone. This is a combination of cholesterol and bile pigment which is hardened to form stone particles. The size of gall stone can vary a lot and from being minute, it can reach a size of a golf ball. These stones are categorized based on the content it is formed by like the cholesterol or the pigment.\n\nTwo Types Of Gall Bladder Stones:\n1.    Cholesterol Stones:\n\nThey are formed by hardening of cholesterol and they are very commonly seen gallbladder stones. They are usually yellow \u2013 green in color.\n\n2.    Pigment Stones:\n\nThey are less common and they are due to the pigment bilirubin. They are usually smaller in size compared to cholesterol stones and are dark in color.\n\nThese stones are found to be formed in an organ called gallbladder which is located under the liver. This organ gains much importance as it aids in digesting fatty foods like oil and fats.  The main work of the gallbladder is to store the secreted bile juice which is released to the small intestine when the food from stomach enters the intestine. The Bile is produced in liver which is found to be a combination of different salts, cholesterol as well as bilirubin along with bile salts in it.\n\nThe loss of function of gall bladder takes place due to gallbladder stones. This might also cause fibrosis as well as might stop gallbladder from working in a right manner. The risk of cancer can also be seen due to these stones. Non-functioning gall bladder is known as Chronic Cholecystitis.  The surgery is the only way for some of the cases of gallbladder and this is done only if there is no other way to sort the problem. This includes the procedures like removal of gallbladder (Cholecystectomy) and is done as Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\nThe gallstone is found to be having specificity and the risk of this varies from men to women. The study shows it to be occurring more in men than women and it is about 20% for men below 50 and more than 50% for above 50 to 75 years. In women, it is only 25% for those who are above 60 and 50% for those who are above 75 years of age. This is quite common for women who undertake hormone replacement therapy and those who are pregnant.", "title": "Natural Home Remedies for Gallbladder Stones", "publishedDate": "2014-10-04T12:33:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "98-0HM0xAEI", "description": "Welcome to netstrikers.com\n\nIn this tutorial we will learn how to calculate the square of any 3 digit number.\nfor more info and updates : http://www.netstrikers.com/", "title": "Vedic Maths Tutorial : Calculate Square of any 3 digit number", "publishedDate": "2014-07-05T05:39:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "980Erz1oUos", "description": "Orthopaedic Science Lab\nhttp://www.orthop.washington.edu/?q=research/osl/orthopaedic-science-laboratories.html\nTracking of Bone Loss Through Serial \u00b5-CT Image Registration\nThe goal of this study is to track the onset and migration of bone loss induced by transient muscle paralysis with the hopes of using this data to elucidate the drivers of osteoclastic bone resorption in this model.

The film takes place in ancient times, when a mighty swordsman, Memnon (Steven Brand, making his film debut) ruled over nearly all the known world. Memnon, a brutal tyrant, defeats his enemies in battle with the help of a beautiful sorceress, Cassandra (Kelly Hu), who can predict the future. The last of the \"free tribes\" form a fragile alliance to fight Memnon, and hire a trio of Akkadian assassins, led by Mathayus (pro wrestler The Rock, who made his big-screen debut as this character in The Mummy Returns), to kill the sorceress and thus remove Memnon's advantage. Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan of The Green Mile), the powerful leader of the Nubians, objects to hiring mercenaries, but the plan goes forward. The assassins are betrayed by Takmet (Peter Facinelli), the son of one of the tribal leaders, and Mathayus finds himself unable to kill Cassandra. Thanks to the unlikely machinations of Cassandra, and the aid of a horse thief, Arpid (Grant Heslov of True Lies), Mathayus escapes to the desert. He eventually abducts Cassandra, who explains that Memnon was holding her against her will. Mathayus thwarts Memnon's efforts to re-capture Cassandra, then uses his newfound sense of justice to convince the surviving tribal leaders to join forces again to defeat Memnon. The Scorpion King was directed by Chuck Russell.

A new UN report says the savings would come from reduced costs of care for mothers and newborn babies. The \"State of World Population 2012\" report was released in November.  It says over 200 million women in the developing world cannot get birth control or other family planning services. It says $4 billion a year could provide these women with reproductive information to reduce unplanned pregnancies or unsafe abortions. The report says about $2 billion a year would provide enough contraceptives to meet the needs of developing countries. The report says increased access to family planning is a good economic investment. It says having fewer children has been beneficial for rich countries in Europe and North America. The UN Population Fund says one-third of the growth of Asia's \"tiger\" economies is the result of increased use of family planning services. Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the biggest unmet needs for family planning services. The report says modern contraceptives are not widely available in countries such as Chad and Niger. But contraceptives are not enough. There are social, political and legal barriers that prevent access to birth control. In many cultures, women are encouraged to have large families and to avoid or limit the use of contraceptives.The Population Fund says family planning helps countries reduce poverty. A recent study said Nigeria's economy would grow by at least $30 billion dollars if the fertility rate fell by just one child per woman in the next 20 years.

But it didn't work. \"You can't fool people with that stuff,\" Muren says.\n\nThey then decided on the idea of using an 18-inch tall rod puppet.
