We start with our chest isolation, moving your chest around in a circle, giving the hoop a push, arms out of the way. And notice that I'm pushing with the left side of my chest and my right shoulder to get the hoop to come around. So, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest. As the hoop is coming around I'm going to notice when the hoop is in front of me. Front, front, front, front. That's when I'm going to put my arms in to start my shoulder hooping. \n\nOK. So we've got that timing first. So, front, front, front, front, front, shoulder, arms in. OK. Once we have that motion, that's how we get into it. One more time I'll show it, and then we'll focus on the actual shoulder hooping. So, front, front, front, front, front, front, arms in. OK. \n\nWhat's more difficult about shoulder hooping from chest hooping is that you're taking your body from being a round shape, like the round hoop, to a flat or oval shape. And what tends to happen is the hoop comes around and it smacks against this shoulder, and then it goes wobbly and it falls. What we have to do is smooth out the transition from the  hoop from this shoulder to this shoulder. \n\nSo what we want to do is use your left side of your chest to gently guide the hoop onto that left arm. What you're doing basically is you're going to put the hoop down, arms in at your sides, shoulders relaxed and down. Practice making big circles with your chest, really focusing on that left one, exaggerating the back right shoulder blade and the left chest in the front. \n\nSo, we'll just start on the shoulders to try and get this started. If you have trouble getting it started on your shoulders start from the chest like we did at the beginning of the video. Give the hoop a push, chest, chest, chest. Notice I'm pulling back with my right arm and pressing forward my left chest. It is also helpful if you turn slowly to the left while you do this. It will give you a little more time to recover when the hoop starts to fall. Right elbow back. Left chest forward.\n\nAnd that's how we do shoulder hooping. So, let's practice the transition from chest to shoulder. OK. We start hooping on our chest, front, front, front, front, front, arms in, chest.  That's how we do shoulder hooping.", "title": "How to Hula Hoop around Your Shoulders | Hula Hooping", "publishedDate": "2013-08-22T05:20:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "14ayCa7EI6M", "description": "Saving a Puffer Fish from a huge fishing hook...", "title": "Diver Saves Puffer Fish (Saving Puff Daddy)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T20:54:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "14b-BASNVdI", "description": "Music video by Mel & Kim performing Showing Out (Get Fresh At the Weekend).

Where my own contribution differs is that it allows for the distribution of accented pulses among regular pulses using the same algorithm. It also allows for cyclic variations of the rhythms and the distribution of accents. Each rhythm is specified by six characteristics; the number of pulses; the number of steps to divide the bar in to and distribute the pulses among; the number of accents to distribute across the pulses; the offset of pulses among the steps (i.e. the cyclic variation); the offset of the accented pulses and the output MIDI note.

Most of the songs were \nwritten by organist Robbie King (Skylark, Hometown Band, \nand, much later, Bryan Adams) and drummerDuris Maxwell \n(in Doucette with King, and later with the Powder Blues \nBand). Their blend of blues-rock, hard rock, and emerging \nprog rock often recalls Atomic Rooster & Procol Harum, \nan analogy sported as much by the style of the music as \nby King's riveting, rocking abilities at the organ. Singer \nVictor Stewart's soul sensibilities are a definite plus, \nespecially on the heartfelt \"Jonathan\" and \"You Changed My \nLife Around,\" the latter slapping a ballad-type melody \nover a rock song driven by a mean bass riff played on a \nRickenbacker. \"Automatic Man\" features odd rhythmic \npatters, a dirty organ riff, and a drum solo episode, but \nthe unsuspected highlight is \"She Went Down.\" Here, Brahman \ngets one iota shy of impersonating Gentle Giant, thanks to \nbeautiful contrapuntal lines, a harpsichord, shifting time \nsignatures, and Stewart's voice finding a fragility very \nclose to Kerry Minnear's. The naivete found in some of \nthe lyrics (\"Build a Tower,\" \"Jonathan\") did not age well \nbut, otherwise, this long-unavailable LP is worth seeking \nout. ~ Fran\u00e7ois Couture, \n\nhttp://ezhevika.blogspot.com.es/2006/06/brahman-brahman-1971.html\n\nMusicians\nRobbie King (keyboards)\nD.

Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. Fertilization is the fusion of both sex cell or gamete.Copulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.\nFor animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.", "title": "Cows mating documentary behavior", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T06:59:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "150ivpcafpM", "description": "", "title": "Exclusive Boat Haulage Video", "publishedDate": "2013-07-28T20:39:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "150vJ6FGkF4", "description": "The ReGen line of products combine amino acids, vegetable extracts, vitamins, polypeptide's and proteins to help reduce excessive, unnatural hair loss.

Refusant de vendre ses principes et de retirer son  soutien au peuple sahraoui  qui milite pour son ind\u00e9pendance, l'Alg\u00e9rie s'est retrouv\u00e9e ainsi  impliqu\u00e9e dans une guerre  sans merci : \u00ab la guerre d'Amgala \u00bb. C'est la sagesse des dirigeants alg\u00e9riens, qui ont tout fait pour arr\u00eater  cette h\u00e9morragie de sang que le pire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9,  qui a failli faire entrer les deux peuples voisins dans une guerre sans fin o\u00f9 la facture des morts aurait pu \u00eatre lourde pour les deux pays.  Malgr\u00e9 ce corps \u00e0 corps entre les deux pays, l'Alg\u00e9rie a jou\u00e9 grand, elle a su d\u00e9velopper  une diplomatie sage et prudente, favorisant ainsi  la voie de la paix sur la voie des canons de chars. En 1991, le Maroc et le Polisario signent un accord de cessez-le-feu, pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'autod\u00e9termination. Malheureusement, ce r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum n'a toujours pas eu lieu et le Maroc contr\u00f4le  toujours 80 % du territoire du Sahara occidental .Ce conflit avait caus\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui  la mort de plus de 16 000 personnes. Une guerre de propagande et de tension diplomatique contre l'Alg\u00e9rie et une guerre terroriste et injuste contre le peuple sahraoui, c'est le nom de la guerre que le pouvoir marocain se livre depuis pr\u00e8s de 30 ans.   En ce d\u00e9but  d'ann\u00e9e 2014, le Maroc s'abstient  toujours \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ses excuses \u00e0 l'Alg\u00e9rie suite \u00e0 la violation, en novembre dernier, du si\u00e8ge de son consulat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 Casablanca et de la profanation de l'embl\u00e8me national. Cet acte ne peut que confirmer la honte d'un comportement de haine et  de m\u00e9prise de la part des gouvernants marocains contre l'Alg\u00e9rie et ses institutions. Devant cette nouvelle agression, l'Alg\u00e9rie a ripost\u00e9 par la bouche de son ministre des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res, qui  a tenu \u00e0 adresser aux responsables marocains un message de v\u0153ux  de bonne ann\u00e9e assez in\u00e9dit et assez clair. Ramtane Lamamra, \u00ab il faut pour l'instant oublier la r\u00e9ouverture des fronti\u00e8res terrestres et la question du Sahara restera un probl\u00e8me de d\u00e9colonisation aux yeux du voisin de l'est \u00bb. Donc, la r\u00e9ouverture des fronti\u00e8res alg\u00e9ro-marocaines, ne sera pas pour demain et l'Alg\u00e9rie ne c\u00e9dera pas au chantage du Maroc  en ce qui concerne la question du Sahara, pour Alger le Maroc est le dernier colon  du 21 si\u00e8cle aux yeux du monde. En donneur de le\u00e7on au monarque ch\u00e9rifien, le chef de la diplomatie alg\u00e9rienne, Ramtane Lamamra a estim\u00e9 que \u00ab les fr\u00e8res marocains savent parfaitement ce qu'ils pourraient et devraient faire pour que les relations bilat\u00e9rales connaissent un cours normal \u00bb.  L'ampleur du dommage caus\u00e9 aux relations entre le Maroc et l'Alg\u00e9rie  par l'agression perp\u00e9tr\u00e9e contre le consulat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'Alg\u00e9rie \u00e0 Casablanca et par la profanation de l'embl\u00e8me national, ne sera sans doute pas oubli\u00e9e.

Learn the rules of etiquette in time for your next business meeting.\n\n\nStep 1: Be prepared\nBe prepared, with pen and paper and any pertinent information that will help contribute to the meeting. Practice attention to detail for meetings so that you don't have to leave the room for something you forgot.\n\nTip\nBusiness meetings are for sharing information, not socializing -- act professional.\n\nStep 2: Show up early\nGet there at least 5 minutes early, and wear your game face. Punctuality conveys appropriate focus and respect.\n\nStep 3: Ditch electronic distractions\nOnce the meeting begins, leave the PDA and phone in your pocket to eliminate the slightest chance of diversion or interruption.\n\nStep 4: Raise your hand to speak\nIf you're not running or presenting at the meeting, hold your peace until the meeting breaks up or wait until the principal invites comments. Don't interrupt others and raise your hand if you have questions, which should be pithy and relevant to everyone in attendance.\n\nStep 5: Pay attention\nShow manners and pay attention. Don't drum, tap, fidget, flip through the reading material, or cast looks around.\n\nStep 6: Avoid binging\nGo easy on alcohol and food at catered meetings and conferences. You are there to do business, not fill up as if it were a party -- keep your eye on the ball.\n\nStep 7: Complete tasks afterward\nMaintain etiquette even after the meeting by completing tasks, assigned as goals during the discussion, as quickly as possible. File meeting notes afterward to keep track of and report on later.\n\nDid You Know?\nThe first business cards, called \"visiting cards,\" announced the arrival of aristocracy.

If you touch an airstone after it spends a week or two in a tank, that slime you see is bacteria and fungal colonies. Pythium is airborn along with plenty of other nasty things.  A small pond pump does a much better job at stirring and keeping the solution oxygenated.  If ever you have a little spare cash at hand, order a dissolved oxygen meter and you will also witness the oxygen levels being the same with both the pump and the airstone. Another argument in favor of a pond pump is zero maintenance and no noise.\n\nOf course, in deepwater culture systems where roots are suspended in water, air stones will be needed only if growing oxygen loving fast growing annual plants.  While if you were growing lettuce in such systems, water movement would be enough.  These systems work fine for a few months then become so contaminated that pythium becomes a huge problem... always. Sterilizing these systems is very important! This is easy for the hobbyist that has a few buckets, but commercial scale growers will never, ever be able to keep everything clean enough and are bound to encounter some serious bacterial problems. Hopefully this helps you in preventing root rot!\n\nhttp://www.steveshydroponics.ca\nhttp://youtu.be/15DxT23T5GU", "title": "Preventing Root Rot | Hydroponics Halifax", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T17:16:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "15EL7OC2Oag", "description": "What is Xerochrysum bracteatum?\nA report all about Xerochrysum bracteatum for homework/assignment\n\nXerochrysum bracteatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting or strawflower, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Australia. Described by \u00c3\u2030tienne Pierre Ventenat in 1803, it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years before being transferred to a new genus Xerochrysum in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre (3 ft) tall with green or grey leafy foliage. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery bracts that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of habitats across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans (butterflies and moths), and adult butterflies, hoverflies, native bees, small beetles and grasshoppers visit the flower heads.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerochrysum_bracteatum\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Xerochrysum bracteatum", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T10:48:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "15EOs39df0Y", "description": "Nice one from Devnik and Lowan.\n\nCheck out Devnik's soundcloud:\nhttp://soundcloud.com/devnik\n\nThis channel is for entertainment purpuses only.\nDon't forget to subscribe for more dubstep and dnb!\nVisit our facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/DnBlazeProduction/148814628520940", "title": "Devnik & Lowan - Outsiders [HD]", "publishedDate": "2011-06-12T18:51:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "15ETUDFUhfQ", "description": "", "title": "Side Effects Of High Potassium Level", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T17:10:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "15EWPPdbelk", "description": "Finally i have found a solution to Origin being a pain in the A$$ when you try to login!\n\nOrigin Download: https://www.origin.com/en-gb/download\n\nLeave A like please i need these likes and subscribers!

Lastly, clean up any remaining wax with the scraper and paper towels and place them into the trash bag.  The sewer flange should be clean of any wax and debris.\n\nOnce the sewer flange is clean, inspect the flange to ensure that it is not damaged in any way.  If the sewer flange or sub-flooring is damaged, they will need to be repaired accordingly.  \n\nWax Ring Replacement\n\nIf the sewer flange is in good condition then the new wax ring can be installed.  To install the new wax ring first remove the soft wax ring from its tray by griping the center plastic hole carefully, and pulling off the plastic tray.  Next, place the wax ring onto the sewer flange with the narrow end of the plastic lip inserted into the flange.  Center and adjust the ring as needed.  Now slide the plastic holding washers down the mounting bolts and set the new bolts into the mounting channels along the edge of the toilet flange and slide them into place.\n\nToilet Replacement\n\nOnce the wax ring and mounting bolts are all in place then the area is ready to have the toilet remounted.  Lay a straight edge on the floor next to the mounting bolts to help mark the bolts position.  Begin by placing the base of the toilet over the sewer flange with the mounting bolts passing through the openings at the base.  Once the base is in the correct position push down on the toilet compressing the wax ring around the toilet's drainpipe.\n\nNow that the toilet base is mounted, take the plastic cap rings and slide them down the mounting bolts, followed by the corresponding metal washers and nuts.  Tighten both mounting nuts by hand until they are firmly in place.  When both bolts are hand tightened, take a socket wrench and finish tightening the bolts so the toilet does not move at all.  Keep in mind the toilet's base can only withstand a few pounds of torque.\nWith the toilet securely mounted to the flooring the bolts can be trimmed to a quarter-inch past the nut.  Using a mini-hacksaw carefully cut off the remainder of the mounting bolts so the entire bolt can be hidden under the plastic cap.  Once both bolts are cut, snap the plastic cap cover over the bolts for a clean safe appearance.\n\nAfter the caps are fastened, connect the water supply valve's tanks hose to the shank of the fill assembly.  Turn on the water supply valve and fill the tank of the toilet, looking for any possible leaks.  Make adjustments to the water level and any internal parts if necessary.  When all adjustments are complete, cycle the toilet and look for any leaks.  Once all inspections are done replace the tank lid and the job is complete.", "title": "Toilet Flange Wax Ring Replacement Part 2 of 2", "publishedDate": "2010-02-19T23:51:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "15PrxcDLzYY", "description": "Baile na Serra cantado por \"Os Serranos\".

A gun? A taser? For countless women, it is pepper spray or OC spray (Oleoresin Capsicum spray).\n\nMany women carry the non-lethal deterrent on a key chain or buried in their purse. Law enforcement experts say it can't help you in an emergency unless you have it ready to go in your hand.  \n\n\"You need to make sure that you're pointing it in the right direction. A lot of times, in a stressful situation, users pull it out and turn it towards themselves,\" explains Captain Freddie Wood. \n\nWood is an OC spray and defensive tactics in instructor at the Chesapeake Sheriff's Office Training Academy.  New deputies are trained to use pepper spray so they can be effective on the job. Training involves getting sprayed in the face, then fighting through the burn to perform a series of defensive tactics and finally subdue a would-be suspect.\n\nCaptain Wood says if these new deputies can fight through the effects of pepper spray, so can a bad guy. That's why it's important to use the spray properly. \n\n\"OC is the perfect weapon for the private citizen, but what they have to understand is, you don't just stand there and admire your work.  Once you spray your attacker -- make space. Put as much space between you and the subject as you can,\" stresses Captain Wood.\n\nThe captain has some simple, straight forward advice on the 'best use' practices for pepper spray use by civilians:\n\n1-Be sure you are aiming the pepper spray canister in the right direction, not toward yourself\n2-Make sure the pepper spray is handy, not buried in your purse\n3-Ensure you are downwind of the spray and not spraying 'against the wind' to avoid spray-back.\n4-Hold the pepper spray properly, with your index finger on the trigger -- NOT your thumb -- that way you have a good grip and cannot be disarmed\n5-When you spray pepper spray -- do it in a pattern -- from ear-to-ear and eyebrows down.\n6-After you spray, don't stick around to see what happens. Get away as fast as you can.\n\nCaptain Woods says using pepper spray properly can make the difference between getting hurt and getting away.", "title": "Pepper Spray Like A Pro", "publishedDate": "2013-12-01T10:43:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "15S0g8pG6HU", "description": "From the makers of Rapist Glasses...\nIntroducing:  \"Pedophile Beards\"\nwww.jonlajoie.com", "title": "Pedophile Beards", "publishedDate": "2008-03-29T04:29:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "15SFydaoM_M", "description": "Three acts, One Journey, 412 Bones.", "title": "Odyssey Theater Presents: Jack Nicholson: Tibia", "publishedDate": "2014-09-25T17:40:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "15SknR-YDr8", "description": "Video by Erik Pearson.

Legendary Power.\n\nPrimed by up to six 12AX7 preamp tubes and driven by four 6L6GC power tubes, the 6505 guitar amplifier delivers the tone and high gain power that modern players demand. Plugging into the high gain input doubles the input gain for devastating overdriven tones. On top of that, you can create a second \"lead\" tone by engaging the Crunch option on the rhythm channel. In the master section you will find the patented Resonance and Presence controls. Resonance acts as a low-frequency boost, while Presence acts as a high-frequency boost, both allowing you to sculpt your tone.

Now, if you remember what a flam is, a flam is your strong hand starting up in the air and your weaker hand starting closer to the drum, and then this one will follow by a tap. So, you're going to do an accent and a flam on the first note, a tap on your strong hand, and a final tap on your alternating hand. Now, this rudiment itself, though it alternates sticking, doesn't necessarily alternate lead sides, so you'll have to go back and practice the other side. \n\nSo a single Swiss Army Triplet on the right side will look like this. When you speed it up into rhythm it sounds like this. \n\nSwiss Army Triplets work really well around the drums with fills and grooves. I'm just going to give you an example of a groove mixed with a fill, not changing my sticking, using that Swiss Army. And I will start slow, and then eventually work it up in speed. Sounds like this.\n\nThat's one of those examples that a rudiment can be really interesting around the different surfaces of the drums.

As a clinical nurse specialist in the neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and pain and palliative care units at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, he strives to impart his commitment to other nurses.\n\n{partial transcript}\n\nMy name is Wayne Quashie and I\u2019m a clinical nurse specialist on the neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and pain and palliative care floor and my role really is on the educator and chemical resource for all the staff on the unit with the main diagnosis of cancer you've already experienced the loss, a loss of health and sometimes a loss of dreams.  We deal with the person from that initial loss of that cancer diagnosis and then work with them through the trajectory of the disease and sometimes you may have to get to that point where it's the last moments of life.\n\nI\u2019m Dee, I\u2019m another nurse on the floor.  I\u2019ve worked on the oncology floor for three years now.  Wayne reminds you that you're here for patient care. You know we never lose focus of that here. I always say to myself if it was me or my family member I would want them to be taken care of like this. The thing that most of the nurses learn very quickly is the technical part the technical skills, that's pretty straightforward.  You learn how to hang blood you learn how to give meds, you learn all that stuff, that\u2019s very easy. Now the real work begins they still have to learn from the get go how do you work with family members that are undergoing illness, because the families undergoing the illness. We\u2019re not only treating the patients we\u2019re treating the family too.  For us to really do what we do we have to really be compassionate and be able to connect when I going to patients rooms and I can see the pictures on the wall.  To us Mr Smith is this patient. But to the family members Mr Smith is that person on the wall that's drinking a Pina Colada on vacation.  In the face of illness, there\u2019s no way but to really connect with them and really share in their joys and share in their sorrows.", "title": "Wayne Quashie Discusses Patient Centered Care | Memorial Sloan Kettering", "publishedDate": "2010-09-15T16:40:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "16Ayp_cZ4FA", "description": "Hosts File To Download: http://www.mediafire.com/?81pxoqmmj2ip71p\n\nFile Directory: C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\n\nMAKE A BACK UP OF THE OLD FILE.

Ada figure raksasa yang tingginya hampir mencapai langit -- langit ruangan, ada suara serdadu Londo berbaris lengkap denngan aba -- aba komando berbahasa Belanda, aneka teriakan tidak jelas, ringkikan suara kuda, dan masih banyak lainnya. Pengalaman diganggu oleh hantu di Museum Wayang juga pernah dialami oleh Rasmin (50). Dia bekerja sudah lebih dari lima tahun menjaga museum tersebut. namun, berdasarkan pengakuan kawan -- kawannya yang juga bekerja di museum, terkadang Rasmin selalu sengaja memanggil hantu yang ada di museum.

Kemarin saja dia dilihatin sama wanita baju merah di depan soalnya dia manggil setan itu,\" kata Yusuf yang merupakan rekan Rasmin.\n \nMenurut Yusuf, terkadang kawannya itu juga sering dirasuki oleh hantu yang ada di museum. Karena itu kawan -- kawannya tidak ada yang berani mendekatinya.\n\"Waktu itu dia lagi manggil -- manggil hantu, nah mungkin karena tidak kuat dia akhirnya dirasukin. Sebenarnya kami takut tapi karena kami kasihan melihat dia yang tubuhnya dipergunakan oleh setan akhirnya kami membantu dia,\" kata Yusuf.\n Yusuf sendiri baru enam bulan bekerja di museum wayang. Dia mengaku belum pernah melihat hantu atau diganggu oleh hantu yang ada di museum. Namun dia sering mendengar cerita -- cerita dari teman -- temannya yang sudah bekerja lebih dulu di museum tersebut.\nSementara itu, menurut karyawan lainnya, Hasan (48), dia pernah mengalami kejadian mistis di museum tersebut. Dia bercerita pernah ditemui oleh sosok wanita dengan wajah yang sudah rusak tepat di depan musholah yang letaknya di depan tangga menuju lantai dua. \"Waktu itu lagi pengen sholat. Saya bingung pas saya melihat ada wanita di depan pintu masuk ke musholah.

He would also receive one penny (83p today), for every record sold. Moreover, the company would produce for him every quarter a statement of records sold and the amount due to him.\nA copy of the contract is shown briefly at the beginning of the video.\nThe company stated they would do everything they could do to promote his records. Their trademark crown logo was changed to a photograph of JP and copy signature.\nIt was mentioned in the press at the time that Jack Payne had not just been elevated to the peerage but replaced the Crown itself.\nA special 3.5 inch record was given away to promote these new records. Flyers were produced, large advertisments in the perodicals of the day. Record dealers sent advice of how to promote displays of his records.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "Shocking  Car Crashes Woman Overpassing the road", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T22:30:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "16JZy9EdZqg", "description": "Different Kinds of Stress\nPart 1 - Acute vs. Chronic Stress\n\nAcute stress is when a single stressful event occurs.

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.\n\nDota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the \"Ancient\", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.\n\nDevelopment of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded its rewarding gameplay, enhanced production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players\n\nGAMEPLAY : \nDota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. The player may command a single controllable character called a \"Hero\", which is chosen from a selection pool of 108. Each Hero begins the match at level one but may become more powerful by accumulating experience through combat, thereby leveling up. With every level gained\u2014the maximum is twenty-five\u2014the player may either select a new ability for their Hero to learn or enhance their general statistics. The Hero's methods of combat are influenced by their primary property \u2013 Strength, Agility, or Intelligence.\n\nDota 2 features a host of items, which the player may store in a small inventory. Said items may be acquired predominantly through purchase by gold, the in-game currency. Items vary in function: some enhance the statistics of a Hero, while others grant additional abilities. The player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously, though they can obtain more by destroying enemies. Killing non-player characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow, whereas killing enemy Heroes grants gold to the player's nearby allies as well. Destroying Towers or killing Roshan gives gold to all players on the team. \"Denying\" is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemy's ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so. \"Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (Video Game)\" \"Warcraft III: Reign Of Chaos (Video Game)\" 24hours stream here bro : twitch.tv/onlybrothers come on brother!", "title": "Dota 2 - #Chateados #80", "publishedDate": "2014-09-08T20:44:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "16LI9tI6hP8", "description": "comments : http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=GNcg15sEIhA\n\ni bet he'll chicken out. all mouth, broken, mickeymouth.", "title": "Mickey Challenge", "publishedDate": "2012-11-13T18:50:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "16LKfn7scws", "description": "LIAM GALLAGHER PERFORMING THE WHO'S MY GENERATION AT AN EVENING OF THE WHO MUSIC FOR THE TEENAGE CANCER TRUST AT THE SHEPHERDS BUSH EMPIRE LONDON.", "title": "LIAM GALLAGHER + THE WHO, MY GENERATION @ SHEPHERDS BUSH EMPIRE 11 NOVEMBER 2014 HD", "publishedDate": "2014-11-12T01:04:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "16LLZwh0y6U", "description": "SDM - \u00dcBERALL ERH\u00c4LTLICH!!!\n\nITUNES\nhttp://itunes.com/kurdo\n\nBOX (2CD, Shirt, Bandana, Poster, Autogrammkarte, Sticker)\nhttp://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00GHIT9LU\n \nPREMIUM VERSION - 2CD - 20 TRACKS:\nhttp://www.amazon.de/Slum-Dog-Millionaer-Premium-Kurdo/dp/B00GJ5P3S4\n\nSTANDARD VERSION - 1 CD - 15 TRACKS:\nhttp://www.amazon.de/Slum-Dog-Millionaer-Kurdo/dp/B00GJ5P172\n\nKURDO:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Kurdomuzik\nhttps://twitter.com/Kurdo_11\n\nKURDO MERCH\nhttp://burner.de/kurdo\n\nKURDO OUTFIT\nhttp://burner.de\n\nBEEFHAUS:\nhttp://facebook.com/beefhaus\n\nBeat von Sonus\nhttp://facebook.com/sonus030\n\nVideo von Stevo Balboa\nhttp://facebook.com/balboastevo\n\nShirt von:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bmlifestyle", "title": "Kurdo - Intro // Slum Dog Millionaer", "publishedDate": "2013-11-10T16:59:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "16LMH4bImFI", "description": "Afther the rain\n\nBy Ngoisheewai", "title": "Ciblek Sawah/Prenjak Sawah-Yellow Bellied Prinia", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T03:56:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "16LQjVXLooY", "description": "Crash on Westbank corner of Kyalami race track", "title": "Kyalami_WestBank.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-01-24T09:52:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "16M88xowufk", "description": "Yashua and Yahshua are shortened forms of his name Yahushua\nYahusha is a Masorete Deception see for yourself http://downloads.thewaytoyahuweh.com/pdf.php#dead_sea_scrolls\nthey took out the second \u05d5 in \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2", "title": "The Masoretes Changed Yahushua the Messiah's True Name!!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-03T14:22:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "16MAkvH1I98", "description": "", "title": "ness souk ahras (GRoPE Est-Dz)", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T14:22:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "16MODw5clts", "description": "Find out all about the Crescent City at http://www.notesonneworleans.net Spike TV's Bar Rescue with Jon Taffer. \n\nSpike TV recently came to my neighborhood and re-invented a bar two blocks from my house. What luck. I had been invited by the production company to come and observe the before and after. It seemed I was the only \"press\" there. They treated me very well. Really nice people working on the show. Quite an amazing transformation. \n\nAs you'll see in the video the old bar was kind of scuzzy looking with an old pool table and dark panelling and really just not a lot of class. A place where college students might hang out and get drunk. It would not be a place where I'd take a date or a spouse. In fact, although it's been in my neighborhood for ages I've only been in it once having no desire to go back.\n\nAfter the conversion though, although not really that dramatic at first glance, the place looks cleaner and sharper, the dull paneling is now painted white, the bar looks brighter, a wall has been put up in front of the bathrooms affording more privacy, the kitchen window has been made smaller so you don't have to see the kitchen and all the falderal that goes on back there. \n\nOne of the best transitions are the tall tables with candles on them. This makes each space more intimate and would definitely be a place to take a woman.\n\nIn short it's been made more upscale but not too classy as to not make it appealing to college students who just want to go out to a place without having to dress up. Pretty smart mix of style and relaxation. \n\nThe place looks a lot better from the outside to. Through the windows it looks bright and clean and the candles really make it an inviting atmosphere.

We offer NC (numerically controlled) and CNC (computer numerically controlled) machines to choose from depending on the application at hand.\n\nThe NC mandrel benders use a numerical controller that stores the called upon program and controls the bender functions and bend angles for that specific program. With NC machines there is some operator input required, like moving the tubing to the next bend location and rotating the bend to the next plane of bend angle required. It is however, extremely accurate to .1 degree and being NC costs less upfront money than CNC. An NC mandrel exhaust bender is perfect for producing turbo, air intakes, headers, exhaust and chassis for race cars, marine, or for out fitting semi trucks.\n\nThe CNC mandrel bender line uses a computer controller coupled to hydraulics and servo motors that controls the entire bend process once the tube is put on the machine. We offer mandrel benders with multiple axis and roll bending features for larger sweeping bends that would be apparent in furniture. We offer a CNC mandrel tube bender for most applications up to 8-1/2 OD. Our tube bending equipment can bend as tight as \u00bd the diameter for certain applications. These machines are perfect for large bend houses, hydraulic suppliers, automotive, furniture manufacturers, and much more.\n\nPlease enter the mandrel bender type you require to find out which machine fits your requirements.

The Animals had their origins in a Newcastle-based group called the Kansas City Five, whose membership included pianist Alan Price, drummer John Steel, and vocalist Eric Burdon. Price exited to join the Kontours in 1962, while Burdon went off to London. The Kontours, whose membership included Bryan \"Chas\" Chandler, eventually were transmuted into the Alan Price R&B Combo, with John Steel joining on drums. Burdon's return to Newcastle in early 1963 heralded his return to the lineup. The final member of the combo, guitarist Hilton Valentine, joined just in time for the recording of a self-produced EP under the band's new name, the Animals. That record alerted Graham Bond to the Animals; he was likely responsible for pointing impresario Giorgio Gomelsky to the group.\n\nGomelsky booked the band into his Crawdaddy Club in London, and they were subsequently signed by Mickie Most, an independent producer who secured a contract with EMI's Columbia imprint. A studio session in February 1964 yielded their Columbia debut single, \"Baby Let Me Take You Home\" (adapted from \"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\"), which rose to number 21 on the British charts. For years, it was rumored incorrectly that the Animals got their next single, \"House of the Rising Sun,\" from Bob Dylan's first album, but it has been revealed that, like \"Baby Let Me Take You Home,\" the song came to them courtesy of Josh White. In any event, the song -- given a new guitar riff by Valentine and a soulful organ accompaniment devised by Price -- shot to the top of the U.K. and U.S. charts early that summer. This success led to a follow-up session that summer, yielding their first long-playing record, The Animals. Their third single, \"I'm Crying,\" rose to number eight on the British charts. The group compiled an enviable record of Top Ten successes, including \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" and \"We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" along with a second album, Animal Tracks.\n\nIn May of 1965, immediately after recording \"We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" Alan Price left the band, citing fear of flying as the reason; subsequent biographies of the band have indicated that the reasons were less psychological. When \"House of the Rising Sun\" was recorded, using what was essentially a group arrangement, the management persuaded the band to put one person's name down as arranger. Price came up the lucky one, supposedly with the intention that the money from the arranger credit would be divided later on. The money was never divided, however, and as soon as it began rolling in, Price suddenly developed his fear of flying and exited the band. Others cite the increasing contentiousness between Burdon and Price over leadership of the group as the latter's reason for leaving. In any case, a replacement was recruited in the person of Dave Rowberry.\n\nIn the meantime, the group was growing increasingly unhappy with the material they were being given to record by manager Mickie Most. Not only were the majority of these songs much too commercial for their taste, but they represented a false image of the band, even if many were successful. \"It's My Life,\" a number seven British hit and a similar smash in America, caused the Animals to terminate their association with Most and with EMI Records. They moved over to Decca/London Records and came up with a more forceful, powerful sound on their first album for the new label, Animalisms. The lineup shifts continued, however: Steel exited in 1966, after recording Animalisms, and was replaced by Barry Jenkins, formerly of the Nashville Teens. Chandler left in mid-1966 after recording \"Don't Bring Me Down\" and Valentine remained until the end of 1966, but essentially \"Don't Bring Me Down\" marked the end of the original Animals.  ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Clark a esta conclusi\u00f3n? Mediante el uso de un instrumento de su invenci\u00f3n, el sincr\u00f3metro, el que utilizando una muestra de un par\u00e1sito permite establecer su presencia en una substancia o en un individuo con una precisi\u00f3n mayor al 95 %. Mejorando cuando se repite la medici\u00f3n.\nEsta tecnolog\u00eda le permiti\u00f3 a la Dra. Clark establecer que tipo de par\u00e1sito actuaba en cada enfermedad y cual era el o los contaminantes asociados.\nLas conclusiones fueron realmente sorprendentes.\nUn primer ejemplo: en los problemas de pr\u00f3stata act\u00faan bacterias que se alimentan con Niquel, el cual est\u00e1 presente en las amalgamas met\u00e1licas dentarias (no as\u00ed en las pl\u00e1sticas).\nOtro ejemplo: muchos detergentes y jabones que ella investig\u00f3 normalmente en venta en los EE.UU. est\u00e1n contaminados con un aceite denominado PCB (polychlorinated byphenyls), aluminio, cobalto y otras substancias qu\u00edmicas.\nEllas se adhieren luego a la piel al usar la ropa o son accidentalmente ingeridas.\nPor lo tanto, ella aconseja utilizar Borax, en determinadas proporciones para el uso dom\u00e9stico.\n\nMedicina Alternativa colombia / Medicina Alternativa en Cali\n\nUn tercer ejemplo: Muchas pastas para dientes, que investig\u00f3, inclusive las que ofrece Health Food Stores, pueden contener metales pesados como el esta\u00f1o, estroncio, fluoruro.Tambi\u00e9n Circonio y Benzanonio. Todos ellos muy negativos que deben ser sustitu\u00eddos con t\u00e9cnicas de limpieza diferentes.\n\nEjemplo Final: (el mas importante) La Dra Clark encontr\u00f3 que el c\u00e1ncer es el resultado de la acci\u00f3n de un par\u00e1sito, el Fasciolopsis Buskii, que eventualmente vive \"tranquilamente\" en el intestino en su faz adulta produciendo huevos que normalmente se excretan , hasta que ciertos factores permiten que estos se desarrollen en nuestro cuerpo. Estos factores s\u00f3lo pueden ponerse en acci\u00f3n cuando est\u00e1 presente un solvente espec\u00edfico el Alcohol isoprop\u00edlico.\n\nPodemos decir que la Dra. Clark, no s\u00f3lo hizo una investigaci\u00f3n te\u00f3rica: busc\u00f3 soluciones concretas para hacer frente a los diferentes problemas y verific\u00f3 la eficacia de ellas a numerosos pacientes.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los principios generales de esas soluciones?\n\nEn primer lugar, es preciso determinar el ingreso de los contaminantes, tomando conciencia de su origen.\n\nEn segundo lugar, es necesario atacar con distintas armas la existencia y la acci\u00f3n de los par\u00e1sitos. Para ello, la Dra. Clark invent\u00f3 un instrumento principal que bautiz\u00f3 ZAPPER. Su aspecto es el de una peque\u00f1a caja electr\u00f3nica (parecida a un control remoto de TV), con dos cables cuyos polos terminales se apoyan sobre nuestro cuerpo ( es decir, no es invasivo).\nUna imperceptible corriente alterna, alimentada con una bater\u00eda de 9 voltios circula por nuestro organismo de un polo a otro durante 7 minutos, luego entre 20 y 40 minutos de descanso y el ciclo se repite: En resumen tres aplicaciones de 7 minutos con dos descansos entre 20 y 40 minutos. Algo mas de una hora en total.\n\nEl Zapper destruye los par\u00e1sitos. No se ha observado efecto secundario alguno. El usos peri\u00f3dico depende del caso a tratar lo cual se detalla en sus libros. Los estudios de la Dra. Clark confirman un \u00e9xito completo en la cura de muchas enfermedades.\n\nAtenci\u00f3n: el Zapper no reemplaza la asistencia de un profesional de la salud.\nA este tratamiento la Dra. Clark le agrega el uso de ciertas hiervas naturales, vitaminas y minerales imprescindibles para \"limpiar\", \u00f3rganos vitales como los intestinos, h\u00edgado y ri\u00f1ones.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL4tHCWeyh8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufZjgRM-PB4\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Tk-_Dgb5Q\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWTakqt6SM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0yb4cW-Sso", "title": "Medicina Alternativa colombia / Medicina Alternativa en Cali", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T19:21:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "16dIyrGEi48", "description": "", "title": "ahsan haris fi l3alam", "publishedDate": "2013-10-19T19:36:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "16dWIpAr7R0", "description": "on January 2, 2006 13 men were trapped in the Sago mines in West Virginia, only one made it out alive.\na vid i did for my west Virginia history class", "title": "sago mine disaster", "publishedDate": "2009-08-31T13:46:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "16d_kILhw6Y", "description": "Sweet Leaf Reggae - Straight and Narrow\nhttps://www.facebook.com/slowridemusic?fref=nf", "title": "Sweet Leaf Reggae - Straight and Narrow", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T18:31:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "16eMVIbex94", "description": "Title: Elements of Kindness\nSchool: Anderson Primary\nParticipant Names: Debby Cheok Jia Qiao, Loh Jia Yi Joey, Ng Xin Yi Jolene, Nurandiani Sufi Bte Subhan\n\nE is for Excellent \nL is for Learning \nE is for Easiness\nM is Melody\nE is for Elegance \nN is for Nice \nT is for Treat \nS is for Sincerely \n\nO is for One\nF is Friendly\n\nK is for Kind\nI is for Integrity\nN is for Nation\nD is for Determine \nN is for nifty\nE is for Endearment \nS is for Social \nS is for Special \n\nAnd this spells \"Elements of Kindness\"", "title": "Melody of Hope 2014: Elements of Kindness", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T02:03:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "16eRMMtZ7r8", "description": "", "title": "trike", "publishedDate": "2011-01-01T09:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "16egWpgQdJg", "description": "This is how I seal a tubeless tire that lost the seal.

It is one of the most outstanding examples of Greater Greece art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy. The area was included in the UNESCO Heritage Site list in 1997. Much of the excavation and restoration of the temples was due to the efforts of archaeologist Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta (1783--1863), who was the Duke of Serradifalco from 1809 through 1812.\nThe term \"valley\" is a misnomer, the site being located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.\nThe Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in Doric style. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the Olympeion, are a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:\nTemple of Juno, built in the 5th century BC and burnt in 406 BC by the Carthaginians. It was usually used for the celebration of weddings.\nTemple of Concordia, whose name comes from a Latin inscription found nearby, and which was also built in the 5th century BC. Turned into a church in the 6th century AD, it is now one of the best preserved in the Valley.\nTemple of Heracles, who was one of the most venerated deities in the ancient Akragas. It is the most ancient in the Valley: destroyed by an earthquake, it consists today of only eight columns.\nTemple of Zeus Olympic, built in 480 BC to celebrate the city-state's victory over Carthage. It is characterized by the use of large scale atlases.\nTemple of Castor and Pollux.

The person can suffer form mental problems and learning difficulties. \n\nThat said, PKU can be diagnosed early with a simple blood test at birth.

We offer many different skin care treatments here at Vanish. Everything from your basic facials to more advanced facials for acne-prone skin or aging skin and hyper-pigmented skin. We also offer microdermabrasion as well as chemical peels. Let's talk about microdermabrasion. You may be familiar with the crystal form of microdermabrasion, instead here at Vanish we like to offer the diamond form of microdermabrasion. \nA diamond micro utilizes diamond tips which can come in various shapes, sizes and levels of aggressiveness or abrasiveness. This allows me to better customize the treatment to the patient's actual needs. It also allows me to get in the delicate eye area whereas you can't do that with crystals. The diamond microdermabrasion exfoliates the top layer of dead skin cells and all the environmental debris, the dust, the dirt, the pollen. All of the factors that clog the pores, cause the ashiness and dullness to the surface of the skin. \nWith just one treatment you are going to notice a brighter, smoother complexion. You are going to notice that your products sink in more quickly and deeply and you get more benefits from them. A series of microdermabrasions can help eliminate fine lines and wrinkles and hyper-pigmentation or sun damage. Give us a call at Vanish today and we'll set up a free skin care consultation with you so we can decide what the best skin care treatment and the best course of action would be to help you get your skin performing at its optimal level and looking beautiful.\n\nVanish, Inc.\n6818 N Oracle.  #414\nTucson, AZ 85704\n\n520-812-7635", "title": "Tucson Dermabrasion", "publishedDate": "2012-11-04T01:40:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "16tKbKG-s3o", "description": "", "title": "Feeding Asian Arowana,  Dragon Fish (Scleropages formosus) in Medan, Indonesia", "publishedDate": "2014-01-06T18:26:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "16tVm6kZ22w", "description": "", "title": "el ciclo de una endospora", "publishedDate": "2013-02-10T08:10:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "16tVtORKGOs", "description": "Compare, Comprove, e Compre j\u00e1 a sua Oral-B Complete: http://www.oralb.com.br/\n \nAs boquinhas de Michel Tel\u00f3 e Rodrigo Faro foram para uma balada testar o poder do novo Oral-B Complete A\u00e7\u00e3o Duradoura, que dura 5 vezes mais.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "Upon Julia's Clothes by Robert Herrick", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:57:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "16yC7g_nhrE", "description": "Singing Praise is What I do in Queens, NY", "title": "Bettina Pennon Praise is What I do", "publishedDate": "2009-06-14T02:42:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "16yiV10M1hA", "description": "Optical scanning is a process to restore historic sound recordings, non-invasively.

Die Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zu dieser Pflanzengruppe ist nicht sofort ersichtlich, auf den ersten Blick erinnert diese Pflanze mit den distelartigen, stacheligen Bl\u00e4ttern und H\u00fcllbl\u00e4ttern eher an einen Korbbl\u00fctler. Der Feldmannstreu ist eine w\u00e4rmeliebende Pflanze die viel kr\u00e4ftige Sonneneinstrahlung vertr\u00e4gt. So findet man diese Heilkr\u00e4uter trockenen Wildwiesen, an sonnenbeschienen Wegr\u00e4ndern und auf D\u00e4mmen. Im Sp\u00e4tsommer beginnen sich die fruchtenden St\u00e4ngel  von der Wurzel abzul\u00f6sen; sie werden dann vom Wind weitergetragen um neue Standorte zu erobern. Pflanzen, die auf diese Art ihre Samen verbreiten, nennt man Laufdisteln oder Steppenhexen.\n\nDer Feldmannstreu  wurde bereits im Altertum gegen einige Leiden eingesetzt. Im besonderen wurde die appetitanregende und harntreibende Eigenschaft durch jahrhundertelange Erfahrung und durch moderne chemische Analysen best\u00e4tigt. Man kann den Feldmannstreu auch als Nahrungsmittel und Gew\u00fcrz benutzen. Die jungen Sch\u00f6sslinge dieser Pflanzen lassen sich gut als Salat zubereiten, die jungen Bl\u00e4tter des Feldmannstreu k\u00f6nnen wie Gurken in Weinessig eingelegt oder mit Zucker eingemacht werden.\n\nDer Feldmannstreu  ist eine mehrj\u00e4hrig wachsende, krautige Pflanze, die eine Wuchsh\u00f6he von 60 bis 80 cm erreichen kann. Die wei\u00dflich-gr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten St\u00e4ngel dieser Heilpflanzen sind kr\u00e4ftig verzweigt und bebl\u00e4ttert. Die Farbe der derben, fiederteiligen, starren und dornig gez\u00e4hnten Bl\u00e4tter ist wei\u00dflich-gr\u00fcn. Die oberen Bl\u00e4tter wachsen an kurzen Stielen, die Bl\u00e4tter im oberen Bereich der Pflanze wachsen st\u00e4ngelumfassend ohne Stiele.

Immediately add the sugar followed by the egg whites. Whisk together over the simmering water until you can't feel the sugar grains when you rub the mixture between your fingers.\n\nTransfer mixture into a stand mixer if desired or leave it in the bowl and and whip with an electric hand mixer until it turns white and about doubles in volume.\n\nBlend in the vanilla.\n\n\nAdd the butter in about 3 additions or so and continue to whip until the mixture gets thick and you think that it is thick enough to decorate with.\n\nThis buttercream does not get a crust on the surface and it stays fluffy even after sitting overnight (does not flatten).  Because of the egg whites, you would need to refrigerate the decorated cakes/cupcakes after they are frosted.\n\nThis frosting is light, creamy and wonderful.  It is not sickly sweet like some other buttercream frosting and I will be using this one for future projects.\n\nI have no idea why this is called \"Swiss\" buttercream and I'm sure I will hear about how they don't make this frosting this way in Switzerland.  \n\nNext cupcake is a fish!

If you are taking antidepressants, you should talk to your doctor before drinking alcohol. The drug you are taking and your current emotional and physical state should be considered in deciding if you can safely drink alcohol while taking your medication. But generally, mixing antidepressants and alcohol is discouraged. A few things could happen if you mix antidepressants and alcohol. First, your medication may become ineffective in treating your depression. Alcohol acts a depressant, so by drinking it, you could counteract effects of your medication and lessen their benefit. The side effects from your medication could also worsen. Some antidepressants cause drowsiness, and so does alcohol. Mixing the two could make you sleepy, which is dangerous in situations where you need to be alert, such as driving, or at work. Studies have proved that even social drinking may impair your ability to react quickly and remain alert while driving, even hours after consuming a single alcoholic drink. Finally, if you are taking an antidepressant that is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), mixing it with alcohol can be very dangerous. The combination can cause a dangerous spike in blood pressure, leading to a stroke. Your doctor may tell you to avoid both alcohol and certain types of foods which may also interact with your medicine, such as cheeses and certain meats, if you are on an MAOI. Antidepressants are not the only medications that could dangerously interact with alcohol. Whenever you are prescribed a new medication, talk to your doctor about consuming alcoholic drinks. Try not to drink alcohol. Alcohol on its own can make your depression worse, but it can also make you slow and drowsy if you are taking antidepressants. This can lead to problems with driving - or with anything you need to concentrate on.

[polite, respectful applause and coughs between movements] Now a shout out to all the DMB/Beethoven mash-up fans out there! [cricket \u2026 cricket \u2026] Introducing \u2026 Ants Marching / Ode to Joy!\n\nOK, so this tune started in sound check at one of our shows. We were playing around with that super catchy lick at the front end of DMB\u2019s \u201cAnts Marching.\u201d Using a loop pedal we\u2019d set up the chords then improv on top of them. It then evolved. We did things like mimic the snare hit on beats 2 and 4 using a padded piano bench. We created a unique fiddle-like sound by combining a 5 string electric cello and a bowed piano string (using a disassembled cello bow.) We used a myriad of muted piano and piano percussion sounds. Then we developed the loop effect farther so that 4 guys could play a lot more parts together. \n\nLike most of our music, ALL OF THE SOUNDS YOU HEAR WERE CREATED BY PIANO & CELLO (with the help of a tambourine).\nOde to Joy crept its way in because, well, throwing classical licks into pop tune arrangements is one of the things we love to do, but we also loved that, though the two melodies melded well, the lyrics or \u201cmessages\u201d of the two tunes starkly contrasted each other. Poetic irony, right? DMB\u2019s tune talks of everyone doing the same thing (um\u2026like ants marching) and implies a meaningless, despondent and monotonous isolation of human beings from one another, while Beethoven\u2019s \u201ctune\u201d talks of friendship, brotherhood, interconnectedness, meaning, and, of course, joy.  \n\nWe filmed this in ONE TAKE (meaning no cuts or alternative angles) using an octocopter with an attached gimbal (pivoted support).

Unique and patented features of the EP-560 include: the ankle comfort dial and ergo embrace specialty form for a secure and comfortable fit. Comfort Trak bed design to maximize spinal comfort and flex with the user to enhance joint mobilization and decompression. Its innovative Trak design accommodates the optional acupressure nodes and Lumbar Bridge accessories to enhance your decompression experience. Grip-and-Stretch Handles for enhanced stretching and realignment. Precision balancing for controlled rotation. Heat treated steel for unsurpassed strength. Industry leading 5 year warranty, quick and easy assembly, folds in seconds for compact storage, customizable with Teeter accessories, and guaranteed excellence with engineering. \n\nShopping on the internet is a challenge when relying on small images and reviews with only after a few weeks of use. Don\u2019t be deceived by cheap lookalikes. Look for a quality guarantee that give you confidence in your purchase. Only Teeter offers certified quality by UL, an independent product testing and safety organization that sets standards for thousands of products that you use in your home. UL 1647 is the only standard with requirements for inversion tables, and currently Teeter Hang Ups offers the only table certified with that standard. Look at these shocking results of an engineering study that tested 4 widely distributed lookalikes to UL safety requirements. All experienced catastrophic failure with broken, bent, and torn metal. Average endurance was only 10% of the UL standard and average strength was only 30% of the required safety factor. Why take a chance on a lookalike that doesn\u2019t even come close to meeting basic safety standards? I\u2019ve been a believer in inversion for over 30 years and I\u2019m committed to providing you the highest quality and safest product that brings results. My name is my promise to you.

Libra loves admiration, of course we all do, but Libra likes to be thought of as special. So if immediately you can give attention to the Librans and be someone who has a certain inborn elegance, or artistic nature, or creative nature, the Libra will immediately be attracted.\n\nThe seduction of a Libra is somewhat complicated because Libra also doesn't like someone who comes on too quickly. Libra wants to get to know you a little bit. Libra is however, I'd say overwhelmed by a sense that you know how to live a good life, good in the sense of luxurious. A Libra woman usually loves to have a glass of champagne. A libra man likes to have you elegantly dressed, know your manners, and know how to speak correctly. \n\nSo again when I talk about a Libran it sounds as if the Libra is very choosey it's true, but Libra really wants to be understood, to be cared about, as I suppose we all do, but Libra wants that up front, wants you to show the Libran that you find him or her fascinating, interesting, elegant, beautifully appointed. In general the Libra like to go to places, let's say you're going to dinner, places that are quiet, well appointed in terms of candlelight, nice wine. Libra is really not a rough and tumble person.", "title": "How to Seduce a Libra | Zodiac Love Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-02-23T19:17:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "17NCHN4VPCw", "description": "1:24 to skip the intro.\n\nFollow and Chat with me at:\n**Instagram: KayleyMelissa\n**Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/kayleymelissa\n**Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/kayleymelissa\n**Twitter: http://twitter.com/kayleymelissa\n**Second Channel: www.youtube.com/letsmakeitup2\n**For business inquiries please email my manager:  evegail@melroseandpark.com with \"Kayley Melissa\" in the subject line \n\nWhat you'll need: \nBobby pins\nHair band\n\nProducts I used\nConair secure hold bobby pins\nHair band (by Conair)\n\nWhat I'm wearing:\nShirt: TJ Maxx\nNails: Butter London - chimney sweep and Zoya - Charla\n\nMakeup:\nFoundation:\n-Revlon Colorstay for Combo/Oily Skin\n-Estee Lauder Double Wear Powder\nBlush: Rimmel Blush Autumn Catwalk\nEyeshadow:\n-Mixed a lot of colors from the Shady Lady vol 2 pallet by The Balm\nLiner: Physicians formula gel liner\nMascara: Revlon Double Twist\nLips:\nnothing\n\nThanks for watching! :)", "title": "Blair's 5 Minute Ponytail from Gossip Girl", "publishedDate": "2011-10-26T23:24:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "17NHaB9HpKU", "description": "", "title": "Jesse", "publishedDate": "2014-01-30T07:14:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "17NMhswEpjU", "description": "Get your own snake hat here: imasnake.bigcartel.com\nThis is the original video footage from a lovely August day when I decided to put on a snake hat and start rambling.", "title": "I'm a Snake [ The Unedited Director's Cut ] As Seen on Web Soup", "publishedDate": "2011-04-09T18:09:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "17O9cxuopdE", "description": "how to cook, crock pot recipes, oxtail, curry chicken recipe COOKLIKEJAMAICANS.COM", "title": "Oxtail Curry Chicken Healthy Recipes part 7", "publishedDate": "2013-07-28T18:45:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "17OIP5XpwFs", "description": "Voor Smos het duidelijk waar Safety First voor staat.

This was then developed as the picture took shape, with the branched protruding from the central stem to encompass all areas of Science Technology Engineering and Maths.\nWe chose to produce the art work on a covered area of the school yard for maximum impact and as a result we were able to explain the concept to the many passers by who were keen to learn more and get involved themselves next year.\nWe also learnt a bit about time lapse photography ourselves during the process and this is something we would like to develop in our club to record our efforts as we go.\nWe hope you enjoy the end result as much as we did. \"", "title": "Bio Art Attack   I   11-18 years Shortlist  I   STEM", "publishedDate": "2014-10-01T15:15:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "17p6pXvZO9k", "description": "Subscribe for new episodes: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ehowhome\n\nAllen gets an early start on his gardening by planting some spinach seeds in a raised bed.\n\nHave any questions for P.

Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.[7]\nIn food science and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch (such as cereals, bread, and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts).", "title": "CARBS MAKE YOU FAT", "publishedDate": "2013-09-11T15:35:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "18EO0UKLWoY", "description": "New Marsupial Species Dies During Sex, 'Promiscuous' Black-Tailed\nAntechinus Mates For Hours Until Its Body Shuts Down", "title": "New Marsupial Species Dies During Sex, 'Promiscuous' Black-Tailed Antechinus Mates For...", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T02:52:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "18EQuhJfOvY", "description": "Text-only transcript: http://www.caes.uga.edu/global/media/texttranscript.cfm?vid=18EQuhJfOvY\n\nStudy Horticulture: http://students.caes.uga.edu/undergraduate/majors/horticulture.cfm\n\nGraduates from the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at UGA have many job opportunities in the state of Georgia and around the world.\n\n---\nLaura Ney\nDescriptive Text for Video\n\nThe scene opens in Costa Rica with Laura Ney, a female student, sitting in front of a bank of green palm fronds.

I'm Deborah Nance and today I'm going to talk about the Pros & Cons of a reverse mortgage.\n\nWhich do you want to hear first?....... Okay we'll go over the cons first... the negatives.\n\nThe first negative is the fact that when a persona with a reverse mortgage dies, the heirs will inherit a home with a lien on it.  A lien that needs to paid off within 6 months!  (Heirs may be able to also get two 90 day extensions to payoff) So, if it is crucially important to you to leave your kids a home that is free and clear.  You will want to find another solution besides a reverse mortgage.  On the other hand if you feel like you've provided for your kids by raising them and teaching them to be independent, honest and hardworking and they do not expect or want you to leave them your home free and clear. Then a reverse mortgage might just work for you.\n\nThe second negative is Closing costs!  A reverse mortgage has closing costs and they can be more than the closing costs on a traditional mortgage.  So... It is very important to compare lenders and get the best rates and fees.\n\nThe next negative is that the balance on a reverse mortgage grows over time.  You will owe more on the house in 10 years than you do after the first year.   The only way to avoid this is to make payments on the reverse mortgage. (yes you can make payments on a reverse if you want to) though most never do.\n\nIf you spend all of the money from your reverse mortgage and the balance grows, some day when you are REALLY old, you may become sick and need money.  If you have used up all of the funds in your reverse mortgage, what options will you have to get more money?  You may be in a position where you have to sell and you won't recieve as much from the sale of your home had you never done the reverse mortgage.\n\nThe pros -  The biggest pro of all is the fact that you do not ever have to make mortgage payments on a reverse.  You can if you wish, but it is never required. If you used the reverse mortgage to payoff your mortgage, you just increased your cash flow! Just imagine - no more mortgage payments - EVER. This \"raise\" will free up cash that you can put into savings for future emergencies and may also provide you with additional cash from the reverse mortgage itself in the form of a credit line or monthly payments to you.\n\nThe next positive is the Credit Line Growth. A reverse mortgage credit line grows over time!  This is a great feature of the reverse mortgage. If you choose the credit line option on a reverse mortgage the lender can not cut off your credit line just because home values fall.  In fact the credit line grows over time at a rate equal to the loan rate plus 1.25%.  This could be a huge benefit down the road, especially if you refrain from withdrawing funds from the line of credit and just let that credit line grow and grow.  Over time you would have access to much more money.  If you never have and emergency and do not need to ever take the funds from the line of credit, then you haven't borrowed those funds and your heirs would have a much lower balance to payoff when they inherit your home.\n\nA reverse mortgage can be a great tool for retirement but it's not for everyone.

Cownose rays grow rapidly, and male rays often reach about 35 inches (89 cm) in width and weigh 26 pounds (12 kg). Females typically reach 28 inches (71 cm) in width and weigh 36 pounds (16 kg). The embryo grows within its mother with its wings folded over its body. Initially it is nourished by an egg yolk, although the uterine secretions of the mother nourish it later in its development. There is some dispute about the length of gestation. At full term the offspring is born live, exiting tail first. The cownose ray is 11 to 18 inches (28 to 46 cm) in width at birth. A mature specimen can grow to 45 inches (1.1 m) in width, and weigh 50 pounds (23 kg) or more. There is some controversy over the size that a mature cownose ray can reach. A ray reaching a span of 84 inches has been recorded. A cownose ray is typically brown-backed with a whitish or yellowish belly. Although its coloration is not particularly distinctive, its shape is easily recognizable. It has a broad head with wide-set eyes, and a pair of distinctive lobes on its subrostral fin. It also has a set of dental plates designed for crushing clams and oyster shells. There are a series of canine teeth that are hidden behind the dental plates. When threatened the cownose ray can use the barb at the base of its tail to defend itself from the threat. A cownose ray has a stinger, called a spine, on its tail, close to the ray's body. This spine has teeth lining its lateral edges, and is coated with a weak venom that causes symptoms similar to that of a bee sting.", "title": "On Location: The Cow-Nose Ray", "publishedDate": "2012-08-20T00:08:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "18iKRsQlysc", "description": "some guy singing in a made up language", "title": "thoth central park", "publishedDate": "2006-06-15T16:36:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "18iKSE5z6CI", "description": "This film is a part of report titled \"Pankaj Oudhia's Healing Herbs for Unique Symptoms.\" by Pankaj Oudhia.
