Let's see how this works:\n\nIt starts with you drafting what's called a Provisional Patent Application.\nA provisional patent application is very easy to write because there are no formal requirements- all you need is a written description of your Invention.\nCan you describe your Invention in words? If so, you could file a provisional patent application.\n\nThe benefit of a provisional is that it gets you an early filing date and patent pending status for 12 months. Once you have that, you can disclose your Invention without fear of losing patenting rights.\nBecause drafting a provisional is so easy, tens of thousands of Inventors draft their own provisional patent application.\n\nOnce it's in, all you have to do is file your FULL patent application within 12 months, and claim priority BACK to your provisional, and you can get that early date of protection. If you go OVER the 12 months, you CAN'T claim back, because a provisional only lasts 12 months. So a provisional, in and of itself, will never be searched and examined at the patent office, but it's a PLACE-SETTER that you can claim priority back to. And the biggest benefit is the price- the USPTO charge less than $100 for a provisional.\nWhen it comes to your FULL patent application, which you'll have done either by a patent attorney, or you'll need the program iPatentWriter, you'll need 4 parts of your application.\nBut when you file a provisional, the only requirement is a written description of your Invention- and it will STILL generate you a patent application number and 12 months patent pending status, at a fraction of the cost of a full patent application.\n\nThe best thing is, not only can you use your US provisional patent application number to claim back to when you file your FULL US patent application at the USPTO, but you can ALSO use it to claim priority back to when you file full applications at most patent offices throughout the world, So your provisional patent application gets you patent pending INTERNATIONALLY.\nAgain, you must file your full patent applications within 12 months and claim priority back to your Provisional Patent Application Number in order to be able to get that early date of protection. If you go OVER the 12 months, you can't claim back.\niPatentPending, the entry level program from Shiine\u2122, shows you how to draft your provisional patent application, and also includes a full screen capture tutorial of how to FILE your provisional patent application online via the USPTO website and get your OFFICIAL provisional patent application number in just minutes.\n\nIf you'd like to go straight ahead and get iPatentPending now, click here: http://shiine-enterprise.com/ipatentpending.trial.html", "title": "How A Provisional Patent Application Works", "publishedDate": "2013-11-02T16:47:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "BIl-uo7p0S0", "description": "Video 33 of 366 in my 2012 One Video A Day (OVAD) series.\n\nThe average-ness of my new life.\n\nStalk Me Here:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/NerdHeather\nhttp://www.HeatherJacklin.com\nhttp://lizlemonequalsme.tumblr.com\nhttp://theTVsisters.com", "title": "It's Thursday", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T20:29:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BIlPA5H2lCE", "description": "In this video, Dan Furman of Cricket Hill Garden demonstrates how to deadhead a tree peony.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

It consists of a superficial and a deep part, both originating from the zygomatic arch. \n\nThe superficial part inserts on the masseteric tuberosity at the outer surface of the mandibular angle, whereas the deep part runs further dorsally to the outer surface of the mandibular ramus. \n\nAt that point, the muscle can be easily palpated from the oral cavity along the cheek. Furthermore, part of the deep fibers radiates into the anterior capsule and articular disc of the temporomandibular joint. \n\nThe parotid gland lies on the lateral side of the masseter with its duct coursing underneath the zygomatic arch across the muscle. As all muscles of mastication, the masseter is supplied by a branch of the mandibular nerve, the masseteric nerve.\n\nFor more Human Anatomy video tutorials, interactive quizzes, articles and an atlas of Human Anatomy, go to https://www.kenhub.com !\n\nOr subscribe to our Youtube channel: http://bit.ly/VOEG2I\nLike us on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/kenhubcom\nFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/kenHub_com\n\nArticles related to this video\n=============================\n\nMasseter Muscle\nhttps://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/masseter-muscle\n\nMuscles of Mastication\nhttps://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/the-muscles-of-mastication\n\nAtlas related to this video\n=============================\n\nMuscles of Mastication\nhttps://www.kenhub.com/en/atlas/muscles-of-mastication", "title": "Masseter Muscle - Function, Origin, Insertion & Innervation - Human Anatomy |\u00a0Kenhub", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T05:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJA-KARVRfM", "description": "http://www.bcu.ac.uk/aston-student-villages\nDiscover what it's like to live in the heart of Birmingham, just a short walk from our City Centre Campus.\nThis modern campus has 200 single en-suite study rooms which all have basic free internet access.", "title": "Student accommodation at BCU: Aston Student Village", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T08:34:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJAZVN4ZzBU", "description": "random chanty unforbid aurei pertinacity misforming wherever zoccolo specimens urdee afghani unmasks urdee hanselling ectotherms unjustly proliferates billeted taha misforming delves toyings amateurish reponing xmas trust merest means gamekeepers intellectually urbanize poring shoggled pretensions howker coexistence untethers lepidolite ogdoad midsummers directed cursors singlets altarpiece lathy backaches comp\u00e8ring stagery mummed kirks\n\nembedment,terrae,corpse,elfins,cembalo,cultivator,topers,mridanga,vacantly,adolescent,fornix,mergences,anastatic,gesture,pellagra,abbreviating,bucolical", "title": "altarpiece lathy backaches comp\u00e8ring stagery mummed kirks", "publishedDate": "2012-06-19T15:13:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJAnPhpC6-I", "description": "http://www.greenemath.com/\n\nIn this video we demonstrate how to simplify a fractional expression.

It is considered as the start of the New Year among Iranians. The name comes from Avestan meaning \"new day/daylight\". Noruz is celebrated March 20/21 each year, at the time the sun enters Aries. Haft Sin or the seven 'S's is a most important tradition of Nowruz, Iranian new year. The haft sin table includes seven items which should be starting with the letter S or Sin (\u0633 in Farsi alphabet). The items symbolically mark to seven creations and holy immortal protecting them.\n\nOriginally called Haft Chin, the Haft Sin has evolved over time, but has kept its symbolism. Iranians try to set as beautiful Haft S\u00een table as they can, as it is not only of traditional and spiritual value, but also noticed by visitors during Nowruzi visitations and is a reflection of their good taste.\n\nThis year my Haft Sin had more than seven \"S\". Just bcs i could not choose among too many \"S\"s i had.\n\nThe main items are:\n\n1. Sabzeh -- wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish -- symbolizing rebirth\n2. Samanu -- a sweet pudding made from wheat germ -- symbolizing affluence\n3. Senjed -- the dried fruit of the oleaster tree -- symbolizing love\n4. Sir -- garlic -- symbolizing medicine\n5. Sib -- apples -- symbolizing beauty and health\n6. Somaq -- sumac berries -- symbolizing (the color of) sunrise\n7. Serkeh -- vinegar -- symbolizing age and patience\n\nI didn't have a missing \"S\". But i would like to add these below items too.

They send their stooge Kanakaraj to assassinate Krishnadeva Raya, but Kanakaraj fails \nin his mission and is put to death. Then they planned courtesan Krishnasini. Krishnasini enters Vijayanagaram, and \nwith her acclaimed dancing skills, manages to elicit the notice of the King, a great connoisseur of arts and beauty. She then plays her cards cleverly and besotted by her intelligent repartees and smoldering sensuousness, the susceptible King is soon a puppet in her hands. Orders are given that anyone who enters their private chamber would be beheaded and the King spends with Krishnasini's for months. Reports reach the ministers that the Sultans are planning to take advantage of the King's inaccessibility and launch a combined attack on Vijayanagaram. Worried at the state of affairs, Tenali Raman braves the prohibitory order and enters Krishnasini's abode dressed as a woman, but all his appeals to the King seem to fall on deaf ears. Meanwhile Queen Tirumalamba falls seriously sick and the King finally comes out of his daze. Once the King is at his wife's bedside, Tenali Ramakrishna \nmanages to gain entry into Krishnasini's house again, this time under the guise of an omniscient saint who assures \nher that he would bring the King back to her. He catches her red-handed with her gang of spies, and signals to the \nhidden soldiers to surround her. Realized that the game is up, Krishnasini prefers a dignified death. Shocked to see \nher stab herself, Timmarusu remonstrates with her that she has acted in haste, for the King would have certainly \nforgiven her.\n\nWatch more movies @\nhttp://www.youtube.com/volgavideo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/newvolgavideo/videos?view=1", "title": "Tenali Ramakrishna Songs - Meka Tokak Toka Meka (Padyalu -- Dialogues)  - ANR, NTR", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T06:30:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJFFLb245xM", "description": "The G major, along with every other scale, has different modes which are determined by the starting and ending note played in the scale.

He was taken to the Lakeland Regional Medical Center for treatment and returned home Tuesday afternoon.\n \nTommie A. Lanier, 66, of 911 Quincy St. in Lakeland, was struck three times when officers returned his gunfire, police said. He was in critical condition at LRMC on Tuesday night. His arrest report says he received surgery for his wounds.\n \nA warrant has been issued charging Lanier with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer.\n \nLakeland Police Department detailed in a news briefing, press releases and Lanier's arrest report how the shooting occurred:\n \nOfficers began pursuing the man about 10:30 a.m. when they received information that a wanted person was in the area of 100 W. Parker St.\n \nMills and Sgt. Jeff Gary, 54, arrived in the area to search for the suspect. They found Lanier, who matched the suspect's description, walking from North Lake Wire Park toward Florence Avenue.\n \nOfficers stopped Lanier in the front yard of a home at 800 N. Florence Ave., about a half mile from Lanier's address. He backed up and pulled a gun from under his shirt.\n \nHe fired at Mills twice as the men stood about 12 to 15 feet apart. Mills was exiting his motorcycle when the shots were fired.\n \nMills and Gary immediately returned fire, hitting Lanier. \n \nInvestigators are unsure why he fired on Mills and Gary. They later determined Lanier was not the same person initially reported to officers.\n \nPolice rushed to LRMC for word of Mills' condition. He returned home Tuesday to recover.\n \n\"We're very proud of him today and the way he responded to this type of encounter,\" Assistant Chief Mike Link said.\n \nLink was among the officers who crowded into the emergency room after the shooting.\n \n\"I was able to walk into the room and see Doug for just a few minutes,\" he said. \"They were examining [him] still and treating [him] a little bit, but he was in good spirits. As best as he could [be] under the circumstances. Definitely in a little bit of pain, obviously.\"\n \nAccording to Lanier's arrest report, a bullet was found between Mills' shirt and body armor, but investigators don't know if it was the same one that injured him.\n \nThe officers discovered the Lanier was carrying three additional guns. Officers are unsure how many times he was struck. The agency is also now reporting they are unsure if he was the same many wanted by Polk County deputies.\n \nLakeland Police and the State Attorney's Office are investigating the shooting. \n \nMills, who joined LPD in December 2008, and Gary have been put on leave pending an investigation, which is common in police-involved shootings.", "title": "Lakeland Officer and Suspect Injured in Shooting", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T21:39:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJRgQVjjyxg", "description": "In some countries, it's considered a compliment", "title": "Drive By Belching 3", "publishedDate": "2011-11-14T00:37:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJRj-TpSZd0", "description": "Simoniz Products at your local professional car wash.", "title": "Simoniz  | Jingle Spot", "publishedDate": "2010-11-16T21:02:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJRra2DtDgo", "description": "http://shop.howtechs.com\nThis video shows you how to insert and remove the Nano SIM card on HTC Desire 816.\n\nIf you like this video, please subscribe and leave a comment.

Touching it to the steel wool sends a current through the thin wire and it heats up a lot ... to about 700 degrees C. These temperatures cause the iron to react with oxygen in the air creating iron oxide. This reaction releases heat, which heats up the next bit of iron and so on, causing a cascading reaction across the steel wool. Of course, remember that this reaction requires oxygen. Fluffing it up and then spinning it of course, increases the amount of oxygen available, hence speeding up the reaction and giving us the amazing display that we used for our photographs... cool huh!", "title": "Spinning Steel Wool for Science + 5000 subscriber Thank You!", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T17:43:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJWjbpA_zIc", "description": "Wayne Handley's custom built Turbine Powered \"Raven\" experienced an engine malfunction.

The Russian company \"High-energy battery systems\" has been working on this type of secondary power source since 1999 under the leadership of Alexander Potanin, PhD in technical sciences.A lanthanum fluoride battery represents a fundamentally new class of secondary elements - solid-state batteries. Its anode is made of lanthanum, and the cathode - of fluoride bismuth or lead. Barium lanthanum fluoride is used as the electrolyte, besides this electrolyte is hard.The battery production technology consists of covering anode and cathode electrodes in a solid solution of lanthanum and barium fluoride. The element is formed by AC voltage of a sinusoidal form of industrial frequency at 800 degrees, resulting in reduction of internal resistance of the element that increases its maximum output current.During the subsequent charge - discharge cycles, the current source with the open circuit voltage of 3.7 V had stable discharge characteristics at a voltage level to 1.5 V. The theoretical energy consumption is up to 750 W \u2022 h / kg. The capacitance per unit volume is over 1330 W \u2022 h / dm2.A lanthanum - fluoride battery can be used as part of long continuous systems at normal temperature; in the autonomous power sources for operation at high temperatures; in the thermal reserve batteries of different capacities and duration of action, for example, for starter run of diesel engines.Currently, this type of battery is the optimum combination of high specific electric power with operational safety and small size.", "title": "Lanthanum Fluoride Battery", "publishedDate": "2012-01-13T00:28:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJb1K5TXlKs", "description": "The gators and the squeeters are gettin there with a full of us swampers line up!

You can tell female and male cockroaches from one another by the differences in their abdominal tips. Females and males both have a pair of cerci,  male cockroaches also have a pair of styli. Cerci and styli are sense organs. The female cockroach's internal reproductive organs consist of a pair of ovaries in which its eggs are formed, and a duct that leads from the ovaries to the outside of the insect. Next to the duct is a pouch in which the male's sperms are stored. The sperms fertilize the eggs.  \nA gland  that encloses fertilized eggs in a leathery case is also part of the reproductive organs. This egg case is called an ootheca. It protects the developing fertilized eggs. The ootheca can be seen protruding from a female's rear end before it is deposited on the ground outside the female's body. The male cockroach's internal reproductive organs include a pair of testes. Sperm is produced in each testis. Ducts lead from the testes out of the male cockroach's body to deliver sperm to the female cockroach. There are a number of glands along the duct that secrete substances that help sperm fertilize the eggs.

Construction worker Elvis Romeo Lingurar, 24 was working on a demolition site when he lost his balance and fell off scaffolding, smashing his head on the concrete below. The impact of the six foot fall shattered Elvis' skull on his left side, and doctors were forced to remove the bone in order to save his life. Mr Lingurar, from Livada, north-west Romania spent several days in a coma where doctors battled to save his life. However, in the daze following the coma, he did not realise the extent of his injuries until he removed the bandages upon leaving the hospital a fortnight later. Without the left-hand side of his skull, Mr Lingurar's brain is protected by only a thin layer of skin, leaving him unable to work as the slightest knock to his head could prove fatal. Mr Lingurar could undergo surgery to have the missing part of his skull replaced with a prosthetic, but he is unable to afford the \u00a3900 procedure. Journalist Alex Prunean, 25, filmed an interview with Mr Lingurar in a bid to highlight his plight. He said: 'The accident happened a year ago and left Elvis in an extremely serious condition, he spent several days in a coma at the Clinic of Neurosurgery in Cluj Napoca, Romania. 'His skull was seriously broken, his head bruised and he had to undergo surgery after he formed a blood clot on the brain, but miraculously, he recovered. 'If doctors hadn't removed half of his skull, he would have died. The piece of skull that is missing can be replaced with a prosthetic, but the man is poor and cannot afford this. 'Elvis called and asked for my help as he hopes if people hear his story they may be able to help.'\n\n- Read more at: http://gistonthis.com/construction-worker-loses-half-skull-smashing-head-concrete/", "title": "Construction Worker Loses Half His Skull After Smashing His Head On Concrete", "publishedDate": "2014-04-19T21:01:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "BJiHtZgM3Jo", "description": "A hardware based anti-collision solution like PIEZO is more sensitive and works faster than a typical software based solution.

Both the adults and larvae can defoliate lilies (Lilium and Cardiocrinum) and fritillaries (Fritillaria). Adults are 8mm long, bright red with a black head and legs. Eggs are 1mm long and orange-red, found in groups on the underside of lily and fritillary leaves. Larvae have orange bodies with black heads but are normally covered with their own slimy black excrement. The fully grown larvae are 8-10mm long. The pupal stage is in the soil. :  http://www.rhs.org.uk/science/plant-pests/lily-beetle \n\nThe scarlet lily beetle, red lily beetle, or lily leaf beetle  - Lilioceris lilii - , is a leaf beetle that eats the leaves, stem, buds, and flower, of lilies, fritillaries and other members of the family Liliaceae. It lays its eggs most often on Lilium and Fritillaria species. In the absence of Lilium and Fritillaria species, there are fewer eggs laid and the survival rate of eggs and larvae is reduced.  It is now a pest in most temperate climates where lilies are cultivated. The beetle overwinters in the soil and emerges early in spring. The adult is generally found in moist, cool environments. It emerges in spring to feed and mate. The female can lay up to 450 eggs each season in batches of about 12 on the undersides of leaves. It arranges the eggs in irregular lines along the midrib, where they are more concealed. The eggs hatch in about 6 days and the larvae feed for up to 24 days, beginning underneath the leaf then working up the rest of the plant. They then burrow in the ground to pupate in a cocoon of soil bound with saliva. In about 20 days they emerge as adults and continue to feed until winter. More than one cycle can occur in one year. : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Beetle\n\nBiology and Behaviour of the Lily Beetle : http://www.lilies.org/pdfs/lilybeetle.pdf\n\nPicking beetles off can be adequate, if you like picking up bugs that are covered in their excrement. : http://www.amateurgardening.com/home/red-alert-over-monty-dons-lily-beetle-tip/\n\nDavid Rudwick  - Gardens and Greenhouse at work - West Lavington. horticulture\n\nUnfortunately handheld, with such a macro and a minuscule depth of field the video is shaky and not always on focus.

Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez and other A-list actresses contribute voice performances to the film, which features original music from Academy Award winner Rachel Portman, in collaboration with Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe film spotlights unforgettable girls like Sokha, an orphan who rises from the dumps of Cambodia to become a star student and an accomplished dancer; Suma, who composes music to help her endure forced servitude in Nepal and today crusades to free others; and Ruksana, an Indian \"pavement-dweller\" whose father sacrifices his own basic needs for his daughter's dreams. Each girl is paired with a renowned writer from her native country. Edwidge Danticat, Sooni Taraporevala Aminatta Forna and others tell the girls' stories, each in it's style, and all with profound resonance. \n\nThese girls are each unique, but the obstacles they faced are ubiquitous.

Dhyana or meditation is the seventh of the eight steps in the ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali and is part of the Antaranga or inner steps of Yoga.  It is preceded by Dharana or one-pointed concentration that helps us to flow into meditation. The final step in the three free-flowing highest states of consciousness is samadhi or union with the divine nature and the ultimate union in the universal unification. Maharishi Patanjali is the codifier of Yoga Darshana, the yogic view of life. He defines dharana or concentration as desha bandha chitasya dharana meaning thereby that concentration is the process of binding the Consciousness to a point, place, region or object.  This implies a duality between the seer and the seen. He further defines dhyana or meditation as tatra pratyaya ekatantha dhyanam meaning a state in which there is steady and continuous flow of attention and concentration on a point, place, region or object. There ceases to be a duality between the seer and the seen. The one-pointedness of concentration of Dharana raises the yogi into the highest stages of mind where the buddhi or intellect is available as an instrument of the cosmic mind. When free flowing concentration is achieved it is known as dhyana or meditation. Meditation is not thinking as so many mistake it to be today.

The majority of these species is found in nature as wild mangoes. They all belong in the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae. The mango is native to South Asia, from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics. The highest concentration of Mangifera genus is situated in western part of Malesia (Sumatra, Java and Borneo) and in Burma and India. While other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, M. foetida) are also grown on a more localized basis, Mangifera indica -- the 'common mango' or 'Indian mango' -- is the only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions. It is originated in India and Burma. It is the national fruit of India and the Philippines and the national tree of Bangladesh. In several cultures, its fruit and leaves are ritually used as floral decorations at weddings, public celebrations and religious ceremonies.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

'Naga babu' is playing the role of this sincere police officer.. New face 'lakshana' is playing the heroine role and 'gayatri rao' of 'happy days' fame is playing an important role in this movie ...ACP jayachandra (nagababu) is a sincere police officer. He could not control his emotion and wants to remain an upright officer. He will never backtrack or compromise in punishing the criminals. He leaves no stone unturned to catch the culprits or to encounter them. At one point of time, due to his emotional attack, an innocent (Ali) dies in the hands of goons. From then onwards, he changes his mindset and stops moving fast. Instead, he maintains cool and start gathering all the details about the culprit before going to arrest them are encounter them. He gets posted in Hyderabad. His wife aruna (lakshana) joins the college as a lecturer. There is another lecturer (pruthvi) in the college, who has more social consciousness. When the leaders of government and the opposition quarrel over the privatisation of some sugar factories and 25 each from both the groups resign forcing the election commission to hold by-elections. The lecturer files public interest litigation (pil) in the high court that holding of by-elections will cause a lot of expenditure on the exchequer and pleads for directions that no politician should resign and in case he resigns, he himself should bear the expenditure for the by-elections.this point irks the politicians, who use goons and get him murdered. Incidentally, aruna records the murder in her cell phone. By using the cell phone, ACP jaya blackmails the goons and collects huge money from them. Not only from goons, he also collects money from the politicians, who abetted the crime. At the same time, he keeps all the evidence in a computer. Learning that the ACP cheated them, the students, who gave him the evidence, try to kidnap him only to find that the ACP is none other than their lecturer's husband and an upright police officer. The ACP chalks out a plan and gathers all the goons in one place and takes everyone into his custody. He keeps everyone in a secluded place. Realising the threat to them, if the goons were produced in the court, the politicians try to get them released with the help of a corrupt CBI officer (satya prakash). However, jaya foils all those plans. As their plans foiled, the CBI officer kidnaps aruna and make jaya believe that she committed suicide. However, the groups of students are informed that she is safe and she would be released only if they turn hostile witnesses.

Harry (Jared Leto), and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are impoverished heroin addicts living in Coney Island, NY, while Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is a fellow addict trying to distance herself from her wealthy father. Harry dreams of scoring a pound of smack, from which he could make enough money to open a clothing boutique with Marion, but so far he and his friends can barely scrape by supporting their own habits. Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), who spends her days watching television, is told she has the opportunity to appear on her favorite game show; wanting to lose enough weight to fit into her favorite red dress, she visits a sleazy doctor who gives her a prescription for amphetamines. Soon Sara has a drug habit of her own that is spiraling out of control. Requiem for a Dream was directed by Darren Aronofsky, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Selby; it was Aronofsky's second feature, following his acclaimed independent film Pi.\n\n\"requiem for a dream\",\"requiem for a dream clip\",\"requiem for a dream song\",\"requiem for a dream trailer\",\"christopher mcdonald\",\"jennifer connelly\",\"marlon wayans\",\"jared leto\",\"ellen burstyn\",\"denise dowse\",\"marcia jean kurtz\",\"louise lasser\",\"teron a oneal\",\"darren aronofsky\",\"bandage videos\",\"cash videos\",\"couch videos\",\"hospital bed videos\",\"independent dramas\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++186747,/m/02fybl,/m/06z8gn,/m/02_l96,/m/019f2f,/m/0fgg4,/m/0c1h0c8,/m/07k5vnb,/m/06v76c", "title": "Requiem for a Dream (12/12) Movie CLIP - Fetal Position (2000) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-22T04:17:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKEL4cUTOI4", "description": "Happy Holidays!

Maybe just nibble on me a little...\n\nhttp://www.camelsandfriends.com\n\nAbout ostriches:\n\nOstriches are found in Africa and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, including extreme heat. Because they're from the desert ostriches are okay with losing up to 25% of their body weight to dehydration before becoming ill. In fact, their Latin name is Struthio camelus, after the camel. Ostriches do not bury their head in the sand, instead when threatened they run- up to 45 miles per hour. Failing that they deliver a powerful forward kick that can easily kill a lion.\n\nFun ostrich facts!\n\n - Ostriches are the world's largest bird. \n - Ostriches have THREE stomachs. \n - Ostriches have THREE sets of eyelids \n - Ostriches are the ONLY bird with two toes. \n - Ostriches can't fly, but they can run 45 MPH. \n - Ostriches are the fastest animal on two legs.\n - Ostriches have the largest eyes of any land animal. \n - Ostriches are huge: between 200-300 pounds and around 7-9 feet tall. \n - Ostriches don't have teeth, they have to swallow rocks to grind their food.\n - Ostriches live in groups led by a dominate male.\n - Ostriches are omnivores and will eat just about anything.\n - Ostriches are from Africa, but originally were found in the Middle-East, too. \n\nAbout Emu:\n\nThe emu is the second largest bird on the planet, standing nearly 6 tall, and weighing up to 120 pounds. Emus cannot fly but they are fast runners - up to 30 mph. Surprisingly, they are also strong swimmers. Some scientists consider emus to be living dinosaurs because their bones and joints are similar. Their ability to store fat allows them to go without food for long periods of time. Emus can defend themselves with tremendously powerful forward kicks. They eat great quantities of caterpillars, grasshoppers, and masses of the burrs that tangle sheep wool, which makes them helpful to farmers.", "title": "Emu defends me against attacking Ostrich", "publishedDate": "2013-11-22T19:18:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKKMcwQkkIw", "description": "Magnum Photographers \nhttp://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_14\nNew Orleans Street Photography Workshops and Photo Walks\nhttp://www.chuckjines.com/photography-workshops-2/new-orleans-street-photography-workshops/\n\nJoshua Mann Pailet\u2019s, A Gallery for Fine Photography, houses a collection of original prints that are even more exquisite than the collection located at the Art Institute of Chicago, in my opinion.

Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of the zebra, it is most closely related to the giraffe.\nThe animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in popular press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a media event in 1901. Today there are approximately 10,000--20,000 in the wild and as of 2011, 42 different institutions display them worldwide. (Wikipedia.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi).\n\nDas Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) ist ein Paarhufer aus der Familie der Giraffenartigen. N\u00e4her mit der Giraffe (Giraffa cameleopardalis) als mit anderen Paarhufern verwandt, \u00e4hnelt es in seinen K\u00f6rperproportionen eher typischen Huftieren als der Giraffe. Gekennzeichnet ist es durch seine kontrastreiche F\u00e4rbung aus rotbraun, schwarz und wei\u00df sowie den vergleichsweise langen Hals. Das Okapi bewohnt den Regenwald in Zentralafrika, und wird von der IUCN auf der Vorwarnliste f\u00fcr gef\u00e4hrdete Arten (near threatened) gef\u00fchrt.\nAls sehr scheuer Bewohner des Regenwalds ist das Okapi nur unzureichend erforscht.

(See article - \"Carlson tapped archdiocesan fund to fight gay marriage in Maine.\" at http://bit.ly/6nRyHV )\n\nThe local Catholic money was used to pay for a ballot measure called, \"Question 1,\" that asked Maine voters if they should take away the right of lesbians and gays to legally marry in their State. Unlike Proposition 8 in California, the right of marriage was already granted to same-sex couples by the Maine legislature and signed into law by Maine's (who is Catholic) Governor John Baldacci. This was a measure to take-away rights already granted.\n\nMake no doubt, Saint Louis Archbishop Carlson, along with dozens of Catholic Bishops across the United States donated over $180,000 to the Maine campaign that erased Maine's new Marriage Equality law; furthermore, they donated the money during a time when the Catholic Church is cutting, slashing and closing down parishes.\n\nIt's time for St. Louis Catholics and non-Catholics; gay and straight community; to come together and peacefully tell the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, that there are better uses for the local $10,000 Catholic dollars.\n\nLast November over 1400 St. Louisans stood on the steps of the Historic St. Louis Old Court House to show solidarity to all those affected in California after the passing of Proposition 8.\n\nOn Sunday November 29th from 11:30am to 1:30pm; in front of the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica steps, we are asking St. Louis again to stand for equality. We gather again in solidarity for those not only discriminated against in Maine - but we stand for religious tolerance and diversity in our community.\n\nSunday November 29th: there is no better date than the first day of Advent to rally for Equality. Sunday November 29th marks the first day of Advent, a time for Catholics and Christians to prepare or \"make things holy,\" before the holiday. Advent literally translates to \"coming\" and we cannot think of any better time to \"come-out\" and \"come-forward\" as a community.", "title": "Rally at Cathedral Basilica St. Louis against Archbishop Carlson Newschannel 5 at Five 11-29-2009", "publishedDate": "2009-11-30T00:06:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKRpud50MDA", "description": "Pyrophobia Drop #TheHunt3", "title": "Pyrophobia Drop #TheHunt3", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T20:42:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKS4p5B4FTU", "description": "\u25baSmartphone (Handy) Ersatzteile \u2192 http://tutopolistv.de/ersatzteile\n\u25baG\u00fcnstige Reparaturen\u2192 http://goo.gl/FK0EPe \u25baTutorialanfragen\u2192 http://goo.gl/aDjyUj\n\u25baMeine Werkzeuge http://goo.gl/UOU2Uq \u25baMeine Videoausr\u00fcstung http://goo.gl/z3jpYM\n\u25baFacebook: http://goo.gl/WhzWz \u25baInstagram: http://goo.gl/gzOhKB\n\u25baTwitter: http://goo.gl/jnJyHk \u25baG+ :http://goo.gl/O4u80M\n\n\u25d8Ich habe es mir zur Aufgabe gemacht, euren Geldbeutel zu schonen :) Eure Aufgabe ist es auf (Gef\u00e4llt mir) zu klicken und ein Abo zu hinterlassen, damit ich weiterhin Videos f\u00fcr euch produzieren kann.\n\n\u25baSollte ich euch viel Geld und \u00c4rger erspart haben und ihr wollt mich unterst\u00fctzen, dann k\u00f6nnt ihr das durch euren n\u00e4chsten Einkauf bei Amazon \u00fcber den folgenden Link: |||| Amazon: http://amzn.to/YLPJL8 |||| Das kostet euch keinen Cent extra, aber ich bin so in der Lage auch weiterhin f\u00fcr euch tolle neue Tutorials produzieren zu k\u00f6nnen!

One of my students is building a more sophisticated version with gears, interchangeable magnets and coils, and 4mm connectors to allow it to be connected to a voltmeter -  which should make it much better for teaching purposes.\n\nI use the prop to introduce EM induction to students - it is genuinely surprising to some of them to see that you can generate electricity in this way and for them to learn that this is essentially the same thing that goes on in a power station.

Regia Agata Moretti. \nIMPORTANTISSIMO PER  IMPARARE LE TABELLINE USANDO QUESTE CANZONI:\n(suggerimenti per facilitare l'apprendimento delle tabelline)\nDopo che il bambino ha  visto il video e ha , dopo un po' di volte, memorizzata la canzone ,  la  maestra (o il genitore) deve invitarlo ad  alzare un dito in pi\u00f9 delle sue mani ogni volta che nella canzone si presenta un numero nuovo. Ad es. ne \"La numerazione del 2\" quando canta 2 alzano un dito, quando cantano 4 che \u00e8 il numero che segue il 2 nella canzone, alzano un altro dito (e quindi le dita alzate adesso sono due), quando compare il 6 alzano un altro dito(e quindi adesso le dita alzate sono 3) e cos\u00ec via fino a quando arrivano a 20 (e quindi hanno 10 dita alzate).Fatto capire il gioco, la maestra chiede al bambino quanto fa ad es. 2X3 e quindi si ricanta la canzone fino a quando, con la regola prima detta , non si hanno tre dita alzate e, di conseguenza, si \"scopre\" il risultato esatto(quando ho tre dita alzate nella numerazione del 2 io sto cantando il numero 6 che quindi \u00e8 il risultato richiesto) . Naturalmente le prime volte ci si metter\u00e0 del tempo per arrivarci, ma dopo verr\u00e0 automatico rispondere subito, senza dover ricantare tutto da capo. In questo modo i bambini associano al numero di dita alzate il risultato della tabellina del 2 .\nLo stesso principio vale per \"La numerazione del 4\", \"L'Orologio 5\" ,\" La numerazione del 7\" e la parte finale de \"il Re del 9\" (che contiene sia la tabellina ,sia la numerazione).\nPrincipio simile \u00e8 da applicare a \"Grazie Signor 8!\" e a \"La Conta del 6\" dove la numerazione va avanti per i primi cinque numeri, poi viene cantata la tabellina per gli altri cinque numeri, per cui c'\u00e8 da memorizzare la sequenza di  cinque numeri per volta.\nNe \"La tabellina del 3\" si impara semplicemente la canzone.", "title": "Grazie signor 8! - video musicale - Scuola primaria Rodari di Oleggio (Novara)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-05T13:57:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKg35Ydtp4E", "description": "Get 5-star recipe for Shortbread Supreme at Watch how to make the best cut-out Christmas cookies.\n\n{ YouTube } 3-ingredient shortbread, Scottish biscuits.

No cold sweats. No kidding?\n\n\"I don't get nervous before a game,\" Milliner said with a smile Friday. \"It's still football. I've been doing this since I was 4 or 5 years old.\"\n\nMilliner, drafted No. 9 overall in April, is over the Achilles injury that limited him at times in the preseason and is slated to start opposite Antonio Cromartie in the Jets' secondary against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\"Oh, man, right now I'm just really excited to be out there and be an NFL player in my first game,\" he said. \"I know it's going to be the same thing, just a much bigger spotlight.\"\n\nMilliner was a game into his junior year at Alabama at this time a year ago, a season that would end with a second straight national title under Nick Saban. With a terrific season for the Crimson Tide, Milliner went from being left off some early mock draft lists to being considered a potential top-5 picks a few months later.\n\nAfter the Jets traded perennial Pro Bowl cornerback Darrelle Revis to Tampa Bay a few days before the draft, they jumped at the chance to fill the vacancy in the secondary with the college player many considered the most complete at his position.\n\nHe's not replacing Revis as the team's No. 1 cornerback; that's Cromartie's job. But Milliner will be counted on heavily to step in and be effective at frustrating wide receivers on a weekly basis.\n\n\"He's a young, talented kid,\" defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman said. \"He understands the defense. He knows what he's supposed to do. Can he go out and execute it? That's the most important thing. We believe he can.\n\n\"He's getting his first start. We'll see.\"\n\nMilliner played in the Jets' first two preseason games and was solid in the first at Detroit, but struggled a bit in the second against Jacksonville. After that game, in which he was beat a few times, the team revealed that Milliner had a calf injury that was affecting him.\n\nRyan let it slip recently that it was actually an Achilles injury \u2014 \"I messed up,\" the coach said \u2014 but Milliner insists he's ready to go.\n\n\"I'm fine, 100 percent,\" he said. \"Feeling great. I'm doing good, practiced all week and been feeling good all week.\"\n\nThe Jets will likely get a sense of how effective Milliner will be early in the game at MetLife Stadium since it's expected that Josh Freeman and the Bucs offense will test him early.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, very much,\" Milliner said. \"I'm the new guy on the block, so they're going to be out there throwing at me, but I'll be ready for it. I expect it. I want plays like that so I can make plays on the ball.\"", "title": "New York Jets' 1st-Round Pick Dee Milliner Ready For NFL Debut Against Darrelle Revis' Buccaneers", "publishedDate": "2013-09-08T15:23:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKgTk9QmiD4", "description": "Ford F-350 Powerstroke Towing 32' Gooseneck", "title": "F-350 Powerstroke Towing 32' Gooseneck With Backhoe", "publishedDate": "2009-10-31T05:08:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKgccsjmuy8", "description": "This is a video of the Northern Clingfish Gobiesox maeandricus.

Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.\n\nMost back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse.\n\nIf your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days, you should call your health care provider. You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.\n\nTreatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary and alternative treatments, and sometimes surgery.\n\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases", "title": "Back Pain (Backache / Lumbago) - Symptoms and Treatment Options", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T15:44:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BKw9e8rWIDk", "description": "A business applications platform can be architected from the bottom up for sharing of core functions, combined with customization of individual customers' business processes and rigorous protection of each customer's data.

Some of these simple techniques are:\n\n* Switching over to a low-fat diet. Uterine fibroids size has been proven to be directly related to the amount of fatty foods eaten and stored by the body. Hence reduced intake of fatty foods over a period of time will help in fibroid cure.\n\n* Reducing or totally staying away from alcohol. The swelling caused due to regular consumption of alcohol can contribute to increased pain and pressure. Alcohol also has a thinning effect on the blood. Avoiding alcohol will therefore reduce excessive bleeding associated with fibroids.\n\n* Make use of herbs for fibroid treatment. Regular use of certain herbs like motherwort can strengthen the tissues surrounding the uterine wall and reduce bleeding caused due to fibroids.\n\nIf you want to get more information about natural ways to shrink fibroids, please visit http://fibroidsmiracled.com/", "title": "Natural Ways to Shrink Fibroids - Natural Fibroid Treatment", "publishedDate": "2013-06-17T07:42:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "BL7TRTqJeSs", "description": "Learn how to make a plain bow more interesting using different components.

Now to start off with, this little fellow that I have in my hand is actually a king snake, but they are very similar. They are of the same class. They're constrictors. Corn snakes and rat snakes are almost one and the same, and as you can see from the pictures, they have more of a marbled appearance, instead of the colors as the king snake, the California king snake. They come in quite a few different morphs nowadays and you'll get very, very interesting patterns and colors with your corn snakes. \n\nBe careful, the colors come from breeding and inbreeding, genetics, and unfortunately what we're finding is, is the more unique coloring's and morphs have more health problems, so it's very important to talk to the breeder about the quality of the snakes. You want to make sure that your corn snake is active, shiny, round. They should not be concave, nice and clear scales. The eyes, the mouth, the tongue should be moving. The snake should be as inquisitive as this little guy here. \n\nCorn snakes, when they hatch are about 10 to 14 inches long. As adults they could be up to anywhere from 3 to 5 feet, so when you buy your corn snake, be aware number one, they're wonderful snakes, they're docile snakes, but they are going to grow. You want to make sure that the terrarium that you have for your corn snake, most of the time 20 or 30 gallons does it, but an easy way of doing it is measure the length of your snake, and the length and width of your terrarium should be a little bit longer than the length of your snake. So there's a good basic rule on the size of the terrarium.\n\nSnakes are ectothermic, they're cold-blooded. So they need to heat themselves in the warmer area of the terrarium for their immune system to work, for their digestive system to work, and you'll notice that they'll move from the warm area to the cooler area. It's important that for your corn snake, you have either, they have heating ribbons now that you can put underneath of your terrarium, that gives kind of an even heat, and then a heat light that is screened and away from your snake, because they will get close to them and burn themselves. \n\nIt's very important to control humidity. Corn snakes require about 50 to 60% humidity. It's very easily controlled. They need to have a basking area, so putting a tub of water in the terrarium, so they can get into the water, they can drink from it. It keeps them moist, helps with the humidity, helps with them going to the bathroom. \n\nThe other thing for our corn snakes is they are shy, so they always need a hiding spot or a hiding box. An easy thing to do is use a plant pot, turn it upside down, cardboard box, but it needs to be about the size of the snake so it can ball up and be very comfortable in there. You can have a hole in the top or the side, so that they go in to hide away. They are nervous snakes and if they do not have a hiding spot it can be stressful and cause illness.

L'incendie a provoqu\u00e9 la mort de trois personnes de 90, 96 et 100 ans. Le bilan pourrait toutefois s'alourdir, un quatri\u00e8me pensionnaire, en arr\u00eat cardio-respiratoire, se trouve \"en \u00e9tat d'urgence absolue\", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Bruno Charlot, sous-pr\u00e9fet, pr\u00e9sent sur les lieux du sinistre. L'incendie s'est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux environs de 21 heures dans une maison de retraite situ\u00e9e en plein centre de La Terrasse, une localit\u00e9 de 2 500 habitants \u00e0 une trentaine de kilom\u00e8tres de Grenoble.\n\n\u00c0 l'apparition des flammes, plusieurs habitants du village s'\u00e9taient \u00e9galement port\u00e9s spontan\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'aide du personnel de la maison de retraite. Jean-Marc Deutsch, adjoint au maire de La Terrasse, \u00e9voque \"une solidarit\u00e9 extraordinaire qui a permis de limiter les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts\". \"De nombreux jeunes sont rentr\u00e9s dans l'\u00e9tablissement pour commencer \u00e0 \u00e9vacuer les r\u00e9sidents\", a-t-il racont\u00e9.\n\nDelaunay sur place\n\nArriv\u00e9e en fin de matin\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9tablissement, o\u00f9 elle a rencontr\u00e9 le personnel et des r\u00e9sidents, la ministre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e responsable des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es a rendu hommage \u00e0 \"la mobilisation de tous\". \"Cela fait du bien dans ces \u00e9preuves de retrouver cette mobilisation\", soulignant que les faits de ce genre sont peu nombreux\". \"On en a les larmes aux yeux de voir cette solidarit\u00e9 au sein de cette \u00e9quipe, de voir ces jeunes qui ont aid\u00e9 \u00e0 sortir les r\u00e9sidents\", a-t-elle d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 sa sortie de la maison de retraite.\n\nSelon la pr\u00e9fecture de l'Is\u00e8re, le feu serait parti, pour une raison inconnue, de la chambre d'un des r\u00e9sidents de l'\u00e9tablissement. Cette chambre, aux vitres explos\u00e9es et aux murs totalement noircis, \u00e9tait visible depuis la rue du village sur laquelle elle donnait. Pr\u00e9venu par l'alarme d'une chambre, le personnel de l'\u00e9tablissement, qui accueillait 82 pensionnaires pour la plupart tr\u00e8s \u00e2g\u00e9s et pour certains grabataires, selon un m\u00e9decin du Samu, a pu imm\u00e9diatement se porter au secours des r\u00e9sidents et pr\u00e9venir les secours. Le dispositif coupe-feu de l'\u00e9tablissement, construit \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990, a parfaitement fonctionn\u00e9, selon Bruno Charlot, ce qui a permis de limiter la propagation du sinistre.\n\nUn \u00e9tablissement aux normes\n\nMich\u00e8le Delaunay a soulign\u00e9 que la maison de retraite \"r\u00e9pondait aux normes\". \"Les visites des commissions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9taient toujours tr\u00e8s satisfaisantes\", a-t-elle ajout\u00e9 precisant que l'\u00e9tablissement, un ensemble de b\u00e2timents coquets au pied du massif de la Chartreuse, \"avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9habilit\u00e9 en 1998\". Elle a en outre soulign\u00e9 que \"la commission de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 passait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et devait repasser en octobre\". \"Le personnel \u00e9tait en nombre habituel, une infirmi\u00e8re \u00e9tait m\u00eame rest\u00e9e au del\u00e0 de son temps de travail\", a -t-elle pr\u00e9cis\u00e9.

Les autres devaient r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans la nuit un b\u00e2timent de la maison de retraite non touch\u00e9 par les flammes, o\u00f9 une trentaine de r\u00e9sidents avaient pu \u00eatre maintenus durant l'incendie. \"Nous les avons install\u00e9s sur des chaises puis dirig\u00e9s vers la salle communale\", a narr\u00e9 une habitante, qui habite \u00e0 quelques m\u00e8tres de la maison de retraite. \"Certains ne r\u00e9alisaient pas vraiment ce qui se passait, d'autres \u00e9taient plus excit\u00e9s\".

So, I pulled into the center median and as close to the concrete pylon under the center of the bridge as possible.

Nanay Zita received three votes while Rob Sy and JC Tiuseco each got one vote. \n \nNanay Zita becomes the 14th person to be voted out and the sixth member of the Jury, which will choose the first-ever Pinoy Sole Survivor who will win three-million pesos. The eldest Survivor Philippines castaway has now joined Jace Flores, Kiko Rustia, Vern Domingo, Marlon Carmen and Kaye Alipio in the Jury. \n\nNanay Zita was obviously disappointed by her elimination from the game since she really needed the money. She was also visibly hurt by the decision of JC, Rob, and Charis Yacapin to vote her off. \n\n\"Sobra talaga... Hindi talaga dapat gamitin ang puso, utak talaga. Kasi masasaktan ka lang,\" said Nanay Zita in her exit interview. \n\n \n\nNanay Zita voted against JC while Cris Cartagenas, who is safe from the Tribal Council after winning the Immunity Challenge, voted against Rob.\n\nAlthough she is the oldest among the castaways, Nanay Zita is considered  one of the strongest. She has proven that despite her age, she was able to beat her much younger competitors and even win challenges. \n\nIn fact, before being voted out, Nanay Zita won the very emotional Reward Challenge. \n\nDuring this challenge, the five remaining castaways were paired with their loved ones: Zita's son-in-law, JC's girlfriend, Cris's mother, Charis's father, and Rob's brother. The castaways were blindfolded while their loved ones shouted instructions for them to get banners.As a reward, Nanay Zita and her son-in-law will have an overnight stay in Bangkok and see some tourist destinations. Nanay Zita was asked by host Paolo Bediones to pick one castaway and a loved one to join her on their trip. She chose Cris and his mother.\n\n Nanay Zita picked Cris because she believes that among the five remaining castaways, the two of them are the poorest and, therefore, have little chance of traveling abroad.\n\n Nanay Zita was also asked to pick another castaway who will get the chance to bring his/her loved one to their camp.

However, things became more serious in 2005 with the beginning of the recordings of the band's debut album \"Even God Can't Judge Us\", which was released in June 2006 from the Greek label Aldigron Music Productions, receiving very good feedback. Numerous live shows followed.\n\"Even God Can't Judge Us (2006) - 7/10 Metal Hammer (Gr)\"\nSoon after, there was a line up change as Furor replaced their singer, and the band got into the studio once more. In April 2007 they spread a promo-demo CD called \"The God You Need\" receiving positive reviews again and making it as a \"Demo of the Month\" for the greek Metal Hammer.\n\nThe recordings of the second full length album \"Those Chords Made Chaos\" begun in August 2007 and finished in the middle of January 2008.

Tidak hanya menyebar di Pekanbaru, tetapi juga menyebar hingga ke Dumai. Bahkan, rekaman suara Annas Maamun itu telah menjadi bahan tertawaan masyarakat.\n\nDi Dumai, sejak Kamis (17/4/2014) malam hingga Jumat (18/4/2014) siang, kiriman rekaman suara Annas Maamun berkata kotor melalui jaringan sosial, seperti Blackberry Messenger, WhatsApp dan lain-lain terus terjadi. Hampir di setiap kalangan masyarakat, di dalam rumah, warung-warung kopi, kata-kata kotor Annas Maamun itu telah menjadi trending topik.\n\nDiberitakan sebelumnya, Gubernur Riau, Annas Maamun mengeluarkan kata kotor saat ditanya wartawan tentang pengangkatan anak menantu dan keluarganya di pemerintahan Provinsi Riau. Hal itu terjadi saat kunjungannya secara mendadak ke KPU Riau, Kamis (17/4/2014) siang.\n\nAnas mengatakan anak menantunya tersebut mampu melakukan tugas dengan baik. Seperti Dwi Agus Sumarno yang diangkatnya menjadi Kepala Dinas Pendidikan (Disdik) Provinsi Riau baru-baru ini. Ia pun tidak mau dibahas soal politik dinasti yang ditanyakan wartawan.\n\n\"Kalau diangkat kepala dinas pendidikan apa salahnya. Dulu dia kepala IPDN di Rokan Hilir. Jangan dinasti-dinasti lagi, pantek,\" ujar Annas dengan nada tinggi, lalu langsung meninggalkan kantor KPU Riau, dan naik mobil yang sudah menunggunya di luar.\n\nKata pantek di Melayu merupakan ucapan kotor yang tidak layak disebut oleh siapa pun, apalagi seorang gubernur. Sedangkan di Minang, pantek merupakan sebutan kemaluan perempuan yang paling kurang ajar.\n\nTidak hanya kali ini saja Annas Maamun melecehkan wartawan, sejak ia menjadi gubernur, beberapa kali hal ini terjadi, bahkan pemberitaannya juga sampai ke Kompas, dan media-media nasional lainnya.\n\nSebelumnya, Annas Maamun dan Wakil Gubernur Riau, Arsyadjuliandi Rachman secara mendadak mendatangi kantor Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU) Riau, Kamis siang. Kehadiran kedua pejabat tersebut kontan membuat para komisioner KPU Riau terkejut, karena hadir tanpa memberi tahu sebelumnya. Ketika wartawan menanyakan agenda kehadirannya di KPU Riau, Annas mengaku hanya melakukan kunjungan biasa.

Two trumpets, for example, playing the same notes can sound different from one another, and usually do.\n\nTimbre is caused by the fact that each note from a musical instrument is a complex tone containing more than one frequency.  A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration occurring simultaneously.  The vibration that has the slowest rate is called the fundamental frequency and is the loudest.  The other frequencies are either harmonics, overtones, or inharmonics.  The fundamental is the frequency at which the entire wave vibrates.\n\nWe've learned that a musical tone requires three or more harmonics for the ear to identify it.  However, a tone with only three harmonics will not produce high quality timbre that is suitable for high end audio playback.  In our opinion, high end audio playback requires the fundamental plus as many as seven simple harmonics in order to possess dense timbre.\n\nFor a maker of high end audio gear, the goal is always to manufacture audio interfaces, components, or loudspeakers, that will affect the natural harmonic structure of the audio to the smallest degree possible-- thus, retaining the music's natural timbre and realism.  It's a quest we all share. \n\nAt MIT, we've spent the past three decades leading the quest to perfect the science of audio interfacing by applying this centuries-old understanding of music.  We've learned that not only can we keep the fundamental intact; we can keep each one of that fundamental's harmonics and consonant intervals intact as well, preserving the complex harmonic structure of the music.

Thanks to Arborio rice, a particularly starchy rice (usually used in risotto), I've managed to make the creamiest pudding ever -- without eggs or a lot stirring. Oh, and did I mention it's all in one pot? Talk about comfort food!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nTune in to the video to see the pudding practically make itself. I'll show you how to store it so you don't get that (harmless but yicky) layer of skin puddings sometimes get, and I'll teach you how to get the pudding to that perfect consistency.

The rocks rise sheer from a depth of 45m and are exposed to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean making this one of the most hazardous and difficult sites for the building of a lighthouse.\n\nThe rocks around the Scilly Isles caused the wreck of many ships over the years including the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron of the British Fleet in 1707 in which 2,000 men died. The Elder Brethren of Trinity House decided that the lighting of the Scilly Isles, which at that time consisted of only the old lighthouse at St. Agnes, was inadequate, and resolved to build a lighthouse on the most westerly danger, the Bishop Rock.\n\nJames Walker, Engineer in Chief to Trinity House, was against building a solid granite tower arguing that the rock ledge was too small and the elements too powerful, being exposed as it was to the full force of the Atlantic ocean. Walker demonstrated that the wind pressures at times exceeded 7,000 lb per sq.ft, and as many as 30 gales a year were not unusual in the area.\n\nThus in 1847, it was decided to erect a screw-pile lighthouse at a cost of \u00a312,000. The first task was to sink cast iron legs into the solid granite, braced and stayed with wrought iron rods. The designer maintained that the waves would be able to roll freely among the piles instead of being obstructed by the solid mass of masonry tower. When work was suspended at the end of 1849 the building was complete all but the installation of the lighting apparatus. Before it could be completed the following season, a heavy gale swept away the whole structure on the evening of 5th February 1850.\n\nUndismayed by the failure of the first lighthouse, James Walker once again turned to the idea of a granite tower based upon Smeaton's Eddystone. After surveying the site, he finally chose a small but solid mass giving room for a base 10m in diameter. The surface waves constantly swept over the site, and indeed the lowest blocks had to be laid a third of a metre beneath low water mark. A heavy coffer dam was erected around the site and the water within pumped out, so that the masons might be able to work on a dry rock face. Each granite block, weighing from one to two tons, was set into its preselected position, and each course dovetailed and keyed into position at the sides, top and the bottom thus forming an immovable mass. The workmen were housed on a small nearby uninhabited islet, where living quarters and workshops were erected. The men were carried to and from the site as the weather permitted. Working spells were brief, as well as being few and far between, and after seven years labour the tower was finally completed. All the granite was despatched from the mainland to the island depot where it was shaped and numbered before being sent to the rock. In all the 35 m tower contained 2,500 tons of dressed granite and cost \u00a334,560. The light was first exhibited on 1st September 1858. During one particularly powerful storm, waves rolled up on the side of the lighthouse and tore away the 550lb fog bell from its fastenings on the gallery.\n\nIn 1881 Sir James Douglass made a detailed inspection of the tower and reported extensive damage and weakness in the structure. It was decided to strengthen the tower and at the same time to increase the elevation of the light by 12m. The plans, though quite complex in nature essentially entailed the building of a new lighthouse around the old one, completely encasing it. The real weakness was the foundation and this Douglass proposed to strengthen and enlarge with massive blocks of granite sunk into the rock and held there by heavy bolts. It was an enormous cylindrical base, providing the lighthouse with an excellent buffer onto which the force of the waves could be spent before hitting the tower itself. The masonry casing, averaging a metre in thickness, was carried up as far as the new masonry required for the increased height of the light. The weight of the additional granite was 3,200 tons, making a total weight of 5,700 tons. Work was completed in October 1887 at a cost of \u00a366,000.\n\nBishop Rock was converted to automatic operation during 1991 with the last keepers leaving the lighthouse on 21 December 1992.\n\nThe fog signal was discontinued on 13 June 2007.\n\nFilmed September 2013\n\nVideo Produced by Paul Dinning - Wildlife in Cornwall", "title": "Bishop Rock Lighthouse Isles of Scilly", "publishedDate": "2013-09-08T09:52:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "BLrIuS81ZYs", "description": "Our debut release, thanks to Hidden Vibes Netlabel! :-)\n\nhttp://hiddenvibes.bandcamp.com/album/intersection\n\nhttp://hidden-vibes.blogspot.be/2012/10/myosotis-intersection.html\n\nwww.last.fm/music/Myosotis/Intersection\n\n=====================\nMyosotis - Intersection\n\nMyosotis is an ambient duo from the Netherlands.

The original idea came about ten years back to Swiss armourer Vivian Mueller, who at the time experienced cutting and welding together multiple parts of the famous Sig P210: the result was a long slide, double barrel 9mm, highly decorated collector piece, which indeed shot very well.\n\nOur idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready double barrel .45 caliber pistol.\nWe achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining.\n\nThe gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16\nbullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25.\n\nThe stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds.\n\nThe AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.\n\nThe AF2011-A1 (\"Twenty Eleven\" for aficionados) can be ordered either with 2 independent triggers and one sear group (left or right, with user-interchangeability for right or left operations) or with 2 triggers permanently joined and the choice of 1 or 2 sear groups.\nThe AF2011-A1 is available in mirror finish Deep Blue or with a 3400 Vickers surface hardness White Ash Nitrite coating.\n\nMore info at www.arsenalfirearms.com", "title": "AF2011-A1 \"Second Century\" - Double barrel pistol", "publishedDate": "2012-03-09T15:02:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "BM-Pl4Jz19Y", "description": "Duluth, MN, Lake Superior, December 2013.

Brain injury can be caused by an external physical force (also known as traumatic brain injury, or TBI); rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head; bleeding within or around the brain; lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain; or toxic substances passing through the blood-brain barrier. \n\nBrain injury results in temporary or permanent impairment of cognitive, emotional, and/or physical functioning.\n\nCerebral palsy refers to a motor deficit that usually manifests itself by 2 years of age and is secondary to an abnormality of at least the part of the brain that relates to motor function. \n\nStroke refers to a sudden interruption of the blood supply to the brain, usually caused by a blocked artery or a ruptured blood vessel, leading to an interruption of homeostasis of cells, and symptoms such as loss of speech and loss of motor function.\n\nWhile these conditions have different etiologies, prognostic factors, and outcomes, they also have important similarities. Each condition represents a broad spectrum, from barely perceptible or mild disabilities to devastating ones. \n\nAll three are characterized by acute and chronic phases and by changes over time in the type and degree of disability. Another similarity is that the outcome of conventional treatment is often unsatisfactory. For brain injury in particular, there is a strong sense that conventional treatment has made little impact on outcomes.\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nQueanbeyan,  Australia\nFort Wayne, Indiana\nChad, N'Djamena\nGladstone, Queensland,\nBurbank, California\nSolomon Islands, Honiara\nIran, Teheran\nJamaica, Kingston\nRedcliffe, Queensland\n\nhttp://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/hyperbaric-chamber.html\nhttp://www.balancedhealthtoday.com/Hyperbairc-Oxygen-Therapy-Autism.html", "title": "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for the Treatment of Stroke Part 1", "publishedDate": "2010-01-30T09:28:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMLU-qrjO90", "description": "Segundo exemplar do novo Corvette a chegar no Brasil e o primeiro de SP.\nCurta: facebook.com/FlagrasEmSaoPaulo", "title": "2014 Chevrolet C7 Corvette Stingray no Brasil", "publishedDate": "2013-12-21T21:42:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMLcKCn5fdI", "description": "One-second Folding bikeAmazing Folding bike", "title": "Amazing Folding bike", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T00:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMLdHVaHgIY", "description": "", "title": "Supergrass -  Pumping On Your Stereo - Glastonbury 2004", "publishedDate": "2009-12-11T00:55:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMLlA0prc6I", "description": "Duosat Troy Hd Configura\u00e7\u00e3o Atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o Passo A Passo,Mais Abaixo Na Descri\u00e7\u00e3o Voc\u00ea Encontra A \u00f9ltima Atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o Duosat Troy Hd \nhttp://parceirosdosdecos.com/2014/06/duosat-troy-hd-atualizacao-junho-2014/\n\nCURTA NOSSAS FANPAGES NO FACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PortalParceirosDosDecos\nhttps://www.facebook.com/forumazboxazamerica", "title": "Duosat Troy Hd Configura\u00e7\u00e3o Instala\u00e7\u00e3o Passo A Passo", "publishedDate": "2013-11-03T18:32:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMLlIfumy1E", "description": "Luke Mockridge wollte mal was anderes sehen: Mallorca.

Unlike other Gars, the mature Alligator Gar possesses a dual row of large teeth in the upper jaw. Its name derives from the alligator-like appearance of these teeth along with the fish's elongated snout. The dorsal surface of the Alligator Gar is a brown or olive color, while the ventral surface tends to be lighter. Their scales are diamond-shaped and interlocking (ganoid) and are sometimes used by Native Americans for jewelry and arrow heads.\n\nAlong with its status as the largest species of Gar, the Alligator Gar is the largest exclusively freshwater fish found in North America, measuring 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) and weighing at least 200 lb (91 kg) at maturity. The largest Alligator Gar caught by net was caught by Kenny Williams, from Vicksburg, Mississippi, in February 2011,[1] and measured 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m) long, 327 lb (148 kg) in weight, and nearly 48 in (120 cm) around. The fish is believed to have been between 50 and 70 years old, wildlife officials said. Williams has donated the fish to the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science in Jackson where it will be on permanent display in the future. The current world record for the largest Alligator Gar caught on rod and reel is 279 lb (127 kg).[Note 1][2] The largest taken by bowfishing is 365 lb (166 kg).[Note 2][3] The fish is also known for its ability to survive outside the water, being able to last for up to two hours above the surface.\nAlligator Gar are found in the Lower Mississippi River Valley and Gulf Coast states of the Southern United States and Mexico as far south as Veracruz, encompassing the following US states: Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Florida, and Georgia.[4] They have also been known historically to come as far north as central Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, and west-central Illinois, where the most northerly verified catch was at Meredosia, Illinois in 1922 and an 8.5 ft (2.6 m) specimen, now preserved, was caught at nearby Beardstown.[5] Specimens at locations further south in Illinois have been verified as recently as 1976, with the Illinois Academy of Sciences verifying a total of 122 captures to that date.[5] They inhabit sluggish pools and backwaters or large rivers, bayous, and lakes. They are found in fresh, brackish and saltwater, and are more adaptable to the latter than other gars.
