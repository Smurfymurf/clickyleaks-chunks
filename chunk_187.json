Adult and nymph ticks have eight legs while larval and seed ticks only have six. Females also have a distinctive white shield near the head and front of the body; males have no distinctive shield but are covered in a mottled gray pattern.\nThe Rocky Mountain wood tick is a 3-host life-cycle tick, seeking a new host every one to three years. Ticks hatch in the spring and seek meals from small rodents like mice and chipmunks. As they develop into larger nymphs they seek larger hosts like rabbits and skunks. Nymph ticks that fail to find a host will hibernate during the winter; adult ticks also hibernate during the cold season, but with a low survival rate of ten percent. Ticks feed for approximately a week before mating; a female can grow from 5 mg to 700 mg when engorged and lays several thousands eggs before dying.\nRocky Mountain wood ticks are the primary carriers of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is the worse of tick-borne diseases. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by fever, nausea, emesis, severe headache, muscle pain, and a lack of appetite occurring within one to fourteen days after the bite. If left untreated, the disease progress into skin rashes, abdominal pain, and joint pain; the worse symptoms include partial paralysis of the extremities, gangrene, hearing loss, and movement and language disorders", "title": "Attack of the Giant Tick", "publishedDate": "2009-04-28T00:29:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnQx8onJjAA", "description": "Facebook Fans: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamster-Productions/201557413189232\nA remake of my pretty bad remake of Neil Cicierega's Mysterious Ticking Noise.\n Enjoy!\n\nOriginal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4", "title": "Lego Potter Puppet Pals: The Mysterious Ticking Noise", "publishedDate": "2011-08-02T06:38:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnRAbKQk2yA", "description": "http://devkhalsa.com/essential-oils/benefits-of-peppermint-essential-oil/\nPeppermint oil is one of my very favourite essential oils.

Water monitors are one of the most common monitor lizards found throughout Asia, and range from Sri Lanka, India, Indochina, the Malay Peninsula and various islands of Indonesia, living in areas close to water.\n\nThe water monitor is a large species of monitor lizard. Breeding maturity is attained for males when they are a relatively modest 40 cm (16 in) and weigh 1 kg (2.2 lb) and for females at 50 cm (20 in). However, they grow much larger throughout life, with males being larger than females. Most adult specimens will not exceed 1.5--2 m (4.9--6.6 ft) in length. However, the species can attain a maximum size of 3 m (9.8 ft). The largest specimen on record was an animal measuring 321 cm from Ceylon (Sri Lanka). A common mature weight of Varanus salvator can be 19.5 kg (43 lb). The maximum weight of the species is over 50 kg (110 lb). In exceptional cases, the species has been reported to attain 75 to 90 kg (170 to 200 lb), though most such reports are unverified and may be unreliable. They are the world's second heaviest lizard, after the Komodo dragon. Their body is muscular with a long, powerful, laterally compressed tail.\n\nThe generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic waral (\u0648\u0631\u0644), which translates as \"monitor\" in English. The specific name is the Latin word for \"Saviour\" denoting a possible religious connotation. The Water monitor is occasionally confused with the Crocodile monitor (V. salvadorii) because of their similar scientific names.\n\nIn Indonesian and Malay, the water monitor is called 'biawak'.\n\nAsian water monitor, Varanus salvator salvator the nominate subspecies is now restricted to Sri Lanka where it is known as the Kabaragoya in Sinhala, and Udumbu in Tamil.\n\nAndaman Islands water monitor, Varanus salvator andamanensis: Andaman Islands; Type locality: Port Blair, Andaman Islands.\n\nTwo-striped water monitor, Varanus salvator bivittatus: Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Ombai (Alor), Wetar and some neighbouring islands within the Sunda arch, Indonesia; Type locality: Java (designated by Mertens 1959).\n\nWater monitors can be defensive, using their tail, claws, and jaws when fighting. They are excellent swimmers, using the raised fin located on their tails to steer through water. Water monitors are carnivores, and have a wide range of foods. They are known to eat fish, frogs, rodents, birds, crabs, and snakes. They have also been known to eat turtles, as well as young crocodiles and crocodile eggs. Like the Komodo Dragon, they will often eat carrion. Water monitors have been observed eating catfish in a fashion similar to a mammalian carnivore, tearing off chunks of meat with its sharp teeth while holding it with its forelegs and then separating different parts of the fish for sequential consumption", "title": "Asian Water Monitor - Varanus salvator - Reptile - Lizard - Reptiles - Lizards", "publishedDate": "2013-06-30T21:02:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnXcvJ5OzkE", "description": "All public service announcements should be sarcastic.\n\nCreated By Rachel Laforest and Katie Marovitch", "title": "Women To Men: Please Catcall Us (PSA)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T16:00:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnXwl52epq0", "description": "Badhasaabka G.Salal Oo Hawlo Shaqo Ku jooga Borama Ayaa saxafada Uga Waramay Xalada Guud ee G.Salal iyo Colaado Deegaanka Ka Jirey oo Uu sheegay In La Soo Afjaray..", "title": "Badhasaabka G.Salal Oo Hawlo Shaqo Ku jooga Borama", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T14:34:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnYd19BbQAA", "description": "Hearthstone Season 2, Day 2 after reset", "title": "Miracle Rogue", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T17:45:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnYoB5tR9gk", "description": "Like this video if you enjoyed it.

The Philharmonic re-released that performance on an LP of historical highlights for fundraising purposes, but an archivist at Lincoln Center told me the other early performances, such as this one, have never been re-released.\nThis disc, Columbia A6070, was produced at the Philharmonic's second recording session, February 1918, and is sequentially the seventh by the Orchestra.  The 'Waltz Of The Flowers' heard here is possibly the first performance of music from Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker' to be recorded by a major symphony orchestra.  Although acoustic, and subjected to approximately 90 years' play, the sound is remarkable; listen especially to the harp solo passage near the start.\nThe then Music Director of the Philharmonic, and conductor here, Josef Stransky (photo) was not highly regarded (see the Wikipedia article); but Mahler was a tough act to follow.  Nonetheless, Stransky deserves credit for expanding the capacity of Carnegie Hall to accommodate many more than could be seated-- he was responsible for the Philharmonic's initial recordings, and, in 1922, for the initial radio broadcasts-- bringing concerts to millions.\nI have deliberately included the sounds made by placing the needle on the rim of the disc and gently pushing it into the grooves, and the capture of the needle in the locked groove at the end until manually removed, for the benefit of the CD Generation-- the only servo-mechanism once available for playing 78-RPM discs was the human hand.", "title": "New York Philharmonic 1918 -- Waltz Of The Flowers", "publishedDate": "2008-12-12T18:36:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "AngFlaXm_aQ", "description": "Like \"Red-tails in Love\", the wonderful true account by Marie Winn; Ernie Sarro is following the lives of two Red-tailed Hawks, Buzz and Ruby, who raise their offspring on a 7th floor ledge of a building in Cambridge, Mass.

Cette \u00e9tude, dont certains extraits viennent d'\u00eatre publi\u00e9s dans la presse allemande, exprime parfaitement bien ce que les militants de la cause animale repr\u00e9sentent pour les institutions europ\u00e9ennes: des activistes qualifi\u00e9s de \" criminels itin\u00e9rants\"! D\u00e9fendre les droits des animaux est donc per\u00e7u par l'UE comme une action criminelle que la loi doit punir pour \u00e9viter sa prolif\u00e9ration.\n\nCette expression de \" criminels itin\u00e9rants \" est explicitement utilis\u00e9e dans cette \u00e9tude qui annonce le pire en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9pression \u00e0 l'encontre des militants des droits des animaux. L'UE va donc dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir criminaliser le mouvement de d\u00e9fense des animaux en se servant de tous les moyens r\u00e9pressifs dont elle dispose au risque de mettre en question les libert\u00e9s individuelles et publiques et ce dans le but de privil\u00e9gier et d\u00e9fendre par tous les moyens les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9conomiques des entreprises qui exploitent et qui vivent de cette exploitation scandaleuse des animaux.\n\nL'UE prend donc partie clairement pour ceux qui se servent des animaux comme biens \u00e9conomiques et donc se range du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du capitalisme le plus violent. C'est la d\u00e9mocratie elle-m\u00eame qui sera mise en question avec une telle loi qui interdira tout rassemblement visant \u00e0 d\u00e9noncer telle ou telle entreprise ou institution violant ouvertement les int\u00e9r\u00eats des animaux et leurs droits \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre maltrait\u00e9s et exploit\u00e9s.\n\nL'Europe est donc en train de tuer l'id\u00e9e m\u00eame de d\u00e9mocratie et de libert\u00e9 d'expression qui constituaient l'une de ses fiert\u00e9s. Nous savons maintenant que les grandes institutions, nationales et internationales, \u00e0 savoir les institutions politiques, judiciaires, scientifiques et \u00e9conomiques sont les principaux obstacles \u00e0 un r\u00e9el changement dans la domaine des droits des animaux, ce projet de loi le prouve amplement et nous devons d\u00e9noncer le fait que l'Europe, de moins en moins d\u00e9mocratique, envisage dans le secret cette restriction inadmissible des libert\u00e9s individuelles, publiques et de la libert\u00e9 d'expression.\n\nLes militants de la cause animale, qui font donc peur \u00e0 l'Europe manifestement, sont et seront de plus en plus surveill\u00e9s, d\u00e9non\u00e7ons cette surveillance indigne d'Etats d\u00e9mocratiques. C'est la d\u00e9mocratie qui est en danger avec ce projet de loi qui vise \u00e0 interdire notre libert\u00e9 de d\u00e9placement sur le territoire europ\u00e9en.

Also read how to cure eczema naturally with proven home remedies. Learn how to cure eczema or dermatitis using natural remedies, lifestyle and diet. There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Eczema Remedy - 10 Top Remedies to Put an End to Your Suffering", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T11:03:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ann3B52tq9o", "description": "2013 version : https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=gzxCXnBhZw8\n2014 version ; http://youtu.be/7MCRauZ22rw\n$39.55 USD on amazon.com ; http://amzn.to/1vnXvIe\n\u00a333.89 GBP on amazon.co.uk : http://amzn.to/1rIG3ru", "title": "My Best Top 6 TONKA Toys inc GARBAGE TRUCK, POLICE CAR, AMBULANCE, CHERRY PICKER and TOW TRUCK", "publishedDate": "2012-10-28T19:02:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnnSHXZuI8A", "description": "Eindtune van de Japanse tekenfilmserie zoals in Nederland uitgezonden door de KRO van 1979 tot 1981.\n\nEnd tune of the Japanese animated series as broadcasted in the Netherlands by KRO television from 1979 until 1981.", "title": "Sindbad de Zeeman [eindtune]", "publishedDate": "2011-06-25T12:23:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "Annw288Lrrk", "description": "Directed by Michael Mallicote\nfrom the album \"The Kids are Gone\"\ncoming March 2014", "title": "Matt Butcher and The Schoolyard Band - \"Maggie\"", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T23:55:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnnzJTs4GWI", "description": "A beautiful addition to any kids room and easily made with scrap material!\nSee the written tutorial steps here: http://tinyurl.com/kmgrtw2\n_________________________________________________________\n\nMUSIC: (Royalty Free)\n'Super Friendly' Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\nISRC: USUAN1100825 \u00a9 2011 Kevin MacLeod\n_________________________________________________________\n\nWHERE ELSE TO FIND ME:\n\nStyleNovice\nBlog: http://tinyurl.com/nyzwxdp\nFacebook: http://tinyurl.com/kde8lhj\nTwitter: http://tinyurl.com/kutvpn2\n\nBoutiqueTreats\nYouTube Recipe Channel: http://tinyurl.com/kocbkqv\nFacebook: http://tinyurl.com/ltxo8ty\nTwitter: http://tinyurl.com/la864wf\nRecipe Blog: http://tinyurl.com/k2z8w88\n\nFor collaborations and business inquiries, please contact via Channel Pages: http://ChannelPages.com/StyleNovice", "title": "{Step by Step Sewing} DIY Fabric Bunting", "publishedDate": "2014-01-08T18:00:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnoDGJWuDjk", "description": "Aldo canta \"La battaglia di Magenta\" ma ha qualche problema a farla senza tronco...

Twelve years ago, that future hung in the balance.  \"I went from being perfectly healthy to status 1A on the liver transplant list,\" she says. Status 1A is as serious as it gets. It started with what Bonn describes as mild flu-like symptoms. Within a month and without explanation, she went from active pre-teen to severely lethargic, edematous, jaundiced liver transplant candidate. When Bonn entered Cincinnati Children's Liver Care Center and the care of William Balistreri, MD, doctors knew she would last little more than a week without a new liver. She went to the top of the transplant list and fortune smiled on her: a liver became available. Over the next few years, Bonn battled bouts of rejection, a 50-pound weight gain from steroids, and all the attendant issues that go with receiving a transplanted organ. Even though she hasn't had a rejection episode in nearly 10 years, Bonn still takes daily immunosuppressive medication. She will be the first to tell you it is all worth it. But now, as a medical student with plans to become a gastroenterologist, her dream is to find a better way.", "title": "Tell Me a Story: Liver Transplant Patient Becomes a Determined Medical Student", "publishedDate": "2012-09-05T13:22:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "AnqkitvQ_qU", "description": "Buy this puzzle here: http://bit.ly/13gX7Jk\n\nSubscribe: http://youtube.com/subscribe_widget?p=chareaves\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thetwistypuzzler\nBlogger: http://twistypuzzling.blogspot.com\n\nPlease click LIKE as it's a huge encouragement to me to keep making these videos.

Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a well-meaning but not especially bright fellow with a gift for making the worst of any situation. Bean is about to be fired from his job as a guard at the Royal Nation Art Gallery for sleeping on the job, but the Chairman (John Mills) intervenes at the last moment. To insure that his incompetence will manifest itself so completely that there will be no choice but to get rid of him, Bean's superiors come up with a plan -- they'll send him to America to speak at a posh private gallery owned by George Grierson (Harris Yulin), where General Newton (Burt Reynolds) will display the most recent addition to his art collection, \"Whistler's Mother.\" It's even money whether or not the museum will still be standing before Bean is done; as if this weren't enough, while in L.A. Bean is mistaken for a surgeon and forced to operate on an injured police officer. Richard Curtis, one of the film's producers, said after viewing the final product, \"It's an unpleasant family movie.

Dizzle\n\nHailing from London, but with ties in Surrey (and a little village called Bildeston), Passport To Stockholm have just announced their debut single \u2018Imperfections\u2019, with a launch show planned for 16 September, at the Barfly, London.\n\n\u2018Imperfections\u2019 is the follow up to the band\u2019s \u2018Chemistry EP\u2019, which saw love and acclaim from the likes of BBC 6 Music, Amazing Radio and many more, towards the tail end of last year.\n\nThe \u2018Chemistry EP\u2019 was funded purely by the band\u2019s loyal fan base through a Pledge Music campaign, reaching their funding target in just two short days.\n\nThis new single stands as an honest and triumphant step in to the limelight, candidly portraying the idea that it\u2019s people\u2019s imperfections that define us all as individuals, and that without these flaws, the world would be a far blander place to be.\n\nVocalist Barny, and guitarist Tom have been working on material together since the tender age of 14, but it wasn\u2019t until last year the band\u2019s line up was complete, adding the skills of cellist Sophie English, and percussionist Henri Grimes.\n\nThe addition of these final two members, has allowed the band to hone their sound, and with \u2018Imperfections\u2019 they\u2019ve crafted a near perfect acoustic indie-folk track. The gorgeous strings snake in and out of the lively rhythm section, with Barnard\u2019s warm vocals acting as the perfect compliment to the expertly produced instrumentals.\n\nThe band have been working with acclaimed producers Gordon Mills Jr and Amy Wadge, who collectively have produced and helped write records for Lissie, Ed Sheeran, Newton Faulkner and Lewis Watson to name a few. Additionally, the quartet have been working closely with Carey Willets, of Athlete fame, whom they have built a strong bond with during the production and writing process.\n\nWith a whole host of very well received festival performances already under their belt, and more booked for the remainder of the summer, the future looks very bright for Passport To Stockholm.\n\nTheir music is one that captivates the listener from the offset, a compelling combination of thought provoking lyrics, acoustic-folk infused instrumentals, and a heart of gold.\n\nPassport To Stockholm are: Barny Barnard, Tom Piggott, Sophie English, Henri Grimes.", "title": "Passport To Stockholm - Imperfections (Official video)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T13:47:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ao-R_hxKfPk", "description": "Otra versi\u00f3n de este maravilloso tema que le canta a aquel amor que nunca se olvida, que mantiene vivo su recuerdo y que mantiene viva su presencia en todas partes llenando el alma de nostalgia y amargura.", "title": "EL DOLOR DE LA AUSENCIA  Dueto Calamary", "publishedDate": "2014-05-11T23:19:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ao-nGmQJTxk", "description": "Bij het ROC van Amsterdam, Luchtvaartdienstverlening kun je de opleiding Steward/Stewardess volgen.

Extant jawed vertebrates are so different from jawless ones (lampreys and hagfishes) that it is hard to see how this might have come about. Studies on a very primitive jawed vertebrate \u2014 the fossil placoderm fish Romundina \u2014 provide a glimpse of how that transition could have occurred. Vincent Dupret et al. show that the head of Romundina combines jawed vertebrate architecture with cranial and cerebral proportions resembling those of extant jawless vertebrates such as lampreys and some fossil jawless fishes. This combination appears to be primitive for jawed vertebrates and differs fundamentally from the morphology of sharks, traditionally used as a model for a generalized jawed vertebrate.\n\nAbstract \nExtant vertebrates form two clades, the jawless Cyclostomata (lampreys and hagfishes) and the jawed Gnathostomata (all other vertebrates), with contrasting facial architectures. These arise during development from just a few key differences in the growth patterns of the cranial primordia: notably, the nasal sacs and hypophysis originate from a single placode in cyclostomes but from separate placodes in gnathostomes, and infraoptic ectomesenchyme migrates forward either side of the single placode in cyclostomes but between the placodes in gnathostomes. Fossil stem gnathostomes preserve cranial anatomies rich in landmarks that provide proxies for developmental processes and allow the transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates to be broken down into evolutionary steps. Here we use propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography to image the cranial anatomy of the primitive placoderm (jawed stem gnathostome) Romundina, and show that it combines jawed vertebrate architecture with cranial and cerebral proportions resembling those of cyclostomes and the galeaspid (jawless stem gnathostome) Shuyu. This combination seems to be primitive for jawed vertebrates, and suggests a decoupling between ectomesenchymal growth trajectory, ectomesenchymal proliferation, and cerebral shape change during the origin of gnathostomes.", "title": "Origin of the Jawed Vertebrate Face", "publishedDate": "2014-11-07T00:02:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AoXcNqM_VbA", "description": "a bluebelly lizard that i caught eats an earwig", "title": "bluebelly lizard eats an earwig", "publishedDate": "2011-06-18T18:37:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AoXi9U1CDEw", "description": "", "title": "Maximum Tune 4 Fukuoka King", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T13:15:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "AoYW0_TCZGg", "description": "I sometimes wonder if other people cannot resist to buy sweet potatoes just like me.

The message was clear and adopted by all: we all have a role to play in making a difference.

Using his great style of modern filmmaking and astounding music and effects, he has created some of the best films of all time. I was never ever disappointed by one of his films.

Since integration (antidifferentiation) and differentiation are inverse operations, we see many of the same patterns in integrals that we do with derivatives. Professor Burger will show you how to recognize integral problems that you may be able to solve by untangling the chain rule.\n\nTaught by Professor Edward Burger, this lesson was selected from a broader, comprehensive course, College Algebra. \n\nEdward Burger, Professor of Mathematics at Williams College, earned his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin, having graduated summa cum laude with distinction in mathematics from Connecticut College.\n\nHe has also taught at UT-Austin and the University of Colorado at Boulder, and he served as a fellow at the University of Waterloo in Canada and at Macquarie University in Australia. Prof. Burger has won many awards, including the 2001 Haimo Award for Distinguished Teaching of Mathematics, the 2004 Chauvenet Prize, and the 2006 Lester R. Ford Award, all from the Mathematical Association of America. In 2006, Reader's Digest named him in the \"100 Best of America\".\n\nProf. Burger is the author of over 50 articles, videos, and books, including the trade book, Coincidences, Chaos, and All That Math Jazz: Making Light of Weighty Ideas and of the textbook The Heart of Mathematics: An Invitation to Effective Thinking. He also speaks frequently to professional and public audiences, referees professional journals, and publishes articles in leading math journals, including The Journal of Number Theory and American Mathematical Monthly. His areas of specialty include number theory, Diophantine approximation, p-adic analysis, the geometry of numbers, and the theory of continued fractions.\n\nProf. Burger's unique sense of humor and his teaching expertise combine to make him the ideal presenter of Thinkwell's entertaining and informative video lectures.", "title": "Calculus: Undoing the Chain Rule", "publishedDate": "2009-07-29T05:49:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "AonJRhr08qA", "description": "Pramendra Singh Bundela, member of the TISA Delhi Self-help Group, self-advertises his stammer on the Delhi Metro.

The Dimasa people (or Dima-basa, and also called Dimasa-Kachari) are a group of people in Assam, in northeastern India. Dimasa mythology says they are the children of Bangla Raja and the great divine bird Arikhidima. Bangla Raja's six sons\u2014Sibrai, Doo Raja, Naikhu Raja, Waa Raja, Gunyung Brai Yung, and Hamyadao\u2014and Arikhidima are their ancestors, and in Dimasa belief, are ancestral Gods. They are called Madai in Dimasa. Evil spirits born of the seven eggs of Arikhidima are responsible for disease, suffering and natural calamities.\n\nAncient Dimasa tradition maintains that sixty thousand moons (Lunar months) ago, they left their ancestral land when it suffered a severe drought. After a long wandering, they settled at Di-laobra Sangibra, the confluence of the Brahmaputra and Sangi or Di-tsang. There they held a great assembly. The place is the present West Bengal area where the River Ganges and the Brahmaputra join, and where the Kacharis established their first Seat. Over time, their kingdom over large territories.\n\nThe Dimasa are part of the greater Kachari group\u2014one of the ancient Kachari tribes. They live mostly in the northern half of the Dima Hasao District, an administrative district of the Indian state of Assam that includes the ravines of the Jatinga valley and adjoining land. The name 'Dimasa' most probably stands for \"children of the big river,\" referring to earstwhile on the seashore or on the bank of big river. Kacharis appear to be one of the earliest indigenous ethnic groups of north eastern India. Most independent tribal communities in this region are of Kachari origin. The Boro, Rabha, Sonowal, Thengal, Dimasa, Garo, Hajong, Deori, Sutiya, Tiwa or Lalung, Hojai, Barman of Kachar, Trippra, Mech, Rukkini Barman of Hailakandi and Karimganj etc. are all of Kachari origin.\n\nDimasa Kachari are mainly found in the present-day Dima Hasao District (Old name \"North Cachar Hills\") of Assam. They also have a sizable population in Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Nowgong and Karimganj Districts of the Assam State and also Dimapur region of Nagaland state. In Cachar,following the formal conversion of their king Krishna Chandra Hasnusa to Hinduism general Dimasa have largely adopted Hinduism. These new converts to Hinduism are called Barman of Cachar. On the other hand in Nowgong District the Dimasa have come under the influence of Assamese Vishnavism,and there they are called Hojai Kachari (Hojai is also a name of a Dimasa male clan. This term is also stands for the priest). In Dima Hasao district, a section of the Dimasa called Semsas is confined within the historical village named Semkhor,they eventually developed a distinct dialect. Similar minor distinction exists within the Dimasa based on the region they inhabit like Hawarsa, Dembrasa, Hamrisa, Dijuwasa and Hasaosa and Walgongsa.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

Este es uno de los lemas m\u00e1s recurrentes que ha dejado la crisis reciente. Cambiar radicalmente para comenzar una nueva vida de posibilidades abiertas. Una idea de considerable ambivalencia, como casi todos los lemas transformados en or\u00e1culo: es la respuesta a una pregunta com\u00fan y actual, \u201c\u00bfqu\u00e9 hago yo ahora?\u201d, que l\u00f3gicamente se formula con ambig\u00fcedad oracular: por un lado, una sana invitaci\u00f3n a la transformaci\u00f3n individual, a tomar las riendas de nuestro destino frente a la debacle del contexto. Por otro, cualquier cambio individual motivado por la necesidad termina por esconder cierta violencia social: es no tanto una invitaci\u00f3n como una imposici\u00f3n. Una oportunidad de oro de regeneraci\u00f3n voluntaria transformada en \u00fanica posibilidad de supervivencia. \n\n Con \u201c\u00a1Buena Suerte!\u201d, Ruth G\u00f3mez alude a esta necesidad actual de reinventarnos para no rendirnos, de cambiar para superar la inacci\u00f3n o el temor, trazando un arco metaf\u00f3rico entre realidad social humana y la regeneraci\u00f3n y resistencia biol\u00f3gicas. Su visi\u00f3n es optimista: no s\u00f3lo por las formas empleadas, su cuidado y personal estilo en el que entremezcla hiperrealismo, pop y la idealizaci\u00f3n colorista del anim\u00e9 japon\u00e9s. La artista nos da \u00e1nimos para que observemos el cambio, impuesto o voluntario, como una apuesta vital hacia un nuevo comienzo, donde se convoca a la suerte como compa\u00f1era de viaje ideal. La regeneraci\u00f3n es la capacidad que poseen algunos seres vivos, animales y vegetales, de reactivar su desarrollo para restaurar tejidos faltantes. Es la cualidad que permite a la lagartija recomponer su cola si la pierde, o a cierto tipo de medusas tener una vida infinita e ilimitada, renovando todo su ser, todas sus c\u00e9lulas, cada cierto tiempo. La resistencia es la capacidad para hacer frente a ataques de agentes bi\u00f3ticos o abi\u00f3ticos: desde plagas y par\u00e1sitos a cambios ambientales extremos. A veces se asocia a la hibernaci\u00f3n: a resistir para revivir en circunstancias m\u00e1s adecuadas. Aqu\u00ed aparece incluida como un s\u00edntoma o un estadio del que partir hacia el cambio deseado. \n\n Se ha dicho, y con toda la raz\u00f3n, que el trabajo de Ruth G\u00f3mez habla siempre de las relaciones entre los individuos. La singularidad espec\u00edfica de su trabajo art\u00edstico viene dada por c\u00f3mo aborda esto: primero, por su car\u00e1cter de met\u00e1fora construida en la comparaci\u00f3n entre lo humano y lo animal. Segundo, por su forma de acercamiento a lo sociopol\u00edtico: no desde una l\u00f3gica vinculada al an\u00e1lisis racional de los hechos, sino desde un punto de vista abiertamente emocional. Lo que realmente parece interesar a Ruth G\u00f3mez es la empat\u00eda como motor del cambio individual y social. Ella misma se reconoce m\u00e1s como artista social que pol\u00edtica. Tercero: por el car\u00e1cter at\u00e1vico, primigenio, de las coreograf\u00edas que aplica a esos seres inmersos en sus relaciones: en sus trabajos previos se rastrea la posibilidad de establecer grupo y comunidad, tambi\u00e9n la resistencia y lucha, igualmente el ocultamiento y la huida. Ahora parece sugerir un ilusorio, po\u00e9tico, cambio evolutivo. Hechos referenciales de la conformaci\u00f3n de lo humano en los albores de la historia, cuando las circunstancias eran particularmente adversas. \n\n Si los primeros trabajos de Ruth G\u00f3mez animalizaban al individuo para mostrar actitudes alienadas, en sus \u00faltimos proyectos vemos un proceso inverso: animales que sirven de met\u00e1fora de lo humano. \u201c\u00a1Buena Suerte!\u201d retrata un particular y fascinante zool\u00f3gico de especies capaces de reinventarse, regenerarse, resistir y sobrevivir. Act\u00faan como amuletos o fetiches de un cambio enriquecedor por venir. Est\u00e1 el Axolotl, ese ser de apariencia alien\u00edgena capaz de regenerar sus \u00f3rganos m\u00e1s complejos, o el Tard\u00edgrado, el oso de agua milim\u00e9trico que puede hibernar durante siglos y volver a la vida. Est\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n la Plectranthus Verticillatus, com\u00fanmente conocida como Planta del Dinero, mostrada en una especie de danza sin fin: es la planta que, si se regala, nos traer\u00e1 la bonanza econ\u00f3mica; la que, si se rompe, vuelve a desarrollar ra\u00edces y a proliferar con abundancia. Todos estos seres componen ese deseo de Ruth G\u00f3mez de buena suerte y cambio glorioso para aquellos que ahora se asoman a la necesidad de reinventarse o resistir.  \n\n                      Guillermo Espinosa", "title": "\u00a1 BUENA SUERTE !

The game is about a group of \"terrorists\" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.\n\nA small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses? Who is still alive, even?\"\n\nHutch: http://www.youtube.com/user/EatMyDiction1\nChilled: http://www.youtube.com/user/CriousGamers\nNick - http://www.youtube.com/eatmydiction1\nBrennon - http://www.youtube.com/goldglovetv\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "FAST FOOD FUN (Trouble in Terrorist Town)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-18T16:00:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApG33b-YVMo", "description": "An old swing tune played on my Gretsch G5129", "title": "Honeysuckle Rose", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T05:43:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApGNbvejiGc", "description": "Down south, island residents made their way to the polls bright and early to cast their vote as to who will be their voice of change and betterment of the island.", "title": "Despite unfavorable weather, southerners come out to vote", "publishedDate": "2014-08-30T07:18:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApGWrorrWT0", "description": "I have discussed only important points you need to know for MRCPCH examination, hope it will benefit you thank you.

Son of the officer  (and later, general), as a young boy he also attended army service and training in the Officer Kadet School in Poznan. After the end of the Polish-Soviet War, as an officer he was demobilised in 1921 and under his family pressure, he started the law studies in the Warsaw University.  After joining the college life, he discovered his true calling, and started performing in the university theatre. Noticed  by the actor Edmund Wiercinski, he eventually joined the famous actors' studio -- Reduta, run by the most famous actor of the 1920s Warsaw stages, Juliusz Osterwa. It's where he met his future wife, also an actress Maria Zielenkiewicz. After two years in Reduta, \u017babczy\u0144ski got engagement to the leading theatres: Polski (The Polish Theatre) and Narodowy (National Theatre) in Warsaw, he also performed in Lwow, Poznan and \u0141odz. In the end of 1920s he also showed himself to the audiences of the popular Warsaw cabaret Morskie Oko as well as Warsaw Operetta, immediately gaining popularity. In 1930s he became one of  most beloved by the teenagers actors of the musical comedy. He performed in the movies \"Manewry mi\u0142osne\", \"Ada, to nie wypada\", \"Jadzia\", \"Pani minister ta\u0144czy\", \"Zapomniana melodia\", \"Sportowiec mimo woli\". The fact, that many roles were written especially for him, proves, he was one of three most popular actors in Poland: together with Eugeniusz Bodo and Adolf Dymsza.\n \n\nIn September 1939, with the onset of WWII, that talented and loved actor immediately returned into his uniform. He fought in the artillery in the ant-Nazi September campaign and, after collapse of defense of the Polish Army, he managed to flee to Romania, from where -- after Romania bacame the Hitler's ally -  he fled to Hangary. There he was interned as soon as Hangary also joined pro-Nazi course, yet he managed, again, to flee. In France he joined the Polish Emigree Army and after the Nazi invasion on France, he, with his troops, was evacuated to Great Britain, from where he was sent to the Middle East. In 1942, as a captain of the famous Polish 2nd Corpse in the British Army, he followed its battle trek through Palestine, Egipt to Italy, where he was wounded during the battle for Monte Cassino and, in 1946,  decorated with the Cross of The Braves.  After te war he tried to find the place for him working in the Polish Red Cross in Salzburg, but in 1947 he decided to return to Poland. \n\nUnfortunately, under Stalinist regime there were no roles for that pre-war \u201eburgeois\" bon - vivant who most favourably performed the counts or young landlords -- the characters most hated by communist propaganda.  The fact, that he was the son of the pre-war general who had fought against bolshevics in the 1920-Polish-Soviet war, did not help him receive any serious offer. Almost forgotten and pushed aside by the ambitious younger generation of actors, he continued performing secondary roles in the Classical and Polish Theatres in Warsaw. He died of the hart attack in 1958 and is buried in the Military Powazki Cemetery in Warsaw.", "title": "Aleksander Zabczynski & Henryk Gold Orch. - Nadine, 1934", "publishedDate": "2008-01-03T22:33:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApICgqGlmd4", "description": "Falcon 9 Cassiope launch on 9 Sep 2013", "title": "Falcon 9 :: Cassiope", "publishedDate": "2013-09-29T17:04:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApIDd39LUGc", "description": "FastenMaster video comparing installing ThruLOK with carriage bolts.", "title": "FastenMaster ThruLOK vs. Carriage Bolts", "publishedDate": "2011-07-28T14:43:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApIE-M3z0YU", "description": "Sequence Coach Paul Kopp and PGA Tour player Steve Elkington demonstrate how to waggle the club properly - Episode #1145\n\nAbout Secret In the Dirt: Secret In The Dirt is a golf social learning platform and content provider created by Mike Maves, PGA tour winner Steve Elkington, and PGA tour legend Jackie Burke.

Gameplay varies in style and composition but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, military simulations, historical reenactments, to competition target shooting events. Combat situations on the battlefield often involve the use of common military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants typically emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. Two similar alternatives to this sport are paintball and Reballing, a paintless paintball with firm foam pellets.\"\n\ntags:\nairsoft cqb first person footage go pro gopro contour hd hour game january factory meat packing plant ach airwolf eas tokyo marui sig 552 mp7a1 p90 fn hk swiss arms gun war wars sniper games snipers warfare call duty battlefield softair air soft Scotland M60 magpul M4 Sig226 cod3 g&g m16 m203 grenade launcher dboys scoutthedoggie youtube partner army military CQB uniforms weapons skirmish wargame redwolf evike airsoftgi fps petebatman g&G scar-l scar wtfproduktionz asianwithhat ttlylegitdood", "title": "Kilroy From MAKOTV And The MACC (@OP: Doubloon 2)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T21:17:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "AphqERjKPY4", "description": "PORCUPINE BEZOAR \u7bad\u732a\u67a3/\u8c6a\u732a\u67a3\n\u5bf9\u80ba\u764c\u3001\u809d\u764c\u3001\u767d\u8840\u75c5\u3001\u8111\u819c\u708e\u3001\u6dcb\u5df4\u764c\uff0c\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u5316\u89e3\u5316\u7597\u3001\u624b\u672f\u9547\u75db\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u91cd\u751f\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u590d\u539f\uff01\n+60105426358\nporcupinedate2u@gmail.com", "title": "\u7bad\u732a\u67a3", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T10:04:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "AphxyjrH4SE", "description": "Spock and Kirk fight each other", "title": "Star Trek - Spock vs Kirk Battle Scene", "publishedDate": "2011-01-11T06:55:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApjDSGZWHsw", "description": "Paramecium close up view under microscope (organelles, vacuoules, vibrating cilia can be seen).\n\nParamecium is a group of unicellular ciliate protozoa, which are commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group, and range from about 50 to 350 \u03bcm in length. Simple cilia cover the body, which allow the cell to move with a synchronous motion (like a caterpillar) at speeds of approximately 2,700\u03bcm/second (12 body lengths per second). There is also a deep oral groove containing inconspicuous compound oral cilia (as found in other peniculids) used to draw food inside. They generally feed on bacteria and other small cells. Osmoregulation is carried out by a pair of contractile vacuoles, which actively expel water from the cell absorbed by osmosis from their surroundings.\n\nParamecia are widespread in freshwater environments, and are especially common in scums. Recently, some new species of Paramecia have been discovered in the oceans.\n\nCertain single-celled eukaryotes, such as Paramecium, are examples for exceptions to the universality of the genetic code: in their translation systems a few codons differ from the standard ones.", "title": "Paramecium close up (organelles, vacuoules, cilia can be seen)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-17T23:55:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "ApjKmFMv34Q", "description": "(rustyscuffer)", "title": "White kid tries rapping..", "publishedDate": "2013-05-10T15:34:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "Apk4hfaOm28", "description": "No Gun Game in Advanced Warfare?

But really it's about self-discovery and redefinition and all that. The idea is that each episode will focus on a name that Bob's contemplating adopting, and the art style will change to reflect on his thoughts. It's supposed to be really experimental and allow for a wide range of expression. Tl;dr the very format of the show is based on the idea that the format is infinitely malleable and I can do whatever I want. Heck, I could have a live action episode or a goanimate episode if I wanted.\n\nIt isn't really obvious at this point in the story, but Bob represents someone who is dissatisfied with his notion of self for cynical reasons, while Junior is dissatisfied with his notion of self for idealist reasons. On a larger scale they represent the follies of descriptivism and prescriptivism respectively.\n\nI have a lot planned for this, but only if people like it. So leave your thoughts in the comments below!\n\nOh, and music credits: The thing that plays during the squirrel sequence is \"Carnival Realm 1\" from the soundtrack of Glover.

In Bangladesh, it is called \"Time Fuul\", meaning \"Time Flower\", because the flower has a specific time to bloom. In Vietnam, it is called \"Hoa m\u01b0\u1eddi gi\u1edd\" meaning \"Ten o'clock flower\", because the flower is usually in full bloom at 10 o'clock in the morning.\n\nIt is a small, but fast-growing annual plant growing to 30 cm tall, though usually less. However if it is cultivated properly it can easily reach this height. The leaves are thick and fleshy, up to 2.5 cm long, arranged alternately or in small clusters. The flowers are 2.5--3 cm diameter with five petals, variably red, orange, pink, white, and yellow.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Tweet me @mariobatali with hashtag #howtotuesday!\n\n-------------------------------\nAIOLI - SASSO STYLE\n\n3 egg yolks\n4-5 garlic cloves\n2 lemons, juiced\n2 cups olive oil\n \nPut the egg yolks, lemon juice and garlic in the base of a food processor.  Blend on high for at least 2 minutes to create a light, smooth base for the oil to get blended into.  Drizzle the oil in a very thin stream into the egg mixture, slowly and with caution at first.  The oil will quickly begin to create a thick, mayonnaise-like emulsification with the eggs.  It is always a good idea to have some water around while making alioli to ensure that if the mixture gets to thick you can smooth it out with a neutral liquid. Continue adding the oil, more steadily as you go on, until you have a perfectly blended, smooth and creamy alioli. Season with salt.  If it is too rich in taste, adjust with more lemon juice.", "title": "Mario Batali's How-To Tuesday: Aioli", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T16:05:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AqnYeXMvqm8", "description": "Film.- No apto para todo el p\u00fablico\nSinopsis: Minako Aino se enamoro, vivio feliz, pero ahora sabe que la felicidad va acompa\u00f1ado de la tristeza. \nTrailer: Dream Sailor Venus - Minako Aino\nAnimation in Daz Studio 3.1\nSoftware: Daz Studio 3.1\nShaders\nAcartoonDZ: Cel Shading Toon Shading\n\nShaders Free ACartoonDZ+Effects for Animations\nfor Daz Studio 3.1 or compatible 4.x\nCreate style Cartoon, Anime, Manga\n\n\u2022 Gel Light\n\u2022 Camera Light\n\u2022 Camera Effect\n\u2022 Shaders Cartoon (Cel-Shadng Toon Shading)\n\u2022 Shader Shadow Catcher\n\u2022 Shader Transluce\n\u2022 Shaders Effects for Transparency (for shadow or light)\n\u2022 Shaders granite, brick, marble, wave 2D, wave 3d, ...\n\u2022 Light UV for shaders (Fake Light)\n\u2022 Shader Suit +Effects\n\u2022 Mix Cartoon and Real (change fast).\nTutorial for convertion VMD to BVH compatible DAZ Studio (Miku Miku Dance)\nTutorial Animations with D-Forms for motions\nSample convertion the motion for Animate the Mambo Five\nPrice: :-)\nDownload\nhttp://www.sharecg.com/v/69698/browse/7/Material-and-Shader/Shaders-for-cartoon-%2B-Effects-for-animations\nhttp://www.sharecg.com/v/69707/browse/3/PDF-Tutorial/Tutorial-Animation-for-DAZ-%2B-motion-Animate-M.-Fiv\n\nsite:http://narucoman.deviantart.com\n\nVoice \n11linda - Freesound\nhttp://ameangelofsin.weebly.com/\n\nFANMADE Animaciones en 3D con estilo Cartoon (Cel-shading toon-Shading) de los Superheroes de los 50's,60's,70's,80's,90's,2000,2010,2020, Como un Tributo Homenaje y parodia de las caricaturas y Anime occidental y oriental.\nSuperGirl Vs.

Peter Iliff\nFilm Description: In his first feature following the success of television's Dawson's Creek, James Van Der Beek stars as Jonathan Moxon, the back-up quarterback on his high-school football team, the West Canaan Coyotes. In West Canaan, the only thing that matters is football, and the man who matters is the one with 22 divisional championships, coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). Mox, as the young \"A\" student is called, is wrapping up his senior year on his way to Brown University in the shadow of his childhood friend, star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker). With only five games until the end of the season, Kilmer pushes his players too hard, and Lance suffers a career-ending injury, forcing Mox to play and win the game. Now the starter, Mox must deal with his newfound celebrity; the attentions of Lance's girlfriend, head-cheerleader Darcy (Ali Larter); prevent his friends and fellow players Billy Bob (Ron Lester) and Tweeder (Scott Caan) from self-destructing; prevent Coach Kilmer from crushing everybody; and hold on to his own girlfriend, Lance's sister Jules (Amy Smart). Oh, and Mox must also win the championship and prove himself the hero.\n\n\"varsity blues\",\"varsity blues clip\",\"varsity blues wale\",\"varsity blues part 1\",\"scott caan\",\"james van der beek\",\"thomas f duffy\",\"ron lester\",\"jill parker-jones\",\"football pads videos\",\"football videos\",\"sports dramas\",drama,football,\"sports stories\",\"van toffler\",\"david gale\",\"michael tollin\",\"herb gains\",\"brian robbins\",\"elysa koplovitz\",\"martin wiley\",\"tova laiter\",\"ruben hostka\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++174353,/m/02v72_,/m/0c9m3b,/m/03_dxb,/m/0cct39c,/m/0gc26w3", "title": "Varsity Blues (9/9) Movie CLIP - Billy Bob's Touchdown (1999) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-17T21:59:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AqqewJZcWyc", "description": "", "title": "Enunciation", "publishedDate": "2011-12-19T04:50:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "AqqioWlvRcA", "description": "Digital Download : *123 2288\niTunes Download : http://goo.gl/oQUTQF\nKKBOX : http://kkbox.fm/rc2ZPJ\n\n\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07 : Cross Love (OST.

By switching on Constellation we can bring back the experience of a community worshipping together, while switching it off provides optimum acoustics for amplified music.\" -  Jeff Miller, Sound Technology Consultants \n\n\"Isn't worship supposed to be participation, not merely a performance? I believe so, and that's why I designed the architecture here as a giant, three-dimensional hug.

The venomous lionfish are considered a danger to people, coral reefs and commercial fisheries. (August 4)Netting these beautiful but dangerous fish in the Atlantic is the first line of defense against a fast-growing and hungry army of invaders.A voracious predator, lionfish are an exotic species whose population explosion continues to threaten the U-S east coast and spread further south throughout the Caribbean.Scientists are struggling to understand this fast moving phenomenon ... But they are already sounding the alarm.\"They have just literally exploded through time, a population explosion - it is like a plague of locusts.\" Oregon State University Professor Mark Hixon was leading a team of research students studying coral reefs in the 1990s when they first noticed invasive lionfish. They were forced to change their research matter when the lionfish moved in.\"What we found was that lionfish reduce the abundance of small fish on coral reefs by 80 percent in just a five week period.\"The U-S government has continued to monitor lionfish spottings and tracked a substantial jump in sightings in 2004.\"They went up the Gulf Stream into North Carolina and established a population, over to Bermuda and then in about 2004 we started seeing them in the Bahamas.\"And scuba divers in the Bahamas first started noticing isolated specimens ...\"We started off with one fish at one site that we knew of. Then we see another fish at another site and then another one, but the explosion didn't really hit until about 2007, that's when we really started noticing a difference and they were noticed everywhere - in groups of four and five and six fish even in just these coral heads of massive amounts of fish,\" says Sally Burrows, from the Stuart Cove Dive Company.Andy Dehart, the National Aquarium Director of Biological Programs, says there is no agreement on how the popular aquarium tank fish ended up in the Atlantic.Some believe aquarium breaches during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 released lionfish into the Bay of Biscayne and from there they spread, slowly at first.Experts say Caribbean reefs now face the prospect of turning into a vast nursery for the remarkably adaptable predator.The region's warm waters are allowing the tropical fish to colonize a far greater area than they can up north.There is widespread concern that the demise of the small reef fish will add more stress to fragile coral reefs.\"If we start loosing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish and the lionfish population get out of control, we can certainly be in a whirlwind for bad things coming for the reef ecosystem.\"Volunteer scuba divers, working with local governments, have established an early warning detection system to track the lionfish's expansion.But some say it may be too late ...\"We are not very optimistic at this point that eradication is possible, because the lionfish population has grown so rapidly.\"", "title": "Lionfish Population Has Scientists Worried", "publishedDate": "2008-08-04T21:25:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ar0jZGesWzI", "description": "High Quality grape peel massage and relaxing bath in day spas located in Chicago, Illinios.

Insects can get trapped in spider webs, providing nutrition to the spider; however, not all spiders build webs to catch prey, and some do not build webs at all. \"Spider web\" is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use (i.e. clean), whereas \"cobweb\" refers to abandoned (i.e. dusty) webs. However, \"cobweb\" is used to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the Therididae family. Whilst this large family is also known as the tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders and comb-footed spiders, they actually have a huge range of web architectures.\n\nSCRIPT \n\nWhen it comes to the strongest biological material in the world, nothing comes close to the Spider Web  \n\nSpiders make their webs from a silk they create. This silk, according to scientists is five times stronger than Piano Wire. \n\nIn Madagascar, there is a spider called Darwin's Bark Spider. This Spider's silk is said to be the strongest in the world -  10 times stronger than the Kevlar used to make bullet proof vests!  \n\nThe strongest spider web I have ever personally seen was in the Amazon region of Brazil \n\nI was on a hike with some fellow travelers... we had gone to see this amazing cave in the middle of the jungle. It was huge .... It had this amazing waterfall and It was filled with thousands of bats...All the walls and ceilings were covered with them... \n\n It also had more than enough spiders lurking around to creep out anybody... even Chuck Norris  \n\nOn our way back, my good friend and guide,  Wellington Melo, stopped and pointed at a spider web...\n\nYou want to see how strong it is? \n\nJust how such small spiders can make a material so strong is a question scientists are racing to figure out.

This experimental avant-garde ensemble is now ready to conquer the European market and has geared up with a unique compilation, Badtriptych, presenting 22 of the best tracks from their previous \"Bad Trip Simulator\" album series.\n\n\"Bad trip is a slang term for a psychedelic crisis, a disturbing experience sometimes associated with use of a psychedelic drug such as LSD, Salvinorin A, mescaline, psilocybin or DMT. The manifestations can range from feelings of vague anxiety and alienation to profoundly disturbing states of unrelieved terror, ultimate entrapment, or cosmic annihilation. Add some Samba to that and you will have the time of your life!\"\n\nOn Badtriptych the band encapsulates their fight against the common perceptions of Brazilian popular music, by incorporating elements traditionally considered as taboos in this category of music: distortion, cynicism, dissonance, confusion, vocal screams, clashing harmonies and obscure sounding notes. Armed with remarkable skills, creativity and innovation Satanique Samba Trio has come to put your musical senses up for a true challenge, far away from the easefulness of samba and bossanova as you know it. \n\nDrawing inspiration from artists such as Anton Webern, Milton Banana Trio, Gustav Mahler and Banda de P\u00edfanos de Caruaru, SS3 serves up music that is as complex as it is fun and as strange as it is catchy. Bassist and composer Munha da 7 describes the purpose of Satanique Samba Trio's music as a concept developed as a relief for ears tired by mainstream radio play lists composing our lives. They are musicians with a mission to offer not only music for the joys and positive moments of life but to provide a soundtrack to accompany also the darkness and horror of our everyday lives.\n\nBadtriptych isn't the album to put on in the background, but will fight every second for your undivided attention - as soon as you think you have grasped the essence of their intriguing sound you will get thrown head first into their imaginative world of tricks and treats. In this mix of short and explosive tracks you can clearly hear elements of a variety of genres and all mixed together the ensemble manage to present a brand new and fresh sound. Horrifying, intriguing, confusing and brilliant -- all at the same time!\n\nIf you're at all a fan of mainstream music it is at first sight easy to reject this peculiar band, with their rebellious images and obscure statements. But if you're brave enough to step out of your comfort zone you can very much appreciate Satanique Samba Trio's extravagant music. Badtriptych is original, different, innovative and venturous and is foremost well written art performed by extraordinary musicians. It's like one of those horrible coloured pieces of clothes, for example mustard yellow; at first it's hideous and stings your eyes. But with time -- when you got used to it, tried it on and worn it a few times, it turns into something interesting, cool and wearable -- just give it a chance and the right tools and it totally works!", "title": "Satanique Samba Trio 'Lambada Post Mortem' [Far Out Recordings - Subtropical Psychedelia]", "publishedDate": "2014-01-23T15:13:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ar9OZ9mOc8w", "description": "Album Historia de amor", "title": "PAROUSIA - Otra oportunidad", "publishedDate": "2011-07-17T10:51:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ar9Rlh4P6IM", "description": "great t drink very healthy\nhas iron for ur blood vit k and calcuim magnesium for ur heart and lots more\nalso is an alkalizer\npost ur comments", "title": "you can juice with a blender!!!!!!!!!!", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T01:44:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ar9y9BZ1ipg", "description": "*Important* Please note the annotations at the beginning of the video.

But they are also real businesses: dynamic, innovative and competitive.\n\nChernomorka is a clothing cooperative which was founded 60 years ago and now employs around 70 people, half of them disabled. Here, all strategic decisions are taken by majority vote at general meetings. For example in 2003, the cooperative decided to develop its own range of children's clothes. Today, they produce 100 new designs a year, using high-quality fabrics from Italy.  \n\nMaya Marinova, the president of Chernomorka, told euronews: \"Of course, that has had an impact on the financial situation of the cooperative. Turnover has increased by 5-10 percent a year, and we've taken on lots of people, including disabled workers. Before, we had eight to 10 employees on this line but now seven years later we have 30.\"\n\nDuring the time they have produced their own range and sold it in shops or on the internet, lots of things have changed at Chernomorka. But the socially responsible aim of providing therapy through work for disabled people has remained the same. \n\nThrough various projects supported by European Structural Funds, like the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, the cooperative has received around 190,000 euros in financing over five years, to train workers, buy new machines, improve air quality and soon, to install solar panels. \n\nMaya Marinova, said: \"Our aim is to improve the quality of our production and at the same time make working conditions better for disabled workers. And of course to improve productivity, that's the most important thing.\"\n\nFor her the key to success is the cooperative, which is a form of democratic business. Integrating disabled people into the production process is also key, as well as the stability and financial independence of the cooperative.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "euronews business planet - Cooperative and competitive", "publishedDate": "2012-06-15T10:45:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "ArDlMCFx_tI", "description": "", "title": "MR SALSA EUGENIO Y JULIAN MATOS EN SALSOLA TOTAL CLUB MANO GUAYABO  EL BRONX,NY", "publishedDate": "2011-03-02T22:12:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "ArEBFLZsK8s", "description": "Official video of Thomas Dolby performing Silk Pyjamas from the album Astronauts & Heretics. \nBuy It Here: http://smarturl.it/p69km2 \nLike Thomas Dolby on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/officialthomasdolby\nFollow Thomas Dolby on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thomasdolby \nOfficial Website: http://www.thomasdolby.com/ \nOfficial YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/thomasdolby", "title": "Thomas Dolby - Silk Pyjamas", "publishedDate": "2009-04-15T20:17:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "ArE_BqO-YPk", "description": "Newly installed sewage pump for a basement bathroom.

Very good video, must watch!\n\nThe octopus (pron.: /\u02c8\u0252kt\u0259p\u028as/ or pron.: /\u02c8\u0252kt\u0259p\u0259s/; plural: octopuses, octopi, or octopodes; see below) is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. Octopuses have two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, they are bilaterally symmetric. An octopus has a hard beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. Octopuses have no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing them to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally flexible of all invertebrates.\nThe octopus inhabits many diverse regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the ocean floor. They have numerous strategies for defending themselves against predators, including the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and deimatic displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, and their ability to hide. An octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims. All octopuses are venomous, but only one group, the blue-ringed octopus, is known to be deadly to humans.[4]\nAround 300 species are recognized, which is over one-third of the total number of known cephalopod species. The term 'octopus' may also be used to refer only to those creatures in the genus Octopus.\n\nThe giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini, is often cited as the largest octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15 kg (33 lb), with an arm span of up to 4.3 m (14 ft).[34] The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71 kg (156.5 lb).[35] The alternative contender is the seven-arm octopus, Haliphron atlanticus, based on a 61 kg (134 lb) carcass estimated to have a live mass of 75 kg (165 lb).[36][37] However, a number of questionable size records would suggest E. dofleini is the largest of all octopus species by a considerable margin;[38] one such record is of a specimen weighing 272 kg (600 lb) and having an arm span of 9 m (30 ft).[39]\n\nOctopuses have an amazing ability to squeeze through tiny crevices, cracks and holes. My fall BIOS independent studies student, Raymond Deckel is investigating just how small a hole Octopus macropus can fit through as well as how long it takes them to squeeze through different sizes of holes. CAABS intern Rowena Day, NSF-REU intern Jared Kibele as well as teaching assistant Abel Valdivia help wrangle the 232 g octopus, Ray times it's escape through a 1 inch hole while I shot video clips for later analysis.
