Hopefully, this will help those who never been on a cruise and those who may be bound to a standard wheelchair, motorized wheelchair, etc. As you will see the gangway is very wheelchair accessible and isn't too steep to push someone up. A word of caution though -- just before you enter the ship there is another slight ramp that is slightly steeper than the rest of the gangway. Those who are pushing wheelchairs should turn around and pull the individual up this short section then onto the ship.  Furthermore, for those that might be wondering about how crowed the gangway can get; it really depends on the time you get there and checked in. Quite honestly RCCL do a really good job in processing their passengers through. They don't take very long in processing, so there is very little congestion on the gangway as a result.", "title": "Gangway: The Walk Up and boarding of the Oasis of the Seas", "publishedDate": "2013-09-29T02:27:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2I8zb93q1XY", "description": "AHRIMAN -   E.M.N  (FUNERAL TRANSILVANO) \noctubre del 2013 ensayo, guitarristas de sesi\u00f3n......\nIn the memory of Per Yngve Ohlin", "title": "AHRIMAN - FUNERAL TRANSILVANO", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T15:52:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "2I9H9fQsLtw", "description": "About: RDU Appliance Repair\n\nWe fix and repair washers, dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers, microwaves, stoves, ovens and much more.\n\nOur service area covers Raleigh, Cary, Durham, Garner, Clayton, Smithfield, Apex, Fuquay, Knightdale, Wake Forest, Zebulon, North Carolina and all the towns in between.

Bill Morgan, Director of Operations for the plant spent time Saturday taking a group on a tour on the West Branch facility. On display the latest turbine, the AW3000, it is double the generating power of a standard turbine and takes a lot of hour and hands to construct. \"So a 1.5 it takes 10 people total from pre-assembly to pre-hub and final assembly\" 18:03:21 \"A 3.0 you're looking at 12 to 14 people and 650 to roughly 750 man hours,\" Morgan said. While Acciona proudly showed off its new wind turbine the AW3000 questions loom on the governments uncertain future for wind energy. It's already caused some companies to lay off workers but that's not the case for this company. \"We feel pretty confident in our business for the near future,\" says Peter Gray, Communications Manager. American wind power companies like Acciona relying on government production tax credits for business but right now those tax credits for wind energy are taking a back seat to the country's national debt. One thing Acciona has going for them is the ability to produce large orders in other markets nation wide\"We can serve Canadian, Mexican and other countries markets which opens up more opportunities for us,\" Gray said. With that said even Acciona knows there's a greater push for wind farms here in the U.S and they too urge Washington to take heed. \"Obviously for any business we could be growing more if we knew there was going to be a steady stable investment here,\" says Gray.", "title": "West Branch Wind Power Plant Acciona Speaks on Wind Energy Future", "publishedDate": "2012-08-26T04:37:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IE6e8bpwOw", "description": "The video in which I announce Butter Day\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1SEIxz7UyA\n\nOther Channels:\nVLOGS http://youtube.com/wheezynews\nGAMING http://youtube.com/wheezygamer1\niPHONE http://youtube.com/alwayswheezy\n\nYou can follow me here:\nGoogle+ http://bit.ly/wheezyplus\nFacebook http://facebook.com/wheezywaiter\nTwitter http://twitter.com/wheezywaiter\n\nThanks for the wink\nhttp://youtube.com/Brettcat38", "title": "Pleasing Everyone", "publishedDate": "2012-09-24T21:55:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IEbTJPgDhk", "description": "Fox 11 Undercover News spot from the mid 90's.", "title": "Fox 11 Undercover:  Cruising, Lowriding, Crenshaw,Whittier", "publishedDate": "2011-11-18T08:12:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IEmCEKVVLs", "description": "", "title": "Freedom violate propriety- walk away", "publishedDate": "2010-10-03T06:19:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IFF9yu5i3k", "description": "\u00a9 2008 WMG\nCarry You Home (Video)\nPre-order the 'Apollo Edition' featuring 5 new tracks: http://smarturl.it/ApolloEdition\n\nBuy 'Moon Landing' on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/moonlanding-itunes\nBuy 'Moon Landing' on Amazon: http://smarturl.it/moon-amazon\n\n-----------------------\nFollow James on \nWebsite: http://jamesblunt.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jamesblunt\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/jamesblunt", "title": "James Blunt - Carry You Home (Video)", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T00:25:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IFq5G5_GlU", "description": "Human League , Dare Tour , 25th Nov 2007 Fantastic", "title": "Human League Dare Tour First Night Opening Song", "publishedDate": "2007-11-28T21:51:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2IG5gFNx_LQ", "description": "Subscribe!

Forage daikon radishes are in the brassica family and have as good or better protein and mineral content as other members of the brassica family including turnips and rape.\n\nNot only do these forage daikon radishes provide attraction but they also aerate your soil, build organic matter, and increase nutrient content in the root zone. The forage daikon radish shoots under the ground rapidly decompose in early spring to create a void in the soil which aerates the soil. At the same time, the decomposing forage daikon radish shoots provide new organic matter for your plots. The third thing forage daikon radishes do to improve the soil is to reach down and pull nutrients from deep underground and use them in the development of the shoot which decompose later in the spring. There are many more functions of forage daikon radishes - all of which produce better soil quality.\n\nLike other brassica family members that make a bulb like turnips and forage beets (Forage Rape varieties do not produce a bulb), it is recommended that you rotate forage daikon radishes every few years to avoid potential long-term fungus problems. Every third year, you can plant a Forage Rape variety to eliminate fungus problems however fungus issues are a rare problem that we have only ran into once in all of our food plot acres. One other item to keep in mind is that forage daikon radishes do not do well on wet sites so don't plant them in areas that stay too wet all winter long or you will get little to no growth. ...

Taking a page from her bestie Taylor Swift\u2019s playbook, the song is indeed all about her emotional, and at times, tumultuous relationship with Justin Bieber. \nThe song opens up with a raw audio \u2013 both literally and figuratively -- of Selena talking about Justin, and it\u2019s really something you should hear for yourself. Check it out:\nWhoa, so that\u2019s basically like she\u2019s CONFIRMING he\u2019s cheated on her right? If so, we gotta give props to Selena for getting so vulnerable. I\u2019m sure there are tons of people who\u2019ve been in this position, so maybe this song can help them.\nThe lyrics are just as emotional and telling, with some of them reading:\n\u201cYou got me sippin on something/I can't compare to nothing\u201d with the chorus saying: \u201cSave your advice 'cause I won't hear/You might be right but I don't care/There's a million reasons why I should give you up/But the heart wants what it wants\u201d\nThis might leave fans confused \u2013 as per usual \u2013 as to what Jelena\u2019s relationship status is, and we think it\u2019s safe to say that she is single and ready to mingle. Selena stopped by Ryan Seacrest\u2019s KIIS FM radio show on Thursday and said that she played the song for Justin and he thought it was beautiful, but it was hard to listen to. She also mentioned she doesn\u2019t know what the future hold, but when Ryan asked how she feels about Bieber she said:\n\u201cI support him, I think I always will. I\u2019m upset when he\u2019s upset I\u2019m happy when he\u2019s happy.\u201d\nThen in the next breath she joked about online dating, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that means she\u2019s single? Oh Selena, you always keep us guessing.\nBut back to the song! \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants\u201d will be part of her greatest hits compilation titled \u201cFor You,\u201d which fans can pick up on November 24.\nAlright guys, what do YOU think of Selena\u2019s new song? Do you think she\u2019s done with Justin for good? Hit the comments to share your feelings, then click HERE to get a run down on all the other fellas she\u2019s \u201cdated\u201d besides the Biebs.

This is the one of 15 November 2011, one of the more violently explosive in the series, and we had the chance to see it at rather close distance (between 0.9 and 1.5 km away). This has also some of the best sound of all my movies of these events.\n\nThe first part of the movie shows the relatively mild Strombolian activity that heralded the main lava fountaining phase.

This is a personnel issue, and it is confidential until resolved.

As a condition for receiving the necessary funds, Conor is saddled with coaching a corporate-sponsored Little League baseball team for underprivileged youth in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project. Reluctant at first, Conor slowly begins to enjoy his new authority role, especially when he makes the acquaintance of his players' attractive teacher, Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane).

Every cell uses it, but your heart needs it the most to beat non-stop, and to send oxygen and nutrient-rich blood throughout the body without skipping a beat.  With CoQ10, your heart cannot perform its role effectively.  CoQ10 helps keep you healthy, protected, energized and nourished, especially as you age.  \n\nAt Bronson, we offer a variety of CoQ10 products, including our most popular potency, CoQ10 100 milligrams.  Furthermore, thousands of customers, taking millions of doses, have made CoQ10 100 milligrams in the 150 size Bronson's best-selling CoQ10 supplement.  And, when you combine Bronson's best-selling CoQ10 with a large, 300 count bottle size, you get Bronson's best value for CoQ10.\n\nAnd if that isn't enough, Bronson also offers several high-potency CoQ10 supplements, including CoQ10 400 milligrams, Bronson's highest potency CoQ10 supplement.\n\nCoQ10 with L-Carnitine is another CoQ10 product choice from Bronson.  In fact, it's Bronson's CoQ10 Featured Choice.  We've combined two of the most important ingredients in your body's recipe for total body energy production.  While CoQ10 fuels your heart, l-carnitine breaks down fats and feeds them to the tiny power generators in every cell in the body.  Helping to keep your heart beating strong and every cell functioning at the top of its game.  That's CoQ10 with L-Carnitine, Bronson's Featured Choice.\n\nIn other CoQ10 news, Ubiquinol, an easier-to-absorb, advanced active form of CoQ10, is Bronson's Finest CoQ10 supplement and the Pharmacist's Choice.  \n\nBronson's Kaneka QH Ubiquinol\u00ae is all-natural, bio-identical CoQ10, which provides all the benefits associated with CoQ10 in a pre-converted and more absorbable form.  In order for the body to utilize CoQ10, it must convert CoQ10 into ubiquinol.  In fact, the majority of CoQ10 found in the body is stored as ubiquinol.  Research suggests that the ability to convert CoQ10 into ubiquinol declines with age, especially after age 40.  In addition, some health conditions can impact the body's ability to effectively convert CoQ10 into ubiquinol.  \n\nWhy not make it easier on your body and eliminate that conversion step?  Bronson's Finest ubiquinol products, available in multiple potencies, absorb into the body and blood stream quicker and easier, going to work faster than CoQ10.\n\nWith so many Bronson CoQ10 choices, you can feel confident Bronson has the CoQ10 product that's just right for you.", "title": "CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10) Benefits and Bronson's Line Up", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T16:06:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2JyTuRLAps8", "description": "Visszat\u00e9rnek a r\u00f3mai l\u00e9gi\u00f3sok a Fert\u0151 partj\u00e1ra, \u00e9s t\u00e1bort \u00fctnek a Fert\u0151r\u00e1kosi K\u0151fejt\u0151ben.\n\nL\u00e1thatjuk, hogyan harcoltak a gladi\u00e1torok.\n\nBepillanthatunk a titokzatos Mithras-kultusz rejtelmeibe.\n\nBel\u00e9phet\u00fcnk az 1800 \u00e9ves Mithras-barlangba.\n\nK\u00e9zm\u0171ves foglalkoz\u00e1sok, \u00f3kori pantomim, zene \u00e9s t\u00e1nc sz\u00ednes\u00edti a programot.\n\nKorabeli \u00e9tkek, borbemutat\u00f3 \u00e9s v\u00e1s\u00e1r.", "title": "I.

Since the conventional corticosteroid treatment is only effective in 50-60% of patients a significant number of patients can be targeted with the new treatment options. While anterior uveitis patients represent the majority of patients, all but one of the new treatments in late stage clinical development target the intermediate, posterior and pan uveitis patient segment. The uveitis market is expected to grow between 2012 and 2017, due to the introduction of biologic drugs as well as a diversification of administrative routes. Market growth is created by the increase in treatment costs and will continue beyond the forecasted time period. The new treatments will target some key unmet needs but opportunities will remain for drugs capable of permanently inhibiting ocular inflammation as well as offering an improved safety profile.\nHighlights\nKey Questions Answered\n- The uveitis market is marked by the presence of a number of unmet needs in current treatments. What are the main unmet needs in this market? Will the drugs under development fulfil the unmet needs of the uveitis market?\n- The late-stage uveitis pipeline is filled with diverse molecules and routes of administration. Which drug will have a significant impact on the uveitis market.

Sofia is located at the foot of Mount Vitosha in the western part of the country. It occupies a strategic position at the centre of the Balkan Peninsula.[4] Sofia's history spans 2,400 years. Its ancient name Serdica derives from the local Celtic tribe of the Serdi who established the town in the 5th century BC. It remained a relatively small settlement until 1879, when it was declared the capital of Bulgaria.\n\nThe name Serdica or Sardica (in Greek \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae) was popular in Latin, Ancient Greek and Byzantine Greek sources from Antiquity and the Middle Ages; it was related to the local Celtic[7] tribe of the Serdi. The name was last used in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text, Service and hagiography of Saint George the New of Sofia: \u0412\u042a \u0421\u0410\u0420\u0414\u0410\u041a\u0406\u0418.\n\nSofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is surrounded by mountains on all sides. The valley has an average altitude of 550 metres (1,800 ft).\n\nSofia has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb bordering Cfa) with an average annual temperature of 11 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F).\n\nWinter weather can vary greatly. Typical are colder nights with on average temperatures of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) to \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) and milder days of normally around +6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Occasionally (once per 4\u20135 years, temperatures can drop as low as \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F), most notably in January. Foggy conditions are frequent, especially in the beginning of the season. On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of 90 cm (35.4 in) and 60 days with snow cover.\n\nSofia was originally a Thracian settlement called Serdica, or Sardica, possibly named after the Celtic tribe Serdi.[7] For a short period during the 4th century BC, the city was ruled by Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great. Around BC 29, Serdica was conquered by the Romans.\n\nMore Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia\n\nSofia01: vintagedept\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/vintagedept/4947808742\nSofia02: photolupi\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/photolupi/13916018229\nSofia03: Panoramas\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/ranopamas/65183944\nSofia04: Klearchos Kapoutsis\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/klearchos/2542754984\nSofia05: Panoramas\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/ranopamas/65181657", "title": "Sofia The First & Amazing - The Capital and Largest City Part I", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T15:49:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KASm3hQ9_Y", "description": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictly Simon Webbe and Kristina Rihanoff dance the Argentine Tango to 'El Tango De Roxanne' from the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.", "title": "Simon Webbe & Kristina Argentine Tango to 'El Tango De Roxanne'- Strictly Come Dancing: 2014 - BBC", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T21:10:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KAgdvqs73Y", "description": "\u30aa\u30cb\u30b4\u30c1\u306e\u5e7c\u9b5a\n\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u4e2d\u3067\u6700\u5c0f\n\u80f8\u9c2d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u3074\u3087\u3053\u3074\u3087\u3053\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52d5\u304f", "title": "\u30aa\u30cb\u30b4\u30c1\u3000Onigocia spinosa", "publishedDate": "2009-11-08T11:17:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KB7TxAiKKQ", "description": "www.salyut.am hravarutyun florens restoranum", "title": "www.salyut.am hravarutyun florens restoranum (099)(094)(055) 197030", "publishedDate": "2013-03-18T09:39:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBIMUPmcDw", "description": "off of doc strange's album psychogenesis produced by beej", "title": "Doc Strange - Forties", "publishedDate": "2014-08-10T05:15:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBOwtA57pM", "description": "spot Pali me tvoje tijelo", "title": "Jole Radonjic - Pali me tvoje tijelo", "publishedDate": "2008-11-28T11:49:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBVGiyi9dE", "description": "", "title": "SUMMER 2014!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T02:14:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBhlZrRt8Q", "description": "Will Shaprio - Subrogation 2012", "title": "Will Shaprio - Subrogation 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-02-08T17:59:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBmZvQpbrQ", "description": "Soldier speaking at the Military demarcation Line, which seperates the North koreans and the South Koreans at the DMZ.", "title": "Soldier speaking at the Military demarcation Line", "publishedDate": "2006-12-22T13:53:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KBqAnG4vso", "description": "Que ft.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a case as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools per day. Nevertheless, absolute limits of normalcy are difficult to define; any deviation from the child's usual pattern should arouse some concern (particularly with ill appearance, the passage of blood or mucus, or dehydration) regardless of the actual number of stools or their water content.The patient who requires volume resuscitation must be quickly identified. Clinical evidence of dehydration such as decreased urine output, tachycardia, and dry mucus membranes are already apparent at a deficit of 5 percent of body weight. The most useful signs for predicting a volume deficit of 5 percent or more include delayed capillary refill time greater than two seconds, reduced skin turgor, and deep respirations with or without an increase in respiratory rate, particularly if a combination of these findings is present.Diarrhea usually results in isotonic volume depletion. Although clinically significant electrolyte disturbances do not occur frequently, children who are ill-appearing or who have significant dehydration requiring intravenous rehydration should have serum electrolytes measured.In addition to identifying volume depletion, a thorough examination must be performed because systemic, non-enteric infections, particularly otitis media, may cause acute diarrhea. A palpable mass or peritonitis suggests appendicitis, intussusception or, less commonly, toxic megacolon. Generalized toxicity and/or shock may occur with hemolytic uremic syndrome or with sepsis, such as from Salmonella or staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome", "title": "Management of Diarrhea in children part 01 C", "publishedDate": "2011-12-09T00:20:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KK6SxZ44DQ", "description": "Jonah Lomu helps New Zealand sevens win and performs haka with Joeli Vidiri, Rico Gear, Christian Cullen, Eric Rush, Caleb Ralph etc.\n\nCommonwealth Games, Kuala Lumpur, 1998", "title": "Topless Jonah Lomu performs haka - old footage", "publishedDate": "2014-03-03T03:05:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KKCwfvqoNs", "description": "Understanding Compressed Air Systems and the importance of keeping air dry\n\nhttp://www.gosuburban.com\n\nhttp://www.tsunami.us.com", "title": "Compressed Air System Basics", "publishedDate": "2011-08-05T01:04:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KKJcphwIFg", "description": "CLASSIFICATION: THE NESTED HIERARCHY", "title": "CLASSIFICATION: THE NESTED HIERARCHY.avi", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T19:47:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KKMOjLTAGg", "description": "CASADEI FONTANA COLLECTION\nS/S 2012 COLLECTION\n\nDesign Objects in Motion -- Art and design are an on-going source of inspiration for Cesare Casadei.

It puts emphasis on spinal and pelvic alignment, breathing to relieve stress and allow adequate oxygen flow to muscles, developing a strong core or center (tones abdominals while strengthening the back), and improving coordination and balance. Pilates' flexible system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginning to advanced.

All chords contain extensions and are played in a standard song format, (I Maj7-vi7-ii7-V7), and repeats.  This creates the most popular 6-2-5-1 chord progression seen in Bebop jazz.  Because the submediant is Major, we add a 7th with occasional 7th b9 (flat-9) so you can explore the Bebop Dominant 7th and Half-Whole Diminished scales, two necessary scales for every advancing jazz musician!\n\nFeatures:\nEasy swing tempo of 140 beats per minute, nothing flies by too fast, giving you a chance to use difficult scale/tone choices.  \nAll tracks repeat the progression several times and are nearly 5:00 minutes long so you can dig in and practice at length.  No difficult melody to study, just the chords played by a jazz combo so you can focus on your improvisation skills.  \nCombo consists of standard bebop instrumentation:  Piano, Upright Bass and Drums. \n15 tracks include every standard Major key (no flats/sharps to 7 flats/sharps).", "title": "Jazz 251 Vol 02 - Major Submediant Backing Tracks", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T20:25:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KSdFBcGdhA", "description": "Gimme (Vocal) - Headman feat.

Sein erster \u00f6ffentlicher Auftritt war im Jahr 1958. Ab 1960 trat er mit der Johnny's New Orleans Jatzband in Jazzclubs und bei Festivals auf. Mit Barry Sarluis entstand das Album Jazz und \u00c4hnliches. 1968 wurde er mit dem Goldenen Mikrophon als bester Jazzs\u00e4nger ausgezeichnet. Im November 1968 nahm er bei Polydor seine erste Single Viel zu sp\u00e4t unter seinem b\u00fcrgerlichen Namen Peter Sauer auf. 1970 hatte Petrel einen Auftritt beim 1. Internationalen Songfestival in Tokio, wo er den achten Platz unter 46 L\u00e4nderteilnehmern belegte.\n1972 hatte er zusammen mit Jeannie McKinley als Duo Die Windows den Hit How do you do?, der ihnen eine Goldene Schallplatte bescherte. Die Windows waren ein paar Tage fr\u00fcher mit der englischen Fassung auf dem deutschen Markt als Mouth & MacNeal aus Holland. Es wurde ein Nr. 1-Hit. Erst danach kam eine deutsche Fassung von How do you do? auf den Markt und verkaufte sich 1,3 Millionen mal. Die englische Fassung des Liedes verkaufte sich dagegen ungef\u00e4hr 600.000 mal. McKinley zog sp\u00e4ter nach Schottland und wurde Mutter von vier S\u00f6hnen.\nPeter Petrel setzte fortan seine Karriere als Solo-Interpret bei Hansa Records fort. Erfolge konnte er mit Liedern wie Ich bin viel zu bescheiden und Ich fahr so gerne Rad erzielen. Seither ist er auf dem Gebiet des Schlagers popul\u00e4r. Im Zuge der Hamburger Szene gr\u00fcndete Petrel im Jahr 1974 mit Musikern wie Gottfried B\u00f6ttger die Rentnerband. Mit der Rentnerband hatte er den Hit Hamburger Deern, der Petrel abermals eine Goldene Schallplatte bescherte. Ferner erhielt das Lied den Preis Goldene Europa. Im Jahr 2004 nahm Petrel Hamburger Deern mit der Gruppe De R\u00e4uber neu auf.\nMit Ich bin viel zu bescheiden und Ein Mann wie ein Baum bekam Petrel auch zwei eigene Fernsehshows, die damals das ZDF produzierte. 1981 erhielt er den Deutschen Schallplattenpreis f\u00fcr die Dixielandplatte Happy Music Every Day mit der Sir Gusche Band. Seit Ende der 1980er Jahre tritt er mit der Band The Swinging Petrels auf, die dem Genre Traditional Jazz, Swing- und Soulmusik zuzuordnen sind. Ferner spielte Petrel auch mit Bands wie Old Merry Tale Jazzband und dem Gypsy Swingtett von Lulu Reinhardt zusammen. Der Jazz brachte ihn nach Kanada und in die USA (Ehrenb\u00fcrger in New Orleans seit 2000 mit Peter Wicherts New Orleans Connection), in die Niederlande, nach Schweden, in die Schweiz und nach Singapur und Hong Kong.\n1990 war Peter Petrel mit dem von Bianca komponierten Titel F\u00e4hrmann, hol' \u00fcber bei der Vorentscheidung zum Grand Prix der Volksmusik vertreten. Einen Erfolg hatte er im gleichen Jahr beim nieders\u00e4chsischen Wettbewerb Lieder so sch\u00f6n wie der Norden 1990, bei dem er mit dem Lied In Hamburg ist noch Licht an den vierten Platz belegte.\nIm Jahr 2004 ver\u00f6ffentlichte der Musikmanager Ulrich Eichblatt das Gesamtwerk von Die Windows auf zwei CDs; How do you do? und andere Titel wurden mit der S\u00e4ngerin Tina Wulf neu aufgenommen. Seit dem tritt Petrel \u2212 zusammen mit Wulf \u2212 wieder als Duo Die Windows auf. Im Herbst desselben Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlichte er aber auch ein Solo-Album.\nAm 22.

Several species of jicama occur, but the one found in [many] markets is Pachyrrizus erosus. The two cultivated forms of P. erosus are jicama de agua and jicama de leche.

The physiological effects of abiraterone acetate on steroidogenesis are indicated by arrows next to each steroid precursor. Abiraterone acetate inhibits 17-hydroxylase (blunt arrow), causing a decline in serum cortisol and a consequent rise in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (broken arrow). \n\nThis, in turn, results in the rise of deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone by approximately 10- and 40-fold, respectively. \n\nThe elevated deoxycorticosterone levels result in the expected toxicities of secondary mineralocorticoid syndrome. \n\nAbiraterone acetate also inhibits C17,20-lyase (blunt arrow) resulting in significant declines in dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), androstenedione and testosterone. \n\nAldosterone levels fall due to suppression of the renin\u2013angiotensin pathway by high levels of deoxycorticosterone. \n\nHowever, there is a four-fold increase in 11-deoxycortisol, which may be due to the increased ACTH levels driving the partial reversal of the activity of 17-hydroxylase but not C17,20-lyase.\n\n\n

die Vorl\u00e4ufersysteme von Typ-Ia-Supernovae\n\nThe multi-institutional Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) team has released the first-ever direct observations of a Type 1a supernova progenitor system. Astronomers have collected evidence indicating that the progenitor system of a Type 1a supernova, called PTF 11kx, contains a red giant star. This artist's conception shows a binary star system that produces recurrent novae, and ultimately, the supernova PTF 11kx. A red giant star (foreground) loses some of its outer layers though a stellar wind, and some of it forms a disk around a companion white dwarf star. This material falls onto the white dwarf, causing it to experience periodic nova eruptions every few decades. When the mass builds up to the near the ultimate limit a white dwarf star can take, it explodes as a Type Ia supernova, destroying the white dwarf.\n\nAnimation credit: Romano Corradi and the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias\n\nFor more on this, go to: http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2012/08/23/supernovae-of-the-same-brightness/", "title": "Rare Type 1a Supernova Progenitor System Observed", "publishedDate": "2012-08-24T22:03:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Kv06Y97TJA", "description": "Artists in motion's most recent project, a series shot in the jungles of Indonesia entitled \"Tarsier Tails\" which will be premiering on Channel 5", "title": "Tarsier Tails Sneak Peek", "publishedDate": "2012-07-13T15:14:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "2KvPuXzrirM", "description": "", "title": "in  hvac  chiller  problem  with  oil  pressure  switch", "publishedDate": "2012-09-21T18:55:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Kvuk0GFr0U", "description": "Suscr\u00edbete si te gusta / Subscribe if you like.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/jotunstudio\n\nhttp://jotunstudio.es\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/jotunstudio\n\n\nPrueba de una Jackson DKA7, prestada por Chusso Salas, de Doctor 3.

Tolkien, Fran Walsh\nFilm Description: New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval \"Middle-earth\" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the \"One Ring,\" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).\n\n\"lotr fellowship of the ring\",\"elijah wood\",\"sean astin\",\"billy boyd\",\"dominic monaghan\",\"ring videos\",\"action adventure\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"dramas based on the book\",fantasy,\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"barrie m osborne\",\"peter jackson\",\"fran walsh\",\"robert shaye\",\"rick porras\",\"jamie selkirk\",\"michael lynne\",\"mark ordesky\",\"ellen somers\",\"evil videos\",\"forest videos\",merry,\"frodo baggins\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++255996,/m/0svqs,/m/01v9l67,/m/01kwld,/m/015t56", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2/8) Movie CLIP - The Black Rider (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T02:09:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2L0BmNzL8E0", "description": "This short video is the first of my Howto's and I start by showing how to take geranium cuttings, for this demo I have used water you can of course put them into compost or soil, the forthcoming videos I will be showing how to transplant your cuttings into soil pots and eventually into your garden.

You'll close your eyes to the pictures. Then you'll close them to the memory. And then you'll close your eyes to the facts.\" These words are spoken at the beginning of an agitprop film that can be viewed as a unique and remarkable development. Farocki refrains from making any sort of emotional appeal. His point of departure is the following: \"When napalm is burning, it is too late to extinguish it. You have to fight napalm where it is produced: in the factories.\" Resolutely, Farocki names names: the manufacturer is Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Michigan in the United States. Against backdrops suggesting the laboratories and offices of this corporation, the film then proceeds to educate us with an austerity reminiscent of Jean Marie Straub. Farocki's development unfolds: \"(1) A major corporation is like a construction set. It can be used to put together the whole world. (2) Because of the growing division of labor, many people no longer recognize the role they play in producing mass destruction. (3) That which is manufactured in the end is the product of the workers, students, and engineers.\" This last thesis is illustrated with an alarmingly clear image. The same actor, each time at a washroom sink, introduces himself as a worker, a student, an engineer. As an engineer, carrying a vacuum cleaner in one hand and a machine gun in the other, he says, \"I am an engineer and I work for an electrical corporation. The workers think we produce vacuum cleaners. The students think we make machine guns. This vacuum cleaner can be a valuable weapon. This machine gun can be a useful household appliance. What we produce is the product of the workers, students, and engineers.\"", "title": "HARUN FAROCKI : INEXTINGUISHABLE FIRE - subtitled", "publishedDate": "2011-03-22T09:18:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LCExiSoJfQ", "description": "http://romanticmissions.com/2013/12/09/tlc-day-25-dust-it-off/\n\nTime to pick myself up from the ground, dust it off and keep moving forward.\n\nPs.

It contains a combination of atropine, hyoscyamine and hycosine. The herb has been used as a pain-killer, and especially for treating the symptoms of tooth decay. The normally astute naturalist John Ray described its use in 1660: \"The seed of Hyoscyamus placed on a coal gives off a smoke with a very unpleasant smell: when passed through the mouth and nostrils by a tube it drives out small worms (vermiculi) which sometimes grow in the nostrils or the teeth. They can be caught in a basin of water so that they can be seen better.\" The existence of these worms is attested by several other authorities, but dismissed by John Gerard, who described henbane-administering dentists as \"mountibancke tooth-drawers\". (See Roy Vickery, The Oxford Dictionary of Plant Lore, pp. 177-178.) Henbane was a common ingredient in witches' flying ointments. Storms could be raised by throwing some of the plant into boiling water. The incense recipe for raising spirits of the night is cited by Jon Hyslop and Paul Ratcliffe, A Folk Herbal, Radiation Publications, Oxford, 1989, p. 15. \"To be rid of them\", they add, \"burn Asafetida and Frankincense.\"", "title": "Henbane", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T20:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LChf6MKa-c", "description": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Analytical Song: Pecking Party", "title": "Pecking Party", "publishedDate": "2014-05-15T04:28:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LDGeBo1zMM", "description": "EVO 2013 Semi Finals: SSF4 AE Infiltration (Ryu) vs Kazunoko (Yun)", "title": "EVO 2K13: SSF4 AE Infiltration (Ryu) vs Kazunoko (Yun) [HD]", "publishedDate": "2013-07-13T04:47:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LDVbdPRA3k", "description": "Jonathan Fritzen's Spaghettini Debut in Seal Beach, California!!!", "title": "Jonathan Fritzen Spaghettini Debut, June 24th, \"Fly Away\"!!!", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T15:48:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LDniIVCWf0", "description": "Fantastic Voyage - WIP", "title": "Gametophyte model test", "publishedDate": "2014-04-09T16:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LE1p9LL-ZY", "description": "Learn how to prepare chicken for Spanish chicken fricassee with expert cooking tips in this free Spanish cuisine video clip.\n\nExpert: Liz Muller\nContact: lizshairdesign.com\nBio: Liz Muller is the owner of Liz's Hair Design in Hollywood, Fla., who has been a professional hair designer and color specialist since the mid 1980s.\nFilmmaker: Paul Muller", "title": "How to Make Spanish Chicken Fricass\u00e9e : Preparing Chicken for Spanish Chicken Fricassee", "publishedDate": "2008-02-01T09:12:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LECCD5A4tY", "description": "There are two uploads of this tune.

Tractor is running @ 2000 RPM. Click \"show more\" for more details v.\n\nThread here: http://www.tractorbynet.com/forums/kubota-owning-operating/221524-l-series-jerky-3-point.html\n\nAcceptably smooth action, with control granularity of about 1/4\". I will post additional videos in the future to show how finely i can bump up the 3PH. \n\nBackground:\n\nBought a used L3400. The 3PH was so jerky and violent, the tractor was pretty much unusable. Did a bit of experimenting and came to 2 conclusions. \n1. Hydraulic flow rate to the cylinder is too high for the system design.\n2. The control valve is not adequately damped, doesn't respond proportionally and requires too much of a delta (set point to feedback) to respond. This caused the hitch to jump an inch at a time, with a violently angry abrupt jump.\n\nPosition Control Valve is the part # YR909-00100 which is one of the more notoriously bad ones.\n\nWhat it used to look like:\n(other people's links - but mine was at least as bad, maybe worse)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSTJrL6AwYg\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fsjf6xNqZM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS5VN8McI2Y\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WACO5_bWTmc\n\nWhat I did:\n\n1. Reduced the flow to 3PH position control valve by diverting some of the flow after the FEL back to tank. Used a pressure compensated flow controller. \nhttp://tinyurl.com/6g5adj2\nhttp://tinyurl.com/64qcyd9\n\nI plumbed this flow controller in to be fed from the power beyond port of the FEL contol valve and its outlet supplying to the 3PH, while the excess flow goes back to tank. The nice thing is that the valve is flow adjustable (hence 3PH cylinder rate) and is pressure compensated (3PH lift capacity is not reduced). Note that this valve has absolutely no effect on FEL operation, capacity or speed. \n\n2. I disassembled the position control valve and chamfered the control edges of the main spool by 200um. These small chamfers reduce the \"dead zone\" of the control valve and make the valve far more responsive to small lever changes. In short, the lever doesn't need to be moved such that the hitch jumps 1\" at a time to catch up to the difference. In the active region, the hitch now jumps ~1/4\" (at most) at the time. Also, a chamfered flow in on the spool smooths out the initial flow of a given motion.\n\nThe tradeoff:\n\nMax Lift speed is traded for smoothness of operation. However, what I like about this solution is that the pressure compensated flow control is fully adjustable. I can change the setting on the fly depending on the work I am doing. If I bump up the flow, it will get faster, but it will also start to look jerkier.", "title": "Kubota L3400 - 3PH Action @ 2000 RPM", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T06:27:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LLXNACin70", "description": "Holocaust Memorial - Berlin.

It is found in forests and woodlands in the western Amazon Basin and disjunctly in the Atlantic forests in eastern Brazil. It has distinct white scaling/spotting on the lower neck and chest, but otherwise it resembles other chachalcas, it being vaguely pheasant-like (though far more arboreal and social), and with an overall brown plumage.\nSeveral taxa here included as subspecies of the Speckled Chachalaca have been considered valid species instead; the Scaled Chachalaca (O. squamata Lesson, 1829) in south-eastern Brazil, and the East Brazilian Chachalaca (O. araucuan Spix, 1825) in eastern Brazil. The last of these has also been referred to as the Brazilian Chachalaca or the White-bellied Chachalaca, although the former arguably is problematic as numerous other chachalacas are found in Brazil, while the latter leads to easy confusion with the Central American Ortalis leucogastra. Alternatively, araucuan and squamata have been included as subspecies of the Little Chachalaca[1] (the connection between the Guiana Shield and Atlantic forest is known from several other birds, e.g. the Buff-throated Woodcreeper and the Yellow-green Grosbeak). Both araucuan and squamata were originally described as valid species, but -- without reason -- changed to subspecies of O. guttata. Nevertheless, they all have white scaling/spotting on the lower neck and chest, thus resembling the Amazonian nominate group (incl. subaffinis), and most recent authorities continue to treat all as subspecies of O. guttata. The Colombian Chachalaca (O. columbiana Hellmayr, 1906) was formerly considered a subspecies in this group, but is now recognized as a separate species by the South American Classification Committee of the AOU and the IOC.", "title": "#13c Fleckenguan, Speckled Chachalaca, Ortalis guttata - Birdwatching in Peru", "publishedDate": "2011-03-16T11:51:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Lcv30LDUDM", "description": "Nova navija\u010dka pjesma za potporu hrvatske reprezentacije na euru 2008!", "title": "Nova Navija\u010dka - AJMO HRVATSKA  grupa ( SEDMI VAL ) 2008.", "publishedDate": "2008-04-19T16:30:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LcwafD7xmg", "description": "", "title": "Kathleen Edwards - Back to Me.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-04-28T15:30:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LdDGEfSz9c", "description": "ZAM\u00d3W P\u0141YT\u0118 za 26PLN (w tym koszt wysy\u0142ki): http://tuneoftheyear.com\n\nSUBSKRYBUJ DWAEM MUSIC:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=DwaemMusic\n\nSUBSKRYBUJ FACEBOOK \u0141OZO AKA PITAHAYA:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lozoakapitahaya\n\nLIRYCS:\nref (x2)\nGdy m\u00f3wimy o nich, m\u00f3wimy szeptem\nBo oni, s\u0105 symbolem ludzkich nieszcz\u0119\u015b\u0107\nOni, maj\u0105 si\u0142\u0119 cho\u0107 przegrali sporo\nTo pr\u00f3buj\u0105 oddycha\u0107 nie zalewaj\u0105c si\u0119 sol\u0105\n\n[Bunio]\nPrzejd\u017a czasem po ulicy, tam bohater\u00f3w nie brak\nWojownicy systemu zamkni\u0119ci w kopule z\u0142a\nMaj\u0105 sporo odwagi, \u017cycie ma dla nich smak\nIch serce nie zna granic cho\u0107 rytm przerywa p\u0142acz\nDzie\u0144 sam toczy si\u0119 dalej, tak od kilkunastu lat\nW chorobie w biedzie w b\u00f3lu, w wojnie co\u015b jest nie tak\nGdyby B\u00f3g chcia\u0142 im da\u0107 szcz\u0119\u015bcie spok\u00f3j i \u0142ad\nWyla\u0142by ludzk\u0105 mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 kiedy p\u0142on\u0105\u0142 Irak\nMy mamy przejebane bo z hajsem jest krucho; fakt\nAle popatrzcie na nich, nie wiedz\u0105 co to strach\nS\u0105 silniejsi cho\u0107 inni od krzy\u017ca zm\u0119czony bark\nMaj\u0105 wi\u0119cej sumienia, bo my mamy wi\u0119cej wad\nPostaw si\u0119 na ich miejscu, wejd\u017a w sk\u00f3r\u0119 pe\u0142n\u0105 ran\nZobaczysz jasne \u015bwiat\u0142o, nadzieja w ich oczach blask\nNie przejmuj\u0105 si\u0119 jutrem, ci\u0105g Syzyfowych prac\nNikt z nich nie chce by\u0107 l\u017cejszy o 21 gram\n\nref (x2)\nGdy m\u00f3wimy o nich, m\u00f3wimy szeptem\nBo oni, s\u0105 symbolem ludzkich nieszcz\u0119\u015b\u0107\nOni, maj\u0105 si\u0142\u0119 cho\u0107 przegrali sporo\nTo pr\u00f3buj\u0105 oddycha\u0107 nie zalewaj\u0105c si\u0119 sol\u0105\n\n[\u0141ozo aka Pitahaya]\nOdwracamy sw\u00f3j wzrok kiedy d\u0142o\u0144 nas zaczepia\nco krok spotykamy te strz\u0119py cz\u0142owieka \nTo jak letarg na pi\u0119tach historia odci\u015bni\u0119ta \nW r\u0119kach perfumeria pozwala niepami\u0119ta\u0107\nO przej\u015bciach, o kl\u0119skach, o snach kt\u00f3re budz\u0105\nW sercach wspomnienia co los zabra\u0142 ludziom\nG\u0142os nieba na ziemi, przykazaniom tak wierni\nSpluwaj\u0105 na moralno\u015b\u0107 dziewczyn przy arterii\nI co? \u015awiat podzieli\u0142 nas wed\u0142ug praw konsumpcji\nT\u0142umacz\u0105c indolencj\u0105 brak perspektyw u ludzi\nWypluci przez system z kt\u00f3rym wygra\u0107 si\u0119 nie da\nBogactwo rodzi wi\u0119cej patologii ni\u017c bieda\nTen letarg ich z\u017cera jak rak, nie ma przebacz\nBo smak fatalizmu zbiera plony po centralnych\nTu gardzi si\u0119 nimi, sami sobie winni karmy\nPogrzeba\u0107 marzenia, a nadzieja si\u0119 wypali - dla nich\n\nref (x2)\nGdy m\u00f3wimy o nich, m\u00f3wimy szeptem\nBo oni, s\u0105 symbolem ludzkich nieszcz\u0119\u015b\u0107\nOni, maj\u0105 si\u0142\u0119 cho\u0107 przegrali sporo\nTo pr\u00f3buj\u0105 oddycha\u0107 nie zalewaj\u0105c si\u0119 sol\u0105\n\n\nMusic by \u0141ozo aka Pitahaya of album \"Mi\u0119dzy Ziemi\u0105 a Niebem\".

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year. It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites, Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September -- 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, Nowr\u016bz was officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\n--\n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\nOther items on the table may include: * Sonbol - Hyacinth (plant) * Sekkeh - Coins - representative of wealth * traditional Iranian pastries such as baghlava, toot, naan-nokhodchi * Aajeel - dried nuts, berries and raisins * lit candles (enlightenment and happiness) * a mirror (symbolizing cleanness and honesty) * decorated eggs, sometimes one for each member of the family (fertility) * a bowl of water with goldfish (life within life, and the sign of Pisces which the sun is leaving).

Other artists paid 2 pounds 30 shillings. Then again it was not a spruced-backed, maple-necked piece of craftsmanship -- it was a beat up old box!   \n\n1935 -- Age 10, Athol was playing piano at local dances. When he left school he worked on his father's farm and then as a farmhand on neighbouring properties. It was the guitar, the Tex Morton and Wilf Carter music that claimed his attention.\n\n1947 -- Age 22, his first break came when he was asked to sing on a radio program on 7AD Devonport. The program was on Tuesday nights and ran for three and a quarter years.\n\n1950 -- Moved to  Melbourne to expand his range of opportunities.  Won his heat of  Australia's Amateur Hour in 1950 and recorded for EMI.\n\n1951 -- Won the novelty section on the 'prestigious' radio show  P & A Parade.\n\nThis win brought him fairly constant work in radio and live performances but not a great deal of progress.\n\n1951-1958 -- He worked as a barman in Connell's  Railway Hotel.\n\n1956 -- He topped the poll on Terry Dear's  Australia's  Amateur Hour with over 10,000 votes.\n\nOn the strength of that success, he went to  Sydney for an audition with Regal Zonophone and was accepted. The first track he recorded Wilf Carter's 'Swiss Moonlight Lullaby' and his own composition 'Tassie Tears'. The recordings made him the first Tasmanian to sing from the magic grooves! Sales warranted more records.\n\n1956 & 1958 -- Puts down 4 additional tracks each year.\n\nAn outcome of the recording contract was an offer of a promotional tour of eastern states on Noel George's 'Australian Wild West Show'. The show also featured American Indian Wrestler Big Chief Little Wolf. Other tours for Athol at this time were also with the 'Reg Lindsay Show, Chad Morgan and Rick and Thel Shows'.\n\n1961 -- By the time he organised his own travelling show the best days for this type of entertainment had passed on the mainland. They were hard times for travelling shows. Nearly all the shows went bust. Athol headed back to  Tasmania.\n\n1966 -- Athol toured full time again.  He teamed up with his boyhood idol 'Tex Morton' with a show called The Morton's and McCoy's\n\nThe tour started in Morven QLD, through to the Isa, across to Alice Springs, back through the settlements to  Darwin where they did a three-week season showing nightly, across the  Kimberley's down to  Western Australia and across the Nullarbor.\n\nAfter the  Tex shows ended, he toured with Terry Gordon, Ray Haselar Lindsay Butler and others.\n\nBack in  Sydney he recorded for RCA with Eileen Wood on fiddle who also toured with him and then became Mrs Athol McCoy\".\n\n1969 -- At the end of the year, he had a break from touring and gained a job with the Reserve Bank in  Melbourne.\n\n1972-1973 -- He made his last tour of  Australia.\n\n1973 -- Hadley Records in  Tamworth acquired the rights to most of Athol's recorded output and issued an album of his work.\n\nAthol and Eileen settled in Bega NSW and had their own business.

Curators say that in recent weeks they noticed that the statue inexplicably was turned to odd angles, although the display case is secured against anyone accessing it.\n\nA video camera was set up to monitor the statuette, and when time-lapsed the video showed the statuette turning autonomously in its case.\n\nThe statuette dates back to 1,800 BC and was originally discovered inside a tomb as an offering to the Egyptian god Osiris. An inscription on it asks for \"bread, beer and beef.\" For more than 80 years, the 25 centimetre statue, the relic of a man called Neb-Senu, has been housed in the museum without being seen to turn in circles.\n\nAncient Egyptian belief maintained that when the mummy that a statuette was meant to accompany was destroyed, the statuette could be used by the spirit as a vessel. However scientists offer a different explanation. Anna Garnett, and egyptologist at the Manchester Museum explained, \"None of these other statuettes move whatsoever and neither do the small perspex cubes which are in front of them, so if it's vibration how can that be explained? We had Professor Brian Cox come and look at the statuette and also some of the video footage of the statuette moving. He suggests it might be down to some kind of differential friction.\"\n\nCox's theory is that friction between the statuette and the glass shelf supporting it, awakened when visitors are in the museum, causes the statue to move.", "title": "UK: Statuette scares museum as it spins like an Egyptian", "publishedDate": "2013-06-25T09:59:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LqTFeo-CYE", "description": "", "title": "My sons' breakfast", "publishedDate": "2013-03-31T10:34:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2LqomUhmlpI", "description": "filmed in 1992. this is Maelstrom in Epcot at Disney world.

With his deep, resonant baritone and spare, percussive guitar, he had a basic, distinctive sound. Cash didn't sound like Nashville, nor did he sound like honky tonk or rock & roll. He created his own subgenre, falling halfway between the blunt emotional honesty of folk, the rebelliousness of rock & roll, and the world weariness of country. Cash's career coincided with the birth of rock & roll, and his rebellious attitude and simple, direct musical attack shared a lot of similarities with rock. However, there was a deep sense of history -- as he would later illustrate with his series of historical albums -- that kept him forever tied with country. And he was one of country music's biggest stars of the '50s and '60s, scoring well over 100 hit singles.\n\nCash was born and raised in Arkansas, moving to Dyess when he was three. By the time he was 12 years old, he had begun writing his own songs. He was inspired by the country songs he had heard on the radio. While he was in high school, he sang on the Arkansas radio station KLCN. Cash graduated from college in 1950, moving to Detroit to work in an auto factory for a brief while. With the outbreak of the Korean War, he enlisted in the Air Force. While he was in the Air Force, Cash bought his first guitar and taught himself to play. He began writing songs in earnest, including \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" Cash left the Air Force in 1954, married a Texas woman named Vivian Leberto, and moved to Memphis, where he took a radio announcing course at a broadcasting school on the GI Bill. During the evenings, he played country music in a trio that also consisted of guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. The trio occasionally played for free on a local radio station, KWEM, and tried to secure gigs and an audition at Sun Records.\n\nCash finally landed an audition with Sun Records and its founder, Sam Phillips, in 1955. Initially, Cash presented himself as a gospel singer, but Phillips turned him down. Phillips asked him to come back with something more commercial. Cash returned with \"Hey Porter,\" which immediately caught Phillips' ear. Soon, Cash released \"Cry Cry Cry\"/\"Hey Porter\" as his debut single for Sun. On the single, Phillips billed Cash as \"Johnny,\" which upset the singer because he felt it sounded too young; the record producer also dubbed Perkins and Grant as the Tennessee Two. \"Cry Cry Cry\" became a success upon its release in 1955, entering the country charts at number 14 and leading to a spot on The Louisiana Hayride, where he stayed for nearly a year. A second single, \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" reached the country Top Five in early 1956 and its follow-up, \"I Walk the Line,\" was number one for six weeks and crossed over into the pop Top 20.\n\nCash had an equally successful year in 1957, scoring several country hits including the Top 15 \"Give My Love to Rose.\" Cash also made his Grand Ole Opry debut that year, appearing all in black where the other performers were decked out in flamboyant, rhinestone-studded outfits. Eventually, he earned the nickname of \"The Man in Black.\" Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album in November of 1957, when Johnny Cash With His Hot and Blue Guitar hit the stores. Cash's success continued to roll throughout 1958, as he earned his biggest hit, \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\" (number one for ten weeks), as well another number one single, \"Guess Things Happen That Way.\" For most of 1958, Cash attempted to record a gospel album, but Sun refused to allow him to record one. Sun also was unwilling to increase Cash's record royalties. Both of these were deciding factors in the vocalist's decision to sign with Columbia Records in 1958. By the end of the year, he had released his first single for the label, \"All Over Again,\" which became another Top Five success. Sun continued to release singles and albums of unissued Cash material into the '60s.\n\n\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town,\" Cash's second single for Columbia, was one of his biggest hits, reaching the top of the country charts and crossing over into the pop charts in the beginning of 1959. Throughout that year, Columbia and Sun singles vied for the top of the charts. Generally, the Columbia releases -- \"Frankie's Man Johnny,\" \"I Got Stripes,\" and \"Five Feet High and Rising\" -- fared better than the Sun singles, but \"Luther Played the Boogie\" did climb into the Top Ten. That same year, Cash had the chance to make his gospel record -- Hymns by Johnny Cash -- which kicked off a series of thematic albums that ran into the '70s.", "title": "Tennessee Flat Top Box", "publishedDate": "2008-08-28T17:54:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "2M0D9tHSVh8", "description": "", "title": "A Sustainable Growth Strategy for Mitigating Financial Crises  Broadening Capital Acquisition with t", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T07:07:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2M0FJrZNtEo", "description": "Upload to 2014/07/18", "title": "2015 Livin' Lite 8.4S Camp Lite Truck Camper with Slide only 2,400 Pounds!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T20:19:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2M0LDiK2QFA", "description": "Virgilia Singh, Bloomberg Businessweek fellow and founder of What's On Your Plate, shares what she's learned from Sandbox Network and talks about the evolution of business from a one-way offering of services to an exchange of resources and ideas.

Because it is negatively charged, GFP will bind to the positively charged anion exchange resin.\n\nThe pump draws the lysate from the vessel...past the first conductivity sensor and pressure sensor...and through the zero-point-four-five micron pre-filter.  The pre-filter removes any residual cell debris or other particulates that may have contaminated the solution.\n\nIf the pre-filter begins to clog, the pressure sensor at the inlet side of the filter will register a rising pressure...and the controller will signal the need for a filter change.\n\nAfter pre-filtering and before the column, the lysate passes through a flow meter...\nand an air sensor.  Then, as the lysate passes over the resin beads, the negatively charged protein attaches to the positively charged beads.\n\nThe solution leaving the column passes a UV optical density sensor, a conductivity sensor and a pH sensor.

The finding of a dilated kidney on sonography may suggest the presence of obstruction lower downstream within the ureter. The advantage of ultrasonography is that it avoids the exposure to radiation. The disadvantage, as mentioned above, lies in its inability to follow the course of the small and often tortuous ureters.", "title": "MY LIVER ITS FREE!!!
