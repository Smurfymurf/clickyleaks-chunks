Cork, Ireland. His first real connection to music was watching an unplugged Nirvana covering Bowies The Man Who Sold the World. After a stint in a music college in Cork, he travelled to the U.S. where he wandered around for a few years. While there, he entered the U.S. Songwriting Competition in Nashville, Tennessee and, to his surprise, won two top awards for his compositions.\n\nIf asked, Mick adamantly refuses to talk about himself. The best you'll get from him on any given day is, maybe, an admission that he's a bit grumpy, he enjoys a good game of poker, and he'd love to own a Gibson.\n\nSo, if you're determined to get up close and personal with Mick Flannery, you're gonna have to kick back and listen to his music because thats where he actually talks about himself. Mick writes all of his songs (words and music) and plays both piano and guitar.\n\nMick Flannery is a singing and songwriting force to be reckoned with - Siobh\u00e1n Long, Irish Times\n\nMick is a songwriter of the first order  His voice is pained, gravelly, and powerful. Recorded or live, it carries through and stops you in your tracks - Urban Folk, New York\n\nhttp://www.mickflannery.com/\n\nAlso check out - \n\nBALCONYTV LONDON\nhttp://www.balconytv.com/london\n\nBALCONYTV HAMBURG\nhttp://www.balconytv.com/hamburg\n\nTune in again tomorrow!!!", "title": "MICK FLANNERY - WISH YOU WELL (BalconyTV)", "publishedDate": "2008-11-21T13:25:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2M9zLUOQqnk", "description": "Most of my videos are comedy, but this one is just a helpful tip on how to froth milk for your coffee.

The stages of living between these events: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, parenthood and senior are themselves natural and in accord with the needs of the species and most individuals. Many find their satisfaction in living this course and to these individuals I have little or nothing to say. Others though long for something more; something innate, genetic and seemingly calling. Adventure and change can give a degree of satisfaction and relief yet even these may seem too tame. To those who feel drawn to something beyond the entertainment and stimulation of senses I offer a walk along The Path of Wildness. Don't bother penciling the event in your schedule, preparing a pack with goodies and supplies or even inviting a friend along, for this experience is along the course of your first inclination and you must surely always go alone.\n\nLearn more about The Path of Wildness here:\nhttp://wp.me/P5A2F-As\n\n====\n\nCHANNEL CREDITS\n\n\"Japanese Falls\" image by the artist Lane Brown.

It thus affirms the truth and righteousness of every prophet. Prophets have been sent for particular peoples at particular times in history to guide them to Allah. The Holy Prophet was the last law-bearing prophet and the message of Islam thus encompasses and supercedes all previous scriptures. Prophethood continues but only within Islam; prophets now appear so as to reflect the light of the Holy Prophet, and do not bring a new law.\n\nThe Holy Quran has described not only the positive aspect of prophethood; it also portrays the character of the opposition raised against all prophets. Pharaoh is the Quranic symbol of the forces opposed to every prophet.\n\n22: 76. ALLAH chooses HIS Messengers from among angels and from among men. Surely, ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.\n\n16: 37. And WE did raise among every people a Messenger with the teaching, `Worship ALLAH and shun the Evil one.' Then among them were some whom ALLAH guided and among them were some who became deserving of ruin. So travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who treated the prophets as liars !\n\n2: 31. And when thy Lord said to the angels, `I am about to place a vicegerent in the earth,' they said `Wilt THOU place therein such as will cause disorder in it, and shed blood ? - and we glorify THEE with THY praise and extol THY holiness,' HE answered, `I know what you know not.'\n\n4:164. Surely, WE have sent revelation to thee, as WE sent revelation to Noah and the Prophets after him; and WE sent revelation to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and his children and to Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and WE gave David a Book.\n\n4:165. And WE sent some Messengers whom WE have already mentioned to thee and some Messengers whom WE have not mentioned to thee - and to Moses ALLAH spoke at great length -\n\n2:125. And remember when his Lord tried Abraham with certain commandments which he fulfilled, HE said, `I will make thee a leader of men.' Abraham asked, `And from among my offspring ?' God said, `MY covenant does not embrace the transgressors.'\n\n2: 88. And verily WE gave Moses the Book and caused Messengers to follow in his footsteps after him; and to Jesus, son of Mary, WE gave manifest Signs, and strengthened him with the Spirit of Holiness. Will you, then, every time a Messenger comes to you with what you yourselves desire not, behave arrogantly and treat some as liars and slay others ?\n\nhttp://www.alislam.org/quran/HolyQuran/articles/00000033.html", "title": "KALIMAH ALLAH : NABI TERAKHIR PEMBAWA SYARIAT", "publishedDate": "2012-09-10T23:34:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MSqNR3BIcM", "description": "Subscribe to the Fact of the Day channel! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FactOfTheDay\nFollow the Fact team on Twitter! https://twitter.com/NewFactOfTheDay\n\"Like\" us on Facebook! http://facebook.com/OfficialFactOfTheDay\n__________________________________________\nFind today's host online, Jim Chapman!\nhttp://youtube.com/j1mmyb0bba\nhttp://youtube.com/vlogswithjim\nhttp://twitter.com/jimstweetings\nhttp://facebook.com/OfficialJimChapman\n__________________________________________\nThe \"Fact of the Day\" Crew!\n\nLuke: \nhttp://youtube.com/Luke\nhttp://youtube.com/LukeConard\nhttp://twitter.com/LukeConard\nhttp://facebook.com/LukeConard2\n\nIngrid: \nhttp://youtube.com/Missglamorazzi\nhttp://youtube.com/thegridmonster\nhttp://twitter.com/Missglamorazzi\nhttp://facebook.com/Missglamorazzi\n\nJoey:\nhttp://youtube.com/Joeygraceffa\nhttp://youtube.com/Joeygraceffagames\nhttp://twitter.com/Joeygraceffa\nhttp://www.facebook.com/JoeyGraceffaFANS\n\nFleur:\nhttp://youtube.com/FleurDeForce\nhttp://youtube.com/FleurDeVlog\nhttp://twitter.com/FleurDeForce\nhttp://www.facebook.com/fleurdeforce1\n\nJim:\nhttp://youtube.com/j1mmyb0bba\nhttp://youtube.com/vlogswithjim\nhttp://twitter.com/jimstweetings\nhttp://facebook.com/OfficialJimChapman\n\nTanya:\nhttp://youtube.com/pixi2woo\nhttp://youtube.com/tanyasvlogsandhauls\nhttp://twitter.com/tanyaburr\nhttp://facebook.com/OfficialTanyaBurr\n\nAlex:\nhttp://youtube.com/AlexanderCarpenter\nhttp://youtube.com/AlexCarpenterTwo\nhttp://twitter.com/alexcarpenter\nhttp://facebook.com/AlexCarpenterMusic\n\nLandon:\nhttp://youtube.com/LandonAustin\nhttp://youtube.com/LandonAustin2\nhttp://twitter.com/LandonAustin\nhttp://facebook.com/LandonAustinMusic\n\nPeter:\nhttp://youtube.com/PeterHollens\nhttp://youtube.com/PeterHollens2\nhttps://twitter.com/peterhollens\nhttp://www.facebook.com/PeterHollensMusic\n\n_______________________________________________\nIntro / Outro graphics by: http://youtube.com/ElementalistDesign\nEmail: info@elementalistdesign.com\nEdited by: http://youtube.com/TheForeverFilmers", "title": "\"Willm Shakspere, William Shakespeare?\" - Jim's History Fact of the Day!", "publishedDate": "2013-03-12T19:32:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MSqNkesstA", "description": "Babbs can be rude", "title": "Calling Babbs", "publishedDate": "2009-01-02T17:40:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MTRLmQT4VM", "description": "Red Montipora Capricornus", "title": "Red Montipora Capricornus", "publishedDate": "2008-03-29T09:55:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MTtfUf_jr4", "description": "video registrato nei pressi della borgata finocchio, dove io e mio cugino simone abbiamo incontrato il famossissimo AIUTTTOOOO hahah ke matto XD", "title": "aiutooo !raffaele borgata finocchio", "publishedDate": "2011-09-25T11:51:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MTw31WZfvA", "description": "\"The new sound of silence\" - The Walther LGV was launched in 2012 with the slogan \"The new sound of silence\".

The repetitive work can cause cramping.-\n\nEver wanted to make a tail but can't afford the fur? Don't own a sewing machine? Don't have enough money to buy a tail? Then make one out of yarn! Yarn is cheap and easy to get. Because of how a yarn tail is made, it is very soft, and very waggy and fun!\n\nI apologize for there being no sound. I couldn't find a short-yet-good enough song for the video, haha.\n\n-FAQ-\n\n\"How long does it take to make these?\"\nDepends on the size. You can make a small stub tail in 2 hours, but a longer and thicker tail could take up a lot of time; between 2-7 days, also depending on how many breaks you need to take.\n\n\"How much yarn is used?\"\nA LOT. If you're going to make an especially big tail, I recommend stocking up on the colors you want. Get the big rolls, unless you don't plan using a lot of one color.\n\n\"Do you sell these? How much are they?\"\nYup, I indeed make and sell yarn tails as a hobby. I sell them for $10 USD every 6 inches ($20 each foot), +$10 for shipping ($20 for shipping internationally). That would mean that if you got a tail that was 3 feet long and you wanted it shipped to NYC, it would cost $70, including the shipping.\n\n\"Do you give away free tails? Do you take art trades? DA points?\"\nNo, no, and no. These tails are WAY too much work to just give out willy-nilly. I understand you may be as broke as I am, but I'm really dependent on money at the moment and I cannot afford to give things I work hard on away.\n\n\"Have you figured out a hook technique?\"\nYup! Instead of spending more money on hard-to-find good hooks, I instead turned one of the top parts of the braid into a belt loop! How I did so was I just didn't add it to the twisting of the braid and let it get just big enough to fit a thick belt. It's actually experimental, but it's worth a shot (and much cheaper).\n\n\"What's the towel for?\"\nIt's to make the brushing easier. I recommend using an old rag though, because the brush will tear at it. This is also why I do not use the brush on my pants. I've ruined a couple pairs of pants by doing this :c", "title": "How to Make a Yarn Tail.", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T02:58:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MYkElecACU", "description": "serenada for chamber ensemble", "title": "Pavel Josef Vejvanovsky - Serenada", "publishedDate": "2008-02-20T05:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2MYqsEcU7ps", "description": "Le 5 Juin 2011, \"Entrez dans la danse\" pr\u00e9sente  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Werl\u00e9, danseur et chor\u00e9graphe de la la Compagine Iritis, lors de la 8\u00e8me \u00e9dition de la F\u00eate de la danse \u00e0 Paris et en Ile-de-France.

This story can mean to you whatever you want it to, since there isn't many characters/solid senarios. But here is the story that I think it is:\nKenna is sad (from reasons that you can interpret for yourself). As she is crying, she has a vision of a happier version of herself. She is in a beautiful sundress (as the title of the song suggests), and is happily enjoying her life. This vision is so joyful to Kenna that she is inspired to be more positive. She wipes her tears, and the next day, she heads out the door and carries herself through life with confidence.\nIf you've ever felt down or sad, shift your outlook on life. Keep a positive attitude, and you will enjoy yourself much more.

The molecule was first discovered in 1845, but did not receive FDA approval until 1978. Today it is known as the \"penicillin of cancer drugs,\" because it is so effective for many different cancers. There are three key players involved in Cisplatin's mechanism: (1) Cisplatin, (2) DNA (3) and an HMG Protein. Most Cisplatin enters the body through active transport, but some molecules are passively defused through the cell membrane. Once in the nucleus, Cisplatin can form an adduct with two consecutive guanine bases within a strand of DNA. The molecule loses its chlorine atoms in exchange for the nitrogen atoms of the target guanines. Cisplatin can bond more tightly with nitrogen because nitrogen balances the platinum charge more effectively than chlorine. It is this adduct-induced DNA bend that allows binding of proteins which contain the high mobility group, HMG domain. Once the protein is bound to the DNA, it inserts a wedge-like phenyl group of phenylalanine 37 into the widened minor groove created by the bend. The tightly bound HMG protein causes destacking of the nucleotide bases, resulting in the DNA helix becoming kinked. In this way, Cisplatin can be thought of as a monkey wrench in the DNA repair system. With the HMG protein bound to the DNA, the modified strand is not repaired properly and so the cell dies. The success of Cisplatin depends on its ratio of efficacy between cancerous and healthy cells. \n\nCreated by Nicholas O'Brien (Technical Consultant); Bongsup Cho (Professor of Pharmacy).\n\nAll credit given to URIAnimation. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq_up2uQRDo", "title": "Cisplatin Edited Version That Most People Will Never Find", "publishedDate": "2011-05-30T17:17:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Mkg9t4g0Nw", "description": "VIDEO LINK = http://youtu.be/2Mkg9t4g0Nw\n\u0417\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c. \u0414., \u0421\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0421.\u0412., \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041d. \u0411., \u041b\u0430\u043f\u0430 \u041e.\u041c., \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0413. \u041d.,  \u0413\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0417. \u0421., \u0421\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0421.\u0412., \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448 \u041e. \u0412., \u0411\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0422.\u041d.  \u041a\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c. - \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432, \u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u043e\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0434, \u0422\u041e\u0412 \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430, 2007, 48 \u0441.

Their parents, who were deeply religious and belonging to the \"First Church of God\", taught them to sing hymns and gospel music. A neighbour taught Bill how to play guitar and banjo while Earl on the other hand learned to play mandolin and guitar. Eventually, they decided to switch instruments and Bill chose the mandolin while Earl concentrated on the guitar. They made their radio debut in 1935 at local radio station WWNC in Asheville, North Carolina as part of the \"Crazy Hickory Nuts\". Sponsored by the \"J. F. Goodson Coffee Company and together with Homer Sherrill of the \"Crazy Hickory Nuts\" they formed the \"Good Coffee Boys\" in the late 1935. Six months later, in June 1936, the Bolick brothers moved to Atlanta, Georgia to perform at radio station WGST. Because they were sponsored by the \"Crazy Water Crystal\", they had to perform using the name \"(Crazy) Blue Ridge Hillbillies\".\nIn Atlanta, the Bolick brothers went to RCA Records for an audition. At first, Eli Oberstein, the A & R man was reluctant to hear the brothers sing accusing them of copying theMonroe Brothers. Anyhow, he changed his mind when he heard them sing and immediately signed them a recording contract. A discussion arose concerning what they should call themselves. Since they couldn't use the previous name \"the Blue Ridge Hillbillies\" - it had been taken by Homer Sherrill when the brothers left WGST - they decided to use \"Blue Sky Boys\" as their name. Their choice of name came from the nickname of western North Carolina: \"Land of the Blue Sky\".\nThey made their first recordings in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 16, 1936. Their first record \"Sunny Side of Life\" coupled with \"Where the Soul Never Dies\" became an instant success. It sold so fast the brothers were dubbed \"The New Hillbilly Kings. Between 1937 and 1941 the group recorded about 100 songs for RCA to considerable success on thehillbilly music circuit. Between 1941 and 1946 both brothers served in the military; after their discharge they returned to Atlanta and resumed recording with RCA. Some of their sides featured fiddle playing, from Leslie Keith, Sam Parker, Joe Tyson and Richard Hicks. They enjoyed a number of hits just after the war, but disliked the burgeoning honky tonkstyle and refused to record it. When RCA asked them to play with an electric guitar, they refused and stopped recording until 1949. Due to personal issues, the Blue Sky Boys retired in 1951.\nBill became a postal clerk in his birth state and Earl took a job at Lockheed Aircraft in Atlanta. It was not until 1962, when Starday Records released an LP of their radio recordings, that they decided to reunite and record again. Two LPs of new material followed, one secular (Together Again) and one religious (Precious Moments). They occasionally played live at folk festivals; Capitol Records recorded one of these, at the UCLA Folk Festival, and released it as an album. But by the end of the 1960s they had decided to call it quits again.\nOnce more, in 1975, they were convinced to record again, this time for Rounder Records, and another round of folk and bluegrass circuit touring ensued. Following this Bill moved back to his birthplace and lived in Longview NC and Earl retired to Tucker, Georgia.\nIn the 1990s, Copper Creek Records issued a series of four albums with live radio transcriptions from the 1940s.\nDiscography\n\u2022 Together Again, 1963 (Starday)\n\u2022 Precious Moments, 1964 (Starday)\n\u2022 Presenting the Blue Sky Boys, 1966 (Capitol)\n\u2022 Sunny Side of Life, 1973 (Rounder)\n\u2022 The Blue Sky Boys, 1976 (Rounder)\n\u2022 The Blue Sky Boys (2 record set), 1976 (Bluebird)\n\u2022 In Concert 1964, 1989 (Rounder\n\u2022 On Radio Vol 1 - 4 (4 volumes), 1996-97 (Copper Creek)\n\u2022 Farm & Fun Time Favorites Vol 1 - 2 (2 volumes), 1996 (Copper Creek)\n\nSpotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/12bkk7kVWRaukf3zwqPtOu\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/turn-your-radio-on/id729269275\n\nS\u00edguenos en:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es\nSpotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic\nWeb: http://www.vintagemusic.es\nBoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra f\u00edsica de CD)", "title": "The Blue Sky Boys -- Asleep in the Briny Deep", "publishedDate": "2013-11-07T12:51:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NBi-TkQgZM", "description": "", "title": "Mary MacGregor - Torn Between Two Lovers - Karaoke", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T02:15:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NCDYjHtEcU", "description": "When Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy hit the range, no cup is safe.", "title": "No Cup Is Safe", "publishedDate": "2013-01-14T15:14:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NCJs5NK7f8", "description": "John Cobra amenaza en un v\u00eddeo con matar a Pablo Iglesias.", "title": "John Cobra amenaza de muerte a Pablo Iglesias", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T19:20:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NCPau3jptM", "description": "http://www.newtrucksearch.com.au  We field-test the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter tipper truck.

It ran OK, but it frequently required filing the points, the occasional shot of ether, and the 6 volt system required a battery charge if it sat for more than a month.  To alleviate all of those problems, I swapped in an Onan diesel out of a military surplus MEP-002A generator set.  I bought the set for spare parts for several otherr -002A's and -003A's that I own; it had fallen off of a truck and took a tumble across a parking lot, so it was pretty banged up.

Nitrobacter Thomas Janardi melakukannya dengan pendekatan teknologi yang sederhana, praktis dan sama sekali berbeda dengan teknologi lain manapun di dunia.  Perang-perangan bakteri ! tepatnya memicu teror dan  \"Perang mikro-biologi\" di habitat kolam ikan. Prinsipnya sederhana, bakteri yang jumlahnya terbesar dia yang berkuasa ! Dan pastikan dosis yang tepat untuk nitrobacter menguasai dan mendominasi jumlah atas seluruh populasi bakteri di kolam. \nFenomena yang sangat menarik adalah ketika Ikan Mati tidak berbau, masih berlendir, dan tidak mengeras. Bukti bahwa Nitrobacter membuat macet bakteri-bakteri pembusuk di kolam Ikan. Anda bisa mengujinya dalam eksplorasi lebih lanjut dalam dunia pengawetan ikan tanpa es, hanya dengan memberangus bakteri pembusuk, awetlah di obyek karena bakteri pembusuknya Istirohat alias duduk manis karena \"takut\" akan dominiasi Nitrobacter. Dasar teori dari temuan ini bisa dilihat di internet =\"quorum sensing\", bakteri yang ternyata memiliki kemampuan berkomunikasi sebelum menyerang dan melakukan tindakan tertentu. Dengan dominiasi nitrobacter, komunikasi bakteri lain jenis akan menghasilkan sinyal \"bahaya\" karena kalah jumlah. Dan membuat bakteri lain memilih \"duduk manis\", diam , dormant (suri) atau mati.\nNitrobacter memiliki sifat An-Aerob sehingga tidak rebutan Oxigen dengan si ikan, memungkinkan aplikasi tanpa pompa udara, tanpa filter, tanpa kuras air.\nKalau ikan sehat-sehat saja, kenapa harus dan apa yang harus dikawatirkan ?? \nSystem Teror bakteri ,  inilah istilah baru yang tidak pernah kita dengar sebelumnya, terobosan teknologi ini sungguh luarbiasa dan suatu keniscayaan temuan ini akan mempunyai pengaruh  sangat besar terhadap usaha peternakan ikan di Indonesia dan dunia. Hingga video ini di upload, belum ada satupun teknologi yang mampu secara efektif mengatasi dampak efek negatif dari AMONIAK yang merupakan residu alami dari fases/kotoran ikan yang beracun.\nAnda dapat memesan Produk ini langsung ke formulatornya Bp.

Botulinum. \n\nThe scientific name for this bacterium is Clostridium Botulinum. It is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. C. Botulinum is an obligate anaerobe, meaning the only time it can produce neurotoxins during sporulation is in an environment that lacks oxygen. \n\nHuman botulism is a serious bacterial disease that is caused by the neurotoxins that are produced from C. Botulinum spores. These spores can be very dangerous because they are heat and acid resistant; this means the spores can lie dormant in most environments for long periods of time. Even though Clostridium Botulinum resides in soils and marine sediments around the world, their anaerobic state makes them much less threatening. When placed in an environment that lacks oxygen, pressure sterilization is a main way to kill these spores. \n\nClostridium Botulinum bacterium spores produce toxin types A, B, and E. Once these toxins and spores enter the body, they travel to the intestinal tract. This is because they can completely pass through the high acidity of the stomach without any complications. These toxins can create one of three types of botulism: foodborne, wound, and infant botulism. For foodborne and infant botulism, the bacteria and toxin enter the body through a food source; however, wound botulism can enter the body through a break in the skin. Once this chemical or physical barrier has been broken, the toxin absorbs into the blood and circulates the body. \n\nBotulism poisoning mainly occurs from the ingestion of foods that are improperly home-canned with a water activity higher than 0.8, are improperly preserved, or are from a food with a pH below 4.6 that did not go through correct preservation times and pressures.\n\nSymptoms from this poisoning can occur between 18 and 36 hours of ingestion. The main symptom of botulism is double vision. Other symptoms include blurred vision, drooping eyelids, muscle weakness, paralysis, slurred speech, and trouble with breathing. \n\nSerious botulism can result in respiratory failure and paralysis. One form of treatment requires a patient to be on a ventilator for weeks to months with intensive nursing and medical care. The paralysis that had resulted from botulism must completely improve on it\u2019s own before a patient could be prescribed an antitoxin. Once it is improved, this antitoxin treats Botulism. \n\n\nIf botulism is left untreated, the patient respiratory\u2019s system would fail, and their death would soon follow.\n\nOn average, 145 cases are reported each year. 65% are infant botulism; 15% are foodborne; and 20% are wound. There are no vaccines to prevent botulism from occurring, just preventative measures. If an outbreak of botulism does occur, the CDC works with the physicians treating the patient as quickly as possible. This bacterial disease is not a worldwide disease, and with new treatments, the outbreaks are very minimal and death percentages are at their all time low. \n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/ \n2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum#Clostridium_botulinum_in_different_geographical_locations \n3. http://www.who.int/csr/delibepidemics/clostridiumbotulism.pdf \n4. http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Botulism", "title": "Alexis Bahas, Botulism Video Project, Fall 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T19:47:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NRUdJdtZLY", "description": "Attempting to express the urinary bladder of a Male Brushtail Possum.\nlots of air, and a few squirts, most leaked into the lower abdomen due to the possum having an overfull bladder which had a small leak somewhere within.", "title": "Attempting to express the bladder of a Male Brushtail Possum", "publishedDate": "2008-12-03T18:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NRu_0DHh5M", "description": "", "title": "MotTex", "publishedDate": "2013-05-04T21:45:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NRwd-JJFm4", "description": "", "title": "Kekule s Dream", "publishedDate": "2011-02-19T22:10:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NS0gwEwgjE", "description": "Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals that comprise the family Cervidae. Species therein include white-tailed deer, such mule deer as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou) fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year, thereby differing from such permanently horned animals as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may be superficially similar. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded to be deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively. Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native species, the red deer, confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that fawn fawns deer like to eat. frog kitten kitty kitties kittens cute cuter cat cats feline felines adorable lovely love pet pets animal animals sweet nice catnip purr purrs purring milk pregnant pregnancy pregnancies puss pussy kittycat kittycats kit pussycat tail tails feed feeding milking mice hunt hunting play playing toy toys whisker whiskers cutest hair hairy fur furry catch playing pussycats litter litters outdoors outdoors urine meal meals scat litter box litter boxes things good bad weird strange odd fast calico calicos  Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive. Small species of brocket deer and pud\u00fas of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian Muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America's Andes fill an ecological niche of the ibex or wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids. The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn antelope", "title": "Brutal Deer Fight Between 2 Bucks", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T11:36:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NS_VHTMnZY", "description": "Tocando s\u00f3 na hd 4000 td com divisores certinho para driver e tuiter", "title": "2 MB 4.0 selenium", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T01:25:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NSeZ5QLCYI", "description": "Tema: ya no eres pan y vino - canto de comuni\u00f3n\nEste versi\u00f3n esta muy buena para inspirar y ense\u00f1arles un poco mas lo que est\u00e1n por recibir a nuestros chicos de primera comuni\u00f3n\nGracias a quien nos presto la vos xq nos llego al coraz\u00f3n y al padre Carlos que nos presto su imagen", "title": "ya no eres pan y vino \"con letra\"", "publishedDate": "2013-09-20T22:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NSepK5M1ew", "description": "\u00a9 2005 to Warner Bros.

The film was written and directed by David Leland. The original music score was composed by Stanley Myers.Sixteen-year-old Lynda Mansell (Emily Lloyd) lives in a small English seaside town in the early 1950s. She is feisty and precocious and always shocks other people with her vulgar and saucy tongue (her favourite insult is \"Up yer bum\"). She is also naive and easily taken advantage of. Bored with conventional jobs (which she frequently loses) and her town's dull young men, Lynda has her first sexual experience with Dave (Jesse Birdsall) but after she has slept with one of her father's middle-aged friends (Tom Bell), her life changes. She becomes pregnant and her father, a somewhat rigid and conventional man, disowns her. Desperately she tries to seek an illegal abortion but in the end decides to become a mother.\n\"Wish you were here\" is a sigh Lynda makes because of her dead mother, who understood her and protected her from her intolerant father. Beneath her cheeky exterior, Lynda is a vulnerable girl who seeks love and a place in life; she lives in a time when it was difficult for teenagers like her to do that in their own way.\nThis movie was based loosely on the memoirs of the British madam Cynthia Payne as an adolescent. It was filmed in Worthing and Bognor Regis.", "title": "Emily Lloyd Film - Wish You Were Here (1987 featuring accordionist Alan Young).", "publishedDate": "2012-10-22T11:29:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NUA3MEufu4", "description": "To see my Sea Salts Trial result click: http://youtu.be/I4fJM5PFsA4\nSee my Hydra Veil Review: http://youtu.be/7t66evGgjF8\nWatch my Egyptian Magic Cream review: http://youtu.be/skl_77azhng\nSee inside my Pro Makeup Zuca case:http://youtu.be/lPh5zz83kj8\n\nFollow me on\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BenDniprowskijStylist?ref=hl\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/bendniprowskijstylist\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BenDniprowskij\n\nSorry this took so long peeps..

Bollywood Actress Anjum Nayar finally arrested for threatening and abusing cops on duty.\n\n\nMUMBAI: Oshiwara police arrested a model-turned-actor, Anjum Nayar, for playing loud music at her flat early on Monday and abusing policemen who requested her to lower the noise. Nayar was initially let off with a fine, but was arrested later in the day after senior cops saw a video of her abusing the policemen who had gone to caution her. She will be produced before a local court on Tuesday.\n\nAround 1.30am on Monday, the police control room received a complaint from a resident at Samarth Aangan society, Oshiwara, about loud music being played at Nayar's flat. The complaint was passed on to Oshiwara police, following which two policemen went to her flat along with a building watchman, to warn her against disturbing others. However, Nayar turned aggressive when cautioned about the loud music and began abusing the cops.\n\nNair and her boyfriend, who was present in the flat, were taken to the police station and fined under different sections of the Maharashtra Police Act (earlier Bombay Police Act) for playing loud music and creating a nuisance. Once at the police station, Nair apologized to the cops for her rude behaviour and requested them not to act against her and said she had been upset with senior police officers who didn't help her to get her film released. She told police that she had acted in a movie but its producer was delaying the release. She claimed to have met senior police officials requesting them to put pressure on the producer, but was upset as they declined and vented her ire at the Oshiwara policemen.\n\nWhile she was let off after paying a fine, later on Monday, senior police officers saw a recording of Nair abusing the cops, which was made by a person on his mobile.", "title": "Warned for blaring out music, Bollywood Actress uses filthy cuss-words to abuse cops - Andry Kolor", "publishedDate": "2013-10-12T11:17:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NbxVGx3Wr8", "description": "Quality insulation issues associated with sealing thermal leaks to unconditioned attic", "title": "Seal thermal leaks to attic", "publishedDate": "2006-05-16T19:52:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Nc5VwNwv6k", "description": "In Inghilterra nel 1912, la famiglia Birling festeggia il proprio benessere finanziario e il fidanzamento della figlia Sheila con un giovane industriale.

Thanks to its improved active body controls, the Mercedes Benz CL63 AMG remained absurdly unaffected by the enormous lateral g-forces generated by its gyrations. Lacking suitable anti-gravity aids, my passenger and I were thrown towards the outer radius of the turn, welded to the CL63s seat bolsters. Now thats what I call fun.\n\nThe CL63 reminds me of the rockets I designed as a kid; the Merc's a massive, sleek shape punctuated by slits and evil looking slashes. Whereas the chop top CLS-Class seems more than a little forced, the CL63 makes perfect sense. Its athletic stance, gigantic wheel arches and aggressive surface effects combine to create a coupe that looks like it eats continents\u2014 and Porsches\u2014 for breakfast.\n\nThe CL63s rear is especially effective. Framed by a Batmobile-esque rippled valence, its quad pipes give the cars rear the kind of purposefulness denied BMWs overwrought 6-Series. While both cars have so much flame surfacing they could put Burger King out of business, its the big Merc that lets me have it my way. \n\nThe CL63s interior is a bit too staid for my taste/money. That said, Affalterbachs artisans add the requisite luxury touches, including rich, soft and dense leather and a sweet smelling Alcantara roof lining. The aforementioned seat bolsters provide an unwelcome awakening for first time users, before they learn to guide their bottoms trajectory with appropriate care and precision.\n\nMercedes COMAND system remains the most intuitive of Germanys multi-media controllers\u2014 which is a bit like saying Rocky III isnt quite as terrible as Rocky V. Tweaking the seat massage functions and adjusting the air flow from the HVAC from diffuse to focused is no great challenge. Not so the eight window controls; choosing the correct button to raise or lower one of the four windows is an ergonomic lottery.\n\nIm no great fan of the massive pods enclosing the CL63s speedometer and navigation systems. While I appreciate the aeronautic theme, theres too much dash for those of us who prefer visual flight rules. AMGs 200 mph speedometer is a suitably wicked touch (that violates the spirit of Germanys gentlemens agreements), but I find it hard to read. And despite exalted specifications, the CL63s stereo sounds disappointing flat and dull.\n\nThe AMG steering wheel is neither. Its organic shape immediately attracts your hands to the correct 10 and 2 positions. The perforated leathers a bit hard to the touch, and I wish the wheel itself would adjust lower (my elbows couldnt find a suitable perch). But the obligatory paddles, crafted from thick lumps of aluminum, tell you the tillers hooked-up to some serious stones. Yes indeed.\n\nIgniting the CL63s 6.2-liter, 518 horsepower, hand built AMG engine is an orgasmic experience. The four pipes spit out a guttural roar that vibrates your soul, resonating flesh and bone like the deep registers of gigantic church organ. Revving the CL63s engine nearly breaks the sound barrier, sending children and small dogs scurrying in terror, and condemning BMWs bag of bolts V10-powered M5 to eternal sonic shame.\n\nAMG has installed this remarkable engine across virtually the entire Mercedes line. While it has transformed every chassis it has touched, it has transmogrified only two. The E63 is remarkable for its balance and, dare I say it, affordability. In the CL63, the mega-V8s acceleration turns a boulevardier into a stealth fighter, capable of cruising serenely at speeds that other vehicles struggle to achieve.\n\nMore to the point, the CL63s acceleration is exactly as youd imagine: endlessly effortless and totally telepathic. Accompanied by a Wagnerian soundtrack, the naturally aspirated powerplant does a damn fine imitation of a big-bore V12 only without the hushed progress and nose-heavy nature. In fact, at speed, Id swear the CL63 AMG was no bigger than a 911.\n\nThe CL63s steering is firm but fair. The brakes are slightly stiff but unflappable, lending confidence to aggressive driving. The CL63s ride quality is firm (theres that word again) yet compliant. Road imperfections intrude very little on the luxury experience, despite standard 20 five-spoke AMG wheels.\n\nIn short, Id trade my left arm for a Mercedes Benz CL63 AMG. Trouble is, the German automaker wants an arm AND a leg. The price of admission to AMGs leather-lined roller coaster ride: 140 large. The monthly lease cost exceeds $3k. Even in California, a mortgage payment of this magnitude still affords a pretty nice house.", "title": "Mercedes CL63 AMG Start Up, Rev,Wheelslide,Fly-By,Accelerating", "publishedDate": "2009-08-23T15:13:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NhyrTqGknA", "description": "Harvard SEAS undergraduate students and alumns express their excitement at having the opportunity take a wide variety of classes within Harvard SEAS, Harvard College, and the various Harvard graduate schools and the freedom that gives them to craft their own educational experience.", "title": "Engineering the Harvard Way", "publishedDate": "2011-08-04T17:21:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NiDJ7-7Fbw", "description": "short vid of my abs after a refeed day of carb loading.", "title": "supaturk serratus abs vid", "publishedDate": "2012-11-05T12:56:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NiyWsLNyhI", "description": "Lubbock Christian University Men's basketball highlights from their win over Wayland Baptist on 2/13/12.", "title": "LCU vs. Wayland Baptist Men's Basketball Highlights - 2/13/12", "publishedDate": "2012-02-14T18:12:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NjTWFLn940", "description": "", "title": "Crawdaddy \u9955\u992e\u5c0f\u9f8d\u8766", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T18:39:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NjbuR7R81E", "description": "Bella a tutti , in questo video voglio mostrarvi come creare un keylogger locale che permette , di registrare tutto quello che viene digitato dalla tastiera del nostro pc.\n\nSe questo video , interesser\u00e0 , far\u00f2 anche un video dove spiego come creare un keylogger remoto.\n\nSpero vi sia stato utile , se cos\u00ec \u00e8 stato , vi invito ad iscrivervi e mettere un bel like ;)\n\nDownload Keylogger : http://www.mediafire.com/?mvkvtm81if1od\n\nContatti :\nEmail : xxfakehackerxx@Gmail.com\nAsk.fm : http://ask.fm/xXFakeHackerXx\nFaceBook :  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fake-Hacker/1427688810829117?fref=ts\nCrackNow : http://www.cracknow.net/", "title": "Come Creare Un KeyLogger Locale", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T14:19:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Nk4JFKj9hM", "description": "Earl Bergeron (aka ebfabman, ezEarl, and eb) installs a lower front bedside panel on a first generation blazer.", "title": "butt weld with mig sheetmetal bedside", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T02:04:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Nk8wrb2Se8", "description": "Looking a little deeper at what motivated Bufo to go on this strange journey and maximize his awareness of strange and unfathomable processes that expand the meaning of conscious and unconscious mentation", "title": "NLP Holism Tres", "publishedDate": "2009-12-05T22:20:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NkC3XOt96M", "description": "Arnold and Lou meet up at the 2011 expo", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno at Arnold Classic Expo 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-03-05T00:39:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "2NkMWuv901M", "description": "Subscribe to Complex for More: http://goo.gl/PJeLOl\n\nUnsurprisingly, it looks like this is Nick Cannon's fault.\n\nCheck out more of Complex here:\nhttp://www.complex.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ComplexMag\nhttps://www.facebook.com/complex\nhttp://instagram.com/complexmag\nhttps://plus.google.com/+complex/\n\nEntertaining videos that bring to life Complex Media's authoritative take on trendsetting music, sneakers, style, pop culture, video games, tech, cars, and art\u2014featuring your favorite celebrities from the past, present, and future.

In fact, consent has many components and is more properly viewed as a process. It covers a whole spectrum of interactions that may be more or less invasive or harmful and require varying amounts of communication between the parties.\n\nWhere the risk of harm is small the law can recognise imputed consent, where consent is assumed based on what is known about people. For example, because people want good quality medical treatment, it is assumed that people will not mind their x-rays, with any personal identifiers removed, being used to train doctors.\n\nImplied consent can be presumed based on a persons actions. If a person rolls up their sleeve when a nurse suggests taking their blood pressure, the nurse can assume that the person has consented to have it taken. Informed (or express or explicit) consent is more specific in the requirements it makes for both parties. It usually requires more information to be given to the person making the decision and requires that they make a specific choice, either yes or no, because the harm they might suffer is greater than in the other cases. For example, a researcher must obtain your consent before entering you into a clinical trial to test a new medicine, or a doctor before performing an invasive treatment. The greater the potential for harm, the greater need there is for informed consent.", "title": "Informed Consent - Levels of Consent", "publishedDate": "2008-10-08T10:49:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2O5QosCnm2s", "description": "CODE AFTER 13/11/11 SAO PAULO-BRAZIL", "title": "DJ JR LOPPEZ TOCANDO NO CODE AFTER", "publishedDate": "2011-11-13T21:38:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2O5WWVIXVT4", "description": "All you have to do is hold the facial exerciser in your mouth and swing the ends of the bar up and down to tone up your facial muscles.\nExercise your facial muscles\n30 seconds, twice a day", "title": "FACIAL FITNESS PAO", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T08:07:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "2O5jo7f1Du4", "description": "KIKI C ft.

Sounds Good and Loud...\n\n Thank you for showing an interest in my bullroarer video. A lot of people have asked me to provide the dimensions of the Bullroarer seen in this video. I tend to make objects like this, impromptu. With saws knives and sand papers and no rulers,  finishing it with flat surface sanding. I just make them by eye, shave and test and shave and test. That one was quite heavy... I say \"was\" because in my first attempt to do a \"Bullroarer from across the water\" video. I was using the one in this video. The Camera was set up and I was on the other side of the body of water. I got a good drone going, nice and loud, then, the cord snapped. And the roarer seemed to slowly fly down then back up, like a feather on the wind, then dove into the water. Shot down to the bottom of the river and I lost sight of it. I jumped into the kayak and tried to see if I could find it floating down river.  I checked logjams and eddies for a few miles. It was gone for good. So I made a new one. The sound was, unfortunately not as loud as the last one. As seen in my second attempt at an over water video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nme5CXfXPWc \nI made the changes I needed for a new video to replace the one in the link. A third attempt video is soon to come. \n\n The Dimensions of the this one are strictly from memory.  It was cocobolo that had some good weight. It was tapered where the cord was attached and flat on the other end with rounded corners. It was 30 cm long and 5 cm wide, give or take. It was 8 mm to 1 cm thick with tapering edges to maybe 5 or 6 mm all the way down. A cross-section would look like a flattened hexagon standing on a point. I hope my description of it's shape is clear enough. Best types of wood  to use are heavy hardwoods. Fire damaged Blood Oak in Australia was often used. I have a tiny scrap of that. I never worked it because it's very thin and 10 cm long by 50 cm wide. Just like pines and cedars it would be too light and wont allow good momentum when spinning. Lignum Vitae is another hardwood I have used. It stays nice and sharp and it is solid as a rock. The sharp edges help increase the volume as well. Then I just finish it with a wood oil of any type. That one was scrap wood I picked up for some flutes that I had been making. It had a beautiful marble pattern. It also had rare wormhole damage, which helped increase surface area for more sound. The cordage was braided artificial sinew at about 2 meters.\n\nI was very bummed out when I lost it. It was a good one. I hope this information is helpful to you in building yourself a nice Bullroarer. It's quite simple really and I would very much like see how it turns out.", "title": "Bullroarer in Action", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T02:06:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ODOA7bkmSk", "description": "1 Regt AAC heros in Middle Wallop", "title": "Sambuca Haircut", "publishedDate": "2009-12-06T12:47:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2ODW-ntPHSU", "description": "Note: \nSchematics and information about the circuit is now available at 4hv.org:\n\nhttp://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?74096\n\nThis is a small scale demonstration of wireless power transfer between two coupled parallel LC tuned circuits, each consisting of a copper conductor loop acting as an inductor and a capacitor. Both LC circuits are tuned to equal individual resonant frequencies. One of them is a part of a 1.5Mhz radio frequency oscillator powered by 12 volts DC, while another is loaded by a 24V 5W incandescent light bulb. Brought in proximity, copper loops share a small mutual inductance, essentially forming a transformer. In order to transmit significant amount of power through this transformer a very large amount of reactive power needs to circulate in it's primary, requiring use of a thick copper tube for the conductor, and a bank of eight 6.8nF capacitors in parallel. \nReceiver coil's leakage inductance is in turn canceled out by another capacitor, allowing for the maximum power transfer to the load.\n\nExperimenting with copper loop orientations, one can find positions of the receiver close to transmitter where no power is received, as total magnetic flux crossing through the receiver loop is zero. Hence this is a directional method of power transmission.\n\nDue to small size of the apparatus very little power is actually radiated in far field, with losses being mainly ohmic heating. Hence this method is also sometimes known as non-radiative or near-field power transmission.", "title": "Wireless power transfer via inductive coupling", "publishedDate": "2009-04-17T18:17:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "2OEF6IRcEZs", "description": "Sheet music/\u697d\u8b5c: http://laute.tumblr.com/piano\n\nI triedp laying the new ED for Monogatari Second Season - Koimonogatari on piano.

Penyebab konjungtivitis bisa jadi infeksius (virus, bakteri, atau chlamydial) atau noninfeksius (misalnya alergi, iritan). Sebagian besar kasus konjungtivitis yang disebabkan oleh virus dan bakteri dapat sembuh sendiri.Berbagai penyebab mata merah lainnya, seperti: blefaritis, abrasi kornea, benda asing, perdarahan di subkonjungtiva, keratitis, iritis, glaukoma, scleritis, dan zat kimiawi yang mudah terbakar (chemical burn).Konjungtivitis akibat virus (terutama dari adenovirus yang paling mudah menular) biasanya menyebar atau menular melalui kontak langsung dengan jari-jari yang terkontaminasi (virus), instrumen medis, air di kolam renang, atau melalui benda-benda pribadi (handuk, sapu tangan, bantal, guling, dsb). Bila gejala akibat konjungtivitis virus ini belum membaik setelah 7-10 hari, maka segeralah berkonsultasi ke dokter spesialis mata (ophthalmologist).\n\nKonjungtivitis akibat infeksi bakteri bisa dialami oleh anak-anak maupun orang dewasa. Pada anak-anak, konjungtivitis umumnya disebabkan oleh infeksi bakteri Streptococcus pneumoniae dan Haemophilus influenzae, sedangkan pada dewasa seringkali disebabkan oleh infeksi bakteri Staphylococcus aureus.SolusiUntuk konjungtivitis virus, diperlukan terapi suportif, termasuk kompres dingin, dekongestan mata, dan air mata buatan. Terapi kortikosteroid topikal untuk penyebab apapun dari mata merah haruslah digunakan di bawah pengawasan dokter spesialis mata.Untuk konjungtivitis bakteri, diperlukan antibiotik mata (ophthalmic antibiotic) berupa salep dan/atau tetes mata yang sesuai.Untuk konjungtivitis alergi, dapat diberi agen antihistamine/vasoconstrictor, atau antagonis reseptor H1 histamin topikal generasi kedua, atau golongan mast cell stabilizers, atau obat anti-inflamasi non-steroid yang sesuai.Untuk mencegah mata merah, caranya mudah. Hindari menggosok mata dengan jari atau tangan. Seringlah cuci tangan. Bila bekerja dengan komputer, maka beristirahatlah setiap 30 menit bekerja selama 10 menit. Perbanyak konsumsi buah dan sayuran, terutama yang mengandung vitamin A dan beta karoten. Hindarilah debu atau asap (rokok). Pakailah kaca mata saat mengendarai sepeda motor di jalan raya. Hindari membaca sambil tiduran. Hindari langsung membuka komputer, laptop, atau handphone setelah bangun tidur. Hindari paparan sinar matahari secara langsung. Bila berada di terik sinar matahari, pakailah pelindung berupa kacamata, payung, atau helm.Demikian penjelasan ini, semoga memberikan solusi.Salam sehat dan sukses selalu!

Today we have  effective and affordable tools to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. But we have to work together to make sure everyone has access to them.\"\nUNDP and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership have recently released a framework for engaging multiple sectors,-  education, agriculture, water and land use and others - to ensure sustainability and cost-efficiency in the fight against malaria. \n\nUNDP Administrator Helen Clark said investments in malaria control directly support a country's economic growth and human development.  \"Reducing and ultimately eliminating malaria has a powerful impact on various sectors in malaria-endemic countries. These include economic development, education, tourism, agriculture and infrastructure, among others\".\n\nFatoumata Nafo-Traor\u00e9, Executive Director of Roll Back Malaria, said the fight against malaria has proven to be among the best buys in global health. \"It allows the world's most vulnerable people to live healthier and more productive lives and to build a more prosperous future for themselves and their children,\" she said.\n\nDidier Drogba is the captain and all-time top scorer of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire national football team.  Born in Abidjan , Drogba spent his childhood in his native C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and his adopted country, France. Didier Drogba was voted best all time Chelsea player and has played until this year with Galatasaray (Istanbul), in the Turkish league. Since he became a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador in January 2007, he  has been actively raising awareness of Africa's challenges and efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \n\n \"I am very happy that this video can be shown globally\", said Didier Drogba. \"Using the popularity of football to increase awareness will help us to win the match against malaria.

Opening against the backdrop of the roaring 1920's, a young, ambitious newspaper reporter, \"Jesse Helms\", sets out to uncover the truth behind a famous bank robbery gone wrong in 1893, and the myth behind its alleged ring-leader, \"Duke Donovan\". Visiting the estate of a reclusive millionaire, \"Seymour Redfield\", Helms begins to piece together Donovan's story, discovering more than he bargained for in the process.  Helms learns that Donovan, a famous lawman prior to the robbery, turned himself in and was put on trial for his crime.  Sent to the Yuma Territorial Prison on a life sentence, Donovan enters the tortuous prison regime, forced to live among the outlaws that he put there.  While enduring the hell of imprisonment under the sadistic control of  \"Warden Logan\", Donovan soon discovers that his bank robbery partner, \"Levi Hardin\" , is still alive, and planning to kill Donovan's wife for revenge.  Donovan devises a daring escape with the help of fellow prisoner, \"Cyrus Parker\", an old Buffalo Soldier . Knowing that they will be hunted and killed, Donovan and Cyrus begin a life and death journey to save Donovan's wife, and the legacy of the fabled U.S. Marshal.  With the spirit of  SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION in the old west, this revisionist, action-packed Western explores the challenges that one man will endure to defend family, justice and honor.\n\nTEAM TWO Entertainment presents a DUSTIN RIKERT film AMBUSH AT DARK CANYON\nStarring KIX BROOKS and ERNIE HUDSON.\n\nWebsite      www.teamtwoentertainment.com\nIMDb          http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098799/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2\nTwitter        @teamtwofilms\nFacebook   https://www.facebook.com/pages/TEAM-TWO-ENTERTAINMENT/133198313453245?ref=hl\nPinterest     http://pinterest.com/teamtwofilms/boards/\nInstagram   http://instagram.com/teamtwoentertainment\n\nExecutive Producer:  JAMES AYLWARD\nMusic Produced by KIX BROOKS  \nDirector of Photography A.J.

After several harrowing years in an orphanage, where she was placed by a supercilious relative for exhibiting the forbidden trait of \"willfulness,\" Jane Eyre (Joan Fontaine) secures work as a governess. Her little charge, French-accented Adele (Margaret O'Brien), is pleasant enough. But Jane's employer, the brooding, tormented Edward Rochester (Orson Welles), terrifies the prim young governess. Under Jane's gentle influence, Rochester drops his forbidding veneer, going so far as to propose marriage to Jane. But they are forbidden connubial happiness when it is revealed that Rochester is still married to a gibbering lunatic whom he is forced to keep locked in his attic. Rochester reluctantly sends Jane away, but she returns, only to find that the insane wife has burned down the mansion and rendered Rochester sightless. In the tradition of Victorian romances, this purges Rochester of any previous sins, making him a worthy mate for the loving Jane. The presence of Orson Welles in the cast (he receives top billing), coupled with the dark, Germanic style of the direction and photography, has led some impressionable cineasts to conclude that Welles, and not Stevenson, was the director. To be sure, Welles contributed ideas throughout the filming; also, the script was heavily influenced by the Mercury Theater on the Air radio version of Jane Eyre, on which Welles, John Houseman and musical director Bernard Herrmann all collaborated. But Jane Eyre was made at 20th Century-Fox, a studio disinclined to promote the auteur theory; like most Fox productions, this is a work by committee rather than the product of one man. This in no way detracts from the overall excellence of the film; of all adaptations of Jane Eyre (it had previously been filmed in 1913, 1915 and 1921, and has been remade several times since), this 1943 version is one of the best. Keep an eye out for an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor as the consumptive orphanage friend of young Jane Eyre (played as child by Peggy Ann Gardner)", "title": "Jane Eyre (1943)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T07:33:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2OYJ0jqzyLI", "description": "amazing beat boxers!", "title": "beat boxers- wyclif jean!", "publishedDate": "2009-08-14T21:03:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2OYifZB2d88", "description": "Kermit Erasmus is expected to be unveiled by Pirates chairperson Dr Irvin Khoza later this week, according to the Sowetan on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier negotiations over a move for Erasmus from SuperSport United to Orlando Pirates were bogged down over his salary demands, sources close to the transfer talks said.\n\nErasmus was given an ultimatum by SuperSport to make up his mind as to whether he was staying or leaving the Tshwane side.\n\nErasmus is a top transfer target for the country's top three teams -- Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns.\n\nThe trio tabled offers for the former South African youth international and it is up to the player to decide on one of the three, or if he will stay with Matsatsantsa a Pitori.

Teens or adults with unknown ACA may have an initial episode of chest pain, heart failure, or even sudden cardiac death before the condition is recognized.\nAnomalous coronary arteries occur in approximately 5 percent of people undergoing cardiac catheterization to evaluate chest pain.

All other alarm systems have one serious, and potentially fatal, flaw -- they can be rendered useless simply by cutting a single wire. Tattletale uses wireless technology. No wires to cut means that would-be thieves have no way to disable a Tattletale. Tattletale is the first and only alarm system to use 'cellular burst' technology which sends a signal to you and the authorities less than one-second after a sensor is tripped. Tattletale uses military grade, high-impact plastics making it virtually indestructible. The base unit incorporates a color LCD touch screen, siren, motion detector, strobe light, and built-in battery. The base unit is portable and weighs less that two pounds. Place it anywhere. Usually, people keep it on their nightstand, so they can set it after going to bed. Your visitors and guests will not even know that it is an alarm system! You receive two Door/Window sensors with the base unit. The base unit also has a built-in motion detector. This is enough for most situations, but if your needs change you are able to easily expand your security perimeter. The base unit will detect up to 95 sensors. You can add other sensors at any time. All Tattletale components are manufactured and assembled in the United States. You will receive a Tattletale base unit, two Door/Window sensors, and a remote-control key fob. You will also receive two activation forms. One is for 24/7 Live National Monitoring Center (LNMC) service, and the other is for Text Messaging and Email (TME) service. The cost of 24/7 National Monitoring Center service is\n29.95 per month. The cost of Text Messaging and Email service is\n19.95 per month.

It was first known in the 17th century, later it became a dangerous devil to human life.\n\nAgain Diabetes is differentiated in to two types\u2019 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas (or) any auto-immune disease. While diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone) which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus.  Its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney and due to this it control the concentration of urine. But its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water.\n\nDiabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated, although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination. Diabetes mellitus is more common than the Diabetes insipidus. \n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  There are mainly three types of Diabetes mellitus.\n\nTYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\nThe body does not produce insulin due to dis-function of pancreas. Such diabetes called as insulin dependent diabetes. People usually develop type-1 diabetes before their 40th year often in early adulthood (or) teenage years.\n\nToday type 1 diabetes has no proper treatment in all over the world.  So these individuals are insulin dependent to rest of their life. Approximately 23 % of all diabetes cases are type\n\n1.COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:\n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss.\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Increased urination (sometimes as often as every hour).\n\u00fc Nausea perhaps vomiting.\n\u00fc Blurred vision.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Dry mouth.\n\u00fc Itching skin.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nTYPE 2 DIABETES:\n\nGlobally as of 2013 an estimated 382 million people have type 2 diabetes worldwide. About 90% cases are type 2 diabetes. This is happening due to lack of energy in the pancreas. So that pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in our body.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Unusual weight loss (or) gain.\n\u00fc Excessive thirst.\n\u00fc Excessive hungry.\n\u00fc Weak eye sight.\n\u00fc Increased urination (especially during night times).\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness.\n\u00fc In women frequent vaginal infections.\n\u00fc Slow healing wounds.\n\nGESTATION DIABETES:\n\nThis type of diabetes usually occurs in pregnant mothers during gestation (pregnancy) period. So there is an increase in high blood sugar in pregnant mother. Most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth, but it does put you at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF GESTATION DIABETES: \n\n\u00fc Increased urination\n\u00fc Fatigue (or) tiredness\n\u00fc Increased thirst\n\u00fc Nausea and vomiting\n\u00fc Blurred vision\n\u00fc Weight loss\n\u00fc Hormonal imbalance\n\u00fc Head aches\n\u00fc Body pain \n\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nThe several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nNEUROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus. It is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region (or) other reasons like autoimmune, infection, surgery, head trauma, and some drugs.\n\nNEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in     the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.\n\nDIPSOGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS:\n\nDipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, which is located in the hypothalamus. This defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst. Such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration without seeking water to drink.\n\nFor more details - \n\n Blog: http://diabetestreatmentinnadipathy.blogspot.in/\n\nYoutube:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmYxb4HnTMmGJUTHnGsYbafwN-IwYyNFP\n\n     Nadipathy Centres \n\n1.

Habituellement dans\u00e9 comme un groupe de gar\u00e7ons et de filles, toute v\u00eatue de plus (la jupe d'herbe de Tahiti, mais pas fait d'herbe, mais des fibres de l'\u00e9corce de la purau ( hibiscus )).\nLes gar\u00e7ons se serrent les genoux (comme des ciseaux, de l\u00e0 l'utilisation du mot P\u0101 OTI (ciseaux) pour ce mouvement), et les filles secouer les hanches (et leurs longs poils l\u00e2ches, s'ils en ont). En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le mouvement de leurs genoux est le moteur qui entra\u00eene les hanches. Leurs pieds doivent rester \u00e0 plat sur \u200b\u200ble sol et les \u00e9paules doivent rester stationnaire. Cependant traditionnellement dans le ote'a ou Ura Pa'u, les hanches \u00e0 Tahiti sont secou\u00e9s en rond (dans ce qui est connu comme la machine \u00e0 laver), tandis que dans le \u00celes Cook, les hanches sont dans un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 un mouvement lat\u00e9ral. Mais en raison du tamure, cet accent est moins important. Les mouvements des mains est d'une importance secondaire. Les filles sont en grande partie encore debout, les gar\u00e7ons se d\u00e9placent autour de leur partenaire, en face d'elle en face ou se cacher derri\u00e8re son dos (comme on le voit dans le public). Le tempo de la musique est continuellement augment\u00e9 au point o\u00f9 seuls les danseurs les plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et les plus aptes peuvent garder leurs secousses en place.

TAMURE est un mot \u00e9tranger, le nom d'un poisson dans l' Tuamotu , le vrai nom de la danse est ori Tahiti (danse tahitienne). Peu de temps apr\u00e8s la seconde guerre mondiale, un soldat du bataillon du Pacifique, Louis Martin, a \u00e9crit une chanson sur un rythme classique dans lequel il a utilis\u00e9 le mot TAMURE assez souvent comme un tra-la-la.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Dance Dance Dance.........let's india dance", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T11:50:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "2P1bR6hShJ4", "description": "", "title": "Space Shuttle Challenger Explosion Watched by Back Up Teacher", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T08:28:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2P1rcpSmGvQ", "description": "Little Jurnee is not little knowmore she grew up to be a beautiful young lady.

He's obnoxious. He's partial to terrible puns. But deep down, Orange always means well, even though his boredom often drags his friends into ridiculous adventures.\nAPPLE:\nApple is an uptight goody two-shoes who rarely joins Orange's adventures for fear he'll get bruised, though he usually ends up even worse off just by staying behind.\nGRANDPA LEMON\nGrandpa Lemon is the befuddled, elder statesman of the fruit stand. He thinks he's everybody's grandpa, and he often falls asleep in mid-sentence.\nANNOYING ORANGE  \nAnnoying Orange has his own TV show!

He prefers to be called \"Little Apple,\" but hardly anybody obliges.\nGRAPEFRUIT\nGrapefruit is a hulking man-boy who thinks of himself as \"large and in charge.\" He believes he's in a rivalry with Orange for Passion Fruit's affection, but she has no interest in him.\nPASSION FRUIT\nShe's adorable, pragmatic and smart. So why does Passion Fruit have such a big crush on Orange? It's no secret she likes him, except to Orange, who is completely oblivious.\nPEAR\nPear is both friend and foil to Orange, and he often stands as the sole voice of reason in the fruit stand. Pear's attempts to talk Orange out of his wilder ideas never work.\n\nPeartegeist\nPEARTEGEIST\nSeason 2 - Aired on 10/16/13\nOrange stirs up spooky spirits with his painful punning - so now how will the fruits of Daneboe's get rid of these ghostly interlopers?\nHungry Fruit Games\nHUNGRY FRUIT GAMES\nSeason 2 - Aired on 10/09/13\nAfter a broccoli invasion, the fruit must battle in an arena of death.

That was before we had a record contract. The version on this record is pretty different. A lot of people asked us why we didn't put it on the first album. But we felt because it was on Metal For Muthas we didn't want to put it on the first album. By the time we did Killers we weren't happy with that version so so we wanted to record it properly. The guitar frills around the vocals were from Adrian. Originally they weren't there but when Adrian joined the band he decided to put them in. '' (Steve Harris)\n\nThis is the classic track from Killers...It's catchy and accessible, and was originally recorded on the  Metal For Muthas compilation, which might be why it wasn't included on the previous album. It is about an angry young man searching for his unknown father, presumably with violent intentions. Nice bass intro too. ''\n\n'Killers' is the second album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on February 2, 1981 in the UK, and June, 1981 in the US. The album was the first of their albums to feature guitarist  Adrian Smith, and the last to feature vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was fired from the band mid-tour due to problems with alcohol  and cocaine. This was also the first Iron Maiden album produced by veteran producer Martin Birch who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.", "title": "Iron Maiden-2.Wrathchild(Chile 1996)", "publishedDate": "2008-07-29T19:22:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Pew0_ibG5E", "description": "5 members of Tau Gamma fraternity arrested while conducting an actual hazing in Cavite.\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN News channel! - http://goo.gl/7lR5ep\n\nWatch the full episodes of TV Patrol on TFC.TV  \nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-TFCTV\nand on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, click:\nhttp://bit.ly/TVP-IWANTV\n\nVisit our website at http://www.abs-cbnnews.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abscbnnews", "title": "5 alleged Tau Gamma Phi members arrested", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T13:49:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Pf3-jYMIF0", "description": "This video was to promote our 5th anniversary party  - 03.09.2011\n\nBilly Emerson - A Dancin' Whippersnapper (Tarpon)\n\nhttp://soulinn.de |  http://www.facebook.com/soulinnberlin\n\nChristian G\u00f6bel & Kristian Auth's \"At The Soul Inn\" .\n\nSince it was founded in 2006, on every first Saturday of each month there's no better place for friends of real Soul Music than the Lido: the whole dancefloor, housed in this old 50s cinema, bounces to the dynamic Soul Sound played from rare 45's.

A great future for the battery is predicted in the modern electric car. But how does this battery work? The animation shows how the components of the battery work together to release energy and to recharge the battery again. The goal: BASF wants to make the electric car of tomorrow reliable and suitable for everyday use with lithium-ion batteries. BASF helps to increase the mobility of the electric car by making the lithium-ion battery even more powerful.\n\nThis film explains the principle of the lithium-ion battery: The battery is enclosed in an aluminum and copper layer. In between are a positive electrode, the cathode, and a negative electrode, the anode. The cathode consists of a lithium metal oxide, the anode is a graphite layer. In order for the Li ions to migrate into the cell, the cell is filled with an electrolyte. The electrolyte of the battery must be extremely clean. Cathode and anode in the battery are split by a separator, which is permeable to the Lithium-ion. In addition, the process of charging and discharging is displayed.\n\nFurther information about battery, electric car and the portfolio of BASF can be found at:\nhttp://www.battery-solutions.basf.com\n\nWe create chemistry: For further information visit http://www.basf.com", "title": "Lithium-ion batteries: How do they work?", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T09:43:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Pk9jKvaASs", "description": "http://www.metabolikcerrahi.com/ileal-interpozisyon/", "title": "\u015eeker Ameliyat\u0131 - \u0130leal \u0130nterpozisyon Nedir? - Do\u00e7.

There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.[1]\n\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way.

All sexually reproducing organisms derive from a common ancestor which was a single celled eukaryotic species[1]. Many protists reproduce sexually, as do the multicellular plants, animals, and fungi. There are a few species which have secondarily lost this feature, such as Bdelloidea and some parthenocarpic plants. The evolution of sex contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its origin and its maintenance. However, since the hypotheses for the origins of sex are difficult to test experimentally, most current work has been focused on the maintenance of sexual reproduction.\n\nThe geology of the Grand Canyon area exposes one of the most complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand Canyon National Park area range in age from about 200 million to nearly 2 billion years old. \n\nReal Science:\nPollen is a fine to coarse powder containing the microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce the male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat that protects the sperm cells during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. When pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone (i.e., when pollination has occurred), it germinates and produces a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule (or female gametophyte). Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail.\n\nColossians 1:16 \"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.\"\n\n The discovery of tiny pollen grains in rock shows just how inflated the billions of years claimed by evolutionists really are. This discovery, by a creation scientist, has turned those pollen grains into tiny time bombs that continue to damage the theory of evolution.\n\nIn 1964, Dr. Clifford Burdick devised a new, better way to collect pollen samples, and he used this method to gather samples in the Grand Canyon. These pollen samples, when viewed under the microscope, allowed scientists to identify what kinds of trees they came from. The Hakatai shale, dated by evolutionists at 600 million years old, was among the layers Dr. Burdick examined for pollen. According to evolutionary dating, this layer would not have contained pollen from conifer trees. Conifers supposedly hadn't yet evolved. When conifer pollen was discovered in the samples, evolutionists quickly claimed that they were modern pollen grains that had contaminated the sample.\n\nThe problem with the evolutionists' explanation is that pollen is resistant to staining. Yet, this pollen was stained with red from the shale itself. It must have been there a long time. The experiment was repeated in 1970. Not only were grains of conifer pollen again found, but pollen from oak trees and evidence of other flowering plants were found as well.\n\nThe discovery of these pollen grains offers scientific evidence that evolution's time scale and story of history is wrong. The evidence does support the accuracy of the Bible that tells us that all life began during the first week of the Earth's history a few thousand years ago.\n\nPrayer: \nI thank You, Lord, for those scientists who work to honor You.

Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a \"mob\", \"gang\" or \"clan\". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12--14 years, and about half this in the wild.\n\n\"Meerkat\" is a loanword from Afrikaans. The name has a Dutch origin but by misidentification. Dutch meerkat refers to the \"guenon\", a monkey of the Cercopithecus genus. The word \"meerkat\" is Dutch for \"lake cat\", but the suricata is not in the cat family, and neither suricatas nor guenons are attracted to lakes; the word possibly started as a Dutch adaptation of a derivative of Sanskrit marka\u0163a \u092e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u091f = \"monkey\", perhaps in Africa via an Indian sailor on board a Dutch East India Company ship. The traders of the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with monkeys, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. The suricata is called stokstaartje = \"little stick-tail\" in Dutch.\n\nAccording to African popular belief (mainly in the Zambian/Zimbabwean region), the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone tribesmen.", "title": "MEERKATS RULE!!!
