Nexus played a fusion of Electro, Industrial and Gothic followed by powerful and sharp vocals.\n\nThe Greek industrial goth band, NEXUS, released their second album \"..CYBERNAUT..\" on February 28, 2001. The album received critical acclaim by the media and fans, both in Greece and abroad. Distribution was done across the continent and the UK, and NEXUS tracks were featured in several foreign label compilations.\n\nYou can now find Mike Pougounas and Dimitris \"Sidheog\" Steves performing with their current band, New Zero God, along with bassist Harris Stavrakas (ex-The Flowers Of Romance), and guitarist Lao (ex-The Flowers Of Romance).\nhttp://www.newZEROgod.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/newZEROgodGR\n________________________________________\n\nNexus, \"Cybernaut\" (2001)\nMike Pougounas - Vocals, Keyboards, Programming\nDimitris \"Sidheog\" Steves - Drums, Backing Vocals (\"Hypnosis\"), Programming\nLefteris Strouggaris - Guitars, Programming\nCostas Spanos - Bass\n________________________________________\n\nHate-Rate - Lyrics:\n\nHey mate, what do you say? \nLooks like you find the way to fill in all our |nothings| with \ninjections \nof hate. \nWe're jacked in, hackin' our brains \npass me the virus now and loop it loop it loop it in any possible way. \nMalfunction seems to be the game you love us to play \nseduction, corruption, \nbuilding a new destruction \ngive me all the details and then show me the way \nto turn off all my feelings and just keep it to hate.\n\nDay by day \nMore sick than I could take \nDay by day \nIt's getting too deep \nit's dragging me down now...\n\nI feel it \nThe hate-rate \nGets you high when you are nothing at all \nYou need it, \nThe hate-rate \nit's making you someone \nit's making you someone.\n\nHey mate, what do you say? \nLooks like you find the way to fill in all our |nothings| with \ninjections\nof hate. \nWe're jacked in, hackin' our brains \npass me the virus now and loop it loop it loop it in any possible way. \nHammering the words you spit deep in my head \nlike a conjection, conjection, of skill and male attraction \nBrand me with your mark and stuff me full of fluffed up lies \nget me in stiches \nlovers are little bitches.\n\nMore information, including complete bio and discography at:\nhttp://www.myspace.com/NEXUSgr\n\nNexus at CD Baby:\nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/nexus", "title": "Nexus - \"Hate-Rate\"", "publishedDate": "2011-03-19T16:55:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "80POJyDeyP0", "description": "", "title": "TRT T\u00dcRK T\u00fcrkiye'de Sabah, Pierre Loti Tepesi-\u0130stanbul", "publishedDate": "2012-11-02T07:24:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "80P_9G7xJjk", "description": "Maddie y sus amigas intentan bajarle a la locura de la tienda de t\u00e9s antes de que Blondie Lockes\u2122 llegue a filmar una revisi\u00f3n.

The individuals affected by it cannot bring that change. Prosecutors cannot bring that change. Defense attorneys cannot bring that change. And under our system, not even judges can bring that change. And that is appropriately so, these changes are serious. And when they are to be made, they should be made by those people who are elected and therefore accountable to the people who these changes will affect.

You've likely already noticed them this spring. And more are expected in the weeks to come.This afternoon, Lacey Norris had a fun time at the St. Elmo Community Park with her 14-month-old son Brantley Cash.They were able to slide through the day without any visits from thye pesky mosquitoes already out in force.Despite precautions,  they've seen problems already this spring at their Lookout Valley home. He's been bit twice by the, I mean they're huge, the ones that are out right now, they're huge.Chris Ford, Service Center Manager at Jody Millard Pest Control pointed out the source of the problem in a stagnant pool in one homeowmer's back yard. Those are the larvae, they just kind of feed on all the matter there for a while.The major trouble spot is also in a heavily shaded back yard. Anytime you have standing water. This is more than enough even if you just had a water bottle likd, it's as simple as that. Once they get a foothold and they can do whatever they need to for however long they need to, Ford said.The first step to rid the problem, dump the water.Then, immeidate treatment. We would treat this with a larvacide so it would keep them from ever becoming adults which is the best way to reduce your mosquito population.Ford said the recent heavy rains and past two mild winters add up to a potential nasty mosquito laden summer.Aside from standing water, mosquitoes stay in ivy, leyland trees, in dense plants like monkey grass, and underneath decks.But Brantley's mother makes sure her precious son is protected.She uses mosquito spray, adhesive, repellant stickers on his clothes and a diet filled with garlic. Ingredients she hopes will make for a happy and pain-free spring and summer.Ford said if your problem is severe, you should treat every month. And one thing you may not think about with all this rain we've had is standing water in your gutters.Ford said you may want to unblock the drains and let them flow.", "title": "Mosquitoes Arrive Early", "publishedDate": "2013-05-10T22:58:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "80Z2yfTFpVA", "description": "Croisi\u00e8re", "title": "Inula", "publishedDate": "2011-01-16T11:07:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "80ZCxHV0i08", "description": "Taking HGH up by applied nutriceuticals.

Me ensinaram que Jornalismo \u00e9, muitas vezes, abrir m\u00e3o dos pr\u00f3prios medos em prol do que se acredita. E foi por isso que hoje eu e o Ramiro fomos detidos pela Brigada Militar e mantidos algemados durante a noite inteira. O crime foi ter gravado uma atitude truculenta da pol\u00edcia.\n\nEst\u00e1vamos saindo de um restaurante e indo para casa e, na esquina da rua Jo\u00e3o Pessoa com a Salgado Filho, vimos quatro policiais armados perseguindo um rapaz aparentemente menor de idade e o espancando, jogado no ch\u00e3o. Assim, covardemente. Dois contra um, com cacetes e armas \u00e0 tiracolo. Imediatamente tiramos nossos celulares do bolso e come\u00e7amos a gravar, do outro lado da rua. Dois policiais vieram at\u00e9 n\u00f3s e disseram, com toda a arrog\u00e2ncia que podiam, que est\u00e1vamos presos e nos arrastaram at\u00e9 a o posto da Brigada na pra\u00e7a XV de novembro. Atravessamos o centro todo gritando. Passamos pela frente da minha casa, alvos dos olhares horrorizados dos vizinhos e do dono da lanchonete no come\u00e7o da quadra, que, revoltado, gritava que os policiais tinham quebrado o seu estabelecimento. Mal sab\u00edamos n\u00f3s que os pr\u00f3prios nos acusariam depois de tal delito.\n\nEntrei na delegacia e olhei nos olhos da colega Tauana, que cobria a manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o. Quando ela gritou meu nome, e fui empurrado para dentro do posto, com policiais que ignoravam a imprensa e pouco se importavam com nossos direitos, percebi que o pior nos esperava.\n\nMesmo assim, n\u00e3o parei de questionar. O fiz nervosamente. Quando perguntei o motivo da minha pris\u00e3o, a resposta que recebi foi uma rasteira que me fez cair no ch\u00e3o, um chute no est\u00f4mago e spray de pimenta na cara. E n\u00e3o fui s\u00f3 eu quem recebeu os golpes. Uma menina de 15 anos barbaramente violentada por policiais. Um senhor mais velho, ao contestar o modo como o tratavam recebeu socos e pontap\u00e9s de 5 policiais o mesmo tempo. Em intervalos, o secret\u00e1rio da seguran\u00e7a do Estado ia e voltava e ignorava os protestos de todos que, acuados, tentavam entender o que acontecia.\n\nNo momento da humilhante revista, um policial tomou minhas roupas e roubou meu celular. Gritando, perguntei o que seria feito com ele. O objeto foi devolvido em seguida, mas sem o cart\u00e3o de mem\u00f3ria com a grava\u00e7\u00e3o de todo o acontecimento. Por sorte, o Ramiro gravou e conseguiu salvar o v\u00eddeo que compartilho com voc\u00eas abaixo. Apesar de n\u00e3o conseguirmos mostrar o rosto dos policiais, o \u00e1udio j\u00e1 \u00e9 um bom \u00e1libe.\n\nFicamos ouvindo xingamentos homof\u00f3bicos e chacota em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o durante 7 horas. Quando se cansaram e se sentiram pressionados por advogados da fam\u00edlia e volunt\u00e1rios que nos ajudaram, geraram um termo circunstancial acusando a todos de baderna.\n\nPor favor, divulguem. Estamos sendo acusados de termos cometido crimes que n\u00e3o cometemos, simplesmente por gravar o trabalho de servidores p\u00fablicos que pensam que s\u00e3o imperadores da for\u00e7a. Jamais aceitaremos que uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o que deveria nos proteger seja o bra\u00e7o opressor de um Estado que n\u00e3o recebe mais o cr\u00e9dito de nenhum cidad\u00e3o com o m\u00ednimo de capacidade racional. \nO que mais me chocou foi passar pelo hospital e ver que muitos aplaudiam com a atitude  de troglodita dos brigadianos.

The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Rabid badger rescue!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T20:17:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "80lss7rPgA0", "description": "V\u00eddeo produzido por Marcos Makoto Ono e Valter da Silva Queiroz, mostra uma Bothrops neuwiedii dando bote em uma bexiga contendo \u00e1gua morna.", "title": "Serpente, Bothrops neuwiedii (dando bote)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-12T20:06:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "80m8WKvx78E", "description": "", "title": "MF teszt: Middy Shot gun", "publishedDate": "2011-03-12T15:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "80mF-Kx9EXU", "description": "Indiscretion on Bareboat Charter", "title": "42' Post \" Indiscretion\" Underway to Spectacle Island", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07T11:44:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "80mGsuVY67g", "description": "En soutien aux expuls\u00e9s de Notre Dame Des Landes !

Then plan an itinerary.\n\nStep 2: Decide who to travel with\nDecide whether you want to travel alone, with a friend, or with a group. If you will be traveling with others, make sure everyone's expectations are aligned.\n\nStep 3: Decide when to travel\nPick when you want to travel. Prices will be high in peak season, but some hostels may be closed and many attractions have shortened hours in the off season.\n\nTip\nAn advantage of traveling in the warmer months is that your backpack will be lighter.\n\nStep 4: Make a cost assessment\nMake a realistic assessment of the cost of the trip. Pad your budget so you will not have to forgo something you want to do but didn't plan on.\n\nStep 5: Consider accommodations\nDecide whether you will be most comfortable making reservations for your accommodations in advance, or if you would rather take your chances on finding something when you arrive.\n\nTip\nSearching for a room in a strange city while carrying a heavy backpack is not everybody's cup of tea.\n\nStep 6: Purchase a guidebook\nPurchase several guidebooks and bone up on your destinations ahead of time.

It sounds like you had multiple miscarriages and I'm so sorry about those. This time around, it sounds like you have a placenta previa and an abruption. A placenta previa is where the placenta has attached over the cervix and this is a problem for a few different reasons. First of all, there's a large blood supply going to the placenta each time your heart beats and this is because your baby receives oxygen and nutrients through the placenta from you. So if this is attached over the cervix, which is supposed to open up and dilate so the baby can be born--- if you start to contract or dilate at all, it can cause massive bleeding. Many women with placenta previas, in fact, up to 80% end up in the hospital at least once before they deliver because of bleeding episodes. Many times, specialists will recommend early delivery between 36-37 weeks before you actually have a complicated emergency situation where you've had a massive bleed or something. So, a placenta previa is definitely deeming you a high-risk pregnancy, but your chances of having a healthy baby are still great as long as there's not other complications and you get help as soon as possible if you start to have a bleed. Then the chances of you and your baby being healthy are still great. One other thing with a placenta previa.  If you have this, then you will get a C-section when it comes time for delivery because you can't deliver the baby's lifeline first.  Also, like we talked about earlier, if you start to dilate or contract at all, you'll start to bleed. So a C-section is necessary. Now, as far as a placental abruption goes, a placental abruption is where the placenta starts to prematurely detach from the uterine wall. Again, this is a problem because it means that the blood supply that should be going to the baby isn't and the mother's losing blood. There can be varying degrees. There can be a small tear in a very pertinent area of the placenta that causes issues or there can be a large tear in not such a pertinent area and the baby is still doing okay and mom's still stable. The pregnancy can be prolonged with bed rest. So, every situation is so different. I can't necessarily tell you exactly what your outcomes are going to be, but your OB provider is going to be a good resource for you. Be sure to ask them these questions that you have and sit down and have a candid conversation about your concerns. They can give you the best information based on their knowledge of your individual circumstances.

Tigers typically follow boar groups, and pick them off one by one. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey, though they will usually avoid tackling mature male boars. In many cases, boars have gored tigers to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for the Siberian Tiger alongside the Manchurian Wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the prey selected by these tigers. Studies of Bengal Tigers indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids. Boars are also probably an important component of the diet of Sumatran Tigers, though their specific significance in the tiger's diet there is not known.\n\nWolves are also major predators of boars in some areas. Wolves mostly feed on piglets, though adults have been recorded to be taken in Italy, the Iberian Peninsula, and Russia. Wolves rarely attack boars head on, preferring to tear at their perineum, causing loss of coordination and massive blood loss. In some areas of the former Soviet Union, a single wolf pack can consume an average of 50--80 wild boars annually. In areas of Italy where the two animals are sympatric, the extent to which boars are preyed upon by wolves has led to them developing more aggressive behaviour toward both wolves and domestic dogs.\n\nStriped hyenas occasionally feed on boars, though it has been suggested that only hyenas from the three larger subspecies present in Northwest Africa, the Middle East, and India can successfully kill them.\n\nYoung piglets are important prey for several species, including large snakes, such as the reticulated python, large birds of prey, and various wild felids. In Australia many piglets are killed by dingos. Adults, due to their size, strength, and defensive aggression, are generally avoided as prey. However, they have been taken additionally by mature leopards; large bears (mainly brown bears); and mature crocodiles. All predators of boars are opportunistic and would take piglets given the opportunity. Where introduced outside of their natural range, boars may be at the top of the food chain, but it is possible that can taken by predators similar to those in their native Eurasia.\nWild boar attacks on humans are not common but do occur occasionally. Usually, boars, like most wild animals, will avoid interactions with humans. Due to the clearing of natural boar habitats, the number of interactions, including aggressive ones, between humans and boars has increased. When dealing aggressively with a human, boars will charge at them. Sometimes, these may be bluff charges but, in other cases, violent contact will be made. While the impact of the large, hard-skulled head may cause considerable damage itself, most damage is inflicted by the boar's tusk. When ramming into a person, the boar will slash the tusks upwards, creating sizeable open lacerations on the skin. Due to the height of the boar relative to a human, most wounds are inflicted to the upper legs. Some attacks are provoked, such as when hunters wound a boar which then counterattacks. Male boars become most aggressive during the mating season and may charge at humans at such times. Occasionally, female boars will attack if they feel their piglets are threatened, especially if a human physically comes between them and their young. Although a majority of boar attack victims recover with medical treatment, fatalities do occasionally occur.\nIndian wild boar Sus scrofa cristatus: A long-maned subspecies with a coat that is brindled black unlike S. s. davidi. More lightly built than European boar. Its head is larger and more pointed than that of the European boar, and its ears smaller and more pointed.

So, it allows us to really work together in ways that other firms couldn't.\n\n[Brandon Buchner, structural intern] So you get all these different trades and groups working together as one entity. Which, in the near future, we'll be seeing quite a bit of really high end, really amazing design. And I think a lot of that has to do with BIM and its power.\n\n[Anna Wilcox, interior designer] I can link my interiors model to the architecture model in another office. I can see what he's doing. He can see what I'm doing. And I can do my own work without having to email it, or scan it.\n\n[Coulter Toatley, design director] What BIM gives me the opportunity to do is get a well-coordinated set of documents to an owner, that accounts for all the owner's needs, has mitigated a good portion of their potential risks, as well as start allowing them to do facilities management, before the building is ever built. When you go into construction, you have multiple contractors, multiple sub-contractors. Mitigate that and give the client something that they're going to deal with and live.\n\n[Seth Meyrow, BIM analyst] We actually do have this dedicated team, myself included, and supporting, implementing this technology is what we do, basically 40 hours a week.\n\n[Larry Hlavacek, project manager] Dewberry has a structure, a team of professionals, that are charged with the task of seeing what the future trends are going to be and to really keep us on the forefront of that technology.\n\n[Mark Scott, associate principal] From beginning to end\u2014from cradle to grave, actually\u2014the design is done much more efficiently, and there's a lot more coordination between all the disciplines.\n\n[Kelli Lubeley, BIM technician] Dewberry stays on the cutting edge of BIM technology while being one of the most standardized firms in the business.

Uighur activists contend that restrictive and discriminatory policies favoring the Chinese migrants are fueling the bloodshed. The knowledge that Muslims elsewhere are rising up against their governments also seems to be contributing to the increased militancy.\n\nThe two vehicles crashed through barriers at 7:50 a.m. and drove right into the crowds while setting off explosives, according to a statement by the Xinjiang regional government. It was unclear how many assailants were in the cars.\n\nThe SUVs then crashed head-on and one of them exploded, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It quoted an eyewitness as saying there were up to a dozen blasts in all and that at one point one of the vehicles stopped because it was blocked by bodies and handcarts.\n\n\"I heard four or five explosions. I was very scared. I saw three or four people lying on the ground,\" Fang Shaoying, the owner of a small supermarket near the scene of the attack, told The Associated Press by phone.\n\nPhotos from the scene posted to popular Chinese social media site Weibo showed at least three people lying in a street with a large fire in the distance giving off huge plumes of smoke. Others, many of them elderly people who frequent the early-morning market, were sitting in the roadway in shock, with vegetables, boxes and stools strewn around them.\n\nHours afterward, armed paramilitary police and SWAT units patrolled streets surrounding the scene of the attack on Gongyuan North Street near central People's Park. News photographers and videographers were told not to take pictures and were forced to delete their images.\n\nParamilitary troops were deployed all along the street, a hub for grocery stores, restaurants and bars, many of which were closed.\n\nHowever, traffic had resumed and there were no signs of the earlier explosion and fire. Chinese authorities usually attempt to tidy up such scenes and restore normality as quickly as possible.", "title": "Muslim Uighur terrorists kill 31 in Urumqi, China market", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T22:27:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "81Y53G5kWyo", "description": "For more on viscosity check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIxYv1hfckA\n\nCheck out the Official Page: www.cinderblockstudios.com\n\nBecome a Fan on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cinder-Block-Studios-Ben-Yockel/120880797946461", "title": "Everything You Need To Know About: Acrylic Paint Viscosity", "publishedDate": "2013-11-01T11:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "81YERIvC9Tg", "description": "As the Zoisite with rubies came precut I assume other know something more than yet with an intensified nm ( light souce) transformative properties could create a cleaner energy and provide better intergalactic travel .", "title": "4 rod ogdoad resonator light fuscite with rubies repelled turn", "publishedDate": "2014-07-21T08:08:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "81YU3Ck4AMg", "description": "Live performance on Top Of The Pops (UK TV show) in 2001.", "title": "They Might Be Giants - Birdhouse In Your Soul (Live)", "publishedDate": "2008-12-07T05:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "81YeauxvLsQ", "description": "Vancouver hobbyist Amiel De Guzman demonstrates what it's like to safely fly a drone - and what it's like when it crashes", "title": "Piloting a drone  Show and tell   News", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T18:18:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "81ZFM7lxNjE", "description": "Violent clashes break out en route to Mexico City\u2019s international airport as outrage over the 43 missing student teachers boils.

The package came with 2 sponges. I use the Loess Half ball shape Konjac Sponge for face and the Bamboo Charcoal square shape Konjac Sponge for body. \nThey are gentle enough to use twice a day. I saw beautiful results. After about one minute of use I instantly noticed my skin looked radiant and glowing. I've tried many exfoliators and have had troubled skin lately, and this completely renewed my skin. These sponges let you get right up into your pores for a deep clean, or just sweeping softly over your skin to freshen up. \nI definitely don't know how it's managed to keep my blackheads even SLIGHTLY under control which two years of using my Clarisonic have failed to do. And I have no idea how this thing I bought on a whim managed to become one of my favorite cleansing products. I was hesitant at first to use this on the daily as I didn't want to over-exfoliate and break my skin out even more. But these sponges provide just the right about of scrubbiness if you will to deep clean your skin. I even used the sponge to scrub my lips. \nThe sponge in conjunction with my regular cleanser actually manages to remove every bit of makeup. It cleaned all the makeup and dirt off of my face.\nIt also minimizes the amount of cleanser needed with each cleansing! \nThe quality is even better than Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge which I bought from Sephora. I will probably get another Twin Pack from de Prettilicious to keep in my travel kit, because this is a must-have item and very great price.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQR61I2", "title": "MotherStucker's White Hot Video Review:  de PRETTILICIOUS Konjac Sponge", "publishedDate": "2014-08-15T17:50:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "81_zEFx6EeY", "description": "OREDARIA ARTI CONTEMPORANEE\n\nVia Reggio Emilia 22-24 (00198)\n+39 0697601689 , +39 0697601689 (fax)\ninfo@oredaria.it\nwww.oredaria.it\norario: marted\u00ec a venerd\u00ec ore 10 - 13 e 16 - 19.30\nvernissage: 9 ottobre 2012. ore 18.30\ncuratori: Alberto Fiore\nautori: Emily Speed, Esther Stocker, Aeneas Wilder\ngenere: arte contemporanea, collettiva\ncomunicato stampa\nIstintivamente si \u00e8 portati a pensare all'architettura secondo idee derivateci dalla tradizione.

Qui \u00e8 considerata come la strutturazione e traduzione delle proprie idee in entit\u00e0 spaziali fisiche. Portando\nquesta disciplina nel mondo dell'arte si aprono possibilit\u00e0 infinite slegate dai \"doveri di funzionalit\u00e0\". Ogni architettura si relaziona con il nostro corpo che, conseguentemente, \u00e8 soggetto a stimoli nati da questo incontro. Siamo liberi di percepire\nquesti stimoli come pi\u00f9 desideriamo e di tradurli in sensazioni personali. Chi costruisce uno spazio o caratterizza il suo esterno o ancora ne organizza\nl'interno pu\u00f2 condizionare i nostri comportamenti fisici e le nostre sensazioni. Ogni intervento legato al costruire apporta modifiche che, inevitabilmente,\nci coinvolgono fisicamente e psicologicamente.\nPartendo dalla convinzione che siamo soliti notare con particolare attenzione i luoghi e ci\u00f2 che ci trasmettono quando questi si distanziano in\nmodo inaspettato dalle nostre consuetudini percettive, \u00e8 stato chiesto ad Emily Speed, Esther Stocker ed Aeneas Wilder di riflettere su nuove\ninterpretazioni degli spazi, di pensare \"architettonicamente\".\nLa mostra vuole essere una possibilit\u00e0 concreta per partecipare in modo nuovo gli ambienti della galleria, una maniera per scuotere la nostra sensibilit\u00e0\nverso il costruito molto spesso assopita dalla disattenzione ai luoghi in cui ci troviamo. Il lavoro di questi artisti, ognuno con un'identit\u00e0 personale ben\ndistinta, d\u00e0 fisicit\u00e0 a nuove possibili logiche del costruire.\nQuesta esposizione \u00e8 un momento per collezionare esperienze derivate sia dalla relazione fisica ed emozionale con \"gesti architettonici\" nello spazio sia da\nuna libera interpretazione della Psicologia dell'Architettura e dei concetti espressi a riguardo da Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin alla fine del XIX.\nLa ricerca di EMILY SPEED si basa sul rapporto fra il corpo - inteso come edificio - e il suo relazionarsi con l'architettura e sul desiderio\ndell'uomo di edificare malgrado l'inevitabilit\u00e0 del decadimento. Le sue opere fanno uso di materiali semplici, molto spesso di riciclo, anche precari nella\nloro fisicit\u00e0 strutturale.\nFa\u00e7ades (Flats) \u00e8 la concretizzazione fisica di suggestioni architettoniche che l'artista ha estratto dai suoi giorni di visita a Roma e dintorni.

Viene cos\u00ec interpretata la memoria del e sul costruito presente in gran parte degli\nedifici di Roma.\nESTHER STOCKER sviluppa ulteriormente il suo interesse verso le superfici e il tentativo, mentale, di superarle entrando in una struttura.\nAll'aspetto formale si aggiunge sempre quello legato all'interpretazione personale che contraddistingue tutti i \"sistemi immaginativi\" organizzati\ndall'artista.\nIn Einf\u00fchlung le linee parallele abbozzano superfici che impediscono il passaggio fisico attraverso di esse. L'accesso agli ambienti \u00e8 laterale e sfrutta l'open\nspace della galleria. Queste \"pareti\", per\u00f2, non separano nettamente. Lo sguardo trapassa fra i piani, lo spazio \u00e8 filtrato. Si creano come degli interventi\ngrafici di superficie nello spazio, delle visioni di griglie con densit\u00e0 monocromatiche differenti in base alla nostra posizione fisica fra esse.\nIl sovvertimento dei valori del costruire quali durevolezza e sicurezza statica sono invece messi in discussione da AENEAS WILDER. Seppur non\nmanchino occasioni in cui abbia realizzato anche lavori per esterno destinati a durare pi\u00f9 che il solo periodo della mostra, la sua ricerca si basa sull'assunto\ndell'impossibilit\u00e0 di preservare fisicamente qualcosa per l'eternit\u00e0. Il suo lavoro ruota attorno alla transitoriet\u00e0 e temporaneit\u00e0. Le opere nascono da un\naccuratissimo lavoro di precisione, calma e giustapposizione di elementi. Le sue strutture non rappresentano, sono.\nLe due strutture realizzate per la mostra - Untitled # 162 e Untitled # 163 - sono in dialogo transitorio con le forme che caratterizzano l'architettura degli spazi\nespositivi.\nEmily Speed (Chester, 1979) Vive e lavora a Liverpool\nMostre personali (breve selezione)\nExterior Wall Commission, Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool; Flat Pack, Hartington Road Gallery, Londra; MAKE SHIFT, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield (UK); egg, nest, home, country,\nuniverse, Showreel, Milano\nRIPRESA VIDEO : MASSIMO DE PASCALE     \" M.D.P. \"", "title": "SUBJECTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN PHYSICAL SPATIAL ENTITIES OREDARIA ARTI CONTEMPORANEE.m4v", "publishedDate": "2012-10-10T22:24:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "81a7IQrn8Ao", "description": "Having extra-marital affairs is a very norm issues in our Bollywood industry.

The march premiered in Tambov in 1912 and was subsequently released as a single. Slavianka means \"Slavic woman\".\n\nThe melody gained popularity in Russia and adjoining countries during the World War I, when the Russian soldiers left their homes accompanied by this music. It was also used as an unofficial anthem of Admiral Kolchak's White Army.\n\nIt was commonly believed, erroneously, that prior to its use in the award-winning 1957 film The Cranes Are Flying, the song was banned in the Soviet Union due to associations with the tsarist regime and the counter-revolutionary movements. This was not the case. This march was published in an official collection of music for Red Army orchestras, and it was recorded in the early 1940s, by a military orchestra under Ivan Petrov (1906-1975). There are lyrics which are usually sung by the Red Army choir, even today.\n\nSubsequently, several Russian and Polish composers attempted to write lyrics for this music. During the 1990s, the Yabloko party lobbied for the march to be adopted as the National Anthem of Russia, but without success. Currently, the march is recognized as the anthem of the Tambov Oblast. Ships cruising along the Volga and the Rossiya train which runs from Moscow to Vladivostok make use of the tune before departing. Train #2 (named \"Ukraine\" at the time) used to depart from Kiev to Moscow to the sound of this tune.\n\nLyrics in Russian\n\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u043c\u044b \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f. \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043c\u044b \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f.\n\n\u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0442\u044b \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430 - \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u043a \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043b. \u041d\u043e \u0442\u044b \u0436\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 - \u0422\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b! \u041f\u0420\u0418\u041f\u0415\u0412: \u0418 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434! \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442! \u041c\u044b \u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0418 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0439. \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0443, \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f!\n\n\u0416\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u043d\u044f. \u041e\u0442\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c! \u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0418\u043b\u044c\u044f \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044f? \u0421\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430-\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c.\n\n\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041f\u0415\u0412.\n\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u044b - \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u044b, \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u043e\u0442\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0427\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044b \u041d\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f, \u043d\u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432.\n\n\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044c, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0414\u0443\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0437\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0442: \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u0439, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430! \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b \u0438 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430!\n\n\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041f\u0415\u0412.", "title": "Farewell of Slavianka", "publishedDate": "2008-11-28T09:46:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "81bVJIDeCaA", "description": "Bound to tickle your funny bones for a moment!\nBy Sayan Hore (Chotka), Sanhik Hore (Borka), Monojit Hore (Bobin), Aritro Ghosh (Puku), Abhijit Bose (Sahev) and Saptarshi Chatterjee (Rivu).", "title": "India's funniest short videos [Part 3]-Dropkicker Dropkicked", "publishedDate": "2013-01-21T05:17:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "81c44-CDP7E", "description": "", "title": "Sarcasm/Verbal Irony", "publishedDate": "2011-10-18T09:42:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "81c4dMjBmOM", "description": "Chris DeRubeis Abstract Sensualism is a new and dynamic art form.

The first acid reflux disease contributing condition is a retrograde flow of stomach contents into the esophagus. However, the reflux itself does not necessarily lead to gastro-esophageal reflux disease symptoms or histologic changes, and can occur among healthy individuals as well. In this case, the process is referred to as \"physiologic gastroesophageal reflux\".\n\nThe second acid reflux disease predisposing condition is a lower esophageal sphincter (LES) malfunction. The LES is a 3-cm to 4-cm ring of muscle, which is two to three times thicker than the proximal esophagus and acts as a valve between the esophagus and the stomach. In the case of acid reflux disease, the LES does not close perfectly and stomach contents splashes up into the esophagus. When pathologic symptoms follow this process, the whole condition is called acid reflux disease.\n\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease is usually experienced as a persistent (at least twice a week) heartburn. Heartburn is the burning sensation in the chest or throat, caused by refluxed stomach contents touching the lining of the esophagus. Since healthy individuals may also experience light reflux - occasional heartburn is common as well, and doesn't necessarily serve as an evidence of GERD.\n\nSome GERD sufferers may also experience pain in the chest, cough, morning hoarseness, voice changes, difficulty swallowing (especially lumpy foods), chronic earache, burning chest pains, nausea or sinusitis. Some patients report a sensation that reminds food stuck, choking or tightness in the throat. This happens due to continuous stomach contents acid flow that comes into contact with the esophagus and causes inflammation of the esophagus resulting in scars from tissue damage.\n\nUntreated acid reflux disease can lead to serious health complications. Those include stricture formation, bleeding, ulcers and esophageal spasms. When the stomach acid reaches the upper esophagus and trachea, the process can result in a variety of severe conditions, such as asthma, sinusitis and pneumonia. Finally, some people may develop Barrett's esophagus, a condition that manifest in an abnormal shape and color of cells in the esophageal lining. This condition is a precursor to esophageal cancer, especially in adults over 60 years old.\n\nThe treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease takes three forms: surgery, medical therapy and holistic therapy, including dietary and lifestyle changes and the intake of specific herbal supplements. An undergoing surgery should be considered very carefully, since it can compound some underlying conditions, such as stricture and motility disorders. Medical treatment of GERD includes PPIs and H2 blockers. While acid reflux can be treated by taking prescription medications or acid blockers such as the above, bear in mind that the results may be temporary and that some conventional medications can cause serious side effects.\n\nFrom a holistic point of view, acid reflux disease is considered a warning sign of a major internal imbalance that needs to be properly addressed. Therefore, alternative remedies, such as homeopathic remedies, herbal remedies, lifestyle changes as part of a complete holistic regimen are strongly recommended for acid reflux sufferers.\n\n\nThis article is based on the book, \"Heartburn No More\" by Jeff Martin. Jeff is an author, researcher, nutritionist and health consultant who dedicated his life to creating the ultimate acid reflux solution guaranteed to permanently reverse the root cause of heartburn and acid reflux and naturally and dramatically improve the overall quality of your life,  without the use prescription medication and without any surgical procedures.

The PaperTab tablet looks and feels just like a sheet of paper. However, it is fully interactive with a flexible, high-resolution 10.7\" plastic display developed by Plastic Logic, a flexible touchscreen, and powered by the second generation Intel\u00ae Core i5 processor. Instead of using several apps or windows on a single display, users have ten or more interactive displays or \"papertabs\": one per app in use.\n\nRyan Brotman, research scientist at Intel elaborates \"We are actively exploring disruptive user experiences. the 'PaperTab' project, developed by the Human Media Lab at Queen's University and Plastic Logic, demonstrates innovative interactions powered by Intel core processors that could potentially delight tablet users in the future.\"\n\n\"Using several PaperTabs makes it much easier to work with multiple documents,\" says Roel Vertegaal, director of Queen's University's Human Media Lab. \"Within five to ten years, most computers, from ultra-notebooks to tablets, will look and feel just like these sheets of printed color paper.\"\n\n\"Plastic Logic's flexible plastic displays are completely transformational in terms of product interaction. they allow a natural human interaction with electronic paper, being lighter, thinner and more robust compared with today's standard glass-based displays. this is just one example of the innovative revolutionary design approaches enabled by flexible displays.\" explains Indro Mukerjee, CEO of Plastic Logic.\n\nFor more info, see http://www.humanmedialab.org/papertab and come see it at CES 2013 in Las Vegas.", "title": "PaperTab: Revolutionary paper tablet reveals future tablets to be thin and flexible as paper.", "publishedDate": "2013-01-07T00:06:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "81iqLpeuY9I", "description": "check out my best beat yet! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UPu5dWAHZE\nhard rap beat by mad key productions\nrate comment 'n sub,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntgas: hiphop instrumental oldskool sting eminem gangsa beat hloween sex music pedo baby kitteh rwj mgm big", "title": "HIP-HOP INSTRUMENTAL - Gangsta rap beat {hot stringed instumental}", "publishedDate": "2010-10-10T16:53:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "81iyS1mapms", "description": "QUE VEUT LE RWANDA", "title": "FLASH: 3 NOUVEAUX BATTAILLONS RWANDAIS SONT RENTR\u00c9S \u00c0 RUTSHURU ET NYIRAGONGO", "publishedDate": "2013-07-05T16:20:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "81j7-EsvdhI", "description": "honest opinions needed", "title": "Infant MRI after Hydrops HDN ECMO RH factor anemia", "publishedDate": "2009-07-24T07:16:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "81j9Jv7NEDU", "description": "Pall Mall cigarettes August 1966 radio spot", "title": "Pall Mall cigarettes 1966", "publishedDate": "2013-02-25T00:50:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "81jGic-rsK0", "description": "Subscribe http://www.youtube.com/bbcnews\nCheck out our website: http://www.bbc.com/news \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/bbcworldnews \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/bbcworld\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/bbcnews\n\nColin Furze is a maker & and inventor.

The lake is between the provinces of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan in Iran, and west of the southern portion of the Caspian Sea. At its full size, it is the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth largest saltwater lake on earth with a surface area of approximately 5,200 km\u00b2 (2,000 mile\u00b2), 140 km (87 mi) length, 55 km (34 mi) width, and 16 m (52 ft) depth.\nLake Urmia along with its approximately 102 islands are protected as a national park by the Iranian Department of Environment.\nLake Urmia is home to some 212 species of birds, 41 reptiles, 7 amphibians, and 27 species of mammals, including the yellow deer. It is an internationally registered protected area as both a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a Ramsar site. of Environment has designated most of the lake as a \"National Park\".\nThe recent drought has significantly decreased the annual amount of water the lake receives. This in turn has increased the salinity of the lake's water, lowering the lake viability as home to thousands of migratory birds including the large flamingo populations. The salinity has particularly increased in the half of the lake north of the causeway.\nThe lake is marked by more than a hundred small, rocky islands, which serve as stopover points during the migrations of several wild birds including flamingos, pelicans, spoonbills, ibises, storks, shelducks, avocets, stilts, and gulls.\nBy virtue of its high salinity, the lake no longer sustains any fish species. Nonetheless, Lake Urmia is considered a significant natural habitat of Artemia, which serve as food source for the migratory birds such as flamingos. In early 2013, the then-head of the Iranian Artemia Research Center was quoted that Artemia Urmiana had gone extinct due to the drastic increases in salinity. However this assessment has been contradicted.\nThe lake is a major barrier between two of the most important cities in West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan provinces, Urmia and Tabriz. A project to build a highway across the lake was initiated in the 1970s but was abandoned after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, having finished a 15 km causeway with an unbridged gap. The project was revived in the early 2000s, and was completed in November 2008 with the opening of the 1.5 km Urmia Lake Bridge across the remaining gap. The highly saline environment is already heavily rusting the steel on the bridge despite anti-corrosion treatment. Experts have warned that the construction of the causeway and bridge, together with a series of ecological factors, will eventually lead to the drying up of the lake, turning it into a salt marsh which will directly affect the climate of the region. Lake Urmia has been shrinking for a long time, with an annual evaporation rate of 0.6m to 1m (24 to 39 inches). Although measures are now being taken to reverse the trend the lake has shrunk by 60% and could disappear entirely. Only 5% of the lake's water remains.\nEnvironmental rallies\nFrom March 2010, a series of protests and rallies in Iranian Azerbaijan demanded action to save Lake Urmia:\nOn 2 April 2010 and 2011, and after several callings from Tractor Sazi F.C.'s fans in stadiums and internet sites, protest demanding that the government take action to save Lake Urmia was held in Tabriz, Urmia, on the lake beach, and on top of the lake bridge. As a result, dozens of people were arrested by security forces. In August 2011, after the Iranian parliament dropped two emergency cases for reviving the lake, a number of soccer fans at Tabriz derby (soccer match between Tractor Sazi F.C. and Shahrdari Tabriz F.C.) were arrested for shouting slogans in favor of protecting the lake. Later that same week, Iranian Turks scheduled a protest against the parliament move. Despite the capture of more than 20 activists by security forces the day before the protest, numerous people attended the event in Urmia and a number of clashes with police were reported.\nOn 3 September 2011, Iranian Turks demonstrated for second week in a row to protect Lake Urmia. The protests in Tabriz and Urmia reportedly followed parliament's rejection of rescue plan, and security forces used violence to break up environmental rallies as protesters demanded action to save Lake Urmia, and according to West Azerbaijan's governor, at least 60 supporters of the lake were arrested just in Urmia and dozens in Tabriz because, according to an Iranian official, they had not applied for a permit to organize a demonstration. As the protests in Tabriz and other Iranian Azerbaijan cities, Turks resident in Turkey called for the preservation of saltwater Lake Urmia through a peaceful protest that included pouring salt and lying on the street in front of the Iranian Embassy in Ankara.", "title": "Urmiye G\u00f6l\u00fc- Lake Urmia - \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0686\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0647", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T08:13:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "81mutYfEhVg", "description": "Sydney electronic trio Seekae amazed an appreciative crowd of subscribers at the Triple R Performance Space with tracks from their RRR Album of the Week, '+Dome'.

Hierdoor is het schip laag in onderhoud- en brandstofkosten. Verder heet het schip een luikenkap met pontonluiken welke volledig vrij van het ruim gestapeld kunnen worden, hierdoor is de volledige ruimopening vrij voor het laden.\nHet schip wordt gebouwd door Scheepswerf Peters uit Kampen, welke het casco uitbesteed heeft aan zusteronderneming Leda Shipyards in Korcula, Kroati\u00eb.\n Op 5 januari 2011 is het schip gedoopt door Anneke de Bock en aansluitend langsscheeps te water gelaten.

The Foreign Office said it was \"working urgently to verify\" the video and was offering support to Mr Haines's family. The aid worker, 44, from Perth, was kidnapped last year in Syria.\n\nIslamic State (IS) militants have already beheaded two US journalists and threatened to kill Mr Haines if US air strikes in Iraq were not halted.

By 1840, it had disappeared from the wild and was assumed to be extinct. As a grazing species, it somewhat resembled the Aldabra giant tortoise with its domed shape.\nIn 1999, some Seychelles island tortoises (12 known individuals) were suggested to have survived in captivity. The report of oddly shaped captive tortoises prompted the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles to examine the identity of the living tortoises. Examination of museum specimens of the \"extinct\" Seychelles species by Dr. Justin Gerlach and Laura Canning seemed to show some living tortoises possess characteristics of the extinct species. With DNA testing, tortoises of the \"extinct\" species were identified and were acquired by The Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles for conservation.

Ninety-four are found naturally on Earth, and the rest are synthetic elements that have been produced artificially in particle accelerators. Elements 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium) and all elements greater than 83 (bismuth), beginning with 84 (polonium) have no stable isotopes. The atomic mass of each of these element's isotope having the longest half-life is typically reported on periodic tables with parentheses. Isotopes of elements 43, 61, 93 (neptunium) and 94 (plutonium), first discovered synthetically, have since been discovered in trace amounts on Earth as products of natural radioactive decay processes.\nThe primary determinant of an element's chemical properties is its electron configuration, particularly the valence shell electrons. For instance, any atoms with four valence electrons occupying p orbitals will exhibit some similarity. The type of orbital in which the atom's outermost electrons reside determines the \"block\" to which it belongs. The number of valence shell electrons determines the family, or group, to which the element belongs. The total number of electron shells an atom has determines the period to which it belongs. Each shell is divided into different subshells, which as atomic number increases are filled in roughly this order (the Aufbau principle) (see table). Hence the structure of the table. Since the outermost electrons determine chemical properties, those with the same number of valence electrons are grouped together.\n\nProgressing through a group from lightest element to heaviest element, the outer-shell electrons (those most readily accessible for participation in chemical reactions) are all in the same type of orbital, with a similar shape, but with increasingly higher energy and average distance from the nucleus. For instance, the outer-shell (or \"valence\") electrons of the first group, headed by hydrogen, all have one electron in an s orbital. In hydrogen, that s orbital is in the lowest possible energy state of any atom, the first-shell orbital (and represented by hydrogen's position in the first period of the table). In francium, the heaviest element of the group, the outer-shell electron is in the seventh-shell orbital, significantly further out on average from the nucleus than those electrons filling all the shells below it in energy. As another example, both carbon and lead have four electrons in their outer shell orbitals.\n\nNote that as atomic number (i.e., charge on the atomic nucleus) increases, this leads to greater spin-orbit coupling between the nucleus and the electrons, reducing the validity of the quantum mechanical orbital approximation model, which considers each atomic orbital as a separate entity.\n\nThe elements ununtrium, ununquadium, ununpentium, etc. are elements that have been discovered, but so far have not received a trivial name yet. There is a system for naming them temporarily.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Modern Periodic Table", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T06:52:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "82IkaGCITXw", "description": "I love strawberries!

However, neonatal red blood cells transfusion is not without risks. In addition to well-known adverse events, several severe side effects have been observed unique to preterm infants, such as transfusion-related acute gut injury, intraventricular hemorrhage, and increased mortality risk. It is therefore important to reduce the frequency of RBC transfusion in critically ill neonates, by delayed clamping or milking the umbilical cord, using residual cord blood for initial laboratory investigations, reducing phlebotomy losses, determining transfusion guidelines, and ensuring the most appropriate nutrition, with the optimal supplementation of iron, folic acid, and vitamins. Ideally, RBC transfusion should be tailored to the individual requirements of the single infant. However, many controversies still remain, and the decision on whether to transfuse or not is often made on an empirical basis. Recently, a few clinical trials have been performed with the aim to compare the risk/benefit ratio of restrictive versus liberal transfusion criteria. No significant differences in short-term outcomes were observed, suggesting that the restrictive criteria may reduce the need for transfusion and the related side effects. Neurodevelopmental long-term outcome seemed more favorable in the liberal group at first evaluation, especially for boys, and significantly better in the restrictive group at a later clinical investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging scans, performed at an average age of 12 years, showed that intracranial volume was substantially smaller in the liberal group compared with controls. When sex effects were evaluated, the girls in the liberal group had the most significant abnormalities. In conclusion, it would seem preferable to adopt restrictive criteria. Current recommendation on transfusion therapy should be revised to take into account this suggestion.\n\nRead the review paper here:\nhttp://www.dovepress.com/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-preterm-neonates-current-perspectives-peer-reviewed-article", "title": "RBC transfusion in preterm neonates - Video abstract [40026]", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T22:54:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "82oQVanXNIQ", "description": "The new SeaCell\u2122 image film -- all information about SeaCell\u2122 in one film\n\nThe new SeaCell\u2122 image film explains all necessary information about SeaCell\u2122 in a descriptive, informative and clear way.\n\nSelected videos, images and animations show the complete production chain -- from the sustainable harvest of the ascophyllum nodosum seaweed to the gentle further processing up to the finished SeaCell\u2122-fiber.

We track both the user and Spheree to render user-targeted views onto the surface of the sphere. This provides motion parallax, occlusion, shading and perspective depth cues to the user. One of the emerging technologies that makes Spheree unique is that we use multiple mini-projectors, calibrated and blended automatically to create a uniform pixel space on the surface of the sphere. The calibration algorithm we developed allows for as many projectors as needed for virtually any size of sphere, providing a linear scalability cost for higher-resolution spherical displays. Spheree does not have any seams or blind spots, therefore rendered scenes are not occluded and the display can support stereo 3D experiences. Using touch and gesture we support tangible interactions such as moving, rotating, sculpting and painting objects, in addition to object manipulation. Computer generated 3D models or 3D models of real-objects can be imported into Spheree. Once objects are modified within Spheree, our workflow supports export of the modified model to work easily with other applications. At SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies we will exhibit two Spherees (different sizes) to illustrate that calibrated multiple-projector spherical displays represent a future of interactive, scalable, high-resolution, non-planar displays. Participants at Siggraph will have a magical experience with Spheree, demonstrating its use in a 3D design workflow environment.\n\nTo be presented at the Emerging Technologies and Poster sessions of SIGGRAPH 2014:\nFernando Ferreira, Marcio Cabral, Olavo Belloc, Gregor Miller, Celso Kurashima, Rosali de Deus Lopes, Ian Stavness, Junia Anacleto, Marcelo Zuffo and Sidney Fels, ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH 2014), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, August 2014", "title": "Spheree: A 3D Perspective-Corrected Interactive Spherical Scalable Display", "publishedDate": "2014-06-07T18:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "82swXJriCO0", "description": "", "title": "Rye Radiology", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T20:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "82tDl7d_VIc", "description": "Learn about tracing precedent and dependent cells in Microsoft Excel at www.teachUcomp.com.

Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals. The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to E. E. Cummings: the growth of a writer by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes \"He [Cummings] had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\" According to Cummings's widow, however, this is incorrect. She wrote to Friedman: \"you should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.\"\n\nTo which I would also add, \"who really cares\"", "title": "SONG CHALLENGE: E.E.

Public demonstrations first took place on 26 January 2011, but were only a sporadic occurrence until mass protests erupted in Damascus on 15 March.[48] The situation quickly developed into a full-scale nationwide uprising, with protesters demanding the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad and the overthrow of the government. The situation in Syria is part of the Arab Spring, a wave of social upheaval throughout the Arab World demanding greater political freedom and an end to autocracy. Inspired by the successful revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, Syrian protesters have employed the use of tactics such as marches, hunger strikes, rioting, and vandalism, in a sustained campaign of civil resistance aimed at ending nearly five decades of Ba'athist rule.

The title refers to the name bestowed on a piglet soon after his separation from his family, when he finds himself on a strange farm. Confused and sad, Babe is adopted by a friendly dog and slowly adjusts to his new home. Discovering that the fate of most pigs is the dinner table, Babe devotes himself to becoming a useful member of the farm by trying to learn how to herd sheep, despite the skepticism of the other animals and the kindly but conventional Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). Because technically impeccable animatronics and computer graphics allow the farm animals to converse easily among themselves, first-time director Chris Noonan can treat the film's menagerie as actual characters, playing scene not for cuteness but for real emotions. The result is often surprisingly touching, with Noonan and George Miller's script, based on Dick King-Smith's children's book and, indirectly, a true story, seamlessly combining gentle whimsy and sincere feeling. These same qualities are embodied by in Cromwell's beautifully understated performance as Farmer Hoggett, which anchors the film. Despite its unlikely premise and low profile, Babe's inspirational story was embraced by audiences and critics, and the movie became an international sleeper that won an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It was followed in 1999 by the less successful Babe: Pig in the City.\n\nbabe,\"babe clip\",\"babe styx\",\"babe ruth\",\"david webb\",\"chris noonan\",\"baby bottle videos\",\"hat videos\",\"ages 11-12\",\"ages 5-7\",\"ages 8-10\",\"animal tales\",\"children family\",\"family comedies\",\"family features\",fantasy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"george miller\",\"bill miller\",\"doug mitchell\",\"catherine barber\",\"daphne paris\",\"philip hearnshaw\",\"commitment videos\",\"compassion videos\",\"farm videos\",\"house videos\",\"kitchen videos\",\"living room videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++134903,/m/0gy6mqj", "title": "Babe (6/9) Movie CLIP - A Dance for Babe (1995) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-27T20:25:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "83NKNA7Fj8c", "description": "Reaching legal speeds up to 35 mph (though generally closer to 20 mph), electric bicycles are an option for many commutes.

the completion and beginning of the annual cycle of weekly Torah readings. The final parashah (portion) of the Hebrew Bible (known as V'zot Habrachah in the Book of Deuteronomy) is read from the Torah and is immediately followed by the reading of the first portion of the Book of Genesis, Bereishit.\n\nThe Torah-reading ritual on Simchat Torah is characterized by the hakafot service. Jews dance with Torah scrolls in hakafot (literally, \"circles\") in the synagogue and on the streets outside. Simchat Torah is considered a kid-friendly Jewish holiday, and it is not uncommon to find children with flags and banners perched on parents' shoulders throughout the festivities. Dancing while holding the Torah is considered a great honor on this holiday. In congregations with multiple sets of scrolls, Torahs are passed from one person to the next during the dancing.\n\nKabbalists (Jewish mystics) have a thing for the number seven. Among other things, there are seven days of Sukkot, the holiday that precedes Simchat Torah. Hakafot dancing occurs seven times during Simchat Torah services. A set of 17 verses is read -- in some congregations it is repeated three times in each of the seven hakafot -- and then the dancing begins anew. Each of the seven dances is associated with the seven divine emanations (known as sephirot in Kabbalah) in the physical world: kindness, judgment, harmony, victory, splendor, foundation and kingship. While each day of Sukkot has a similar association, on Simchat Torah all of these aspects are united on one day. Jews dance in circles on Simchat Torah to acknowledge this unity.", "title": "Music of Ancient Israel - Simchat Torah", "publishedDate": "2013-09-28T16:24:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "83UO_U5KD-w", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez \u00ab Chronic Venous Disease, an inflammatory disease  \u00bb, un documentaire propos\u00e9 par les Laboratoires Servier autour de l'inflammation veineuse\n \nDans cette vid\u00e9o, Servier explique les m\u00e9canismes de l'inflammation douloureuse des parois veineuses et des tissus avoisinants. \n \nSuivez toute l'actualit\u00e9 des innovations scientifiques au service de la sant\u00e9, rendez-vous sur http://www.servier-techblog.com/", "title": "Lumi\u00e8re sur l'inflammation veineuse chronique - Servier TechBlog", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T16:56:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "83UPa3rYUwo", "description": "Bum bum. \n1 million views.

It should not be confused with Malpighia glabra, wild crepemyrtle, also known as Acerola. These flowering trees are beautifully colored and are often planted both privately and commercially. Popular varieties used in modern landscaping include the bright red Dynamite Crape Myrtle, the deep pink Pink Velour Crape and the purple Twilight Crape Myrtle, which also has a bark that changes colors. These trees come in many different hues, as outlined on the Crape Myrtle Comparison Chart\n\nSource: Wikipedia.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It has also been introduced in many other parts of the world.Two small groups of spines, perfecperfectly separated from each other, above each tympanum. Dorsal crest moderately elevated on the neck and anterior part of the trunk, extending on to the root of the tail in large individuals, and gradually disappearing on the middle of the trunk in younger ones. No fold in front of the shoulder, but the scales behind the lower jaw are much smaller than the others; gular sac not developed. From thirty-nine to forty-three series of scales round the middle of the trunk. The hind foot (measured from the heel to the extremity of the fourth toe) is not much longer than the head in the adult, whilst it is considerably longer in the young. The coloration is very variable, sometimes uniform brownish or greyish-olive or yellowish. Generally broad brown bands across the back, interrupted by a yellowish lateral band. Black streaks radiate from the eye, and some of them are continued over the throat, running obliquely backwards, belly frequently with greyish longitudinal stripes, one along the median line being the most distinct; young and half-grown specimens have a dark, black-edged band across the inter-orbital region.\nThe ground-colour is generally a light brownish olive, but the lizard can change it to bright red, to black, and to a mixture of both. This change is sometimes confined to the head, at other times diffused over the whole body and tail. A common state in which it may be seen (as stated by Mr. Jerdon) is, seated on a hedge or bush, with the tail and limbs black, head and neck yellow picked out with red, and the rest of the body red. Jerdon and Blyth agree that these bright, changeable colours are peculiar to the male during the breeding-season, which falls in the months of May and June.\nMouhot has collected in Siam one of those fine variations of colours, which, however, appear to be infinite. It has the usual cross streaks between the eyes and the radiating lines continent of India to China; it is very common in Ceylon, not extending into the temperate zone of the Himalayas. Ceylonese specimens are generally somewhat larger; one of them measured 16 inches, the tail taking 11 inches. It is found in hedges and trees; it is known in Ceylon under the name of \"Bloodsucker\", a designation the origin of which cannot be satisfactorily traced; in the opinion of Kelaart, the name was given to it from the occasional reddish hue of the throat and neck. The female lays from five to sixteen soft oval eggs, about 5/8 of an inch long, in hollows of trees, or in holes in the soil which they have burrowed, afterward covering them up. The young appear in about eight or nine weeks. In a hot sunny day a solitary Bloodsucker may be seen on a twig or on a wall, basking in the sun, with mouth wide open. After a shower of rain numbers of them arc seen to come down on the ground and pick up the larva and small insects which fall from the trees during the showers.During the breeding season, the male's head and shoulders turns bright orange to crimson and his throat black. Males also turn red-headed after a successful battle with rivals. Thus their other gruesome name of \"Bloodsucker Lizard\" although they don't actually suck anybody's blood. Both males and females have a crest from the head to nearly the tail, hence their other common name \"Crested Tree Lizard\".\nChangeable Lizards are related to iguanas (which are found only in the New World). Unlike other lizards, they do not drop their tails (autotomy), and their tails can be very long, stiff and pointy. Like other reptiles, they shed their skins. Like chameleons, Changeable Lizards can move each of their eyes in different .Distribution The native range of the species includes SE Iran,Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India (including the Andaman Islands and particularly common in mainland India), Sri Lanka (Ceylon), Myanmar, Thailand, Western Malaysia, Maldives, Vietnam, Pulo Condore Island, South China (Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hongkong, Hainan Island), Indonesia (Sumatra), Mauritius (Reunion, Rodrigues). It has been introduced to Oman, Singapore, and United States. The lizards were introduced to Singapore from Malaysia and Thailand in the 1980s. In Singapore, they are a threat to the native Green-Crested Lizard.[3] The Changeable Lizard is relatively common and found in a wide range of habitats. They appear to adapt well to humans and are thus not endangered.", "title": "Oriental Garden Lizard, Eastern Garden Lizard or Changeable Lizard (Calotes versicolor)", "publishedDate": "2007-10-01T07:55:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "84-hAhYarH8", "description": "This video shows how the Grid-In-Hand(tm) Mobile Grid app on the iPad, can be used with the Scanfob GEN2 RFID reader to easily capture UHF RFID tags and email them as an Excel spreadsheet.\nThe RFID reader is connected to the iPad via the BlueSnap (SPP-HID) Bridge.  One side of the bridge is connected to the RFID reader (in Bluetooth SPP mode), the other side of the bridge is connected to the iPad (in Bluetooth HID-keyboard mode).\nThe BlueSnap Bridge has a rechargeable battery, and is a convenient size so it can fit in most any pocket while in use. It only needs be within 30 feet of the iPad and the RFID reader. \nThis system is fast, simple, and easy-to-use. Simply turn on the RFID reader and the bridge, and in a few seconds you will have the reader connected to the iPad. To read the tags, hold the reader near the tag, and press the read button, the tag value will be posted to the Mobile Grid, in this case the time of the scan also posted, there are options to collect other data as well. When all the tags are captured, tap the upload option. It's that easy to have a list of GEN2 tags emailed anywhere as an Excel file, CSV file, and even posted to a SQL database.\n\nThis solution can post the UHF tag data to ANY iPad application that accepts typed data, such as the Safari Browser, just open the app and scan the tag to the desired location. Also note the bridge allows you to have on-screen keyboard access with the reader connected, just briefly press the bridge button, to display or hide the iPad on-screen keyboard.\n\nThe BlueSnap Bridge can connect RFID readers, barcode scanners, mag stripe readers, scales, sensors, laser range finders, and more to the iPad. The device needs a Bluetooth SPP or RS-232 interface that sends regular text & number data (ASCII format), so this solution is incredibly flexible.\n\nFor more information on this UHF GEN2 RFID solution, and many other mobile wireless solutions, on hundreds of models of mobile devices, please contact Serialio.com.

It is the preferred NSAID for long-term use in people with a high risk of cardiovascular (for example, heart attacks or strokes) complications, due to its relatively low risk of causing such complications. Naproxen has an intermediate risk of causing stomach ulcers as compared with ibuprofen, which is low risk, and indometacin, which is high risk. In order to reduce the risk of stomach ulceration, it is often combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (a medication that reduces the production of stomach acid) during long-term treatment, in those with pre-existing stomach ulcers, or a history of developing stomach ulcers while on NSAIDs.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nNaproxen.png from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Naproxen.png\n\nAsymmetric_hydrogenation_to_naproxen.png from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Asymmetric_hydrogenation_to_naproxen.png\n\nLarge-Scale_Synthesis_of_S-naproxen.png from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Large-Scale_Synthesis_of_S-naproxen.png", "title": "All About - Naproxen", "publishedDate": "2014-10-11T14:28:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "841bIdxMXsI", "description": "Video of all the \"Elevens\".

The series was created under the leadership of Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York. The concept of a reading series for children was inspired by Twila Liggett, Ph.D., of Lincoln, Nebraska of the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln; Paul Schupbach, director of the Great Plains National Instructional Television LIbrary; and Tony Buttino, of WNED-TV Buffalo, New York. The original team included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and LeVar Burton as host.\n\nEach episode centers on a theme from a book or other children's literature which is explored through a number of segments or stories. The show also provides book recommendations for kids to look for when they go to the library.

Libra is an air sign meaning that it lives in its fancy and it's a sense that life can be magic. Libra loves attention, loves to seek after something that's glamorous, something that is attention getting, as well as something that makes them feel pampered and as though they are being sought after and loved by the world. That basically is why a Libran is very social and why a Libran loves to get out into the world. \n\nSagittarius is also a sign of passion, passions of the mind and body. But basically, Sagittarius's passion is for freedom, for adventure, to lead a life that is spontaneous, that gives them a sense that the world is large, and they can leap almost anywhere they want. \n\nSo, the energies of both a Libran who is social and very oriented toward others and a Sagittarian - who is also oriented toward others because Sagittarius learns and experiences different cultures that way - work well. It may be for different reasons that they both love getting out into a wider world, but because they both do they both have a strong structure, in a sense. \n\nNot that it's a structure in which they are imprisoned, but they have a strong center that can hold them. Basically, Libran loves being in a relationship. Libra is the sign of partnership, and Sagittarius loves having a partner in adventure. \n\nWhere things might break down a little has to do with more the mental aspects of this. As emotional partners, neither of them are particularly heavy in their emotions. But they do have sensitive and caring, and giving feelings. But in the thinking processes, what Sagittarius looks for is to be very free and independent and what Libra looks for is to have a partner.\n\nSo they may have to work out a little bit of, oh, let's say energies there about togetherness - how much togetherness is suffocating and how much togetherness is a companionship.", "title": "Are Libra & Sagittarius Compatible? | Zodiac Love Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-03-07T02:18:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "84BfhQ-TW1s", "description": "An extensive colony of terrestrial Rose Pogonia orchids (Pogonia ophioglossoides) in flower in the Apalachicola National Forest", "title": "Rose Pogonias Blooming on a Wet Roadside", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T13:30:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "84BfnPZQLSk", "description": "el \u00e1rbol mas grueso del mundo\nNombre com\u00fan: Ahuehuete o Sabino\nNombre t\u00e9cnico: Taxodium Mucronatum (ten)\nFamilia: Taxodiacea\nG\u00e9nero: Taxodium\nEdad: M\u00e1s de 2,000 a\u00f1os\nGrosor: 58 metros\nAltura: 42 metros\nDi\u00e1metro: 14.05 metros\nVolumen: 816,829 metros cubicos\nPeso: 636,107 toneladas", "title": "Visitando M\u00e9xico Santa Mar\u00eda del Tule Oaxaca", "publishedDate": "2014-10-03T18:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "84Bn3pPdAs4", "description": "shotabon", "title": "shotabon", "publishedDate": "2006-07-11T03:07:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "84CKswo_XDw", "description": "", "title": "Gatti miao!", "publishedDate": "2013-08-31T13:44:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "84Cd7-Pdh7o", "description": "shinee everybody performance by jet lagger member", "title": "jet lagger 11/24 lesson #1", "publishedDate": "2013-11-24T05:11:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "84CrbllfwA4", "description": "FP4BATIW is a coordination and support action addressed to foster partnerships and networking for best available water treatment technologies implementation in the MPC region by promoting the interaction between highly qualified members, both from EU and Mediterranean Partner Countries, of the knowledge value chain on water treatment and corresponding stake holders community. \n\nFP4BATIW will promote the employment of water treatment technologies pilot plant demonstrations and real case studies achieved under former or on-going EU-FP7 projects with MPC participation to substantiate pre-competitive research in the water sector in the region, with particular regard to develop innovative business models focused on generating water saving and multi-use solutions. \n\nThe Project is funded by the European Commission under the 7th European Framework Programme - Activities for International Cooperation of the Capacities Programme.", "title": "FP4BATIW", "publishedDate": "2014-03-25T10:30:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "84DYq9sbXXs", "description": "be careful with acid.....it can burn your skin", "title": "revive lead acid battery", "publishedDate": "2013-01-21T10:59:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "84DYxZErwtA", "description": "Leslie Ungar, communication expert, President of Electric Impulse Communications, discusses why use a speech writer. \n\nSite: http://www.electricimpulse.com/ \nTestimonials: http://www.electricimpulse.com/testimonials/ \nArticles: http://www.electricimpulse.com/resources/ \nResults: http://www.electricimpulse.com/client-results/", "title": "Why Use a Speech Writer?", "publishedDate": "2011-05-25T00:47:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "84DaMkjV1RM", "description": "CACHORRO MACHO BOXER ATIGRADO", "title": "BART DE LA NARANJILLA", "publishedDate": "2008-10-04T20:18:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "84Df1_epseY", "description": "MTConvention.com", "title": "Rt.

Its common names include passion fruit (US), passionfruit (UK and Commonwealth), and purple granadilla (South Africa).\n\nIt is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet, seedy fruit and is widely grown in several countries of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, Southern Asia, Australia, Hawaii and United States.\n\nThe passion fruit is round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds.  The fruit is both eaten and juiced; passion fruit juice is often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma.\n\nSeveral distinct varieties of passion fruit with clearly differing exterior appearances exist. The bright yellow flavicarpa variety, also known as the Golden Passion Fruit, can grow up to the size of a grapefruit, has a smooth, glossy, light and airy rind, and has been used as a rootstock for the Purple Passion Fruit in Australia.  The dark purple edulis variety is smaller than a lemon, though it is less acidic than the yellow passion fruit, and has a richer aroma and flavour.\n\nSeveral varieties of passion fruit are rich in polyphenol content, and yellow varieties of the fruit were found to contain prunasin and other cyanogenic glycosides in the peel and juice.\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.
