Sylvain Chomet, the Oscar-nominated and critically acclaimed creator of The Triplets of Belleville, adapted the script and brought it to life in his distinctive hand-drawn animated style.\n\nThe Illusionist is one of a dying breed of stage entertainers. With emerging rock stars stealing his thunder in the late 1950s, he is forced to accept increasingly obscure assignments in fringe theatres, at garden parties and in bars and caf\u00e9s. Then, while performing in a village pub off the west coast of Scotland, he encounters Alice, an innocent young girl, who will change his life forever.\nWatching his performance for the excited villagers who are celebrating the arrival of electricity on their remote island, Alice is awestruck by his show and believes his tricks are real magic. Though they don\u201ft speak the same language, the two lonely strangers quickly bond through small kindnesses. Fascinated by The Illusionist, Alice stows away on his departing ship and follows him to Edinburgh. There, they quickly fall into a father -- daughter relationship, with Alice keeping their home at a boarding house for vaudevillians, while he goes to work in a small local theatre.\n3\nEnchanted by her enthusiasm for his act, The Illusionist rewards Alice with increasingly lavish gifts he has 'conjured' into existence. Desperate not to disappoint her, he cannot bring himself to reveal that magic does not exist and that he\u201fs driving himself to ruin working all night jobs to buy her gifts.\nAs The Illusionist grows older, Alice grows up. She falls in love with a young man and is no longer so enchanted by The Illusionist\u201fs conjuring. She moves on with her life, and The Illusionist no longer has to pretend.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.\n\nSource :-Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Also cited were two Christian ministers -- Dwayne Black, pastor of The Sanctuary Church in Fort Lauderdale, and Mark Sims of St. Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church in Coral Springs.\nAll three men face up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine.\nOne of the police officers said, 'Drop that plate right now,' as if I were carrying a weapon,\" said Abbott, who runs a nonprofit group called Love Thy Neighbor, Inc. \"It's man's inhumanity to man is all it is.\"\nIn 1999, the city tried to stop Abbott from feeding the homeless on Fort Lauderdale Beach, prompting a lawsuit from Abbott, which he won. Now he said he will fight the municipal ordinance charge and be forced to take the city back to court.\n\"I\u2019m going to have to go to court again and sue the city of Fort Lauderdale -- a beautiful city,\" said Abbott. \"These are the poorest of the poor, they have nothing, they don't have a roof over their heads. How do you turn them away?\"\nAbbott said he won't turn them away and is planning to bring food to the beach this Wednesday evening with the expectation that he may be hit with another charge.\n\"I don't do things to purposefully aggravate the situation,\" said Abbott. \"I'm trying to work with the city.

Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.\n\nDota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the \"Ancient\", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.\n\nDevelopment of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded its rewarding gameplay, enhanced production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players\n\nGAMEPLAY : \nDota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. The player may command a single controllable character called a \"Hero\", which is chosen from a selection pool of 108. Each Hero begins the match at level one but may become more powerful by accumulating experience through combat, thereby leveling up. With every level gained\u2014the maximum is twenty-five\u2014the player may either select a new ability for their Hero to learn or enhance their general statistics. The Hero's methods of combat are influenced by their primary property \u2013 Strength, Agility, or Intelligence.\n\nDota 2 features a host of items, which the player may store in a small inventory. Said items may be acquired predominantly through purchase by gold, the in-game currency. Items vary in function: some enhance the statistics of a Hero, while others grant additional abilities. The player automatically receives small increments of gold continuously, though they can obtain more by destroying enemies. Killing non-player characters grants gold only to the player who lands the final blow, whereas killing enemy Heroes grants gold to the player's nearby allies as well. Destroying Towers or killing Roshan gives gold to all players on the team. \"Denying\" is a feature of the game where players inhibit the enemy's ability to accumulate gold and experience by killing an allied unit or destroying an allied structure before the enemy can do so. \"Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (Video Game)\" \"Warcraft III: Reign Of Chaos (Video Game)\"", "title": "Dota 2 - #Chateados #81 - TECHIES RAMPAGE!", "publishedDate": "2014-09-09T06:49:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BMxhcuB2438", "description": "http://www.rallysportdirect.com/Invidia-Q300-Cat-Back-Exhaust-Titanium-Tips-Subaru-Sedan-WRX-STI-2011&src=6dl8jqir \n\nHere are a few clips of RallySport Direct's 2011 STi with the Invidia Q300 Cat Back Exhaust.

Other people said yes, antimatter rockets, that's the way to go, and we all had this mental vision of the Enterprise going to the nearby star systems. . . . There is another way to do it.  Think of Mother Nature.  When Mother Nature wants to propagate life, one possibility is to send out seeds, not just one or two, but millions of seeds.  Most of the seeds never make it, but one or two do and as a consequence that's how trees in forests propagate.  So why not create a nano ship using nanotechnology?  How big would it be?  Some people like Paul Davies say it could be as big as a bread box.  Other people say it could be even smaller than that.  Why not something the size of a needle?  And because they're so small it wouldn't take much to accelerate them to near the speed of light.  \n\nRealize that a very small tabletop accelerator can accelerate electrons to near the speed of light, so it wouldn't take much for us to accelerate nano molecules to very, very fast velocities near the speed of light using electric fields.  Now these probes would be different from ordinary probes.  They would be nanobots.  They would have the ability to land on a hostile terrain and create a factory just like a virus.  That's what viruses do.  They replicate.  One virus can create maybe a thousand copies, then a thousand, thousand copies and then a million, billion, trillion and all of the sudden you have trillions of these things propagating through outer space.  And how would you do it?  One possibility is to use the field, magnetic fields around Jupiter.  Calculations have shown that you can whip around Jupiter using what is called the Faraday Effect to whip particles to perhaps near the speed of light.\n\nAnd again, we don't have these nanobots yet.  We have to wait until nanotechnology becomes sufficiently developed, but when that happens perhaps the 100 year starship is not going to look like the Enterprise.  Perhaps it will look like tiny, little needles by the billions sent into outer space and maybe only a handful of them land on a distant moon to create factories.  And doesn't that sound familiar?  This is the plotline of the movie 2001.  Remember that gigantic obelisk on Mars?  That was the von Neumann probe, a virus, a self-replicating probe that can then explore the universe near the speed of light. \n\nDirected / Produced by\nJonathan Fowler & Elizabeth Rodd", "title": "Michio Kaku: The von Neumann Probe (A Nano Ship to the Stars)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-18T15:27:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "BN-MR6zQWNQ", "description": "At 3PL we providing physical Warehousing and Logistics support to businesses large and small, helping you to manage \"ON\" your business -- not \"IN\" it.", "title": "General Warehousing", "publishedDate": "2014-05-02T08:06:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "BN-ceEeOwns", "description": "Buck Knives Carbon Fiber Nobleman mfg# 327CFS, unboxing video.

Most bodybuilders have disproportionately bigger front delts in comparison to the rear deltoid muscles due to an over-emphasis on pressing exercises.\n\nThe second is for injury prevention. This imbalanced rear delt/front delt development also causes the shoulder joint to roll forward and out of optimal positioning which can increase the chances of shoulder injury.\n\nOne great exercise to combat this imbalance are bent over rear delt raises, also known as the \"rear lateral raise\". These help you directly isolate the rear deltoid for balanced shoulder development and a stable shoulder joint.\n\nAlthough these appear simple on the surface, here are two key points you'll want to employ when it comes to proper rear deltoid raise form in order to see the greatest benefits...\n\n#1 - Perform the cable rear delt raise variation rather than the dumbbell lateral raise variation. Using a cable allows for consistent tension on the rear delt muscles throughout the entire range of motion, whereas dumbbells only produce significant tension in the top half due to the force of gravity.\n\n#2 - Don't allow your shoulder blades to retract as you raise the weight up. Instead, let your arm hang forward and keep your upper back flat. When you retract your shoulder blades the tension is moved off of the rear deltoid muscles and onto the upper back instead.\n\nApply these two tips to your bent over rear delt raises and you'll notice an immediate improvement in your ability to stimulate these muscles effectively. I'd suggest combining these with face pulls as these are the two best rear deltoid exercises out there.\n\n\n** Get Your Free 28-Day Fast Mass Building Plan:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com/28-Day-Mass-Plan\n\n** Connect With Me On Facebook:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.Facebook.com/SeanNalewanyjOfficial\n\n** Follow All Of My Latest Articles, Tips & Recommendations:\n\u25ba\u25ba http://www.SeanNal.com", "title": "Bent Over Rear Delt Raises: 2 Critical Tips", "publishedDate": "2013-01-10T04:01:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNCenv7wPFE", "description": "Zombie Panic: Zombies Ate my Neighbors Music", "title": "Zombie Panic: Zombies Ate my Neighbors Music", "publishedDate": "2008-04-24T22:23:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNCjtpNzfyE", "description": "", "title": "Bump   Daydream Song From Bump (1970)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T19:56:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNCyx1EdoGg", "description": "10 Ton Foot 9 (1st time played) Disco Biscuits Lupos theater Rhode Island", "title": "10 Ton Foot (1st time played) Disco Biscuits Lupos theater", "publishedDate": "2007-06-23T16:02:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNCzh96-26A", "description": "Foraging workers of bumblebee (Bombus hypocrita, family Apidae) visiting white flowers of false goat's beard (Astilbe thunbergii var. thunbergii, family Saxifragaceae) for buzz pollination (or sonication).

Their diets include a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables. In the wild, they feed primarily on seeds, fruits and greens, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects.[2] They have an elongated pouch on each side of their heads that extends to their shoulders, which they stuff full of food to be stored, brought back to the colony or to be eaten later.\n \nHamster behavior varies depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people. Because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.

As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.[2] Metropolitan areas, include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\nA metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration (the contiguous, built-up area) with zones not necessarily urban in character, but closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt, and may extend well beyond the urban zone, to other political entities. For example, El Monte, California is considered part of the Los Angeles' metro area in the United States.\nIn practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan area should take this into account. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions.\nThere has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950,[4] although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected.[5] Because of the fluidity of the term \"metropolitan statistical area,\" the term used colloquially is more often \"metro service area,\" \"metro area,\" or \"MSA\" taken to include not only a city, but also surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all which it is presumed to influence.\nA polycentric metropolitan area is one not connected by continuous development or conurbation, which requires urban contiguity. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus that other areas have a high degree of integration with.\nSource-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "title": "An Evening at a metropolitan.", "publishedDate": "2013-11-20T22:11:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNR4uDgko_M", "description": "Beatport:\nhttp://www.beatport.com/release/last-dance/1126403\n\nItunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/es/album/last-dance-feat.-odille-lima/id667578290\n\nhttp://javireina.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/javireinaoficial\nhttps://twitter.com/DjJaviReina\nhttps://soundcloud.com/javireina", "title": "Supermartxe, Javi Reina & Rousseau - Last Dance (feat.

Dilapidated Herrington High is the location for a story about a school faculty taken over by outer-space creatures, forcing the students to take charge and kick some alien butt. School faculty members (Robert Patrick, Bebe Neuwirth, Salma Hayek, and Jon Stewart) are infested with rapidly reproducing space worms that take over their minds and bodies. But never fear, because at this school, between hazing the student body and having sex in the locker room, a Scooby-Doo-ish group of high school students is ready to fight back. The up-and-coming acting talent includes R&B singer Usher Raymond, Elijah Wood, Clea DuVall, Josh Hartnett, Shawn Hatosy, Laura Harris, and Jordanna Brewster. The story is nearly irrelevant, as the real stars are the action and lots of special effects.\n\n\"the faculty\",\"the faculty clip\",\"the faculty part 1\",\"the faculty soundtrack\",\"josh hartnett\",\"elijah wood\",\"jon stewart\",\"clea duvall\",\"laura harris\",\"usher raymond\",\"rubber glove videos\",\"teeth videos\",\"alien sci-fi\",horror,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"teen screams\",\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"elizabeth avellan\",\"robert rodriguez\",\"bill scott\",\"tamara smith\",\"discovery videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++174235,/m/01kgv4,/m/01trhmt,/m/01j7rd,/m/015t56,/m/01y9xg,/m/041bly", "title": "The Faculty (1/11) Movie CLIP - A New Species (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-26T15:12:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNXXuLYX5F0", "description": "Retrouvez les buts et les actions marquantes du 16es de finale de Coupe de France entre Lens et Bastia (2-1)", "title": "Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de Lens - Bastia en Coupe de France (2-1)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T16:18:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNXn7IUTPJU", "description": "Black Light Theatre Image in Prague", "title": "Black Light Theater Image in Prag", "publishedDate": "2009-01-31T02:25:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNXzeFCnrfQ", "description": "Louise.

It is located at an average elevation of 6,710 ft (2,050 m)[1] in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region on the Darjeeling-Jalapahar range that originates in the south from Ghum. The range is Y-shaped with the base resting at Katapahar and Jalapahar and two arms diverging north of the Observatory Hill. The north-eastern arm dips suddenly and ends in the Lebong spur, while the north-western arm passes through North Point and ends in the valley near Tukver Tea Estate.[25] The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak, 8,598 m (28,209 ft) high, is the most prominent mountain visible. In days clear of clouds, Nepal's Mount Everest, 29,029 ft (8,848 m) high, can be seen.[26]\n\nThe hills of Darjeeling are part of the Mahabharat Range or Lesser Himalaya. The soil is chiefly composed of sandstone and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of Himalaya. However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose topsoil, leading to frequent landslides during the monsoons. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV, (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes.", "title": "The Darjeeling beauty road in india", "publishedDate": "2014-07-07T15:31:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "BNi1wsugCHc", "description": "Jenn had some drinks before, during, and after the show.

Each of its singles have moved the masses, from the emotional 'Not Giving Up On Love' and energetic 'Drowning' to the hard-rocking 'Full Focus' and seductive 'Feels So Good'. 'Orbion' is one of the jewels of this masterpiece . \n\nOnce it's captured you, you'll find yourself taken on a trip, deep into captivating trance sounds. Uplifting with a dark sense. 'Orbion' is a great example of the traditional, characteristic Armin sound, combined with today's influences.\nOn remix duties, New York producer Eco brings us an all-shattering, uplifting mix that combines an electrifying melody with a solid, deep beat. Shining an extra light on the angelic backing-vocals of 'Orbion', makes the break of his remix a real highlight moment. \n\nIf you're looking for a more prog-trancy translation, get lost into the melodic maze of the Max Graham vs Protoculture remix. A powerful addition to the original! \n\nTracklist:\n1. Orbion (Radio Edit)\n2. Orbion (Extended Version)\n3. Orbion (Max Graham vs Protoculture Remix)\n4.

Today's recipe calls for just a few simple ingredients and it will rival any steak on any restaurant menu.\n\nLet's go over a few tips about steak cuts and beef tenderloin. The USDA top three grades of beef are prime, choice and select. Only about 2-3 percent of the beef sold in the U.S. is prime, which also has the most marbling.\n\nWhat is marbling? When choosing your steaks, pay close attention to the marbling. Marbling is the little flakes of fat within the muscle. When steaks are cooked at a high temperature, the marbling melts, creating a tender, juicy steak. The more marbling a steak has, the better it will taste.\n\nThe beef tenderloin is a non weight-bearing muscle, which receives very little exercise and is why it's so tender. There is only 4-6 pounds of beef tenderloin per steer, which is another reason it's so expensive.\n\nBeef Tenderloin with Marsala and Shallot Pan Jus\n\n2 beef tenderloin steaks\nSea salt\nFresh cracked pepper\n\nSauce: \n1/2 cup water\n1 teaspoon tomato paste\n1/4 cup Marsala wine\n1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n\nTo finish:\n1 small shallot, minced and set aside\n1 tablespoon butter, set aside\n\nMix sauce ingredients (except for shallot and butter) in a bowl and set aside. \n\nPreheat pan on high. Add 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Add steaks and lower heat to medium. Turn steaks after 3-5 minutes. To sear edges, set steaks on their side. Check doneness of the other side after 3-5 minutes. The steaks will continue to cook once you remove them \u2014 a term known as carry-over cooking.\n\nRemove steaks, and using the same pan, add diced shallots to pan. Scrape the meat off the bottom of the pan. Add sauce mix and turn pan back to high. Cook until it has reduced by half. Next, finish the sauce and add 1 tablespoon of butter to the sauce. This will help thicken it a bit more and give the sauce a nice shine.\n\nServe on top homemade french fries and top steak with your homemade sauce. When I served this steak for our neighbors, they said they could have practically cut it with their finger.\n\nEnjoy!

If you're like most people, you want to be at your best because deep down you know you can't bring out the best in others if you're not on that same wavelength.\n\nA great way to get on track is to ask yourself the pointed question of whether something is adding value to your life. An even more helpful question often spawns from this and that is - if it's not adding value, why are you still breathing power into it by allowing it to stay in your life?\n\nThe frankness in this question can be jarring and eye-opening. It is perhaps one of the most important questions a person can ask, though. Life is so short and too precious to waste energy, time, resources on those things and those people who aren't bringing out the very best in you.\n\nI would even stretch to look at it this way: you're doing the world a great disservice by not surrounding yourself with those things and those people who help you to put your best efforts forward.\n\nImprove your life, and you also help to improve the lives of those around you.\n\nSo what do you do if you discover you are surrounded by things, activities, and people who are compromising your ability to rise to your highest level?\n\n\n\nImprove Your Life by Eliminating Bad Habits\n\nBad habits can drag you down. Period. If your actions are not lifting you to higher ground, then they're burying the very best in you. This sounds harsh. Often the things people want to hold onto the most, are the ones they want to protect the most. But, in protecting, they're inadvertently hurting themselves and possibly others.\n\nImprove Your Life by Learning to Say No\n\nAre you stretched to full capacity, leaving no room for new opportunities? Do you have a hard time saying no to requests that aren't exactly in alignment with your greatest assets, dreams, and desires? If yes, then you're compromising those very ideals that make you so unique and valuable. It's okay to say no.\n\nImprove Your Life by Letting Go\n\nAre you holding on to a relationship out of fear, comfort, or guilt? Are the people you surround yourself with helping you to grow? Or are they stunting your growth by holding you back from enriching your life through new pursuits? Letting go of relationships that aren't healthy any longer can be hard because of feelings of guilt, loneliness, and fear. Sometimes letting go is the only way to take that leap forward and fulfill your full potential.\n\nA Final Note on How to Improve Your Life\n\nTaking an honest look at your value system is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself and others. Learning to love yourself and take the best action is never an easy lesson. But to really improve your life, it's necessary to ensure you're nurturing that part of yourself that helps you to positively impact the world.\n\nWishing you the best,\n Suzie Carr, Novelist\n\nP.S. Let's open this up to an honest discussion... Do you agree or disagree with any of these points?

Each release will cover a different reference or informational subject, and they will dovetail into some of the upcoming video projects that we have on the way.\nThe first two installments in the series are the Magpul Dynamics Precision Rifle Data Book, version 2.0, and the Magpul Dynamics Precision Rifle Quick Reference Cards. Most of the books in this series, as with these two, will be printed on a rugged, weatherproof, semi-rigid material that can be used with map pens, pencils, non-permanent markers, or grease pencils, and can be erased with an alcohol pen or any alcohol based liquid, and then re-used, but remain waterproof until intentionally erased.\nThe Data Book is based on dividing firing data into bands of density altitude. The cards are filled out by the user based on your preferred ballistic solver calculations for a centroid altitude for each band, the data is verified on the range, and then in use, you can simply refer to the color-coded density altitude chart to see which color card and data that you need to use. The Data Book includes pages for cold bore or night optic tracking logs, known distance, unknown distance with field sketches, moving targets, point of impact shift with suppressors or ammunition changes, and general note pages.\nThe Quick Reference cards are sized perfectly to fit in sleeve pouches or most commander or quarterback armboard mounts, and are based on the same density altitude color code system. The firing solutions from the data book are simply copied onto the QR cards, which are then easily referenced in the field. The QR cards also contain useful information like Mil ranging cards, wind estimation, firing checklists, observer dialogue, reticle holds, and note cards.\nBoth the data book and QR cards can be secured with aviator checklist rings, 550 cord, zip ties, or binder rings through pre-punched holes according to the user\u2019s preference.

In the prologue Duchamp appears on a reddish cosmos background, in a double-reflection version, male and female (let us recall Duchamps female identity, Rose S\u00e9lavy created in New York in 1920, with which the artist signed various works). But death comes to kidnap the superior part of our double hero, and lets the other one drop down towards the earth. Just like in the Platonic myth, the Convito, the unity of the androgynous is broken and the fallen Marcel (or Rose) will have to complete ten different tasks inside a museum before he/she will be able to reunite with his/her other half and renew the universe in a cosmic conflagration. Inside the museum, the paintings and the sculpture (there is only one  Michelangelos David) our hero/heroine meets on his way come to life and threaten him/her.\nWhat if the destiny, not only of art, but of all of Western culture, had been decided between 726 and 787 A.D., i.e., between the destruction of sacred images ordered by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III Isaurico and the following council of Nicea, which, on the contrary, declared the lawfulness of their cult?\nImages continue to have a central role  even after the decline of the Christian religion as a crucial means of social cohesion  in the secularised and disenchanted society which has formed in the course of modernity. The victory of iconolatry between the VIII and IX Century of the vulgar era, in other words, could have marked the West in an irreversible way.\nThe only way to really come to terms with the art of our past is by freeing it from the ideological and habitual incrustations, which have transformed some masterpieces into common places of a diffuse and banal culture.\nConcept and Design: Lorenzo Pizzanelli\nDirectors: Fariba Ferdosi and Lorenzo Pizzanelli", "title": "Iconoclast Game ENG 08 TOURISTS INVASION - BONUS 2", "publishedDate": "2009-07-13T23:47:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOFZskFxPWA", "description": "Zebra Finches Eating", "title": "Zebra Finches Eating", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T19:05:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOFrIV_z0jo", "description": "ni-resist - \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 live\nSpellbound Fest Winter Attack FINAL in Hleb 27.02.2011", "title": "ni-resist - \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 live in Hleb 27.02.2011", "publishedDate": "2011-03-07T14:35:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOFsfKP1458", "description": "http://bit.ly/1daiVuU \nBest mothers day quotes and mothers day quotes for cards and share.\nIn Honor of Mother's Day, I searched the web and selected the 11 best quotes about mothers. Psychological attachment theories suggest that the child's relationship with the parents forms the basis for adult relationships. The majority of children form secure attachments which allow them to use the parent as a safe haven from which to go out and explore the world. This results in adult attachment styles characterized by trust that others will be responsive to one's needs for nurturance, and trust in the self to safely negotiate relationships and challenges. If the attachment bond is disrupted by parental abandonment, abuse, inconsistent attachment or neglect, individuals may develop avoidant, anxious, or ambivalent attachment, characterized by a lack of consistent trust in self to function independently and/or in others to freely love and care for us. The attributes of a loving mother we see in the video should result in a securely attached adult.\n**********************************\nSubscribe our Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/coachingandgrowth\n\nNext Video:\nhttp://youtu.be/BOFsfKP1458\n\nShare the Video:\nhttp://youtu.be/U35vKt_0oXk\n**************************\n\n\nRecomended Spanish Video:\nFrases para el d\u00eda de la Madre:\nhttp://youtu.be/lDs4xNTop7M\n\n********************\nMore Related Videos\n\nfunny mothers day quotes\nunny mothers day quotes \nmothers day quote \nhappy mother day quotes \nmother day quote \nmothers day quotes \nbest mothers day quotes \nmothers day quotes for cards \nshort mothers day quotes \nmothers day sayings and quotes \nmother days quotes \nmother day quotes from daughter \nmothers days quotes \nmother s day quotes \nfunny mother day quotes \nmothers day quotes from kids \nmothers day quotes sayings \nmothers day quotes from the bible \nmothers day quotes from son \nmother s day quote \nhappy mother s day quotes \nmother day quotes from son \nfamous mothers day quotes \nmothers day quotes in spanish \ncute mothers day quotes \nquotes for mothers day \nmother day quotes in hindi \nmothers day quotes and sayings \ninspirational mothers day quotes \nreligious mothers day quotes \nfunny happy mothers day quotes \nspanish mothers day quotes \nfunny mothers day quotes from daughter \nchristian mothers day quotes \nmothers day cards \nmothers day poems \nmothers day \nmothers day quotes funny \nmother day cards \nhumorous mothers day quotes \nmothers day card \nmother day \nmothers day funny quotes \nfree mothers day quotes \nmother day poems \nmothers day ideas \nquotes about mothers day \nfunny mother s day quotes \nmothers day poem \nmothers day quotes cards \nquotes on mothers day \nmothers day greetings quotes \neasy mothers day cards \ngood happy mothers day quotes \nhumorous mothers day quotes \nmothers day cards kids \nmothers day plants \nsms for mother day \nuplifting quotes of the day \ngift mothers day \nmothers day printables \nmothers day london \nhappy mother day tagalog quotes\nhappy mother day tumblr quotes\nhappy mother day 2014 quotes\nhappy mother day sister quotes\nhappy mother day quotes in spanish\nhappy mothers day quotes from daughter\nhappy mother day poems", "title": "Best Mothers Day Quotes - Mothers Day Quotes for Cards", "publishedDate": "2014-04-21T20:24:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOFt2E9LflY", "description": "", "title": "caloosahatchee river 7 7 dink  5oz  trigger x aggression hodad", "publishedDate": "2012-12-20T15:05:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOFzN2J9DVU", "description": "Genuine original old 32 Ford barnfind first run out after some engine tinkering!.

It affects about 40% of people at some point in their lives. Low back pain (often abbreviated as LBP) may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain.\n\nIn most episodes of low back pain, a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by \"red flags\" such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events.\n\nThe treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain is typically with conservative measures such as the use of simple pain medications and the continuation of as much normal activity as the pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful, with acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) as the preferred first medication. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.\n\nA number of other options are available for those who do not improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability. It may also be useful for those with spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling and/or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain", "title": "Low back pain and sciatica, exercises to relieve back pain  /  Physiotherapy at home", "publishedDate": "2013-09-25T18:32:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOZX4E_54uM", "description": "FLETC's Sandy Peavy on Progress Made on IT Program-CIO Roundtable Federal Executive Forum-Live at The AFCEA 2013 Homeland Security Conference-March 2013", "title": "FEF-CIO Roundtable-Progress on Programs-FLETC-March 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-03-02T12:54:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOZXb9ITNUE", "description": "Ng\u00f4 Quang S\u01a1n\nHP: 0908 094 005\n------------------------------\nC\u00f4ng ty TNHH Hoa \u00dd\n\u0110\u1ecba ch\u1ec9: 406/63 C\u1ed9ng H\u00f2a, Ph\u01b0\u1eddng 13, qu\u1eadn T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh, TP.HCM\nTel: 08 3812 3931\nFax: 08 3812 3085\nEmail: son.hoay@gmail.com; hoa_y@hcm.vnn.vn", "title": "Metrohm UV Detection", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T05:50:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOZklOnAu5Q", "description": "This moth was eating holes in my clothes and I finally found it.

If you spend any significant amount of time walking around on the streets you (somewhat sadly) tend to become inured to all of the solicitations and I was on autopilot and kind of brushed this guy off when the light changed and I could be on my way to wherever I was going.\n\nSo many questions I could have asked him.  If they're two for a dollar, could I buy one for 50 cents?  If I wanted more than two could you hook me up with your supplier?  Have you been doing this often?  How did you set the price?  How do I know these are not stolen or counterfeit?  Etc.\n\nSome background information on this video:\n\nSomeone (not me) posted this on reddit, and I enjoyed reading all of the comments over there, even including the inevitable snarky ones.  Thought I'd add some clarifications here:\n\nI don't walk around constantly recording myself, but when carrying a mobile device capable of recording, sometimes I just let it record what's around me because, well, I can, and it doesn't cost anything, and you never know what you might run across (this video being an example).  The vast majority of the recordings go straight into the trash.\n\nThis video was not staged in any way.  I did not go get a camera and come back.  Believe me, if it had been staged the video and audio quality would be better.  It was just serendipity that I happened to be randomly recording when this guy approached me.  As I said above I was kind of on \"autopilot\" at the time.  Regrettably, I didn't even manage to capture the seller very well on the video.  It wasn't until sometime later that I said to myself, wait, did that really just happen?\n\nIndeed the video is shaky, since I was just randomly carrying the device.  This video was actually stabilized using software, it was much worse before.  But the software can't do much about the \"jello effect\" caused by a camera swinging around a lot.  Normally I have a professional crew with a steadicam following me around, but they were off that day.  ;)\n\nAnd, yes, I milked this moment, a time-honored comedic technique.  Now you can go back to the videos that are concise and of great social import, as of course 99% of all YouTube videos are.  ;)", "title": "Hot new commodity selling in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco", "publishedDate": "2013-01-27T23:24:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOdNqgX_Ufw", "description": "Plays For Lovers, 1985.

It's like getting on a train. And you got three stops to make. So your ticket has three parts. When you start out, you are given a ticket. The ticket has three parts. So while you are in the womb of your mother with no consciousness at all, this is one part of your trip. And when you are born, you enter the world, so one part of your ticket is torn off and thrown away! You will never get that ticket again. No refunds! That ticket is gone! That part of the journey is over! You will not go back to womb! It's a one-way trip! One ticket, one part of the ticket, GONE! Then you are in the life, from a child till you are an adolescent, teenager, young adult, mature adult, middle age, others among you more than that...until we meet the grave! Death and the grave! So when you die, the moment that you die and all of you will die, another part of the trip is over! And that part of the ticket is torn off and it's gone! You will not return back to this life! \n\nAt the moment of death, you'll see Malak ul-Maut (the angel of death). And you will be like, 'Oh my God! Who is this coming to me? Who is this? Somebody stop this one! Wait a minute! You guys can't hear me anymore! Hello! Hello! Hello!' But now your hands aren't moving and he is coming! Coming! Nothing you can do! And when he takes the ruh (soul) from the body the soul coming out, for the one who was evil it is so excruciating, it's the worst imaginable pain in the world! The pain of being born is remembered by the mother! The pain of dying is remembered by the son! Now what will you do? But for the one, for the one who was good, the one who obeyed Allah, believed in Allah, did 'amalussaalihaat (good deeds) - for him it will be easy! No more than just like you get stuck with a pin. Easy! \n\nSo these are two totally different ways to end your life. There are many different ways to live your life, you can live your life however you want! To each is own as they say! Eat, drink and be merry! Enjoy it while you got it! You only live once! No! No! No! You only die once! You live forever! You die only once! So, you can live your life however way you want, but you will die in one of two ways! And that decision is all in your hands. You can't blame anyone for that - except for yourselves!", "title": "The Third Ticket \u1d34\u1d30 \u2507 Powerful Islamic Reminder \u2507 TDR Production \u2507", "publishedDate": "2014-03-20T16:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BOj0qEs9xhY", "description": "Check out more on this horrifically heavy-handed horror host at ShlockMeister.com\n\nJoin in the cringe-watching with episodes of \"The Shlock Meister Show\" here on Youtube!", "title": "Introducing...

Also, the fact that doing this legit would take over an entire year on non-stop playing. As for me not 'having a life', Minecraft is a hobby of mine. I want to make minecraft videos for a living, so I need to put my time and effort into it. I already have a fulltime job, and go to college.

You don't want a fire storm. (video of fire ). It's a damage limitation exercise.  You don't want the customer on every social network having a go at your company. And you certainly don't want her speaking  to the press. And most of all you don't want her sending round her friends.\n\nIt is often best to choose a member of staff who has enough authority to act who can take these kind of calls. Someone who can take remedial action if need be. So if you are the person who gets the call to begin with  you might like to ask if you can transfer the call to someone with more authority.\n\nSo if you are that person with the authority then this is what you should do. \n\nFirst off take the call, (dbh pick up phone)  no matter how tempting it is to be engaged it would simply make matters worse. There is no time to prepare for these calls so your performance is a live one.\n\nEven if you know about the situation, it's best to act as if this is the first you've heard of it. \n\nThe best response is simply to allow the customer to vent their spleen and as the anger hopefully diminishes\ntry to understand what has made the her so angry\n\nDon't apologise for someone else\u2014that will allow the anger to be shifted to you.\n\nAnd don't offer a defense. That will only turn the conversation into a debate. \n\nInstead, show personal concern, express your regrets over the whole situation and then if possible offer to make amends or resolve the issue. \n\nWhatever happens don't grovel. You may find it useful to write down the main points of what is being said. This shows concern and also allows you to refer back to the conversation. If you have a quality control system you will need to record the call as a complaint.\n\nIn most cases, all the customer needed to do was to express her anger. But what if the customers tirade turns into a string of obscenities, foul language and personal remarks? \n\nThen you should remain calm (graphic of calm) --the customer is trying to get a reaction and if you get upset she's won. Ask her to moderate her language and say if she does not that you will have to terminate the call. Then if need be do cut the call.\n\nTry and regard the whole experience as a learning one for you -- not as a personal slight. You don't want to get drawn in and you don't want your blood pressure to be raised.\n\nBy accepting the customers anger, without accepting blame you should be able to resolve the situation as painlessly as possible.\n\nIf you have promised to do something to resolve the situation then you should follow up with another phone call and make sure it did resolve the situation -- if it didn't then the situation is defused by that call. If it did resolve it you may have made a friend.\n\nSo\n\nBe concerned and regretful\u2014not  defensive or apologetic\n\nListen, show you care, offer to do what you can, and leave it at that\n\nJudge your success by how much the damage has been contained.\n\n\nIf we can help further please contact us- we are real friendly people you can talk to.\nBirchills Telecom has been providing the simplest and most powerful business VoIP phone systems since 2009.

Unfortunately the businessman had a problem. His boss told him he had to give a presentation to a roomful of very important people who were coming from all over the world.  His boss said, \"Make sure your slides are interesting. Because afterwards we going to publish the presentation on our website so everyone can see it\".\nBut a lot of the content was very technical. For example the businessman had to talk about \"marketing\", \"supply\", \"profits\" and that sort of thing. Plus he had to explain concepts like \"cloud computing infrastructure\" and the \"intercloud\" which was a bit tricky.  And then he had to deliver a lot of complex information involving macro economic forecasting about the economies of Europe, China and the United States and future trends in international trade and cross border exchanges.\nThe businessman worked hard on his presentation. He even worked at home late into the night and at weekends.  Unfortunately, all this extra work and stress meant his wife wasn't very happy with him, nor were his children (who wanted him to play in the garden). Even the dog wasn't happy because she wanted the businessman to take her for a walk.  But even though he worked really hard, and got really stressed, the slides just didn't seem to be getting any more interesting.\nThen the businessman found out about a video production company based near London in UK called Kersh Media that created really cool animated cartoon presentations. Instead of boring, static slides; the company would produce cartoon animations which he could insert into his PowerPoint presentation to liven it up.\nNot only that; the company would also produce a video version of the presentation which could be put on the company's website afterwards.\nThe businessman got in touch and the company started working on it straight away. They helped him with some ideas for his script to make it more visual. Then they created some artwork and showed him a storyboard.. the businessman liked what he saw! When the businessman had approved the storyboard, they came to his office to record him reading it. They even offered to provide a professional actor to read it for him, but the businessman preferred to read it himself - which was fine.\nThe presentation was a great success. The animations brought everything to life, helped participants engage and encouraged discussion. One person said it was the most memorable presentation he'd ever seen. And new audiences enjoyed watching the video on the company's website and on the company's YouTube channel. The animations and visual metaphors crossed language barriers and prompted further discussion. In fact it became a bit of an online sensation.. went viral and turned up in some very unusual places.  All of this made the businessman very happy.  And because the businessman wasn't stressed anymore, it made his wife and family happy too. Even the dog was happy!  \nAnother happy ending from Kersh Media.

Fein, Gene Roddenberry, Jon Povill\nScreenwriter: Alan Dean Foster, Harold Livingston, Gene Roddenberry\nFilm Description: When plans to launch a second Star Trek television series in the late 1970s were scrapped by Paramount Pictures, the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry, instead transformed the aborted program's 2-hour pilot into this big budget theatrical feature. Five years after the legendary voyages of the starship Enterprise, James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is an unhappy, desk-bound admiral at Starfleet headquarters. Kirk goes aboard his old vessel to observe its re-launch under new captain Will Decker (Stephen Collins). Soon, however, an escalating crisis causes Kirk to take command of his old ship. A mysterious, planet-sized energy force of enormous power is headed for Earth. Reunited with Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and the rest of his former colleagues, Kirk takes the Enterprise inside the massive energy cloud and discovers that it is the long-lost NASA space probe Voyager. Now a sentient being after accumulating centuries of knowledge in its deep space travels, the alien, which calls itself V'ger, has come home seeking its creator. Although not a critical home run, box office receipts for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) were strong enough to inspire a revamped television series and a long-running line of theatrical sequels.\n\n\"star trek the motion picture\",\"william shatner\",\"leonard nimoy\",\"deforest kelley\",\"george takei\",\"james doohan\",\"nichelle nichols\",\"robert wise\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"alien sci-fi\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"gene roddenberry\",\"david c fein\",\"jon povill\",\"success videos\",\"spaceship videos\",\"admiral james t kirk\",\"mr spock\",\"dr leonard bones mccoy\",\"lt cmdr uhura\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++46515,/m/03hzfdp,/m/0k464,/m/0f13b,/m/084m3,/m/01_rh4,/m/012gl8", "title": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture (9/9) Movie CLIP - Thattaway (1979) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-27T19:54:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPNbBx6U_MI", "description": "Watch Peyton Manning's postgame interview after breaking the TD record", "title": "Watch Peyton Manning's postgame interview after br", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T17:56:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPNmc71b7iE", "description": "New IAMX Video directed by Hans Hmmers Jr.\nfilmed on location in Berlin.", "title": "IAMX - Spit it out", "publishedDate": "2006-11-06T09:27:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPNpJaq3cCI", "description": "Dublin Tree services Company | Abatis Dublin Tree Services | Stump removal. call Paddy on 087 251 9969 for free Quote. http://www.abatisdublintreeservices.com\nIn our last job of the year we were working out in Glasnevin Cemetery Dublin.

I take a few shots with each blank pistol and record the video results using both HD and slow motion cameras.\n\nOne nice point with the .22 caliber blank shooters is the lower cost to shoot them, .22 caliber crimped blanks work out to be much cheaper than the 9mm P.A.K. or .380 crimped blanks. Sure they are a bit quieter but louder than you may think, especially when coming out of a short barrel. Another selling point is how compact both of these guns really are which makes them easy to pack around if you want to take one with you on a hike or outing as a deterrent for any wildlife that may get a bit too close to you. The RG-300 and RG 3 are two very nice additions to the ROHM blank guns we sell in the Canada Replica Airguns Store.\n\nLink to my Table Top Review Video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4MalBANMhA\n\nBuy the ROHM RG-300 and RG 3 Blank Pistol in Canada:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/buy-air-blank-guns/#!/~/category/id=3179661&offset=0&sort=normal\n\nBuy Blank pistols in the US:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/buy-air-blank-guns-us/#!/~/category/id=2215361&offset=0&sort=normal\n\nCheck out the written review of these ROHM Blank Pistols on my website at:\nhttp://www.replicaairguns.com/posts/2013/4/5/rohm-rohm-rg-300-and-rg-3-22-caliber-blank-pistol-full-revie.html", "title": "ROHM RG-300 and RG 3 .22 Caliber Blank Pistol Field Test Shooting Review", "publishedDate": "2013-04-05T22:56:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPWPpKx4URI", "description": "all done in 1 day at Sharon Heights Country Club. 2 the T Media followed Patrick Mount around for the day & captured some awesome footage..", "title": "Mounter Having Fun at Sharon Heights - Trick Golf Shots 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-06-22T05:06:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPWkcbG6Ddg", "description": "Tour the Watagan State Forest with the Trakkadu AT & the Trakka Jabiru 4 x 4", "title": "Trakkadu AT Jabiru 4 x 4 Watagan", "publishedDate": "2013-06-03T12:37:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPWsa2fPTdg", "description": "Moments in American History.\nMercantilism in the 1700s meant we traded only with the Mother Country.

Iconic vocalist/guitarist Michael Sweet of Stryper and legendary guitarist George Lynch of Lynch Mob/Dokken have teamed up to form a new supergroup Sweet & Lynch. Joining them on this new musical adventure is bassist James Lomenzo and drummer Brian Tichy. The band will be releasing their debut album Only To Rise on January 23rd 2015 in Europe and January 27th, 2015 in North America via Frontiers Music Srl. Sweet & Lynch recently launched a pre-order for the new album via PledgeMusic. The pre-order features various bundle packages for fans and is live at:\nhttp://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/sweetlynch\n\n\"When I was approached to help put together an all-star lineup, instantly I thought of George Lynch,\u201d explains Michael Sweet. \u201cGeorge is one of the most talented guitarists out there and a \u2018bucket list\u2019 player for me. George wrote riffs/basic ideas and I wrote melodies, lyrics and arranged and completed the songs. I knew that we would compliment each other's style. When you add the amazing rhythm section of Brian Tichy and James Lomenzo, you just can't go wrong with this line-up. It really is a special project and I'm honored to be a part of it!\"\n\nFrom the opening notes of \u201cThe Wish\u201d to the drum solo finish on the album-closer \u201cOnly To Rise,\u201d it is evident that this musical partnership between Michael Sweet\u2019s unmistakable voice and George Lynch\u2019s signature guitar tone has yielded incredible results. Songs \u201cDying Rose,\u201d \u201cMe Without You\u201d and \u201cStrength In Numbers\u201d showcase the diversity that permeates throughout the entire album. Sweet & Lynch released a lyric video for the 9/11 inspired track \u201cSeptember\u201d which can be seen here: http://youtu.be/i5G5uzrYWXw. An EPK featuring Michael and George discussing this new project can be seen here: http://youtu.be/BPYIoe0fTqI. Only To Rise was produced by Michael Sweet who also produced the last Stryper album, No More Hell To Pay, which received massive fan praise and critical acclaim alike.\n\nThe track listing for Only To Rise is:    \n\n1) The Wise    \n2) Dying Rose\n3) Love Stays\n4) Time Will Tell\n5) Rescue Me\n6) Me Without You\n7) Recover\n8) Divine\n9) September\n10) Strength In Numbers\n11) Hero-Zero\n12) Only To Rise\n\nPlans are currently being worked out for Sweet & Lynch to play a few live shows in the Spring of next year, making this different than any other supergroups that record together but never play live. More information will be announced in the near future. If the past records of these four musicians are any indication, no fan will want to miss these shows. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SweetLynch\nhttp://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/sweetlynch\nhttp://www.frontiers.it", "title": "Sweet & Lynch EPK (Official / Studio Album 2014 / G.

An interrogation is custodial if you are under arrest at the time it is made. \n So, if you are subjected to a custodial interrogation without first being read your Miranda Rights, then anything you say subsequent to that time must be excluded from the jury&rsquo;s or judge&rsquo;s consideration. As a result, this can be a very important tool in preventing the state from proving that you are guilty. \n If you are being charged and need representation, you can reach Mr. Speaks for a free consultation at 877.593.4233.  http://www.speakslaw.com/practice_areas/north-carolina-criminal-defense-attorney-the-speaks-law-firm.cfm", "title": "Miranda Rights and What Is Admissible in Court", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T06:37:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPaj9rnqaOM", "description": "Sen.

I am a professional table tennis player who has been competing internationally since 1995. I am here today to speak to you about the intermediate and beginner aspects of the Olympic sport of table tennis. Okay I'm gonna demonstrate the forehand smash. What's really really important in not only the forehand smash but everything in table tennis is to be able to pass through the ball, especially on the forehand. You need to get the racket to pass through the ball quickly. Okay and the way we do this, it depends on the ball that we get. Now, if somebody's giving us a normal ball we're gonna start here, we're gonna get our shoulder back a little bit, and we're just gonna try to smash through the ball, just like this. Now, if somebody gives us an under spin ball we're gonna smash, but our racket face is gonna be open a little so we can hit the bottom of the ball. And if somebody gives us a top-spin ball we're gonna smash on top of the ball. But the main key with the forehand smash is to be able to get the racket to pass through the ball. You start with your right leg behind you, you have your shoulder back a little bit, and you transfer your weight from left to right. Transfer. The forehand stroke is a very important stroke in table tennis, and we use the forehand smash to, usually, win the point. So we, we try to smash through the ball, the ball travels very fast. And the forehand smash was very effective in the 1970's and the 1980's. It's still very effective today, but the forehand smash is mainly used in order to finish the point, to try to win the point.", "title": "How to Do a Table Tennis Forehand Smash | Ping Pong", "publishedDate": "2011-06-21T18:19:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPqHYWfUcaE", "description": "School science - people science -science show \n& innovator mihir kumar panda\n\nThe career of a science activist like Mihir panda begun to find out the practicability of mathematics and science in real life. In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\nSchool science & people science\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "optical illusion", "publishedDate": "2011-05-08T11:45:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPqRdS1KqhI", "description": "", "title": "2 Tipuana Lodge", "publishedDate": "2014-09-10T08:51:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "BPqZ5XH0B8M", "description": "Looking for broadcast footage?

Acanthophis genus in general uses caudal luring very often for hunting.\n\nThe second part of the video is the unusual part. I was trying to remove my yearling female Acanthophis hawkei and she went into feeding mode immediately. When she saw movement, she attacked and bit the little cactus plant, which is planted in the cage.

You're not the type of people to bang pots and pans on the streets.\"\n\n'Tayyip resign'\n\nIstanbul Municipality, ruled by Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP), extended the metro hours until 4am (local time) to allow his supporters to commute to and from the airport more easily.\n\nAl Jazeera's Anita McNaught, reporting from Ankara, said party activists have been communicating via text messages and had told supporters to stay at home and to remain calm.\n\nShe said that even though the deputy prime minister had requested them not to go to the airport to receive Erdogan, McNaught was told that activists received text messages saying that a bus would be present to collect them.\n\n\"A growing polarisation is building among the two sides,\" McNaught said.\n\nEarlier, tens of thousands of angry anti-government protesters again packed cities across the country chanting \"Tayyip resign\", others singing and dancing. In Ankara's Kugulu Park, thousands chanted anti-government slogans, sang the national anthem and swigged on beer.\n\nThe nationwide unrest, fuelled by anger against what protesters see as Erdogan's growing authoritarianism, claimed a third life with the death of a policeman, media said.\n\nErdogan has so far responded with defiance to the biggest challenge of his decade-long rule, and further enraged protesters on Thursday by pledging to press ahead with the redevelopment of Istanbul's Gezi Park, whose conservation fight sparked the protests.\n\nSpeaking in Tunis ahead of his return, Erdogan reiterated his claims that extremists and foreign agitators were to blame for the violence.\n\n\"Among the protesters, there are extremists, some of them implicated in terrorism,\" including some who were in Taksim Square where the trouble broke out last week, he told reporters.\n\n'Fate of this resistance'\n\nPolice backed by armoured vehicles and helicopters have clashed with groups of protesters night after night, leaving three dead and about 4,000 injured, while thousands of Erdogan's opponents have massed peacefully in Taksim, surrounded by barricades of torn-up paving stones and street signs.\n\n\"It's all up to Erdogan and what he says right now. He will decide the fate of this resistance, whether it will calm [down] or escalate,\" said Mehmet Polat, 42, a ship captain who has not worked all week, coming instead to protest at Taksim.\n\n\"These people have been here for days, he has to understand it is for a reason,\" he said.\n\nThe protesters are of a variety of political stripes, including far leftists, nationalists, environmentalists and secular Turks, and their numbers at Taksim have increased at points to more than an estimated 100,000. \n\nBut despite the unrest, Erdogan remains by far Turkey's most popular politician, his assertive style and common touch resonating with the conservative Islamic heartland.\n\nHis AK Party has won an increasing share of the vote in three successive elections and holds around two thirds of the seats in parliament. A man who rarely bows to any opposition, he clearly has no intention of stepping down and there are no obvious rivals inside or outside his party.\n\nStill, he faces a challenge in calming the protests without appearing to lose face.\n\nTurkey Riots Photos:\nhttp://aljazeera.smartgalleries.net/gallery/1370530418810?image_id=01ndcx2coVei4", "title": "Turkey PM calls for end to protests", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T16:00:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ-wB24OZiQ", "description": "It has been a time of unimaginable sadness for Robin Williams? family.\nIt has been a time of unimaginable sadness for Robin Williams? family.\nIt has been a time of unimaginable sadness for Robin Williams? family.\n'We're working hard on acclimatising to new normal': Robin Williams' son Zak speaks for first time about how family are coping his father's death\n'We're working hard on acclimatising to new normal': Robin Williams' son Zak speaks for first time about how family are coping his father's death\n'We're working hard on acclimatising to new normal': Robin Williams' son Zak speaks for first time about how family are coping his father's death", "title": "'We're working hard on acclimatising to new normal': Robin Williams' son Zak speaks for first time", "publishedDate": "2014-11-21T16:07:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ0fhkNcZqA", "description": "Wow :////", "title": "Am I lagging?", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T23:25:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ0teGZD4pg", "description": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue Assassin Hunter Gameplay Trailer.", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue Assassin Hunter Gameplay Trailer", "publishedDate": "2014-09-05T13:23:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ13A7UERxs", "description": "Preview for infomatrix 2012.", "title": "Wonderland: New Beginnings (infomatrix 2012)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-09T22:02:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ13dkVq2lE", "description": "pessoal......\u00e9 muito simples...mas n\u00e3o fa\u00e7o para venda.\naqui ele j\u00e1 montado na guitarra. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqlqt8ZAdc\nA quem interessar, me pede o esquema pelo meu face.", "title": "Sustainer Infinito de Guingo Mendes - DIY Handmade", "publishedDate": "2014-01-14T11:01:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ17w_qC_5Q", "description": "Shows how to decorate an elegant and charming French provincial bedroom. 5/17.

Coyote (also known simply as \"The Coyote\") and The Road Runner are a duo of characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. In the cartoons, Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Coyote, instead of a coyote's animal instincts, uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans to pursue his prey, which always comically backfire.\n\nThe characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like Tom and Jerry, but became popular in its own right.\n\nThe Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), introducing himself as \"Wile E. Coyote \u2014 super genius\", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc.[1] The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, \"Beep, Beep\", recorded by Paul Julian, and an occasional \"popping-cork\" tongue noise.[2]\n\nTo date, 48 cartoons have been made featuring these characters (including the three CGI shorts), the majority by Chuck Jones.\n\nTV Guide included Wile E.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "living octopus in korea served for dinner", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T21:55:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ21p1EejdU", "description": "I do not own the rights to this video.\n\nTo see the entire seminar \"The stone speakers\" go to www.bashar.org", "title": "Bashar - Ganesh, Jesus & God", "publishedDate": "2014-07-19T23:44:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQ223xGCFNw", "description": "This is for my cognitive psychology class.

Please note that this step by step guide are for boilers repressurised using a flexible filling loops.\n\nStep 1 -- Check the pressure on your boiler. If the gauge is below 1 bar then you will need to top the system up using your flexible filling loop.\n\nStep 2- Locate your filling loop. This can sometimes be found connected or close to the boiler and looks like a metal hose. One end should be connected to the cold water feed with the other end needing to be connected to the system.\n\nStep 3 - There may be a cap on the end of the valves remove the cap either with a spanner or with your fingers if you are able to do so.\n\nStep 4 --  Connect the flexible hose to valves and make sure the filling loop is connected and tightened by hand to allow the repressurising to begin.\n\nStep 5 - To fill the system, locate the taps to open the filling loop.  These will vary depending on the manufacture. When the tap is opened this will introduce cold water into the system and the gauge will start to rise (quarter turn). Some filling loops have a screw driving slot, in which case you will need to turn the valve open a quarter turn until you hear the water entering the system.

The uncontrollable compulsion to eat a large quantity of food very quickly is known as a binge. Many bulimia sufferers report that they are 'out of control' during the binge period. They simply can't stop eating through will power and will only stop when they run out of food or physically can't eat any more.\n\nThe binge has essentially been the subconscious (survival) part of the brain taking over and using compulsion to force the sufferer to eat a large quantity of food very quickly. The reason for this is that the survival part of the brain recognises the body is potentially starving and has taken decisive action by over-riding the bulimia sufferers will power. \n\nFollowing the binge the sufferer has a full stomach of food and the prospect of starvation has been averted. The subconscious part of the mind has done its survival job and can now stand down. However, the conscious part of the mind, full of the fear of potential weight gain (and the emotional trauma it could bring) kicks into action. Thoughts of weight gain and cruel, scathing comments via internal dialogue elicit crushing feelings of fear, shame and guilt. \n\nTo avoid potential weight gain the bulimia sufferer then takes conscious steps to purge the food which has been consumed. The most common purge technique is vomiting, although laxatives and diuretics as well as extreme exercise can also be used. Purging the consumed food promises to neutralise the fear of weight gain... so the bulimia sufferer vomits (or whatever). \n\nSome bulimia sufferers say that the purging process clears them of all the negative emotions they were dealing with following the binge. However, other bulimia sufferers say that although they feel a sense of relief that they hopefully wont gain weight from the binge... they also feel terrible shame and guilt for what they have done... yet again. This is when they say to themselves, \"never again\" or \"that was the last time\" - but of course that transpires not to be the case...\n\nIn our next video in the 'Symptoms Of Bulimia' series we'll discuss the shame and secrecy surrounding bulimia.

Because it draws toxins from the body with its astringent nature, plantain may be crushed (or chewed) and placed as a poultice directly over the site of bee stings, bug bites, acne, slivers, glass splinters, or rashes. Bandage the area and allow the plantain to work its magic for 4-12 hours. Plantain may also be used to create a balm for emergency kits, or an infusion used as a skin or general wash. It is also a notable, soothing remedy for hemorrhoids.\n\n\nPlantain is renowned for its healing effect on the digestive system. This is especially useful for anyone who has been damaged by antibiotics, anti-inflammatory or pain medications, food allergies, or Celiac disease. Both leaves and seeds specifically target the digestive system for healing.\nThe leaves may be steeped as tea, added to soups, or dried with a sauce similar to kale chips. The seeds -- a type of psyllium -- can be ground or soaked for bulk mucilage or absorbable fibre, which, consumed before meals, may help with weight loss.\n\nBecause plantain is a gentle expectorant and high in silica, an infusion can be helpful for lung problems, coughs, and colds.\n\nPlantain is almost a panacea for the human body, treating everything from all menstrual difficulties, all digestive issues, to nearly all skin complaints, and even arthritis.

But Romania ranks as the European Union's second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin. Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility.\n\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/technologyNews/~3/XMPNI6CJURQ/story01.htm\nhttp://www.wochit.com", "title": "Bitcoin Catches On In Tech-savvy Romania", "publishedDate": "2014-07-28T13:12:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQKAxXcxffk", "description": "Ecoterrorism video i made for SOC 101-06", "title": "ecoterrorism", "publishedDate": "2007-12-07T03:51:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "BQKZ2Y4binU", "description": "Laying a new power supply to house ready for loft conversion and proposed extension", "title": "2010-09-13.

It is high in antioxidants and this increases the productivity of carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes and also protects cell proteins, cell fats, and DNA.\n\nThere are many testimonials about this tea that indicate that it can help with cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure. Of course stress and lack of quality sleep may be worse for health than anything else. Research has shown that meditation can lower high blood pressure or hypertension.

Welcome to this segment of the wonderful question of what makes a great website? We're going to talk about that today, so keep watching! Alright, we're back here. I'm the author of the Ultimate Guide to Search Engine Optimization, it's in the bookstores now, and a founder of Small Business SEO tips. \n\nNow today, as I said, we have a big question. What makes a great website? And I've broken this down into four pillars essentially, of engagement, because, guess what? Today's day and age you need to engage with your audience and it starts with content. You've heard it before, right? Content is king, quality content. \n\nAnd what does that really mean, right? You hear about the search engines, keywords, phrases, optimizing. Well, you know what? You need to think about your audience first. What is it that they want? What do they engage with? What can you to the table, right? So, it's gotta be relevant, it's gotta be themed, it's gotta be fresh. And, yes, optimized. \n\nBut, you need to get the content right. Now, I have a little worksheet, a little sort of overview below this in a PDF. You can download it. That will get you started with some further tips. Second one here, which is critical, absolutely critical, is you need now to build a community, a social community. Social media is huge, right? \n\nAnd guess what? If you have great content, quality content, engaging content, the community will respond. Like videos like this, right? If you develop that out there, and that can be in many formats, from blogs, you know, text, audio, video, all of these things really allow them to grab and see you and engage back. \n\nIt is going to be huge and this actually has a viral component, and I'm sure you've seen that, right? second or third one rather is capture leads. All of this is for naught if you can't capture leads. And by the way, when you do these things, you create authority, trust, rapport, and by the time you get here and ask them for their name and e-mail, you can actually nurture that relationship. \n\nSend them more information. Send them tips, tricks, insights, news, updates, etc. through that. So you gotta capture your leads, that's essential. And the final one? Guess what it is, right? Well, we all wanna make money and so monetization strategies. You probably have sales programs, product services. \n\nMaybe you have a DVD home study course. Teleseminars, webinars, and I have a webinar that should show up in this video right about now. And you click it, it'll take you to a webinar where it will actually show you how I do these things, and I've done this online since mid-1995 now, a long time online. \n\nBut it's taken me actually a long time to learn as well, so I'm right there with you. But these four pillars are huge. But, guess what? They're nothing without this final one here. It starts with a T. And we're gonna break this down for you really quick, and it's this word, tracking. You've got to track it to see how it works. And to make sure that you actually have a component called Web Analytics in there. And that's really the essence for a successful website and what really makes a great website. \n\nSo, hoped you like this. I enjoyed making it for you. These are 4 pillars. Download the PDF. Make sure you sign up for the webinar, and I'll see you in a future segment. Jon out. Have a great day, evening or night. Almost forgot.

I always try to make myself the butt of the joke, and not the people I prank. This one didn't portray that as much as I would've liked.
