Kate Middleton, however, is no typical celebrity, and despite her rising princess status, the Duchess arrived to the Queen of England's Diamond Jubilee wearing last season's fashion.\n\nThe much-adored Duchess with a highly revered fashion sense arrived wearing a red Alexander McQueen dress from the 2011 collection, paired with a red flowered hat that Middleton has already worn at least twice before.\n\nMeanwhile, Queen Elizabeth appeared in a white and silver coat, which she paired with a Swarovski crystal trimmed hat. The outfit was the custom work of her in-Palace couturier, Angela Kelly.\n\nDespite the ongoing rain, the Queen managed to stand an impressive 4-and-a-half hours in honor of her guests.\n\n\"I think she thought a million and half people have come to the Thames to wave her on, cheer her on, she was not going to sit down,\" ABC News' royal correspondent Roya Nikkhah said. \"They were standing up. She stood 4.5 hours. Extraordinary stamina. That's why she's still going.

The paper is rolled, looped, curled, twisted and otherwise manipulated to create shapes which make up designs to decorate greetings cards, pictures, boxes, eggs, and to make models, jewellery, mobiles etc. The most popular and versatile technique is that of rolling. The paper strip is rolled in fingers or using a tool. The coil is then released and then glued at the tip and then shaped. These shaped coils are arranged to form flowers, leaves, and various ornamental patterns\n\nDuring the Renaissance, French and Italian nuns and monks used quilling to decorate book covers and religious items. The paper most commonly used was strips of paper trimmed from the gilded edges of books. These gilded paper strips were then rolled to create the quilled shapes. Quilling often imitated the original ironwork of the day.\n\nIn the 18th century, quilling became popular in Europe where gentle ladies of quality (\"ladies of leisure\") practiced the art. It was one of the few things ladies could do that was thought not too taxing for their minds or gentle dispositions. Quilling also spread to the Americas and there are a few examples from Colonial times.\n\nMany quilled art works can be found on cabinets and stands, cribbage boards, ladies' purses, a wide range of both pictures and frames, work baskets, tea caddies, coats of arms and wine coasters. Storage boxes, larger than most jewelry boxes with drawers and/or tops that opened, quilled lock boxes, and much more. Some items were specially designed for quilling with recessed surfaces. Quilling was also combined or married with other techniques such as embroidery and painting.\n\nThe craft has gone through many transformations and changes through the ages using new techniques, styles and materials. Dimensional quilling creates 3D items.\n\nToday, quilling is seeing a resurgence in popularity with quillers (people who practice the art of quilling) on every continent and in every walk of life. No longer confined to the \"upper classes\", this is a peoples art form and the beauty of the art is always expanding. The craft has become increasingly popular due to the low cost of the material. It is used to decorate wedding invitations, for Christmas, birth announcements, greeting cards, scrapbook pages, and boxes. Quilling can be found in art galleries in Europe and in the United States and is an art that is practiced around the world.", "title": "How to make Beautiful Paper \"Earing\" quilling video #QuillingArtDesign", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T03:36:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "--Hd6vKz0v0", "description": "Periorbital dark circles (also dark circles or raccoon attack) are dark blemishes around the eyes.

Russian television broadcasted a pre-taped version of the Games' symbol from rehearsals, which millions of people in Russia saw. The apparent failure meant the ring could not be illuminated by fireworks as had happened during rehearsals. Five giant snowflake-shaped structures suspended from the roof of the Fisht Stadium on the shores of the Black Sea in Sochi were supposed to open into circles and then light up with pyrotechnics. Only four opened, and that particular feature, near the very start of the 2-1/2-hour opening ceremony, was abandoned. Ceremony producer Konstantin Ernst was philosophical about the mishap. \"Among five rings, one of them didn't open. And you know, Zen Buddhists have an idea: if you have an ideally polished ball, you have to leave a scratch, to get an idea of how ideally it was polished,\" he said.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Small kids eating Sannakji A Korean Delicacy Of Living Octopus", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T17:38:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "--N4tQ8vcmI", "description": "", "title": "My grandchild Ivana.", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T20:15:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "--NAVpsJ-sQ", "description": "Pinoy beauty pageant fans have zeroed in on the Fil-Am North Dakota native who took first runner-up at last weekend's Miss USA pageant.

Moose are distinguished by the palmate antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic (\"twig-like\") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal and mixed deciduous forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Moose used to have a much wider range but hunting and other human activities greatly reduced it over the years. Moose have been re-introduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most Moose are found in Canada, Alaska, Scandinavia and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are wolves, bears, and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move surprisingly fast if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn can lead to spectacular fights between males competing for the right to mate with a particular female.", "title": "Moose sounds", "publishedDate": "2012-12-18T22:32:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "--QO2hz7FOE", "description": "Tony, who is the consummate imager, has a few comments on components of a telescope and their usage, while checking the collimation of Mike's SCT", "title": "Tony collimating an SCT", "publishedDate": "2013-10-05T15:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "--QXTVLiRDs", "description": "The Black Opera | produced by Tall Black Guy | \nfeaturing Georgia Anne Muldrow | Directed by Jay Brown\n\"The Great Year\" https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-great-year/id908877396\n\nCD http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/the-black-opera-the-great-year/MMG056CD/\n\nA Message from The Black Opera:\n\"What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.\n\nThe Black Opera enlist the Queen Georgia Anne Muldrow to reinforce the multilinear concept of the beginning and the end. This songs nuance stands for power, rebirth, triumph, completion, and exhaultation. It is TBO's audible Alpha and Omega.\"\n\nAbout the album:\nTrusted with a culture kept under the concrete, the warning has been spread for years. Many assumed their operations were limited to underground societies or secret networks. But, The Black Opera have been among us all along. The time to hide is behind them. There will be no riot; the revolution has already taken place. The Great Year has come.\n\nThe newest movement from The Black Opera is truth. After the telling of the three part epic, The Black Op: Era I, TBO has returned without allegory or allusion. The Great Year is a modern story of emergence and art- a resistance to assimilation. It is a story of triumph and camaraderie and a renaissance of new thinking. The new album's influences musically are as diverse as they are aesthetically. From tribal rhythms to overdriven synths and from pulsing drums to intimate vocals, The Great Year's sound is distinctly its own. Taking on a modern day palette, TBO has envisioned a new world, musically. With orchestration from creative minds like Tall Black Guy, Wajeed, yU and Arjun Singh, The Black Opera have assembled a team to help them communicate their message to the world.\n\nAcross the world, people put on the mask to reveal their faces. We are The Black Opera.\n\nSocial Media:\nThe Black Opera http://twitter.com/TheBlackOpera\nMello Music Group http://twitter.com/MelloMusicGroup\n\nhttp://www.theblackopera.com\nhttp://www.mellomusicgroup.com", "title": "The Black Opera - Beginning of the End (feat.

Need we say more?\n\nOwn Fast Five October 4th on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\nVin Diesel and Paul Walker lead a reunion of returning all-stars from every chapter of the explosive franchise built on speed in Fast Five. In this installment, former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) partners with ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) on the opposite side of the law. Dwayne Johnson joins returning favorites Jordana Brewster, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon and Don Omar for this ultimate high-stakes race.\n\nSince Brian and Mia Toretto (Brewster) broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail.\n\nHard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey...before someone else runs them down first.\n\n \nhttp://www.fastfivemovie.com", "title": "Fast Five - The Gurkha - Own it 10/4 on Blu-ray & DVD", "publishedDate": "2011-09-27T00:27:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "--UzSkmIVjE", "description": "Downloadble 3D model on this link: http://millergocg.com/?product=brembo-full-break-system-free\nSong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK2aIUmmdP4\nTutorial: Modelling - #1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB4vugpUoHw\nTutorial: Modelling - #2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MFiHOl0q10\nTutorial: Modelling - #3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cqzGa8z7f8\nTutorial: Modelling - #4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzqQFHtaf4c\nTutorial: Modelling - #5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Ii9wKzK9Y\nTutorial: Modelling - #6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEAKE6Vu_Sg\nTutorial: Modelling - #7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpGAVxhIbQU\nTutorial: Modelling - #8: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8cOhDjSX6E\nTutorial: Modelling - #9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HfJ9muqRA8\nTutorial: Modelling - #10: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly_5uBVQHzM\nTutorial: Modelling - #11: \n\nPortfolio: http://millergocg.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/millergoCG", "title": "PREVIEW - Brembo Caliper Brake Modelling Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2014-05-05T16:28:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "--V1MaWvR7I", "description": "beautiful natural color, various strains of phototropic bacteria", "title": "another yellowstone hotspring", "publishedDate": "2010-09-29T01:50:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "--VD0qUSlZM", "description": "", "title": "D-1 \u4e88\u9078\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9 Tall/H-MAN/Akihiro", "publishedDate": "2013-12-09T10:15:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "--VuGLttV7w", "description": "Kinetitype Animated Typeface:\nThis animated typeface is like having several all in one.  3 different animation settings, plus stroke, fill and color settings for lots of different possibilities of looks and styles.

Pimples may also crop up for genetic reasons. It is not clear how it can be inherited from one's parents, but studies do indicate a high occurrence of pimples in children whose parents had it,too.\nThe pimples associated with adolescence almost certainly occur because of hormonal changes that take place during puberty. Both males and females get an overdose of the male hormone testosterone during this period,causing excessive generation of sebaceous fluids that invariably cause pimples.\n\nGIVEN BELOW ARE A FEW SIMPLE HOME REMEDIES TO FIGHT PIMPLES.\n\n1.The most basic form of pimple prevention is hygiene and preventive skin care. Regular washing of the affected areas with mild soap is a must.The soap need not necessarily contain any chemicals designed to prevent pimples .However, face washing should not be overdone or the skin will become dehydrated .\n\n2.Care should be taken on makeup,moisturizers and other skin care products.If these products are oil based,it would just make the problem worse. Use water based products instead.\n\n3.Generally we rub, press or squeeze our pimples.Don't when we do this,we risk spreading the bacteria to other areas.\n\n4.Lemon juice diluted in water can be applied externally because of its antiseptic\nquality.\n\n5.Tea Tree oil can also be applied directly to infected pores.\n\n6.Vitamin A tablets are also a natural and effective cure. Vitamin A promotes healthy skin.\n\n7.Before bathing, apply a mixture of fresh tomato pulp, honey and rose-water to your face and keep for twenty minutes before washing off.\n\n8.Juice of raw papaya is the best treatment for pimples.Apply fresh juice of raw papaya on pimples and get a good result.\n\n9.Directly rub potato slices all over the face, helps to get rid of blemishes and\npimple scar.\n\n10.Drink plenty of water and vegetable or fruit juices.\n\n11.Use cucumber or other fruit and vegetable packs to cure pimple scars.\n\n12.Maintain a diet that is rich in cottage cheese, salads, fresh juices, fish and\nyogurt.These help to cleanse your system and ward off pimples.\n\n13.Another overnight home remedy for pimples is to put a dab of toothpaste on it to help dry it out. Calamine lotion also will have the same drying effect.\n\n14.Pound orange peel with water and apply to affected areas.\n\n15.Another useful remedy for pimples is zinc. Which can be taken in a dose of 50 mg daily for a month and then reduce the dose.\n\n16.You can clean your skin with apple cider vinegar as an overnight home pimple remedy.\n\n17.Aspirin contains Beta hydroxy acid which is a powerful defoliant ,so you can crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.\nhow to remove pimple marks,clear acne fast,how to get rid of chest acne,proactive reviews,how to reduce pimples,tea tree oil acne,how to remove pimples,how to prevent pimples,treatment for blackheads on back\nFinally,certain medications may temporarily alter the hormonal changes prevalent during adolescence and cause pimple outbreaks.

The alphabet is turned on its head and inside-out and the results culminate in a compilation of daring and surprising verbo-visual gems.\n\nThe Last Vispo Anthology is composed of vispo (a portmanteau of the words \"visual\" and \"poetry\") from the years 1998 to 2008, during a burst of creative activity fueled by file sharing and email, which made it possible for the vispo community to establish a more heightened and sophisticated dialogue with one another. The collection extends the dialectic between art and literature that began with ancient \"shaped text,\" medieval pattern poetry, and dada typography, pushing past the concrete poetics of the 1950s and the subsequent mail art movement of the 1980s to its current incarnation. Rather than settle into predictable, unchallenged patterns, this vibrant poetry seizes new tools to expand the body of work that inhabits the borderlands of visual art and poetic language.\n\nThe Last Vispo Anthology features 148 contributors from 23 countries on five continents. It includes 12 essays that illuminate the abundant history and the state of vispo today. The anthology offers a broad amalgam of long-time practitioners and poets new to visual poetry over the last decade, underscoring the longevity and the continued vitality of the art form.\n\nAdvance Praise:\n\n\"The descriptor 'visual poetry' cannot begin to hint at the wealth of potent mystery that The Last Vispo contains. It knocked my mind right off its cozy little track and sent it sprawling through a myriad of brand new experiences. I can't remember the last time I encountered something so charged, mysterious, deep and pleasurably upsetting as this book.\" -- Jim Woodring\n\n\"A delightful cornucopia of imaginary languagescapes, opening the eye to other alphabetic climes, beyond the ho-hum regimentation of linear normalcies. & all from (just about) the past decade. Visual poetries: alive and expanding. It's positively viral.\" -- Charles Bernstein\n\n\"Staring your way into and through the letter as object \u2014 the letter as solitary sign, the letter as crowned king. Staring gives us the keys to the kingdom. This book is a glorious adjunct to the long history of concrete and visual poetry.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "Lovely Flower Show....", "publishedDate": "2014-02-01T04:53:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-051q1fqGbE", "description": "Here is a little video we put together for you, gentle viewer.

Urine odor is a difficult problem to solve. Regular cleaners don't always remove all the urine from carpet or wood floors. When urine evaporates, it attaches to moisture in the air and dust particles to be spread throughout the house. On humid days, you can smell the urine again, for years.\n\nThe Air-ReNu product is a blend of 27 natural earth minerals that releases negatively charged ions. The odor molecules attract these ions and they cause the air pollutants to become heavier than air and they fall to the ground, removing the odor from the air.\n\nThis is the same process that a few companies use to clean the air. The difference is that most of the other products come in a gel form and have to be replaced every few weeks or months. Air-ReNu says that by mixing their product into paint and covering your walls or ceilings, it will release these negative ions for 10 to 12 years.\n\nI've used it in a couple projects so far and the homeowners have had positive reviews.

Above all, Hilliard created several powerful portraits of Queen Elizabeth herself. The \"Phoenix\" portrait reproduced here shows a confident woman in her early forties who looks straight ahead. By contrast, the locket of 1600, a year before she died, shows an idealised portrait with flowing golden hair, symbolic of her continuing vitality but also designed to mislead. Other royal sitters include Elizabeth's successor James VI and her rival Mary Queen of Scots, while a portrait of Henry VIII is copied from Holbein's celebrated study. Costumes indicate status and wealth, but Hilliard's images also convey personality. Among many unknown women is an elegant lady who may be Essex's sister, Lady Penelope Rich, celebrated in the poetry of Sir Philip Sidney. Hilliard's importance rests partly on a treatise about his working methods, covering both theory and practice and including some personal biography. Born into a Protestant family in 1547, he was sent abroad during the reign of Catholic Queen Mary and trained as a goldsmith on his return, probably learning techniques of painting at the same time.

The position is largely ceremonial because the Benedictines are a loose confederation, but there are different responsibilities involved.  \n\n\nNotker Wolf\nAbbot Primate, Order of Saint Benedict\nMy  real responsibility is to ensure union among the Benedictine orders and all of the confederations, and to be the chief representative of all of the orders, and to make sure the monasteries are collaborating.  For this I go to all of the national reunions of abbots or superiors just to be there and have discussions with them.   They also asked me to come because they said: you have the most experience on how it is done in other parts of the world.  \n\nThe order has somewhat of a special kinship with Benedict XVI, who took his papal name in part because of his admiration of Saint Benedict, the founder of the Order.   \n\nNotker Wolf\nAbbot Primate, Order of Saint Benedict\nThe Pope is from Bavaria, and as we say, Bavaria is a land that is benedetta, blessed and Benedictine.  There are many Benedictine monasteries, and Benedictines had a great influence on the Bavarian mentality.  So this is where he comes from. Every year for more than 20 years he has done a private retreat to a Benedictine monastery in Bavaria.\n\nThere are approximately 25,000 Benedictine monks and nuns around the world, with strong presences in the United States, Western Europe, India, Vietnam, China, South Korea and the Philippines.  Their main work is the education and formation of young people, with over 150,000 students worldwide.\n\nWolf says that the state of Benedictine monasteries around the world is often a reflection of the state of the church in the country where they live.  \n\nNotker Wolf\nAbbot Primate, Order of Saint Benedict\nThe monasteries reflect the demographic situation in a country, and also the situation regarding the faith in a country.  If there is really a strong faith, or if everything is secularized.  In a secularized world, there should not be as many vocations, but there are.  \n\nWolf says the most important issues for the Benedictine order are the celebration of the liturgy and community life.  But when it comes to their work, the members heed the words of Saint Benedict, who said only when you can live by the work of your own hand are you truly a monk. .\n\n---------------------\n\nSuscr\u00edbete al canal: http://smarturl.it/RomeReports\nVisita nuestra web: http://www.romereports.com/\n\nROME REPORTS, www.romereports.com, is an independent international TV News Agency based in Rome covering the activity of the Pope, the life of the Vatican and current social, cultural and religious debates.

It's one of the biggest trends right now is kind of a shorter style with a little bit more wave or texture. We do see styles moving from being so straight and so sleek, as far as short hair is concerned, moving into a more tousled or curled way.\n\nWith my model today, in her haircut she actually has lots of layers. So I'm going to style it kind of a softer, more wave. And one thing we notice a lot in these styles is it is smoother from the root, kind of, down. We don't start see the waves come till kind of midway down, which is great for short hair because it's always hard to curl the top and not look like it's too curled.\n\nSo what we're going to do, because she has these layers, is I'm going to section her hair off into two sections. If you had a haircut that was more one length, then you would just take big sections straight out to the side. So you would do the same thing I'm about to do to this first section, only you would do it to the whole section.\n\nSo I'm just going to take a top section here. The top of her ear is about right here, so it's a pretty big section. And I'm going to curl them moving straight out from the head. I think a lot of times with curls, our instinct is to always curl under. So we're doing the exact opposite. We're keeping it straight out, and then we're going to curl it.\n\nThere's a couple of different techniques you could do. For her hair, what I'd really like to do is a tonging technique. So what you're going to do is you're going to take your curling iron, and you're going to point it straight down. And you are just going to wrap the hair around your curling iron, holding the end in your hand. Hold it a couple of seconds, and then release it. And you get just a very soft little curl. I'll show you that again.\n\nAgain, take a pretty long section. Pull it straight out from the head. Point your curling iron down, and then wrap. This is such a great technique for shorter hair, because you have to do so many little sections, and it's a little bit easier, I think, to curl your hair, tonging it, with the short hair.\n\nSo I'm going to continue doing that all the way around to probably the middle of the back of the head. All the sections that I've done so far have been curled away from her face, and I'll continue to do the same thing on the other side.", "title": "Using Curling Iron on Short Hair Pt. 1 | Short Hairstyles", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T22:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-0kEGOayAoY", "description": "\u25baInfo & Cheap Booking! : http://www.hotelz.tv/info/italy/calambrone/XWveFfICbkL/residence-villaggio-solidago.html\n\u25baBest Hotels in Calambrone : http://www.hotelz.tv/search/Italy/calambrone/1.html\n\nSet just opposite a free beach Residence Villaggio Solidago offers self-catering accommodation and a free swimming pool.

The video explains what these verses, examined together, mean for your salvation.\n\n\"Follow\" me on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/crucifixwearer\n\"Like\" Answering Protestants on Facebook: \nhttp://facebook.com/AnsweringProtestants\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT ----------------------\n\nI was talking with one of my closest friends -- she's really more of a mentor to me, actually. After watching my video about asking the saints to pray for us, she made the assertion that, \"The saints haven't reached perfection; they are, however, in the presence of perfection!\" I make this video with all respect due to her.\n\nSome Protestants seem to try to make it sound as if any kind of perfection is totally unattainable. They point to verses like James 3:2, which includes the statement \"For we all stumble in many ways\". But in discussing this issue, that verse frequently gets taken out of context.\nThat part of James 3 is basically saying that Christians need to be careful about selecting their leaders, because bad leaders lead to bad, heretical teachings. It is not saying that it's impossible to reach perfection.\n\nChrist tells us in Matthew 5:48 that we are to be perfect, as our heavenly Father is perfect. So, according to some Protestants, either Christ is wrong, or He is just messing with our heads. Neither one of those options sound correct.\n\nAlso, it is pointed out in Hebrews 7:11 that perfection was not found through the Levitical priesthood. The chapter goes on to say that perfection can be found through Christ, who brings in \"a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\"\n\nAnd, like I mentioned in the saints video, Revelation 21:27 teaches us that nothing imperfect will enter Heaven.\n\nClearly, there's a possibility of reaching perfection.\n\nBut what do I mean by \"reaching perfection\"?\n\nI think Protestants tend to think that we are saying that it's possible to totally abstain from sin.\nBut perfection, in the end, is not only about sinlessness. After all, everyone has sinned.\n\nPutting aside the doctrine of Purgatory (which I plan to address in a future post or video), people, essentially, reach perfection by taking advantage of the graces that God has given us so that we might be closer to Him. And yes, this includes going to Confession and doing penance for our sins.\n\nWe must always remember, though, that this is not done completely by us, but with the help of Christ.\n\nAnyone that has reached Heaven, and thus pleased God, has reached perfection. Let's all try to be a little more perfect, then.", "title": "Answering Protestants: Reaching Perfection", "publishedDate": "2013-08-06T06:23:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "-0kUbL8PoXU", "description": "Check out this big tortoise looking at me.

14.47h \nEFE/DGGC\nRebajan del sueldo a un guardia civil por poner pocas multas afecta a un Destacamento de Tr\u00e1fico de Huelva \nLa Asociaci\u00f3n Unificada de la Guardia Civil (AUGC) ha denunciado este martes la retirada de un complemento de productividad a un agente por no haber impuesto las denuncias que sus superiores \"estiman oportunas\", por lo que se le ha descontado de la n\u00f3mina un complemento de 200 euros. \nEn un comunicado, la AUGC lamenta esta decisi\u00f3n que afecta a un guardia civil del Destacamento de Tr\u00e1fico de Huelva, al que se le descuenta la citada cantidad por el poco volumen de multas impuestas, \"atendiendo a las carreteras de la provincia y al volumen de circulaci\u00f3n\".\n\n\n\nAsegura el comunicado que el jefe del subsector ha considerado que no ha efectuado las denuncias que deb\u00eda imponer a los ciudadanos, independientemente de los accidentes en que hubiera intervenido, de los auxilios que hubiera prestado en carretera o de cualquier otra circunstancia.\nLa resoluci\u00f3n entregada al agente, remitida a Efe, se\u00f1ala que \"ha mantenido un bajo rendimiento en el puesto que desempe\u00f1a en el mes de devengo del complemento retributivo que nos ocupa, traducido este rendimiento o especial dedicaci\u00f3n en sus 15 servicios en carretera, de 8 horas de duraci\u00f3n cada uno, ha formulado 21 denuncias a la Ley de Seguridad Vial\". \nDesglosa que fueron dos por alcoholemia positiva en punto de verificaci\u00f3n, un atestado por accidente, ha participado en la instrucci\u00f3n de unas diligencias por alcoholemia positiva con un detenido y ha prestado 10 auxilios no informativos y 9 informativos, ha realizado 26 verificaciones y ha empleado 3 horas en regulaci\u00f3n del tr\u00e1fico. \nEn total, el agente ha recorrido 1.013 kil\u00f3metros en moto y 1.639 en coche, \"y todos estos datos le llevan a tener una desviaci\u00f3n porcentual del -42,29 % respecto de la media de su Unidad, el Destacamento de Huelva\". \nLos servicios jur\u00eddicos de AUGC, asociaci\u00f3n a la que pertenece el guardia civil afectado, va a presentar los escritos correspondientes ante el teniente coronel Jefe del Sector de Tr\u00e1fico de Sevilla, al considerar que dicha propuesta y disminuci\u00f3n de la n\u00f3mina \"se han realizado con una evidente desviaci\u00f3n de poder, y muestra que la intenci\u00f3n es de castigar a un guardia civil que no ha puesto las denuncias que \u00e9l considera necesarias\". \nLa nota se\u00f1ala que en casos anteriores \"este castigo tuvo una respuesta r\u00e1pida, las estad\u00edsticas de la Unidad aumentaron, y se multiplic\u00f3 el n\u00famero de denuncias impuestas a los ciudadanos\". \n\nhttp://www.abcdesevilla.es/20120522/andalucia/sevi-descuentan-euros-nomina-guardia-201205221255.html", "title": "ONEGA Y RAI : AUGC HUELVA DENUNCIA RETIRADA COMPLEMENTO COMPA\u00d1ERO DE TRAFICO.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-24T08:47:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-0lhe5ny-qc", "description": "Subscribe to the superaudiolearn Youtube Channel -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/superaudiolearn\n\nTo Watch our other Videos on Learn to Play Tabla -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpt5MJU62vc&list=PLmUEimMp8KrqrrYra5ZyNautodEEF7Q7k\n\nBecome a superaudiokids Fan on Facebook -\nhttps://www.facebook.com/superaudiomadras?ref=hl\n\nPlaylists\nLearn to Play Mridangam -

Breeding maturity is attained for males when they are a relatively modest 40 cm (16 in) long and weigh 1 kg (2.2 lb) and for females at 50 cm (20 in). However, they grow much larger throughout life, with males being larger than females] Most adult specimens will not exceed 1.5--2 m (4.9--6.6 ft) in length.However, the species can attain a maximum size of 3 m (9.8 ft). The largest specimen on record was an animal measuring 321 cm from Ceylon (Sri Lanka). A common mature weight of V. salvator can be 19.5 kg (43 lb). The maximum weight of the species is over 50 kg (110 lb). In exceptional cases, the species has been reported to attain 75 to 90 kg (165 to 198 lb), though most such reports are unverified and may be unreliable. They are the world's second-heaviest lizard, after the Komodo dragon.Their bodies are muscular, with a long, powerful, laterally compressed tails.

During this time the temple is well decorated with lights and idols. It is looked so beautiful.\n\nJhulan Yatra Mahotsava\nThis festival lasts for 13 days. It starts on the Tritya (third day) of the bright fortnight of Sravana (July-Aug) and lasts until the full moon night of the month. During this festival the Radha-Krishna Deities in the temples are swung on a swing. This is one of the biggest festivals of the year and Vrindavana is very crowded at this time. Often the swings are gold and silver. Some of the main temples that this festival is celebrated at are the Banke Bihari Temple and the Radha-Raman Temple in Vrindavana, the Dwarkadish temple in Mathura, and the Larily Lal Temple in Varsana.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura_district\n\nLord Krishna and Lord Jagannath are but the different incarnations of Vishnu as described in Jayadeva's Gitagovinda. Moreover due to strong Vaisnavism influence on the religious spirit of Orissa Lord Krishna is also widely worshipped and festivals like Jhulan Yatra are observed for Him. Between the Mukti-Mandap and the main temple on a raised open stage the Krishna-Radha idols are placed in a decorated swing and whole array of Leelas, Bhajans and festivities goes on till late night in the precinct of Jagannath temple. Though Vaishnavism prevailed in Orissa much earlier, the cult of Lord Krishna worship was made popular during the 15th century by Sri Chaitanya and his followers. Though temples exclusively dedicated to Krishna are few in Orissa, the representative deity of Lord Jagannath is no other than Krishna known as Madan Mohana, Ramakrishna, Gopala, Gopinatha etc. To the Vaishnavas the festival is known as Jhulan Purnima or the Swing festival which is observed in most of the Vishnu temples and monasteries following the cult. Beginning from the Tenth day of the bright fort-night, it culminates on the Purnima day. The metal images of Radha and Krishna are placed on beautifully decorated swings and nights are spent with singing and dancing in front of the deities. As an important festival of Lord Jagannath, the celebration of the festival in the shrine and monasteries at Puri attracts visitors from far and near. The festival in the temple was first initiated by the Gajapati king Dibyasingha Dev-II (1793-1798). It is celebrated for seven days from the Shrabana Shukla Dashami up to Pratipada. Madanmohan, the representative image of Jagannath alongwith Laxmi and Vishwadhatri are placed on a swing on the Muktimandap (called Jhulan Mandap). On the fullmoon day i. e. Jhulan Purnima or Gamha Purnima, the birthday of Lord Balabhadra is celebrated in the temple. In Puri, for the pleasure of Lord Jagannath's utsav vighraha (Madan-mohan ji, this festival is celebrated from Shravana Shukla Dashami (10th Tithi/phase of the Moon of the light fortnight) until Pratipada (1st tithi of the dark), a period of seven days. Sri Madanmohan, Jagannath's representative deity as well as Laxmi and Vishwadhatri are placed on a decorative wooden swing on Muktimandap (Jhulanmandap). There, worshippers have a chance to swing the Lord, thus entering into His pastimes. On the day of the full moon (Gamha Purnima or Jhulan Purnima), Lord Balabhadra's appearance day is celebrated, even this is also called as Balabhadra Purnima.\nJhulan Jatra celebrated for seven days from the Shrabana Shukla Dashami up to Pratipada. Madanmohan, the representative image of Jagannath alongwith Laxmi and Vishwadhatri are placed on a swing on the Muktimandap (called Jhulan Mandap) Traditionally, many of the Deities wears various clothing with green in it over this period until the Balaram Purnima or Jhulana Purnima. Again it is a practical festive service that the devotees provide for the Lord. The significance of this time is to find a breeze, as the air is heavy with the humidity of the rains. So the devotees arrange for the pleasure and satisfaction of the deities by placing them on a swing (Jhulan) and creating their own breeze from the motion. It is a most pleasing and satisfying festival, with the swings often highly decorated with forest creepers, Jasmine (Malati) that has newly blossomed in the season, and streamers of garlands. Sometimes they use a fine spray of rose water and direct it toward the Divine couple of Radha and Krishna on their swing.\nSource : http://puriwaves.nirmalya.in/festivals/jhulan-purnima#Jhulan_Purnima", "title": "Jhulan Yatra Celebration in Kathia Baba Temple at Sukchar, Sodepur", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T17:49:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-0xYAQ2UTag", "description": "this is mew\u00b4s theme song in pok\u00e9mon the first movie!\ni hope you enjoy it! ;)", "title": "Mews theme", "publishedDate": "2009-11-09T17:42:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-0xollWZ9Bo", "description": "Same bat time, same bat bar.

Sinek believes research should be done away from focus groups and in the field, especially in uncomfortable environments. His curiosity turns discomfort into a motivating factor he uses to better understand his subjects. Simon Sinek is a trained ethnographer who applies his curiosity around why people do what they do to teach leaders and companies how to inspire people. He is the author of \"Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action\". Sinek holds a BA degree in cultural anthropology from Brandeis University. \n\nView more Near Peer career videos: http://www.captureyourflag.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/captureyourflag\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/captureyourflag\n\nTranscript: \n\nErik Michielsen: How has your anthropology background proven helpful working in unfamiliar environments, including with the United States military?\n\nSimon Sinek: Being trained as an ethnographer being trained and sort of having this cultural anthropology background, significantly changes the way of how I do my work, or being in strange or different situations. This is why I\u2019m against focus groups. I think the concept of a focus group is laughable. That you bring people in to a sterile research environment, so that the researcher can be comfortable and safe and happy, but the respondents \u2013 the people who you want to be open and honest \u2013 are the ones who are uncomfortable and on-edge, that\u2019s backwards to me. \n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of the researcher to go to the respondents. It\u2019s the responsibility of the researcher to go into the environment, into the homes, into the societies, into the buildings, into the offices of the people that they want to study and understand. It\u2019s the responsibility of the researcher to deal with the discomfort, rather than forcing the respondent to be uncomfortable. \n\nSo that\u2019s how I was raised, both academically, and also that\u2019s how I was actually raised. I lived all over the world. As a kid, we traveled around a lot, and so I will always go to somebody if I\u2019m interested in them, and I believe they are the ones who should be comfortable and I\u2019m the one who should be uncomfortable. That\u2019s correct, because that way you get the best answers. And so, because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve always done things, I have no problem going to very unfamiliar environments. For me it\u2019s an object of curiosity, if I\u2019m uncomfortable I want to understand what\u2019s making me uncomfortable and I think that\u2019s kind of cool.", "title": "Simon Sinek: Childhood Influences on Cultural Anthropology Career Path", "publishedDate": "2011-04-11T20:53:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1NwC9-Ia0U", "description": "Audiostrobelight - Argyle\nFrom \"The Whole Shebang\" (2011)\n\nListen to the entire record here (YouTube Playlist): http://bit.ly/T8IYJw \n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/audiostrobelight\niTunes: http://iTunes.Teamstrobelight.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/audiostrobelite", "title": "Audiostrobelight - Argyle", "publishedDate": "2012-10-11T16:01:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1OOWQ7ZbLg", "description": "Check out these mental vets doing something very strange with a dog and a monkey!", "title": "Cross breeding fun!", "publishedDate": "2006-04-18T16:49:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1OpdgQSAUM", "description": "Samoan intro\nGuitar", "title": "Samoan Intro", "publishedDate": "2009-03-02T13:56:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1P9b55AzSQ", "description": "Les Spectres Du Bitume https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rap-Alternatif/151463408218464 pour telecharger http://spectresdubitume.free.fr/", "title": "Du bon temps - Cyanure, Teki Latex, Fuzati, Le jouage (Les spectres du bitume)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-11T20:02:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1PGWM_S-54", "description": "Mitt fo\u0308rsta projekt", "title": "Salv\u00f6r, galopp", "publishedDate": "2010-02-16T20:54:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1PLm5LeRkE", "description": "Geraniums means Gentility, Comfort, True Friend. \nGeraniums are a great starter to put in the middle of your Tussie-Mussie!

Simply put, ENITS is a provincial platform for the diagnosis and treatment of emergency head trauma patients.\n\nWorking with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, OHLTC, Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) and CritiCall Ontario, eHealth Ontario recently expanded ENITS to include stroke consultation. Now, OTN's 10 neurologists are registered and using ENITS. This means the province now has one common platform for all emergency neuro care, including not only head trauma, but stroke as well.\n\nThis initiative has life-saving implications. The ENITS system allows specialists and emergency room physicians to properly assess the stage and severity of the stroke and determine whether the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) injection is a viable option. If administered within two hours, tPA can prevent paralysis and even death.\n\nWatch, Tweet, Like, Subscribe and Share our videos.\n\nwww.ehealthontario.on.ca", "title": "Telestroke Joins eHealth Ontario's ENITS program", "publishedDate": "2014-02-03T15:38:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1PshWg7jls", "description": "Rep.

And this tip is...\n\n\"Believe It Is Possible\"\n\nScientists used to believe that humans responded to information flowing into the brain from the outside world. But what we now know is that instead, we respond to what the brain -- based on previous experience -- expects to happen next. \n\nIn fact, the mind is such a powerful instrument; it can deliver literally everything you want through the power of positive expectation.  \n\nBut you have to believe that what you want is possible.\n\nThis is why it's so important to always hold a positive expectation that what you want is going to happen.  It is simply a choice and a discipline of the mind.\n\nAnd as you commit to believing in yourself, also make a commitment to toning down the negative thinking and the complaints that you have in the complaint department of your head. Look at what you are complaining about. Think of all the things we complain about...\n\nI'm fat.  I'm tired. I can't get out of debt. I won't ever find a better job. I can't stand the relationship I have with my father. I'll never find a soul mate in this lifetime. \n\nTake the time to really examine your complaints because more than likely these are things you can actually do something about. These are not things being controlled by other people, other things or other events. They are things YOU can take constructive action on.\n\nAnd when you replace your old negative expectations with more positive ones... when you begin to believe that what you want truly is possible... your brain will actually take over the job of figuring out how to accomplish that possibility for you. \n\nIt will start to come up with creative ideas. It will start noticing resources and people in your environment that were always there, that can help you, and it will attract people and opportunities into your life.\n\nAnd ... better than that ... your brain will actually start to expect to achieve that outcome. But first you have to choose to believe that what you want is possible. Even if it feels like you are lying to yourself at first, I promise you...if you keep it up for 30 days in a row, and you're going to start noticing some amazing results.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nIt doesn't matter if your goals are to be the top sales person in your company, become a leading architect, lose weight, become a better parent, increase confidence, buy your dream home or make millions of dollars - Jack Canfield can help you develop a clear, personal plan of action that will completely transform your life into exactly what you want it to be.\n\u2003\nIf you liked this video, you'll love Jack's life-transforming products, dynamic in-person events and free resources found at http://JackCanfield.com/blog", "title": "The Importance of Believing It's Possible - Jack Canfield's Success Tip #3", "publishedDate": "2013-06-04T20:19:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1hc7MiHO6g", "description": "La hepatitis es una\u00a0inflamaci\u00f3n del h\u00edgado causada, generalmente, por\u00a0el virus de la hepatitis A, B, o C aunque tambi\u00e9n puede ser producida por alguna toxina o bacteria. \n\n\u25ba SUSCRIBETE ES GRATIS!!!\u00a0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pacvo5\n\u25ba S\u00cdGUEME EN GOOGLE PLUS\u00a0\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/103642184450524262051/posts\n\u25ba S\u00cdGUEME EN FACEBOOK\u00a0\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fran.ruiz.5682\n\u25ba S\u00cdGUEME EN TWITTER\u00a0\nhttps://twitter.com/followers", "title": "Remedios Naturales y Caseros para la Hepatitis", "publishedDate": "2013-12-12T19:07:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1i0zeC4T-o", "description": "Coming back from a fishing trip in Orkney.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS. \n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Georgia Tech vs Virginia Tech | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T20:45:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1lzGe6GlEU", "description": "Learn how to peel yucca root (yuca,cassava or tapioca) prior to cooking.

They're made with cotton and are lined with non-dyed nylon that is lead-free, phthalate-free, BPA-free and PVC-free (aka vinyl-free). It's a fantastic replacement to plastic bags since you won't have to keep buying them or throwing them out. It's also very stylish. If you take breakfast or lunch to go or if your kids take snacks to school with them, I'm sure you'll love these. It's very easy to open and close and the food won't fall out of it. After doing some research I found that some people microwave with plastic bags, can you believe it? Others even boil these bags with food inside! \"What's for dinner mom?? Lead!\"\n\nThese snack and sandwich bags can be used for nuts, fruits, veggies, sandwiches, and the nice thing on the small pouch bags is that you can tie it to anything, be it your baby cart, inside your purse, and even tie to a backpack if you're going for a hike or a picnic! What a brilliant idea. It won't give you extra weight to carry as some reusable metal boxes weight more and you can fold it when you're done. It's also great if you're in a diet and just want to carry a couple of handfull of snacks, not more, not less! They're very easy to clean, either with a wet cloth or just dump it in the washing machine and air dry them.\n\nI'm actually going to start doing the math for you, to take the work out of your shoulders, let's say you buy a pack of 3 which comes with 50 bags each (150 bags total), most people will either use it once, maybe twice and rarely three times, so let's go in the middle and say you'll use them 300 times.\n\nPlastic bags: $7.50 for 300 times (cheapest price)\nReusable bags: $9 for I'd say at least 1.5 years (547 times)\nThe difference is $2 for another 247 days in which you're saving $5 if you were to get another pack to last you another 300 days. On top of that they're at a discount today at $5.40 each.\n\nHopefully you can follow me, but since I'm a terrible instructor, I don't expect you to. But wait, now let's count the potential cost to your health and for these chemicals getting into your blood stream:\nBPA: $1?\nPVC: $2?\nLead: $3?\nPhthalate: $1?\nHospital bill? Priceless\n\nOh and wait! What about the environmental cost? Plastic take centuries to biodegrade, now imagine every individual in the US using one snack plastic bag per day? That's 300 million going to landfills and I'm not even counting the grocery store bags because then you'd just faint on the staggering number!\n\nMy point is that you don't put a price tag in putting your health in danger, since hospital bills can go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's not even counting the headache, the mental cost, and the entire family being down, etc.\n\nBeneterre bags come in a variety of colors to choose from and very cute designs that are not only for kids but also for adults (I'm a huge fan of mine!). It's a great replacement for disposable bags, foil and plastic wraps.", "title": "Reusable Sandwich Bags", "publishedDate": "2011-05-26T06:08:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1tDPnUbskc", "description": "Thanks for watching please drop a like and subscribe!\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwl2glmqC0\nFree Gems in safari: m.freemyapps.com/share/url/d3238526\nIntro Song: Passion Pit - Take a Walk\nCheckout my  friends Music: https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDGBeatz\nIntro created by: https://www.youtube.com/user/PixelArtsy", "title": "Clash of Clans - TH9 - Hybrid Base (Anti Hog) The Tornado", "publishedDate": "2014-06-28T23:22:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-1tE4S3hn2Q", "description": "\u2022 Follow Me\n\u25ba Facebook - http://facebook.com/king.gothalion\n\u25ba Twitter - https://twitter.com/Gothalion\n\u25ba Twitch - http://www.twitch.tv/KingGothalion\n\u25ba Steam Group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GothalionFriends", "title": "WILL IT BORE?!

However, fluid flowing through a granular material such as sand is still not possible within current frameworks. In this paper, we present the simulation of fine granular materials interacting with fluids. We propose a unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics framework for the simulation of both fluid and granular material. The granular volume is simulated as a continuous material sampled by particles. By incorporating previous work on porous flow in this simulation framework we are able to fully couple fluid and sand. Fluid can now percolate between sand grains and influence the physical properties of the sand volume. Our method demonstrates various new effects such as dry soil transforming into mud pools by rain or rigid sand structures being eroded by waves.\nToon Lenaerts and Philip Dutr\u00e9, Katholieke Universiteit Leuve\nMore info: http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/cwis/research/graphics/CGRG.PUBLICATIONS/MixingFluidsAndGranularMaterials/", "title": "Mixing Fluids and Granular Materials", "publishedDate": "2008-12-12T12:44:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-22PW8cXRkU", "description": "Streets near the neighborhood of Biwi, in Lilongwe, Malawi: you can buy almost anything along this street.

I take no credit at all, as my Sifu just showed some superior blocking skills.  If you know what to look for you can see tons of different concepts being applied.  The 1st thing to notice is that a skilled practioner really just blocks the majority of the time, the unskilled, tries to cover that up by simply blizting the attack.  Its very common in the wing chun world for many to do that.\n\nAlso, what how blocks come about, its not done by the hand but by the body.  You can visually see this since sifu's center stays consistent throughout, and simply turns in conjunction with the amount of force, while the hands don't chase out which is a common no no in wing chun.  Let the attacks come to your house, and the closer they are the safer it is for you.  All to often, people will shoot out their hands trying to reach out to block.\n\nBlocking is a simple concept but difficult to do, know the person's centerline, have your triangle constantly point to that indivudals center line, and go with the force.  While there are many more concepts involved these are the general three which one must follow to develop superior blocking skills.\n\nFinally in some glimpses you see freezing out motions, where you can literally lock out your opponents motions, by simply holding your structure and techincally freezing his hand motion.  All to often wing chun is confused with the concept of sticky hands.  Sticky hands is not about sticking to people, its making people stick to you.  Out in the street, people will not do sticky hands in a real fight, what your developing is the ability so that people will stick to your hands.  In a simple concept imagine your hands as blades, if you position your blades in the right angle, whatever touches it will cut into it, thus forcing that individual to stick.\n\nAnyway, if you want to get good in wing chun, practice blocking more then attacking.  If you can block anything thrown at you, you can then attack at will.", "title": "Wing Chun - SUPERIOR BLOCKING 1", "publishedDate": "2006-06-20T22:27:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-23LjaM0ixc", "description": "Josh Davis singing", "title": "By the Touch of the Master's Hand", "publishedDate": "2010-11-22T03:45:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-23qqKcz7j8", "description": "", "title": "Civil Defense Eruption Update - November 1, 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T19:20:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-24aCoPY31k", "description": "Vale a pena ouvir, mas a imagem ficou escura.\n\n \"Country Woman\", do Demented Are Go", "title": "Hillbilly Rawhide - Country Woman (do Demented Are Go)", "publishedDate": "2010-07-05T13:24:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-24dV32e1TM", "description": "Dat finger, precious.\nFrom an editor with 373 subs.\n\nThis was an Counter Strike: Global Offensive Frag Clip called \"NIGHTERN II\" by tEGO\n\nEditor: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/tEGO810\n\n\nWATCH OTHER EDITS:\nHardcore/Rock: http://bit.ly/rockcore2014\nDubstep/Dnb/Electro: http://bit.ly/dubstep2014\nChill/Glitch: http://bit.ly/chill2014\nRap/RnB: http://bit.ly/Rap2014\nEpic Edits: http://bit.ly/Epic2014\nFragMovies/Montages: http://bit.ly/Big2014\n\n\nTOP 5 EDITS: \nhttp://bit.ly/Top5edits\n\n\nWant some FUNNY/EPIC T-SHIRTS?!\nhttp://3n19ma.spreadshirt.net/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHow to Submit your Video:\n\n-You can Submit any video from any game.\n-Your video must have good content & great edit!\n-Download our INTRO and use it in your edit (http://bit.ly/T3ChdINTROs).\n-Please don't send any copyrighted content.\n-Send it by PM (Private Message)\n-If your edit is 60fps send the HD link.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nHis Words:\n\"Hi guys !

Today I'm at JDS Nursery taking in some of the new color for the spring and summer season. A favorite of mine is the snapdragon relative Nemesia, that colorful annual from South Africa. The beautiful flowers are a half inch in diameter and the interior is bearded. I find these small flowers have an aroma that reminds me of vanilla. Newer selections include honey Blue Eye which is soft violet blue. Pink Fruticans is a nice pastel pink and pure Honey White. Spicy Snow White is a larger, more open selection. Verbena with their spreading growth habit have been garden staples for many years. The foliage is a rich green color and has a spicy aroma when brushed. The flower clusters are displayed above the foliage. The Lanai series offers some spectacular choices in flower colors. Twister Pink flowers are pink in the middle and have an outer ring of white with light pink edges. Premium Candy Cane is appropriately named. The flowers have alternating red and white stripes just like that favorite Christmas treat. Lanai Strawberry and Cream flower clusters are a mixture of soft pinks and salmon colors. A perennial I really enjoy is the thread-leaf coreopsis and here are three Coloropsus selections with exciting two inch flowers. Limbo has bright white flowers with dark eyes. The flowers of Salsa are golden yellow with a wide burgundy eye and Jive has white flowers with a burgundy eye and orange center. So my advice is to get out to the garden center and pick some of the beautiful and colorful plants for your landscape this year.

The situation in Syria is part of the Arab Spring, a wave of social upheaval throughout the Arab World demanding greater political freedom and an end to autocracy. Inspired by the successful revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, Syrian protesters have employed the use of tactics such as marches, hunger strikes, rioting, and vandalism, in a sustained campaign of civil resistance aimed at ending nearly five decades of Ba'athist rule.

The Geodesic Dome Calculator is at:  http://www.ziptiedomes.com/calcindex.htm\n\nOur current production hubs are set up for 1\" PVC pipe, and this is the only size pipe you should use. For good structural support, the maximum length of 1\" PVC pipe should not be more than 5 feet in length.\n\nOn our Geodesic Dome Calculators, the Blue Strut is always the longest strut.  For maximum dome size, set the Blue Strut to \"5\".\n\nTo effectively use your material, set the Blue Strut to 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 of 10 feet.  To do this, enter a Blue Strut length of 5, 3.3333, or 2.5.  \n\nIf you are using 20 foot pipe, you can cut your Blue Struts 4 feet in length with no waste.  The Cost of Materials section of our Geodesic Dome Calculator will allow you to enter in a 20 foot pipe length to help you determine the most efficient strut size.\n\nIf you are using 1\" EMT Conduit, the OD is slightly smaller than 1\" PVC. We can create a custom hub for 1\" or 3/4\" EMT, just call us and let us know.  The EMT should not be longer than 5' in length, as a 10' EMT puts too much leverage on the plastic hubs.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It was going to be replaced by Legends of Chima originally, but after the announcement of its continuation the two themes will both exist simultaneously.\n\nThe theme takes very little influence from the previous Ninja theme, instead introducing a variety of elements such as a more modern setting, enemies such as Lord Garmadon, Skulkin, the Serpentine, Stone Army, the Overlord, and Nindroids and a battle game known as \"Spinjitzu\", with spinner sets for in 2011 and 2012, which were discontinued in 2013. \n\nThe Techno Robes were introduced in the Rebooted series and the Sets 70720 - 70728. It is a new robe for the five ninja, for more style and strength. In the sets, they include a new weapon known as the Techno Blades. Those will be more updated to hack into the Overlord's systems. In Ninjago REBOOTED, the Techno Robes and Blades were made by Cyrus Borg. \n\nLong before time had a name, the world of Ninjago was created by the first Spinjitzu master, by using the four weapons of Spinjitzu: The Scythe of Quakes, The Nunchucks of Lightning, the Shurikens of Ice, and the Sword of Fire. The weapons were so powerful, that no one could handle all of their power at one time. When the spinjitzu master passed away, his two sons, Sensei Wu and Oldest/Sensei Garmadon swore to protect them, but Lord Garmadon was consumed by darkness, and wanted to possess them. A battle between the two brothers broke out, and the oldest was struck down and banished to the underworld. Peace returned, and the younger brother hid the weapons, but knowing his older brother's relentless ambition for power, he placed a guardian to protect them, and for fear of his own demise, a map for an honest man to hide. As Garmadon cannot leave the Underworld, he struck a deal with Samukai and his skeleton army. In preparation, Sensei Wu gathered four young ninja, Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane, to learn the ways of Spinjitzu, and stop Lord Garmadon. After months of training, the four ninja began their quest to find the Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu to stop Garmadon's evil plans, and travel to the Caves of Despair to retrieve the Scythe of Quakes. After narrowly escaping a dragon protecting the weapon, the Ninja found the Nunchucks of Lightning and the Shurikens of Ice next, while Samukai's skeletal legions followed them. Kai was lured into a trap at the Fire Temple by Lord Garmadon, and the skeletons stole the three weapons, but Sensei Wu detained his brother's plan to unite the weapons at the temple by travelling to the Underworld with the last weapon, the Sword of Fire. After allying themselves with the four dragons, they journeyed to the Underworld to help Sensei and stop Garmadon once and for all. Using the Tornado of Creation, they destroyed the skeletons and made their way to the throne room of Garmadon's Dark Fortress, where a battle between Wu and Samukai broke out for the possession of the four weapons. Sensei was defeated, and Samukai, having possession of all four weapons, betrayed Garmadon and demanded he obey him, but he is destroyed by all the weapon's power, as Garmadon planned, and creates a portal through space and time that he travels through to grow strong enough to possess the Golden Weapons. After returning to the surface world, Sensei Wu knew Garmadon will one day return, and that the battle for Ninjago had only begun.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR WATCHING!", "title": "LEGO Ninjago NRG Full Potential KnockOff Minifigures Set 6 (Bootleg)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T18:43:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2Yge7zd9rg", "description": "http://goo.gl/\n\nComo acortar un link o url con Goo gl 2014", "title": "Como acortar un link o url con Goo.gl 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-01-26T02:41:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2ZDt17-L7s", "description": "Written, directed & edited by Eric Sheffield\n\nStarring Andy Sheffield & Alexandra Hensley\n\nShot by Garret Lamb\n\nLighting by Ben Kilmer", "title": "Spoon Me", "publishedDate": "2013-06-20T20:29:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2ZESJAWeZM", "description": "My male small green singer, I really like his song also.", "title": "Finch Green Singer Song (Serinus mozambicus )", "publishedDate": "2007-11-22T02:30:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2ZFgAOiKNo", "description": "Badai Bungalow - Aju Varghese Special Episode 49 Promo 01\n\nVisit Our Site: http://www.asianetglobal.com\n\nSubscribe to Asianet Official YouTube Channel for more videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=asianetindia\n\nFor Asianet News and Updates LIKE our Facebook Page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Asianet\n\nand follow us on Twitter:\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/asianet", "title": "Badai Bungalow - Aju Varghese Special Episode 49 Promo 01", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T05:55:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2ZiwVWt7Ok", "description": "Primer extraido del disco \"SMILE\"\nARTISTA: CHARLES ANS\nMUSICA: TEEAM REVOLVER\nEDICION MUSICAL: RAZOR\nVIDEO: GONE", "title": "CHARLES ANS - SI NUNCA VA AMANECER / \"Por los martes que me diste\".", "publishedDate": "2014-07-25T23:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2ZkJd4u0Us", "description": "die kleinen s\u00fc\u00dfen dinger und der computer", "title": "yip yip's der computer", "publishedDate": "2007-02-08T08:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2_1jWdB5vU", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muc9dZwna8U\n\nSatanophobia treatment, Satanophobia cure, Satanophobia list, Satanophobia solutions, how to cure Satanophobia, treat Satanophobia without medication, Satanophobia symptoms", "title": "Satanophobia Treatment", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T04:41:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2_JL5bPVPw", "description": "", "title": "skate bilbao boardx 5", "publishedDate": "2011-09-03T10:20:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2__pOExmJw", "description": "", "title": "\u5927\u5834\u3086\u3044\u00d7WEEKDAY\u00d7PRESTIGE", "publishedDate": "2013-11-17T18:22:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2_dOuEXLKw", "description": "Wenn\u00b4s mal wieder l\u00e4nger dauert...\nDie Kickiflip Indy Versuche\n\nwww.stp-skate.com\nSkateboarding St. P\u00f6lten", "title": "Gnomi uncut - Skatehalle Linz", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T19:29:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2_kk_RiLkg", "description": "DEMO II\n\n\"Drop out of life with a bullet in my head or a needle in my vein\"\n\nwhitepig.bandcamp.com", "title": "Oaf - Buried Alive II", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T04:32:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2_km-xdCgE", "description": "Music ACE COMBAT 3 Soundtrack... to more music suscribe to my chanel.", "title": "ACE COMBAT 3 -  The Execution", "publishedDate": "2008-07-25T21:43:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2a2KWwVGWg", "description": "It\u2019s a video game museum where everything is for sale.\n\nNot in New York?

He had some problems. He was a bit rebellious. He had a bad attitude. So much so, that when God would tell him to go one direction Jonah would go the opposite direction. \n\nJonah's attitude problems created some more problems along the way, but yet the beautiful thing about it... the amazing thing about it... is that none of it took God by surprise. In fact, God had prepared in advance for Jonah's rebelliousness because God loved Jonah and wanted to do something in Jonah and through Jonah for Jonah's benefit and also for the benefit of some other people. \n\nNow when it comes to the book of Jonah, the first thing people think about is Jonah and the fish. Many even say it is a work of fiction. But let me tell ya, I believe it's more than just a fish story. I believe it is the truth. I believe that Jonah was a real person and the things we are going to read about really happened. Why? Well, first of all, in other places in the Bible, like Second Kings chapter fourteen verse twenty-five, Jonah is referred to as a real life guy... an actual person who lived. It calls him a prophet and even tells us where his hometown was.\n\nEven more important than what it says in Second Kings, Christ Jesus Himself referred back to Jonah as a real person. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus was being harassed by the religious leaders (which was a very common thing) and in the midst of their harassing they said, \"Come on man show us some proof that you are who you claim to be. Give us some proof that you have the right to be doing and saying the things you are doing and saying. Give us a sign.\"\n\nAnd Jesus in response basically said this. \"An evil and faithless generation seeks after a sign, but you guys aren't going to get any sign at all except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\"\n\nJonah by the way, had lived quiet a long time before Jesus.\n\nThen Jesus said this, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\"\n\nAs Jesus was prophesying about His death and resurrection, He says, \"Just like Jonah was three days and three nights in a fish... listen buddy... I'm going to be three days and three nights in a grave. But just as Jonah came up out of that fish, I am going to come up out of the grave.\"\n\nWe will talk more about Jonah in the coming days.\n\nThank you for listening and reading.\nJames Flanders\n\nhttp://ezinearticles.com/?Grace,-Faith,-Works,-And-Our-Weaknesses&id=8014735", "title": "Jonah - Is It More Than A Fish Story (James Flanders)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T15:59:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2fGq58jsW0", "description": "Now this I hope to god is not the final version of the song.

They will connect and sleep up to four adults, but they are a lot more expensive than the cozy roommettes. \n\nRoommettes are small compartments that will sleep up to two adults. They have a toilet and sink en suite, plus there is a shared shower in the car for roommette passengers to share.

So your coach base fare for 1 or 2 passengers is added to the flat fee for the sleeper compartment. \n\nI will say, I was disappointed with the quality of the dinner meal on this train. We've dined on the Silver Star in Florida before and the food was much better in quality and portion. But that train has a dedicated dining car, whereas the Cardinal's dining area is shared with the cafe, so kitchen space is very limited. \n\nWe felt very spoiled having our own roommette on this trip, and it was very comfortable to sleep flat in a bed rather than in the coach recliners, which aren't bad. \n\nWe love Amtrak travel and use it at every opportunity.", "title": "Tour of Amtrak Viewliner sleeping car with Accessible Bedroom, Bedroom, and Roommettes", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T20:39:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2sT_B4goOA", "description": "Big 4x4 weird split rear, big coastal blacktail hard rutting. chased this poor deer around all day. thank god for good genes.", "title": "Blacktail Rut", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T23:41:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2sp2OwKups", "description": "", "title": "22 Ionian - 1st Slash Style Lick", "publishedDate": "2014-03-05T15:47:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-2srehHZamQ", "description": "Ayo pilih member favorit kalian untuk tampil dalam single ke-6 JKT48!\n\n***\nYou can keep or share this video, but please DO NOT re-upload it into any streaming site and file hosting.
