Marcos. It became effective throughout the entire country on 21 September 1972, and was announced to the public two days later. It was formally lifted on 17 January 1981, six months before the first presidential election in the Philippines in twelve years.\n\nUnder the pretext of an assassination of then-Defence Secretary (now Senator) Juan Ponce Enrile and an ensuing Communist insurgency, President Marcos enacted the Proclamation that he might be able to rule by military power.\n\nHe initially signed the Proclamation on 17 September 1972, but it was postdated to 21 September because of Marcos' superstitions and numerological beliefs. Marcos formally announced the Proclamation in a live television and radio broadcast from Malaca\u00f1ang Palace a further two days later on the evening of 23 September 1972.\n\nThe following year, President Marcos replaced the 1935 Constitution with a new one that changed the system of government from a presidential to a parliamentary one, with himself remaining in power as both head of state (with the title \"President\") and head of government (titled \"Prime Minister\"). President Marcos also manipulated elections and had his political coalition--the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL; English: New Society Movement)--control the unicameral legislature he created, known as the Batasang Pambansa.\n\nPresident Marcos formally lifted Martial Law on 17 January 1981, several weeks before the first pastoral visit of Pope John Paul II to the Philippines for the beatification of Lorenzo Ruiz.

Although geckel performs better than a gecko foot would underwater, it \"is many times lower in adhesion than, say,what a mussel achieves in its native environment,\"  http://www.livescience.com/technology/070718_gecko_mussels.html\n\nInspiration for the Adhesive\nThe team drew the inspiration for the adhesive from Geckos, which can support hundreds of times their own body weight. Geckos are able to do this because of billions of hair-like structures, known as setae. Researchers combined this ability with the sticking power of mussels. The material is reusable, as tests have shown that \"the material could be stuck and unstuck more than 1,000 times, even when used under water\", retaining 85 percent of their adhesive strength. [2]\n\nMedical Applications\nProfessor Phillip Messersmith from Northwestern University in Chicago, the lead researcher on the team that developed the product, believes that the adhesive could have many medical applications. For example, tapes that could replace sutures to close a wound and a water resistant adhesive for bandages and drug-delivery patches.

The video was apparently shot by a camera worn on the man's helmet and it also shows his companion, a young woman, assisting him in recording the stunt.\n\nThe pair is believed to have boarded the Peak 2 Peak gondola at around 3:45 p.m. The video shows the doors being held open with some kind of cable or belt, and a statement issued by Whistler said they believe the man used brute force to pry them open. There was damage to the opening and locking systems of the gondola and repairs are estimated to cost about $10,000. \n\nPolice arrested a woman they believe was shown in the video, an employee of Longhorn Saloon and Grill in Whistler. Reports said authorities also know the identity of the jumper, though they have yet been able to locate him.\n\nIt is suspected that the jumper in the video was copying a stunt completed by pro-skiier and BASE jumper, Shane McConkey, in 2008, the year the Peak 2 Peak Gondola was opened. As the man falls to earth, he can be heard yelling McConkey's name. McConkey was killed in 2009 in a cliff jumping accident during a film shoot in Italy.\n\nPolice said they are seeking an arrest warrant for the man in the video, as well as charges of mischief over $5,000.\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

Up to 800 people were killed and 100,000 became homeless following the Mount Pinatubo eruption, which climaxed with nine hours of eruption on June 15, 1991. On June 15, millions of tons of sulfur dioxide were discharged into the atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in the temperature worldwide over the next few years.\nMount Pinatubo is part of a chain of composite volcanoes along the Luzon arc on the west coast of the island (area map). The arc of volcanoes is due to the subduction of the Manila trench to the west. The volcano experienced major eruptions approximately 500, 3000, and 5500 years ago.\n\nThe events of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption began in July 1990, when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurred 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of the Pinatubo region, determined to be a result of the reawakening of Mount Pinatubo.\n\nIn mid-March 1991, villagers around Mount Pinatubo began feeling earthquakes and vulcanologists began to study the mountain. (Approximately 30,000 people lived on the flanks of the volcano prior to the disaster.) On April 2, small explosions from vents dusted local villages with ash. The first evacuations of 5,000 people were ordered later that month.\n\nEarthquakes and explosions continued. On June 5, a Level 3 alert was issued for two weeks due to the possibility of a major eruption. The extrusion of a lava dome on June 7 led to the issuance of a Level 5 alert on June 9, indicating an eruption in progress. An evacuation area 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) away from the volcano was established and 25,000 people were evacuated.\n\nThe following day (June 10), Clark Air Base, a U.S. military installation near the volcano, was evacuated. The 18,000 personnel and their families were transported to Subic Bay Naval Station and most were returned to the United States. On June 12, the danger radius was extended to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the volcano resulting in the total evacuation of 58,000 people.\n\nOn June 15, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo began at 1:42 p.m. local time. The eruption lasted for nine hours and caused numerous large earthquakes due to the collapse of the summit of Mount Pinatubo and the creation of a caldera. The caldera reduced the peak from 1745 meters (5725 feet) to 1485 meters (4872 feet) high is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in diameter.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of the eruption Tropical Storm Yunya was passing 75 km (47 miles) to the northeast of Mount Pinatubo, causing a large amount of rainfall in the region. The ash that was ejected from the volcano mixed with the water vapor in the air to cause a rainfall of tephra that fell across almost the entire island of Luzon. The greatest thickness of ash deposited 33 centimeters (13 inches) approximately 10.5 km (6.5 mi) southwest of the volcano. There was 10 cm of ash covering an area of 2000 square kilometers (772 square miles). Most of the 200 to 800 people (accounts vary) who died during the eruption died due to the weight of the ash collapsing roofs and killing to occupants. Had Tropical Storm Yunya not been nearby, the death toll from the volcano would have been much lower.\n\nThe eruption plume of Mount Pinatubo's various gases and ash reached high into the atmosphere within two hours of the eruption, attaining an altitude of 34 km (21 miles) high and over 400 km (250 miles) wide. This eruption was the largest disturbance of the stratosphere since the eruption of Krakatau in 1883 (but ten times larger than Mount St. Helens in 1980). The aerosol cloud spread around the earth in two weeks and covered the planet within a year. During 1992 and 1993, the Ozone hole over Antarctica reached an unprecedented size.\n\nThe cloud over the earth reduced global temperatures. In 1992 and 1993, the average temperature in the Northern Hemisphere was reduced 0.5 to 0.6\u00b0C and the entire planet was cooled 0.4 to 0.5\u00b0C. The maximum reduction in global temperature occurred in August 1992 with a reduction of 0.73\u00b0C. The eruption is believed to have influenced such events as 1993 floods along the Mississippi river and the drought in the Sahel region of Africa. The United States experienced its third coldest and third wettest summer in 77 years during 1992.", "title": "20th Century's 2nd Largest Volcanic Eruption - Mt Pinatubo-Eruption", "publishedDate": "2013-05-20T13:00:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y5yLocAOMc", "description": "Chemtrails", "title": "Chemtrails / Canada", "publishedDate": "2013-05-02T01:20:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y73XwSSyxc", "description": "\u89b3\u97f3 Kannon\n\nSanzen-in Temple, \u014chara, Kyoto\n\n(rows of miniature statues of Kannon\n that were donated to the temple by visitors)\n\nKannon (skt.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "new 2015 2015 BMW i8 IN FULL ACTION AT NORDSCHLEIFE", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y8P7oTil6E", "description": "CITROEN C6 PART 3/4", "title": "CITRO\u00cbN C6 PART 3/4", "publishedDate": "2006-07-28T19:52:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y8deu3gceY", "description": "ReEnacted WWII 60mm Mortar Fire Mission (Rockford 2011)", "title": "WWII 60mm Mortar Fire Mission", "publishedDate": "2011-10-29T06:12:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y8dfhlEt94", "description": "Via amdraci.ro\n23/2/13", "title": "RARESH & DAN ANDREI @ Guesthouse", "publishedDate": "2013-02-27T06:24:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y91TgYFcH4", "description": "", "title": "GTA 5 isole  misteriose", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T19:33:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8y9Go5cBx94", "description": "This is the official drum track for the song, extracted from the Rock Band game.

In patients of the main group the diagnosis was complicated with posterior polar cataract in 5 eyes, hypermature cataract in 2 eyes, endothelial dystrophy of cornea in 8 eyes. Control group consisted of 100 eyes with diagnosis of mature cataract with density of the nucleus equal to 4-5 grade. On every eye phacoemulsification(PE) with implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens was performed (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.).  Microcoaxial PE was performed with the help of torsional phacotip OZIL with software IP, Akahoshi needle through 2,0 mm incision with Infiniti Vision System and Intrepid System (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.).  On the different stages of PE viscoelastics Provisc, Viscoat, Celoftal and irrigation solution BSS (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) were used. All the surgeries were performed under topical and intracameral anesthesia. The following parameters of phacodynamics were used: power of traditional ultrasound with linear control from 0 to 100%, fixed torsional ultrasound 100%, aspiration speed 30 ml/min, fixed level of vacuum 400 mm Hg, level of dynamic rise +3 with linear control, height of irrigation solution bottle was 140 cm. In two eyes of the main group with hypermature cataract the \"runaway\" of anterior capsulorhexis was observed during PE. In those cases and in 5 eyes with posterior polar cataract PE was performed in anterior chamber.\n     The safety of surgery was estimated on the basis of quantification of intraoperational, postoperational complications, density of endothelial cells, dynamics of visual function recovery.\n     Results.\n\nThere were no intraoperational complications observed in the main (except two cases of \"runaway\" of anterior capsulorhexis) and control group. The quantity of postsurgical complications was not significant and did not differ significantly in both groups. All the complications were successfully treated medically and did not influence the terms of visual function recovery in both groups. The endothelial cell loss in the main group was 15+/-5,6% and 12+/-6,7% in the control group. The difference is statistically insignificant. \n  Conclusion\nEffects of less repulsion, predominant followability of the lens on the end of phacotip, constant shearing effect during torsional ultrasound and less post-occlusion surge allow performing PE of dense nuclei in anterior chamber without significant trauma to endothelial cells. Under the condition of usage of listed effects in complex with viscoelastics and BSS - PE is the preferred method of cataract extraction in cases of posterior polar cataracts, runaway of anterior capsulorhexis and endothelial dystrophies even in combination with nuclei of high density.", "title": "Phacoemulsification in anterior chamber (running capsulorhexis, argentina flag syndrome)", "publishedDate": "2011-08-31T19:50:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yEx7OXRGOU", "description": "anthony was diagnosed with an allergy to penicillin... this is day two of the rash.  we have been giving him zyertec once a day and rubbing him down with anti-itch cream.  \n\nhe had been taking to penicillin for nine days before anything showed up. \n\naccording to the pediatrician there is no way to test for a penicillin allergy and you could take it once or fifty times before your body reacts to it.", "title": "allergic reaction to penicillin", "publishedDate": "2010-03-07T14:04:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yExKN5bWRo", "description": "", "title": "The Oort Cloud", "publishedDate": "2013-12-30T18:02:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yF1Gl5Zy6E", "description": "download link here: https://soundcloud.com/paul-tong/all-gummed-warmed-up-inside\nfor those adventure time fanatics (including me)", "title": "All Gummed/Warmed up inside (Piano cover) - Adventure Time", "publishedDate": "2013-06-19T17:10:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yF7bOzCxvE", "description": "Shot in Joshua Tree National Park, California, USA.

The order contains a single family, with only two extant genera.

Onions have rich sulfur content in them. Onion juices when applied on the scalp alone or in combination with other hair loss remedies can improve the blood circulation to the scalp. Sulfur also improves the production of collagen tissues which is necessary for the growth of hair. Hair grows from the hair follicles in the scalp and increased blood supply to the scalp brings better nutrients and nourishment to the follicles and promotes hair growth. The sulfur content in the juice also has anti-bacterial properties and prevents the growth of fungi and bacteria on the scalp which reduces the chances of losing hair due to these infections. Onion juice increases the strength of the hair and prevents thinning and breakage. You can achieve improved volume to your hair by regularly applying the onion juice on the scalp.\n\nCan Onion Help In Hair Growth?\nMost of the people are skeptical about the use of onion for hair growth. Most of you will be thinking can onion help in hair growth? The scientific studies on natural remedies for hair loss has proven that applying onion juice and consuming onions is helpful in controlling hair loss and other problems related to hair such as dandruff, fungal infections and  yeast infections. It has been found that onion juice is also effective in preventing premature graying of hair.\n\nNatural And Safe Method\nIt is completely safe to use onion for preventing hair loss and promoting hair growth as onion helps in hair growth without any side effects or causing allergies. There is no need to use harsh chemicals on your hair when you have an easily available, cheap and safe method for promoting hair growth. You can use onion as a natural remedy if you have receding hair line or bald patches. You may not be able to get the same result when you opt for hair loss treatment from costly hair spas.", "title": "How Onion Helps in Hair Growth", "publishedDate": "2014-09-20T12:19:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yIMThuj6Io", "description": "Allen Carlins, MD is an Otolaryngologist (Ear, Nose and Throat physician) at Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital.

Schofield, Alisa Tager\nScreenwriter: Jean-Jacques Annaud, Alain Godard\nFilm Description: A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper.\n\n\"enemy at the gates\",\"enemy at the gates clip\",\"enemy at the gates part 1\",\"enemy at the gates trailer\",\"jude law\",\"flag videos\",\"gun videos\",\"megaphone videos\",war,drama,\"history social studies\",thriller,\"john d schofield\",\"roland pellegrino\",\"alisa tager\",\"jean-jacques annaud\",\"alain godard\",\"jrg reichl\",\"violence videos\",\"war videos\",\"beach videos\",\"boat videos\",\"river videos\",\"russia videos\",\"war zone videos\",\"young vassili zaitsev\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++237768,/m/01r93l", "title": "Enemy at the Gates (1/9) Movie CLIP - Crossing the Volga (2001) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-05-23T17:11:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yOL-8v7WmM", "description": "phil ruiz at the galaxy theatre timbale solo with water", "title": "timbale solo", "publishedDate": "2010-04-13T01:50:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yOM-IL_D8I", "description": "Marissa Bergougnou performing \"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\"", "title": "Marissa - The Simple Joys of Maidenhood", "publishedDate": "2010-07-31T16:22:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yOTmDTwlDM", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/user/caltexrecordsmusic?feature=mhee#g/p\nhttp://www.caltexrecords.com\nSiavash Ghomayshi Old Songs, Siavash Ghomayshi Love Songs, Siavash Ghomeishi, Siavash Ghomayshi 2012 \nPersian Music", "title": "Siavash Ghomayshi - Gerye Kon | \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0634 \u0642\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u06cc - \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0647 \u06a9\u0646", "publishedDate": "2009-07-04T18:03:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yOlPeW9gv4", "description": "Get your leash at my store http://micbergsma.tv \n\nDon't forget to watch in HD!\nComment, Thumbs up, Share, and Subscribe!\n\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/user/micbergsma\nSubscribe to Mitch's Scooter Stuff: http://www.youtube.com/mitchsscooterstuff\nLike me on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/MicBergsma-Productions/310377095667250\nLike Mitch's Scooter Stuff on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mitchs-Scooter-Stuff/100627433331172\nFollow me on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/micbergsma\nFollow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/micbergsma\n\nGoPro Tip Playlists\nPart 1: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2C8A05930503821\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAm8fdjvx0aWqwChHiAmujZgka9EQsxp\nGoPro Tip Intro by: http://sidekickanimation.com/", "title": "Leash By Big Kahuna Camera Mounts - GoPro Tip #31", "publishedDate": "2012-11-02T13:53:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yOmU6ztWPM", "description": "How to tell the difference between a federalist and anti-federalist-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

Biblically known as hyssop, an ancient remedy, many recent studies by leading institutions have shown origanum vulgare's ability to eliminate bacteria and viruses that cause acne, strep, influenza, and many other illnesses. In some studies, origanum vulgare outperformed traditional antibiotics and prescription anti-fungal solutions with its capacity to destroy the bacteria, fungi and viruses.\n\nOriganum vulgare's effects can be attributed to 49 phytoelements affecting nine areas of the body. The phytoelements are antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory, with proven effectiveness against MRSA, pseudomonas, staphylococcus, colds, influenza, athlete's foot, candida and internal parasites. Its antiseptic elements provide relief for bites, abrasions and sore throats.

She continues the genre with You've Got Mail, marking her second collaboration with actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear). Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their identities secret (they're known only by screen names \"NY152\" and \"Shopgirl\"), they tell each other everything about their lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into affection for each other. When Joe decides to open a new branch of his \"Foxbooks\" chain that risks putting Kathleen's \"Shop Around the Corner\" out of business, the tension between them escalates. Surely her boutique business will be lost to the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When Joe sees Kathleen waiting for him in the restaurant where they agreed to meet up, he puts two and two together, but cannot face her, given their agreement not to reveal each others' names and professions. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing that he is the cause of her misery? Hopefully, love will conquer all.\n\n\"you've got mail\",\"you've got mail clip\",\"you've got mail part 1\",\"you've got mail soundtrack\",\"you've got mail full movie\",\"you've got mail ending\",\"you've got mail sound\",\"you've got mail scene\",\"tom hanks\",\"meg ryan\",\"romantic comedies\",comedy,\"lauren shuler donner\",\"g mac brown\",\"donald j lee jr\",\"dianne dreyer\",\"nora ephron\",\"julie durk\",\"delia ephron\",\"frustration videos\",\"restaurant videos\",\"joe fox\",\"kathleen kelly\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++174227,/m/0bxtg,/m/0dn3n", "title": "You've Got Mail (1/5) Movie CLIP - Very First Zinger (1998) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-29T19:03:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yX3VPBXQLM", "description": "", "title": "ELECTRONIC DENSIMETER MDS-300 (PART 1): SETTING", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11T08:25:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yXVZ2JEsCo", "description": "Comment nettoyer un siphon?

More videos will be coming soon, so make sure you Subscribe to my channel!\n\nIn this video you will learn how to:\n\n1. Easily Loop Any Region\n\nSimply click on a Midi or Audio track that you want to loop, or select any area (no matter its size), then press CTRL + L. You will notice that the Loop button will turn on, and the selected area will be marked with the Loop brackets. To disable the loop, simply press the Loop button that is now yellow and it will then become grey. \n\n2. Automate the Transposition \n\nPress the small E button from the lower left side of a Midi or Audio track, then select Transposition Modulation and then simply play around with the automation. This way you can create vocal risers, uplifters, downlifters and many other cool effects. \n\nThe vocal used in this example is none other than the one from \u201cEDX \u2013 Cool You Off\u201d. In this track he transposed a female vocal a few octaves down in order to get that deep sound you hear (which seems like a male vocal). \n\n3. Consolidate Small Parts Into Larger Ones\n\nYou can do this with both Audio and Midi files, and it will be very useful when you do the arrangement of a track. Instead of working with tens of small parts, you can have larger files of 8 bars. \n\n4. Group Multiple Tracks\n\nThis feature is useful if you want to add certain effects on similar tracks. For example you can add specific effects to your Kick and Bass, or certain EQ-s and effects to your Highs. Simply select the tracks that you want and then press CTRL + G (or right-click and use the Group Tracks option).\n\nI hope this tutorial was useful.

Banded Leporinus\n\nSeen frequently at shops when small the Banded Leporinus is not a fish for the beginner. Stunning in color, it is a fast grower that has a mean streak to smaller fishes. They are fin nippers that sneaks up on its' prey no matter what size. A super jumper the aquarium must be tightly covered. \n\nCommon name\n\nBanded Leporinus or just Leporinus. \n\nDistribution\n\n      Fairly widespread throughout South America, mostly from the Rio de la Plata to the Orinoco river basins. \n\n\nGeneral Body Form\n\n      Bullet shaped and elongated and somewhat compressed laterally. Dorsal profile is more convex than the ventral profile. The name Leporinus comes from Latin and roughly means \"of a hare \" this is because the shape of the upper lip is very similar to that of a hare, hence its name. These fish can reach a length of twelve inches. \n\n\nColoration\n\n      Mustard-yellow to golden-yellow with nine fairly thick black bars that run from top to bottom that sometimes split at the belly area and fade out on the underside. The nose has a dark spot. The first bar covers the forehead joining the eyes the second bar covers the gill edges. The last bar flares out in front of the Caudal fin into a crescent shape. There are no visible differences between the male and female. Some subspecies have been named due to variations of color and bar patterns. I do not know if they are valid. \n\nMaintenance\n\n      A somewhat peaceful species that benefits from a large aquaria. Its tank-mates should be of the same size and temperament, no long finned slower moving fish such as Angels as they are notoriously sneaky about fin-nipping. The tank bottom should be gravel covered with plants and decorations. Feeding is not a problem as they take prepared staple food along with supplements of live and frozen food.\n      Their pH should be neutral [7.0], GH of around 10, temperature range of mid seventies to low eighties. They dwell in the middle areas of the tank. They are egg layers and to my knowledge have not been bred in captivity. Keep the tank well covered as they are great jumpers and can travel many feet. The Leporinus is a fine addition to any tank and i recommend them to anyone willing to meet their requirements.\n\nBiotope:\n\n      Widespread throughout South America, Usually occurs in rocky areas of rapidly flowing waters.\n\nBreeding:\n\n      No reports of successful breeding in captivity have been reported\n\n\nListed tank sizes are the minimum\nSize:  Up to 12\" (30cm)\nTank:  48 inches\nStrata:  Bottom, middle\nPH:  5.5 to 7.5\nHardness:  Soft to medium. dH range: 2.0 - 20.0\nTemperature:  73\u00b0F to 84\u00b0F (23-29\u00b0C)\n\nOrder:  Crypriniformes.\nSuborder:  Characoidei.\nFamily:  Anostomidae.\nGenera:  Leporinus.", "title": "Fish of the day Ep.11 Banded Leporinus", "publishedDate": "2011-04-01T04:36:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ydOZ5JI-U0", "description": "", "title": "JORIS VOORN vs NIC FANCIULLI & Oriol Torres visuals @ ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL 2013 W2 bayfront stage 2", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T09:19:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ydlXtwh5X8", "description": "Hello marzipans, this was a SUPER requested video so I finally managed to do it.

In 1989 he began development of a transdermal delivery system designed to deliver hormones and nutriceuticals. In 1996, he established \"Market Resource International\" to market these transdermal formulas to the medical community.\n\nPremier Hormone Balance works exclusively with Dr. Borkin to provide your customized solution for hormone balancing and stress-reduction.\n\nPremier Hormone Balance partners with a leading laboratory for salivary analysis of hormones and electrolytes, as well as a manufacturer of advanced custom transdermal remedies. Our \"Evidence-Based Approach\" has proven the efficacy for the use of transdermal hormonal cr\u00e8mes for the treatment of hormonal imbalances and dysfunctions related to stress. Dr. Borkin is also Research Director of the National Institute of Endocrine Research.\n\nIn 2000, Dr. Borkin developed a certification program entitled \"Natural Approaches to Endocrinology,\" which he has taught at campuses throughout the United States.\n\nThe program allows physicians of all disciplines to study Naturopathic Endocrinology and qualifies them to sit for the National Boards. For his professional training programs, Dr. Borkin describes his goal as \"to guide physicians to see their patients with eyes that recognize the core of dysfunction, and not allow symptoms to mislead and misdirect the development of an effective protocol.\"\n\nDr. Borkin is also known for his development of innovative manipulative therapies employed by hundreds of naturopaths, chiropractors and dentists.\n\nIn 1987, he developed Neuro Emotional Sensory Training (NEST), a technique that increases healing capabilities through mind-body integration. Later Dr. Borkin developed Quantum Magnetic Manipulation (Q2M), a three-dimensional technique that utilizes magnetic energy as a means of diagnosing and treating all forms of dysfunction, from its emotional origin to its corresponding musculoskeletal manifestation. In the early 1990s, Dr. Borkin incorporated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) into a system he named Autonomic Equalization (AE), which allows the practitioner to manipulate autonomic activity and normalize sympathetic and parasympathetic activity while using computer verification. \n\nFrom 1993 to 1997, Dr. Borkin was President of the California State Naturopathic Medical Association, a chapter of the American Naturopathic Medical Association.\n\nIn this position he was responsible for the development and implementation of new policies and philosophies including all political activities, educational programs, continuing education, research programs, relicensing seminars and data retrieval efforts.\n\nIn 2002, Dr. Borkin was inducted into the Alternative Medicine Hall of Fame, making him the youngest inductee ever so honored.\nhttp://www.premierhormonebalance.com\n---------\nSalivary Testing\nHormone Testing\nHormone Test Saliva\nMichael Borkin\nDr. Borkin\nDr. Michael Borkin\nBorkin hormones", "title": "Premier Hormone Balance - Dr. Michael Borkin on Salivary Testing", "publishedDate": "2009-11-13T22:53:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yt4p8-g3-c", "description": "Dr. Mathias Kremer, Head of Global Seeds, Bayer CropScience discusses the history of their business.", "title": "Dr Mathias Kremer, Bayer CropScience", "publishedDate": "2013-04-30T20:04:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yt6vI4wIsw", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/Ankara.Oturak.Alemii", "title": "\u00d6mer Faruk Bostan - Aya\u015f G\u00fczeli (2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-05T18:21:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ytrEMkXejk", "description": "Kurdish Peshmerga Humanitarian Aid Assistance Supporting iraqi poor people no matter kurd arab assyrian armenian or turkoman", "title": "Kurdish Peshmerga Helps Iraqi People", "publishedDate": "2010-10-09T13:27:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yu3nXliFCs", "description": "Short video showing the location of \"Mousse\", the first Mercury djinni.\n\nThese in-town djinn aren't too hard to obtain.", "title": "Golden Sun: Dark Dawn Gameplay - Mercury Djinni \"Mousse\" [Part 5]", "publishedDate": "2010-10-28T04:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "8yuPGwxwdPs", "description": "How to make the World's most expensive Christmas card at home.

As the pilots close in on the target, they release a hellfire missile. The targets can be seen as little white spots in the middle of the road.

A positive diagnosis generally requires observing specific macroscopic and microscopic changes. The normal squamous epithelium lining of the esophagus is replaced by metaplastic columnar and goblet cells. Columnar epithelium refers to a cell type that is typically found in more distal parts of the gastrointestinal system. Only the presence of goblet cells equates a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. The medical significance of Barrett esophagus is its strong association with esophageal adenocarcinoma, a particularly lethal cancer.\n\nThe main cause of Barrett esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis. In the last 4 years, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been increasing in the Western world. Barrett esophagus is found in 5--15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett esophagus do not have symptoms. It is considered to be a premalignant condition because it is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer (more specifically, adenocarcinoma) of about 0.5% per patient-year. If the cancer develops, it is very often deadly.\n\n Diagnosis of Barrett esophagus requires endoscopy (more specifically, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a procedure in which a fibre optic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: non-dysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma can be treated by endoscopic resection and new endoscopic therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, whereas advanced stages (submucosal)are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment. Non-dysplastic and low-grade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy, with radiofrequency ablation as a therapeutic option. In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.\n\nThe condition is named after Norman Barrett (1903--1979) who described the condition in 1950.\n\nBoth macroscopic (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive findings are required to make a diagnosis. Barrett esophagus is marked by the presence of columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal squamous cell epithelium\u2014an example of metaplasia. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe presence of goblet cells, called intestinal metaplasia, is necessary to make a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. This frequently occurs in the presence of other metaplastic columnar cells but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic.\n\nThe metaplasia of Barrett esophagus is grossly visible through a gastroscope, but biopsy specimens must be examined under a microscope to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature. Colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding goblet cells in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis of Barrett.\n\nThere are many histologic mimics of Barrett esophagus (i.e. goblet cells occurring in the transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, \"pseudogoblet cells\" in which abundant foveolar (gastric) type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells). Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia). Use of the histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics. Recently, immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been utilized to identify true intestinal-type metaplastic cells. It has been shown that the protein AGR2 is elevated in Barrett esophagus, and can be used as a biomarker for distinguishing Barrett epithelium from normal esophageal epithelium.", "title": "Endoscopy of Barrett Esophagus", "publishedDate": "2010-08-30T03:15:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zTylarDEEY", "description": "From the album Waikiki", "title": "Fluf Class action", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T13:35:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zU8GMFWZCQ", "description": "CHECK OUT OUR FACEBOOK PAGE!\nwww.facebook.com/voiceofcontention\n\nHit the \"like\" button if you like what you hear/see.\n\nCheck out our youtube channel for more videos!\n\nGuitar: ESP NT-7\nAmp: Maxon OD808 - Peavey 5150 - ENGL 2X12 Cab\n\nMUSIC/LYRICS BY: VOICE OF CONTENTION\nVIDEO BY: ERIK KARLSSON", "title": "Voice of Contention - Emptiness (OFFICIAL PLAYTHROUGH)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T21:21:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zUY4udoLgc", "description": "This is a reworking of my rapidstryfe.

In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add a certain amount of water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. \"Blended cements\" and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.\n\n 1.BOILER FOR POWER STATION. 2.BOILER FOR CHEMICAL,REFINERY ,PETROCHEMICAL PLANT. 3.BOILER FOR CEMENT PLANT. 4.BOILER FOR PAPER PLANT. 5.BOILER FOR FOOD FABRICATING FACOTRY. 6.STEEL MILL,METALLUGERY MILL ect2.FUEL KINDS.

This gives you some idea how  \nSparsely populated the rest of the state  is. \n despite it's small size by lower 48 standards, \nAnchorage has its share of city husle and bustle.  \nThe city of anchorage dates  back to the late 19th \nCentury when it was a tent city for gold miners and fur trappers.  \n   fur  trapping is still a major industry in alaska,  \nAnd anchorage is the central marketplace for some \nOf the most exotic and high quality furs in the world. \nThe fur rendezvous celebration that takes   place \nIn anchorage each winter , has been called the \n\"mardi gras of the north\" .  It  evolved from  a gathering\n of fur trappers to a rip-roaring celebration which \nFeatures such delightful events as outhouse and canoe races. \nIn addition to furs, anchorage   offers   unique opportunities \nTo buy native art  and craft items from throughout the state.  \nTo the alaskan native, art was, and is a way of life. \n every object used in the  routines of daily life \nWas turned into an object of art.\nScrimshaw, ceremonial  masks, and ivory carvings \nAre but a few of the art forms   available in these shops.\n\nThere's no shortage of things to do in anchorage. \nFor the more adventuruos spirit, an evening ballon ride\nProvides  an unforgetable experience. \n(there are several commercial balloon ride concessions\n offering these rides to visitors, and the sky above\n anchorage is dotted with these colorful forms drifting \nSilently across the sky almost every evening during the \nSummer months. \"", "title": "Alaska Travel Guide: Anchorage", "publishedDate": "2011-06-30T05:34:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zb-QZKk-8M", "description": "My Nopalea testimonial.", "title": "Nopalea Testimonial", "publishedDate": "2013-01-12T17:30:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zb6Jw97BhA", "description": "Overview of quantitative finance major at James Madison University", "title": "Ed Andrews Quantitative Finance Major.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-12-05T20:17:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zb9ev_8uNM", "description": "", "title": "mako mako mako mako mako  genovaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...divertimento assicurato", "publishedDate": "2013-07-12T19:56:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zbJCa2yk_I", "description": "", "title": "A Demonstration of the Gnome Male Worker for iClone 3D by Mr. Necturus", "publishedDate": "2014-06-12T23:52:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zbOLL5dC1E", "description": "Lobster Diving/Hunting from our kayaks for California Spiny Lobster (aka bugs) with my wife.

Along with the other three, Reed was exposed to cosmic radiation, resulting in his ability to stretch any part of his body to any length or shape.\n\nReed Richards has earned his multiple Ph.D.s in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering. He is also working as a military scientist.\n\nLEGO Marvel Super Heroes\n\nAfter the battle at Grand Central Station between The Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Sandman, and the Abomination, Nick Fury told Agent Coulson to make sure one of the cosmic bricks made it the Fantastic Four for study.\n\nMister Fantastic teamed up with Captain America to defend Baxter Building from Doc Ock, nearly destroying the lab. The fight spilled onto The Daily Bugle and Times Square, where Spider-Man joined the fight. After Ock was defeated, Green Goblin took the brick to Oscorp. \n\nThe Fantastic Four is an internationally-renowned group of superhuman champions (often dubbed the world's premiere super hero team or the first family of super heroes) based in New York City and dedicated to the betterment of the world through scientific discovery and defense against evil.\n\nIt all started with a rushed test flight of an experimental spacecraft. Years before, while a student at Empire State University, Reed Richards began working on plans for one of the first vehicles capable interstellar travel. His roommate and best friend, Benjamin Grimm, jokingly promised to pilot the craft. But Reed, after studying to be an aeronautical engineer, finally realized his lifelong dream. Exhausting the majority of his vast inheritance, he funded the construction and launch of such a starship. Other financers, particularly the U.S. government, however, were losing interest and they threatened to cut him off from their funding of the project. Reed embarked on an immediate test flight, taking Ben Grimm with him who had become a successful Air Force pilot. Reed's longtime sweetheart and fianc\u00e9e, Susan Storm, and her brother, Johnny, also joined them. Ben opposed the idea, warning that the ship's shielding might prove inadequate against intense forms of cosmic radiation. Nevertheless, Reed persuaded them all to accompany him, stealing into the launch facility, boarding the starship, and blasting off in pursuit of scientific glory. They intended to travel to another star system and back, but a solar flare temporarily boosted the intensity of the ionizing radiation in Earth's Van Allen belt.\n\nThe spaceship encountered a bombardment of cosmic radiation, causing both the mission to be aborted and the craft to crash. Emerging from the ruins of the spaceship, they discovered the radiation had mutated their bodies. Reed gained the ability to stretch his body and limbs, Johnny was able to fly and become engulfed in flame, and Sue was able to bend light around her body and become invisible. Ben, on the other hand, gained incredible strength and durability at the cost of being severely disfigured. All four decided to use their powers to better humanity and founded the Fantastic Four.\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!", "title": "LEGO Fantastic Four vs Thor KnockOff Minifigures (Bootleg)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T01:08:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8zyNT-mFDV4", "description": "Brought to you to by http://www.innersoultechnologies.com\nIt is extremely powerful, and many people cannot handle the energy field that radiates from it!

Ingredients in the formula work together to support optimal nitric oxide levels in the body. Nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels to enable optimal blood flow. Efficient blood flow is crucial for healthy male sexual activity and overall vascular health. Icariin, a flavonoid extracted from epimedium, may selectively inhibit phosphodiesterase type V (PDE-5), an enzyme that causes the male sexual response to subside. By blocking this enzyme, sustained activity may be promoted.

Making use of the exact same ingredients as discovered in youthful skin, Hyaluronic Acid Serum is absorbed easily and attracts moisture from the environment. Good 4 Life's anti-aging solution consists of additional beneficial ingredients like Vitamins C and E to help heal and bring back glowing skin.\n\nHi i'm Lacie and I just wanted to make a video for my favorite product in the world and it's called hyaluronic acid serum. So my skin last year was just really tired and dull and also I'm trying to prevent wrinkles. I know it's very important to prevent wrinkles at a young age but also if you're older you know you need a product that is good at getting rid of your wrinkles. So hyaluroinc acid serum is a great product. It makes my skin look so flawless, prevents wrinkles, and my skin went from looking really tired and dull to being very glowy and soft so make sure you check it out and you can get it from Amazon. Bye everybody.\n\nDry skin is a problem that has an effect on individuals of any ages, however as we age our skin slowly loses some of its natural hydrating power. Hyaluronic Acid is discovered in younger skin and pulls moisture from the environment to keep skin supple and wrinkle-free. However until recently, existing solutions consisted of severe ingredients like alcohol, that end up combating many of the benefits of the serum. \n\nA brand-new Hyaluronic Acid Serum developed by Good 4 Life changes all of that. Rather than severe chemicals, Hyaluronic Acid is combined with natural and advantageous ingredients, such as Vitamin C, that compliment the natural recovery assets of the serum. Vitamin E offers beneficial antioxidant results and Lavender Oil helps to promote recovery and has an anti-inflammatory result. All of these and others combine to make best use of the benefits of this serum.", "title": "Allie's Hyaluronic Acid Serum How To", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T10:19:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9-3KTj3vpKg", "description": "A fan music video for Cat mouse Cat.\nWanted to make a fan looking concept music video for the actual video.\n http://www.myspace.com/catmousecat\n\nTherein lies the point.

On the other hand if jazaak were to be written in Arabic, it would be unclear who the writer is referring to, is it a male or a female? Also, Allaah should be said as Allaahu. This is due to grammatical reasons, where the \ufffdu\ufffd displays the doer (the one who will be rewarding), i.e. Allaah (swt).\n\nJazaak comes from the root word jazaa\ufffd which according to the popular Arabic-English dictionary, Al-Mawrid, has two meanings that are completely opposite to eachother!\n\nThus jazaa\ufffd can either mean reward/requital OR punishment/sanction. For an even more accurate reference, one just has to turn back to the Qur\ufffdaan and see how Allaah (swt) uses the word jazaa\ufffd regarding the reward for the believers and the punishment for the disbelievers in the Day of Judgment, may Allaah (swt) save us from that, aameen.\n\nJazaak literally means \ufffdMay he reward\ufffd in a requesting sense. Thus the person saying that is making du\ufffdaa. Obviously du\ufffdaa can only be made to Allaah. That is why Allaah is immediately mentioned after jazaak, for He is the only one who can reward with good or bad.\n\nIf you were to say to someone: \ufffdJazaak Allaah\ufffd, the person would, in almost all cases, think that you are asking Allaah to reward him/her with good. This is the case with an Arab as well. But if you were to pay attention closely to what you are saying, you will see that you are not emphasizing what you would want Allaah to reward that person with. Imagine a person that is very angry at someone, telling him: \ufffdJazaak Allah sharran!\ufffd (May Allaah reward you with bad!). Although that is a very unlikely situation in shaa Allaah, it still shows us the importance of always being clear with our words and speech with other people, in order to prevent any misunderstandings.\n\nThus, what follows is the correct way of saying \ufffdMay Allaah reward you with good\ufffd in different grammatical forms, i.e. to a man, woman, group etc.:\n\n\nTo a male: Jazaak Allaahu khayran\nTo a female: Jazaaki-llaahu khayran\n\nTo two people (whether male/female): Jazaakuma Allaahu khayran\n\nTo three men or more: Jazaakum Allaahu khayran\nTo three women or more: Jazaakumunna-llaahu khayran\n\nIn the case of a group of people, with only one man but many women, one must use \ufffdJazaakum Allaahu khayran\ufffd (i.e. that which is used to three or more men). That is just how the Arabic grammar is.\n\nWhen speaking about people that are not present, but invocating Allaah (swt) to reward them with good, the following is the correct way to make du\ufffdaa for them:\n\nTo one man: Jazaahu-llaahu khayran\nTo one woman: Jazaaha-llaahu khayran\n\nTo two people: Jazaahuma Allaahu khayran\n\nTo three men or more: Jazaahum Allaahu khayran\nTo three women or more: Jazaahunna Allaahu khayran\n\nIn the case of a group of people, that has only one man but many women, one must use \ufffdJazaahum Allaahu khayran\ufffd (i.e. that which is used to three or more men).\n\nYou may also like to add more emphasis to the goodness that you want Allaah swt to reward the person with. For example, after khayran you can say \ufffdkatheeran\ufffd (plenty/abundant/many).\n\nAlternatively, you could say after Allaahu \ufffdkhayrul-jazaa\ufffd\ufffd, which literally means \ufffdthe best of rewarding\ufffd; thus when said altogether: \ufffdMay Allaah reward you with the best (type) of rewarding\ufffd.\n\nThe Sunnah way to respond to someone saying Jazaak Allaah, is to say: \ufffdJazaana wa iyaakum\ufffd (may Allaah reward us and you). For a shorter version, one can say \ufffdwa iyaakum\ufffd (and you).\n\nThis concludes the topic at hand in shaa Allaah. Whatever good that has been written\ufffd is from Allaah. And whatever bad or mistake has occurred therein, is from me and Shaytaan.\n\nAssalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu.", "title": "Say \"Jazak'Allaahu khayran/khayr\" Not \"Jazak'Allaah\"", "publishedDate": "2011-12-10T20:48:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9-HTTFEk6UM", "description": "What are the dumbest ways to die in video games?

The restless baby Langur does not stay still and is constantly moving around in awe of its surroundings.\n\nGray langurs or Hanuman langurs, the most widespread langurs of South Asia, are a group of Old World monkeys constituting the entirety of the genus Semnopithecus. All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus.  In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\nUttarakhand has a great diversity of flora and fauna. It has a recorded forest area of 34651 km2 which constitutes 65% of the total area of the state. Uttarakhand is home to rare species of plants and animals, many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves. National parks in Uttarakhand include the Jim Corbett National Park (the oldest national park of India) at Ramnagar in Nainital District, and Valley of Flowers National Park and Nanda Devi National Park in Chamoli District, which together are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A number of plant species in the valley are internationally threatened, including several that have not been recorded from elsewhere in Uttarakhand. Rajaji National Park in Haridwar District and Govind Pashu Vihar National Park and Sanctuary and Gangotri National Park in Uttarkashi District are some other protected areas in the state.\n\nLeopards are found in areas which are abundant in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, ghoral (goat-antelopes), Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants can be seen in herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), Brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) are found in the rivers. Butterflies and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), Jungle Babbler, Tawny-bellied Babbler, Great Slaty Woodpecker, Red-breasted Parakeet, Orange-breasted Green Pigeon and Chestnut-winged Cuckoo.\n\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Regular Milk - as part of the expert series by GeoBeats.\n \nWhen it comes to milk, it can be hard to figure out which product to use. There are pros and cons to both soy milk and regular milk. If you do not digest dairy well, then of course you are not going to want to drink a cows' milk. However soy milk is a highly processed product, so you want to be careful to type of soy milk that you get. You want to make sure that the soy beans that are making the milk are not genetically modified, there is a huge big deal when it comes to buying soy in the US. \n\nI also like some of the other milk alternatives, like almond milk, hemp milk, rice milk, some of the other milks that are a little less processed than soy. However for some people, doing a cows' milk is important because they need more vitamin D and they also need more calcium from actual cows' milk. So when you are buying cows' milk, main thing you want to do is make sure that it is organic. You do not want to be digesting the hormones and the antibiotics that are often fed to cows these days in big dairy farms to keep them healthy. \n\nIt really depends on your body, which type of milk is right for you. But in general, I encourage my clients to get their nutrition from fruits, vegetables, grains and good healthy fats, as well as some good protein whether that is animal or non. And let the milk be a little side item that you have every once in a while.", "title": "Soy Milk or Regular Milk?

On Friday evening, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the main organizers \n\nof the protests, postponed a planned dialogue with city officials, arguing that police had \n\nfailed to protect students from violence.\n\nMarvest Chan, 24, was among the students sent running from streets he had occupied in the \n\nMong Kok neighborhood. Demonstrators report that around 2 p.m. several hundred people \n\nopposed to the pro-democracy group descended on their encampment, destroying tents, pelting \n\nthem with full water bottles and threatening the students.\n\n\"When I was hit by the bottle, the police didn\u2019t stop them or even give them a warning,\u201d \n\nChan said. The men opposing the demonstrations \"were telling the girls that if they stay \n\nhere they should be prepared to be sexually harassed,\u201d he said.\nmong kok showdown\n\nOccupy demonstrators hold their line in Mong Kok during a face-off with anti-occupy forces \n\nthat had earlier driven them from the area. (Matt Sheehan)\n\nStudent-led demonstrations are demanding an end to mainland China's role in approving \n\ncandidates in local Hong Kong elections, with tens of thousands of dedicated participants \n\npeacefully occupying roads and sleeping on concrete throughout several main swaths of the \n\ncity.\n\nBut today at a main shopping drag in occupied Causeway Bay, verbal arguments turned \n\nphysical, with one man using the handle of an umbrella to strike another man's face, \n\nsullying the very symbol of peaceful resistance that demonstrators have adopted. With \n\nsimilar scenes unfolding at several locations in the city, demonstrators blamed the \n\nviolence on paid instigators who they claim were sent to disrupt the largely peaceful \n\nprotests. Students have pledged to avoid violence in confrontations.\n\nAs night fell on Friday, massive crowds on both sides faced off in the Mong Kok \n\nneighborhood, with police struggling to maintain order near the divide between the two \n\ncamps. Student demonstrators jeered their opponents, chanting \"You're off work!\" in \n\nreference to rumors that anti-occupy individuals were being paid for their presence.\n\n    Hong Kong Leader's Warning Renews Protesters' Zeal as ...\nHong Kong pro-democracy protests enter second week\nDefiant Hong Kong demonstrators face threat of police ...\nHong Kong protests persist after ultimatum, mob attacks ...\nDeadline looms for Hong Kong protesters to clear streets ...\nHong Kong protesters stage massive, defiant rally \nHong Kong Protesters Defy Leader's Warning To Clear Streets\nDefiant Hong Kong demonstrators face threat of police ...\nhong kong protests 2014\n\nhong kong protests 2013\n\nhong kong protests nsa\n\nhong kong protest to focus ire on leader\n\nhong kong protest july 1st 2013\n\nhong kong protest 1 july\n\nhong kong protest bbc\n\nhong kong protest colonial flag\n\nhong kong protest today\n Hong Kong Protests, Democracy Protests, China Mong Kok Violence, Hong Kong Protests , Hong \n\nKong Protests, Mong Kok Triads, Hong Kong Subway Brawl ,Fight Hong Kong Occupy ,Hong Kong \n\nMong Kok Mong, Kok Protests Hong Kong, Violence Hong Kong, Video, Hong Kong Democracy,", "title": "Watch: Hong Kong Subway Brawl During Occupy Protests", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T07:24:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9-NTMuNlqpQ", "description": "Music video by Natasha St-Pier performing 1, 2, 3.

The glands (normally the size of a pea) provide moisture for the vulva area. A Bartholin's gland cyst may form in the gland itself or in the duct draining the gland. A cyst normally does not cause pain, grows slowly, and may go away without treatment. It usually ranges in size from 0.4-1.2 in. (1-3 cm), although some may grow much larger.\nIf infected, a Bartholin's gland cyst can form an abscess that will increase in size over several days and is very painful. In order to heal, a Bartholin's gland cyst usually must be drained.\n\nOther video ideas might include comedones, clogged pores, rosacea, blemish, akne, dermabrasion, and pore strips, Don't forget to consider searching roacutane, acnezine, rosacea treatment, pores, blemish extractor, black head treatment!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/asboxoffice\n\nProtect yourself from the sun\n\nOne of the most important ways to take care of your skin is to protect it from the sun.

Dick, this science fiction-thriller reflects the writer's familiar preoccupation with themes of concealed identity and mind control. Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a Washington, D.C. detective in the year 2054. Anderton works for \"Precrime,\" a special unit of the police department that arrests murderers before they have committed the actual crime. Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who hired a team of futurists to devise the film's numerous technologically advanced gadgets, Minority Report co-stars Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Neal McDonough.\n\n\"minority report\",\"minority report clip\",\"minority report part 1\",\"minority report full movie\",\"tom cruise\",\"neal mcdonough\",\"steven spielberg\",\"robot videos\",\"tub videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"walter f parkes\",\"gerald r molen\",\"michael doven\",\"jan de bont\",\"ronald shusett\",\"gary goldman\",\"fear videos\",\"survival videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262610,/m/07r1h,/m/03w4sh", "title": "Minority Report (4/9) Movie CLIP - Spider Robots (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T23:36:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "902G4nhqNcI", "description": "View this Listing:\nhttp://seasidepropertiesgroup.com/residence-1902-for-sale-l-hermitage-fort-lauderdale-luxury-oceanfront-condos-33308\n\nThis fantastic 3 Bedroom, 2.5 baths flow-through residence offers direct ocean & city views.

It is a spin-off of the Saint Seiya anime series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada, produced in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the franchise. The series began broadcasting in Japan on TV Asahi on April 1, 2012. It is directed by Morio Hatano (his debut as series director), with animation character designs by illustrator and animator Yoshihiko Umakoshi, known for performing the same duties on Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, HeartCatch PreCure! and Casshern Sins.\n\nThe series follows a young teenager known as Koga who becomes one of the 88 warriors protecting the Goddess Athena known as Saints. As the Pegasus Bronze Saint, Koga embarks on a journey to increase his power to save Athena while meeting some other Saints. For the second season, the series tells the conflict between Athena and her sister Pallas which starts a new war. The series also got a manga adaptation and a fighting game.\n\nOmega was created as an alternative to the series' direct sequel Saint Seiya: Next Dimension due to lack of material to adapt. As a result, rather than refocusing on the returning cast, Toei created a new generation of Saint who would succeed the old cast. Critical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre.\n\nThe storyline of Omega takes place 25 years after the Holy Wars of the 20th century narrated in the original manga and its anime adaptation. The goddess Athena is still on Earth after reincarnating to continue her duty of protecting peace against several antagonistic deities. Athena and a new generation of Saints prepare to face new threats that lurks in this new era, in which Pegasus Seiya, the protagonist of Kurumada's manga, is revered as a Saint of legend and one of Athena's Gold Saints.\n\nThe first part of the series is the \"Mars Saga\" (\u30de\u30eb\u30b9\u7de8 Marusu Hen), introducing the new Pegasus Saint Koga and his friends Dragon Ryuhou, Lionet Souma, Wolf Haruto, Aquila Yuna, Orion Eden, and Aria and the beginning of their fight against the God of War Mars in his quest to capture Aria to become the new Athena. The second part is the \"Zodiac Temples Saga\" (\u5341\u4e8c\u5bae\u7de8 J\u016bniky\u016b Hen), featuring Koga and his friends fight against the many Gold Saints who have aligned themselves with Mars in their fight to save Athena before it is too late.\n\nThe second season begins the \"New Cloth Saga\" (\u65b0\u751f\u8056\u8863\uff08\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\uff09\u7de8 Ny\u016b Kurosu Hen), introducing Athena's new enemy Pallas and her Pallasite warriors, a new ally in the Steel Saint Subaru, and new powers with their stronger New Cloths. The second half of season 2 comprises the \"Omega Awakens Saga\" (\u03a9\u899a\u9192\u7de8 Omega Kakusei Hen), where Athena and her many Saints take their war with Pallas to her stronghold Pallasvelda, where Pallas's elite Pallasites begin to conspire against her.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that the Omega animated series would be adapted to manga form, and it started serialization on March 26, 2013, in Kadokawa Shoten's Kerokero Ace magazine. The comic book contains the arcs of the first season and it also adapted the second season. Its only tank\u014dbon volume was released on September 23, 2013.\n\nAs an installment separate from Kurumada's work, the series will introduce characters new to the Saint Seiya fictional universe, that will make use of elements already established within it. Some of them, such as the deities, exist in the original manga. Additionally, known elements from Saint Seiya, such as the Cloths, the armors worn by the Saints, bear their known constellations, but are presented in Omega with a new design that differs substantially from those in the original source material, and departing from it, the Cloths emerge from jewels worn by the characters to envelop their bodies, which are known in Omega as ClothStones (\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3 Kurosut\u014dn).\n\nThe Cosmo essence, one of the basic concepts of Saint Seiya, is expanded in Omega with the addition of specific elemental properties: Fire (\u706b Hi), Wind (\u98a8 Kaze), Thunder (\u96f7 Kaminari), Earth (\u571f Tsuchi), Water (\u6c34 Mizu), Darkness (\u95c7 Yami) and Light (\u5149 Hikari).", "title": "Saint Seiya Omega OST Soundtrack \u4e0d\u5b89\u306a\u4e88\u611f", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T20:53:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "903bpyD4FbA", "description": "Mrs Charmaine Harrison (Vascular Sonographer, The Whiteley Clinic, UK) uses ultrasound to mark an Anterior Accessory Saphenous Vein (AASV - Formerly The LTV) ready for endovenous surgery.\n\nMore videos and information regarding varicose veins and related conditions are available at www.collegeofphlebology.com", "title": "Preoperative marking of Anterior Accessory Saphenous Vein (AASV)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-14T10:46:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "903joNo4U_A", "description": "This is an update from the previous formula.

Dental Health and Hygiene\nAloe Vera is extremely healthful for your mouth and gums. Take that to your next dentist appointment! \n\n9. Provides Rapid Soothing \nAloe Vera enhances fibroblast function. Fibroblast are those remarkable little cells responsible for collagen formation. They also assist in the soothing of minor burns, cuts, scrapes, sunburn, and skin irritations. \n\n8.Aids in Healthy Digestion \nA healthy digestive tract ensures that nutrients from the foods we eat are absorbed into the blood stream. Aloe Vera Juice has natural, detoxifying abilities. Drinking Aloe Vera Juice made from the pure aloe gel regularly may improve bowel regularity and increase protein absorption, while at the same time decrease unfriendly bacteria and yeast all done naturally! Aloe Vera has also demonstrated its ability to assist in soothing heartburn and other types of digestive upset.\n\n7. Immune Support and Function \nAloe Vera provides natural support for the immune system. Since the immune system works around the clock protecting the body, aloe vera, with its natural immune enhancers, gives the body a continual arsenal from which to draw. Drinking 2 to 4 ounces of Aloe Vera Gel regularly may give your immune system the helping hand it needs.\n6. Regulates Weight and Energy Levels \nAloe Vera Gel naturally, and with regular use, allows the body to cleanse the digestive system. Our diets include many unwanted substances which can cause lethargy and exhaustion. Taken regularly, Aloe Vera Juice from the pure aloe gel ensures a greater feeling of well-being, allowing energy levels to increase and helping to maintain a healthy body weight. \n\n5. Collagen and Elastin Repair \nAloe Vera can add a rich supply of building materials to produce and maintain healthy skin. The skin replenishes itself every 21 to 28 days. Using the nutritional building blocks of aloe vera, the skin can utilize these nutrients daily to help combat the effects of aging! A daily dose of Aloe Vera Juice made from pure aloe vera gel can be just what your skin is thirsting for.\n\n4. Daily Dose of Minerals \nSome of the minerals found in aloe vera include calcium, sodium, iron, potassium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, copper, and zinc. What a powerful storehouse! We all know that adding foods to our diets with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals is recommended for overall health. Drinking Aloe Vera Gel is a natural and healthful way to replenish the body's supply. \n\n3. Daily Dose of Vitamins \nAloe Vera Gel includes Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C and E, Folic Acid and Niacin. The human body simply cannot store some of these vitamins; therefore we need to supplement them regularly through our diets. What better way than by drinking a daily dose of Aloe Vera Juice, made from pure Aloe Vera Gel, while at the same time building the body's defense system naturally against oxidative stress! \n\n2. Anti-inflammatory Properties\nAloe Vera Gel has 12 natural substances that have been shown to inhibit inflammation without side effects. Aloe may also support proper joint and muscle mobility. \n\n\n1. Body-Building Blocks\nAmino acids are our body's building blocks. Eight which are essential and cannot be made by the body are found within the aloe plant! Drinking Aloe Vera Juice on a regular basis allows you to help maintain your health by replenishing your body naturally with these essential amino acids. An analysis of the aloe vera plant shows that it comes closer than any other known plant to the duplication of essential amino acids.

One source calls them Falaco solitons. Basically the surface of the water appears to have two opposing vortices stuck near to each other. What you can't see under the surface is basically half of a ring vortex like a smoke ring or something, which keeps the surface vortices from moving away from each other. This is caused when the circular disk (ceramic plate) is dragged through the water. The water in front of the plate is pushed forward, while the water to the sides of the plate stays where it is. At the boundary between these two relative flows there is a sheering force, a curl, which manifests as rotation of the little parcels of water in the area. So this invisible smiley face part of the vortex connects the two surface features in a single 3 dimensional soliton. The appearance of two separate features in both the 2-d surface of the water and the 2-d projection at the bottom of the pool is really neat in my view.

Kitman Ho, Arnold Kopelson\nScreenwriter: Oliver Stone\nFilm Description: Oliver Stone's breakthrough as a director, Platoon is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam, where he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers under two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul, and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both personal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks \"in country,\" Taylor begins to see the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his views of the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves into a round of murder and rape. Unlike Hollywood's first wave of Vietnam movies (including The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Coming Home), Platoon is a grunt's-eye view of the war, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the battles and suffered the wounds. In this sense, it resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers, as it mixes familiar elements of onscreen battle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion, C-rations, marijuana, and counting the days before you go home. This mix of traditional war movie elements with a contemporary sensibility won Platoon four Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, and a reputation as one of the definitive modern war films.\n\nplatoon,\"platoon clip\",\"platoon full movie\",\"platoon soundtrack\",\"sgt elias\",drama,\"conflict videos\",\"hatred videos\",lerner,\"ethics videos\",\"mark moses\",\"lt wolfe\",\"john c mcginley\",\"willem dafoe\",\"village videos\",\"gun videos\",blockbusters,\"20th century period pieces\",\"a kitman ho\",\"rivalry videos\",\"war videos\",\"values videos\",\"johnny depp\",\"vietnam videos\",\"tom berenger\",\"oliver stone\",\"sgt barnes\",\"sgt oneill\",\"charlie sheen\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++38327,/m/021npv", "title": "Platoon (3/10) Movie CLIP - Elias Fights Barnes (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T02:13:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "90B9GopNxbA", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "stater anak durian", "publishedDate": "2012-09-20T06:06:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "90BEKhetNYs", "description": "Alabama RB Trent Richardson shows off his impeccable footwork against Ole Miss.", "title": "Trent Richardson Cooks Ole Miss with a Shake and Bake - #tbt", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T14:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "90BRr_GHKA8", "description": "test camera on board a zxr400", "title": "zxr 400 gas station ride", "publishedDate": "2007-02-05T10:55:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "90BnMxYzvg8", "description": "CrossFit -- (http://www.crossfit.com)\n\nNicole Carroll, CrossFit Director of Training, talks with Sevan Matossian.", "title": "Sub 3 Minutes with Nicole Carroll", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T07:24:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "90CB_rwja-E", "description": "Watch Nancy Zieman with guest Laura Wasilowski demonstrate the Fusible Tiling technique.\nhttp://www.nancysnotions.com/product/art+quilts+fusible+collage+workshop+workbook.do?extid=YT00044", "title": "Art Quilts - Fusible Collage Workshop (Tiling Collage)", "publishedDate": "2011-09-06T16:41:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "90CLCsl65lw", "description": "Vulgariser le fabuleux th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Kurt Goedel/ Extrait-1", "title": "Vulgariser le fabuleux th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Kurt Goedel/ Extrait-1", "publishedDate": "2012-02-21T00:06:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "90CN6MICfWA", "description": "Nick Clegg labelled Alex Salmond's decision to wave a Saltire behind David Cameron at Wimbledon as \"a bit crass\".\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister told Call Clegg that he turned down a ticket to join them in the Royal Box at Wimbledon as he wanted to watch the match with his son.", "title": "Alex Salmond's Saltire Stunt 'A Bit Crass' Says Clegg", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T09:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "90CPq7P0iB8", "description": "\u0420\u044b\u0431\u043a\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u043e, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0420\u044b\u0431\u044b-\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0443\u043d\u044b. \u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 - \u0410\u043c\u0444\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b (Amphiprion) - \u0440\u043e\u0434 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u044b\u0431 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435.", "title": "\u0420\u044b\u0431\u044b-\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0443\u043d\u044b, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0410\u043c\u0444\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b (Amphiprion)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T22:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "90CTSomGNlw", "description": "\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2591\u2591\u2591 LEIA A DESCRI\u00c7\u00c3O DO V\u00cdDEO \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2593\u2593\u2593\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\u25cf Gostou?\n\u25cf Clique no gostei\n\u25cf Se \u00e9 novo, inscreva-se\n\u25cf Favorite o v\u00eddeo\n\u25cf Divulgue para seus amigos!\n\u25cf Comente!\n\u25cf Guidetti: http://www.youtube.com/user/Guittsg\n\u25cf Leppy: http://www.youtube.com/user/leppyable\n\u25cf Spector: http://www.youtube.com/user/SpectorGame\n\u25cf Golpe: http://www.youtube.com/user/GolpeGamer\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac", "title": "Tretas no HG ft.

Corporal Bryon Dickson was killed in the shooting ambush, while Alex Douglass was critically injured, and has since been released from hospital.\n\nFrein\u2019s capture comes after a 48-day manhunt for the suspect, whose has been described as an excellent marksman and a survivalist familiar with the mountain range area near where his parents live.\n\nAuthorities first linked Frein to the shooting three days after the incident, when a man walking his dog came across Frein\u2019s car that was half submerged in a swamp few miles from the shooting scene. Inside, officials found shell casings, Frein\u2019s driver\u2019s license, camouflage face paint, two empty rifle cases and military gear.\n\nOfficials also monitored a call Frein made from his cell phone to his parents\u2019 home, tracing the call to a location about 3 miles away. Authorities said they had spotted Frein several times throughout the 7-week search, but he was always able to evade capture in the rugged terrain.\n\nDuring the hunt, police came across several items they believe belonged to Frein, including two functional pipe bombs, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, soiled diapers, an AK-47-style assault rifle, ammunition and a journal.\n\nA U.S. Army manual called \u201cSniper Training and Employment\u201d was also found in Frein\u2019s bedroom at his parents\u2019 home.\n\nReports say law enforcement found Frein in an airport hangar at the former Birchwood Resort in the Pocono Mountains, roughly 20 miles southwest of where the initial shootings took place. He was reportedly armed with two guns, but officials said he surrendered peacefully and was arrested without incident.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

I had not been sad in his presence before, 2 so the king asked me, \u201cWhy does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.\u201d\n\nI was very much afraid, 3 but I said to the king, \u201cMay the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?\u201d\n\n4 The king said to me, \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d\n\nThen I prayed to the God of heaven, 5 and I answered the king, \u201cIf it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.\u201d\n\n6 Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, \u201cHow long will your journey take, and when will you get back?\u201d It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.\n\n7 I also said to him, \u201cIf it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? 8 And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?\u201d And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. 9 So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king\u2019s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.\n\n10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.\nNehemiah Inspects Jerusalem\u2019s Walls\n\n11 I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days 12 I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.\n\n13 By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal[a] Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. 14 Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King\u2019s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through; 15 so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate. 16 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.\n\n17 Then I said to them, \u201cYou see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.\u201d 18 I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me.\n\nThey replied, \u201cLet us start rebuilding.\u201d So they began this good work.\n\n19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. \u201cWhat is this you are doing?\u201d they asked. \u201cAre you rebelling against the king?\u201d\n\n20 I answered them by saying, \u201cThe God of heaven will give us success.

He was armed with two high-powered rifles, a crossbow and a knife, Canadian television station Global News reported. \nPolice received a call reporting a sighting of a man in camouflage at 7:20 p.m. A gunfight ensued between the police and Bourque. Vanessa Bernatchez, a resident of Moncton,  told CBS that the police did not know the location of the shooter until he opened fire.\nThe gunfight resulted in the deaths of three policemen. Two others were also wounded, but the injuries were said to be non life-threatening. \nThe police have blocked off a number of roads in Moncton as they continue to search for him. A police helicopter has also been dispatched to help hunt for Bourque.\nBourque is still believed to be in the Pinehurst subdivision area of the city, but so far the manhunt has yielded no results.\nPolice from across New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island were deployed to assist in the manhunt. \nSuch violence is rare in Canada. The last attack on Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers dates back to 2005, where four policemen were killed by a gunman on a farm in Alberta.", "title": "Moncton shooting: Police hunt for Justin Bourque who kills", "publishedDate": "2014-07-04T16:13:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "90HD2EwyL2o", "description": "July 20, 2014", "title": "Western Meadowlark; Sturnella neglecta", "publishedDate": "2014-07-20T17:50:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "90HHRC5KBPM", "description": "0104 - Al-Humazah ( The Slanderer ) - Holy Quran with Kurdish and English Recitation\n\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0632\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u064a\u0642\u0644\u064a\n\u0642\u0648\u0631\u0626\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u06c6\u0632 \u0644\u0647\u200c\u06af\u0647\u200c\u06b5 \u062e\u0648\u06ce\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0647\u200c\u0648\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u0648 \u0626\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0632\u06cc\n\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0629\nSaint Coran avec les Kurdes et la r\u00e9citation en anglais\n\nJoin us on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/qenglish1", "title": "0104 - Al-Humazah ( The Slanderer ) - Holy Quran with Kurdish and English Recitation", "publishedDate": "2011-11-30T06:18:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "90HRc6F2Hak", "description": "A song of non sense ore sonse ends is showing, that oldschool heavy metal freaks are looking like charles bukowski. enjoi that bala.\nthere ist one point: The sound..\nand the blue box turned to depression.", "title": "The blue box-berry boys", "publishedDate": "2006-12-08T16:26:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "90HfDc_Vue0", "description": "Quite beautiful.\nThe stitching And which one of you was a marksman at 10?\nKeep practicing, Bran.\nGo on.\nDon't think too much, Bran.\nRelax your bow arm.\nQuick, Bran!\nFaster.\nLord Stark!\nMy lady.\n\n\nArya Stark, Catelyn Stark, Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, Theon Greyjoy, Robb Stark, Bran Stark, Ned Stark, Eddard Stark,  Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones 1x01, Season 1, Maisie Williams, Michelle Fairley, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, Alfie Allen, Richard Madden, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Sean Bean", "title": "Bran Stark and Arya Stark funny scene", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T00:21:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "90ICvMd5ors", "description": "Free download http://soundcloud.com/proj14/agoraphobia/download\nSoundCloud http://soundcloud.com/proj14\nFacebook http://facebook.com/project14music\nTwitter http://twitter.com/project14music\n\nI don't usually do big room, but I thought I'd try it.

AND WATCH IN HIGH QUALITY!\n\n-//Loveless SOLDIER Productions\\\\-\n\nSo this is a little video I came up with when I first decided to use Ulead. This is an old idea and I actually started it about 6 months ago but never got round to finish it. Its a video about a samurai named Mitsunari Ishida and he appears in the game \"Samurai Warriors 2\" (Good game lol) And I know some of you people may be pondering about why Genesis is in there from Final Fantasy. Well he was put in by accident. I was putting some Mitsunari clips together when suddenly I added a Genesis one in by accident between two clips I edited and when I watched the video to check everything was in place, out pops Genesis with his book. And then an idea shot into my brain. Genesis, in my opinion, does have an uncanny resembelance to Mitsunari. Its like samurai version Genesis...or future version Mitsunari I dunno xD SO I added SOME clips of Genesis into the video and mostly just had close ups of his face and hair.\n\nI'm not completely happy about how this video turned out but its been hanging around in my \"Incomplete Projects\" folder for the past many months and I thought I'd upload it for the heck. I haven't uploaded anything since christmas O.O I was limited to clips for Mitsunari as I only own 6 clips of him so I had to make use of the effects (which to be honest....I over-used). I might deleate this video and change it again if I feel the need to but I hope you enjoy it anyway. Please comment and rate, feeback is great! :D\n\nWell hope you all enjoy this random video! \n\nClips: Samurai Warriors 2, Final Fantasy Crisis Core.\nProgram: Ulead Movie Maker\nTextures from/made: Made by myself.\nTime taken to complete: uh 5 months? \nTime taken to render: 10 minutes.\nDedicated to: MITSUNARI!!!! \n\nHonours?

The club face, in turn will be parallel to the left wrist.  If any of these angles are out it will usually be caused by one of two things.  An incorrect grip or an incorrect amount of forearm rotation on the backswing.  There are two incorrect wrist positions at the top of the backswing, one is a cupped position and the other is a bowed position.\n\n\n\nThe correct Golf Backswing Perfect wrist position at the top of your golf swing\n\nIf your club faced is too closed on the backswing this will cause you to be in a bowed position at the top of the swing.  People that get into this bowed position quite often will have applied the left hand incorrectly onto the golf club making it difficult for them to hinge their wrists correctly when they take the club away.  The cupped position is causes when somebody over rotates the golf club on the backswing.  This cupped wrist position will make them swing the club across the line making it difficult for them to swing down effectively from this position.", "title": "Golf swing The correct wrist angle", "publishedDate": "2014-03-08T18:38:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "90Omh7_I8vI", "description": "Courtesy: Fedor Potapov (0:00)\nCourtesy: SuperOlololololo (0:16)\nCourtesy: Andrey Korolev (0:36)\nCourtesy: mitslancer9 (1:02)\nCourtesy: Alexander Bulanov (1:16)\n\nWATCH OTHER VIDEOS OF METEORITE CRASH http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPszygYHA9K0wHNtfZELsbzbLh-8Hk1lm\n\nMeteorite explosions in the skies of Russia's Urals region has sparked panic in three major cities.

Since people with PKU are missing an enzyme to break down  the amino acid phenylalanine, these people cannot eat protein without the amino acid building up which can lead to brain damage and other neurological problems. Most children and adults with PKU must follow a special diet. The PKU diet involves strictly controlling the intake of natural protein (which contains phenylalanine), drinking a synthetic phenylalanine-free protein formula (known as medical food) and eating special low-protein food. The synthetic formula and special low-protein foods are expensive.  In addition, some patients benefit from Biomarin's Kuvan which is a pharmaceutical formulation of BH4, the co-factor for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH hydroxylates Phe through an oxidative reaction to form tyrosine. In patients with PKU, PAH activity is absent or deficient.
