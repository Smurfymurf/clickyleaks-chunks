Well, I'll tell you what, I'll come and see you there. But you're going to have to introduce me to them, because this is pretty much a bunch of non-entities, unknown.  I spoke to MEPs this morning who will be voting later, and most of them couldn't even name half of them.\n\nAnd the one from Britian is so obscure, his name, Lord Hill should be Lord Who, because the British public couldn't pick the bloke out of a line-up and he's never been elected to anything in his life, which means he's perfect for the job - because I don't think that the European public or commentators understand what the European Commission really is. \n\nThe Commission is the Executive, it is the Government of Europe, and it has the sole rights to propose legislation; it does so in consultation with 3000 secret committees, staffed mainly by big business and big capital, and all the legislation is proposed in secret.\n\nAnd once something becomes a European law, it is the European Commission themselves who have the sole right to propose repeal or change of that legislation.\n\nThe Community Method which you championed this morning, the means by which the European Commission makes law and holds law, is actually the very enemy of the concept of democracy itself. Because it means in any member state there is nothing the electorate can do to change a single piece of European law.\n\nSo we'll be voting against the Commission today, not on the basis of the individuals, but on the basis of the fact that it is a fundamentally un-, in fact, anti-democratic form of government.\n\nI suspect you're in for a tough time with this Commission.  You are going to have the euro crisis, which has not gone away and is going to get worse.\n\nAnd you are also going to have the UK debate, when now it hs become unacceptable to the vast majority of British citizens for there to be total free movement of people extended to half a billion people to come to Britain.\n\nMr Cameron masquerades as being an EU opponent, though I note this morning that the Conservatives are so brave that they are even going to abstain.\n\nI think this will be the last European Commission that governs Britain, because within the end of these five years we will be out of here.\n\nThank you.\n\n..................................\nVideo source: EbS (European Parliament)\n..................................\n\n\u2022 EU Member States:\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom", "title": "Farage: The Last European Commission that Governs Britain", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T09:06:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hI5SHjrMZ0", "description": "ProDen \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e14\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25\u0e34\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e39\u0e41\u0e25\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e20\u0e32\u0e22\u0e43\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22 \u0e2a\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22 Ascophyllum Nodosum \u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e04\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 ProDen  \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e30\u0e40\u0e25\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32\u0e13 250 \u0e21\u0e34\u0e25\u0e25\u0e34\u0e01\u0e23\u0e31\u0e21\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e04\u0e1b\u0e0b\u0e39\u0e25 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e07\u0e43\u0e14\u0e46\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e04\u0e21\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e36\u0e07\u0e21\u0e35\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 100% \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e38\u0e4c\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e40\u0e28\u0e29\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e41\u0e23\u0e48\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38\u0e40\u0e01\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e48\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e18\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e21\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e08\u0e33\u0e19\u0e27\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e08\u0e36\u0e07\u0e21\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e42\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e07\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e40\u0e09\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e22\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e20\u0e32\u0e22\u0e43\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01", "title": "ProDen Professional Dental Care \u0e01\u0e33\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T08:40:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hI7wVDa9Ww", "description": "Discover how Morgan Advanced Materials creates industry-leading ceramic injection moulded components with our short, animated process video. \n\nFrom the initial mixing process, involving our state-of-the art ceramic powders, to the precision moulding and sintering phases, we produce injection moulded components that deliver significantly enhanced performance for our customers' products and processes.", "title": "Ceramic Injection Moulding Process - Morgan Advanced Materials", "publishedDate": "2013-09-18T13:01:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hIC6qrQq8s", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "the pen of the hacienda!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T22:09:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hISk5MOcEQ", "description": "Cyrilla Landscaping & Supply Co.

It's easy to operate with several designs of rotor and stator work heads. http://www.ginhong.com/products/homogenizer/batch-homogenizer/\n\nLaboratory batch homogenizer is also named lab homogenizer or lab mixer. It's composed of a stainless steel stand which can placed on the working table or bench. A stainless steel pillar was fixed on the stand with an arm sticking out.\n\nThe homogenizer set was placed on this arm by a flange connection. There's a high speed motor of 3000rpm or 6000rpm which will drive the shaft to rotate. The rotor was fixed at the tip the rotating shaft with the stator housing it.\n\nThe rotor and stator are finely designed and machined to guarantee the minimum gap between them so that it can achieve the best emulsions possible. Because if the gap is smaller, the final particle size which passed through it will be smaller too.\n\nAnother important factor to get good emulsion is the tip speed of rotor or called linear velocity. Normally the tip speed is between 15 to 40 meters per second. For lab size homogenizer, we usually use 6000rpm motor which is much more powerful than 3000rpm motor.\n\nThe work head of rotor and stator has several designs. There're slotted stator, screen stator and grooved stator etc. According to different products to be processed, customer can choose different work head. And these work heads are interchangable. That means you can take one set the main homogenizer body and several different heads. You then change it when you make a specific product.\n\nGinhong usually uses 6000rpm motor with the slotted stator for lab batch mixer. The lifting and descending system is manually operated and keep the homogenizer head stop at any specific level inside the processing tank.\n\nA frequency inverter is equipped to adjust the speed of motor with the rotor.

We offer the world's strongest deer antler spray with an extract ratio of 75:1.\n\nOur authentic, high quality deer antler velvet extract is made from top grade, fresh deer antler velvet. Using a proprietary, confidential process, we extract its nutrients without the use of chemicals or heat. This unique extraction process maintains the full growth factor matrix, including IGF-1, in its naturally occurring state.\n\nAntler Farms deer antler velvet extract has an extract ratio of 75 to 1. This means it takes 75 pounds of fresh deer antler velvet to make one pound of Antler Farms deer antler extract -- a highly concentrated, unmatched product. \n\nMost deer antler velvet extracts on the market today are made by soaking deer antler velvet in alcohol. Using this method, typical extraction ratios are merely 4 to 1 or 5 to 1. More importantly, these extracts use heat to evaporate the alcohol, which compromises and degrades deer antler velvet's active ingredients. In other words, the very process used by our competitors to make their extract concentrations stronger is actually making their products weaker. \n\nOther manufacturers claim their deer antler velvet is processed with a high extract ratio. However, independent lab tests showed the deer antler velvet IGF-1 content in their products is minuscule. Why? Because despite the large quantity of raw material used, poor processing methods have destroyed the growth factors and likely other beneficial nutrients in the deer antler velvet itself. A high extract ratio, without the proper means of preserving the nutrients extracted, is meaningless.\n\nAt Antler Farms, we use innovative processing techniques that are designed to produce the purest, strongest products. The high concentration of active ingredients in our deer antler velvet extract spray means quicker results, more improvements and greater benefits.\n\nSubscribe to our Youtube Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AntlerFarms\n\nLearn more about Deer Antler Spray here:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-deer-antler-spray-2013-5\n\nFollow Us:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Antler-Farms/380986261980283\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/antlerfarms \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/antlerfarms\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/107834699518719544375/posts?hl=en\nYoutube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/AntlerFarms\n\nCheck out more of our Antler Farms videos below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjOsF_d1D_s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k69r8cwQRSU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRU0JjQ2S0w\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hhUrWcbwyQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jq7L6OBbj4\n\nLearn about all the benefits here:\nhttp://www.antlerfarms.com/what-is-deer-antler-velvet\n\nJoin a Facebook Group to learn more about Deer Antler products:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/deerantlerspray/\n\nVisit http://Antlerfarms.com to learn more about the World's strongest Deer Antler Spray!", "title": "**Deer Antler Spray** - Strongest Deer Antler Velvet Extract 75:1 Ratio", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T22:56:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hhwkDHaeRc", "description": "http://www.regalarflores.net Cuidados y consejos de la planta Anthurium - Todo sobre flores y planas. \n\u00a0 Enviar flores o plantas a domicilio", "title": "Cuidados de la planta Anthurium", "publishedDate": "2009-09-08T07:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hiYBqwameA", "description": "On the night of the \"Demand Our Stars\" event in Dallas, Texas for the upcoming release of The Fault in Our Stars, the MacGuffin was able to interview author John Green and actors Nat Wolff, Ansel Elgort, and Shailene Woodley as they hit the red carpet.", "title": "Shailene Woodley Red Carpet Interview - The Fault in Our Stars | The MacGuffin", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T16:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hjENnqF2WY", "description": "Fereydoon Moshiri was born September 21, 1926 in Tehran, Iran - died October 24, 2000 in Tehran) was one of the prominent contemporary Persian poets who versified in both modern and classic styles of the Persian poem.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States.\n\nOnly about 60 percent of American adults aged 50 and older get screened, even though the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in reducing deaths is supported by the available evidence.\n\nACP recommends that physicians perform an individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. Physicians should screen for colorectal cancer in average risk adults starting at the age of 50 and in high risk adults starting at the age of 40 or 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.\n\nRisk factors for colorectal cancer include increasing age; race -- African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer in the United States; personal history of polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, or colorectal cancer; or having a family history of the disease.\n\nOptions for screening for colorectal cancer include stool based and endoscopic/radiologic tests. The screening interval for average risk adults over the age of 50 is 10 years for colonoscopy; five years for flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and double contrast barium enema; and annually for fecal occult blood test.\n\n\"We encourage patients to engage in shared decision making with their physician when selecting a colorectal cancer screening test so that they understand the benefits and harms,\" said Virginia L. Hood, MBBS, MPH, FACP, president of ACP. \"The success of any screening program, especially colorectal cancer screening, is dependent on the appropriate testing and follow-up of patients with abnormal screening results as well as following up with patients for repeat testing at designated intervals.\"\n\nThe guidance statement does not recommend continued screening for colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 or in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years because the potential harms of screening outweigh the potential benefits.\n\nWhile colonoscopy is generally regarded as the gold standard to which other screening tests are compared, the risk factors of the test include possible bleeding, perforation of the intestine, and adverse reactions as a result of preparation required for the test.", "title": "American College of Physicians: Colorectal Cancer Screening Guidance Statement", "publishedDate": "2012-03-06T15:18:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hkhD-vPfMM", "description": "Music by Parazitii performing Avort verbal \u00a9 2001 20cmrecords", "title": "Parazitii-Avort verbal (nr.70)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-30T13:11:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0hkmK1TiB-s", "description": "Just4fun290 presents Fist Smashing Hulk tries to fist smash Disney Cars Mater and picks him up!

To ensure unidirectional current.The other major components of a DC generator are similar to that in an AC generator. A DC generator that contains a loop generates a pulsating DC current.To produce more stable current a coil with more turns is typically used.In a DC generator, when the coil rotates through ninety degrees, the change in magnetic flux induces an electro motive force of maximum strength.This current flows through the split rings to the brushes.When the coil is rotated further at one eighty degrees, the electro motive force becomes zero.At this point the contact between the commutator and the brushes is reversed.The first brush now comes in to contact with the second segment where the other brush comes into contact with the second segment while the other brush comes into contact with the first segment of the commutator.This keeps the current going in one direction\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\n K-12.

Es m\u00e1s t\u00edpicamente afecta a los adultos, pero los ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y los adolescentes puede tener, tambi\u00e9n. Debido a su naturaleza desagradable, las personas con psoriasis suelen sentirse muy avergonzado de tener y llegan a verdaderos extremos para cubrirlo en p\u00fablico. La comprensi\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo tratar la psoriasis es fundamental para aprender a manejar adecuadamente sus s\u00edntomas. Tener una comprensi\u00f3n general de lo que es y lo que hace que nos ayuda en la comprensi\u00f3n de los m\u00e9todos de tratamiento disponibles.\n\nSe pronuncia \"Suh-RY-uh-SUS\", la psoriasis es causada por una reacci\u00f3n exagerada del sistema inmunol\u00f3gico, lo que provoca inflamaci\u00f3n de la piel y descamaci\u00f3n de la piel. Normalmente, la piel en la psoriasis, donde no est\u00e1 presente, nuevas c\u00e9lulas de la piel crecen y se caen dentro de aproximadamente 4 semanas. C\u00e9lulas de la piel afectada por la psoriasis, sin embargo, crecen a un ritmo mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y no arrojar a las c\u00e9lulas sanas de la piel deber\u00eda. El resultado es una acumulaci\u00f3n de exceso de piel, que se conoce como las placas de psoriasis.\n\nMuchos temen que la psoriasis es contagiosa, pero no es as\u00ed y no hay ninguna posibilidad de que se propague al entrar en contacto con una persona que lo tiene.

Adem\u00e1s, algunas personas s\u00f3lo tienen un caso muy leve, mientras que otras experimentan s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s severos. Cuando se presentan s\u00edntomas, las siguientes son las m\u00e1s reconocidas:\n\n\u00b7 Sarpullido grueso (generalmente se encuentra en las manos, pies, rodillas, codos, cuero cabelludo o zonas de la espalda baja) \n\u00b7 La erupci\u00f3n puede ser de color rojo, blanco o plata en busca de color \n\u00b7 Picaz\u00f3n \npiel \u00b7 Tender\n\nEn los casos m\u00e1s graves de psoriasis, las personas pueden experimentar los s\u00edntomas de artritis conocida como artritis psori\u00e1sica. Las personas con este tipo de psoriasis normalmente se quejan de hinchaz\u00f3n, dolor en las articulaciones. La psoriasis grave, incluso a veces causa una p\u00e9rdida de u\u00f1as de los dedos y de los pies como resultado de la construcci\u00f3n de muertos piel debajo de ambas superficies y empujando el clavo del lecho de la u\u00f1a.\n\nTratamientos de psoriasis consisten principalmente en la gesti\u00f3n y el control de los brotes mediante la reducci\u00f3n de la probabilidad de que a trav\u00e9s de cambios de estilo de vida. Por lo tanto, es importante que una persona con psoriasis llevarse las siguientes precauciones diarias:\n\n\u00b7 Evitar el estr\u00e9s tanto como sea posible \n\u00b7 Mantener una dieta saludable y un peso saludable \n\u2022 Mantenga el sistema inmune fuerte y evitar infecciones, como amigdalitis estreptoc\u00f3cica, que pueden desencadenar un brote de psoriasis \n\u00b7 Evite la exposici\u00f3n excesiva al sol (y sobre todo evitar las quemaduras de sol) \n\u00b7 Evite las lesiones cut\u00e1neas (incluyendo incluso lesiones menores en la piel que rodea las u\u00f1as de las manos y de los pies) \n\u00b7 Evite los medicamentos que desencadenan o aumentar los s\u00edntomas de psoriasis \n\u00b7 Evite el consumo de cigarrillos \n\u00b7 Evite el consumo de alcohol\n\nCuidado de la piel es siempre para que las personas con psoriasis.

A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) may occur in a normal aging eye or may be associated with pathology such as vitreous hemorrhage or inflammation. In a normal eye, as in this example, the PVD appears as a thin and smooth line (arrow) on B-scan. When the globe is moved voluntarily by the patient, real time echography demonstrates a quick jerky motion of the sheet-like echo with movements continuing after the globe movement has ceased. This is helpful in differentiating a PVD from a retinal detachment, which typically has a slower undulating pattern of motion. If there was presence of blood or inflammatory debris associated with the PVD, the echogenic line might appear thicker, especially in the most gravity dependent portions of the globe (i.e., posterior and inferior).", "title": "Partial Vitreous Separation In A High Myope With A Posterior", "publishedDate": "2010-04-08T21:28:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "0iRD_gXq9nA", "description": "Bar freezer\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nCyclop-eeze FreezerBar\nwww.freezerbar.com\nSuperior Reef Nutrition is found in Cyclop-eeze FreezerBar.

And so was Prince George.\n\nThe two came face-to-face on Sunday at Taronga Zoo's enclosure, where it was officially named the Prince George Bilby Exhibit as part of Australia's gift following the prince's birth on July 22 last year.\n\nIt had been anticipated that Prince George would make his only public appearance at the zoo, but it wasn't confirmed until he was filmed being put into the car by his mum Kate.\n\nKate carried George - dressed in dark blue shorts, a striped lighter blue-coloured shirt, dark blue socks and shoes - as they entered the zoo.\n\nHe looked inquisitive, and was chuckling and looking at the cameras.\n\nKate had changed out the dove-grey Alexander McQueen outfit she wore to church, into a lemon cream broderie anglaise dress by a designer who did not want to be named. The dress had a fitted bodice and flared out to the knee.\n\nAfter a quick photo op, the family headed into the enclosure where the meeting took place.\n\nPrince William helped break the ice, when he enticed the bilby - renamed George - over with some food.\n\nKate held George close to the glass wall dividing the pair, and he started to show a keen interest in the endangered marsupial.\n\nBut despite being royal, he proved himself to be a normal baby - eagerly grabbing the stuffed bilby present before throwing it on the ground - and sticking a card straight in his mouth.\n\nThis was Prince George's second official function.\n\nDuring the New Zealand leg of the trip, he \"hosted\" a play group event with other babies his age at Government House.\n\nAfter the very short engagement, George returned to Admiralty House, while the duke and duchess continued through the zoo, feeding tree kangaroos, walking past giraffes, enjoying a bird show, and taking in the rhino conservation display.\n\nPrince George meets a bilby \n\nWhen Prince George met Bilby George", "title": "Prince George finally meets a bilby VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T06:17:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ijJOwL-sDg", "description": "Turner Sports", "title": "Zantac", "publishedDate": "2007-10-09T22:15:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ijMKf551_A", "description": "11 bales high, took 30 minutes to stack.

Obtaining medical marijuana status and staying out of legal trouble is still a thorny area, so follow these steps and avoid trouble.\n\n\nWarning\nPot is illegal under federal law in the U.S. and in many states and other countries. You may be subject to legal ramifications for possession and/or consumption of marijuana.\n\nStep 1: Research state laws\nResearch your state's laws to determine under what circumstances medical marijuana is legal for use as a medical treatment, if any.\n\nTip\nTalk to a legal professional to fully understand how the law is being applied in your area. States with medical medical marijuana laws include California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Vermont, and Montana.\n\nStep 2: Obtain proof of medical condition\nObtain proof of your medical condition by getting a copy of your medical record.\n\nStep 3: Get doctor approval\nConsult your physician. If they agree your condition is treatable with medical marijuana, get them to write a prescription.\n\nTip\nIf the doctors you've seen aren't open to the idea of marijuana as a treatment method, search for pro-legalization organizations that can direct you to a sympathetic care provider.\n\nStep 4: Obtain application\nObtain the appropriate application forms from your state and county governments.\n\nStep 5: Complete registration\nFill out the necessary paperwork and provide documentation to complete an application for medical marijuana status in your state. Submit it with any applicable registration fees that are required.\n\nStep 6: Get approval\nWait for your application to be approved and to receive your official medical marijuana license.

Released in 1994, the debut album from Fila Brazillia was launched into a world before big beat and trip hop took hold, but after the first flush of Orb and ELF-inspired ambient. Coming after the initial chunky Leftfield-style house of the first Pork releases, but before the spliff took hold and Pork got stuck into their current down 'n' easy groove we now all love so well, this album is truly unique. Those speech samples place it in an early Nineties framework and are every bit as effective as The Orb's Little Fluffy Clouds' 'Serratia Marcescans' mixes glittering ambient with the rambling reminiscences of a bunch of GIs fucked on acid. It's as brilliant as it sounds. Then tracks like 'The Light of Jesus' and 'Pots & Pans' pick up the pace with some chunky grooves that would fit in well enough at any Ibiza beach-front cafe. In places this has a lolling, hyper-cool, chill-out groove, such as on the supreme trip hop departure 'The Sheriff'. In others it's up and in your face. But it's always funky and always supremely melodic... a bit like a Sasha set on valium. In other words it's as essentially Balearic as a bottle of San Miguel outside Cafe Mambo. All the more surprising, then that the album is made by a bunch of stoners from Hull who have never been to the White Island. Any Fila Brazillia album is worth buying, but if you can manage to track this down, this alone it is worth its weight in lbizan gold.\nFrank Tope\n\nReviews for This Release:\n\n\"Buried Treasure  The one that got away  There can be little doubt that this is one of the best dance music albums ever made.

Produced by a band whose name has been banded around 'trendy' circles for a while and who have continually turned out well-crafted, solid singles. This pisses all over the wishy washiness of many people trying to create funky ambient sounds and if I was gonna compare, and I can't help myself, picks up from where Ultramarine's ' Every Man and Woman is a Star' left off.

York Department of Chemical, Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering awarded its first three baccalaureate degrees in 1923. Master's degrees were added after World War II, as returning veterans swelled the college's enrollment as well as the engineering workforce. The doctoral degree program was added in the late 50s, and the first PhD was awarded in 1964. An MS in Pharmaceutical Engineering program was established in 2004.\n\nFrom its earliest days, the department incorporated real-world work experience into the curriculum through cooperative education with area companies. The department's faculty has also developed research partnerships with industry and government. Chemical engineering alumni hold leading positions in business, law, research and academe.\n\nToday the department has an enrollment of 132 undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering, and more than 50 pursuing graduate studies. Last year, NJIT awarded 20 bachelor's degrees in chemical engineering, 13 master's degrees, and three PhDs. Chemical engineering currently enrolls the largest percentage of female students of any department in Newark College of Engineering -- 41 percent of the department's students are women.\n\nIn 2002, the department was renamed to honor Otto H. York, chemical engineer, entrepreneur and philanthropist, who is a long-time benefactor of the university. York has pledged $1 million to the department to establish an endowment supporting scholarships to attract outstanding students and to support faculty research.", "title": "What is Chemical Engineering", "publishedDate": "2010-10-25T15:02:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "0it_d88zWLM", "description": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity: Time Anomaly Trailer.

This article gives an overview of the various types of matrix multiplication.\nhe ordinary matrix product is the most often used and the most important way to multiply matrices. It is defined between two matrices only if the width of the first matrix equals the height of the second matrix. Multiplying an m\u00d7n matrix with an n\u00d7p matrix results in an m\u00d7p matrix. If many matrices are multiplied together, and their dimensions are written in a list in order, e.g. m\u00d7n, n\u00d7p, p\u00d7q, q\u00d7r, the size of the result is given by the first and the last numbers (m\u00d7r), and the values surrounding each comma must match for the result to be defined. The ordinary matrix product is not commutative.\n \nThe element x3,4 of the above matrix product is computed as follows\n \nThe first coordinate in matrix notation denotes the row and the second the column; this order is used both in indexing and in giving the dimensions. The element  at the intersection of row i and column j of the product matrix is the dot product (or scalar product) of row i of the first matrix and column j of the second matrix. This explains why the width and the height of the matrices being multiplied must match: otherwise the dot product is not defined.\nThe figure to the right illustrates the product of two matrices A and B, showing how each intersection in the product matrix corresponds to a row of A and a column of B. The size of the output matrix is always the largest possible, i.e. for each row of A and for each column of B there are always corresponding intersections in the product matrix. The product matrix AB consists of all combinations of dot products of rows of A and columns of B.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Multiplication Of Matrices Numerical", "publishedDate": "2010-04-26T08:39:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0j4P1DJSM4U", "description": "http://www.12minuteathlete.com/candlestick-pistol-rolls/\n\nPistols are one of those crazy hard bodyweight exercises that require extreme levels of strength, balance, mobility, and coordination, making them tough for people of all fitness levels.\n\nSo in today's video, I\u2019m going to show you how to get better at pistols by practicing your candlestick pistol rolls.\n\nYou'll want to start by first practicing a basic candlestick roll, so that you can get a sense of how the movement should feel before transitioning into pistol candlestick rolls. This will help you figure out the movement and the momentum needed to get yourself up off the ground back onto your feet.\n\nTo do a basic candlestick roll, start out by squatting down, then roll back so that you\u2019re on your upper back/shoulders with your feet straight above your hips (it's ok if they point slightly towards your head). Quickly roll back up on both feet.\n\nThere are two important points to keep in mind when doing candlestick rolls:\n\n#1: Make sure that when you\u2019re rolling back, your feet go straight to the sky, never past your head. Yes, it's ok if they point slightly towards your head as mine do in the video.\n\n#2: As you come forward out of the roll, try and drive your heels to your butt as fast as possible. The closer you can get your feet to your butt, the more efficient (i.e. easier) the movement becomes.\n\nPractice the basic candlestick roll a few times, then once you're comfortable with it, give a candlestick pistol roll a shot!\n\nTo do a candlestick pistol roll, you\u2019re going to do the same exact thing, except instead of getting up with both feet, you\u2019ll stick one out in front of you and use a single leg to get yourself up off of the ground.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re slightly off balance or need to use your opposite hand to steady yourself at first when you get off of the ground\u2014these will get easier with time, I promise.\n\nPractice these often, and you\u2019ll be well on your way to mastering pistols!\n\nGet the official HIIT app: http://www.12minuteathlete.com/app\nBlog: http://www.12minuteathlete.com\nSubscribe: http://www.12minuteathlete.com/subscribe/ \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/12minuteathlete\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/104560578595593640995 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/12MinuteAthlete\n\n\n__\n\n\nKrista Stryker is a certified personal trainer and the founder of 12minuteathlete.com, a website providing free, incredibly effective high intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts and awesome fitness motivation for athletes of all levels.

The Porta Bracket also allows the gearcase to be raised above the bottom of the boat without tilting, allows the propulsion line to remain parallel with the direction of the boat, and eliminates the need for lower unit anti-fouling paint.  The Porta Bracket is constructed of rugged aircraft aluminum.  It features one hydraulic cylinder per outboard, each with 5,000 lbs of lift.

It was released on the Los Angeles, Californian MoWest, a subsidiary of Motown Records formed by Berry Gordy. It existed between 1971 and 1973. The song was co-written, co-arranged, and sung by Marilyn McLeod (sister of Alice Coltrane) - in addition, she played the keyboard on the track. Melton Bolton played the guitar, and co-wrote the song. Horace Jones also contributed to the songwriting. Gene Page added the strings. \n\nBillboard included the song in their soul picks on 3 March 1973 - so it was only released a month after the signing of the Paris Peace Accords (27 January 1973). \n\nLike other releases on MoWest, this track blended different genres - this had a smooth soul feel, with very upbeat jazz-funk horns, and it ended with a military drum beat, as the song celebrated the \"happy days...good days\" as the soldiers returned from Vietnam. The narrator said that now the war had ended, there would be \"no more useless dying\" and \"senseless crying\", and nothing but \"joy, joy, joy\".  \n\n\"When your man or son is in the war\nThere not much to look forward for\nHappiness is in store\nWhen the brothers come marching home\nThere will be no more useless dying\nThere will be no more senseless crying\nThere will be nothing but joy, joy, joy\nEverybody will be so glad\nSisters will be shouting, mothers will be crying\nFathers will be shouting, children will be laughing...\nWhen the brothers come marching home\nTalking about happy days, talking about good days\nMarch 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4\"", "title": "The Nu Page - When the Brothers Come Marching Home", "publishedDate": "2013-03-10T20:54:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jClJuLU2qg", "description": "how the sr20 gear set rotates in the oil pump housing", "title": "SR20 oil pump gear set", "publishedDate": "2008-12-06T05:09:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jD2h8FHAnw", "description": "Matty Bullock on Apocalypse, Drayton Manor.

This is an optimal size for movie playback and gaming. iPhone 5 pictures show how small the new interface is, with the introduction of nine pins, signals could be better separated.

Species in the family include white-tailed deer, mule deer such as black-tailed deer, elk, moose, red deer, reindeer (caribou), fallow deer, roe deer, pud\u00fa and chital. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) and female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope, which are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance. The musk deer of Asia and water chevrotain (or mouse deer) of tropical African and Asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.\n\nThe word \"deer\" was originally broader in meaning, but became more specific over time. In Middle English, der (Old English d\u0113or) meant a wild animal of any kind. This was as opposed to cattle, which then meant any sort of domestic livestock that was easy to collect and remove from the land, from the idea of personal-property ownership (rather than real estate property) and related to modern chattel (property) and capital. Cognates of Old English d\u0113or in other dead Germanic languages have the general sense of \"animal\", such as Old High German tior, Old Norse djur or d\u0233r, Gothic dius, Old Saxon dier, and Old Frisian diar.\n\nThis general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. However, all modern Germanic languages save English and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, German Tier, Alemannic Diere or Tiere, Pennsylvania Dutch Gedier, Dutch dier, Afrikaans dier, Limburgish diere, Norwegian dyr, Swedish djur, Danish dyr, Icelandic d\u00fdr, Faroese d\u00fdr, West Frisian dier, and North Frisian diarten, all of which mean \"animal\". (However, contrary to south European languages, Dama in Latin and daim in French mean \"fallow deer\" only).\n\nFor most types of deer in modern English usage, the male is called a \"buck\" and the female is termed a \"doe\", but the terms vary with dialect, and especially according to the size of the species. For many larger deer, the male is termed a \"stag\", while for other larger deer the same words are used as for cattle: \"bull\" and \"cow\". The male red deer is a \"hart\", especially if more than five years old, and the female is a \"hind\", especially if three or more years old; both terms can also be used for any species of deer, and were widely so used in the past. Terms for young deer vary similarly, with that of most smaller species being called a \"fawn\" and that of most larger species \"calf\"; young of the smallest kinds may be a kid. A castrated male deer is a \"havier\". A group of deer of any kind is a \"herd\". The adjective of relation pertaining to deer is cervine; like the family name \"Cervidae\", this is from Latin: cervus, \"deer\".\n\nVenison originally described meat of any game animal killed by hunting, and was applied to any animal from the families Cervidae (deer), Leporidae (hares), and Suidae (wild pigs), and certain species of the genus Capra (goats and ibex), but in the northern hemisphere its usage is now almost entirely restricted to the flesh of various species of deer.[citation needed]\n\nIn Southern Africa, venison is the meat of antelope. There are no native Cervidae in sub-Saharan Africa.", "title": "Deer", "publishedDate": "2014-07-14T21:25:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jNKPRmH2cQ", "description": "\u266a \u266b \u266c \u262f\u262f CLICCA SU \"MOSTRA ALTRO\" \u262f\u262f \u266c \u266b \u266a\n\n\nRimani sempre aggiornato e seguimi su:\n\nFACEBOOK - http://www.facebook.com/robforchetta\nTWITTER - http://www.twitter.com/robforchetta\nGOOGLE+ - https://plus.google.com/+robforchetta/posts\nSOUNDCLOUD - https://soundcloud.com/robforchetta", "title": "Panini all'arancia", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T13:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jNOVlURE_8", "description": "X-PloD em apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o no Japanime Z, campe\u00f5es do Animestar! :D\n\nCom participa\u00e7\u00e3o de gente do grupo HSU! \\o/", "title": "JAPANIME Z - Grupos X-PloD + HSU", "publishedDate": "2009-10-12T01:45:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jNSnTuzog8", "description": "O pepino \u00e9 o fruto do pepineiro (Cucumis sativus), que se come geralmente em forma de salada.

In the United States the group is known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or the MeK.\n\nAlthough the MeK had initially sided with the mullahs during the 1979 Iranian Revolution to overthrow the shah, no sooner was the monarchy deposed that the newly created Islamic Republic turned on their one-time ally.\n\n\nThe NCRI was the first to alert the world to Iran's secret nuclear projects in August 2002. Earlier this year it revealed that Iran had re-started its nuclear program at 12 sites across the country. According to sources within the Iranian resistance, some 120,000 of its members and sympathizers have been executed by the mullahs.\n\n\nLast month Britain's Court of Appeal ordered the government to de-proscribe the PMOI. The court upheld a ruling in November by the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission that the government's decision to maintain the ban on the PMOI was \"flawed\" and \"perverse.\"\n\n\nAfter long debates in both Houses of Parliament the removal of the ban came into effect from 00.01 a.m. (GMT) on Tuesday June 24. This is a great moral victory for the Iranian resistance movement and comes at a time when the United States and the West are pushing for greater sanctions and pressures to be applied on the Islamic republic in efforts to convince the mullahs in Tehran to renege on their efforts to acquire nuclear capability.\n\n\nLord Corbett of Castle Vale, chairman of the British Parliamentary Committee for Iran Freedom, said: \"The real terrorists are in Tehran. They make the roadside bombs, and pay and train those who use them to kill British and coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\"This decision will give new hope to those in Iran who cry freedom and want their country to be part of the world community rather than a pariah.\n\n\n\"Our own government and others in the EU governments and the U.S. must now understand that the PMOI are our allies and not our enemies in beating back the menace that Iran's theocratic regime represents. It is trying to add violent abuse of human rights to its nuclear weapons development program to make a lethal mix which threatens the world's security,\" said Lord Corbett.\n\n\nMonday's parliamentary vote puts an end to a seven-year legal battle to have the PMOI lifted from the UK blacklist. The next step will be to try and convince the European Union -- and eventually the United States -- to follow the British example. \nCategory:  News & Politics", "title": "UK parliament takes PMOI off the terror list", "publishedDate": "2008-07-16T10:47:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jOmEg9p_c4", "description": "Lyrics:\n\nRicky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone\nLived 9 to 5 and he worked his fingers to the bone\nJust barely get out of school, came from the edge of town\nFought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, oh no\n\nHe had no money, oh, no good at home\nHe walked the streets as soldier and he fought the world alone\n\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go\n\nTequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline\nHe kept his motor running, but it never kept him clean\nThey say he loved adventure, \"Ricky's the wild one\"\nHe married trouble and had a courtship with a gun\n\nBang bang, shoot 'em up, the party never ends\nYou can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend\nAnd now it's\n\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go, ye-yeah\n\n\"Accidents will happen\", they all heard Ricky say\nHe fired his six-shot to the wind, that child blew a child away\n\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go\n18 and life, you got it, 18 and life, you know\nYour crime is time and it's 18 and life to go\n\nAsking Alexandria on iTunes - http://www.itunes.com/askingalexandria\nAsking Alexandria on GooglePlay - http://bit.ly/13rsOoG\n\nBuy official Asking Alexandria merch at - http://bit.ly/SJNBPF\n\nMake sure to check out \"Through Sin + Self Destruction\": http://bit.ly/LUsO5l\n\nPick up \"Through Sin + Self Destruction\" on iTunes here: http://bit.ly/JDBL29\n\nDon't have iTunes?

Thus, on nanometer is 10-9m, which is the length scale at which intermolecular forces and quantum effects take hold. To put the nanocale in a more understandable perspective, consider that the size of an atom relative to an apple is similar to the size of an apple relative to the planet Earth! Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) give us a window into this nanoscale world.\nAFM Principle\n- Surface Sensing\n  An AFM uses a cantilever with a very sharp tip to scan over a sample surface. As the tip approaches the surface, the close-range, attractive forces between the surface and the tip cause the cantilever to deflect towards the surface. However, as the cantilever is brought even closer to the surface, such that the tip is in contact with the surface, increasingly repulsive force take over and cause the cantilever to deflect away from the surface.\n- detection Method\n  A laser beam is used to detect cantilever deflections towards or away from the surface. By reflecting an incident beam off the flat top of the cantilever, any cantilever deflections will cause slight changes in the direction of the reflected beam. A position-sensitive photodiode (PSPD) can be used to track these changes. Thus, if an AFM tip passes over araised surface feature, the resulting cantilever deflection (and the subsequent change in direction of reflected beam) is recorded by the PSPD.\n- Imaging\n  AFM images the topography of a sample surface by scanning the cantilever over a region of interest. The raised and lowered features on the sample surface influence the deflection of the cantilever, which is monitored by the PSPD. By using a feedback loop to control the height of the tip above the surface-thus maintaining constant laser position - the AFM can generate an accurate topographic map of the surface features.\n\nLearn more about AFM Modes at http://www.parkafm.com", "title": "AFM Principle - How AFM Works", "publishedDate": "2013-10-26T15:48:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jPORxYD6z4", "description": "", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Blanc - [Guide - 007.

In his laboratory he observed with a high performance microscope that diseases dissolve under selective sound radiation and body tissue gets healthier. The human body is approximately 73% water and the tones have positive effects on the information memory of this water molecules. This slight changing of the elements of life works similar to homeopathy as coding of the energy field of a person.\nWhat's special about the NRT is the use of the laboratory sounds of Dr. Rife as musical-harmonic titles.

In addition, prepositions can be used in an idiomatic way that some students may find difficult and unfamiliar.

Clint Keller racing up from behind.\n\nEarlier today, Warren County Report exclusively reported that the complaints in a $30 million lawsuit charging the town and three councilmen with defamation and hurting a business would be served after the work session, held most Mondays in between the more formal twice-monthly council meetings.\n\nThe council had just voted to go into a closed session to discuss their lawsuit with the town attorney (an item conspicuously absent from the agenda) and it appeared to some that one meeting had ended but another had not yet begun as spectators, staff and reporters began packing their items up to leave.\n\nAt this point, process server Arena, 6'8\" tall and armed with size 18 feet and four 154-page copies of a lawsuit that could cost Front Royal taxpayers millions, casually sprung into action.\n\nArena first placed a folder in front of Town Attorney Thomas R. Robinett and walked away. Looking surprised, Robinett said \"Sir, you are going to interrupt a public meeting?\"\n\nArena said nothing and proceeded around the table toward his next target, Councilman Chris W. Holloway. Holloway sat and didn't say anything (yet.)\n\nNewly installed Mayor Tim Darr asked Arena to wait until after the closed session \"which will only last about five minutes.\" Arena slowed for a moment before placing the next folder in front of Holloway.\n\nFRPD Lt. Keller (presumably there to beef up the security normally provided solely by Chief Richard Furr) hurried to catch up to Arena and Furr stood guard at the other side of the table.\n\nCouncilman Tharpe (perhaps emboldened since he wasn't on Arena's $30 million hit list) issued some advice to Arena and instructions for Keller. \"You've been warned. Lock him up,\" Tharpe said in a most serious tone.\n\nAt this point target 3 Councilman Sayre (who had been ducking behind people throughout the meeting to avoid our reporter's camera) got up and walked around the table to flee Arena and his intimidating folders. Councilman Carson Lauder, target 4, sat calmly and took it like a man. Even calmer, considering he was being threatened with jail by a councilman, being told to leave by a mayor and town attorney and chased--albeit slowly--by the top two officials of the town police department, Arena simply proceeded to slowly walk around the table and drop the last two lawsuits of a lifetime in front of Lauder and where Sayre would be again seated, once Arena had left and it was safe to return.\n\nArena, followed closely by Lt. Keller, simply slowly walked out of the room and left the building.\n\nMayor Darr (who is not an attorney and may not have realized that the serving had been completed once the packets were placed in front of the recipients) asked Chief Furr to return the complaints to Arena.\n\n\"He's going to jail. He can't take them to jail,\" offered Tharpe, unaware that Arena had committed no crime and already left the building.\n\nTown Attorney Robinett, realizing the deed had been done, suggested they keep the thick folders.\n\nAs the only person in the room with a video camera, I stayed to capture all this, apparently drawing the ire of target 2 Holloway who turned to me and said, \"Hey Dan, this is a closed meeting,\" while raising his eyebrows almost to his scalp and jabbing at the air toward the door with his pen.\n\n\"I'm leaving, chill out buddy,\" I said to Holloway as I very slowly packed up my things and kept the camera rolling for a few more precious seconds.\n\nCouncil then went into closed session to discuss the lawsuit and were perhaps advised on the matter for the last time by Town Attorney Robinett, who's own packet probably contained a letter from Attorney David W. Silek warning that Robinett would be called as a witness in the case and would most likely be deposed, making it improper for him to offer any further advice or counsel on the case to his clients.\n\nDan McDermott: editor@warrencountyreport.com", "title": "Councilman asks police to lock up process server as members receive $30 million lawsuit", "publishedDate": "2010-07-20T01:28:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jfLsqLL9UQ", "description": "Jeff Dunham And Peanuts bad hair day", "title": "Jeff Dunham And Peanuts bad hair day", "publishedDate": "2011-09-15T10:35:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jfMz04tJys", "description": "", "title": "Open the box", "publishedDate": "2014-01-12T01:16:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jfU7pw76ZE", "description": "Get the FULL ALBUM now on iTunes!: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/starbomb/id780059376\n---------------- Also available on -----------------\n\nPhysical CD: http://www.rodeoarcade.com/collections/starbomb/products/star-bomb-cd\nCDBaby: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/starbomb\nRhapsody\nEmusic\nGreatIndieMusic \nAmazon MP3 \nLast.fm \nSpotify: https://play.spotify.com/album/14N06uP4jozH8azjKvvgAZ\n7digital \n24-7 \nOmnifone \nRdio \nMuve Music \nSlacker Radio \nShazam \nNokia \nBloom.fm \nMediaNet \nXbox Music \nMySpace Music \niHeartRadio \nJB Hi-Fi 12/13/2013\nSamsung Music Hub \nBeyond Oblivion \nMondia Media \nSimfy \n\nMERCH available at: http://www.rodeoarcade.com/collections/starbomb\n\nStarbomb Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/starbombband\n\nStarbomb Twitter: https://twitter.com/starbomb\n\nStarbomb is \n\nNinja Sex Party: http://www.youtube.com/ninjasexparty\n\nEgoraptor: http://www.youtube.com/egoraptor\n\nhttp://www.starbomb.com\n\nThanks to Rachel Bloom for her AWESOME vocals! https://www.youtube.com/user/racheldoesstuff\n\nNeon Starbomb Intro created by Nic Vaughan\nhttps://twitter.com/NicVersus \n\nRoyalty-free sound effects from AudioMicro.com", "title": "Luigi's Ballad ANIMATED MUSIC VIDEO - Starbomb", "publishedDate": "2013-12-17T19:00:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jfiThYOGkI", "description": "Italian Master Stone Carver Roberto Chiti uses long, metal, power tools, smaller hand tools, a lathe and sand paper to turn a block of alabaster into a bowl during a demonstration at Middletown High School.

Numbers matching 300hp 327ci engine, 4 speed manual transmission. Assembled on November 18, 1966, this 1967 Corvette Convertible looks to be a very original survivor car that has received some recent freshening. The most recent owner of this car purchased vehicle from his uncle, who bought the car new. Therefore, it is safe to say that this is a one family car! Paint on this car looks to be brand new and is in excellent condition with plenty of shine and no apparent flaws. Chrome bumpers look to be newer as well both front and rear, and are also in excellent condition. Most of the weatherstripping and the convertible top also look to be new. This 1967 Corvette Convertible wears 6 inch rally wheels in very good condition, with very good trim rings and center caps. Tires are Michelin radials, which sport a period-correct tread pattern. Unlike the exterior, which looks pretty much brand new, the interior of this car is very much original. Seat covers, door panels, dash pad, center console, and carpet all look to be older if not original, but are in very good condition showing no major wear, fading, or other issues. Gauges appear unrestored, but have bright needles and minimal lens clouding. Correct GM seatbelts are also present, and a Kenwood cassette stereo has replaced the original radio in its original location. Steering wheel is in good original condition. The original engine in this car was cast on Halloween in 1966, and has correct casting numbers on both the intake manifold and Holley carburetor. Ignition shielding is present, and the engine compartment looks to have an older detailing/paint job. A set of finned aluminum 350hp style valve covers have been added; the only other additions to this car appear to be a set of sidepipes and a fitted outdoor car cover. This 1967 Corvette Convertible represents an excellent value for what is widely agreed upon as the single most desirable model year, so don't expect it to last long! Factory features include power windows, 4 speed manual, AM/FM radio.

Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, and featuring judges Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Lopez, and Keith Urban, along with in-house mentor Randy Jackson, the series empowers contestants and viewers to share their voices in deciding who will be America's next singing superstar. \n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of hopefuls from across the nation audition for a shot at stardom. The show's judges will travel across the country including stops in Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Boston, MA; Detroit, MI; Omaha, NE, Salt Lake City, UT; and San Francisco, CA, in search of the next AMERICAN IDOL. They narrow down the competitors to a select group of semifinalists who sing their hearts out each week in front of a studio audience and television viewers.\n \nThe judges have their say after every performance, but it's the viewing public that determines who will advance to become a finalist and who will go home. Telephone, text message and online voting begin immediately after each live performance show, and the results are announced during the following night's live broadcast. \n\nEventually the competition is whittled down to two finalists who compete for a major recording contract with 19 Recordings and the AMERICAN IDOL title. Past winners Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery Phillip Phillips, and Candice Glover, as well as fan-favorites Jennifer Hudson, Adam Lambert, Chris Daughtry, and Katharine McPhee, have all become household names and made their marks on the recording industry.\n\nSuperstars Made Here - AMERICAN IDOL XIV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/americanidol", "title": "Superstars Made Here - AMERICAN IDOL XIV", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T09:00:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "0jra_ZgqCx4", "description": "The movie presents a two-component coarse-grain molecular dynamics model of the erythrocyte membrane. The key feature of this model is combination the lipid bilayer and the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Therefore, the model possesses fluidic behavior of the lipid bilayer and elastic properties of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. Three types of coarse-grained particles are introduced in the model to represent clusters of lipid molecules, actin junctions and band-3 complexes, respectively. The first part of the movie shows the membrane model at equilibrium and the second part shows the membrane model under compression. \n\nPlease visit our website Computational Mechanics Laboratory (http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~gelyko/research.html) at the University of Connecticut for more information on our research.

In most high schools, you have to pass a test to get out.  At Walnut Hills High School, you have to pass a test to get in.\n    \nMarvin Kraus got in, \"Well in our family education was everything.  It was pounded into our head.\"\n    \nMarvin's son Matthew got in saying, \"This is the kind of place if you tried to create it from scratch today you couldn't do it. This is a gem and we have to nurture it.\"\n      \nAnd Marvin's granddaughter, Matthew's daughter, Shyra got in too, \"I think it's really meaningful that it's a family tradition.  I take a lot of pride in the fact that my dad went here and my grandfather went here.\"\n\nThat's not uncommon.  Walnut Hills is so good that it actually keeps people in the city of Cincinnati.  Urban school systems have lots of problems, including shrinking enrollment.  But with more than 2,400 students grades 7-12, Walnut Hills has been growing.\n\nPrincipal Jeff Brokamp said, \"The greatest cause of our enrollment growth in recent years has been as a result of families who traditionally have not sent their children to public schools and looking at Walnut Hills and saying, 'Oh my!'\"\n    \nBack when Marvin Kraus started at Walnut, the school already had its reputation for excellence.  Founded in 1895 the original building, now apartments, still stands a couple of miles away.  The current building dates to 1932.   But what makes Walnut Hills, Walnut Hills is inside.\n\n\"Rigor means offering more advanced placement courses than any school in the country, which we do,\" said Principal Brokamp.\n\nMost top rated high schools are suburban and overwhelmingly well to do and white.  Walnut Hills embraces and embodies diversity.  Marvin Kraus was valedictorian, the excellence he had continues, changing with the times.  New technology, different demographics, but still cherishing learning for its own sake.  How many other public schools have Latin?\n     \nWalnut Hills puts education in your blood.  Principal Brokamp went here as well.\n\nHe said, \"I knew Walnut Hills was a special place and I came to know that over dinner.  My dad was the Principal here.  That's all we talked about.\"\n\nJeff's dad, Ray, went on to become Superintendent.  As for a current student like Shira , who's off to Bryn Mawr College in the fall, she's not sure what she'll become.  But Shyra says if she ends up back in Cincinnati and has kids, there's no doubt where they would go to school.\n\nAs Principal Brokamp noted, Walnut Hills enrollment is on the rise.  Next year they're looking at around 2,600 students.\n\n\n\nFollow Jeff Hirsh on Twitter @local12jeff and LIKE him on Facebook.", "title": "So Cincinnati: Walnut Hills rated top public high school in Ohio", "publishedDate": "2014-05-30T13:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0k4ZtwnnbMY", "description": "Everything We Know So Far About PS4, Xbox One & PC GTA 5 - GTA 5 NEW Features, Details & MORE!

The Museum is dedicated to inspiring curiosity, discovery, and learning about the natural world through its unparalleled research, collections, exhibitions, and education outreach programs. Opened in 1910, the green-domed museum on the National Mall was among the first Smithsonian building constructed exclusively to house the national collections and research facilities.\nWhether looking at the history and cultures of Africa, describing our earliest Mammalian ancestor or primate diversity around the world, examining ancient life forms including the ever popular dinosaurs, or exploring the beauty of rare gemstones such as uniquely colored diamonds, the Museum's temporary and permanent exhibitions serve to educate, enlighten and entertain millions of visitors each year. The main building on the National Mall contains 1.5 million square feet of space overall and 325,000 square feet of exhibition and public space; altogether the Museum is the size of 18 football fields, and houses over 1000 employees. With a growing network of interactive websites, the Museum is transforming itself into a hub for national and international electronic education, accessible to anyone with access to the internet.\nThe Museum includes a state-of-the-art collections storage facility in Suitland, Maryland; a marine science research facility in Ft. Pierce, Florida; and field stations as far away as Belize, Alaska, and Kenya. Research activities are organized into seven departments, and a number of affiliated U.S. government agencies on-site contribute to the Museum's strength, including the Department of the Interior (U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources Division), the Department of Agriculture (Systematic Entomology Laboratory), the Department of Commerce (National Marine Fisheries Service Systematics Laboratory), and the Department of Defense (Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit).At the center of the Museum's exhibition and research programs are its expertly documented collections: more than 126 million natural science specimens and cultural artifacts. Just to name a few of our museum holdings, the collections include 30 million insects carefully pinned into tiny boxes; 4\u00bd million plants pressed onto sheets of paper in the Museum's herbarium; 7 million fish in liquid-filled jars; and 2 million cultural artifacts, including 400,000 photographs housed in the National Anthropological Archives. Over 3\u00bd million specimens are out on loan each year; over 15,000 visitor days are spent in the collections; and there are almost 600,000 additional visits to collection data bases available on the Web.\nThrough its research, collections, education and exhibition programs, NMNH serves as one of the world's great repositories of scientific and cultural heritage as well as a source of tremendous pride for all Americans.\n \n\nPlease subscribe to our videos to see weekly family travel and adventure videos.

An assistant lay catechist, he was killed \"in hatred of the faith\" by Chamorro natives while trying to defend his fellow missionary Jesuit priest Diego Luis de San Vitores.\n \nThrough historical reenactments interspersed with interviews with Church experts and followers, GMA News TV's provides the audience with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Calungsod's life.  Young actor Rocco Nacino portrays the title role with much sensitivity. \n \nSan Pedro Calungsod will air on Sunday, October 21 at 8:40 PM, the day Calungsod is canonized.  \n\nThe canonization is a big event for the over 80% Catholics in the Philippines.

The Purification: The Chalice is rinsed with cold water, allowing the glass to reach the same temperature as the beer.\n2. The Sacrifice: The tap is opened in one swift motion to let the first burst of foam flow away to ensure every drop of your Stella Artois is fresh.\n3. The Liquid Alchemy: The Chalice is held at a 45-degree angle so that when the beer begins to circulate, it creates the ideal proportion of foam relative to liquid.\n4. The Crown: The creation of the foam head occurs by straightening and lowering the glass. This initial foam is important as it prevents the beer from coming into contact with the air and losing any flavor.\n5. The Removal: The tap is closed in one smooth action and the Chalice is quickly removed to prevent any drops from falling into the glass.\n6. The Beheading: While the head is flowing over the edge of the glass, your bartender cuts it gently with a knife on a 45-degree angle. This eliminates the larger bubbles, which burst easily and accelerate the dissipation of the head.\n7. The Judgment: Your bartender then checks that the foam is 2 fingers (3 cm) thick. The final head creates a protective \"\"cap\"\" that keeps your Stella Artois from going stale.\n8. The Cleansing: Your bartender then rinses the bottom and sides of the glass. This step keeps the outside of the Chalice clean and comfortable to hold.\n9. The Bestowal: Finally, your Stella Artois is served to you on a coaster, accompanied by the drip catcher at the base. Behold the perfect glass of Stella Artois. Cheers to you, and for your patience, a refreshing reward.", "title": "Stella Artois | How to Pour a Beer - The 9-Step Pouring Ritual", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T18:56:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0kOyw35o0b8", "description": "Fuse ODG's Album 'T.I.N.A' on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/FuseODGTINA \n\nBuy From iTunes Here\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/million-pound-girl-badder/id742307649\n\nhttp://twitter.com/FuseODG\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Fuse-ODG/178290785591388\nhttp://www.3beat.co.uk\nhttp://www.twitter.com/3beatmusic\nhttp://www.facebook.com/3beatmusic\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/3BeatProductions\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/3beat\n\nMOBO award winner Fuse ODG is back with another irresistibly catchy and uplifting track -- \"Million Pound Girl (Badder Than Bad)\". \n\nThe follow up to his smash singles \"Azonto\" and \"Antenna\" is a dancehall powered Afrobeats jam that showcases Fuse's versatility as an artist and is guaranteed to get dancefloors bumping. \n\nProduced by top Ghanaian producer KillBeatz, the single has already been playlisted by Manchester's Unity Radio and London's Bang Radio. \n\nThe video - which features cameos from stars such as Sean Paul, Patrice Muamba and Eddi Kadi as well as 1Xtra's Charlie Sloth and Sarah Jane Crawford - hit over 50 thousand YouTube views in its first week online.", "title": "Fuse ODG - Million Pound Girl (Badder Than Bad) [UK Radio Edit]", "publishedDate": "2013-11-08T15:26:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0kP1GStNKKg", "description": "IT'S THE SHIP 2014, Asia\u2019s Largest Festival on a CRUISE brought to you by The Livescape Group. \nWe are proud to present our FULL LINE UP! \n\nGet ready for 5 days 4 nights of cruise madness!

A massive project called ENCODE found that in test tubes about 80% of the genome seemed to have some biological activity, such as affecting whether genes turn on. Whether that translated to any useful or necessary function for humans wasn't resolved.\n\n\"It's probably the greatest blunder in the history of Molecular Biology to state that \"junk DNA\" has no function.\"\n- Good thing I didn't say that. Learn to read, buddy.\nJames Wallace has replied to a comment on Do Mutations REALLY Improve Life?:\n        Actrivality, you really are quite stupid. The non-coding sections of the DNA (Introns, Pseudogenes) are proving more and more everyday to possess importance and cellular function for the moment-by-moment operations of the cell. It's probably the greatest blunder in the history of Molecular Biology to state that \"junk DNA\" has no function. Do your research, buddy.\nNovel 'Junk DNA' Sequences Jumpstart Protein Production \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fwoi3UTDdA\n\nMark 8:36\nFor what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?\nEvolutionary scientists tell us that mutations were central to the production of the great variety of creatures on Earth today from the first living cell. At the same time, biologists admit that 99 percent of all mutations are harmful. But, argue evolutionists, if you add up that one percent of good mutations over millions of years, you get the beautiful variety of living things we have today. Let's take a closer look, even granting the unproven claim that one percent of mutations are helpful.\n\nFor argument's sake, let's compare evolution's business with human business. Let's say you start a business with $100. As is not unusual, you lose $10 the first year, the equivalent of a bad mutation. As you become more experienced in business, you lose less in the years that follow, but since only one out of 99 mutations is good, you continue to lose an average of $1 for the next 98 years. By the time your good mutation  your year of profit  comes along, you're $8 in debt. Even a big mutation  say, a profit of $20  will not be enough to make up for the next 99 years of even small losses. In short, this is no way to do business, either for you or for evolution. Neither you nor evolution can possibly make any gains, even with one percent of the mutations being good. \n\nThe evolutionary claim that all life today is a result of mutations, runs counter to logic, common sense and simple arithmetic. The only way we can reasonably account for life's variety is to acknowledge the work of a wise and powerful Creator.\n\nThe fairy tale story of mutations - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation\n\nQuotes by Evolutionary Scientists Against Evolution - http://www.warneveryone.com/evolution_scientists_quotes.htm", "title": "Do Mutations REALLY Improve Life?", "publishedDate": "2009-09-30T09:45:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "0kwpKAbhPWI", "description": "http://youtu.be/w6l2worqdDU - Men In Black 3 Trailer!\nhttp://bit.ly/clevvermovies - Click to Subscribe!\nhttp://Facebook.com/ClevverMovies - Become a Fan!\nhttp://Twitter.com/ClevverMovies - Follow Us!\n\nJemain Clement talks about his new movie 'Men In Black 3', the time travel element in the film, how his character \"Boris\" fits into the story and what it took to apply the make-up every day.\n\nMen In Black III hits theaters on May 25th, 2012.\n\nCast: Will Smith, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Jemaine Clement, Emma Thompson, Nicole Scherzinger, Alice Eve, Bill Hader, Michael Stuhlbarg\n\nIn Men in Black\u2122 3, Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back... in time.

Shooting by 9-year-old girl stirs debate over guns.\nWATCH: how Nine-year-old girl accidentally kills Arizona shooting instructor with an Uzi. Video footage: how 9-year-old girl shoot her gun instructor to death by submachine Uzi set to fully automatic mode.\nMohave County Sheriff's officials released this video of shooting instructor Charles Vacca, of Lake Havasu City, moments before he was accidentally shot by a 9-year-old girl he was teaching. Authorities say the girl pulled the trigger and the recoil send the gun over her head. Vacca later died of his injuries.\nThe incident occurred at the Last Stop shooting outdoor range in White Hills.\nThis video stops before the actual shooting occurs.\n(Vegas Review Journal) KINGMAN, Ariz. \u2014 An instructor who was shot by a 9-year-old girl who fired an Uzi at a northwestern Arizona shooting range died Monday night at University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\nThe girl fired the weapon at the outdoor range that caters to heavy tourism traffic along U.S. Highway 93 between Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon Skywalk.\nHighway signage and Internet advertising beckons visitors to stop in, fire a machine gun and enjoy a meal at the Bullets and Burgers enterprise at the Last Stop, about 25 miles south of Las Vegas.\nThe Mohave County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the accidental shooting occurred about 10 a.m. Spokeswoman Trish Carter said the girl, who was vacationing from New Jersey with her parents, was standing next to the instructor at the time.\nMohave County Sheriff Jim McCabe described a video taken of the accident as \u201cghastly.\u201d His office released a short video of the girl taking her first few shots.\nHe said the girl safely and successfully fired the 9 mm weapon several times when it was set in the \u201csingle-shot\u201d mode.\nHe said the weapon was put into the \u201cfully-automatic\u201d mode before the girl fired again with the instructor standing off to her left. The weapon recoiled and drifted left as the girl squeezed off an undetermined number of rounds as she maintained possession but lost control of the Uzi as it raised up above her head.\n\u201cThe guy just dropped,\u201d McCabe said of shooting instructor Charles Vacca, 39, of Lake Havasu City, who suffered at least one gunshot to the head.\nJeff Frichette, director of training for The Range 702 in Las Vegas, said the incident in Arizona would never occur at his business. He credited this to how continuously shooting range\u2019s safety officers are trained.\n\n\u201cHypothetically\u201d a 9-year-old would be able to shoot a fully-automatic weapon, but it\u2019s a discretionary decision, he said.\nThat decision is based on physical and safety guidelines, he said.\nChildren need to understand the concept of safety before they are allowed to shoot, Frichette said.\nAlso, they must be \u201cphysically and mentally prepared\u201d before they are allowed to shoot a fully automatic weapon. This includes a 4-foot height requirement, he said, adding that even then, they have to master other weapons such as a semi-automatic .22-caliber rifle before they\u2019re allowed to shoot a fully automatic.\nHe added that a petite-looking child would likely only be allowed to shoot a semi-automatic rifle.\nThe Review-Journal contacted several other gun ranges in Las Vegas. One did not return a call and officials at another two declined to comment.\nAn autopsy on Vacca\u2019s body will be performed by the Clark County coroner\u2019s office.\nMcCabe said no citations will be issued and no charges will be filed as the shooting range is a licensed and legal operation.\nThe Bullets and Burgers website markets a unique shooting experience for customers.\n\u201cOur guests have the opportunity to fire a wide range of fully automatic machine guns and specialty weapons,\u201d the website states. \u201cAt our range, you can shoot FULL auto on our machine guns.\n\u201cLet \u2018em Rip!\u201d\nLas Vegas Review-Journal writer Ricardo Torres contributed to this report.\n(AP) DOLAN SPRINGS, Ariz. \u2014 An Arizona shooting instructor was accidentally shot and killed while showing a 9-year-old girl how to use an automatic Uzi, authorities said Tuesday.\nCharles Vacca, 39, of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, died Monday shortly after being airlifted to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, Mohave County sheriff\u2019s officials said.\nVacca was standing next to the girl at the Last Stop outdoor shooting range in White Hills when she pulled the trigger and the recoil sent the gun over her head, investigators said.\nAuthorities said the girl was at the shooting range with her parents.

El trazado urbano es sinuoso e irregular, existiendo a veces zonas despobladas. \nLas ciudades tienen diferentes barrios, que agrupan a la poblaci\u00f3n en funci\u00f3n de su procedencia, su religi\u00f3n o su actividad. El desarrollo econ\u00f3mico de algunas urbes, especialmente las dedicadas al comercio, hizo que se construyeran nuevas \u00e1reas. En \u00e9stas, las viviendas pod\u00edan alcanzar dos o tres plantas. \nEl centro de la vida urbana lo ocupa la plaza, en la que se sit\u00faan los edificios m\u00e1s representativos. Estos son altos, realizados en piedra, con balcones que se abren a la calle. Un escudo, tambi\u00e9n en piedra, indica que sus portadores pertenecen a un noble linaje. \nDe la plaza parte un sinf\u00edn de calles, algunas estrechas y tortuosas, siempre ocupadas por una intensa actividad. En ellas se desarrollaba buena parte de la vida diaria de la comunidad: comprar, vender, pasear, relacionarse... Sin duda, el mercado era el centro econ\u00f3mico y social de la poblaci\u00f3n. \nLas casas de los artesanos serv\u00edan al mismo tiempo como taller y tienda, por lo que se abr\u00edan al exterior. Adem\u00e1s, muchas viviendas pod\u00edan contar con un solar en su parte posterior, que era utilizado como huerto y en el cual pod\u00eda existir un pozo. --\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestro canal : \n\u25b6 http://bit.ly/10rPVgk\n\nS\u00edguenos en: \n\u25b6 https://www.facebook.com/artehistoria\n\u25b6 http://pinterest.com/artehistoria/\n\u25b6 https://twitter.com/ArteHistoriaCom\n\u25b6 http://www.youtube.com/artehistoriacom/\n\nArteHistoria : la web del Arte y la Cultura en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nArtehistoria es una iniciativa privada dedicada a la creaci\u00f3n de contenidos culturales mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas inform\u00e1ticas de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n en las que se combinan las recreaciones y animaciones tridimensionales de ciudades, edificios y escenas de vida cotidiana a muy alta poligonizaci\u00f3n, con la creaci\u00f3n de mapas evolutivos, estudios compositivos, digitalizaci\u00f3n de documentos, etc. Todo ello acompa\u00f1ado siempre de una informaci\u00f3n documental avalada por los profesores m\u00e1s destacados de la Universidad espa\u00f1ola.

Places where we can be truly happy, living the life we actually want to live. What if we could live in these places forever?\n\n---------------------\n\nArtist Statement:\n\n There are places in my reality where I am completely at peace with myself and mind. I can address my thoughts and emotions, and formulate views and opinions. Our reality is never perfect, we strive to achieve what we perceive as happy, and are driven by this. Certain moments in my life I feel completely happy. I often wish I can live in that moment, or live that feeling for the rest of my life. Institutions setup by our society often limit the perfect life we strive to achieve. Society wants us to go to school, get a job, support a family, retire when we get old and teach our children the same routine \u2013 but what if there was an escape from this cycle? Certain places and people can temporarily take us out of our reality, almost placing us in a surreal state of mind, a completely euphoric feeling that we value.  \n\n\n My film aims to bring this idea forth and tells the viewers that they don\u2019t have to live in the undesirable reality they are in. The man in my film finds his temporary escape, the shower. When he discovers the completely enchanted surreality available to him he is overwhelmingly happy for the first time in wheat seems like forever. He is free from the reality he is forced into and can do what he want and be truly happy, but this is only temporary, as society\u2019s institutions soon kick him back into reality. He seeks a permanent fix to this, a permanent fix to his seemingly endless hopeless cycle. He finds that he can take elements from his surreality into his reality, slowly making his reality better as he takes more elements from one world to another. After gathering enough materials he builds a permanent fix to his hopeless reality, built with all the things that make him happy. In the end he is transported into his euphoric surreality forever, he is truly happy.\n\n We all don\u2019t have to succumb to society\u2019s expectations for how we have to live our life, find your escape, find what makes you truly happy and live the life you want to live. \n\n\u201cInstead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don't need to escape from.\u201d \u2013Seth Godin\n\n\n---------------------\n\nA short film by Callum Linden\nStarring Reid MacMaster\n\nThanks to Mr.Morgan, Dad and the film department. \n\n\"You see yourself locked in a room with a cauldron on your head, dreaming of more.\" - Mr. Morgan on \"Transport Chairlift\"\n\n---------------------\n\nShot on the Canon Rebel T4i, with Magic Lantern installed and using the Technicolor Cinestyle colour profile.

Each movement relates to a unique musical symbol: Treble Clef (Introduction), Crescendo, Fermata, Staccato, Trill, Slur, Sforzando, and Decrescendo. The navigation of these miniatures is integrated as part of the performance. The videos feature a DVD style navigation, where a performer selects which videos to play by scrolling through a periodic table. For display in art galleries, libraries, and other non-performance venues, the DVD can cycle through the movements itself (randomly or in order), as if someone were navigating the menu options.\n\nThe miniatures themselves feature a variety of stylistic traits. Crescendo is a procedural look at assembling a simple scale on a toy piano. Fermata is a low, relaxed presentation of synthetic sounds and live vocalists that lives in a state of perpetual suspension. Staccato is a high energy glimpse at the objects we see every day. Trill plays on the dichotomy of two opposing notes, swirling and spinning around each other. Slur features musicians that seem to play forever. Sforzando is a campy look at the horror idiom; it features a repeated vocal line over an improvisatory Moog Synthesizer. Decrescendo ends the set with a slow zoom out, featuring trumpet and electronic voices. The piece has been performed on several different size screens, but it is most successful on as big a screen as one can obtain.", "title": "Decrescendo (from Elements)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-08T03:34:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0lIpeo3YgfQ", "description": "Balacera En Vivo Grabada Por Reportero\nbalacera en tampico madero en la playa\nBALACERA EN VIVO CON SICARIOS VS NARCOS(GRANADA)\nBalacera en fresnillo.
