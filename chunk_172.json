The newly created Bose-Einstein condensates - clouds of millions of ultracold, weakly interacting alkali-metal atoms that occupy a single quantum state - offer the possibility of investigating superfluidity in the weak-coupling regime. An outstanding question is whether Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a mesoscopic quantum analogue of the macroscopic vortices in superfluids, and what its experimental signature would be. Here we report calculations of the low-energy states of a rotating, weakly interacting Bose gas. We find a succession of transitions between stable vortex patterns of differing symmetries that are in general qualitative agreement with observations of rotating superfluid helium, a strong-coupling superfluid. Counterintuitively, the angular momentum per particle is not quantized. Some angular momenta are forbidden, corresponding to asymmetrical unstable states that provide a physical mechanism for the entry of vorticity into the condensate.", "title": "Rotating Bose-Einstein Condensate", "publishedDate": "2008-02-20T22:29:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qhOxL6FAhs", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Cate off-lead", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T01:42:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qhsIVPYkks", "description": "Salleh Yaacob - Minah Manja", "title": "Salleh Yaacob - Minah Manja", "publishedDate": "2009-06-09T17:41:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qhtPfrnnYg", "description": "Katherine Araniello turns sentimentality on its head in a playful and absurd re-imagining of a wartime hospital where the wounded and war-damaged wait to have their morale lifted by Matron.", "title": "Oh!

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "science show & innovator mihir kumar panda  8", "publishedDate": "2011-05-20T20:39:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qopaJscxJ0", "description": "Demo 2014\n\nBand members: \nStelios (Guitar, voice, lyrics ).\nAnthemis (Flute, voice).\nThanos (Bass)\nAntonis (Guitar)\n\nProduction:  Kouimtzis Antonis & Stud In Your Mind \nHome studio : Kouimtzis Antonis.\n\nCover by mitsos", "title": "Stud In Your Mind - Purification", "publishedDate": "2014-05-04T19:25:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9qp2ng9jXiY", "description": "http://www.veranda-direct.com/\nVeranda Direct sp\u00e9cialiste de la veranda en kit (\u00e0 monter soi-m\u00eame), a particip\u00e9 au jeu t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \"le Juste Prix\".

Guinness World Records in 2010 named it as the world's most venomous spider. Its bite is apparently thirty times more deadly than that of the rattlesnake. Its scientific name is Phoneutria, the Greek for murderess. It gets its name from its habit of wandering across the jungle floor at night, while other spiders are in their lairs or on their webs. It is sometimes called the banana spider as it likes to hide in the plants during the day. They very rarely reach Britain, from their natural habitat in tropical Central and Southern America.

The portraits are the earliest full-length oil-paintings of North American Aboriginal peoples. Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row (baptized John), Etow Oh Koam (baptized Nicholas), Sa Ga Yeath Pieth Tow (baptized Brant), and Tee Yee Neen Ho Ga Row (baptized Hendrick) are the Chiefs (sachems) who were selected to represent the Iroquoian Confederacy at the royal meeting with Queen Anne. The so-called \"Four Kings\" sought to solidify an alliance with England and military aid against the French. The portraits were probably painted in two stages, a common practice during this era. The details of the face, in particular the tattoos, indicate that the faces were painted from life. The clothing and objects on the other hand were probably completed in the artist's studio from sketches, notes and objects. The Chiefs stand in an imagined North American landscape posed at a slight angle, a pose used by European nobles. They are dressed in scarlet cloaks with gold borders made for them soon after their arrival in London. Items belonging to Iroquois culture are also featured in the portraits. These include their clan totems - the bear, wolf, and turtle- also the belts decorated with moose hair or porcupine quills, the beaded moccasins and the ball club. Tee Yee Neen Ho Ga Row, presented as the top ranking member of the group, is the only one wearing a complete English outfit. His wampum belt, used to commemorate treaties and historical events, shows the importance of his diplomatic position.\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/nouvelles-news/anglais-english/?p=6017", "title": "The Four Indian Kings - Library and Archives Canada", "publishedDate": "2013-09-05T16:42:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9quCzOhKqZk", "description": "See this amazing rendition of the old childhood nursery rhyme \"Who Killed Cock Robin\" - Done By Faun Fables, or more technically Dawn McCarthy and Nils Frykdahl. Amazing musicians, amazing voices. Enjoy! And support the artist by seeing them live and buying a CD or two!\n\nFAUN FABLES is Dawn McCarthy's vivid imagination come to life in song and theater, made to explore human pathos amid an animate earth with musical & physical storytelling forms. It has been attracting a devoted and eclectic following since 1997 with numerous performances throughout North America, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland and four record releases distributed worldwide on Drag City Records: EARLY SONG, MOTHER TWILIGHT, FAMILY ALBUM and THE TRANSIT RIDER.\n\nDawn McCarthy is a writer, singer and theater artist whose work is a sea of gorgeous elemental nitty gritty; haunting melodies, breath, stomping, and natural theatricality led by the voice, rooted in the physical body. It is a crossroads where ancient ballad, art song, physical theater and rock music meet. Her lyrics speak to people of all ages about things like rugged housekeeping, street kids, growing old, sleepwalking and exiled travelers returning home.\n\n *                 *                *                  *                   *                   *                  *\n\n    She was raised in Spokane, WA by two piano players from Chicago and grew up making sounds and dances with a big family of Italian and Irish descent. Her primary education and inspiration came from all kinds of unorthodox and self-taught means. At home her parents played romantic, impressionistic and folkloric melodies via Bartok and Debussy, while older siblings helped develop her taste for rock and experimental music. In New York City, Dawn studied at the School Of Visual Arts and New School for Social Research and cut her teeth as a performer with several adventurous theatrical and musical groups. A solo & musical exploration through Europe plus a fateful meeting with Oakland based entertainer NILS FRYKDAHL began a creative chapter in 1997 that eventually relocated her to the thriving arts community of the Bay Area, California, where she is still currently based.\n\nIn recent times, Dawn has been inspired by studies with Polish theater director WLODZIEMIERZ STANIEWSKI, Action Theater artist CASSIE TERMAN, a primitive skills anthropological workshop called RABBITSTICK,' and singers LOLE MONTOYA, MARIANA SADOWSKA and ROKY ERICKSON.\n\nWWW.FAUNFABLES.NET\n\nAnd visit my website also for some great weird stuff! www.brainphreak.net :)", "title": "Faun Fables - Who Killed Cock Robin (11-20-09 in San Francisco)", "publishedDate": "2009-11-21T22:05:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9quTCZe7wag", "description": "Sushi - Sea Urchin Uni Processing.

In Super Monkey Ball, you don't play as one of four selectable monkeys: AiAi, MeeMee, GonGon, or Baby. Rather, you take control of the levels around those monkeys in an effort to tilt, shift, and roll your ball-bound primate to a marked Goal.\n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/splodinator\nOur whole other channel: http://www.youtube.com/marnax\nThe full list: http://splodinator.com/the-definitive-50-gamecube-games\n\nThe levels start out as simple planes, but devolve into increasingly complex and esoteric shapes, requiring ever more precise mastery of physics to complete.\n\nI am unable to determine what the official story of Super Monkey Ball is. From what I can tell, the titular super monkeys have been trapped inside of hard plastic balls, doomed to roll across hovering green coloured platforms forever. They remind me of vending machine toys.\n\nThe game boasts 10 Beginner, 30 Advanced, and 50 Expert floors. More levels of even greater deviousness are unlockable. For the more social monkeys, multiplayer is available, as well as a number of entertaining mini-games like billiards and bowling.\n\nNot many people know this, but the Monkey Ball franchise actually started out in Japanese arcades. The monkeys, or rather, the levels around them, were controlled by a banana-shaped joystick. Of course, the series only really took off once it hit the Cube.\n\nSuper Monkey Ball has been followed by numerous sequels of widely differing quality. The impeccable Super Monkey Ball 2 expanded upon the formula of the original, and is another stand-out GameCube title absolutely worth checking out. The later Super Monkey Ball Adventure, also available for GameCube, was widely panned.", "title": "Definitive 50 GameCube Game #33: Super Monkey Ball", "publishedDate": "2012-01-12T02:03:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r-WslPBOak", "description": "GEMSTONE:   Hemimorphite\nORIGIN:   Brazil\nWEIGHT (Ct):   2.19\nCUTTER:   Precision hand faceted in Europe by Ravenstein Germany", "title": "V4017.MP4", "publishedDate": "2010-10-10T09:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r-mFcabeq0", "description": "", "title": "Picea orientalis 'Aureospicata' (Golden Oriental Spruce)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-18T07:46:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r0HQSqtXWQ", "description": "Tutaj jest d\u0142u\u017csza wersja tego filmiku plus kilka zdje\u0107 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BGIs5wKc7I", "title": "Nowy Ursus C-380", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T07:45:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r0J_cXhN4E", "description": "My newest coaster!

Bodybuilders prepare for competition through a combination of dehydration, fat loss, oils, and tanning (or tanning lotions) which make their muscular definition more distinct. Well-known bodybuilders include Charles Atlas, Steve Reeves, Reg Park, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno.

Amongst many other black projects, a team of British scientists working at an Infinitum Research experimental station stumbled across some remarkable phenomena involving DNA manipulation. This led to deeper research with dangerously unpredictable results, often leading to human patients losing their lives in irresponsible and immoral experiments.\n\nTime passed on, and by the mid 1990s the failure rate of the experiments had been reduced from 75% to a mere 15%, enough for Infinitum to move onto the next stage: Biological Light Refraction. The British team were hoping to unravel the possibilities of light manipulation to create the perfect covert military agent. Early into the new millennium, due to a gross miscalculation, a series of tests on Subject 617 led to a massive synaptic trauma leaving the patient with multiple genetic anomalies.\n\nThe subject was left in constant pain and with unstable DNA. The subject escaped captivity, killing anyone that got in its way. The I.R.I.S. (Infinitum Research Interception Squad) team have been deployed to return the subject to a maximum security Infinitum Research facility for further study and dissection. The entire project was considered a failure: all funding ceased and development was discontinued while all records and traces of the experiments were destroyed. Infinitum Research denies all knowledge of any form of human DNA manipulation but are more than happy to comment on the possibilities of cloning human organs inside suitable animal donors. It is believed that these organ cloning experiments form the main cover for their human genetic manipulation experimentations.\n\nSubject 617, known as 'The Hidden', must turn the tables and become the hunter instead of the hunted as the I.R.I.S. team close their net around him.\"\n\nDiction: http://www.youtube.com/user/EatMyDiction1\nMax: http://www.youtube.com/user/GassyMexican\nRenee: http://www.youtube.com/user/lolrenaynay\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/SeaNanners\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/SeaNannersPage\nTumblr: http://www.seananners.tumblr.com", "title": "DOLPHIN KILLER (The Hidden)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T16:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r5dHPoOtZw", "description": "http://www.rawnutrition.com/\nWhat's in the box Demonstration Overview of the new Omega NC800HDS Juicer. \n\nBackground Music \u00a9 RawNutritionVideos", "title": "Omega NC800HDS Nutrition Center Juicer Product Overview", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T22:47:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r5i8fQZnug", "description": "Music video by Saigon performing You Make Me Sick (Full-length) Directed by Derek Pike & Saigon. \u00a92010 Suburban Noize Records.\n\"The Greatest Story Never Told\" will finally be told in February 2011.", "title": "Saigon - You Make Me Sick", "publishedDate": "2010-10-27T17:37:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r5wXRuEdew", "description": "Get more mileage out of your favorite graphic tees with 10 different ways to rock them: http://bit.ly/GraphicTees10Ways\n\nShop All Ways: http://bit.ly/Shop10Ways\n\nMusic: Scavenger Hunt - \"Lost\"\nDownload \"Lost\" from Scavenger Hunt for free! \nVisit: http://www.scavengerhuntmusic.com", "title": "10 Ways to Wear Graphic Tees", "publishedDate": "2013-09-12T16:59:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9r62nDb4Vbw", "description": "Read More: http://goo.gl/IQySL\nBEARPAW Women's Boetis II Mid-Calf Boot\n\n  Let your hair down and step out with boldly frazzled attitude in the Boetis II from BEARPAW.

I've seen their photographs in all types of journals, from National Geographic to Discovery Channel. And in advertisements throughout many different industries. And the reason for that is because of their very unique look. Giant red eyes on a frog with orange feet and blue sides is a striking thing to look at. \n\nThey inhabit the Central and South American rainforest. I see these all the time in my travels to Costa Rica. They're actually quite common down there. You'll see them in huge numbers. Actually, you'll hear them before you see them. They have a very unique call. So, they're always hanging out in certain trees, doing their thing, which is hunting for insects at night, and trying to stay alive by staying away from the many animals that use them as prey. \n\nRed-eyed tree frogs are known for their ability to jump, but also they're very, very stealthful in their way that they walk. They don't want to be detected, so they can leap like that, but they also have a tendency to walk. And this is what you see sometimes in the trailers of movies and National Geographic episodes et cetera. You'll see red-eyed tree frogs walking. \n\nWhen they are sleeping during the day, they have to hide all those beautiful colors. So, they will close their eyelid and you will see nothing but a little slit. And it almost looks like a leaf covering their eyes. It's very, very cryptic. Then they hide their toe pads underneath their bodies and they fold in so you cannot see these beautiful markings along the side anymore, and they just disappear. \n\nThey will hang on the undersides of leaves to stay away from predators so they can't be detected. And it's a very effective way of staying alive. They sleep right out in the open, but because of their fantastic ability to hide amongst the leaves and their eyes mimic almost a leaf pattern, they just kind of disappear. \n\nSo, the red-eyed tree frog is an animal that scientists look at, with all tree frogs, as a barometer of how the environment is doing. Frogs are very susceptible to any kind of toxicity. Bad water, bad air, and frogs are really in trouble.

It's that bizarre and terrifying phenomenon of you strange womenfolk getting dressed for a night out. I predict that I could rewrite the entire sodding works of Shakespeare by the time she's picked one bloody dress. (Calling to Woman) Darling, we've got to be gone by 8. Get a bloody move on!\n\nWoman is looking at herself in the mirror.\n\nWoman (mouths): Oh shit.\n\nWoman searches frantically through clothes and looks anxiously at her reflection.\n\nCritic 1: That outfit was a bit of a mistake.\n\nCritic 2 (Gok Wan - see \"Acceptable\"): Everyone knows those colours do not go together. What  was she thinking?\n\nCritic 3: That is actually offensive to look at. It's hurting my eyes!\n\nWoman: Would you shut up please? I'm trying to get dressed.\n\nCritic 1: If you don't want so much attention, why do you draw so much attention to yourself?\n\nCritic 2/Gok: And if you don't want people to comment on the way you dress, you should change the way you dress.\n\nCritic 3: Maybe if you wore something that looked alright people would leave you alone.\n\nWoman: Of course. It's my fault. So all I have to do is follow the rules and I'll be fine. And I should really know what the rules are by now, because I've been listening to them for as long as I can remember.\n\nWoman holds up a mini-skirt.\n\nCritic 1: God, she looks like such a slut!\n\nWoman holds up a long skirt\n\nCritic 2/Gok: What is she, some kind of puritan?\n\nWoman holds up a mid-length skirt\n\nCritic 3: That style does nothing for her figure.\n\nWoman: Right, skirts are out then. Maybe I'll just wear these trousers.\n\nCritic 1: You'd think she'd have made a bit of an effort for the occasion.\n\nWoman (exasperated): Well, what do you want me to wear?\n\nCritic 1: Whatever you like.\n\nCritic 2/Gok: It's up to you.\n\nCritic 3: Choose something you like.\n\nWoman holds up a dress.\n\nCritics (in unison): But not that!\n\nWoman: (Sighs) Right. Think. What would Gok say?\n\nCritic 2/Gok comes up to Woman and puts his arm around her.\n\nCritic 2/Gok: Well, darling, if you wear this top, it will cover up your belly, and make your boobs look bigger.....\n\nCritic 1: Look at the tits on that!\n\nCritic 3: Awww, she looks like she might fall out of that top!\n\nWoman (sharply): I'm not wearing that.\n\nCritic 2/Gok: Well, fine then, if you don't want my advice. What do you want then?\n\nWoman (furious): What I want is to be able to just wear whatever I choose without having to worry that I'm assaulting the senses of the poor innocent people who have to look at me. What I want, is for none of this to be an issue at all.\n\nBoyfriend (from offstage): Come on love, I've re-done Hamlet already!\n\nCritics exit. \nWoman pulls on black jumper.\n\nWoman: Surely nobody could object to that.\n\nBoyfriend enters, and looks at her disapprovingly.\n\nBoyfriend: So, that's it?

The SG Special is Gibson's least expensive bass, priced at $699; the Epiphone is $199.  What do you get for the price difference?  The Gibson comes with a hard case ($120), two T-Bird Plus pickups ($140), Grover Tuners ($60), higher quality electronic components ($40), a nitrocellulose finish (I can't value that), and is made in the USA (sentimental value).  You be the judge, does the Gibson sound $500 better?\n\nAbout the recording:  Recorded through a Tech 21 VT Bass DI straight to the iMac (so no amp).

Danforth Academy boasts of being the school of choice for the upper crust of teen society.\n\nOur four girls, Paige, Abby, Claire and Taylor hail from different backgrounds and economic situations.  While struggling for identity and survival in the most popular of popular schools, they form a friendship and alliance that proves to be beneficial to themselves and the reputation of Danforth Academy, as they are called upon to solve mysteries and expose the perpetrators.\n\nPaige and Claire are the newbies at the school. Taylor and Abby are comfortable in their position as returning students. Sparks fly immediately between Paige and Abby.  Rivalries abound during the first week at Danforth.\n\nHowever when students and faculty suddenly become ill for no apparent reasons, the four girls join forces to solve this and other mysteries that befall Danforth Academy.  Are the culprits Riley and Mia, the mean rich girls? Could it be Emily the principal's eccentric daughter? Maybe it's Sean the nerd, or even Professor Plume the science teacher?\n\nThe girls soon discover that when they join forces, they are a formidable team, and once they put old disagreements aside and combine their strengths, there's no mystery they cannot solve.\n\n(Beginning song: Pass the Note by Pinkeswear)\n(Other music by Britnee Belt. http://www.youtube.com/user/brittneebelt", "title": "Minor Details Trailer", "publishedDate": "2008-12-19T22:25:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9rKhAoX3ok0", "description": "Side shingling equipment in action.", "title": "Sandwich Set Up - Side Shingling", "publishedDate": "2008-10-10T19:50:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9rLLviIpga4", "description": "Die gute alte \u201eguter Cop, b\u00f6ser Cop\" Nummer.\nEr hat immerhin ne Wand mit ner Spraydose vollgesaut.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nProduzenten: Rob, Chris, Dave\nwww.youtube.com/ExplosmEntertainment\nSkript: Davis & Danijel\nSprayer, Leitung, Bearbeitung, Musik, Sounds & Co: 3Dudelsack3 (Davis)\nwww.youtube.com/3Dudelsack3\nJ\u00fcngerer Bulle: DragonDub\nwww.youtube.com/DragonDubSynchro \nSchwarzhaariger Bulle: Ocelot\nwww.youtube.com/Ocelot0070\n\u00c4lterer Bulle: Snoopdoc\n\n--------------------------------------------\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/3Dudelsack3\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/3Dudelsack3\nInfos: http://de.youtube.wikia.com/wiki/3Dudelsack3", "title": "DAS KRANKE VERH\u00d6R - Cyanide & Happiness - Interrogation (German/Deutsch)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T14:20:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9rLOwtnCklo", "description": "Are you working in a trade?

To make cucumber raita you start with some plain yogurt, which I am going to put right into my bowl. Your yogurt can be homemade or you can buy it in a store. I am just going to stir it till it is quite smooth. I am going to add some peeled, grated cucumber right into my yogurt. And I have some chopped mint, which goes really well with the yogurt and the cucumbers. I am going to add that. I am just going to stir it up until it is smooth. A\n\nnd now I am going to do the spicing. So I am going to add a little bit of salt. And because this recipe is not cooked, it is just a fresh salad condiment type of thing, I am going to add toasted cumins because they are already cooked.

Dr. Brantly, who appeared to be in perfect health, called his recovery \u201cmiraculous,\u201d and said thanked those who hoped and prayed for him to survive.\n \nThe other doctor, Dr. Nancy Writebol, has declined to speak with the media, but her husband told news outlets that while she has been weakened by her fight against Ebola, she is was recovering well in an undisclosed location.\n \nDr. Writebol\u2019s husband David Writebol issued a statement reading, \u201cThe lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition.

As the dog starts to wander offscreen, a large punching bag drops from above. He leaps up and hits the suspended bag with his head and body, causing it to swing. The dog repeatedly punches the bag in this manner until he knocks it down completely, grabs it in his mouth, and shakes it from side to side in his teeth.\n\nFrom Edison films catalog: This wonderful dog \"Mannie,\" owned by the vaudeville star, Miss Laura Comstock, is a most learned animal. He has been trained to perform all sorts of tricks, and his intelligence is, perhaps, most marked in his latest and most difficult feat, that of punching the bag. This picture depicts him in a bag punching performance which is really wonderful. His high jumps and lightning-like punches are remarkable and cause one to marvel at the amount of patience that must be necessary to teach a dog such tricks.\n\nCREATED/PUBLISHED\nUnited States: Edison Manufacturing Co., 1901.\n\nNOTES\nCopyright: Thomas A.

The market, populated by traders, work daily to make sure the currencies of different international countries is converted. Traders in the market are successful and profitable if they have the proper knowledge. The information found in this article will help you with making decisions to help you succeed\n\nEvery good forex plan has a well-defined goal. When you reach your goal, you are done trading. Resist any temptation to coast a little further on your success; you are operating without a plan. Once your goal is met and your plan successful, your next job is setting a new goal. Do that before doing more trading.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s0_GMgc_NY\n\nYou should join a Forex forum to learn about strategies and ask questions. Even if you think you know enough about Forex, a forum could be a great opportunity to interact with traders more experienced than you and learn from them. You can also learn about new platforms or software this way.\n\nDon't stop using your demo forex account just because you open an account that uses real money. Learning about the forex markets doesn't stop when you start trading. You can use your demo account to test various configurations of your trading plan, such as to see if you may be too conservative with your stop loss markets.\n\nUse stop-loss order to add some balance to your life. If you don't use stop loss-orders, you will have to watch your account all the time to keep things in control. Additionally, if you don't have deals with a built in stop, you will be in big trouble if you suddenly lose internet connection or electricity or your computer goes down and your trading just goes merrily along without your input!\n\nWhen it comes to forex, make sure that you know your goals to begin with. Then take those goals and make a trading style that is consistent with those goals. Also make sure you know your personality and whether or not you have the stomach to take those big risks or if you should stick to the smaller trades and slowly work your way up. Everybody's style is different and you need to find your trade style in order to truly be successful.\n\nTo make money in foreign exchange trading, it is necessary to check the conditions of a certain currency before making a trade. This can be done by reading various news and political data associated to the country you choose to trade with. A country's currency is usually a reflection of the country itself.\n\nOnce you get the hang of Forex, you may be able to glance at the charts and coast through, but that doesn't mean you should. Like the old adage says about carpentry work: Measure twice and cut once. You always want to double-check everything in Forex, no matter what it is. In fact, a triple-check would be much better.\n\nHard work doesn't mean better pay. Working smart will pay off. Focus on the right education and stick to what works for you. If you see something that doesn't work, move on to the next strategy. Focus and practice on everything that works for you. You will only get better in time.\n\nAs previously stated in the article, foreign currency is traded on the foreign exchange market. The market features many successful traders that work hard to convert currencies and drive the world economy.

They first formed in 1990, releasing the More Than Ever demo tape in 1991. This was quickly followed in 1992 by a split EP with Crisis of Faith and the Life Goes On EP that same year. The band was soon renowned as one of the heaviest in hardcore, drawing ire from some purists for incorporating metal riffage into their sound. Their rise in popularity paralleled that of other vegan straight edge bands such as Earth Crisis and hardline bands like Vegan Reich and Raid. While bands that adhered to Hardline were totally opposed to abortion, Chokehold was vehemently pro-choice. While Chokehold were atheists and radicals with a strongly anarchist streak to their politics, many of the hardline bands were by contrast conservative (expressing belief in a higher power, homophobia, support for the death penalty and prisons and other conservative views).\nIn 1993 Chokehold released the Prison of Hope LP through American label Conquer the World Records (CTW). They released their next record, 1994s Instilled EP, on Philadelphia, PAs Bloodlink Records. This EP featured some of their most powerful and political material to date, notably the anti-religious song Anchor, the anti-homophobia song Mindset, and Burning Bridges, with its hard-hitting lyrics: The corporations are aware where the average person is not, violence against one meat eater is not going to liberate a million animals. You must take action against those who run the industry, not the ones lied to. And to take them down we must use as much fucking violence as they do. Animal liberation, Earth liberation, Human liberation, will only come through education.\nThey followed this in the next year with their second LP, Content With Dying. This album contained by far their most controversial song yet: Not a Solution was possibly the most militantly pro-choice hardcore song since Born Againsts Mary and Child. The liner notes to the song state, to all the militant pro-lifers who couldnt spell life let alone understand it, we salute you with a middle finger. The song is directed at those who identify as pro-lifers, including many vegan straight edge bands at the time, most notably Abnegation. This song in particularly created a huge rift in the vegan straight edge scene. When Chokehold played a show with Abnegation that year, the two bands spent their sets screaming at each other, and they and their fans nearly came to blows. This refusal to back down in the face of significant opposition even within their own subculture typifies Chokeholds uncompromising stance in general.\nThey signed in 1996 to Germanys Mad Mob Records, who unbeknownst to them already had a bad reputation in the European hardcore scene. They recorded four new songs to be released as a split CD with Feeding the Fire, but after a European tour in 1996 the band decided to break up. They played their last show in March at the New Bedford Fest in Massachusetts. These four songs were released as a self-titled EP on Jawk Records the following year.

The largest reserves are found in the USA, Russia, China, India and Australia. Pakistan also has newly discovered large reserves.\n\n By changing various vertical roller mill operating parameters, significant adjustments in the particle size distribution, retention time, and fineness of the finished cement can be achieved. This can help with plant operations as production is switched between different cement types.\n\n The drum is generally divided into two or three chambers, with different size grinding media. As the clinker particles are ground down, smaller media are more efficient at reducing the particle size still further.\n\n Cement can be grinded or crushed by SBM stone crusher. There are many cement mill machines which can greatly improve your production effciency. Here are several cement crusher and cement grinding mill.\n\n These consist of a pair of rollers set 8--30\u00a0mm apart and counter-rotating with surface speed around 0.9 - 1.8 m.s\u22121. The bearings of the rollers are designed to deliver a pressure of 50 MPa or more. The bed of material drawn between the rollers emerges as a slab-like agglomeration of highly fractured particles. The energy efficiency of this process isparatively high. Systems have been designed, including a de-agglomerator and separator, that will deliver material of cement fineness. However, particle size distribution is again a problem, and roll presses are now increasingly popular as a \"pre-grind\" process, with the cement finished in a single chamber ball mill. This gives good cement performance, and reduces energy consumption by 20-40%pared with a standard ball mill system.\n\n \u00a0 Careers | Sitemap | Disclaimer | Privacy Policy | \u00a9  Portland Cement Association - All Rights Reserved\n\n Portland clinker is the main constituent of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add a certain amount of water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. \"Blended cements\" and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.", "title": "cement mill grinding", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T10:56:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sNkwwyRmck", "description": "La fundici\u00f3n 13 de Junio", "title": "Progenitor", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T22:55:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sNoL1w0y7U", "description": "A zoo in southern China releases video showing baby panda triplets opening their eyes for the first time.\n\nFull Story:\n\nThe world's only known surviving set of panda triplets opened their eyes for the first time on Thursday, a Chinese zoo said, releasing video of the baby cubs.\n\nThe video showed the pandas, which were born on July 29 at southern China's Chimelong Safari Park, attempting to crawl, and spending time with their mother.\n\nOpening their eyes represents a major milestone for the animals that are notoriously difficult to breed, the zoo said.\n\nThe zoo has organised a world-wide naming campaign for the three baby pandas with an offer of 110,000 RMB (around $17,828) prize for the winner, organisers said.\n\nDocile giant pandas, native to the mountains and deep bamboo forests of southwestern China, are one of the world's most high-profile endangered species.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Panda Triplets Open Eyes", "publishedDate": "2014-09-19T11:47:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sNtUDE7K8s", "description": "Banana Dream:\n\n100 Calories = 1 medium banana\n80 Calories = 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese ( Light and Lively brand or Aldi brand)\n20 Calories = 1 teaspoon Agave syrup or honey or maple syrup\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nOnly 200 Calories Total!! :) Yippee!!!\n\nTip: Heat it in the microwave for 30-45 seconds for a warm treat on a  winter day :)\n\nCome join me making this quick and easy low cal meal for one!\n\nI eat about 1500 calories per day and work out 4 times per week for one hour and am able to lose weight by eating real food, the recipes are very quick and easy for our busy life styles and I still have room for chocolate and cookies admittedly everyday :) I have lost 10 pounds in 2 months.\n\nThis is not a diet but living sensibly without deprivation.

For men, the rate has risen by 1.7% a year, a total of 18.7% over the same period.\n\u2022 The five-year relative survival rate for melanoma is 90% for Australian men and 95% for Australian women. \nSkin cancer is the most prevalent of all cancers. The main cause is over exposure to sunlight, especially sunburn. Family history is also an important risk factor. In the treatment of any skin cancers, early detection and removal is the best defence. As the sun is the main culprit, the most effective form of protection is to be sunsmart, using sun screen, a hat and shirt whenever possible.\n\n\nNB: It is essential that the medical staff have a clear view of your skin so when attending a skin check please be sure to have NO MAKE UP, SUNSCREEN OR MOISTURISER.\n\nOn your arrivial our friendly reception staff will ensure they have the appropriate personal details required for your visit. (click here to complete form prior to appointment).\n\nYou will then be directed to a waiting area. Once inside the Mole Mapping or Skin Check room the Melanographer or nurse will discuss your history and any concerns you may have. You will then be asked to change into a gown provided and the Mole Map or Skin Check will commence.\n\nAt the end of the map or check a doctor will join you to examine all moles and lesions and discuss appropriate treatment if required. This will include information on costs and post treatment care.\n\nA full Mole Mapping can take up to one hour, a Skin Check consultation will take up to half an hour.\n\nNB: If possible please arrive without make up, sun screen or moisturisor on your skin.\n\nhttp://www.peninsulaskincancercentre.com.au\nMake an Appointment\n\nPhone:\n\n93 Tanti Ave Mornington\n\n5975 9544\n\nor\n\n2/374 Nepean Hwy Frankston\n\n9770 0040\n\nProduced by Westymedia.com", "title": "Skin Cancer    Melanoma in situ", "publishedDate": "2013-08-29T06:47:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sb8Qj4VLjE", "description": "http://www.gistonthis.com\n\nThe quest by actors to produce their own movies is picking up steam as they continue to churn one movie after the other.\nRukky Sanda is out with a new flick and titled this one -- \"Gold Diggin\".

Notice how much smaller Mathew's nose looks following the treatment. This is accomplished completely without surgery, by augmenting the base and lifting the tip reducing the appearance of his dorsal hump. \n\nFor more information on the Non-Surgical Nose Job, see our website at: http://www.botonics.co.uk/treatments/non-surgical-nose-job/\n\nFor a free consultation, please ring, email or submit an inquiry from our website.\n\nTo contribute to our FAQ series, and receive a video response you can leave a comment below, send in an inquiry on our website or email us at info@botonics.co.uk.\n\nThe botonics Plastic Surgery Group\nA: 10 Harley Street, London, W1G 9PF, United Kingdom\nW: www.botonics.co.uk\nE: info@botonics.co.uk\nT: 0845 680 1964\nIDD: +44 845 680 1964\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/b/117049958096368726287/117049958096368726287/about?hl=en\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Botonics/136927523009524?ref=ts\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/botonics\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/botonics/", "title": "Non-Surgical Nose Job", "publishedDate": "2012-12-10T12:12:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sfyYQ5_8y0", "description": "", "title": "kandinski", "publishedDate": "2014-05-09T18:13:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sgSZbav2zw", "description": "Sclafani*Bagni, Sicily ~ A Tour With Conte*Marco | 03 July 2011 ~ #   - IMAG0177.AVI\n\ne` WOW!  That's been Conte's problem as well as ours in trying to find words to describe these photos, which we are editing descriptions as we write.  In the end, we all agree.  No words can portray what the eye sees from this majestic and ancient mountain village that has been lost to time for centuries.  One can only imagine the views enjoyed by two reining Kings, Dukes and Baron's from their North and South castellos.  The acqua zolfata spa water is amazing.  Liquid gold.  When the Ancient Greeks' had Sicily, Sclafani*Bagni was the seat, and they found the thermal zolfata water springs so miraculous they dedicated the springs to the god of medicine \"Aesculapius.\"  A 30-40 minute bath and you do not have to sleep that night.  These holly waters have been curing what ails all for thousands of years.  Conte means to bring the views to your living rooms.

Mirella volgt pati\u00ebnten tijdens behandelingen in het ziekenhuis en in hun thuissituatie. Ze probeert antwoorden te vinden op de vraag voor welke keuzes je als pati\u00ebnt komt te staan, en wat voor nieuwe therapie\u00ebn en ingrepen er mogelijk zijn. Maar ook gaat het in deze serie over hoe je omgaat met je ziekte, wat voor impact de ziekte heeft op je dagelijks leven en dat van je naasten. Artsen, pati\u00ebnten en familieleden vertellen over hoop en teleurstellingen, en over de enorme wil om er samen tegenaan te gaan.\n\nDiabetes\nDe negenjarige Myrthe werd twee jaar geleden opeens heel erg ziek. Binnen de kortste keren lag ze op de Intensive Care. De verpletterende  diagnose luidde diabetes type 1. Daarnaast heeft Myrthe last van hypo-unawareness. Dit betekent dat ze een hypo (te lage bloedsuiker) niet voelt aankomen, zoals normaal gesproken het geval is bij diabetespati\u00ebnten. Myrthe krijgt geen duidelijke lichamelijke signalen die aangeven dat het mis gaat. Hierdoor kan haar bloedsuiker zonder dat ze het door heeft zo laag dalen dat ze buiten bewustzijn kan raken.\nMirella praat met Myrthe, die enorm baalt van haar diabetes en hypo-unawareness. Maar het is heel belangrijk om de acceptatie van haar ziekte te vergroten, zodat het straks goed blijft gaan tijdens haar puberteit.  Daarom doet Myrthe mee aan een speciale bijeenkomst voor kinderen met diabetes in het UMC St. Radboud in Nijmegen.\nDoor de hypo-unawareness kunnen heel gevaarlijke situaties ontstaan. Myrthe's ouders willen dan ook dat er altijd iemand bij Myrthe is als ze dingen gaat doen, maar Myrthe wil juist graag wat meer zelfstandigheid.  Myrthe is geregeld buiten bewustzijn geraakt en met de ambulance naar het ziekenhuis afgevoerd. Gelukkig krijgt ze ondanks de hypo-unawareness langzaamaan beter in de gaten wanneer haar bloedsuiker te laag is, maar nog steeds lang niet goed genoeg.\n\nEdwin heeft sinds zijn zestiende diabetes type 1. Tot zijn twintigste had hij last van hypo-unawareness. Toen hij twintig was, is Edwin 's nachts in coma geraakt, doordat zijn lichaam geen alarmsignalen afgaf toen de bloedsuiker gevaarlijk was gezakt. Een levensgevaarlijke situatie.\nSindsdien heeft Edwins lichaam een verandering doorgaan. Het geeft beter aan wanneer hij een hypo krijgt. \"Alsof mijn lichaam ervan heeft geleerd en een soort alarm heeft bedacht.\" Mirella van Markus praat in deze aflevering met Edwin over diabetes type 1 en hoe hij met deze chronische en ingrijpende ziekte heeft leren om te gaan. Edwin heeft zijn diabetes op dit moment goed onder controle; hij staat middenin het leven, heeft een leuk gezin, interessant werk en in zijn vrije tijd is hij volop bezig met sport en muziek. Sinds kort heeft hij een insulinepomp die het omgaan met de diabetes voor hem nog gebruiksvriendelijker maakt. Maar er blijkt ook uit dat zijn bloedsuikerwaardes nogal schommelen en hier wil hij graag iets aan doen. Niet onbelangrijk, want hoe minder hoge pieken en hoe stabieler deze waardes, hoe minder kans op  schade aan organen.\nInternist en onderzoeker Bastiaan de Galan van het UMC St. Radboud legt uit dat de signalen die Edwin krijgt als er een hypo dreigt te komen anders zijn dan de signalen die gewoonlijk bij een hypo optreden, zoals trillen, zweten of tintelingen in de vingers. \"Zijn signalen zijn miniem, maar hij heeft ze ondertussen weten te herkennen waardoor het alsnog voor hem als signaal werkt.\"\nEdwin doet mee aan een onderzoek naar hypo-unawareness. Het onderliggende mechanisme ervan is onbekend. Waarschijnlijk verandert er iets in de hersenen. Dr. de Galan denkt dat het komt doordat de hersenen te veel melkzuur opnemen. Als melkzuur inderdaad een rol speelt bij hypo-unawareness, brengt dat nieuwe idee\u00ebn dichterbij om de potentieel zeer gevaarlijke hypo-unawareness  te voorkomen.\n\nUitzending: maandag 27 mei 2013, 19.25 uur op Ned1\nWebsite: www.gezond24.nl", "title": "NTR: Over Leven Met...

Part of a documentary that explores of death of a trainer by a killer whale. \n\nAbc's aditi roy is in our l. A. Bureau this morning. \n\nGood morning. Good morning, dan. Seaworld is fighting back against the chargers in the documentary, the company took out a full-page ad in several major newspapers and addressed what it causes dishonesty and misinformation about the seaworld. \n\nSeaworld is lashing back. The company took out a full-page ad in eight major newspapers friday. To quote, set the record straight. \n\n\" The movie black chronicles the story of a killer whale associated with three deaths during 30 years in captivity, including the death of dawn bran choe. This video taken at the seaworld shows the whale playing with the trainer before dragging her into the water. In the open letter, seaworld says we do not capture killer whales in the wild. \nSeaworld said that tilikum did not attack her, that all evidence indicates that tilikum became interested in her ponytail. This documentary seems to have gained more momentum, not less momentum. Reporter: The theme park chain also responded to the documentary's heartwrenching video of whale hunts. \n\nSeaworld's ad said that we do not separate killer whale moms and cavs. It cam after eight musical acts canceled upcoming performances at the orlando theme park.

Here's a question from a man called Tom Lewis in Florida. \n\nTom asks me.  Eric, what should I do about Candida die off?  What can I do to stop feeling terrible?\n\nThat's a good question, Tom.  This is a question I hear many patients tell me; also many practitioners are concerned about the levels of die off that they experience with their patients.  Die off is generally when bacteria die and cell wall fragments are released into the bloodstream and also the immune system can attack Candida and also the metabolizer the Candida produce.  This can come about also through weakened immune response and can make the person feel very washed out and wasted, and some people can aggravate from mild up to severe and debilitating where they can be bedridden for days on end.  It's particularly nasty to have a die off.  And this is again another reason why I don't like people to talk about killing and eradicating and wiping out Candida with all these very powerful types of drugs.  \n\nNystatin, I've written extensively about Nystatin in my book, Candida Crusher, about the side effects from Nystatin.  They can be quite devastating for many people.  If you are a sensitive person, if you know you're sensitive and you react to things, then be careful; use common sense and don't take strong things and go very slowly when you start taking supplements, whether they are antifungals or probiotics or enzymes, go very slowly to start with.  You can avoid most aggravations and most die off.  Even if you're a strong person like me, go easy into treatment.  Step it up over time.  Don't go all hell bent and straight into it.  You're going to get a problem.\n\nSecond thing is, don't undertake anything new like skydiving or bungee jumping or go-kart racing or go on a 20-mile hike or do things like that or start a gym membership when you're trying to treat yourself with a yeast infection.  Take some time out and rest up a bit.  That's good advice.  So give yourself plenty of time to recover and ease yourself into treatment.\n\nThose are two good things that are going to help you avoid aggravation to a large degree.  \n\nThere's a lot more questions that you can check out on my YouTube channel.  If you haven't got the answer to a question, please go to candidacrusher.com and ask me the question.  Subscribe to my channel, that way you're going to be the first one to find out all the new FAQs that come out on yeast infection.  And also go to yeastinfection.org and do my survey.  That way you'll find out what level or degree of severity of yeast infection you've got.\n\nSo I hope that answers your question there.  Thank you.\n\nFor any further questions you can reach me at http://www.candidacrusher.com/contact-me", "title": "FAQ # 125  What Can I Do About Candida Dieing Off?", "publishedDate": "2013-05-29T03:01:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "9sw81_QjleY", "description": "Brand new single from: ATENA\n\"Firstborn\" (2014)\n\nBeheadingTheTraitor:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BeheadingTheTraitor\n\nAtena:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/atenaofficial\nAtena@live.no\nhttp://atenaofficial.tumblr.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ATENA___", "title": "ATENA - Firstborn (Official Lyric Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T21:09:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "9swBnbW6bLE", "description": "\u2022 Breadfruit is a good source of Vitamin C, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6,Vitamin E, B-complex group vitamins,  fiber, Potassium, Iron, Copper, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Selenium,  thiamin, pyridoxine and niacin.\n \u2022 Breadfruit prevent Colon Cancer.\n \u2022 Breadfruit protect the body from heart disease and heart attacks.\n \u2022 Breadfruit is good for diabetes patients.\n \u2022 Breadfruit controls cholesterol.\n \u2022 Breadfruit is good for healthy and strong hair.\n \u2022 Breadfruit is used for removal of dandruff.\n \u2022 Breadfruit is a good source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.

Short circuit is optional but it can cause less mess ups. Barrels are only on two maps, cp_steel and cp_dustbowl. Each barrel has very little health (enough to be destroyed with one regular melee hit). What you must do is use the sticky jumper bombs to push the barrel all the way to the resupply cabinets to the respawn room, and use the fan o war whenever there is a spot that the sticky jumper cannot move the barrel over. Be careful though, the spawn door can break the barrel if it closes on it. Once you get the barrel to the resupply cabinet, change class to engineer, and make sure you have a wrench that is not the gunslinger equipped. Shoot the barrel while on top of it so you fall through and once you become stuck, switch your wrench to the gunslinger. You should end up with no weapon in your third slot. Go outside the spawn room and build a sentry while you have no wrench and then go back to the resupply cabinet to get your gunslinger. The sentry will not be destroyed. Go upgrade it to level 3, pick it up, and place it back down and you will have a level 3 mini sentry. Level 3 mini sentries lock on faster, have a smaller hitbox, and will always appear red no matter what team you are on.\n\nThanks Special:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044023036/", "title": "Tutorial - Mini Sentry lvl3 [Method With Barrel] #3 #TF2 #FIXED", "publishedDate": "2014-06-21T19:57:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9t787iz17jc", "description": "The best builder on Wild Star displays his finer work for public viewing.

Whole life insurance is permanent life insurance coverage that lasts as long as you live and continue to make on time premium payments. The reason that whole life insurance quotes are so much more expensive is due to the fact that the policy will have to pay out a death benefit when you die.\n\nWhole life insurance quotes are available online from many insurance companies that have an online presence. Online life insurance quotes let you search for the policy that best suits your needs. When you log onto each site, you can read the information regarding the whole life insurance policies available and request free quotes. You should request at least three or more quotes so you can compare the different rates.\n\nWhen you compare the whole life insurance quotes you have got, the cheapest is not always the best one to choose. They can be quite affordable because the payment of premiums stretches out over a longer period of time. When you are comparing the online life insurance quotes you receive, you shouldn't just think about the amount of the monthly premium but the length of time that you have to pay the premiums.\n\nWhen comparing whole life insurance quotes there are quite a few things to think about.\n\nFor a website totally devoted to Life Insurance visit Peter's Website Life Insurance Answers and find out about Life Insurance Answers as well as Term Life Insurance and more, including Online Life Insurance and Life Insurance Agents.\n\nhttp://tiny.cc/LifeInsuranceQuotes\n\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Peter_Crump\n\n\nHelpful Tags:\n\n----------------------------------------------\nSearches related to life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance calculator\n\nmanulife life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance quotes\n\nlife insurance companies\n\nterm life insurance rates\n\nterm life insurance\n\nlife insurance rates by age\n\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates\nterm life insurance rates\nwhole life insurance rates\nbest life insurance rates\ncompare life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates by age\nlife insurance rate\naverage life insurance rates\nbest term life insurance rates\ncheap life insurance rates\npermanent life insurance rates\nlife insurance ratings\nlife insurance rate quote\nlife insurance rate chart\nterm life insurance rate\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rate quotes\nlife insurance company ratings\nbanner life insurance rating\nterm life insurance rates chart\nterm life insurance rates by age\nterm life insurance quotes\nlife insurance rate calculator\nlife insurance quotes\nlife insurance quote\nonline term life insurance rates\nterm life insurance\nlife insurance companies\nwhole life insurance quotes\nbest life insurance companies\nwhole life insurance\nbest life insurance\nbest term life insurance rate\ncheap life insurance\nuniversal life insurance\nlife insurance types\nlife insurance quotes online\nsenior life insurance\nlife insurance\nbest term life insurance\nterm life insurance quote\nlife insurance policies\naverage term life insurance rates\nlife insurance cost\naffordable life insurance\n20 year term life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates term\ninstant life insurance quotes\nonline life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates comparison\ntop rated life insurance companies\n--------------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/lifeinsuranceratable\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TermLifeInsuranceify\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLifeinsurancequot\n\nlife insurance rates,life insurance calculator,manulife life insurance rates,life insurance quotes,life insurance companies,term life insurance rates,term life insurance,life insurance rates by age,mortgage life insurance rates", "title": "Life Insurance Rates!

Gingivitis is a form of periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection that destroys the tissues that support the teeth, including the gums, the periodontal ligaments, and the tooth sockets (alveolar bone).\n\nGingivitis is due to the long-term effects of plaque deposits on your teeth. Plaque is a sticky material made of bacteria, mucus, and food debris that develops on the exposed parts of the teeth. It is a major cause of tooth decay.\n\nIf you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar (or calculus) that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become infected, swollen, and tender.\n\nThe following raise your risk for gingivitis:\n\n    Certain infections and body-wide (systemic) diseases\n\n    Poor dental hygiene\n\n    Pregnancy (hormonal changes increase the sensitivity of the gums)\n\n    Uncontrolled diabetes\n\n    Misaligned teeth, rough edges of fillings, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances (such as braces, dentures, bridges, and crowns) Use of certain medications, including phenytoin, bismuth, and some birth control pills\n\nMany people have some amount of gingivitis. It usually develops during puberty or early adulthood due to hormonal changes. It may persist or recur frequently, depending on the health of your teeth and gums.\nSymptoms:\n\n    Bleeding gums (blood on toothbrush even with gentle brushing of the teeth)\n\n    Bright red or red-purple appearance to gums\n\n    Gums that are tender when touched, but otherwise painless\n\n    Mouth sores\n\n    Swollen gums\n\n    Shiny appearance to gums\n\nSigns and Tests:\n\nThe dentist will examine your mouth and teeth and look for soft, swollen, red-purple gums.\n\nThe gums are usually painless or mildly tender.\n\nPlaque and tartar may be seen at the base of the teeth.\n\nThe dentist will use a probe to closely examine your gums to determine if you have gingivitis or periodontis.  \n\nNo further testing is usually necessary. However, dental x-rays may be done to see if the disease has spread to the supporting structures of the teeth.\n\nTreatment:\n\nThe goal is to reduce inflammation.\n\nThe dentist or dental hygienist will clean your teeth. The may use different tools to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth.\n\nCareful oral hygiene is necessary after professional tooth cleaning. The dentist or hygienist will show you how to brush and floss.\n\nProfessional tooth cleaning in addition to brushing and flossing may be recommended twice per year or more frequently for severe cases of gum disease.\n\nAntibacterial mouth rinses or other aids may be also be recommended.\n\nRepair of misaligned teeth or replacement of dental and orthodontic appliances may be recommended.\n\nAny other related illnesses or conditions should be treated.\nExpectations (prognosis)\n\nSome people have discomfort when plaque and tartar are removed from the teeth. \n\nBleeding and tenderness of the gums should lessen within 1 or 2 weeks after professional cleaning and careful oral hygiene.\n\nWarm salt water or antibacterial rinses can reduce gum swelling. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications may also be helpful.\n\nHealthy gums look pink and firm. Strict oral hygiene must be maintained for your whole life, or gum disease will recur.\n\nhttp://www.drueckert.com/general-dentistry/\n\nComplications\n\n    Gingivitis returns\n\n    Periodontitis\n\n    Infection or abscess of the gums or the jaw bones\n\n    Trench mouth\n\nCalling your health care provider\n\nCall your dentist if you have red, swollen gums, especially if you have not had a routine cleaning and examination in the last 6 months.\nPrevention\n\nGood oral hygiene is the best way to prevent gingivitis.\n\nYou should brush your teeth at least twice a day. You should floss at least once a day.\n\nYour dentist may recommend brushing and flossing after every meal and at bedtime. Ask your dentist or dental hygienist to show you how to properly brush and floss your teeth.\n\nSpecial devices may be recommended if you are prone to plaque deposits. They include special toothpicks, toothbrushes, water irrigation, or other devices. You still must brush and floss your teeth regularly.\n\nAntiplaque or antitartar toothpastes or mouth rinses may also be recommended.\n\nRegular professional tooth cleaning is important to remove plaque that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Many dentists recommend having the teeth professionally cleaned at least every 6 months.", "title": "Austin Dentistry | Dental Information: Periodontal Disease | Dentist Austin", "publishedDate": "2012-12-19T22:57:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tEY4oSBtB4", "description": "COS'\u00c8 SWAN / ANTICELLULITE\n\n\u00c8 un'apparecchiatura brevettata, progettata e costruita in Italia con caratteristiche innovative nell'ambito della cura e del benessere del Vostro corpo.\n\nSWAN \u00e8 un meccanismo semplice e sicuro, dai risultati visibili e privo di controindicazioni. \n\u00c8 uno strumento che non solo risolve i problemi evidenti, \nma permette un'azione preventiva alla comparsa dei primi \naccumuli di grasso che pu\u00f2 presentarsi a qualunque et\u00e0.\n\nSWAN \u00e8 efficace per:\n\n\u2022 Trattamento anti cellulite\n\u2022 Rassodamento glutei\n\u2022 Riduzione masse adipose di pancia e fianchi\n\u2022 Trattamento gambe per la tonicit\u00e0 dei tessuti\n\n\nSWAN, grazie all'azione combinata del massaggio effettuato dalle sfere rotanti (che simulano l'azione delle dita della mano, come nel metodo shiatsu) e del metodo vacuum (in sintonia con il vostro ritmo cardiaco) stimola e riattiva il drenaggio veno-linfatico in modo non invasivo, nel pieno rispetto del vostro organismo.\n\nVuoi saperne di pi\u00f9?

Its the home of the swedish model for prostitution, where sale of sex as a service is legal, but purchase is not. It's a country deep in the grip of overt, totalitarian radical feminist rule.\n\nIf you don't know by now, a group of as-yet unidentified Swedish women produced and posted a video on youtube[1] depicting the point-blank shooting murder of a man reading a newspaper. The shooting was staged with the cooperation of the portrayed victim using theatrical blood make-up. The women appeared to enact this fantasy in a state of ecstatic glee. The group of would-be murderous psychopaths identify themselves in the title of their video as SCUM, taken from the title of a famous piece of hate literature by murderer Valerie Solinas manifesto, Society for Cutting Up Men.\n\nThe portrayed murder is followed by the ecstatic giggling of a handful of other females, and an impromptu dance celebration. The woman who apparently shoots a newspaper-reading man appears to have an spontaneous orgasm following the killing. A minor discontinuity in the video shows where most of the orgasm was edited out. Killing a man for no apparent reason than his sex is nothing to hide from the public, but dampening your panties over it apparently is. The short video concludes with the text message \"Do Your Part.\"\n\nWhile the murder is plainly staged, the sadistic glee has every appearance of being genuine. The plain endorsement of murder is also unambiguous.\n\nThat is why A Voice For Men is offering a bounty of 1000 dollars for the confirmed identity of one or more of the individuals in the video. We are asking for the full legal names, home addresses, places of employment, email addresses and contact phone numbers of the women and man who produced and starred in the video described above. We will pay 1000 dollars to any individual who provides and confirms this information, to be payed either directly to themselves or to a charity of their choice.\n\nThis is the second such reward offered for the identity of an individual, the first being a blogger advocating extralegal eugenic modification of men. This blogger has since been identified as the former lawyer and published author Pamela O'Shaughnessy. O'Shoughnessy and her followers no longer enjoy anonymity -- and will be pursued by their own nefarious plans for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe group of swedish women advocating murder -- and staging fantasies of murder in sadistic ecstasy will be publicly identified on this site and on Register-Her.com. Complete details of these individuals names, addresses, phone numbers, government identification numbers, drivers licences, and employers will be permanently published. It is the intent of the editors of A Voice For Men that these individuals be publicly and permanently identified.\n\nSome individuals may criticize the intent to publish not only names, but also addresses, phone numbers, employers and other personal information -- on the grounds that such exposure create a risk of retributive violence against individuals who openly advocate murder based on sex. It is the considered position of the editorial board of AVfM that any such risks are out-weighed by the ongoing hazard to the public of these individuals continuing to operate in anonymity. Open advocation of murder cannot be allowed in a civil society, without that society devolving into a culture of brutal violence.\n\nWritten by\nJohn the Other\n\nTr\u00e5d p\u00e5 Flasback:\nhttps://www.flashback.org/t1720314\n\nhttp://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/activism/1000-bounty-to-identify-swedish-scum-members/", "title": "Society for Cutting Up Men, SCUM", "publishedDate": "2011-11-24T13:35:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tQm2WWoMXo", "description": "This film is a part of report titled \"Complex Herbal Formulations in Traditional Healing of India.\" by Pankaj Oudhia.

The first 10 units have been handed over to the customer today at the main Dacia plant in Mioveni, with the rest of the fleet to be delivered before the end of 2015.\n\nBuilt specifically for OMV Petrom\u2019s needs at Romturingia\u2019s workshop in Campulung Muscel, Romania, the Dacia Duster Pick-Up is based on the current 4x4 production SUV and is powered by the 1.5 dCi diesel engine good for 110PS (109hp).\n\nThe model features a regular cab with two seats and a medium-sized rear window protected by a metal grille. The cabin also features added exterior reinforcements. The bed is 1700mm (66.9in) long and can carry loads of up to 450 kg (992 lbs). The project began at the end of 2012, with a series of prototypes being built before the model was homologated by the Renault Group and the RAR (Romanian Auto Registry).\n\nUnfortunately for those who would like a Duster Pick-Up, Dacia and Renault managing director for Romania, Nicolas Maure, said there are no plans for a customer version. However, I\u2019m guessing nothing can stop those who really want such a model from placing an order directly to Romturingia, after the coachbuilder finishes production of the 500 units for OMV Petrom. Conversion costs are estimated at around \u20ac3,000.\n\nSource: http://www.carscoops.com/2014/10/new-dacia-duster-pick-up-is-real-but.html\n\nNew Dacia Duster Pick-Up Is Real, but Only for Fleet Use.", "title": "New Dacia Duster Pick-Up Is Real, but Only for Fleet Use", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T19:15:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9timdJvudxs", "description": "Cr\u00e9ation en quelques minutes d'une EUL avec Oracle Discoverer Administrator\n\nPour du support vous pouvez nous rejoindre \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec 418-204-1109\n\nou par notre site \npour tout autres technologies BI comme OBIEE, Cognos, Microstrategy \net Tableau Software\nhttp://www.panoramatechnologies.com/#!technologiesbiquebec/cwu5\n\nwww.panoramatechnologies.com\nSp\u00e9cialiste tableau de bord \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et Montr\u00e9al", "title": "Cr\u00e9ation EUL avec Oracle Discoverer", "publishedDate": "2009-01-09T04:58:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tj3UIOTLF0", "description": "4 settembre 2014: intervista al ministro della Semplificazione e della Pubblica Amministrazione.", "title": "Festa Unit\u00e0 nazionale 2014: Marianna Madia", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T19:25:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tjUjUwRiSc", "description": "AUX TANK PART 2", "title": "MICHAEL HEIT:  AUX TANK PART 2", "publishedDate": "2009-09-21T04:48:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tk9zt9VpG8", "description": "SunFest Light the Night for the Leukaemia Foundation in Sunbury 2011.\nPromotion Day at Barry Plant Real Estate Sunbury.\nRegister NOW at www.sunfest.org.au", "title": "SunFest Light the Night for Leukaemia in Sunbury 2011.m4v", "publishedDate": "2011-09-13T00:36:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tkAg9SDaqw", "description": "G\u0435t a gr\u0435at d\u0435al \u043en \u0430maz\u043en.\u0441\u043em http://bit.ly/1jaaEkM  \n\nDigital Micro Spy\nSometimes we need to record information without revealing it.

City officials said that's as much snow as they normally see in an entire year.\n\nDriving was banned on many roads and 140 miles (225 km) of the New York State Thruway along Lake Erie and Lake Ontario were closed.\n\nThe storm inundated some areas, with snow falling at a rate of 5 inches (13 cm) per hour, while sprinkling only a few inches (cm) just a few miles (km) away, according to meteorologists at the National Weather Service and local residents.\n\n\"This is the worst I've seen,\" said Buffalo resident Haken Logan, as his children jumped off the porch of his home into a giant snowdrift. \"It's bad, but not as, if you go a couple, probably about 10 blocks over, it's a lot worse but it's pretty bad here as well. We're making the best of it, though.\"\n\nThe disparity is typical of the so-called lake effect, which occurs when cold air moves across the relatively warm Great Lakes, drawing in moisture and dropping snowfall onshore, Thomas said. The phenomenon can create intense squalls but leave nearby locations virtually unscathed.\n\nAs bad as the storm is, one long-time resident said she's seen worse.\n\n\"It's not as bad as 1977,\" said Darlene Gubala, \"but it's pretty bad, especially with all the shutdowns and bans and everything, so it's a little bit harder for people to get around.\"\n\nIn south Buffalo, snowmobiles were being used to respond to emergency medical calls and rescue stranded motorists while some 5,000 tons of snow was removed from the area, Buffalo officials said at a news conference.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for 10 counties, deploying National Guard troops to help residents.\n\nTo the west, ice on the Mississippi River from the cold blast forced the earliest winter closure of the shipping season on records which date back to 1969, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.\n\nAt least seven deaths were attributed to the storm in the Northeast. Of those, the Erie County Sheriff's Department said a 46-year-old man was found in his car buried under about 15 feet (4.6 meters) of snow while another victim died in a traffic accident and three people died from heart problems.\n\nErie County's health commissioner said an elderly man with a cardiac condition died when he could not be transported to a facility that could provide the care he needed.\n\nThere were no details available about the seventh death.", "title": "USA - New York - Snow - Weather  19.11.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T13:31:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9toH-4hwWAI", "description": "at Gold 5 Jan http://www.ltresses.com", "title": "Van ... knee length hair perfectly trimmed and thick", "publishedDate": "2008-01-01T18:14:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "9toKB95JoFo", "description": "This album is fucking expensive! but if you want to buy it you can do so here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Forever-Malcolm-Young-Frenzal-Rhomb/dp/B000JLQOZK\n\nSupport these awesome bands and help keep punk rock alive!\n\nDisclaimer: I do not support pirated music, I support the spread of amazing music through any means possible.

Thanks for all the comments! This is what I used to do a couple of years back, and that also it is shot so nicely, that I thought it befitting to show all. \n\nUPDATE.\nI have received a ton of requests regarding this video  - mainly about how to get into the job. Well, the only way is to start at the bottom by becoming a trainee linesman with a power company. It is essential to have an understanding of Electrical engineering so a degree in this subject is a must have. You will have to work yourself up the ladder, demonstrating an understanding of risk and safety aspects, but most of all an ability to always be relaxed around all electrical distribution systems. Spider says it very well - \"... it is not a job for a hot duck\". \n\nAfter working you way up the ladder and proving yourself, the training can be intensive and laborious, and after many experiences in a laboratory setting having experienced the feeling of high voltage passing around you and learning to identify what feels right and wrong, you can go and train for your certification for EHV transmission systems. After this, it is more training which continues until you are experienced enough to teach the next generation.\n\nYes - it can be considered dangerous in several ways. In the words of one of my mentors, \"You will only make a mistake once Simon\".\n\nSome quick answers - \nSuits - Made by DuPont to application specific requirements. \nPay - GBP40-70k dependent on experience, certification etc\nThe two lines are at the same potential in the video carrying one phase at 500kv\nLines go up to 765kv, but there are plans to go as high as 925kv from what I read (I am not in this business any more). Although there are lines working at over 1MV DC.\nYou cannot get life insurance.\nIt is not as glamorous as it appears.\nFor all the people who posted technical questions - do not believe everything that is posted as comments (although some is correct). The arcing between helicopter and line is the helicopter becoming the same potential as the line (air is the dielectric whos insulating properties break down when an object at zero potential comes within the break down point and is potential dependent), remembering that the line voltage is passing through 0v 100 times per second (or 120 times per second if you are on the other side of the Atlantic) meaning that the arc is struck that many times until the potential is equalized through the rod or bonding clamp.\n500,000v is the phase to phase potential, whereas the phase to ground potential is around 288,600v.\n\nClip is from IMAX documentary called \"Straight Up\", and grabbed from HD source.", "title": "High Voltage Cable Inspection", "publishedDate": "2007-03-08T23:31:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tzlAhbC9C0", "description": "JSU Marching Southerner's sing \"I'll Fly Away\"", "title": "JSU Marching Southerner's sing \"I'll Fly Away\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T02:27:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9tzrdc-t0PY", "description": "Have you tried to get a straight answer from a Ssocial Media consultant about what they can ACTUALLY do for your business?

Not on these shores anyway. Like Angelique \u2018Frenchy\u2019 Morgan.\n\nCBB will always be on hand to reassure us that this individual is in fact famous, for some reason.\n\nLet\u2019s find out more about Angelique\u2026\n\nAge: 38\n\nAge she is trying to pull off: 21\n\nOccupation: Former exotic dancer, reality TV personality, actress and model.\n\nSo she\u2019s a jack of all trades, if that trade consists of removing ones clothes or handing in her dignity at the door.\n\nHer TV appearances include Rock Of Love, Charm School and I Love Money. If you\u2019ve ever had the misfortune of watching any of these you will understand.\n\nAngelique also has a few adult films under her belt and was most recently Radio hosting and TV hosting for a local Las Vegas channel.\nPersonality: A mix of Jasmine Waltz, Courtney Stodden and uhh\u2026 Gillian McKeith? Angelique has a reputation for being something of a wild party animal but contradicts this by being both a non drinker and non smoker. If she is as crazy as she says she is then it\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nShe also has a spiritual side to her, possessing a Health Coaching Licence and believing in the use of herbal remedies rather than traditional medicines. If anything is going to test that commitment to the limit, it\u2019ll be CBB.\n\nIf she has to sit between George Gilbey and White Dee in full conversational flow she\u2019ll be begging for a paracetamol.\n\nAngelique is also very passionate about her charity work and supports many groups in the fight against animal cruelty.\n\nShe\u2019ll have to keep a close eye on Ricci Guarnaccio and Lauren Goodger then because last time I checked they didn\u2019t qualify as members of the human race.\nWhat will she bring to the house?\n\nConfident, loud and bubbly, she will bring energy and enthusiasm to CBB. Her time spent in Vegas, with Playboy and on various TV shows will give her plenty to talk about.\n\nI expect her to throw herself into every task and make the absolute most of her time in the house as with her type of celebrity the bubble may burst at any point. Her CBB experience will be one long audition to prolong her celebrity career and she won\u2019t want to blow it.\n\nWill she be involved in drama?\n\nThere is no evidence she is attached in the outside world so there could be a possibility of romance. Ricci is going to be like a dog on heat in there and though she might not be his first choice the classless Geordie may well end up trying it on with her.\n\nThere are some big personalities and potentially bitchy individuals in there but you\u2019d hope that at 38, Angelique will be mature enough not to get involved in such matters, only time will tell.\n\nCan she win?\n\nCBB fans often don\u2019t want warm to American imports but I think she\u2019ll fare ok. Angelique to make it to finals night but finish fifth or sixth behind eventual winner Edele Lynch.\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Slideshow Creator (http://www.youtube.com/upload)", "title": "Who is Celebrity Big Brother\u2019s exotic dancer Angelique \u2018Frenchy\u2019 Morgan?", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T03:41:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "9u0T7WQ_w-E", "description": "Hello there everyone!

Swift's Ultra-Violet/Optical telescope snapped more than 28-hundred individual shots which astronomers used to produce the 160-megapixel mosaic of the LMC and the 57-megapixel mosaic of the SMC. The mosaics will enable astronomers to better study the evolution of stars in each galaxy.  Meanwhile, astronomers say celestial conditions in October 2014 and February 2016 will present prime opportunities for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to hunt for Earth-sized planets around the red dwarf Proxima Centauri, the star nearest to our sun. When Proxima Centauri passes in front of two other stars during those two time periods, astronomers plan to look for any imaging distortion -- called microlensing. Microlensing occurs when a foreground star passes in front of distant star and could indicate the existence of smaller planets.

In addition, it can accept input from a 3.5mm aux cable (included), and is splash and shock proof (the \"splash proof\" is standard-defined, the shock proof is claimed).\n\nThis speaker is charged from a powered USB port via an included cable. It accepts audio inputs from both Bluetooth sources or a wired 3.5mm aux input on the speaker bottom.\n\nPROS:\n-Very nice sound.

Geburtstag auf Lebenszeit. \nDieses durchaus massiv ausgelegte Geb\u00e4ude besteht nur teilweise aus Holz. \nDa es f\u00fcr Goebbels' Bed\u00fcrfnisse bald nicht mehr ausreichte, lie\u00df er westlich des Sees, in einiger Entfernung vom Ufer, bis 1939 nach einem Entwurf von Heinrich Schweitzer unter Federf\u00fchrung des Architekten Hugo Constantin Bartels einen neuen Landsitz errichten.\n\nDas Hauptgeb\u00e4ude mit Walmdach und Natursteinsockel hatte 30 Zimmer mit einer Grundfl\u00e4che von 1600 m\u00b2. Dazu kamen ein Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4ude und ein G\u00e4stehaus mit Besprechungszimmer, in dem auch SS-Wachmannschaften untergebracht waren, und 1944 ein Hausbunker. Das Landhaus war mit einem eigenen Wasser- und Kl\u00e4rwerk,einer kaum sichtbaren Klimaanlage, einem Kino, nach unten versenkbaren Fenstern und einem Zimmer mit zwei Kaminen ausgestattet. \nDie UFA trug 1,5 Millionen Reichsmark zum Bau bei. Das Landhaus wurde auch zu einem beliebten Treffpunkt von K\u00fcnstlern und Schauspielern wie Zarah Leander, Emil Jannings oder Heinz R\u00fchmann. \nDie Kinder der Familie besuchten die Schule im Dorf Wandlitz, wohin sie mit einer Kutsche gebracht wurden.\n\n1946 bis 1990:\n\nAlle Geb\u00e4ude wurden nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges bis 1946 als Lazarett genutzt.\nT\u00e4glich reisten Offiziere der vier Alliierten aus Berlin an, um auf dem zu Berlin geh\u00f6renden Territorium ihre Fahnen zu hissen und abends wieder einzuholen. \n\nAm 9. M\u00e4rz 1946 wurden das Gel\u00e4nde und die Geb\u00e4ude von der Sowjetischen Milit\u00e4radministration in Deutschland (SMAD) an die erst zwei Tage zuvor am 7. M\u00e4rz gegr\u00fcndete Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) \u00fcbergeben, die dort ihre Jugendhochschule Waldhof am Bogensee einrichtete.\n\nIm Landhaus wurden ein Kindergarten, eine Konsum-Verkaufsstelle, ein Friseur sowie Wohnr\u00e4ume f\u00fcr Direktor und Verwaltungsleiter untergebracht.\n\n\n\nFotos: nihilreich ( ausser Klein \"Heide\" )\nMusik : Heimat deine Sterne", "title": "Waldhof Bogensee, Goebbels Villa,  Landhaus, Bunker Familie Goebbels 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-08-25T22:35:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9uTklvXl57M", "description": "In this video, I show you the steps I take to create my winged eyeliner.

Each leg of the front main fork or of the back main fork can have inside a telescopic shock- absorber and the behavior of the vehicle(with 3 or 4 wheels) in curve or in straight motion is regular, because the 2 back forks-wheels follow the same kind of inclining and pass on the the same drive tracing whithout sliding. The inclining and steering System is made to obtain the Tricycle (with 2 front wheels and 1 back wheel) or also the Quadricycle(with another incliningSystem, with 2 other back wheels) The 2 front wheels can have or not the 2 usual fork.; It could have the 2 vertical axles externally mounting the front 2 wheels.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that a little over ninety two percent of registered nurses are female. For that reason, lots of RNs have likely been through giving birth and will relate with a Neonatal Nurse.\n\nIn fact, any woman who has given birth in a hospital in the past half century likely received care from a Neonatal Nurse. Neonatal Intensive Care Units didn't become part of hospitals until the 60s. Now, these are seen in just about every hospital within the United States.\n\nAs a Neonatal Nurse, you will be doing work in a variety of different settings for example medical clinics, pediatric offices, ERs, where you will be giving care to newborns. You'll be able to administer medications, initially read the results, monitor vital signs, order tests and even train new mothers how to take care of their newborns.\n\nYou'll also need to be capable of providing specialized care to mothers and babies who have gone through a C-section More often than not, Neonatal Nurses will be helping babies that are either preterm, or are under the age of two.\n\nIf being a Neonatal Nurse in a setting of a hospital is your objective, then you will work in one of three different types of newborn nursery facilities:\n\nLevel I: provide  to healthy  babies.\nLevel II: take care of premature or ill babies.\nLevel III: treat newborn babies with critical health issues.\n\nA Level III nursery is typically found in larger hospitals or children's hospitals. A Level three  nurse is also referred to as a NICU Nurse. They're going to attend to patients that Level I and II are not equipped to take care of. Therefore, as a Neonatal Nurse you might be taking care of babies who are perfectly healthy, or for mothers and/or newborns battling with serious health complications.\n\nRNs looking to work in this career will have to earn a Master's Degree from a neonatal nurse practitioner training program. The undergraduate part of the degree doesn't need to be specialized.\n\nBefore you can sign up for the Master's degree program, you are going to first have to earn a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree You need not be licensed to join a master's degree program, for the reason that a lot of graduate programs only require that applicants qualify for licensure.\n\nThe program will  prepare individuals to deal with infants. During training, nurses learn about those illnesses common in newborns and the treatment for those disorders. A portion of the training will also involve clinicals in local neonatal units.\n\nThe required classes will include stuff like neonatal care, fetus physiology and pediatric pharmacology, as well as healthcare system basics. Should you sign up for a web-based masters program, you are going to take clinicals onsite at a local medical facility.\n\nRequirements with regard to continuing education can vary among states.\n\nThe National Association of Neonatal Nurses sponsors online conferences for those who need additional education after becoming a Neonatal Nurse.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_WYiM6hGQ", "title": "Becoming a Neonatal Nurse", "publishedDate": "2011-10-21T17:59:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9u_v9H24PfY", "description": "From Infinity Rock Explosion!
