The piece is written for solo violin and orchestra. The opera was first premiered at the Opera Garnier in Paris on March 16, 1894.\n\nThe intermezzo, in the 18th century, was a comic operatic interlude inserted between acts or scenes of an opera seria. These intermezzi could be substantial and complete works themselves, though they were shorter than the opera seria which enclosed them; typically they provided comic relief and dramatic contrast to the tone of the bigger opera around them, and often they used one or more of the stock characters from the opera or from the commedia dell'arte. In this they were the reverse of the Renaissance intermezzo, which usually had a mythological or pastoral subject as a contrast to a main comic play. Often they were of a burlesque nature, and characterized by slapstick comedy, disguises, dialect, and ribaldry. The most famous of all intermezzi from the period is Pergolesi's La serva padrona, which was an opera buffa that after the death of Pergolesi kicked off the Querelle des Bouffons.\n\nThe intermezzo was the single most important outside operatic influence in Paris in the mid-18th century, and helped create an entire new repertory of opera in France (opera comique).\n\nJules (\u00c9mile Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric) Massenet (May 12, 1842  August 13, 1912) was a French composer best known for his operas. His compositions were very popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and he ranks as one of the greatest melodists of his era. Soon after his death, his style went out of fashion, and many of his operas fell into almost total oblivion. Apart from Manon and Werther, his works were rarely performed. However, since the mid-1970s, many of his operas such as Esclarmonde, have undergone periodic revivals.\n\nThis piece is as all my classical favourites, proper chillout mood music.

The 11 species of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel) and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus european), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae. Badgers include the species in the genera Meles, Arctonyx, Taxidea and Mellivora. Their lower jaws are articulated to the upper by means of transverse condyles firmly locked into long cavities of the skull, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals. Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be 46--51 cm long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured stomachs. They grow to around 90 centimetres in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around The diet of the Eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms, insects, grubs, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. funny animal animals crazy craziest insane blooper bloopers fail fails dam dams beaver beavers rodent rodents danger dangers rabid rabies disease diseases diseased swim swims swimming swimmer swimmers water waters waterfall waterfalls falls niagra ontario canada cottage cottages country cute cutest cub cubs mice mouse rat rats bite bites attack attacks hunt hunts hunter hunters hunting cook cooking eat eats eating cooks fire trap traps trapping pest pests snare snares fish fishing fisher fishers fisherman fishermen weasels, stoats, ferrets and otters They also eat small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, as well as roots and fruit. In Britain, they are the only predator honey rock of hedgehogs, which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories. In some areas they are known to predate lambs, and may bite a ewe defending her lamb, almost always leading to infection of the bite. They are occasional predators of domestic chickens, and are able to break into enclosures that a fox cannot. In southern Spain, badgers feed to a significant degree on rabbits. The honey badger of Africa consumes honey, porcupines and even venomous snakes (such as the puff adder); they will climb trees to gain access to honey from bees' nests. American badgers are fossorial carnivores -- i.e. they catch a significant proportion of their food underground, by digging. They can tunnel after ground-dwelling rodents at speed. Badgers have been known to become intoxicated with alcohol after eating rotting fruit. Hunting badgers has been common in many countries. The Dachshund dog breed was bred as a badger hound; Dachs is the German word for badger The blood sport of badger-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, and the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 made it a serious offence to kill, injure or take a badger, or to damage or interfere with a sett unless a licence is obtained from a statutory authority. An exemption that allowed fox hunters to loosely block setts to prevent chased foxes escaping into them was brought to an end with the Hunting Act 2004. Badgers can be fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, are capable of fighting off dog-packs and fighting off much larger animals, such as wolves and bears. However, badgers can be tamed and then kept as pets Today, badgers are commercially trapped for their pelts, which are used to make shaving brushes and clothing. Badger hair is particularly suited for shaving brushes due to its water retention. Virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in three grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiplied to the point of becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and process their hair", "title": "Cute dog goes badger hunting!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T17:07:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "6gJXiHIdOWk", "description": "http://www.suamimacho.com/ Vimax diperbuat 100% dari herba terpilih semulajadi.

In one clip, he dances to his own song. The intended audience is cage-mate, Chulo, who plays with a toy in the first clip and dines happily in the second.  \n\nI'm guessing this is Bucky's version of the \"Friendship Song\" Chulo whistles in the COCKATIEL SONG AND DANCE TEAM video. Both are happy, rhythmic pieces in Major keys; they inspire a similar dance; and they seem to be social or \"courtship\" songs of some type. \n\nBucky's tuning wavers and his tonal center shifts (the first clip starts in B-flat), but in both performances he ends in roughly the same key, settling in around A-flat Major both times (Chulo's song is in B-flat). \n\nBucky's music, like Chulo's, involves repetition and inflection of skeleton melodies. The phrases get quite regular and rhythmic at times, and there is a happy, friendly overall feeling - so I call this song an Allegro. \n\nDespite similarities to Chulo's song, this is Bucky's musical voice. Besides whistling in a distinct key, he invents or chooses different themes and puts them together differently than Chulo does. And he has a unique way of spinning out an embellished line.  \n\nIn Bucky's song, especially in the first clip, the wolf whistle is woven in very creatively. It's used as a theme or motive, inflected various ways to construct melodies; but it also serves as a boisterous refrain, punctuating a series of short, melodic episodes. Usually at each refrain, the wolf whistle is repeated 2-4 times. After about 1:20 the song shifts mood into something harder and more urgent - this is probably a transition into a new song. \n\nIn the second clip (which starts around 1:34), Bucky's whistling moves into a semi-cadence, which he extends from about 1:47 to 1:53. At 1:54 he launches into an assertive, rhythmic section with an obvious skeleton melody. He riffs over this same short melody (or tries to) with various embellishments for two and a half repetitions, but at the end of the third, starting around 2:17, he hovers on the penultimate \"chord\" (in effect, over the dominant or V chord) and strings this out, riffing over it 7 times, repeating and varying his melodic embellishments, before falling back half-heartedly into the tonic (A-flat) at 2:35. \n\nWe did not teach Bucky any of this music. Where he originally learned its musical elements seems less important than what he does with them now, which must be considered his own creation - whether you call it an \"improvisation\" or something else.\n\nNote: Paco (blue-crowned conure, off-screen) calls out to his flock-mate at 0:07.", "title": "Bucky's Serenade", "publishedDate": "2008-09-27T02:37:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6h7tzDtr1Sc", "description": "Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced that his country's 2015 budget will largely be invested in the Electric, Hydraulic, and Hydrocarbon sectors of the country in the hopes that increased productivity in said sectors will provide the resources for much needed social investment in the country.

The most important ones among them were distilleries and breweries. The owner of Saku manor, German earl Karl Friedrich Rehbinder also decided to establish a brewery at his manor. It has been proven with documentary evidence that the first production period at the Saku beer house was in October 1820.\n\n\nSaku Originaal is a light high-quality beer with a mild taste and pleasant aroma, which Saku brews of its own yeast, water, and selected malt and hops.\n\nSaku Originaal is Estonia's first on beer of the new era, which came on sale in 1993. With its innovative attitude, Saku Originaal has always been an active player in the Estonian beer market, a creator of new packaging and taste trends. The leading local beer is today the most popular beer brand in Estonia, \"The Right Estonian Beer, which expresses the characteristics, life and dreams of Estonian men. \n\nThe alcohol content of Saku Originaal is 4.6% of volume, and the recommended serving temperature is 6--8 \u00b0C.\n\nSHARKY:::\nhttp://youtube.com/PitBullSHARKY\nhttp://twitter.com/pitbullsharky\nhttp://facebook.com/pages/PitBullSharky/286186765138\nhttp://uniteddogs.com/en/dog/PitBullSharky\nhttp://www.istardom.com/PitbullSharky\npitbullsharky (at) gmail.com\n\n\nHELEN:\nhttp://youtube.com/HelensVlogs\nhttp://youtube.com/texasgirly1979\nhttp://twitter.com/texasgirly1979\nhttp://myspace.com/texasgirly1979\nhttp://zazzle.com/texasgirly1979\n\nMAX-ARTHUR:::\nhttp://youtube.com/MAXtheRoombaCAT\nhttp://twitter.com/MAXtheRoombaCAT\nhttp://myspace.com/maxtheroombacat\nhttp://facebook.com/pages/MAXtheRoombaCAT/105538709493779", "title": "OMG Laptop Drinks BEER!!!

Instead of using a recognizable image with distinct subject areas, the Baffler's designs are abstract. Furthermore, each piece is a single color and oddly shaped. The Baffler's puzzle tray provides you with your only clues for beginning the jigsaw.\n\nAll three puzzles are 7.5 inches square and range in piece count from 67 to 78. Despite the relatively small number of pieces, each Baffler will take 30-45 minutes to solve. Unlike a traditional jigsaw puzzle, the Baffler is meant to be solved over and over.\n\nAvailable in three styles: The Nonagon, the Spiral of Archimedes, and the Bindu Truss. \n\n**********************\n\nTo check out the latest curiously awesome products from Vat19.com, click here: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/showproducts.cfm?action=new&adid=youtube \n\nFor the most popular items on Vat19, click here: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/showproducts.cfm?action=popular&adid=youtube", "title": "The Baffler Jigsaw Puzzle", "publishedDate": "2011-02-19T03:20:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hEfLmqShoE", "description": "DisneyCarToys Barbie Baby Birth Story with Doctor Elsa.

Luckily we have  gorgeous plants for your fall color. The Winterberry holly, or Ilex verticillata if you like botanical names.  There are several varieties, but some of the more commonly seen winterberry hollies in the northeast  areas are:\n'Winter Red' -- a prolific berry producer that grows to 6 to 8 feet\n'Red Sprite' -- a dwarf variety that stays to around 2 to 4 feet\n\n\n\n\nWinterberry occurs naturally in swamps, roadside ditches, and other poorly drained areas, often growing with the entire root system submerged for most of the year. This makes Winterberry a good choice for planting in poorly drained areas of the landscape. It also grows well in ordinary garden soil, but best growth and fruiting occurs when the plants do not experience drought.\n\nDeer seldom damage winterberry hollies. In general, damage from browsing is most severe when snow cover or extreme cold has reduced food availability. Another problem time is early spring when young succulent growth of ornamentals provides attractive browse before other spring growth is avialable. When food is in short suply, deer will browse even the most undesirable plants.\n\n \n Landscape Design, Horticulture, Landscape Design, Maryland Landscape Design, Northern Virginia Landscape Design, Virginia, Landscape, Design Tagged With: alexandria landscape design, arlington landscape design, bethesda landscape design, clifton landscape design, culpeper landscape design, dc landscape design, fairfax landscape design, falls church landscape design, fallscaping, fauquier county landscape design, fredericksburg landscape design, gainesville landscape design, great falls landscape design, ilex verticillata, leesburg landscape design, northern virginia landscape design, Virginia plants, winterberry holly", "title": "Deer and Winterberry Hollies", "publishedDate": "2013-09-27T23:27:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hHjctqSBwM", "description": "The poem is read by Sylvia herself.", "title": "Sylvia Plath Reads 'Daddy'", "publishedDate": "2006-12-29T18:14:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hIffXPIf84", "description": "Chris and Patrick wanted to share the love so they decided to Hug random people!\nLinks Below :)\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/cpvoros\nKeek:   www.keek.com/vorostwins\nInstagram www.instagram.com/vorostwins\n\nComment, Like, Share!", "title": "Hugging Strangers", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T15:55:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hIj0nR-NSg", "description": "", "title": "Giant pimple on my ear lobe..

Gordon implores MBA students to focus first on applying their passions toward solving the biggest problems rather than making the most money. Gordon references a young Bill Gates and how that problem solving - getting a computer in every home - translated to later career philanthropic efforts.

Last July, fittingly, he was elected president of Local 2627\u2014the union representing New York City Electronic Data Processing Personnel.\n\nHe also happens to be a BMCC graduate.\n\nA road warrior comes home\nDischarged from the military toward the end of the Vietnam War, Ajaye spent several years driving tractor trailers. The pay was good, but my female companion was unhappy that I was always on the road, he recalls.  I needed to find a way to make a living without being away all the time. \n\nIt was 1983. Ronald Reagan was in the White House, E.T. won the Oscar for Best Picture, and computers were transforming the world. Ajaye found himself drawn to a career in technology but knew hed need a college degree to get very far. The school nearest to his midtown apartment was BMCC, then located in the Times Square area, although by the time he enrolled, the campus had moved downtown.\n\nAs a student, Ajaye worked as the micro-labs coordinator of the colleges Learning Resource Center and later in the administrative computer center. Following his graduation in 1986, he earned his BS degree at York College and went to work for the city.\n\nRising trajectory\nI remember feeling that I needed a better understanding of my benefits package, so I started attending meetings of Local 2627, he says.  He soon became immersed in union activities and helping newcomers find their bearings; after being hired at BMCC, he was elected a shop steward.\n\nBack then, there were 11 members of Local 2627 at the college, he says.  Now we have 25.  As Ajaye  gained experience, visibility and broad support, his trajectory continued to rise. He was appointed the unions executive board, was later elected a first vice-president, and became president last summer.\n\nAs president, Ajaye has an active role in all contract negotiations with the city and makes sure the rights of union members are protected.  Ill personally represent union members at disciplinary hearings, or when they file grievances\u2014typically when they believe their salary isnt aligned with their title, he says. From a professional standpoint, he adds, Local 2627 is the most diverse unit in all of DC37, the citys 121,000-member municipal workers union. We have members in 88 city agencies and at 314 locations, from transportation to environmental protection to the board of ed.\n\nTangible rewards\nA man of easy affability and good humor, Ajaye takes his responsibility to Local 2627 members very seriously.  When you work for an organization 30 or 40 years, you want to have something to show for it\u2014good health benefits, a decent salary, and a defined pension plan that isnt vulnerable to market swings,  he says.  BMCC, he adds, has been an exemplary employer.\n\nWorking conditions here are excellent, Ajaye says.  The administration has shown itself more than willing to make sure that our members have the opportunity to grow\u2014in terms of their knowledge, profession and salary.

Dr. Asali noted that Amb. Oren did not mention the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in his presentation. Dr. Asali also asked Amb. Oren what advice he would give the Israeli government on how to move forward on the peace talks.\nBelow is a video clip and a transcript of Dr. Asali's interaction with Amb. Oren.\n\n\nTranscript:    \n\nAmbassador Michael Oren: \"Here's my friend Ziad... Hope you have something about the Palestinian issue, because no one said anything about the Palestinian issue. Please.\"\nZiad: \"That's my point!\"\nAmbassador Michael Oren: \"Okay, good!\"\nZiad: Welcome back, welcome back to Washington Mike, it is, it is really a statement of the time and it's nevertheless fascinating that you went through the whole discourse of yours without really mentioning much about the Palestine-Israel conflict. Even omitting the only part of the US policy that is intensely engaged in the Middle East at this time, with negotiations over Palestine, Israel. Now that you are out of office, and free to speak your mind...you've done some of that and I've noticed, but...would you care to tell us what kind of an advice you would give the present Israeli government, not the American government, as to how best to maneuver from now on.\"\nAmbassador Michael Oren: \"Well let me say that, first of all, it's... it's great to see you Ziad. I mentioned that the inability of the United States to bring about a resolution of the Israel Palestine, conflict, or even aspects of it, I know that the Palestinians were particularly, frustrated with the inability of the administration to maintain the settlement freeze back in 2010, has also impaired America's influence, and created help and contributed to the image of a waning Pax-Americana in the Middle East. That I, did mention. What I would recommend to the Israeli government, is, avoid...avoid policy steps that would impair Israel's image not just in the Middle East but in the world, and among segments of the American, public opinion. To do the upmost, to try to exhaust all diplomatic options, to try to achieve peace with the Palestinians. If that fails, to consider measures in the event of an inability of both sides to reach a negotiated permanent two state solution, to think about ways in which of altering the status-quo. Perhaps even unilaterally. Alas, unilateralism has gotten a bad name since the Israel's withdraw from Gaza in 2005. And to a large extent, legitimately, acquired bad name...there are many mistakes made back then...but, that doesn't mean that if, Palestinian leaders, and I think that they have to make some immensely painful concessions, I in no ways minimize the concessions that Palestinians have to make, Israel has to make major concessions and take risks, if that proves incapable I think that, Israel can take measures that will minimize the damage to its international, its reputation, maintain Israel's identity as a democratic and Jewish state and um also enable us to protect ourselves in case the situation in the Middle East, in the West Bank, or elsewhere, further deteriorates.\"", "title": "Dr. Asali Raises the Issue of Palestine at the Atlantic Council", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T19:35:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hZXZmZ2fas", "description": "http://www.gradyjoinery.com/ and http://www.gradyjoinery.co.uk/\nDara Calleary TD, Former Minister of State (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) and Gary O'Sullivan of NSAI (National Standards Authority of Ireland) talk about Grady Joinery, energy efficiency and future regulations.", "title": "Grady Joinery Launch their upvc windows range", "publishedDate": "2012-06-28T14:56:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hZrQQ7i_lY", "description": "Don't know who made this.

As The Shul's head Rabbi he is both the spiritual leader and educational programmer for all ages. Since receiving rabbinical ordination from the Central Lubavitch Yeshiva in Brooklyn in 1968, Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar has worked as an emissary for the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Rabbi Sholom Dovber Lipskar is recognized as an international leader bringing Torah values to people from all walks of life.\n\nhttp://www.theshul.org The Shul is one of the country's most unorthodox, Orthodox synagogues, a popular center for both Jews who are returning to their Jewish roots & experienced congregants. The Shul sits at the intersection of Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Indian Creek Village and Surfside in Florida. \n\nFounded at the direction of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, and under the guidance of Rabbi Sholom D. Lipskar, The Shul is a spiritual guidepost and service center for the community to express their spiritual needs and gain inspiration to develop the same while connecting with Almighty G-d. The Shul is referred to as a \"Community House of G-d\" -- a spiritual lighthouse from where holiness and G-dliness emanate to the entire community. A shul is a Beit Ha-Knesset, house of gathering for prayer, a Beit Ha-Midrash, house for learning, a Beit Gemilut-Chassadim, a house for acts of kindness, and a Mikdash Me'at, a minor Holy Temple. The Shul offers all religious and spiritual services including rites of passage, momentous occasions, anniversaries, expressions of happy and sad moments, the celebration of traditional milestones, holidays and ceremonial relationships. The Shul also awakens and helps to develop the spiritual inner-self of the person. Manifesting the concept that Jewishness or Judaism is not merely a religion but a way of life. The Shul is a meeting place for social, religious, educational, cultural, and family events and where people seek guidance and advice for whatever issues life presents. The Shul is available and accessible to every single Jewish man, woman and child.\n\nThe Shul is based on the ideology of Chabad Lubavitch, which has at its foundation based on the encompassing mitzvah \"to love every Jew as one loves himself\" and to permeate that love with Acts of Kindness, Mitzvahs, Torah Study and Prayer. The Shul is a place where people want to go -- not have to go; where you enjoy being -- not where you look forward to leaving. A home away from home, a gathering place where unity is paramount.\n\nThe Aleph Institute is a non-profit national humanitarian organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for both prisoners and military personnel and their families. Rabbi Sholom Lipskar has created alternative punishment philosophies and developed unique educational opportunities for the general public in the field of treatment of closed populations.\n\nhttp://www.theshul.org\nhttp://www.justlearnit.org \nhttp://www.millionmitzvahs.org \nhttp://www.jewishadulteducation.com\nhttp://www.aleph-institute.org \nhttp://www.enduringtraditions.org\nhttp://www.cys-college.org \nhttp://www.theshulaudio.org\nhttp://www.theshulvideo.org \n\nKeywords: Jew, Jewish, Judaism, \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05e2\u05e8, Shalom Dov Ber, Chasidic, Chasid, hasid, Hasidic, Hasidism, Hassidism, Chassidus, Chassidut , Chasidut, \u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9, \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea , Chassidus, \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9, \u05d7\u05d1\"\u05d3 , shluchim, shliach, Shlichus, emissary, emissaries, Tanya, kabbalah, kabala , Kabbalistic, \u05e7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4, Torah, Talmud, \u05d7\u05d1\"\u05d3, \u05d9\u05b7\u05d4\u05b2\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea , Tanakh, kiruv, outreach, baal tshuvah, Nissan, Nisan, \u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05b8\u05df Miracles, The Shul, Bal Harbour, Sholom Lipskar, Rabbi Lipskar, synagogue, \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea, beit knesset, house of assembly, \u05e9\u05d5\u05dc, \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 beit tefila, house of prayer, \u05d0\u05e1\u05e0\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4, Holy Temple, Messiah, \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7; mashiah, mashiach, moshiach, Israel, \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u200e, Yisra'el, State of Israel, \u05de\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05b7\u05ea \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, Jerusalem, \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd\u200e, Yerushal\u00e1yim, Inspiration, Divine providence, \u05d4\u05e9\u05d2\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05ea, Hasgochoh Protis, Hasgachah Pratit, Hebrew, \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9, Yehudi, \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, Yehudim, Ladino, \u05d2\u05f3\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5, Djudio, \u05d2\u05f3\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05e1, Djudios, Yiddish, \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3, Yid, \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05df, Yidn, Israelite, Torah ,\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4, Mount Sinai, \u05d4\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9", "title": "Chanukah 5770 - Rabbi Sholom Lipskar's Message", "publishedDate": "2009-12-10T22:13:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hcFr6aVrh0", "description": "This Is A Lamprey We Found In The Chilliwack River At Chilliwack BC", "title": "Lamprey I Found In The River", "publishedDate": "2009-08-12T21:35:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hcV6CQoXQY", "description": "About the Game\n\nCombining action and strategy in a unique way, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves transports you into an epic folktale co-written with best-selling Canadian author Bryan Perro (Amos Daragon, Wariwulf), in which two feuding brothers will have to put aside their differences to save their sister, who is pursued by the Devil himself!\n\nThis time however, sheer brute strength won't be enough to save the day as your enemies are way stronger than you are.

My thoughts turn to the representatives of the Federal Government and the governments of the L\u00e4nder who are present at this departure ceremony. I offer heartfelt thanks to Archbishop Zollitsch of Freiburg, who accompanied me throughout the journey. I likewise express my gratitude to Archbishop Woelki of Berlin and Bishop Wanke of Erfurt, who also showed me hospitality, and to the entire German episcopate. Finally I offer a particular word of thanks to all those who worked behind the scenes before and during these four days in order to ensure that all went smoothly: to the civic institutions, to all those engaged in providing security, health services and public transport, and to the many volunteers. I thank all of you for these splendid days, for our many personal encounters and for your many signs of attention and affection.\n\nIn Berlin, the Federal Capital, I had the particular opportunity of addressing the members of the Bundestag and presenting some reflections on the intellectual foundations of the state. I also readily think of the fruitful conversations which I had with the Federal President and the Federal Chancellor about the present state of the German people and the international community. I was particularly touched by the cordial welcome and enthusiasm shown by so many people in Berlin.\n\nHere in the land of the Reformation, Christian unity was naturally a high point of my journey. I would mention in particular my meeting with representatives of the Lutheran Church in Germany, which took place in the former Augustinian convent of Erfurt. I am profoundly grateful for our fraternal exchange and common prayer. Significant too were my meetings with Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christians, as well with Jews and Muslims.\n\nOf course my visit was particularly aimed at the Catholic communities in Berlin, Erfurt, Eichsfeld and Freiburg. I gladly recall our common liturgical celebrations and the joy which accompanied them, our common listening to the word of God and our union in prayer -- especially in those parts of the country where efforts were made for decades to remove religion from people's lives. This gives me confidence for the future of Christianity in Germany. As in previous visits, it was clear how many people here are bearing witness to their faith and making its transforming power present in today's world. Last but not least, after the impressive celebration of World Youth Day in Madrid, I was also delighted to be in the presence of large numbers of young people in Freiburg at yesterday's youth vigil.\n\nI encourage the Church in Germany to pursue with resolute confidence the path of faith which leads people back to their roots, to the heart of the Good News of Christ. It will be small communities of believers -- and these already exist -- whose enthusiasm spreads within a pluralistic society and makes others curious to seek the light which gives life in abundance. \"There is nothing more beautiful than to know Christ and to speak to others of our friendship with him\" (Homily for the Solemn Inauguration of the Petrine Ministry, 24 April 2005).

This sexually transmitted disease is getting harder and harder to treat. The World Health Organization says gonorrhea is increasingly resistant to antibiotics. The WHO warns that there are few treatment options available, and that the world is running out of ways to cure it. Manjula Lusti-Narasimhan is a scientist at the WHO. She explains what could happen if this bacterial disease becomes untreatable: For men and women of reproductive age, they could become infertile. For women who are pregnant, they could have ectopic pregnancies or spontaneous abortions that could increase maternal deaths. And for infants born to these women with untreated gonorrhea, over half of them develop severe eye infections which can lead to blindness.  Gonorrhea is one of four major sexually transmitted infections that can be cured. The other three are chlamydial infection, syphilis and chancroid. But the organism that causes gonococcal infections has developed resistance to almost every class of antibiotic that exists. Resistance is caused by the overuse of antibiotics and the use of poor quality antibiotics. It also results from natural genetic changes, or mutations, within disease organisms. The WHO says it does not know the extent of the resistance worldwide. This is because of a lack of good information in many countries and a lack of research. But it says cases of resistance to treatment are already being reported in several countries. These include Australia, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Britain.The WHO is calling for smarter use of antibiotics and more research into new ways to treat the infections. Dr. Lusti-Marasimhan says there is no current research into new drug treatments for gonorrhea.  She says, \"We have no plan B right now.\" She says curing the disease is no longer as simple as taking a pill. As she puts it, \"We are in a state right now where in so many places this organism is rapidly developing resistance. So we do need to start looking into the research.\"The WHO is calling for urgent action to prevent the spread of untreatable gonorrhea. A new global action plan calls for increased monitoring and reporting of resistant strains of the disease. The plan also calls for better efforts to prevent, diagnose and control the infections.

Although I would recommend everyone to superheat and mine gold deposits for all their smithing xp, as this is the most efficient option, I personally enjoy doing this task. It's a much better option for those unwilling to superheat gold while mining and rather train smithing separately\n\nThe artisan's workshop is in south-east Falador. The xp reward from the task clocks in at about 21k. I don't think you can be assigned higher level swords. I'm personally level 90 at the time of this vid and am only ever assigned mithril\n\nMithril bars require 30 mithril ores and 120 coal ores each. Deposit them (noted) into the furnace and withdraw the ingots using tongs from the workbench. Then place into the furnace next to the anvils. Get work plans from Abel and click the anvil\n\nThe task itself is straightforward. It's more of a judgement call (which I sucked at on this sword) with what hits to make. I go along this sort of rule of thumb:\n-Hits needing 4/5, go for a hard hit\n-Hits needing 2/3, go for a medium hit\n-Hits needing 1, go for a soft\n-If you have spare points, use soft when there's risk to go over how much you need i.e. when needing 2 = 1 or 2 hits of soft instead of a medium hit\n-Spare careful hits until the end to give no need to calculate if it's worth it early on (it has a cooldown of 2 instead of 1 like the others)\n-If there's a chance you can break the sword (by hitting above 6 or 8 on middle and pointy end of sword respectively) use the respective safe option e.g. needing 6 in the middle but you're on 4, don't risk a medium hit and do soft instead\n\nAs your level progresses, you become more accurate with precision on hits. I would never risk a hit which would break the sword though unless 99 smithing\n\nGo to the wiki to read a more coherent guide:\nhttp://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ceremonial_sword\n\nIt can take 1-2 minutes to smith a sword when you get good. This can come to about half an hour or under for the task of 16 calculating to little under or about 300k xp/h\n\nSong:\nSia - Breathe Me (Widdler remix)\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Widdler/114563028571415?sk=wall", "title": "Smithing Mithril Ceremonial Swords: Daily Tasks", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T00:29:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hloQyiE4DI", "description": "\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304b\u3089\u306e\u3067\u753b\u8cea\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u3067\u3059", "title": "Proboscidea", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T04:20:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hlr4AIWiis", "description": "Less than a month after American Dad's air date as a TBS original series, TBS has ordered a new season of the Seth MacFarlane animated hit.\n\nRead more here:\nhttp://www.ign.com/videos/2014/11/19/tbs-has-already-renewed-american-dad-ign-news\n\nSubscribe to the IGN News Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ignnews?sub_confirmation=1", "title": "TBS Renews American Dad - IGN News - With Guest Host Sting!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T02:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hmPUEdnvNo", "description": "The Rolling Stones \nTurd On The Run\nExile on Main Street.\nWritten by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards", "title": "The Rolling Stones -Turd On The Run with Lyrics", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T18:30:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6hmlfKGKIuI", "description": "Heilpflanzen / Winterzwiebel\n\nWinterzwiebel\n\nPflanzennamen im Volksmund\nSilberzwiebel, Fr\u00fchlingszwiebel, Fr\u00fchzwiebel, Lauchzwiebel, Jungzwiebel, Zwiebelr\u00f6hrl, Zwiebelr\u00f6hrchen, R\u00f6hrenlauch, Schluppenzwiebel, Schlottenzwiebel, Schnittzwiebel, Ewige Zwiebel, Winterheckenzwiebel, Winterhecke, Wei\u00dfe Florentiner, Grober Schnittlauch, Jakobslauch, Johannislauch, Fleischlauch, Hohllauch,Schnattra\n\nWissenschaftlicher Name\nAllium fistulosum L.\n\nPflanzenfamilie\nAmaryllisgew\u00e4chse (Amaryllidaceae)\n\nHeilkr\u00e4uter / Anwendung\nAbsze\u00df, Albuminurie, Alkoholmissbrauch, Atemnot, Asthenie, Atemprobleme, Bandwurm, Bluterguss, Bronchitis, Darmparasiten, Diabetes, Frostbeule, Hautgeschw\u00fcr, Heiserkeit, H\u00fchneraugen, Husten, Insektenstich, Lunge, Karbunkel, Nagelentz\u00fcndung, \u00d6dem, Ohrensausen, Quetschung, Reizhusten, Rheumatismus, Schrunde, Sommersprossen, Verbrennung, Verstopfung, Warze, W\u00fcrmer.\nSteckbrief / Beschreibung\n\nDie Winterzwiebel ist eine nahe Verwandte der K\u00fcchenzwiebel (A. cepa L.).

It was certainly \"cozy\" in the living room, but that may have been a result of cramming in seven people (five band members and two cameras), drums, amps, guitars, furniture, oh and not to mention the wide array of other instruments and recording gear not being used that day (hmm, some of this stuff in the background looks familiar).\n\nThe first thing that is immediately apparent about this group, aside from the fact that they are all super talented musicians, is that they're all having fun with the music.  So much fun in fact, it almost makes you feel like everyone else around here is being too damn serious all the time.   Not to take the emphasis away from their music, which is immediately accessible, smartly crafted and beautifully textured indie pop (oh, and did I mention they nail those three-part harmonies, because, well, they can all sing like nobody's business?).  But I think it's pretty rare to see such genuine collective energy, and it's that intangible element that makes the music so exciting and endearing. \n\nThey quickly ran through three songs as the sun went down, including a cover that's been sneaking into their live shows of En Vogue's mid-nineties hit \"Don't Let Go\" -- just in time for the rumored En Vogue reunion album 2011 (side note: this song is now on my karaoke list).  Amy and Jon Bates had to run off, but the rest of us went up the street to El Chavito for a drink (and a lot of chips and salsa).

All of them thought they could sell Asturias to their clients and praised the quality of accommodation and especially the food.\n\nThe above video is a montage of their journey as we brought them along the coastal route of St. James and also a few interviews we recorded with the visitors on their final night in Asturias. As you can hear from them, they enjoyed the trip very much but also felt that more promotion was needed to give Asturias the international recognition she deserves.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who gave up their time and energy to produce a rewarding experience for the visitors (you will find them mentioned at the end of the video).

But, could they all be wrong?\n\nNina Teicholz is a journalist, who worked for a time as a food critic. Despite a diet rich in saturated fats, the writer lost 10 pounds during her assignment. Her cholesterol levels also remained at a steady, healthy concentration. This led her to being an investigation into saturated fats and the role they play in human health. Now, she has released a book about her findings. \n\nThe description of the work reads, \"What if the very foods we've been denying ourselves -- the creamy cheeses, the sizzling steaks -- are themselves the key to reversing the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease?\"  \n\nAn analysis published by a team of international scientists in March also questions conventional wisdom on the subject. The reported stated researchers were unable to find any link between high levels of saturated fats and heart disease. The use of various oils for cooking also did not appear to have any link to heart disease. \n\nAnother study, this one published in the medical journal BMJ, draws attention to different types of cholesterol. Most people know about LDL and HDL forms of the lipoproteins. Generally, it is the LDL form which is considered to be \"bad\" cholesterol. However, this report noted Type A LDL's are the ones present in saturated fats, while Type B's, found in carbohydrates, are the variety that cause heart disease. \n\nTeicholz stated the cause of widespread obesity in the United States is due to the large quantities of carbohydrates and breads consumed by Americans. \n\nIf the author is correct about her conclusions, you may not need to feel guilty about cooking steaks on the grill this summer. \n\n\n\n\nSupport Indymedia!\nDonate USD: http://nnn.is/donate-dollars\nDonate BTC: http://nnn.is/donate-bitcoin\n\nDownload your free Next News \"Heroes & Villains\" Poster here: http://nextnewsnetwork.com/the-2013-heroes-villains-posters\n\nLIVE: http://NextNewsNetwork.com \nFacebook: http://Facebook.com/NextNewsNet\nTwitter: http://Twitter.com/NextNewsNet\nSub: http://NNN.is/the_new_media\nMeet the Next News Team: http://youtu.be/2QnNKwQ2WkY\nHashtag: #N3\n\n\nAbout:\nNext News Network's WHDT World News program airs daily at 6pm and 11pm Eastern on Comcast, DirecTV and Over-the-Air and Online at http://NNN.is/on-WHDT\n\nWHDT World News is available to 6 million viewers from South Beach to Sebastian, Florida and to 2 million viewers in Boston, Massachusetts via WHDN.\n\nWHDT broadcasts on RF channel 44 (virtual channel 9) from Palm City and is carried on cable TV channels 44 (SD) and 1044 (HD) by AT&T, on cable channels 17 (SD) and 438 (HD) in West Palm Beach by Comcast, on satellite channel 44 (SD) in West Palm Beach by DIRECTV, and on WHDN-Boston which broadcasts on RF channel 38 (virtual channel 6) from the Government Center district in downtown Boston.\n\nMore about WHDT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHDT", "title": "Are Doctors Wrong About Saturated Fats?", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T20:14:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6iQEfjaK49Y", "description": "dandelion, mniszek:\nbardzo zdrowe zielsko dla papug", "title": "Mniszek lekarski/ Taraxacum officinale-dandelion", "publishedDate": "2008-05-14T03:07:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6iR2kPqf_ZI", "description": "Internal hernia; Paraduodenal hernia, Laparoscopic Repair, Laparoscopic Surgery for Left Paraduodenal Hernia in chennai Dr.T.K.Neelamekam , Dr.Premkumar Balachandran \nThank\u2029youContact\u2029Details: http://www.chennaimedinfo.in/gastroenterology.php", "title": "Laparoscopic Repair  Paraduodenal hernia repair.avi", "publishedDate": "2012-01-03T09:59:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6iRIoNw4m9w", "description": "\"Last Supper for Malthus\", directed by Klaus Pas, is competing in ECU 2010's European Documentary Feature category.

His new album \"Us\" (released September 21st on Rhymesayers Entertainment) is a progression that will make Brother Ali one of the most enduring figures in hip-hop; while still aware, Ali has turned his gaze inward, and started examining the human condition from the outside in. A profound personal glimpse into a vulnerability seldom seen or heard in music, \"Us\" touches on the strengths and flaws of the human condition, exploring drug abuse, divorce, homophobia and many more topics that most people are scared to touch in their own lives, much less on an album for the world to see.\n\nAs with previous endeavors, the beats here are courtesy of Ant, whose production work seems to be getting more soulful and lush by the minute. The guest appearances only accentuate Brother Alis strengths, with Chuck D, Freeway, Joell Ortiz and Stokley Williams of Mint Condition making strong appearances.\n\nBetter known as Brother Alis DJ, BK-One takes his years of experience as a DJ and puts on his producer hat joining forces with up and coming Twin Cities beatsmith Benzilla to craft a Brazilian musical bed for some of Hip Hops most engaging MCs.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.

The creation of this unique model is the synthesis resulting from the combined perspectives of the two brands.\nEugenio Franzetti, Public Relations Manager of Peugeot Italia, says: \"Peugeot and Castagna have so many values in common that it was inevitable their paths would cross, sooner or later. First of all, tradition: Castagna was established in 1849, Peugeot has over 200 years of history... it is no surprise that we met at a vintage car\nAs a matter of fact, both Brands have a veritable cult of tradition. Peugeot preserves its heritage at the Sochaux Museum (France) and can boast an organization - \"L'Aventure Peugeot\" -- which unites all the Lion's Classic Car Clubs existing globally, including Peugeot Italy's Club Storico.\n\"The past is a continuous source of inspiration for the future;\" adds Eugenio Franzetti \"If we look at the history of our models, it clearly emerges that Peugeot has always pursued innovation and development within its model range, either by manufacturing unique models or by drawing upon independent body stylists, for its sports models like the Dar'l Mats or for series production cars, where the collaboration with the car designer Pininfarina is exemplary. Therefore, it was perhaps an obvious decision to sublimate the intrinsic values of the Peugeot models -- quality finish, attention to detail, real driving enjoyment -- in the production of a unique model that could incorporate the typical values of the Castagna products: development of new materials and their unprecedented mix and match; the warmth, the refinement and the originality of its creations, the scrupulous quality craftsmanship.\"\nCastagna chose the 508 RXH model, the flagship of the range for Peugeot given its generous equipment and it was its \"Allroad\" design that provoked and inspired the coachbuilder from Milan to express his creativity and enhance the premium quality features of this model.\nCurrently, 508 RXH is the highest technological expression of the Peugeot brand. Its innovative HYbrid4 technology allows to mate a 2.0 litre, 163 bhp front diesel engine with a 37 bhp rear electric motor, capable of delivering a maximum power of 200 bhp that can be best exploited, depending upon the circumstances, by selecting one of the four modes foreseen by the drive mode selection knob positioned on the central tunnel.\nYou can select the Auto mode to privilege riding comfort and sustainable mobility, or the Sport mode to maximise performance and available power. However you can also ride in the ZEV mode relying only on the electric motor or use the 4WD to exploit the two powertrains and continuously power the front and rear wheels.\n\"Together with Castagna, we set out from the distinctive features of the 508 RXH and from its HYbrid4 technology to imagine a journey. The journey of a successful man who lives in an urban context but who is also keen to escape for short getaways in the countryside or for short mountain skiing holidays, and travels through these different landscapes in the environmentally - friendly way which a hybrid car allows\" concludes Eugenio Franzetti.\nIt is now the turn of Gioacchino Acampora, Castagna Coachbuilder's chief designer, to reveal his sources of inspiration for this car: \"It is no secret: over the last few years -- and I even wrote it \"back in the day\" - I have stated my admiration for French design and the manner in which the French make products. However, since when I had the opportunity to drive some of the Lion's cars, my actual feelings have surpassed my expectations. Recent prototypes developed by Peugeot like the Onyx concept car, are astonishing due to the use of natural and warm materials, providing a marked contrast to the \"logical\" aspect of the geometrical lines.\nThe underlying idea is simply to allow the spirit of the car to emerge through the use of a single colour. I have often experienced that magical sensation of noiseless drive that this car provides. Sometimes, one would purposely choose a given route just to get lost in the sound of silence: so strong was the desire for \"mimesis\" at a certain point. We drew inspiration from all this to develop a livery that blended the interior to the exterior of the car in a single seamless chromatic tone and this was possible thanks to Lechler and Alcantara.\nhttp://www.carwp.com.br/2014/02/castagna-peugeot-508-rxh-hybrid4-2014.html\nFind us on https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carwp/505636076134244\nDOWNLOAD IMAGES: http://CARWP.com.br\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects", "title": "2014 Castagna Peugeot 508 RXH Hybrid4 on 19\" 2.0 200 hp", "publishedDate": "2014-02-12T17:05:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ih3ctIP6RY", "description": "If you like to laugh, then you are going to love Carla Rea.", "title": "Comedienne Carla Rea on Action News Midday", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T19:26:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ihTRwuFnlY", "description": "235lbs and Still STRONG", "title": "235Lbs Crusher Musick Inclining 275lbs for 7reps", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T01:45:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ihjDdNo4x0", "description": "Get more information about Tenerife from Tenerife Forum at http://tenerifeforum.org.es \n\nLooking for a useful Tenerife destination guide including all the other islands in the Canaries, or just some Tenerife chat and news? \n\nTenerife Forum is a resource rich community and offers valuable tips and advice to both visitors and residents to these popular islands.

Radical Islamists may perceive this sympathetically since they are anti-American.\" \n\nIn a news conference on Monday, President Abdullah Gul said Turkey had advance information the organisation was preparing an attack prior to the Ankara bombing. \n\n\"Unfortunately, our security and intelligence apparatuses were on red alert that the terrorist organisation was planning an attack, and everyone worked around the clock to address this. But unfortunately efforts to prevent it did not succeed,\nDHKP-C to take revenge on Turkey for supporting the Syrian rebels.\n\nDHKP-C was viewed as a has-been terrorist group from the Cold War era. Starting out in the 1970s, it carried out attacks on Western targets in Turkey but hasn't received much attention. The suicide bomber that carried out Friday's attack was previously arrested in 1997 in connection with rocket attacks on a police station and a military officers' club. He was released from prison after a hunger strike did severe damage to his brain. The group's suicide attackers often have incurable diseases.\n\n\"Syria has provided a lot of facilities to this group, including camps, ammunition, etc. They had a really close relationship with Syrian intelligence,\" said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a Turkish terrorism expert.\n\nOzcan also said that the Assad regime restored its links to the group after Turkey began harboring Syrian rebels. DHKP-C has organized pro-Assad rallies in Turkey and has used its agents, including some posing as journalists, to spread false rumors of Syrian refugees in Turkey committing murder and other misdeeds.\n\nTurkey has arrested 85 DHKP-C members since January and charged 55 last week with planning to kill government officials and attack embassies. Some members are accused of sharing state secrets with Greece and Syria.\n\nThe DHKP-C has taken credit for the bombing and explicitly said it was in response to Turkey's policy towards Assad. It claimed that \"Syrian collaborationist looters are trained and armed on our [Turkish] land and are sent back to massacre Syrian people.\" It stated that the U.S. is its number one enemy and Turkey was assisting its \"imperialist\" plans.\n\nA DHKP-C splinter group called Acilciler, or \"Urgent Ones,\" has about 500 members and operates from Syria under the name of the \"Hatay Liberation Army.\" Its leader, Mihrac Ural, is in Latakia. In the past, he has worked closely with the Kurdish Marxist terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has also received Syrian backing.\n\nIran reportedly hired DHKP-C in 2010 to stroke public unrest in Turkey in an attempt to stop the constitutional referendum. However, there should be skepticism towards this accusation. Iran praised the passing of the constitutional amendments, which made Turkey more democratic and strengthened the ability of the ruling Islamist party to push its agenda.\n\nHenri Barkey, a former State Department official and professor, doubts that Syria contracted DHKP-C to carry out the bombing. He says the group is cultish and wouldn't do the bidding of someone else. Assad's involvement in a terrorist attack against a U.S. target could also backfire and stir up American support for the rebels and ASssad's ouster.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of character for Assad to sponsor a terrorist attack simply out of rage. After all, his thugs are known for deliberately targeting children, torturing political prisoners and all sorts of heinous crimes that would be unthinkable to any moral person. Secret documents published by Al-Arabiya indicate the regime was behind a fire at a mall in Qatar that killed 19 people, 13 of them children.\n\nIf Assad was behind this terrorist attack in Turkey, then it could mean that he's decided to launch a wave of reprisal attacks against his enemies. The attempted transfer of anti-aircraft missiles to Hezbollah, foiled by Israel's air strike last week, could be the result of such a decision.", "title": "Gezi parc taksim DHKPC, PKK, and Turkish terrorist organizations", "publishedDate": "2013-06-11T11:32:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ikYS-TC9e4", "description": "Soulager une tendinite - Apaiser un tendon: Soulager une inflammation des tendons: Pour soulager ou apaiser une tendinite des tendons, vous pouvez commencer par appliquer de l'argile et laisser reposer.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes.[10] Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes.[11]\nThe first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue.[12] Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.", "title": "Best Flower In Kolkata Flower Show", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T17:35:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6imXnEDHA6o", "description": "Visual/motion graphics video featuring soundtrack and sound FX", "title": "10 Things to Know About ERA-EDTA", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T08:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6imjUIf50gw", "description": "This year is the 10th edition of the Women\u2019s Forum Global Meeting.

It is generally found in beech woodland in summer and autumn. Two subspecies have been described from southern Europe. First officially described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Tricholoma pardinum has had a confusing taxonomic history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist Jacob Christian Sch\u00c3\u00a4ffer described the species Agaricus tigrinus with an illustration corresponding to what is thought to be T. pardinum, and consequently, the name Tricholoma tigrinum has been used erroneously in some European field guides. \n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC:BA 3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricholoma_pardinum\n\nText to Speech powered by TTS-API.COM\n\nImages are Public Domain", "title": "All About - Tricholoma pardinum", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T10:27:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ixz5E5pNn0", "description": "This is the basic step of temporal bone surgery.

The felling of a giant.\n\nThe majestic elephants are the largest mammal on land yet they are peaceful and gentle creatures. There are two types of elephant species, Asian (Indian Elephants) and African. Asian Elephants are easily distinguishable from the African tuskers by their smaller size and ears, more rounded back and fourth toenail on each of their hind feet. They have thick, dry skin with a small amount of stiff hair, and are grey to brown in colour. The current worldwide population of Asian elephants is estimated at between 41,410 and 52,345 individuals. Listed as an endangered species, its the only remaining species of the genus Elephas mainly distributed in Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east. \n\nGenerally Elephants have poor eyesight, but they possess a  very good sense of hearing and smell. The lifespan of Elephants is awesome, having bigger brains and an amazing memory. They rarely live on isolation but mostly stay together. So when one animal detects danger, the whole herd is alerted. The major regions where elephants are found in India include the forests of Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Uttara Pradesh, Orissa, and Assam. It is estimated that there are over 28,000 Indian Elephants in India, including zoos and animal parks. The Indian Elephant is found across India in protected forests and in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Famous Indian Elephant reserves in India includes Periyar Widlife Sanctuary, Bandipur and Nagarhole National Parks.\n\n\nAssam is a north-eastern state of India surrounded by six of the other Seven Sister States: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya.  Assam is known for its exquisite natural resources, geography and its important role in India's freedom struggle.  The capital city of Assam is Dispur, a specialized city circuit region located on the inside of its largest metropolis, Guwahati. Assam is particularly famous for its natural beauty. The landscape includes tea gardens, the river Brahmaputra, and many historical monuments and temples. Swami Vivekananda once said that, \"next only to Kashmir, Assam is the most beautiful place in India\". A state with an abundance of forest, Assam also has five national parks, around half a dozen other wildlife sanctuaries, and is home to two-thirds of the population of the unique one-horned rhino. When it comes to wildlife, Assam too has successfully conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the tiger and numerous species of birds, and it provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. It is becoming an increasingly popular destination for wildlife tourism, and Kaziranga and Manas are both World Heritage Sites. \n\nAnother aspect that separates Assam from the rest of Indian states is the rich composite culture of the state. Assamese constitute the majority of the state's population but the state has over two dozen other big and small tribal groups with many of them having their own language, writing system, dance forms and traditions. Assam comprises the Brahmaputra and the Barak river valleys along with the Karbi Anglong and the Dima Hasao district with an area of 30,285 square miles. Assam also shares international borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh. \n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

And so remember I understand she was uncomfortable and no one likes to be in the hospital but she was under supervision by the CDC and our health officials at all times and I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s getting to go back home and hopefully her health will remain being good and if it is, then it\u2019s good for her, her family and everybody else. But we\u2019re not going to take any risks with the public health in New Jersey.\n \nQuestion: Why did you reverse your decision initially?\n \nGovernor Christie: I didn\u2019t reverse any decision. Why are you saying I reversed a decision?\n \nQuestion: Because now she gets to go home\u2026\n \nGovernor Christie: She always\u2026\n \nQuestion: (inaudible)\n \nGovernor Christie: If she was continuing to be ill she would have to stay. She hadn\u2019t had any symptoms for 24 hours and she tested negative for Ebola so there\u2019s no reason to keep her. The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. So if you live in New Jersey, we\u2019ll quarantine you in your home, that\u2019s always been the policy. If you live outside the state and you\u2019re symptomatic, we\u2019re not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released. And that\u2019s a common sense approach that the federal government wasn\u2019t taking, that we took first in New Jersey and New York, has now been adopted by Chicago, has now been adopted by Maryland. As I said yesterday on the news, this will become the national policy because it\u2019s smart, tough, common sense policy.\n \nQuestion: Governor when you first described her as obviously ill, she took great offense at that\u2026\n \nGovernor Christie: She took great offense at everything I said, Michael.\n \nQuestion: Do you stand by that? Do you intend maybe speak to her? Talk to her?\n \nGovernor Christie: No I don\u2019t. Listen I have no reason to talk to her. My job is not to represent her, it\u2019s to represent the people of New Jersey. So she was ill. She was obviously ill enough that the CDC and medical officials hospitalized her and gave her an Ebola test, Michael. They don\u2019t do that just for fun. That\u2019s a very specific, difficult, expensive test to do. And so the fact is that I know she was upset and angry, she wanted to go home. Any of us have seen people who are traveling and they\u2019ve been stopped, whether they\u2019re late for a plane or whatever they\u2019re doing, they get upset and angry. That\u2019s fine. I have absolutely nothing but good will for her going forward. She\u2019s a good person and went over and was doing good work over in West Africa. But she needs to understand that the obligation of elected officials is to protect the public health of all the people and if that inconvenienced her for a period of time, that\u2019s what we need to do to protect the public, that\u2019s what we will continue to do. So there\u2019s been no reversal or change in any way of our policy or our approach. People are symptomatic, they go in a hospital. If they live in New Jersey, they get quarantined at home. And if they don\u2019t and they\u2019re not symptomatic, then we set up quarantine for them out of state. But if they\u2019re symptomatic, they\u2019re going in the hospital.\n \nQuestion: What\u2019s your response to Andrew Cuomo then easing\u2026\n \nGovernor Christie: Governor Cuomo did not ease any restrictions at all. The same policies that we put into effect on Friday are still the same policies now. That\u2019s been reported incorrectly. I spoke to Governor Cuomo last night. He\u2019s in the exact same position that he\u2019s been all along. So I have no response to him because there\u2019s nothing to respond to. And remember Illinois has since adopted this policy, so has now the state of Maryland. So I\u2019m telling you guys this is going to become a national policy eventually. Eventually the CDC will come around. And remember they were late to the game in Texas and we had people infected because of it.", "title": "Governor Christie: I Did Not Reverse Any Decision", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T17:41:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6iz-pqq62IE", "description": "Xysma was formed in Naantali,Finland in 1988.

Then 2 EPs \"Above the Mind of Morbidity\" and \"Fata Morgana\" both released in 1990. The first album \"Yeah\" was released in 1991 and was the first \"Death 'n' Roll\" release ever.

Culhane's \"Melodic-Mnemonic\" method worked so well that his \"at-risk\" students were able to successfully compete with \"gifted students\" and test scores went up on biology exams.

Its exterior design conveys both refinement and strength, which complements a totally redesigned interior that will raise the bar in its segment. \n\nWith three-row seating for up to eight, an array of standard features, a host of available in-cabin technologies, and increased cargo capacity, the new Highlander offers a nuanced balance of style, comfort and utility. \n\nToyota engineers raised the bar on interior design for the mid-size SUV segment by adding even more refinement and functionality to the new Highlander and Highlander Hybrid. The 2015 Highlander model offers a premium interior highlighted by increased spaciousness for up to eight people, and an array of standard comfort, convenience and technology features.\n\nThe second row offers bench-seating for three passengers or two captain\u2019s seats featuring a collapsible side tray with cup holders for added convenience. Getting into the third-row is made easier with the addition of a one-step second-row sliding seat function on both driver and passenger sides that provides nearly three more inches of space for easier entry and exit to the third-row. An overall interior width increase of 3.7 inches in the third-row and a standard recline function creates added comfort for up to three passengers. Like the second-row bench, the third-row is 60/40 split for added passenger and storage flexibility and convenience. Rear cargo space behind the third-row has also increased by 34 percent for added storage.\n\nHighlander will be available in four well-equipped grades: LE, LE Plus, XLE, and Limited.\n\nThe all-new 2015 Highlander delivers the total package of bold exterior styling, refined interior design, excellent performance, and great overall value. The 2015 Toyota Highlander is available at Marietta Toyota, conveniently located at: 750 Cobb Parkway S, Marietta GA 30060, just 4 miles north of Galleria / Cumberland Mall or 1/2 mile north of Dobbins Air Force Base.

A small shark usually not exceeding 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in length, this species is easily recognizable by its slender body and short but broad head, as well as tubular skin flaps beside the nostrils, oval eyes with vertical pupils, and white-tipped dorsal and caudal fins. One of the most common sharks found on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, the whitetip reef shark occurs as far west as South Africa and as far east as Central America. It is typically found on or near the bottom in clear water, at a depth of 8--40 m (26--131 ft).", "title": "Poorly filmed whitetip reef shark montage! | Sipadan Island", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T16:00:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jAcOO40qJ0", "description": "Download here: http://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=24371&a=1488904&epi=signumsandyt&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewAlbum%3Fi%3D332067213%26id%3D332066402%26s%3D143452%26uo%3D6%26partnerId%3D2003\n\nThe re-launch of the Signum duo has brought nothing but good. A revival of the legendary producer-duo Pascal Minnaard and Ron Hagen, the guys behind 'What You Got 4 Me', 'Push Through' and the latter 'Distant Signature', was more than welcome to their loyal group of fans.\nThis time, it's the summer's hot sun that have inspired them. Sunny guitar and a deep and relaxing progressive sound set forth a true holiday spirit, found in 'Riddles In The Sand'. It's the soundtrack to anyone's Balearic dream: catchy, groovy and luminous. The track, which the Signum guys release under their Ron Hagen & Pascal M alias, already gave prominence to Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance 2009 album. \n The Omnia remix of 'Riddles In The Sand' is a completely different approach to its guitar-melody. Less trancy, but loaded with a top notch proghouse sound that won't slip by unnoticed. The Ukrainian producer did a splendid job in giving the track a richer sound, and giving it a dramatic touch. Atmospheric all the way!  \n\nMusic video produced by Dancefoundation.com\n\nFor more information visit:\nhttp://www.armadamusic.com", "title": "Signum (Ron Hagen & Pascal M) - Riddles In The Sand (Official Music Video) [High Quality]", "publishedDate": "2009-10-05T09:42:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jAl0d6uQJY", "description": "Annihilation of ferret plaything.", "title": "Thaumaturgy", "publishedDate": "2006-04-30T14:47:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jBE7WGH3lU", "description": "Centrifugation Separation Technology", "title": "AX-215 Centrifuge Animation.flv", "publishedDate": "2010-11-22T04:21:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jBZKfUOkLw", "description": "can polat emenerresul\u00fc okuyor", "title": "can polat ba\u015f m\u00fcezzin", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T18:23:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jBlC02H9Q4", "description": "VVIL - Kvass/Ulvungen: 3 - 3 ( M\u00e5l Kvass/Ulvungen )\nScoringer:\n3-1 (44) Per Magne Jonsson\n\n3-2 (57) Espen Mellems\u00e6ter\n\n3-3 (82) Kenneth Sira", "title": "VVIL - Kvass/Ulvungen: 3 - 3 ( M\u00e5l :Kvass/Ulvungen )", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T18:59:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jC2v7vn1ic", "description": "honkie tonkie pianissie - Lorenzo Verspui live gezongen \n\n17 mei voor radio het hollandsdiep \nin het cafe de fijnproever in tilburg", "title": "honkie tonkie pianissie - Lorenzo Verspui live gezongen", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T10:56:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jCExu49IrU", "description": "\" 35-ans-et-plus \" vous d\u00e9voile un gommage pour visage qui ne vous co\u00fbte que 0 centime d'euros.

Dolphin Quest trainers were in the water during the dolphin birth to observe and comfort the new dolphin mom. Dolphins Pele (the new baby's grandmother) and Noelani (the baby's aunt) were also in the Dolphin Quest lagoon to keep Keo company.\n\nThe baby, a female calf, and mom are both well and wonderful. The baby dolphin began nursing within four hours of birth. About 50 people gathered around the Hilton's Dolphin Quest lagoon to witness the rarely-seen event. Keo was in labor for approximately one hour.\n\nThe first 30 days of a newborn dolphin's life are the most critical. Dolphin Quest trainers will continue round-the-clock watch over the pair, recording nursing and respiration rates, and making sure that Keo is well-fed and hydrated. Over that period, Keo's new baby will be introduced to the other nine dolphins at Dolphin Quest Hawaii. After the initial 30 day care period, trainers will select a name for the new baby girl. \n\nVisitors can see the new baby swimming with mom at Dolphin Quest Hawaii at Hilton Waikoloa Village. \n\nKeo's calf is the 18th dolphin baby and the first second-generation calf to be born at the conservation and education-dedicated marine park since Dolphin Quest opened in 1988.\n\n      ###", "title": "Incredible Dolphin Birth at Dolphin Quest Hawaii", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19T02:33:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jCY1lWujK0", "description": "One of my watersnakes i caught out of a pool in my neighborhood.He eats f/t fish and an ocassional live tadpole.Tame as can be.", "title": "baby banded watersnake ( nerodia fasciatata pictiventris)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T00:55:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jC_xzxfdxY", "description": "Living Hope Haiti and Baptist Health's Surgical trip to Haiti in August 2010.

I asked if he would follow the kind of gun confiscation orders which Guardsmen received after Hurricane Katrina.  I wasn't impressed with his demeanor or his answer, \n\nwhich was basically \"we'll refer to legal eagles.\"   So for about six years I've been itching to ask a high ranking soldier the same kind of question *on-camera.*  Without going out of my way, of course :)  \n\nI get my chance on Feb 12, 2103.  Two soldiers appear in uniform at an NH state house hearing.  I hear one of them referred to as \"General.\"  So I take up position outside the hearing room, await his exit  and have a much more positive experience.  \n\nIt occurred to me after filming this that the general's likable answer could get him in trouble later.  And that, for this reason, interviews of this type could conceivably be counterproductive.   On the other hand, anyone serving that high up \n\nin the armed forces has surely already taken action to assist cruel and unconstitutional endeavors such as the Iraqupation.  Holding a continued powerful position is no one's right, no matter how much we might appreciate something they've said.  \n\nHowever I will raise concerns using my bully pulpit, if I ever learn of any retaliation against this pleasant warrior over his comments. \n\nSome or all of the video/audio in this clip's likely available for you to use, commercially or however you like...

Due to their importance, beta receptors are natural targets for drug development. beta-1 blockers, atenolol, are used treatment of cardiac arrythmias and congestive heart disease. Beta-2, as it is important in lungs, is a target for asthma treatment. Salbutamol being one of the most common ones.\n\nNebivolol is a fairly new beta blocker. It  binds selectively to beta-1 receptors and it is used in treatment of hypertension. Nebivolol is the most selective beta-1 blocker. The origin of selectivity is, however, poorly understood. Our aim here is to investigate the molecular origin of this selectivity. This was done by combining large scale molecular dynamics and molecular docking studies using the beta-2 receptor with nebivolol. Our study shows that water has a very important role determining binding affinity. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the importance of water in beta-blocker binding. We used two optical isomers of nebivolol, the so-called ssss- and srrr-forms and the interactions with water turned out to be the decisive factor in the better binding of the srrr-form.\n\nThe movies shows a nebivolol molecule (red) in the binding pocket of a beta-2 receptor. The receptor is embedded in a lipid membrane (shown in green) and we have zoomed into the region of the nebivolol-receptor interaction.

The city was a bishop's residence in the 5th century, and its episcopal power was affirmed during the 12th century. With the decline of the episcopate, Volterra became a place of interest of the Florentines, whose forces conquered Volterra. Florentine rule was not always popular, and opposition occasionally broke into rebellion. These rebellions were put down by Florence.\nThe poet Jacopo da Leona was a judge at Volterra in the 13th century.\nWhen the Florentine Republic fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family and later followed the history of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\n\nRecommended:\n\nhttp://reiseworldtv.de\nhttp://blog.reiseworldtv.de\nhttp://facebook.de/reiseworld\n\nhttp://einfachkochen.com\nhttp://blog.einfachkochen.com\nhttp://facebook.de/einfachkochen\n\nhttp://youtube.de/animalfilm\n\nhttp://youtube.de/autogefuehl\nhttp://autogefuehl.de\nhttp://facebook.de/autogefuehl\n\nhttp://fraukahl.de", "title": "Volterra, Tuscay Italy", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T11:26:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jT7xs8D85A", "description": "Duologue - Music from the 20th Century\nConcert promo\nMay 17, 2012, Athenaeum concert hall, Athens\nAmalia Kountouri (flute), Myrto Akrivou (piano)\n\nDuologue\n\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 20\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 \n\n\u0391\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7: \u03c6\u03bb\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf  \n\u039c\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03ce \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5: \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\n\n\u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7 17 \u039c\u03b1\u0390\u03bf\u03c5 2012, 20:30\n\n\u0394\u0399\u0395\u0398\u039d\u0395\u03a3 \u039a\u0391\u039b\u039b\u0399\u03a4\u0395\u03a7\u039d\u0399\u039a\u039f \u039a\u0395\u039d\u03a4\u03a1\u039f & \u03a9\u0394\u0395\u0399\u039f ATHENAEUM\n\u0391\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd 3, \u0398\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u0397\u03a3\u0391\u03a0)\n\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb. 210 3211987\n\u0395\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2: 10\u20ac, \u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc: 5\u20ac\n\u0394\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03ac\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Athenaeum\n\n\n\u039f\u03b9 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf 2008 \u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae.\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 20\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1. \u03a4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc, \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03b4\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03bb\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd. \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c3\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03cc\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf.\n\nhttp://flutepiano.blogspot.com/", "title": "Duologue - Kountouri-Akrivou - Music from the 20th Century.mp4", "publishedDate": "2012-05-07T10:48:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jTOysImQSo", "description": "Monk performing his tune \"Coming On The Hudson\".

For the Chinese perch Siniperca chuatsi, see mandarin fish.\n\nThe mandarinfish or mandarin dragonet (Synchiropus splendidus), is a small, brightly colored member of the dragonet family, which is popular in the saltwater aquarium trade. The mandarinfish is native to the Pacific, ranging approximately from the Ryukyu Islands south to Australia.\n\nTaxonomy and etymology\nThe mandarinfish was first described as Callionymus splendidus in 1927 by Albert William Herre, an American ichthyologist working in the Philippines. It was later placed in genus Synchiropus. The generic name Synchiropus is from Ancient Greek syn-, meaning \"together\", and -chiropus meaning \"hand-foot\". The specific epithet splendidus is from Latin for splendid. The common name of the mandarinfish comes from its extremely vivid colouration, evoking the robes of an Imperial Chinese mandarin. Other common names include mandarin goby, green mandarin, striped mandarinfish, striped dragonet, green dragonet and sometimes psychedelic mandarinfish. The similarly named mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi), properly known as the Chinese perch, is only distantly related.\nThe mandarinfish belongs to the perciform family Callionymidae, the dragonets, which counts 10 genera and more than 182 species. Genus Synchiropus counts 51 species, divided into 10 subgenera. The mandarinfish is in subgenus Synchiropus (Pterosynchiropus) along with the Australian LSD-fish (S. occidentalis) and the LSD- or psychedelic fish (S. picturatus).", "title": "The Most Colorful Fish In The World / Mandarinfish / Synchiropus Splendidus", "publishedDate": "2014-05-07T11:51:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jZucq5CYc8", "description": "Claim your \"Debt Free ASAP!\" Workbook at http://DebtGoToGuy.com, plus free Videos & Debt Analysis! -  What's the difference between \"credit rating\" (credit score) and \"credit worthiness?\"  How do these two different aspects of your credit affect you?

He was born six weeks after Grieg, and outlived him by two years - but unlike his contemporary he is forgotten, at least outside Norway. In his lifetime he was apparently a household name there, and wrote a lot of dance and special-occasion music, as well as an operetta. His piano music is often reminiscent of Grieg, but totally overshadowed by him, alas. The title of this piece, published in 1897, refers to the call of the Huldra, a forest creature from Scandinavian folklore.  She often appears as a beautiful girl (sometimes a dairymaid) and may lure men into the forest to 'have her way' with them!  You can read more about the tradition here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldra .

One of the more popular\nprophecies concerning the 'end of time' scenario is that of St. Malachi,\nwho allegedly prophesied a list of 111 popes to follow the man who was\npope at the time of his prophecy, Pope Innocent II. He didn't come out and\nname anybody, of course; he just gave a little phrase describing each\npontificate. Like the quatrains of Nostradamus, these little phrases can\nmean almost anything to anyone, and therefore can likewise be applied to\nanyone.\n\nDespite the obvious fraudulence of the Prophecy of St. Malachi, there are\nplenty of true believers; and of those true believers, some stand out as\nmore devoted than the rest.\n\nWHICH SIMPLY MEANS THAT I AM ONLY SPECULATING TO KNOW WHO IS THE\nNEXT POPE.  This is not God's word, only my firm belief based on my researches. \nTime will tell but it is really interesting that a portal opened on Peter's basilica so\nthis might indicate that the next pope's first name really is Peter.\n\nMore at:\nhttp://www.the-truth-ministries.us/Is_This_Final_Pope_The_Second_Beast/", "title": "Lightning strikes St. Peter's Basilica = PORTAL OPENED - Indicating Pietro Parolin?", "publishedDate": "2012-03-03T19:27:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jlkYFfUhGU", "description": "Take a tour around our Aspen Suites Bangkok - a boutique serviced apartment located in downtown Bangkok and near major city attractions and transportation yet situated in the tranquil soi of Sukhumvit Soi 2\n\nCompass Hospitality Facebook: www.compasshospitality.com/compasshospitality\nAspen Suites Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AspenSuites?fref=ts\n\nCompass Hospitality Google+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107762478716393377801/+Compasshospitalityhotels/posts\nAspen Suites Google+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107762478716393377801/+AspenSuitesBangkok/posts\n\nCompass Hospitality Twitter: www.twitter.com/compassh\n\nCompass Hospitality Blog: www.compasshospitality.wordpress.com\n\nCompass Hospitality Instagram: www.instagram.com/compasshospitality", "title": "Aspen Suites Bangkok", "publishedDate": "2014-06-27T10:39:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jmLhqrvyyk", "description": "\"Als het goed is, is het grootste risico een klein stapje geweest.\" Pieter Zwart, Eindbaas van Coolblue in gesprek met Humberto Tan over ondernemen voor het platform www.EYentrepreneurship.nl.", "title": "Pieter Zwart van Coolblue over ondernemen voor www.EYentrepreneurship.nl", "publishedDate": "2014-05-21T13:06:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jmU07wpZv0", "description": "DE LOOR DE SANTA MARIA\n\nMuito per dev' a Reynna\ndos ceos seer loada\nde nos, ca no mundo nada\nfoi ben come Fror d'Espynna.\n\nCa sempre santivigada \nfoi des que a fez seu padre\neno corpo de sa madre, \nu jouve des pequenynna.\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\nE ar foi de Deus amada, \nca sempre fez b\u00f5a vida,\ne de todo ben comprida\nar foi seendo menynna.\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\nE porende saudada \nfoi do angeo atanto\nque lle disso: \"Deus o santo \nde ti nacer\u00e1 agynna.\"\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\nE depois ficou prennada\nde Deus poderos' e forte,\nque por nos prendeu morte\ne resorgiu mannan\u1ef9a.\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\nE con Deus \u00e9 eixal\u00e7ada,\ne el lle deu tal vertude\nque por dar a nos saude\nno-la deu por meez\u1ef9a.\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\nE poren, Sennor onrrada, \nta mercee en mi seja\nque me leves u te veja \ndaquesta vida mesq\u1ef9a.\nMuito per dev' a Reynna......\n\n\n\n\n\nDe loor a Santa Mar\u00eda\n\n\"Por muchas cosas debemos loar a la Reina de los Cielos, pues nunca ha habido en el mundo nada mejor que esa Flor del Espino.\"\n\nQue siempre fue santificada, desde que la cre\u00f3 su padre en el cuerpo de su madre, donde yaci\u00f3 hasta nacer.\n\nDios la am\u00f3 siempre porque siempre se port\u00f3 bien, y ya de ni\u00f1a fue colmada de todos los bienes.\n\nPor eso fue a saludarla el \u00e1ngel, que le dijo: \"Dios, el Santo, nacer\u00e1 pronto de ti.\"\n\nY en seguida qued\u00f3 encinta del Dios poderoso y fuerte que sufri\u00f3 la muerte por nosotros y resucit\u00f3 al amanecer.\n\nY con Dios es ensalzada, pues \u00c9l le dio tal virtud que por darnos la salud nos la dio de medicina.\n\nY por eso, honrada Se\u00f1ora, alc\u00e1nceme tu gracia llev\u00e1ndome de esta vida mezquina adonde pueda verte.\n\n\n\n\nThis is in praise of Holy Mary. \n\n\"The Queen of Heaven should indeed be greatly praised by us, for She was born into the world like the flower of the Christ's thorn bush.\"\n\nFor She was always sanctified from the moment Her father made Her in the body of Her mother, where She lay so very small.\nAnd also She was beloved of God, for She always led a good life replete with virtuous qualities, even when She was a child. \nTherefore, She was visited by the angel who told Her: \"Holy God will be born of you soon.\" \nThen She conceived by the Strong and Mighty God who died for us and arose early one morning. \nWith God She is exalted, and He endowed Her with such power that to give us health He gave Her to us as medicine. \nTherefore, Honored Lady, may you grant me the blessing of taking me from this woeful life to where I may see you. \n\n\nPerformers: Ensemble San Felice", "title": "Cantiga 310 - Muito per dev' a Reynna", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T18:45:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6jmcdeWnRvU", "description": "For more details or to shop this Morgana dining chair set visit Hayneedle at http://www.hayneedle.com/product/morganabeigetuftedparsonsdiningchairsetof2.cfm \n\nTo view our full assortment of dining chairs, visit Hayneedle at http://www.hayneedle.com/furniture/dining-chairs_list_182364\n\nHave questions?

These tiny parasites are usually 1 to 3 millimeters in length while their eggs, called \"nits\", seen on hair shafts are a millimeter or less in size and look like tiny buds.\n\nThe insects can only crawl but are highly contagious and can spread by close personal contact, by using other peoples combs, brushes, caps and scarves.
