Breast cancer is a disease of humans and other mammals; while the overwhelming majority of cases in humans are women, men can sometimes also develop breast cancer.[2]\nThe size, stage, rate of growth, and other characteristics of the tumor determine the kinds of treatment. Treatment may include surgery, drugs (hormonal therapy and chemotherapy), radiation and/or immunotherapy.[3] Surgical removal of the tumor provides the single largest benefit, with surgery alone being capable of producing a cure in many cases. To somewhat increase the likelihood of long-term disease-free survival, several chemotherapy regimens are commonly given in addition to surgery. Most forms of chemotherapy kill cells that are dividing rapidly anywhere in the body, and as a result cause temporary hair loss and digestive disturbances. Radiation is indicated especially after breast conserving surgery and substantially improves local relapse rates and in many circumstances also overall survival.[4] Some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones such as estrogen and/or progesterone, which makes it possible to treat them by blocking the effects of these hormones.\nWorldwide, breast cancer comprises 22.9% of all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) in women.[5] In 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women).[5] Breast cancer is more than 100 times more common in women than breast cancer in men, although males tend to have poorer outcomes due to delays in diagnosis.[6][7]\nPrognosis and survival rates vary greatly depending on cancer type, staging and treatment. However, survival rates across the world are generally good.[6] Overall more than 8 out of 10 women (84%) in England that are diagnosed with the disease survive it for at least 5 years", "title": "Breast Cancer", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T05:55:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZJYnoMkE4Y", "description": "What is a totalitarian system if not one where the abject glorification of the perfect leader is matched by the surrender of all privacy and individuality, especially in matters sexual, and in denunciation and punishment \u2014 \"for their own good\" \u2014 of those who transgress?\nChristopher Hitchens", "title": "Christopher Hitchens on Atheist Minority", "publishedDate": "2010-09-15T20:28:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZJdrq7LbQ0", "description": "Trailer to a pelican, the brave bird, surf bird at the Monterey Harbor.", "title": "Brave Surf Bird", "publishedDate": "2011-10-15T06:54:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZJpXGnyfQs", "description": "", "title": "la fruta de costa rica su nombre caimito unica en centroamerica se puede decir", "publishedDate": "2014-03-14T00:14:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZJunhnBylY", "description": "COMPRALO YA \n\niTunes  --------   http://bit.ly/1lzNDlF\n\nKICHINK ----   https://www.kichink.com/buy/216725/jjentertainmentpv/\n\nSANTA RM & KRYZ (FT.

Happy belated new year! This is my first video of 2013, and no its not a video game cover, but still a great track none-the-less =D\n\nSo I had Ewan Dobson's song, \"Time 2\" stuck in my head for a few weeks. Its already an insanely popular song on youtubes (about 10 million views) that utilizes the delay pedal well, kinda reminds me of Paul Gilbert's \"Echo Song.\" =D\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed listening to his song but since the song is guitar-only, I figured why not try adding bass, drums, and rhythm to it? Now in my head, the song sounds like a 90's techno/dance/electronic type song. So that's kind of what I went for going into this cover, but I also added some power chords in there to give it a nice little touch of rock ^_^\nThis is in my opinion, my best mix so far, and I'm extremely happy with the way it came out! I hope you guys enjoy it! \n\nI'll be doing a special giveaway in the next few weeks in celebration of reaching 5,000 subscribers this year! Thank you all of you who watch/like/share my videos!

Thanks to its improved active body controls, the Mercedes Benz CL63 AMG remained absurdly unaffected by the enormous lateral g-forces generated by its gyrations. Lacking suitable anti-gravity aids, my passenger and I were thrown towards the outer radius of the turn, welded to the CL63s seat bolsters. Now thats what I call fun.\n\nThe CL63 reminds me of the rockets I designed as a kid; the Merc's a massive, sleek shape punctuated by slits and evil looking slashes. Whereas the chop top CLS-Class seems more than a little forced, the CL63 makes perfect sense. Its athletic stance, gigantic wheel arches and aggressive surface effects combine to create a coupe that looks like it eats continents\u2014 and Porsches\u2014 for breakfast.\n\nThe CL63s rear is especially effective. Framed by a Batmobile-esque rippled valence, its quad pipes give the cars rear the kind of purposefulness denied BMWs overwrought 6-Series. While both cars have so much flame surfacing they could put Burger King out of business, its the big Merc that lets me have it my way.\n\nThe CL63s interior is a bit too staid for my taste/money. That said, Affalterbachs artisans add the requisite luxury touches, including rich, soft and dense leather and a sweet smelling Alcantara roof lining. The aforementioned seat bolsters provide an unwelcome awakening for first time users, before they learn to guide their bottoms trajectory with appropriate care and precision.\n\nMercedes COMAND system remains the most intuitive of Germanys multi-media controllers\u2014 which is a bit like saying Rocky III isnt quite as terrible as Rocky V. Tweaking the seat massage functions and adjusting the air flow from the HVAC from diffuse to focused is no great challenge. Not so the eight window controls; choosing the correct button to raise or lower one of the four windows is an ergonomic lottery.\n\nIm no great fan of the massive pods enclosing the CL63s speedometer and navigation systems. While I appreciate the aeronautic theme, theres too much dash for those of us who prefer visual flight rules. AMGs 200 mph speedometer is a suitably wicked touch (that violates the spirit of Germanys gentlemens agreements), but I find it hard to read. And despite exalted specifications, the CL63s stereo sounds disappointing flat and dull.\n\nThe AMG steering wheel is neither. Its organic shape immediately attracts your hands to the correct 10 and 2 positions. The perforated leathers a bit hard to the touch, and I wish the wheel itself would adjust lower (my elbows couldnt find a suitable perch). But the obligatory paddles, crafted from thick lumps of aluminum, tell you the tillers hooked-up to some serious stones. Yes indeed.\n\nIgniting the CL63s 6.2-liter, 518 horsepower, hand built AMG engine is an orgasmic experience. The four pipes spit out a guttural roar that vibrates your soul, resonating flesh and bone like the deep registers of gigantic church organ. Revving the CL63s engine nearly breaks the sound barrier, sending children and small dogs scurrying in terror, and condemning BMWs bag of bolts V10-powered M5 to eternal sonic shame.\n\nAMG has installed this remarkable engine across virtually the entire Mercedes line. While it has transformed every chassis it has touched, it has transmogrified only two. The E63 is remarkable for its balance and, dare I say it, affordability. In the CL63, the mega-V8s acceleration turns a boulevardier into a stealth fighter, capable of cruising serenely at speeds that other vehicles struggle to achieve.\n\nMore to the point, the CL63s acceleration is exactly as youd imagine: endlessly effortless and totally telepathic. Accompanied by a Wagnerian soundtrack, the naturally aspirated powerplant does a damn fine imitation of a big-bore V12 only without the hushed progress and nose-heavy nature. In fact, at speed, Id swear the CL63 AMG was no bigger than a 911.\n\nThe CL63s steering is firm but fair. The brakes are slightly stiff but unflappable, lending confidence to aggressive driving. The CL63s ride quality is firm (theres that word again) yet compliant. Road imperfections intrude very little on the luxury experience, despite standard 20 five-spoke AMG wheels.\n\nIn short, Id trade my left arm for a Mercedes Benz CL63 AMG. Trouble is, the German automaker wants an arm AND a leg. The price of admission to AMGs leather-lined roller coaster ride: 140 large. The monthly lease cost exceeds $3k. Even in California, a mortgage payment of this magnitude still affords a pretty nice house.", "title": "Mercedes CL63 AMG Start Up,Loud Rev and Accelerating", "publishedDate": "2009-11-21T16:06:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZQpYS-WoTg", "description": "20/10/2014 : This video is about \u0e28\u0e38\u0e01\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e0a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19 : \u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\n\n\n\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d \u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e40\u0e08\u0e47\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e2d \u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e0b\u0e34\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e1a\n\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e09\u0e38\u0e19 \u0e23\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e47\u0e14\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22\u0e27\u0e41\u0e17\u0e23\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e17\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e40\u0e09\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e30\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e23\u0e39\u0e1b\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e14\u0e38\u0e25 \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21 \u0e2d\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e27\u0e19 \u0e14\u0e39\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e08\u0e19\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19\u0e04\u0e07\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e14\u0e35\n\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e04\u0e25\u0e49\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e42\u0e19 (oregano) \u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07 \u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e19\u0e01\u0e47\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e21\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e47\u0e14\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19 \u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e09\u0e38\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e01\u0e47\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e09\u0e38\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27 \u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e19\u0e33\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e17\u0e33\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e19 \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e39\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e39\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e14\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e21\u0e35\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e16\u0e38\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e44\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e40\u0e09\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e30\n\u0e19\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e44\u0e27\u0e49\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e1a\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e08\u0e34\u0e49\u0e21\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01 \u0e25\u0e32\u0e1a \u0e01\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e22\u0e33 \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e41\u0e17\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07(\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22)\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e41\u0e17\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e42\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e43\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e15\u0e27\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e04\u0e32\u0e27\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22\u0e22\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e15\u0e27\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e04\u0e32\u0e27\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35\u0e01\u0e25\u0e34\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21\n\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c : Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.)

I will quote a few ahadith first, then I will get straight to the hukm or the ruling. Many ahadith came confirming the fact that the Prophet (\ufdfa) ordered Muslim men to grow their beards and to trim their moustaches. He (\ufdfa) said in one hadith: 'Trim your moustache and save (not shave, save) the beards...by that, you are doing the opposite of what the disbelievers do.' We do it as an act of worship, we do it as a Ibadah, it's not a fashion. In another hadith he began by saying: 'Do the opposite of the Mushrikeen, save the beards, and trim the moustaches' and 'huffush Shawaaribah wa 'aful liha' is a text which is collected by both Al Bukhari or Muslim (may Allah have mercy on them) and it proves in the same context, in the same meaning and the very famous sound hadith, in which the Prophet (\ufdfa) counted ten traditions of the pure nature. It was not only prescribed by Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa), but it was there with the rest of the Prophets and the messengers before him (\ufdfa). He (\ufdfa) began by saying...trimming the moustache, saving the beard and we know that in the Quran Prophet Haroon was still in his brother Musa (alayhissalaam), when he was angry with him, at the misdoings of bani Israel when they worshipped the calf, he said, Haroon was trying to free himself from the sin of bani Israel by saying to Musa (alayhissalaam) reminding him to have mercy on him, he said...he grabbed him from his beard and from his head. So this is not an unprecedented tradition, it is a tradition that was prescribed to all the Prophets and their true followers before Muhammad (\ufdfa). It is one of the traditions of the pure nature or Al Fitrah and the Ulama (scholars) concluded from that, that growing the beard is a must, and this is a opinion of the vast, vast majority.", "title": "Men & The Beard - Islamic Advice \u1d34\u1d30 \u2507 Thought Provoking \u2507 by Sheikh Dr. Muhammad Salah \u2507 TDR \u2507", "publishedDate": "2013-09-23T00:00:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZVVpJIRDcs", "description": "The Old Wellington Hotel Annex Imploded on 8-23-14", "title": "Wellington Annex Implosion Albany, NY", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T18:25:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZVgHyemfUE", "description": "DOWNLOAD OUR DEBUT MIXTAPE, WEST SIDE STORIES, HERE: http://www.mediafire.com/?h5dq5b6bo895ed7\nLIKE Upper West: http://www.facebook.com/UpperWestMusic\nFree Download Here: http://soundcloud.com/upperwest/wouldntitbe\nAdapted from Heaven by Los Lonely Boys", "title": "Wouldn't It Be- Upper West", "publishedDate": "2011-09-01T22:46:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZW-GP77qWQ", "description": "Huge mesenteric cyst", "title": "Mesenteric cyst", "publishedDate": "2012-03-16T21:01:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZWZKdN_Igk", "description": "Katie Fitzpatrick", "title": "ASL Retell Story \"Safe Keeping\"", "publishedDate": "2009-08-02T00:47:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZWZRVwtZYE", "description": "Medical Office Administration/ Medical Coding @ PTI: http://www.pti.edu/school_healthcare_medical_office.php or call: 1.800.784.9675\n\nThe Medical Office Administration program at Pittsburgh Technical Institute provides a wide range of management and customer service skills as they relate to the smooth and efficient operation of a medical office or specialty practice.", "title": "Day as a Medical Office Administrator/ Medical Coder", "publishedDate": "2013-01-29T16:24:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZWvIOvmKAQ", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "ay ay ay ay..", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T02:44:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZXCsMqQhDI", "description": "BOO is watching a scary movie the night before Halloween when the door bell rings.", "title": "Jack-O-Lantern", "publishedDate": "2009-09-04T06:14:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZXcaFkfUpE", "description": "Animals - Cats - a cute Ragdoll Cat with blue eyes,\nI created this video editing 2 creative commons video in the youtube video editor tool\nhere you can find the original videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGNoB1C3J34\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhkSvz6oAE\n\nAnimali - Gatti - un tenero gatto ragdoll con gli occhi azzurri,\nho creato questo video tramite l'editor video di youtube\n\nBy Jack Animals\n\nGoogle+\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/109260688994340706300/posts\n\nvisit my website (about photoshop tutorials)\nhttp://shadowtutorials.altervista.org", "title": "Cute Ragdoll Cat with Blue Eyes (Gatto con occhi azzurri)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T11:12:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ZYRgehIIVg", "description": "Music video by Shontelle performing Perfect Nightmare.

Whatever the reason the atmosphere says it all, its a beautiful July summer evening in Southern Europe, people are on summer holiday and enjoying themselves. We find ourselves on the Greek Island of Kos, in Kos Town, well actually in the Kos Town Harbour. My wife and I have rented bicycles and are out for an evening bicycle ride around Kos Town and its harbour. The Kos Harbour is the center part of the city in the evening and with its fantastic bicycle roads (as in most of Kos Town) it is a fantastic place for an evening ride. We are sitting on a bench in the harbour just watching the world go by. Watch out for the big Blue Star Lines ferry leaving Kos Harbour. Also take note of the lovely bicycle tracks the city offers residents and tourists. Its definitely worthwhile renting a bicycle when visiting Kos Town. Hope this video gives you a little feeling of the lovely summer evening atmosphere we experienced while sitting in the Kos Town Harbour one July.\n\nHope you enjoy the video.

Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver who hopes to some day open his own limo company; one night behind the wheel begins promisingly when he picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), an attorney working with the federal government who is attractive, friendly, and gives him her business card after paying her fare. Max thinks his luck is getting even better when his next fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise), offers him several hundred dollars in cash if he'll be willing to drop him off, wait, and pick him up at five different spots over the course of the evening. Max agrees, but he soon realizes Vincent isn't just another guy with errands to run -- Vincent is an assassin who has been paid to murder five people who could put the leaders of a powerful drug trafficking ring behind bars in an upcoming trial. As circumstances force Max to do Vincent's bidding, the cabbie has to find a way to prevent Vincent from killing again and save his own skin, a task that becomes especially crucial when he discovers Annie is one of the names on Vincent's hit list. Collateral also stars Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill as police detectives hot on Vincent's trail.\n\ncollateral,\"collateral clip\",\"collateral trailer\",\"collateral soundtrack\",\"collateral damage\",\"collateral club scene\",\"tom cruise\",\"jamie foxx\",\"michael mann\",\"briefcase videos\",\"gun videos\",\"crime dramas\",\"crime thrillers\",thriller,\"michael doven\",\"gusmano cesaretti\",\"bryan h carroll\",\"michael waxman\",\"frank darabont\",\"julie herrin\",\"aggression videos\",\"authority videos\",\"defiance videos\",\"freeway videos\",max,vincent,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++288532,/m/07r1h,/m/01wmxfs", "title": "Collateral (7/9) Movie CLIP - Max Takes Action (2004) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T05:00:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Zq7Ds8Rhqw", "description": "How to use glaze to give painted furniture an antiqued finish.

The answer is no. There are many,\nmany risk factors that can lead for somebody to get skin cancer.\n\nThe risk factors will be determined, based on whether it's melanoma or non-\nmelanoma. Melanoma is more common in people who have fair or white skin,\npeople who have blue eyes, who have red hair, people who've had a\nblistering sunburn in the past, people who have an unusual amount of moles,\nand people who have had skin cancer in the past or have had a family member\nwith skin cancer.\n\nThis list is significantly shorter for basal cell and squamous cell\ncarcinomas.

Media reports say the four later boasted about the rape to other school children and sent copies of the video to friends.\nPolice who detained the four earlier this week have so far not found any film footage of the alleged rape. There is suspicion the video pictures may have been erased and mobile phones of the suspects are being analysed by experts in a bid to retrieve any pictures.\n\"This brutal rape has shocked Germany,\" said a commentary in Berlin\u2019s B.Z. newspaper. \nAdding to the potential explosiveness of the alleged rape is the fact that the four suspects are all the children of immigrant families, while the victim is German.\nThe normally well-informed Bild tabloid said the suspects were two German-Turks, a German Russian and a German-Angolan.\nFederal police statistics released on Monday show non-German youths under the age of 21 were twice as likely to be crime suspects last year than German nationals of the same age.\nOfficers in charge of the case are convinced the four youths carried out the gang the rape and DNA tests are being carried on sperm traces found on the victim.\nGiven the brutality of the attack, there has been anger over a decision by Berlin justice officials to order the youths be set free.\nThe 13-year-old suspect is too young to be kept in detention under German law, but the other three could be held.\n\nBerlin justice Senator Karin Schubert insists, however, that even youths suspected of violent crimes can only be kept locked up if there is danger they will flee justice. \nA commentary in the newspaper Die Welt termed the move \"shocking\" and asked: \"What about protecting the victim? What about overall security?\"\nThe newspaper added: \"The girl who was raped can now meet up with her suspected rapists on any street corner.\"\nOpposition politicians and Germany\u2019s police trade union have long criticized the leftist Berlin government\u2019s insistence that young violent crime suspects and even convicted criminals be kept out of prison.\n\"Someone who does something like this must be locked away ... regardless of how old they are,\" said Frank Henkel, the secretary general of Berlin\u2019s opposition Christian Democrats\nLast year the city was witness to the horrifying murder of a seven-year-old child who was beaten to death by a 17-year-old who said he carried out the crime due to \"boredom\".\nThe perpetrator of the crime - carried out in a park in the well-to-do Zehlendorf district - had been released few months earlier after nearly beating a young army recruit to death. \nJustice Senator Schubert defended the city\u2019s justice officials in this case by saying that protecting victims was not a reason to keep suspects in detention before they had been convicted of a crime.\nSome 50 per cent of all violent crime in Berlin is carried out by people aged under 21 years, official figures show.\nBut even for youths convicted of violent crime, Schubert says prison terms are only a \"last resort\" and that the emphasis must remain on rehabilitation and resocialization.\n\nhttp://www.expatica.com/de/news/local_news/shock-in-berlin-as-suspected-rapists-freed-30050.html", "title": "Turks, Angolan, Russian Youth Rape German Minor in Berlin", "publishedDate": "2014-10-21T17:35:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_0wvwgrnYk", "description": "Victrola for sale by Victor-Victrola.com", "title": "Victrola XVI \"L-door\"", "publishedDate": "2012-11-23T22:31:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_0xqenZH7g", "description": "Subscribe now for more videos: http://bit.ly/subscribejammer\n\nLady Grey is the first single from Katzenjammer's new album 'Rockland'. \n\nBuy it now:\niTunes - http://smarturl.it/Lady-Grey-iTunes\nGoogle Play - http://smarturl.it/Lady-Grey-Google\nAmazon Digital - http://smarturl.it/Lady-Grey-Amazon\n\nStream it:\nSpotify - http://spoti.fi/1xCxebm\n\nKatzenjammer are nothing if not distinctive. Formed at an Oslo music school in 2005, the four girls play a diverse blend of country, folk, blues, pop and rock. From Tennessee\u2019s Bonnaroo to Australia\u2019s Woodford Folk Festival, the quartet have enraptured tens-of-thousands with their genre-mixing, instrument-swapping and riotous shows. \n\nTheir 2008 debut, Le Pop, showed that they were as fun on record as live and 2011\u2019s A Kiss Before You Go was a symphonic journey through the emotions, full of vigour and vocal harmonies. Throughout this all they have done things their own way. \n\nRockland is undoubtedly their most refined and accomplished effort so far. \u201cWe wanted to go back to the roots and be more stripped and not add all these symphonic things,\u201d says Anne Marit. The moods ebb and flow throughout; from the bass-heavy and rapped \u2018Oh My God\u2019 to more serene and melody-led tracks like \u2018My Own Tune\u2019 and \u2018Lady Grey\u2019. Yet this is no bare-bones record. It is still unmistakably Katzenjammer; a more focused version of the adventure and unbounded excitement for which they are known. \n\nEach member travelled across the world to write songs for Rockland, including separate visits to Nashville for Anne Marit and Marianne and to London for Solveig. A staggering total of 83 songs was the result, though this was reduced to the eleven which make up Rockland. With these they have managed to distil their essence at its purest. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of even closer to what we want Katzenjammer to be because it\u2019s directly from the source of the band,\u201d says Solveig.", "title": "Lady Grey (Lyric Video) - Katzenjammer", "publishedDate": "2014-11-18T17:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_1Dbg2555A", "description": "This video was created as part of the Center's effort to study the effects of physical and outdoor play.

In addition, Belgium, like most of the rest of the world, doesn't have a wealth tax and the inheritance tax on property in Belgium is between zero and seven percent, whereas in France it is much higher,'' tax lawyer Mano\u00ebl Dekeyser said. \n\nThe Louis Vuitton chief has said he will go on paying tax in France for the moment. That may change if President Francois Hollande carries out his election pledge to squeeze the rich. \n\nIn Brussels, some say the number of those fleeing higher taxes from abroad is rising. Estate Agent Caroline Lucidi-Joubert, who hunts the choicest properties in Brussels for the rich told euronews: ''The people who come are younger and younger. Families with children, aged around 40 or 50. There are also those who've retired, who've stopped work and want to protect their assets.'' \n\nAlain Lefebvre is French but moved to Belgium to avoid paying capital gains on his large share portfolio. Today, he publishes a magazine for French expatriates. He is deeply critical of how his homeland treats risk takers. \n\n''We are very egalitarian in France. We don't like shows-offs or big-heads, or people who succeed. We don't like entrepreneurs. Boss is a dirty word,'' Lefebvre said. \n\nBut don't be fooled. Belgium is no tax haven. While capital gains might be low compared to France, income is taxed at around 50 percent, one of Europe's highest rates.\n\nFind us on:  \nYoutube http://bit.ly/zr3upY \nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fans\nTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews", "title": "Belgians unhappy over Louis Vuitton boss' nationality bid", "publishedDate": "2012-09-14T18:34:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_6nNxjq_q0", "description": "For the latest issue of talkSPORT magazine, visit http://talksport.net/mag", "title": "Carlos Cuellar mugs off the Aston Villa groundsman!", "publishedDate": "2010-06-07T16:56:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_6wKMJC-4M", "description": "The oxidation of an aldehyde (butanal) to a carboxylic acid (butanoic acid) using Cr2O7 2- as the catalyst !\nBy Mbita and Brittany", "title": "Oxidation of an Aldehyde", "publishedDate": "2011-11-25T04:38:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_70HViwdG0", "description": "gestes techniques fifa 13 super pour \u00e9nerver son adversaire", "title": "fifa 13 comment faire gestes techniques incroyable coup du foulard (rabona) + autres gestes", "publishedDate": "2013-02-17T19:20:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_7SGr5YdkM", "description": "Crystal Maiden finishes her chores in close to 3 seconds.\nThis video was made possible by a user submission.

'Gukurahundi' is a Shona word which means 'the rain washes away chaff'.\n\nThe genocide claimed the lives of more than 20 000 people in Matabeleland and Midlands regions. Historian, Sidumo Bhebhe said the commemorations are vital as they remind the people of the atrocities that were committed by the Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) - ZANU PF to the people of Matabeleland.\n\n'The commemorations remind us of our brothers, sisters, mothers and father who perished in the hands of ZANU PF.'\n\nBhebhe further pointed out that the government that will take after the government of National unity shall have a mammoth task in fostering national unity.", "title": "Bulawayo: Ndebele people bust marginalisation", "publishedDate": "2012-04-15T17:47:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_MAru3-MLM", "description": "\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b The Belch.\n\u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\n\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430: The Belch\nThe Belch,  punk, metal, the belch band, vip, luxury, cocaine, Rock'n'Roll, Post-Hardcore, Post-Rock, Moscow, Rock Band\nhttps://belchband.bandcamp.com/ \nhttp://vk.com/the_belch\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thebelch \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thebelch", "title": "The Belch - Go (Official Music Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T13:53:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_MRImf4LNM", "description": "Video I created for my Texas History class to explain the concept of Primary and Secondary sources.", "title": "Primary and Secondary Sources Video", "publishedDate": "2012-09-09T19:56:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3_Mx8vye6W8", "description": "These are only some of the many Smart Ways to Live!

The festival is celebrated on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight of the month of Bhadra (August-September) in the Hindu calendar. Rasa lila, dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna, are a special feature in regions of Mathura and Vrindavan, and regions following Vaishnavism in Manipur. While the Rasa lila re-creates the flirtatious aspects of Krishna's youthful days, the Dahi Handi celebrate God's playful and mischievous side, where teams of young men form human pyramids to reach a high-hanging pot of butter and break it. This tradition, also known as uriadi, is a major event in Tamil Nadu on Gokulashtami. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and staying up until midnight, the time when Krishna is believed to have been born. Images of Krishna's infancy are placed in swings and cradles in temples and homes. At midnight devotees gather around for devotional songs, dance and exchange gifts. Some temples also conduct reading of the Hindu religious scripture Bhagavad Gita. \n\nVrindavan alternatively spelled as Vrindaban, Brindavan, Brindavana, or Brundavan and also known as Vraj is a town in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is the site of an ancient forest which is the region where according to the Mahabharata, a grand Epic of Sanskrit literature dating back to the 3000BC, the deity Krishna spent his childhood days. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place according to traditions of Hinduism. The major tradition followed in the area is Vaisnavism, and it is a center of learning with many Vrindavan Ashrams operating. It's a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like Govardhana and Gokul that are associated with Krishna. Many millions of bhaktas or devotees of Radha Krishna visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth. \n\nThe town is about 10 km away from Mathura, the city of Lord Krishna's birthplace, near the Agra-Delhi highway. The town hosts hundreds of temples dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna and is considered sacred by a number of religious traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Vaishnavism, and Hinduism in general. Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu history, and is an important Hindu pilgrimage site. One of its oldest surviving temples is the Govinda Dev temple, built in 1590, with the town founded earlier in the same century. It is believed that the essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna's transcendent pastimes. Chaitanya wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavana in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, He was able locate all the important places of Krishna's pastimes in and around Vrindavana.\nIn the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanization, first by local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has been eliminated or are close to it. A few peacocks and monkeys can be seen found but cows are now only found in the goshalas of the Major Ashrams of Vrindavan.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

A NASA advisory said the cyclone was comparable to a category 3 hurricane.\nTyphoon Jelawat to impact Taiwan, Japan\n\nThe cyclone has lost some of its might and should continue weakening while moving into colder waters, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. Wind troughs out of China could divert Jelawat away from land and into the open Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis has not kept Okinawa from feeling the might of Jelawat's gusts, although there have been no reports of major damage.\n\n\"The winds are screaming through the streets,\" storm chaser James Reynolds said from Okinawa before the typhoon strike. \"I've seen at least one window blow out.\"\n\nHe explained that buildings on the island are constructed to withstand the frequent Pacific typhoons. Just two weeks ago, Sanba, a Category 3 storm with slightly stronger winds than the current typhoon, passed over Okinawa on its way to South Korea.\n\nLocal media reported Jelawat's gusts had overturned motor vehicles.\n\nA U.S. Air Force base on the island recorded a gust of 180 mph, Maginnis said.\n\nThe base lost its American Forces Network television signal, according to one photo post with a descriptive caption saying the storm \"decided to make a taco out of one of our satellite dish.\"\n\nThe page held a contest for the best storm picture. Potential winning images -- containing the worst damage -- displayed a single car that the wind had overturned and roof damage to a home.", "title": "EXTREME WEATHER: Powerful TYPHOON Jelawat STRIKES Japan!

It uses the electronic controller of an induction cooker. The main specification of Great Efficiency GENERATOR is that it uses a BIFILAR PANCAKE COIL patented by Nikolas TESLA in 1894 patent N\u00b0 512,340.\n\nIn the GEGENE the flat bifilar coil is electromagnetically coupled with the main flat coil of the induction cooker and acts as the secundary coil for the output. The driving and the controlling are fully done by the main electronic controller of the induction cooker itself. You need only : an induction cooker, a dual flexible speaker wire and some electrical connectors and plugs. At the GEGENE ouput you must connect resistive and non inductive loads such as halogen lamps... \n\nIn this test,I have used 7 halogen lamps 500W EACH FOR 3500WATT load\n\nRESULTS \n\nAgainst measure the voltage output, maybe because is OVER 600 volt the current is 6.0 AMP for powering the halogen lamps SO 600VOLT * 6.0 AMP=3600WATT.\n\nThe electrical power input of the induction cooker is measured 233 VOLT AND 4.30 AMP =1001WATT\n\nEl Gegene un gran generador de eficiencia con una bobina bifilar Tesla. \n\nAqu\u00ed es un experimento sobre un generador el\u00e9ctrico de alta potencia que es capaz de producir alg\u00fan KW. Utiliza el controlador electr\u00f3nico de una cocina de inducci\u00f3n. La principal caracter\u00edstica de Gran GENERADOR Eficiencia es que utiliza una bobina plana bifilar patentado por Nikolas Tesla en 1894 la patente N \u00b0 512340. \n\nEn la Gegene la bobina bifilar plana se acopla electromagn\u00e9ticamente con la bobina principal plana de la cocina de inducci\u00f3n y act\u00faa como la bobina secundario para la salida. La conducci\u00f3n y el control est\u00e1n completamente hechos por el principal controlador electr\u00f3nico de la propia cocina de inducci\u00f3n.

I was a sponsor of the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act, which [President] George Bush signed back in 1990. I know a little bit about this. But America is confronting a sequestration that will have devastating impact on our economy, on every individual in America and on international confidence in America's ability to manage itself. And what have we spent two days on? A quarter percent cap on cost-of-living adjustment for federal employees. A quarter of a percent. \n\n\"Some of us in this body earn that in about 10 minutes. Not all of us, but some of us. Yet, we fiddle while America faces a sequester burn. And sequester is Republican policy. July 19, 2011, 'Cut, Cap and Balance' was brought to this Floor. 98% of Republicans - 229 - voted for it. What was the fallback position? Sequester -- an irrational policy that cuts across the board, irrespective of priority. And so what does the Majority in this Congress do? It has now wasted two weeks on debate of nickel-diming the people we rely on to protect our domestic safety, our international security, our food and drugs, our health care, our borders. \n\n\"I join in the remarks of my good friend, Frank Wolf. He and I have been here 32 years. We have some understanding of what is proper and not proper in terms of managing the government. Now, the sponsor of this legislation has been here approximately 45 days. Forty five days and he introduces a bill to cap by a quarter of a percent federal employees. \n\n\"The animosity directed at our federal employees is so great that we have now taken two weeks to try to diminish their pay and benefits. How sad. While the sequester looms 14 days from today, putting at risk , as I said, America's economy, the creation of American jobs, the sense of confidence in our country and the perception around the world that America is a serious country.

This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service.

Es una hernia muy com\u00fan en ni\u00f1os y adultos, especialmente obesos y en mujeres. La protrusi\u00f3n involucra al intestino delgado, peritoneo y epipl\u00f3n, y otras v\u00edsceras y conlleva una elevada incidencia de estrangulaci\u00f3n del contenido herniado. Entre todas las hernias, se presentan en un 2% de los casos.Se hace visible por encima y por fuera de la cicatriz umbilical en la forma de un abultamiento ovalado sobre el ombligo, ocasionalmente doloroso. Adem\u00e1s del examen cl\u00ednico, no es com\u00fan hacer otros examenes para diagnosticar una hernia umbilical.Ocasionalmente se ve asociada a diastasis, es decir, separaci\u00f3n de los m\u00fasculos rectos del abdomen.\n\nTratamiento: Hernioplastia umbilical\nSolo una operaci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica puede resolver una hernia umbilical. Para las hernias m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as, la operaci\u00f3n se hace con anestesia local. Para las hernias m\u00e1s grandes y complejas, la operaci\u00f3n ocurre bajo anestesia general. Se justifica la reparaci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica en ni\u00f1os si hay evidencia de estrangulamiento de los componentes herniados o el defecto es muy grande y est\u00e9ticamente notable despu\u00e9s de los 3 o 4 a\u00f1os.

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin B12 or folate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two-thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B12 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease, hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Red blood cell distribution width", "publishedDate": "2014-08-05T09:42:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3a9WoqT6zXE", "description": "A Penguin Gets A Big Surprise While Digging.....", "title": "A CP Comedy ~ Digging In The Snow", "publishedDate": "2014-04-10T20:18:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "3a9ZIR8Ptic", "description": "Avec s\u00e9verine Roy, Tony, ...", "title": "Drift circuit Pusey-Vesoul", "publishedDate": "2009-07-09T14:32:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3a9ik-N8EKE", "description": "Tempera de uma lamina", "title": "Temperar uma lamina", "publishedDate": "2010-05-01T10:12:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3a9jGKyH0vo", "description": "Merrick and Sophie interview Emma Stone and they have a little surprise... a message from their mate Mel B!

The discussion about whether the lynx should be re-introduced in some of its original habitats has as many supporters as it has opponents. And that also applies to other animals...\nThe Lynx is easily recognized for their tuft of hair at the tip of each ear at least one inch in length or longer. These ear tufts help them in securing their wild prey unannounced. The Lynx has a short, stubby tail which is black at the tip.\nAn adult lynx weighs up ot 40 kilos. Here, too, the female is a little smaller. The lynx lives a secluded life in the large forest areas and avoids contact with people. It prefers to live in almost impenetrable rocky areas, hiding in caves. By day it usually rests or cleans its fur.\nAt dusk and at night the lynx hunts rabbits, hares and even roe deer.\n\nmusic dedicated to the public domain (Creative Commons Zero) freePD chillchinalove", "title": "lynx - felis lynx - eurasian lynx #02", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T05:50:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "3aQMxEbcxGI", "description": "Today News Rates of amyloid buildup in the brain accelerate and then decelerate before reaching a plateau, providing a possible 15year window of opportunity for intervention to prevent Alzheimers disease (AD), according to a new study that used a sophisticated. end of the news.

It appears often in Creation myths, in the ancient cosmology and as an important iconographic element in the artwork of varied cultures across America. The use of the tree as a cosmic symbol exists on a wide and diverse scale in cultures from the Viking World Tree (Yggdrasil) - as well as in the Jewish Tree of Sephirot. The Mayan World Tree represents the four directions of the world, where the tree itself is the center -The Mondi axis is the point where earth and sky meet with the perpendicular and horizontal axis of the world.\n\nThe symbol originates from the world view that aspires towards logical order in the chaotic Universe. This understanding creates an ordered microcosmos where there is a defined center. From the center, we can turn to each of the cardinal directions in search of knowledge, wisdom and new discoveries. However , outside of this world, there is chaos, night and death. The image of the tree represents the symbolic axis that unites the three planes: The sky (branches), the earth (the trunk) and the lower world (the roots). Every object that  is hanging on the tree represents  the tension between the underworld and the upper world and in this way turns into a very strong symbol of the storehouse of knowledge and wisdom. Often, in Mayan art, there are images of birds sitting on the tree representing an ancient father , while the tree's roots are in the water- a symbol of the underworld.\n\n The Image of the Mayan World Tree is an accurate depiction of the Ceiba Tree with it's bottle like trunk covered with thorns which reminded the ancient Mayan people the body of a crocodile. The crocodile tree became a symbol of the cosmos or the Milky way and the reason that I chose this symbol is because it is one of the first human symbols of the cosmos and because we are all eventually Starchildren. Every atom in our body came straight out of the furnaces of long forgotten supernovas in the far regions of space.\n\nThis is a powerful symbol because it actually depicts pure consciousness - it shows the human being, the starchild looking and trying to understand itself - the universe.", "title": "The Ancient Mayan World Tree", "publishedDate": "2013-12-18T06:58:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3aRgqE7VeXM", "description": "dopo il vomito, le tipe da sblallo e i bicchieri di cristallo, ci godiamo pochi secondi dello spettacolo offerto sulla riviera ROMAGNOLA.", "title": "FUOCHI alla spiaggia del mojto!!

Eating protein can increase production of neurotransmitters like dopamine or norepinephrine, which are essential for alertness, high-speed calculation, and critical thinking.\n\nTip\nSave complex carbohydrates, like whole grains and pasta, for your evening meal, when they\u2019ll help you fall asleep.\n\nStep 2: Eat dark chocolate\nEnjoy between one and five ounces of dark chocolate a day. Its antioxidants increase blood flow to the brain, making learning easier, improving your memory, and helping you think faster. Choose chocolate with more than 70 percent cocoa.\n\nStep 3: Eat small meals\nEat several small meals per day rather than three big ones. Or chew each mouthful of food 30 times before swallowing. Both of these routines reduce the amount of oxygen the brain needs to digest your food, leaving more oxygen for alertness and memory.\n\nStep 4: Eat your Bs\nEat more foods that are high in B vitamins, like green, leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, whole-wheat bread, and beans. Studies link B vitamins with increased mental acuity.\n\nStep 5: Switch things up\nExercise your brain by doing everyday things differently, like using your non-dominant hand for routine tasks. This will force your brain to form new neural pathways, increasing its power.\n\nTip\nAn excellent brain booster you can do anywhere is to count backward from 90, in threes.\n\nStep 6: Get some exercise\nGet more aerobic exercise, which has been shown to actually increase brain cells. Walking briskly just three hours a week helps.\n\nDid You Know?\nSome researchers contend that your genes are responsible for 50 percent of your intelligence.

Why would such a fool believe in that? That makes no sense!\n Selena: YEAH! A stronger government would protect us.\n Karina: No, In order for you to rule you would need a military, which would be tyranny!  \n narrator(selena):this is when things started to heat up.\nAdora: We would use militias. This would help wayyy more than your big military. If we have the states rule themselves, it would be so much easier. \nSelena: I object this is all nonsense, a militia is the dumbest idea i have ever heard! How could that keep these citizens under control? They deserve freedom and i will give that to them.\nAdora: With a militia they can fix the problem faster because they will be in the area. If we had one big government It would take so much longer for problems to be solved. Lets get away from the military. What will you do when your government falls? \nSelena: ummmmmmmmmm....\nAdora: exactly!  If we had smaller governments in the states  and one states failed the rest would be fine.\nSelena: Thats stupid! We all should be equal so if one falls we all fall.\nAdora: NO No NO NO NO NO NO NO! Each state should take care of themselves, they shouldn't be worrying about the others. If one state falls its their fault.\nSelena: that doesn't seem fair\nAdora: yeah it does, if your government fails everything fails. If we have smaller governments in each state and one fails, it would just be that state.\n\nSelena: lets move past this\nAdora: uhh no!\n*selena pushes papers off desk dramatically and stands up*\n*adora does same thing*\nSelena: You are such a moron!

Each branch represents a different aspect of the people, and because all three branches are equal, no one group can assume control over another.\nSelena: Really, we think that the executive branch has too much power.\nKarina: this is why we have the branches separated, so no one cant take control of another. \nAdora: I just said that!\nKarina:ok sorry, calm down!\nAdora: soooo you got anything to say?\nChristian: ummmmmm\nSelena: ummmmmm...\nAdora: sooooo we won!\n*adora and karina high-five* \nSelena: woah! woah!

It is commonly and officially[9] regarded as one of the greatest anime of all time. The anime was created by Gainax, written and directed by Hideaki Anno, and co-produced by TV Tokyo and Nihon Ad Systems (NAS).\n\nEvangelion is an apocalyptic mecha action series which centers around the efforts by the paramilitary organization NERV to fight monstrous beings called Angels, primarily using giant mecha called Evangelions which are piloted by select teenagers, one of whom is the primary protagonist. It follows those teenagers and other NERV members until the defeat of the Angels and the eventual apocalyptic ending.\n\nEvents in the series refer to Judeo-Christian symbols from the book of Genesis and Biblical apocrypha among others. Later episodes shift focus to psychoanalysis of the main characters, who display various emotional problems and mental illnesses; the nature of existence and reality are questioned in a way that lets Evangelion be characterized as \"postmodern fantasy\". Hideaki Anno, the director of the anime series, had suffered from clinical depression prior to creating the series, and the psychological aspects of the show are based on the director's own experiences with overcoming this illness.\n\nIn the original Japanese, the word \"Evangelion\" is pronounced with a hard g per its Greek roots (see Translation notes on the title below).\n\nSource: wikipedia.org", "title": "Neon Genesis Evangelion OST 2 - Spending Time in Preparation", "publishedDate": "2008-05-27T23:02:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3aeDv2uShLE", "description": "Official video of Vitaly streaking World Cup http://youtu.be/yeThbsErE2E   Subscribe to Vitaly http://www.youtube.com/vitalyzdtv \nFollow me on Instagram @DennisRoady\nLearn How To Prank http://bit.ly/howtoPRANKitup\n\nVitalyZDTV Pranks the World Cup 2014!!

The current gold standard, the Goldmann applanation tonometer, is influenced by ocular parameters, both extrinsic and intrinsic, that can lead to long- and short-term fluctuations and measurement errors. The biggest of all limitations of Goldmann-type tonometers is that the device provides a cross-sectional picture of IOP levels. To get an overall picture, including nocturnal IOP estimates, a home tonometry unit can provide valuable information. This article discusses the various sources that influence IOP measurement, home tonometers that are currently available, and the growing body of evidence that shows how home tonometry can be helpful in the care of individuals at risk for progression of glaucoma.\n\nRead the original review paper here: http://www.dovepress.com/assessing-the-need-and-benefits-of-home-tonometers-in-the-management-o-peer-reviewed-article-OPTO", "title": "Intraocular pressure and home tonometry-Video abstract 31705", "publishedDate": "2013-07-30T22:30:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3aqaRM2lF8k", "description": "The burned man and Ulysses.

He is suffering from cancer of the oesophagus, has described his illness as \"a bit of a yawn\" and accepted that it is a result of his hard drinking and smoking lifestyle. He has been told that he has only a one in 20 chance of living for longer than five years. \n\nHe said he was not surprised by the diagnosis, which came earlier this summer, and said: \"If you've led a rather bohemian and rackety life, as I have, it's precisely the cancer that you'd expect to get\" \"I think my main fear is of being incapacitated or imbecilic at the end. That, of course, is not something to be afraid of, it's something to be terrified of\" \"But for my family it's not very nice. I could wish perhaps to have led a more healthy and upright life for their sake, and that's a very melancholy reflection, of course...I feel a sense of waste about it because I'm not ready\"\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/12/In-Memoriam-Christopher-Hitchens-19492011 Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

This can be traced back to material properties and correction demand in the machine settings. \nWith a pneumatic fibre switch and a suction drum from X-Floc you can switch injection hose between blow-in and suction/aspiration mode. The fibre switch has a remote control. The blockage can be solved and wil be transported in the suction drum. The aspiration air can be taken directly from the insulation blowing machines M99, EM300, EM400 and EM500.

Following in the tradition of Harvey Kurtzmans Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat, Goodwins stories reflected the human realities and personal costs of war rather than exploiting the clich\u00e9s of the traditional mens adventure genre. They were among the best comics stories about war ever published.\n\nBlazing Combat ended after its fourth issue when military post exchanges refused to sell the title due to their perception that it was an anti-war comic. Their hostility was fueled by the depiction of the then-current Vietnam War, especially a story entitled Landscape, which follows the thoughts of a simple Vietnamese peasant rice-farmer who pays the ultimate price simply for living where he does \u2014 and which was considered anti-war agitprop by the more hawkish members of the business community.\n\nWriter Archie Goodwin and the original publisher James Warren discuss the death of Blazing Combat and market censorship as well as the creative gestation of the series in exclusive interviews.\n\nShips in: April 2010 (subject to change)", "title": "Blazing Combat (Softcover Edition) - video preview", "publishedDate": "2010-03-13T06:12:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bFnwzy4pvA", "description": "Boat report on the Fairline Targa 62 GT, part of our Stars of Southampton special featured in the November 2012 issue of Motor Boat & Yachting.

The closer the viewer approaches, the more unrealistic the image becomes. The movements of the viewer distort the images -- they are delayed, speeded up, manipulated, fragmented or frozen. The viewer cannot pin down his digital twin. The asynchrony of real time and image time distances the viewer from his digital image and enables him to see himself in different guises -- fragmented, fractured or from behind. Acoustic signals are linked to the image processing system and mark the position from which the user can influence his computergenerated image using gestures and changes of position. Rigid Waves uses interactive media technology to represent the separation of body and perception alluded to by Echo and Narcissus in the myth of Ovid's metamorphoses.\nIn the installation, the viewer himself disturbs the illusion of symmetry between the physical world and the lookingglass world. Image algorithms produce an alienating effect that undermine the photo realism of the live video image, the linearity of the timeline is interrupted and the digital image seems to break up into a thousand fragments.\n\nArtists / Authors: Monika Fleischmann, Wolfgang Strauss\n\nCooperator: Christian-Arved Bohn\n\nOrigination: Germany, 1993\nhttp://fleischmann-strauss.de\nhttp://netzspannung.org/database/rigid-waves\nhttp://netzspannung.org/about/mars/projects/", "title": "Rigid Waves - Narcissus and Echo (1993) by Monika Fleischmann & Wolfgang Strauss", "publishedDate": "2007-05-07T12:56:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bJ_BSmK-hI", "description": "Copyright of PBS Masterpiece Classic.

The 42-year-old bombshell, whose 'booty' measures 60in, says she has spent the last 20 years drastically enhancing her body. The Miami-based entertainer, who was born a male, even claims to have paved the way for curvy stars Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj. But despite achieving her quest to become the 'Body Goddess' there has been plenty of tragedy along the way. Many of her friends have been maimed and paralysed and some have even died following risky procedures.

The cyclist is at the centre of the project and ergonomic studies have analyzed his/her positions during the race and the interaction of the various body parts with the saddle.\n\nAll the models in the SMP range have the same patented characteristics in common, such as the original beak of the saddle nose, designed to provide a flat base for the efforts while sitting during long climbs and as a relief during the descents, offering better control of the bike with the thighs.\n\nThe particular shape of the SMP saddle is not only ergonomic; the original profile and its soft lines make it particularly elegant. A component that improves increasingly more sophisticated bikes.\n\nThe length of the bars makes installation particularly easy on practically any combination of seat frame/upright.\n\nThe central channel in the saddle is an uncommon characteristic because of its size: almost a whole hand can pass through it and it allows anus, prostate, pudendal veins, deep dorsal penis artery and vein, scrotum and testicles for men and small and large lips and clitoris for women, not to be squashed. Air can circulate also around the private parts and this prevents that unpleasant hot sensation.\n\nA cyclist sits on an SMP saddle with his/her glutei and the lower part of his/her pelvis (ischiatic tuberosities) and the position is determined by the shape of his/her bottom that, apart from preventing crushing the coccyx on rough terrain, allows soft standing and sitting from the back when the terrain requires it.\n\nFacebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/milleaccendinifunpage\nYoutube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/milleaccendini\nSito:\nhttp://www.magiamagia.org/\ntwitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/milleaccendinit\n\nLa sella SMP Glider 2013 \u00e8 ideale sia per le attivit\u00e0 sportive che per le pedalate nel tempo libero.\n\nUtilizza la medesima struttura della Sella SMP Composit combinata per\u00f2 con una comoda ed abbondante imbottitura.\n\nE' rivestita in vera pelle per le versioni di colore nero e Microfibra di Lorica per le versioni colorate e presenta caratteristiche \"all-round\" ottimali, ed \u00e8 particolarmente adatto per i bacini dalla conformazione anatomica nella media.\n\nLa sella SMP Glider \u00e8 imbottita in elastomero nei punti di appoggio di tuberosit\u00e0 ischiatica e glutei.

You should know that paying the bail via bonds is effective than cash because with cash payment for bail, the county shall cut the costs associated with court and fines that may be incurred while being in jail. Using the Los Angeles bondsman, no amount is subject to be subtracted. For those who reside in Los Angeles CA, bail bonds should not be a new terminology. For others, we would like to explain some basic terms associated with the whole process. \n\nIf you have come across the unlucky experience of being caught up in jail or are looking for ways through which you can send bail of your friend or any family member, you should know that by bailing you are in essence pledging with the court to release the person who has been detained. Usually, the most common class who is willing to indemnify include the insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions. Other than this, there are bail bond agents whose sole business is to release the defendants of criminal nature usually in a couple of hours only. This is in essence the same as a surety bond being fulfilled by the Los Angeles bondsman.\n\nLos Angeles Bail Bonds is the place, which has been dealing in providing indemnification for those detained for the past many years with great success. Their address is listed as 700 S. Flower St., Suite 1130, Los Angeles, CA 90017 and they can be accessed through telephone number 888-224-5266. Now, being caughtcan be successfully solved via Los Angeles Bail Bonds. You can get your loved one being bailed via a simple telephone call on the numbers being provided. The only thing you ought to know is the full name of the person being detained. If there are more people with the same name, you should know the complete date of birth of the person who has been put behind the bars, to complete the bail process via Los Angeles Bail Bonds.\n\nLos Angeles Bail Bonds, Greg Rynerson Bail Bonds\nCall us at 888-224-5266. http://www.888bailbond.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bd1PxF540o", "title": "Los Angeles Bail Bonds", "publishedDate": "2012-01-14T20:21:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bdWc2JKkpo", "description": "OUT NOW at iTunes: http://enhan.co/Paralyzed-iT\nBeatport: http://enhan.co/Paralyzed-BP\nAmazon: http://enhan.co/Paralyzed-AZ\nGoogle Plus: http://enhan.co/Paralyzed-GP\nTrackItDown: http://enhan.co/Paralyzed-TID\n\nLabel: Enhanced Recordings\nCat.

The political reality is that the current administration is doing quite the opposite thing.\n\nLong before he became US president or the winner of a Noble Peace Prize, Barack Obama was a constitutional law professor. During his election campaign he vowed to reverse the abuses and policies of his predecessor George W. Bush.\n\nThree years later, many civil rights advocates, who once cheered \"yes, we can,\" are finding themselves disillusioned.\n\n\"Not only has the Obama administration blocked torture accountability and refused to investigate and prosecute. He has basically maintained indefinite detention. He has revived military commissions. As well he has expanded targeted killings -- they've increased under the Obama administration manifold, and he's even authorized the killing of a US citizen,\" explains Maria LaHood from the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nWorld-renowned author and scholar Noam Chomsky believes the Obama administration has changed gears and accelerated illegal practices into overdrive.\n\n\"There is a shift between Bush's policies and the Obama's on this. Bush's policy was to kidnap people, take them to Guantanamo or Bagram or some other torture chamber and try to extract some information from them. Obama's policy is just to kill them. They're killing them all over the world. And the Bin Laden assassination was a case point,\" he told RT.", "title": "President Obama - Civil Libertarian or Totalitarian Tyrant?

Green tree frogs from Florida are really simple animals to keep, and oftentimes, we will put them in an enclosure with other animals, green anoles, brown anoles, fire-bellied toads. They are small enough to co-habitate with a lot of creatures. \n\nNot every tree frog is such a friendly creature, though, and certainly, one of the most popular in the pet trade today are dumpy tree frogs, or the White's tree frogs. Dumpies get tremendous, as you see by my friend here, who we cleverly named Dumpy 12 years ago. \n\nThey will eat just about anything that comes into their enclosure. They are not friendly to co-habitate with anyone. Those beautiful toe pads keep him secured in the canopy where he likes to be. So, in your enclosure that will be up in the upper recesses of the tank. They need a lot of different hiding spots. \n\nThey are nocturnal by nature, so you'll see them sit all day long. Oftentimes, though, to have fun with my animal, I take him out during the day, put him on the bezel of my monitor in my office and he'll sit there and just hang all day long because he thinks he's hiding from everybody. Really, he's just out in plain sight and there for you to enjoy. At night it wouldn't be so easy to keep him still because at night is when he forages and off he'll go. \n\nHe can jump, that's for sure, but dumpy frogs are very, very slow moving. They almost are couch potatoes and they'll sit there all day long, and that's why they get so chubby so quickly. Oftentimes, a dumpy frog will get so big, some of the males, they get big furrows and folds on their skin and their stomachs can get quite large because, again, of their voracious appetite. \n\nThis is probably the number one pet frog in the business right now, as far as tree frogs go, and one of my favorites because breeders have taken the lead here and these animals are showing up now captive-bred. There's probably nothing better you can do when you buy an animal than get something that was born in captivity, rather than taking out of its native continent or native country. \n\nThe dumpy tree Frog from Australia: definitely a cute frog that's easy to keep, and a big recommendation from me as far as your first pet frog.", "title": "5 Care Tips for Dumpy Tree Frogs | Pet Reptiles", "publishedDate": "2013-08-09T20:06:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bnwvfuhbH8", "description": "Trachycarpus nainital growing in Massachusetts USDA zone 6b.", "title": "Trachycarpus nainital growing in Massachusetts", "publishedDate": "2012-12-06T20:09:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bo2Cb0S2lY", "description": "\u30bf\u30ed\u30a6\u306b\u8ffd\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3001\u6df1\u96ea\u3092\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb\u30eb\u3057\u3066\u9003\u3052\u308b\u30a8\u30be\u30b7\u30ab\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n2012/12/23\u3000\u64ae\u5f71", "title": "\u30a8\u30be\u30b7\u30ab\u3000Yezo Sika-deer", "publishedDate": "2012-12-23T12:34:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bo58CRvXVk", "description": "When choosing a college, its important that you know the differences between public and private universities.

Idem per lo sciroppo d'agave e altri ingredienti dove esistono versioni a crudo e a cotto.\n \nTratto dal sito di CIBO CRUDO- (azienda certificata bio-veg raw food)\n\"Gli anacardi crudi sono molto pi\u00f9 dolci, pi\u00f9 gustosi e nutrienti rispetto agli anacardi cotti. La maggior parte degli anacardi etichettati come \"raw anacardi\" non sono veramente \"raw\". Sono stati lavorati con il calore al fine di rimuovere il \"dado\" delizioso dal guscio tossico. L' elaborazione di anacardi grezzi \u00e8 un lavoro faticoso e da incubo e le persone che lavorano in impianti di trasformazione devono essere esperti e pazienti per poter dare alla fine un ottimo risultato di anacardi crudi. Questo tipo di lavoro manuale \u00e8 anche pi\u00f9 costoso, per questo la maggior parte dei trasformatori tratta gli anacardi con vapore o friggendoli nell'olio. Una recente ricerca dell'Universit\u00e0 di Montreal in Canada in collaborazione con l'Universit\u00e0 La Yaound\u00e8 del Camerun sostiene che avrebbero propriet\u00e0 benefiche nei confronti del diabete di tipo 2. Infatti gli estratti ricavati da semi foglie e corteccia stimolano l'assorbimento del glucosio prevenendo il diabete\"...\nInsomma il loro costo \u00e8 giustificato!\nIn sintesi, se si vuole essere certi del prodotto finito, bisogna solo rivolgersi ad aziende serie!\n\nhttp://www.cibocrudo.com/prod/44225/anacardi%20sgusciati%20bio%20raw%20organic%20250g.htmlhttp://www.cibocrudo.com/prod/44162\n\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n\n\u00ae Cucina BioEvolutiva\n\ntag: raw food vegan snack veg vegetarian recipe spring summer primavera estate ricetta facile video ricette crudiste job work lavoro pausa dieta light dolce dessert pic nic barretta", "title": "Barrette Pic Nic - Raw Snack - Gusto Mela e Cannella - Ricetta Crudista", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T17:42:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "3boxQwSpv-8", "description": "Virginia Department of Health reminds you to wash your hands.", "title": "Hand Washing PSA (English)", "publishedDate": "2007-07-31T17:44:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3bpD1lZsTsM", "description": "\"Arcturus\" is the 9-10th grade trumpet audition solo for the NC Southeastern All-District Band.

At age 13 he moves to Israel with his family. In 1998 he made his first steps in writing music.\n\n In 2004 he is starting to study Sound Engineering at Yoav Gera Sound School, school that grew up generations of well known artists. In 2006 after finishing of sound studies, he tries himself in the sound industry as: Boom Man, Post Production, PA and Junior Soundman. After being close enough to important people in the music industry, he reaches himself their respect and support. The inspiration to Techno music came from underground movements in Tel Aviv city at those days. \n\nIn 2008, together with his friend Alex, they are establishing AK Tek Records, record label for new and promising artists. In 2009 he is releasing his mixed compilation Techno Union, that includes works from top producers such as Lutzenkirchen, Joseph Disco, Daniele Gas side by side with fresh talents. After some success of the label at charts and parties, they decides to enlarge label's horizons. AK Tek Records becomes a division of Alienews Label Group, Germany. Today Konstantin is working mostly with big labels. \n\nAfter such a short way he has already became one of the leading artists in Israel.\n\nEnjoy.\nBuy release: https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/371907/Just%20Can%27t%20Stop", "title": "Project KF - Just Can't Stop (Bonzai Basiks)", "publishedDate": "2011-05-25T09:36:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3br2lKWZ2tc", "description": "COOH [PRSPCT | Genosha 175 | Position Chrome // BG]\nROBYN CHAOS [Freak | Tech Freak | Therapy Sessions // UK]\nFORTITUDE [Therapy Sessions Rec. | Future Sickness // UK]\n\nZubcore vs Splinta [subkutan | static echo // AT]\nSynthakt [Culture Assault | Evil Beats | Black Hoe // AT]\nShiftex vs Nocturia [Acherontic Sound | Therapy Sessions Austria // AT]\n\nVisuals: Hand Mit Auge [META // AT]\n\nStart: 23:00\nDamage: 10 EUR\n\nFluc Wanne\nPraterstern 5\n1020 Wien", "title": "Therapy Sessions Austria feat.

When coloring bakelite, it was found that some of the compounds used could weaken the bakelite slightly. This was not a problem with static items like radio cases, but it was a definite weakness with well-handled items like telephones. There were also problems in accurately controlling the colors, as the final bakelite color varied between batches according to the exact heat, amount of pigment, and period under pressure. In the U.S., black was the most stable, so black it was until after World War II.  Chemist Leo Hendrik Baekelund, a Belgian-born American living in New York state  found that mixtures of phenol and formaldehyde formed a sticky mass when mixed together and heated, and the mass became extremely hard if allowed to cool and dry.  He continued his investigations and found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create \"composite\" materials with different properties.  Most of these compositions were strong and fire-resistant.  He publicly announced his discovery in 1909, naming it \"bakelite.\"  It was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, finally coming into widespread use in consumer goods in the 1920s.  Phenolic plastics are still in widespread use.  For example, electronic circuit boards are made of sheets of paper or cloth impregnated with phenolic resin.

Her students had been written off, and her chances of succeeding scoffed at, but Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) wasn't about to go down without a fight. Long Beach is a place where a new war is waged with each passing day, and when the hardened students who walk those dangerous hallways sense an outsider attempting to understand their plight, their cynical resentment threatens to keep a deadly cycle in motion. Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble. When the only chance for survival is to befriend the person who was once your mortal enemy, the world is opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.\n\n\"freedom writers\",\"freedom writers clip\",\"freedom writers part 1\",\"freedom writers trailer\",\"jason finn\",\"vanetta smith\",\"liisa cohen\",\"brian bennett\",\"blake hightower\",\"richard lagravenese\",\"belt videos\",\"diary videos\",\"gun videos\",drama,\"inspirational stories\",\"stacey sher\",\"danny devito\",\"michael shamberg\",\"nan morales\",\"daniel s levine\",\"hilary swank\",\"jordana glick-franzheim\",\"tracey durning\",\"caring videos\",\"fear videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++326847,/m/0mz73,/m/0bjc5py", "title": "Freedom Writers (3/9) Movie CLIP - When Will I Be Free?

There's a variety of different tree frogs we can talk about today, but two I'm going to introduce you two. Number one is the Australian dumpy frog. Technical name is the White's tree frog, after the gentleman who discovered them many years ago in Australia, some scientist named White. But in the pet trade they've turned into the dumpy frog, which are very, very popular pets. \n\nAgain, as you can see, an arboreal frog. It's got little toe pads. Almost looks like E.T. hanging out there on the limb. And they are fantastic creatures in that they are predators. People think frogs sometimes are really neat creatures that are friendly. They play the guitar and they date Miss Piggy. But if you really know something about frogs, you'll know that frogs are indeed predators.\n\nThis little dumpy frog here loves his insects. He dives off the plants to go grabbing anything he has with his suction cup hands. He grabs things and he shoves them in his mouth. And we've seen large dumpy frogs, and they do get quite big, we've seen large dumpy frogs eat things as big as mice. \n\nIn their native Australia they sometimes inhabit the linings of caves and eat small brown bats as they go flying by. You wouldn't think a creature that big could do it, but after a couple of years they get a little larger than that. And they certainly have a voracious appetite. So, a dumpy tree frog is not exactly as friendly as he looks. He's got a nasty temperament when it comes to meal time. \n\nHis complement, if we move down here, is a small little frog, nowhere as big as that, but this is the common green frog that you'll see in Florida. Has very similar habits to the dumpy frog, half a world away. Hangs out in the trees, a voracious predator, again, anything that comes near him. But his diet is pretty much limited to insects because of his size. If I put the dumpy frog too close to the green frog, we might see a big mistake, in that the green frog would be his meal very, very quickly. As a matter of fact, I think he's eying him right now. \n\nThe dumpy tree frog from Australia gets his name, of course, his nickname, of dumpy, because as they get older they start to get a little on the chubby side. You'll see them actually get folds on their eyelids, folds of skin that almost looks like a Shar Pei puppy, and that's why they get that name dumpy. \n\nWe think about Australia, you think about desert and outback, but the northeast part of the country is heavily forested, and that's where you'll find these animals: hiding all day from predators. Their predator friends are snakes for the most part that look for them all day long. So, the dumpy will just hide in a tree canopy and wait for night to come. That's his time to go forage for food.

Not only do anxiety and depression cause insomnia, but insomnia can also lead to anxiety and depression. So an extensive history by your physician is needed to determine what can what came first.\n \nNow, in terms of medical problems, insomnia can lower your pain threshold, so pain syndromes such as arthritis, do become worse. It can also cause weight gain because you are sleep deprived, essentially. It causes an imbalance of hormones to control your appetite, which are leptin and ghrelin. Ghrelin is a hormone that helps you feel hungry. Leptin is a hormone that helps you feel satisfied after meals. So you're more hungry and less satisfied after meals, so you tend to eat more. It can also alter your metabolism, so it is harder to lose weight if you do have insomnia.\n\nIt can also lead to heart disease and cause a reduction in immune responses to illnesses and frequent colds.
