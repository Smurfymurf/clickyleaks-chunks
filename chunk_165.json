When the machine creates and the creativity is machine. Or also as an alternative subtitle \"the artist in the age of its partial substitutability\". From \"Modern Times\" of Chaplin to the things that us humans cannot even imagine, as those viewed by Roy of \"Blade Runner\"; from the production line, the Taylorism&Fordism, to the literary and video cyberpunk, a whole century has witnessed the increasingly massive intervention of the device, of serial automatism on humans wills and thoughts. In parallel to the advent of electrical addiction and mechanical dependency, our evolution - or only maybe our going forward - has been characterized by the consenting imposition of the machine in our life styles; our existential habits that do not know how to be single, force us to look for noncorresponded company in hi-tech apparatuses that satisfy each necessity and that one can bring everywhere. Turning above and beyond the now very recognized web and fileart, digital photography and vectorial image, the video art and the new experimental methodologies, the increasing adoption of scientific and programmed elements is evident in the Artist of the new era. The unconscious creative, which above all is a human unconscious, is so aware of the constant inescapable consequences established by the electroauthority mistress (which in turn is in perfect harmony with the fast and furious passing of the days we live in), that it makes an increasingly recurrent and constituent presence of doing art. Thus, promoting it from a past role where the subject is taken into examination for a figurative-conceptual process inside the work, to a different role of irreplaceable creative hand with which to engage in dialog and to confront themselves to constantly produce it together, the work. Battaglini takes this relationship to the limit using a software pattern maker, which after processing a fragment of an image selected by the artist, divides it, alters it, reproduces it and re-assembles it, ending up with a totally random composition that flees the approach of cause, purpose and predictability. The results (unlike the patterns of geometric and symmetric reproduction that assume a predictable shape) do not follow any describable deterministic model. Goodbye, artist? It is a provocation to the role of the machine in the artistic production; It is about the boundaries between human creativity and informatics creativity. It is an investigation of the edge where something perceived as visually organic, turns into something visually synthetic. It is the dichotomy of contemporary men, struggling between their original naturalness and an ever more artificial future.", "title": "goodbye artist?", "publishedDate": "2009-03-07T15:59:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9OwgYFWwQlU", "description": "I don't usually do these tribute things, but Jason Becker is one of my favorite guitarists of all-time.

This was followed by two sittings, in May and June 2012, at the artist's studio in the West Country, England, and Kensington Palace. Emsley later made use of a series of photographs produced during the sittings. His subjects are frequently located against a dark background and emphasise 'the singularity and silence of the form'; while utilising a meticulous technique of thin layers of oil paint and glazes.\n \nPaul Emsley says: 'The Duchess explained that she would like to be portrayed naturally - her natural self - as opposed to her official self. She struck me as enormously open and generous and a very warm person. After initially feeling it was going to be an unsmiling portrait I think it was the right choice in the end to have her smiling - that is really who she is.'\n \nFollowing three-and-a-half months of painting, the completed portrait was presented to the Gallery's Trustees at their November 2012 meeting. \n\nhttp://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org", "title": "The first portrait of The Duchess of Cambridge is unveiled", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T17:47:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "9P4bsi16R7s", "description": "Deixa't seduir per les espectaculars veus dels In Crescendo, que ens ofereixen una emocionant versi\u00f3 de \"Fields of Gold\" a cappella.

(hyperlink)\n \nWork began in March 2014 to add c.6000 seats to the South Stand and both projects are due to complete in time for the start of the 2015/16 Barclays Premier League season.   \n \nDemand has soared from fans hoping to secure a seat following the news of the South Stand expansion, and the waiting list for new seasoncards now stands at 7,500.\n \nPlanning permission has also been granted for a third phase which could see a further c.6000 seats and a total capacity of c.61000, making the Etihad the second largest stadium in the Premier League.\n \nTom Glick, Chief Commercial Officer, said: \"We have always been committed to bringing fans closer to Manchester City, to the players and to the pitch. Whether that's through digital innovation, community work, international tours, or as in this case, physically allowing fans to be right next to the action, it is our top priority. We are already looking forward to seeing the expanded stadium in action for the 15/16 season.\"\n \nFor nine months of 2013 Manchester City held a free exhibition on the Etihad Campus in order to consult with local residents, fans and other stakeholders. The decision to increase the capacity of the Etihad Stadium has enabled the Club to provide even more \u00a3299 seasoncards and at the same time to improve the on-site hospitality offering.\n \nAs with all of the Club's infrastructure projects, the expansion provides both employment and procurement opportunities for the local community.  Approximately 160 people will be employed through the project at its peak and up to 110 match day jobs will be created in these first phases.\n \nThe work begins with immediate effect and will continue throughout the 2014/15 season.

The links listed are generally for bulk jewelry materials, as unfortunately you can't buy individuals online as easily online. Just go to your bead / craft store for individuals :)\n\n1. Chain - as long as you need to fit it around your neck. Think about whether you want a choker type necklace or a drop down necklace etc. The chain I bought was $3 per metre. http://etsy.me/1i7tWDb\n\n2. Wire - 0.5 - 0.6mm of jewelry wire to wrap around your pendant / stone. The jewelry wire I bought was $3 per 10m. http://etsy.me/1cSgKTI\n\n3. JUMP RINGS! - I even got the name wrong in the video. These are like $2 for 100, and 10c on their own. You may not even need these for your necklace after watching the tutorial. http://etsy.me/1cUkb6F\n\n4. Lobster Claw to connect your necklace at the back. http://etsy.me/1fvTrOL\n\n5. Pliers for cutting your wire and chain.\n\n6. Stone! (I'd suggest buying these in person individually if you're making one necklace, but here are links to a few bulk (some individual) pendant / stone type things.)\n\nThe exact stones that I have - http://etsy.me/1lBpcGv\nA pastelly version of those stones - http://etsy.me/N7MdVg\nThe pendants that are everywhere -  http://etsy.me/1fUqHQF (light pink, look around and you'll find different colours - these you can buy individually)\nNatural Quartz Pendant - http://etsy.me/1fvXNVW\n\nThere are so many more nice stones out there that would look awesome on a necklace, especially on etsy and eBay as well as at your local craft shop.

Laser Eye Surgery changed my life in a positive way by improving my stigmatism and eliminating my need for glasses or contact lenses.\n\nI want to share some of what I learned from getting my lasik procedure done.  Many people don't know that the week before you surgery you can't wear contact lenses.  Other people are unaware that not everyone is a candidate for Lasik.  Depending on the dryness of your eyes and other factors you might not be able to get Lasik.  \n\nSo the first step is to find a doctor and find out if you are an actual candidate for Lasik.  What they will do is dilate your pupils and run some minor tests on your eyes to determine the dryness and thickness of your corneas.  These tests are standard and will help the Doctor arrive to a decision on if you are a Lasik candidate or not.\n\nThe actual day of the procedure you will want someone to drive with you so they can drive you home from the procedure.  The entire process may only take an hour or two with only 20-40 minutes of actual time in surgery.  In my experience I was done with the surgery in about 20 minutes.  You are awake for the surgery and the Doctor will go over the details of your surgery depending on what Lasik option you choose.\n\nRecovery time can vary depending on a host of factors.  Everyone is different but in my particular case it took me about 3-5 days to be fully recovered but I was able to work 24 hours later.  Consult with your Doctor about recovery expectations.\n\nAsk about follow up appointments and if they are included in your procedure costs.  Typically they will have you back in a week and a month after your surgery to test your eyes and make sure everything is good.\n\nLasik Eye Surgery Calgary AB\nLasik Eye Surgery Calgary\nLaser Eye Surgery Calgary AB\nLasik Calgary AB\nLasik Calgary\nLasik surgery Calgary AB\nLasik eye surgery cost Calgary AB\nVision Correction Calgary", "title": "Laser Eye Surgery Calgary | Lasik eye surgery Calgary AB", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T14:37:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Ph2_2cRmRc", "description": "", "title": "\u3010jubeat x REFLEC BEAT\u3011anemone/S-C-U feat.

Each day 3,000 gallons of air, containing all different types of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs move through the lungs. Because of this the body goes to great lengths to protect the lungs, but some germs still manage to get through. Once inside the lungs, certain germs can multiply and trigger an immune system response that damages and inflames delicate lung tissue. This complication is called pneumonia, and it can be very serious.\nEach year about 5.6 million Americans develop pneumonia, and about 60,000 people die from pneumonia. Worldwide, it's the single largest killer of children under age 5.\nAlthough these types of germs in your lungs are the most common cause of pneumonia, you can also develop pneumonia by inhaling food particles, vomit, or other foreign material. Not every death can be prevented, but quick recognition and proper treatment of pneumonia could undoubtedly save many lives.\nAnyone can be at risk for pneumonia or any other infectious diseases, but some are more vulnerable than others. Older people, young children, those with chronic conditions such as diabetes or lung disease, people who smoke, and people with weak immune systems are at highest risk. People in hospitals are prime targets, especially if they are critically ill, are on a ventilator, or confined to a bed for long periods of time. The cases of pneumonia that start in a hospital tend to be more severe and dangerous because the bacteria found in hospitals are often resistant to antibiotics.\nI hope this helps you understand what pneumonia is and who is at risk. If you have any questions at all, talk to a CVS pharmacist. We're here to help.\n\nSource: CVS Caremark Health Resources", "title": "What is pneumonia?", "publishedDate": "2009-12-17T15:48:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9PlKQgwHPJc", "description": "Chronological Bible part 1121\n1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.\n2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.\n3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.\n4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;\n5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;\n6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;\n7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:\n8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)\n9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:\n10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government.

Saturated fat also appears to have other deleterious effects such as increasing the risk of heart disease (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease/) and shortening the lives of breast cancer survivors (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-survival-butterfat-and-chicken/).

It is not known when it was first published - possibly during the 1850s. Confusingly, despite the fact that this song is referred to as a Scottish song, both composers were in fact Englishmen. According to popular history, the \"Mary\" here refers to 'Highland Mary', a Scottish dairymaid who was Robert Burns' sweetheart. She died at the age of 23, one year younger than I am!\n\nLYRICS:\nI have heard the mavis singing\nHis love song to the morn\nI have seen the dew drop clinging\nTo the rose just newly born\nBut a sweeter song has cheered me\nAt the evening's gentle close\nAnd I've seen an eye still brighter\nThan the dew drop on the rose\n'Twas thy voice my gentle Mary\nAnd thine artless, winning smile\nThat made this world an Eden\nBonnie Mary of Argyle.\n\nTho' thy voice may lose its sweetness\nAnd thine eye its brightness too\nTho' thy step may lack its fleetness\nAnd thy hair its sunny hue\nStill to me wilt thou be dearer\nThan all the world shall own\nI have loved thee for thy beauty\nBut not for that alone\nI have sought thy heart, dear Mary\nAnd its goodness was the wile\nThat made thee mine forever\nBonnie Mary of Argyle.", "title": "Mary of Argyle - Scottish traditional (Christy-Lyn)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T10:28:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9PoHZpXWEKE", "description": "un peque\u00f1o regalito de parte del crew para F\u00e9lix el d\u00eda de su cumplea\u00f1os :D", "title": "El cumplea\u00f1os de felix", "publishedDate": "2012-05-30T03:01:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Pou9or0Lik", "description": "Original Dubstep Track\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/alephnaught", "title": "Aleph Naught - Annuit Coeptis", "publishedDate": "2012-12-24T00:57:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "9PpMgoXd-lM", "description": "Description\nThis full featured Metal-Cutting Bandsaw includes large cutting capacity, a swivel head to cut miters from -45 degrees to +60 degrees, variable speed control, hydraulic feed control and built-in coolant system.

A fisherman was killed in the shooting.\n\nChina.com, an official news portal, reported the identity of the slain fisherman as Song Houmu, the 45-year-old captain of the fishing boat Noyoung 50987. According to AFP, Song was shot in the chest, causing fatal bleeding in his lungs. \n\nIllegal fishing by Chinese fishermen is common in South Korean waters. In 2010, two Chinese fishermen were killed after their vessel crashed into a South Korean Coast Guard ship and sank in the Yellow Sea.

Columbia had Dylan and Mercury didn't. They asked me to write ten more, Come back in two weeks, and make an album. So I did and this is it. \n\nMIKE BLOOMFIELD [electric guitar]: Producer Lou Reizner hired Bloomfield to get the Bob Dylan sound. Mike had backed Dylan when he first \"went Electric\" at the 1965 Newport Folk Music Festival and also played on Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited. \n\nPAUL Butterfield [harmonica]: What's a Dylan song without a harmonica? Paul was the best \"harp\" player in Chicago, so he was hired too. Butterfield brought along his band which included guitarist Elvin Bishop, but Bishop didn't end up on the album. \n\nSAM LAY [drums]: Sam, like Bloomfield, was also a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He Backed Dylan at Newport and on Highway 61 Revisited. A member of the Blues Hall of Fame, Sam has backed blues great's Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. \n\nMARK NAFTALIN [organ]: Another Butterfield member, Mark cleverly played the carol Joy To The World during the bridges on my song Aphrodites Child. A European band used my name Aphrodites Child before hitting as Vangelis with Chariots of Fire. \n\nPETER CETERA [electric bass]: Peter was with a band called The Exceptions and they recorded a song from my album, Ask Me If I Care.

The community now also has an Online Druid College called \"Grove of Dana\", and founded local groves in the world. \n\nThe New Order of Druids is not specifically meso-pagan, neo-pagan, or bound to any particular religion. We welcome people from anywhere in the world, seeking spiritual growth or interest in the Celtic Culture or Druid Path, regardless of age, gender, skin color, language or religion. We believe that everyone deserves the chance in life to learn, to grow and to exchange.\nThe New Order of Druids is a non-profit community, mainly operating on the internet through website, and discussion boards, but also through meetings in established local groves. The N.O.D. headquarters is in Belgium, but has people cooperating in many aspects of it (moderating, monitoring, mentoring, guiding, ...) from other parts of the world. The people in our community can be either male or female, young or old. We make no restrictions on that, nor on the location where people live. We have people from Europe, America and Australia, as well as the Middle East and welcome people from all over the world. The intention is, of course, to attract people who show interest in the path we present, and take it serious. You can be Celtic, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist, it does not matter, as long as you are willing to have an open mind.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about us please feel free to look us up on the internet at: www.druidcircle.org", "title": "NOD 10th Anniversary", "publishedDate": "2013-02-01T06:29:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9QWMWzhsiHg", "description": "Get the App from Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Kitchen+Cat\n\u2605 Kitchen Cat \u2605 Allspice Brandy Chicken Recipe.\nA recipe from the KC Main Courses collection.\nFor this recipe you will need:\n\u2730 \u2730 \u2730 \u2730 \u2730 INGREDIENTS \u2730 \u2730 \u2730 \u2730 \u2730\n1/2 c : Calvados\n1/2 ts : Salt\n2 c : Apple Juice\n4 : Chicken Breast Halves\n2 : Onions; Diced\n1/4 ts : Black Pepper; Freshly Ground\n2 tb : Flour\n2 : Apples\n6 tb : Butter\n1/2 ts : Allspice", "title": "Allspice Brandy Chicken - Kitchen Cat", "publishedDate": "2012-10-29T11:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9QWTEgRC4MA", "description": "Produccion By Grupo State www.grupostate.com\nContato: info@grupostate.com", "title": "NUNCA TE CANSES - CUMULUS", "publishedDate": "2013-10-23T21:49:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9QWdBoXvGhk", "description": "Watch a seasoned professional demonstrate how to clean window screens in this free online video about window washing.\n\nExpert: Christopher Lyman\nBio: Christopher Lyman has been running his own window washing business for the past twelve years.\nFilmmaker: joseph wilkins", "title": "How to Wash Windows : Cleaning Window Screens", "publishedDate": "2008-03-20T08:01:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "9QXWUi1KJ3Y", "description": "www.caitlincanty.com\non a rainy / briefly sunny day in June, Brooke Sebold and Owen Donovan shot this video live in a corner window in NYC.

Cuccaro, catturato dopo due anni di latitanza, \u00e8 destinatario di numerose ordinanze di custodia cautelare in carcere ed una condanna definitiva all'ergastolo in qualit\u00e0 di mandante dell'omicidio di Luigia Esposito, rinvenuta cadavere il 14 novembre del 1996 nelle campagne di Sant'Anastasia. Cuccaro, 42 anni, si nascondeva ad Ardea in una villetta monofamiliare.\n \nIl cerchio attorno a lui si \u00e8 chiuso negli ultimi tempi, e sabato pomeriggio, quando gli uomini sul campo hanno avuto la certezza che l'uomo che seguivano da tempo era Cuccaro, sono intervenuti. Al blitz hanno partecipato gli uomini della squadra mobile di Napoli, del Servizio centrale operativo, del Servizio polizia scientifica, della squadra mobile di Roma e del commissariato \"Ponticelli\", diverse decine di uomini in tutto.\n \nCuccaro era a bordo di una Mercedes. Vistosi accerchiato ha cercato di fuggire, speronando le auto degli agenti. Ma non ha potuto fare altro che arrendersi e farsi ammanettare. Non era armato ed era in compagnia della moglie, che era andato a trovarlo.\n \nImmediatamente dopo l'arresto gli investigatori coordinati dai pm Valentini e Fratello della Dda napoletana, hanno perquisito l'abitazione nella quale si nascondeva. Guido Marino, alla guida della questura partenopea da qualche mese non nasconde la sua soddisfazione per l'arresto.\n \n\"\u00c8 l'ennesimo risultato di quella \"macchina da guerra\" che \u00e8 la squadra mobile di Napoli\", ha detto nel corso della conferenza stampa in via Medina. Accanto a lui c'\u00e8 il capo della mobile, Fausto Lamparelli, il dirigente della sezione criminalit\u00e0 organizzata, Vasaturo, e la dirigente del commissariato Ponticelli, Antonella Andria. E a loro che rivolge il suo apprezzamento per il lavoro svolto. \"Non riesco ad essere sorpreso, -- ha aggiunto -- questo arresto \u00e8 il frutto di un lavoro costante e senza soste degli uomini e delle donne della questura\".\n \nCuccaro gestiva con i fratelli Michele e Luigi, entrambi latitanti, gli affari dell'omonimo clan attivo nell'area orientale dei Napoli gi\u00e0 dalla fine degli anni '80. Il gruppo attualmente detiene il monopolio di tutte le attivit\u00e0 illecite del quartiere di Barra e delle aree confinanti inclusa Ponticelli.\n\nLo scorso 8 marzo, a Capodrise, in provincia di Caserta, la polizia ha arrestato un pregiudicato ritenuto un esponente di spicco dello stesso clan: si tratta di Vincenzo Amodio, di 50 anni, condannato a otto anni di reclusione per concorso in estorsione e usura, aggravati dal metodo mafioso nei confronti di titolari di sale di videogiochi e di agenzie di scommesse online, ai quali venivano imposte tangenti. Insieme ad Amodio venne condannato anche Cuccaro.

So, the traditional sense is that a lot of people know it by print design.  Maybe you're designing a brochure or an annual report or a flyer, a club flyer, or maybe you're doing like a website design or mobile application design which was more into interactive design.  But the actual term graphic design just basically means that you understand the fundamentals of like color, color theory, typography, how it all lines up on a grid, following a grid, not following a grid, and being able to visually express what it is that you or your client or whoever is hiring you or whoever you're partnering with, that you're able to express their idea in the best way visually.  So, that's really like the best definition, for now, of graphic design.  It spans so many different areas.  \n\nSo you see it all around you.  Graphic design can be the signs that you see outside of the store.  Also, book cover art. Like that has a lot to do with knowing how to represent the book and how to make it look, how to make it appeal to this target audience.  At the end of the day, you want to make sure that whatever or whoever you're designing for will get the message.  So, if you're designing for seniors, you can't have small print.  It's just being very conscious about the way that you visually express things.  So when you're looking at programs or schools or different jobs, you'll always see that the main thing is understanding and an ability to communicate not only verbally, but visually.", "title": "What Is Graphic Design? | Graphic Design", "publishedDate": "2013-03-22T15:00:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9QxDsC0z6Ws", "description": "Irresistible gently fried sweet potatoes covered in a sugary coat, garnished with black sesame seeds.\n\nFor the complete recipe with step-by-step pictures :: http://justonecookbook.com/blog/recipes/candied-sweet-potatoes/\n\nIngredients: \n\n11 oz.

Today's announcement marks the 100-year anniversary of when the Montana State Legislature first began work with local residents to protect the Front by setting up the Sun River Game Preserve, and less than a week after a new study found outdoor recreation supports 64,000 Montana jobs. \n\nSince Baucus first introduced the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act  in 2011, it has earned endorsements from six Montana newspapers and more than 800 sportsmen, along with wildlife and recreation organizations and state government agencies. See complete list of endorsements HERE. \n\n\"Just like the Sun River Game Preserve 100 years ago, the Heritage Act was put together by local ranchers, sportsmen, and small businesses coming together around the kitchen table to do what makes sense for their community.  This is their bill, I'm just the hired hand moving it through Congress, and I'll continue getting feedback from Montanans and taking my orders from them to make this bill work even better for our state,\" Baucus said. \"We owe it to our kids and grandkids to protect unique treasures like the Front that make Montana the greatest place on earth.  On top of that, protecting the Front is good for business and good for Montana jobs, with more than $10 million spent each year in the Front during hunting season alone.\"\n\nMontana Senator Jon Tester is an original co-sponsor of the bill. \n\nThe Rocky Mountain Heritage Act is the result of a wide variety of Montanans working together since 2007 to develop a cooperative effort to preserve the Front, while protecting grazing opportunities for ranchers and public access for hunters, fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts. Baucus first introduced the bill on behalf of its grassroots supporters in October of 2011 after attending public listening sessions with Montanans.

They are also concerned that the proposed gun control legislation puts too much power in the hands of politicians.\n\n\"I believe that it is our duty to stand together and challenge the proposals currently on the table in the Senate, which invoke painful memories of Jim Crow laws and black codes,\" said CURE president and founder, Star Parker. \"Black history is rife with government demands for background checks in order to qualify for constitutional rights.  All Americans should be concerned.\"\n\nStar Parker, a nationally syndicated columnist and other noted thought leaders, authors and speakers will make the case against the type of gun control measures President Obama and his liberal allies are proposing.  While the group believes that Sandy Hook was a national tragedy, they oppose its use as an opportunity to advance government control and strip any American citizens of their constitutional rights. In the middle of Black History Month, CURE is calling for a serious national dialogue about the impact of gun control on the black community.   \n\n\"We want to inform United States senators that we will be notifying urban pastors, business leaders and other black voters of their legislators' position on the Second Amendment\u2014especially blue senators in red states currently up for re-election.\" The news conference is to rally behind the tradition of former slave and great American orator Frederick Douglass who said, \"A man's rights rest in three boxes: the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.\"\n\nDAFR fights for the inalienable firearms rights of responsible disabled Americans. Disabled Americans have unique needs when exercising their 2nd Amendment rights. The mission of DAFR is intertwined within five basic areas of focus.\n\nThese areas consist of:\n\n1. The introduction of firearms for self-defense to disabled Americans.\n2. Shooting sports program and organized competition for disabled Americans and wounded veterans.\n3. Oversee firearms legislation and research their impact on Americans with disabilities.\n4. Offer assistance to responsible disabled Americans in order to exercise their 2nd Amendment right.\n5. Educating the public and elected officials about how disabled American firearms owners have unique needs that must be met when exercising their 2nd Amendment right.\n\n\nWe have also become concerned with recent legislation that is proposed throughout the United States in reaction to the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. With that, our organization has taken a clear stand on various bills, public acts and proposed laws that we deem would be disadvantageous to responsible disabled firearms owners. DAFR intends to shed light on the fact that many Disabled Americans can only use certain types of firearms such as the highly adaptable AR15 rifle platform. A ban or other serious restrictions on the AR15 rifle as well as certain other firearms will have an adverse effect on the rights of thousands of disabled Americans.\n\nhttp://www.dafr.org\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DAFRUSA\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/DAFRUSA\n\nIf you support Disabled Americans for Firearms Rights, please visit our website at http://www.dafr.org , join our organization and spread the word, THANK YOU ALL for the support!", "title": "[SHORT VERSION] Black conservative leaders discuss how the NRA was created to protect freed slaves", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T05:24:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "9RAYBGJp--8", "description": "\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 Amazon \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0438 \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430.\n\n\u0421\u041f\u0410\u0421\u0418\u0411\u041e \u0417\u0410 \u041f\u041e\u0414\u041f\u0418\u0421\u041a\u0423!\nFIRST CHANNEL http://www.youtube.com/user/FoggyDisaster\nTWITTER http://twitter.com/kate_clapp\nFACEBOOK http://www.facebook.com/kateclapp\nDAILYBOOTH http://dailybooth.com/KateClapp\nVKONTAKTE http://vk.com/kate_clapp\n\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438:\n\nEBAY: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_dGOkSrkrA\nAMAZON: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RAYBGJp--8\nFOREVER21: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taf3bevXPnY\n\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0438 \u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 ShopFans.ru\nhttps://shopfans.ru/\n\u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0443: https://shopfans.ru/guide/overview.html", "title": "AMAZON \u0418\u041d\u0421\u0422\u0420\u0423\u041a\u0426\u0418\u042f / \u041a\u0410\u041a \u0417\u0410\u041a\u0410\u0417\u042b\u0412\u0410\u0422\u042c \u0418 \u0420\u0415\u0413\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0420\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u0422\u042c\u0421\u042f", "publishedDate": "2013-09-26T21:39:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9RAjQbwaGXM", "description": "Burnouts following the funeral of a friend to all of us.

About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, \"Sir, you've got to come in and talk to me a second.\" I said, \"Well, you're too busy.\" He said, \"No, no.\" He says, \"We've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.\" This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, \"We're going to war with Iraq? Why?\" He said, \"I don't know.\" He said, \"I guess they don't know what else to do.\" So I said, \"Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?\" He said, \"No, no.\" He says, \"There's nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.\" He said, \"I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we can take down governments.\" And he said, \"I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.\"\n\nSo I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.

It lies between the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Sea of Okhotsk to the west. Immediately offshore along the Pacific coast of the peninsula runs the 10,500-metre (34,400 ft) deep Kuril-Kamchatka Trench\n\nKamchatka receives up to 2,700 mm (110 in) of precipitation per year. The summers are moderately cool, and the winters tend to be rather stormy with rare amounts of lightning.\n\nThe climate is colder in the north of the peninsula, but is continental, with cool winters and relatively warm summers. The summer months are popular with tourists when maximum temperatures range from 15\u00baC (59F) to 30\u00baC (86F), but a growing trend in winter sports keeps tourism pulsing year-round. The Volcanoes and glaciers play a role in forming of the Kamchatka's climate, and hot springs have also kept alive dozens of species decimated during the last ice age\n\nAlthough the peninsula lies at similar latitudes to Great Britain, the cold arctic winds from Siberia combined with the cold Oya-Shio sea current result in the peninsula being covered in snow from October to late May.\n\nThe Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. The peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena, with 19 active volcanoes being included in the six UNESCO World Heritage List sites in the Volcanoes of Kamchatka group, most of them on the Kamchatka Peninsula\n\nThe highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (4,750 m or 15,584 ft), the largest active volcano in the Northern Hemisphere, while the most striking is Kronotsky, whose perfect cone was said by celebrated volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker to be a prime candidate for the world's most beautiful volcano. Somewhat more accessible are the three volcanoes visible from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky: Koryaksky, Avachinsky, and Kozelsky. In the center of Kamchatka is Eurasia's world famous Geyser Valley which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007\n\nOwing to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, deep-focus seismic events and tsunamis are fairly common. A pair of megathrust earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16, 1737, and on November 4, 1952, in the magnitude of ~9.3 and 8.2 respectively. A chain of more shallow earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006\n\nKamchatka boasts abundant flora. The variable climate promotes different flora zones where tundra and muskeg are dominant succeeded by grasses, flowering shrubs and forests of pine, birch, alder and willow.\n\nThe wide variety of plant forms spread throughout the Peninsula promotes just as wide a variation in animal species that feed off them. Although Kamchatka is mostly tundra, deciduous and coniferous trees are abundant and forests can be found throughout the peninsula.", "title": "Kamchatka: The far side of the world", "publishedDate": "2013-04-02T14:35:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9RP-QYwK60c", "description": "When we're stuck in a meeting, we usually text a savior to call us out of the room.

It completely restores hair, but give it at least 1-2 weeks to work its magic long-term. The fact that its 100% natural, great smell and lasts a long time is just a huge bonus. I've been using this as my intensive hair mask for over 2 months now. Once your hair is healthy you only need to use it maybe once a week, otherwise the protein will be too drying.

This dance form was not so popular till our Bollywood evergreen beauties followed the mujra footsteps sparkled their magic on the floor.\n\nMujra is a form of dance originated by tawaif (courtesans) during the Mughal era which incorporated elements of the native classical Kathak dance onto music such as thumris and ghazals or poems of those from other Mughal cultures such as Bahadur Shah Zafar.\nMujra was traditionally performed at mehfils and in special houses called kothas. During Mughal rule in the subcontinent, in places such as Jaipur, the tradition of performing mujra was a family art and often passed down from mother to daughter amongst Muslim practitioners. The profession was a cross between art and exotic dance, with the performers often serving as courtesans amongst Mughal royalty or wealthy patrons.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny), mujra performances provided an opportunity for mutineers to meet and many tawaif were also actively involved in the movement. As a result, many kothas were confiscated by the British after the mutiny, disrupting the traditional tawaif succession. By the early 1900s, many tawaif had moved into the prostitution industry as the traditional system had broken down. Some tawaif moved to the film and music industry.\n\nModern mujra dancers perform at events like weddings, birthday events and bachelor parties in countries where traditional Mughal culture is prevalent, such as Pakistan and India,( lesser extent in Bangladesh) often performing a modern form of mujra along with popular local music. Mujra has been depicted in Bollywood films like Umrao Jaan and Devdas or other films that show the past Mughal rule and its culture. The women trained in mujras often end up in prostitution.There is a famous location in India, in the city of Agra where it is a tradition for every man to learn mujra. In 2005, when dance bars were closed across Maharashtra state, many former bar girls moved to Congress House near Kennedy Bridge on Grant Road area in Mumbai, city oldest hub for mujra, and started performing mujra", "title": "Saima Khan  , Latest Pakistani  Mujra Hot , 355  \u2588\u25ac\u2588 \u2588 \u2580\u2588\u2580  2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-13T12:47:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9RYW-vHxtLI", "description": "\u300c\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u8349\u85e5\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u65c5\u300d\u690d\u7269\u5c0e\u8cde\u5f71\u7247\n\u82e7\u9ebb Boehmeria nivea (Linn.)Gaudich.", "title": "\u300c\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u8349\u85e5\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u65c5\u300d\u690d\u7269\u5c0e\u8cde\u5f71\u7247 - \u82e7\u9ebb Boehmeria nivea (Linn.)

Nestled between the Kunlun Mountain ranges and the Himalayas, Ladakh boasts of innumerable vistas ranging from lakes to mountains and valleys. Located in the northernmost part of India, the region is a dream travel destination for people from all over the world.\n\nLadakh has a great diversity of birds, both resident and migratory birds. Some 225 different species of birds have been recorded in Ladakh. In the mountains one can see Chukor Partridge, Kestrel, Lammergeier, Himalayan griffin vultures and also the occasional golden eagle. Of the migratory birds the black-necked is one of the rarest species found in the Changthang Lakes. Other birds include the Bar --headed Goose, Tibetan Snowcock , Brahminy Duck etc....\n\nLadakh a word which means \"land of high passes\", is a region in the state of Jammu and Kashmir of Northern India sandwiched between the Karakoram mountain range to the north and the Himalayas to the south. The Indian portion of Ladakh is composed of the Leh and Kargil districts. The Leh district is the largest district of India, covering more than half the area of Jammu and Kashmir, of which it is the eastern part.\nAdventure tourism in Ladakh started in the 19th century. By the turn of the 20th century, it was not uncommon for British officials to undertake the 14 stage trek from Srinagar to Leh as part of their annual leave. Agencies were set up in Srinagar and Shimla to specialise sport related activities \u2014 hunting, fishing and trekking. A large retinue of porters would carry huge canvas tents and collapsible string beds. This era is recorded in Arthur Neves The Tourist's Guide to Kashmir, Ladakh and Skardo, first published in 1911. Today, about 18,000 tourists visit Ladakh every year. Bounded by two mighty mountain ranges, it is a popular place for adventure tourism. The well-preserved Tibetan-Buddhist culture makes it even more attractive.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\nSource: www.dreamladakh.com/birds-ladakh.htm\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

A member of the family Accipitridae, this Old World vulture is not related to the New World vultures which are in a separate family Cathartidae. It is therefore also unrelated to the American Black Vulture despite the similar name and coloration.\n\nIts home range are the semi-deserts, steppes and upland grasslands from southern Europe to China and northeastern Africa. It has all dark plumage, and even at a distance can be distinguished from Griffon Vulture by its evenly broad \"barn door\" wings. It has the typical vulture \"bald\" head, and dark markings around the eye give it a menacing skull like appearance. Among the vultures in its range, the Eurasian Black Vulture is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins, ably using its powerful bill. It dominates all other vultures at carcasses.\n\nIt is the largest bird of prey (Falconiformes) in the world. This huge bird is 110-120 cm (43-48 inches) long with a 250-300 cm (8-10 foot) wingspan and a body mass of up to 14 kg (31 lbs.) thus making it one of the world's heaviest flying birds.\n\n**\nThe Bronx Zoo, located within the Bronx Park, is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States, comprising 265 acres of parklands and naturalistic habitats and home to over 4,000 animals.

Even if there is a gun in my hands and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him.\"\n\"This is the philosophy of non-violence that I have learnt from Gandhiji, Badshah Khan and Mother Teresa,\" the 16-year-old said.\nMalala told the UN that she would not be silenced by terrorist threats.\n\"Let us pick up our books and our pens. They are our most powerful weapons. One teacher, one book, one pen, can change the world,\" Malala said.\nThe UN celebrated the Pakistani schoolgirl's 16th birthday on Friday as Malala Day with day-long programmes for youth, drawn from all over the world.\nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon named her 16th birthday, 'Malala Day', in honour of her heroic stand to ensure education for all.\n\nBan welcomed Malala to the UN praising her courage and determination.\n\"Malala chose to mark her 16th birthday with the world,\" Ban said, noting the strong support she has received from millions of people all over the world.\n\"Malala, you are not alone. We are all with you, standing behind you,\" the UN Secretary General said.\nThe meeting, which featured nearly 1,000 youth leaders, was addressed by former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in his capacity as UN Special Envoy for Global Education, Vuk Jeremic, President of the General Assembly, and Ahmad Alhendawi, the Special Envoy on Youth.\nMalala became a global icon for girls' education after being brutally attacked by Taliban \n\"The extremists were, and they are, afraid of books and pens,\" Malala said.\n\"The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women,\" she said.\nMalala called for worldwide action against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism.\n\"We call upon all governments to ensure free compulsory education for every child all over the world,\" she said, also calling on governments to fight against terrorism and violence, to protect children from brutality and harm.\nBan reiterated the UN's commitment to give access to quality education to every girl and boy through its Global Education First Initiative which has three priorities: to put every child in school; improve the quality of learning; and foster global citizenship.\n\"No child should have to die for going to school. Nowhere should teachers fear to teach or children fear to learn.\nTogether, we can change the picture,\" he said.\nBan also encouraged the students gathered at the Youth Assembly, to continue to voice their concerns on issues that matter to them.\n\"I urge you to keep speaking out. Keep raising the pressure. Keep making a difference,\" Ban said.\"You are sending a message, a message of hope and empowerment... a message of dignity and opportunity. All of you are on the front lines,\" he said.\navoid further disparities in education levels.\nHe also stressed that the quality of education should be improved, providing young people with the necessary skills to succeed in the current world economy.\n\"School enrollment is nothing more than a necessary foundation upon which to build a 21st-century set of educational standards,\" Jeremic said.\n\"Basic literacy should not be seen as an end in itself, but merely as a baseline tool for teaching cognition, mathematics, problem-solving, and creative thinking,\" he said.\n Opening the proceedings, Brown told the Youth Assembly: \"You cannot say there is anything other than an education emergency that we need to solve.\"\nWith that in mind, he hailed young people as \"the new superpower in the world\" with the capability to overcome all obstacles to access education.\nOn June 17, Brown launched a worldwide petition calling for urgent action to ensure the right of every child to safely to attend school.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Simple But Attractive Durga Deity", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T06:21:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Rvo8ggGrX8", "description": "Link alla Pagina Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Sintesi-Partite-Serie-A-e-Champions-League-Tutto-in-HD/195372110559326\n\nRoma-Verona 3-0, Maicon, Pjanic e Ljajic nella ripresa\n\nMilano, 01 settembre 2013\n\nCon la Curva Sud chiusa, i giallorossi si divertono: tre gol nei primi 21' della ripresa, dopo un buon primo tempo dei giallobl\u00f9 (che nel finale centrano la traversa con Halfredsson)\nIl tiro cross di Maicon, deviato in porta da Cacciatore: \u00e8 l'1-0.

Afp\nLa Roma costruisce, inventa, spesso si piace anche troppo, ma alla fine porta a casa la seconda vittoria consecutiva della gestione Garcia e va alla sosta a punteggio pieno. I giallorossi dominano come possesso palla, ma devono aspettare quasi 60' prima di sbloccare la partita, grazie ad una giocata Totti-Maicon che scaccia l'incubo di una partita. Poi una magia di Pjanic ed un destro da fuori di Ljajic mettono fine ad ogni velleit\u00e0 giallobl\u00f9, anche se a dire il vero se ne sono viste ben poche.\n\nroma-verona senza curva\n\nfotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery fotogallery\n                 \nMANCA IL GOL \u2014 Senza l'appoggio della Sud (chiusa per i buu razzisti a Balotelli), Garcia si riaffida a De Rossi in regia e lancia Strootman (all'esordio) e Gervinho dal primo minuto. Mandorlini risponde con Martinho e Jankovic a dare equilibrio (tra 4-3-3 e 4-5-1, in fase difensiva) ed Hallfredsson a rinforzare la cerniera di centrocampo. A fare la partita, per\u00f2, \u00e8 solo la Roma, che dopo 3' pu\u00f2 essere gi\u00e0 avanti, ma Florenzi (pescato in verticale da De Rossi) si divora il vantaggio a porta spalancata. Tre minuti dopo \u00e8 un spunto di Gervinho a mettere paura a Rafael, che poi si distingue dalla distanza prima su Pjanic e poi su De Rossi. Davanti Totti, Gervinho e Florenzi si cambiano spesso di posizione, il capitano ci prova al 27' su punizione (Rafael ancora ok), un minuto dopo la prima replica veneta, ma il colpo di testa di Toni \u00e8 out. Poi Strootman ha un altro pallone d'oro, ma non riesce a chiudere il tap-in a ridosso di Rafael.\n\nSHOW GIALLOROSSO \u2014 La ripresa riparte con lo stesso copione, ma il Verona si compatta ancora bene e la Roma senza un centravanti vero, non riesce a trovare profondit\u00e0. Cos\u00ec all'11' pesca il jolly Maicon: Totti trova nel corridoio la percussione del brasiliano, sul cui traversone c'\u00e8 la deviazione decisiva di Cacciatore. Due minuti e arriva la gemma di Pjanic, con una palombella morbida da 20 metri che si insacca sotto il sette alla destra di Rafalel. Per i giallorossi cambia gara, tanto che prima Gervinho poi Balzaretti sfiorano il 3-0. Gol che puntualmente arriva al 21', con Ljajic (anche lui all'esordio) che punta la porta e da 20 metri brucia Rafael di destro. Al 29', poi, Totti inventa ancora per Gervinho, che si divora il 4-0. Al 32' il primo tiro nello specchio della porta del Verona, con Hallfredsson che da 20 metri centra in pieno la traversa, poi (37') Rafael salva su Strootman, che un minuto dopo salva sulla linea su tiro di Cacia.

Molen, Walter F. Parkes, Ronald Shusett\nScreenwriter: Philip K. Dick, Scott Frank\nFilm Description: Based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, this science fiction-thriller reflects the writer's familiar preoccupation with themes of concealed identity and mind control. Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a Washington, D.C. detective in the year 2054. Anderton works for \"Precrime,\" a special unit of the police department that arrests murderers before they have committed the actual crime. Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who hired a team of futurists to devise the film's numerous technologically advanced gadgets, Minority Report co-stars Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Neal McDonough.\n\n\"minority report\",\"minority report clip\",\"minority report part 1\",\"minority report full movie\",\"tom cruise\",\"neal mcdonough\",\"steven spielberg\",\"saxophone videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"walter f parkes\",\"gerald r molen\",\"michael doven\",\"jan de bont\",\"ronald shusett\",\"gary goldman\",\"determination videos\",\"alley videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262610,/m/07r1h,/m/03w4sh", "title": "Minority Report (2/9) Movie CLIP - Anderton Runs (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T23:36:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "9S4GCbYXKwU", "description": "How do Greybeards become Greybeards?

Isn't that interesting..\n\nDIP TO BLACK (to signify later in the meeting).\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANDO IANNICCA (Acting Mayor):\n\nAnd if you don't mind, as Chair, I would like to speak if someone would so move.\n\n[Someone does]\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANDO IANNICCA (Acting Mayor):\n\nThank you, I\u2014\n\nMISSISSAUGAWATCH into camera:\n\nHere he goes.\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANDO IANNICCA (Acting Mayor):\n\n\u2014have an obligation to my consitituents and I'll be very very brief but I think Councillor Carmen (Corbasson) hit on the fundamental point that we're all grappling with. This is not a fun day for us. This is a heart-wrenching decision.\n\nThe reason that I was one of the proponents of the Inquiry \u2014the reason I stand by it emphatically needs all of ten seconds to explain.\n\nNumber One, I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know where this is going.\n\nI do know that minutes have been altered \u2014there some other things have gone on that I cannot explain to my taxpayers and I owe them an explanation.\n\nPoint Number Two, the Lady of Justice is blind for a reason. It matters not who she judges over  \u2014whether that's your Mayor, whether that's my brother, whether that's the local parish priest. And I have to hold that close to my thoughts as well.\n\nI also have a concern to be brutally candid with you of my understanding of some of the conduct that has been outlined \u2014because, to be brutally candid with you,  I would have grave concerns if I lived in a city where a Mayor and all members of Council conducted their affairs in a somewhat similar manner.\n\nIt is not a city that I would want to live in. I've never conducted my affairs in that manner.\n\nI'm shocked that anyone in the audience or anyone in this city would put the cost of such an exercise ahead of having to ensure you have Integrity and Accountability in your political system.\n\n[Jeers and protests from the audience] \n\nCOUNCILLOR NANDO IANNICCA (Acting Mayor):\n\nI beg your pardon.\n\nAnd so to conclude, at the end of the day, I was not elected for my love of the Mayor. I was elected to do the right thing.\n\nThis, as difficult as it is on an emotional level \u2014I want you to hear from me directly, from many of you that I've known for a long time, on an ethical, moral, and the-right-thing level, this is one of the easiest decisions that I've ever had to make though I've never regretted a decision more.\n\nWith that I now turn to the motions before me, I need the assistance of the Clerk to make sure...

Material they don't digest is wrapped in mucus and expelled. This \"pseudofeces\" is rich in nutrients like phosphorus.\n\nEach tiny mussel filters a quart of water each day.  That vigorous activity, abetted by circulating water, has effectively filtered the entire volume of water in Lake Michigan and other Great Lakes. \n\nIn the Great Lakes, invasive quagga and zebra mussels deposit their waste in the relatively narrow bottom areas near shore, where the mussels live. This has caused two profound changes to the lakes: It has dramatically cleared the water, and it has concentrated nutrients like phosphorus near shore. As a result, phosphorus concentrations have decreased off-shore and increased near shore, and sunlight penetrates deeper into the water.\n\nAmong the many consequences to the lake's food web are a major shift of energy sources (phytoplankton) away from open waters, where they would ultimately support trout, salmon, and whitefish, and an increase in nutrients like phosphorus available to algae growing near shore.", "title": "Quagga Mussels Feeding--Speeded Up 10x", "publishedDate": "2009-06-11T17:12:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SKdlVR3uBU", "description": "This patient had two previous rhinoplasty surgeries by another doctor - one was 25 years ago, the second one was 10 years ago, which resulted in a concave scooped-out nose, commonly known as a \"Saddle Nose or a Ski Slope Nose.\" Non-Surgical Revision Rhinoplasty was performed in 15 minutes to provide our patient with an aesthetically appealing nose, that is symmetrical with the rest of her facial features. \n\nNon-surgical rhinoplasty, or a non-surgical nose job, is a non-invasive alternative to surgical rhinoplasty.

Temporary fillers are strategically placed to help camouflage bumps,  create a better bridge in a flat, narrow, or scooped nose, refine the tip, correct imperfections and provide symmetry- which can make the nose appear smaller and more attractive.\n\nTo learn more about non-surgical revision rhinoplasty, please visit https://drkassir.com/procedures/nose-job/ or call us at our New Jersey office at 973.692.9300 or our New York City office at 212.288.3000", "title": "Revision Rhinoplasty by patient with 2 previous nose jobs", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T16:54:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SKjuayJgHg", "description": "jjajaja es  muy facil", "title": "como hacer slime sin borax", "publishedDate": "2014-08-21T19:22:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SKnJ2RCZ-g", "description": "Cool eh", "title": "Portal animations opening", "publishedDate": "2011-01-08T23:32:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SKxbNiSV-k", "description": "http://www.musicmax.eu/\n\nMusicMax is an exclusive distributor of Crafter guitars.\n\nDemonstration of sound - acoustic guitar Crafter TMC 035/N \n\nTemple of the King - Rainbow\n\nTop: Solid Engelmann Spruce\nBack&Sides: Indian Rosewood\nNeck: Mahogany\nFingerboard: Indian Rosewood\n\nCrafter guitars at Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CrafterGuitars?ref=ts&fref=ts", "title": "Temple of the King - Rainbow, Crafter TMC 035/N", "publishedDate": "2013-02-25T11:08:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SL9jekgD00", "description": "The critically endangered Houston Toad is clinging to existence having endured a long drought followed by a fire in 2011 that destroyed much of its habitat around Bastrop Texas.

There are many, many mites which live in the soil, collectively called \"soil mites,\" but this page focuses on mites in the Oribatidae Family. There are more Oribatid Mites than any other soil mites.\n\nOribatid Mites are tiny. They only grow up to a millimeter long. Their color can vary, but they all have a hard exoskeleton (shell).\n\nLike all mites, these animals are close relatives of ticks and spiders.\nOribatid Mites live in the top layer of the soil, leaf litter, or other debris (stuff laying on top of the soil). They can also be found on mosses, lichens, and other low plants.\n\nThese mites live in huge numbers. Hundreds of thousands of mites can live in one square meter of soil. To see one well, you would need a microscope.\n\nOribatid Mites do not need to mate to make more mites. Females can lay eggs on their own.\n\nOribatid Mites eat fungi, algae, and dead plant matter. They also eat dead springtails (tiny insects that live in the soil) and live nematodes (tiny worms).\n\nThese mites are extremely important. They break down old material, such as dead leaves, and put the nutrients back into the soil. This allows living plants to pull the nutrients back into their roots so they can grow and feed animals.\n\nWithout Oribatid Mites and other soil mites to \"recycle\" old material on the ground, plants and animals could not survive. That includes us!\n \n\nSoil mites are also a food source for soil predators, including: small salamanders, beetles, ants, centipedes, larger mites, spiders, and others.\n\nEven though they are tiny, soil mites can also be hosts for parasites, such as tapeworms.\n\nOribatid Mites are born from eggs as nymphs. Nymphs are a smaller, slightly different-looking version of adults. As nymphs eat and grow, they molt (shed their skins). Each time they molt, the nymphs look more like an adult mite.\n\nOribatid Mites cannot burrow through the soil. They rely on larger animals to make tunnels so they can move around.\n\nAs mentioned above, Oribatid Mites and other soil mites are extremely important as decomposers. They break down old dead stuff and turn it into soil with lots of nutrients. All living things benefit from the job they do. The presence of lots of mites is a sign of healthy soil. Scientists can study the mites they find in the soil to learn how clean and healthy it is.\n\nMost of the time, people walk upon the soil and don't even know there are millions of mites under their feet!\n\nMites of the suborder Oribatida (=Cryptostigmata), also called \"beetle\" or \"moss\" mites, are the world's most numerous arthropods living in soil. Their density in forest soil can reach hundreds of thousands of individuals per square meter. There are several thousand described species, yet the fauna of much of the tropics is still unknown. Adult oribatid mites usually have strong exoskeleton, hardened by sclerotization, as in other mites, and by mineralization, similar to millipedes and isopodes. These slow moving mites are 0.2 - 1.0 mm in length and occur in the top layer of soil, in litter debris, sometimes also on plants, mosses and lichens. In contrast to many other microarthropods, oribatid mites reproduce slowly. In cold climates, their life cycle can stretch up to seven years (usually one-two years). Females lay few eggs. Many species are obligately parthenogenetic, with no males recorded. With their slow metabolic rate, slow development and low fecundity, Oribatida are not capable of fast population growth and are usually restricted to relatively stable environments, in contrast to more opportunistic groups such as collembolans. Oribatid mites graze on fungi and algae, consume decomposing plant matter and occasionally dead collembolans. Some oribatids feed on live nematodes. For many groups feeding habits are still unknown. Adult oribatid mites experience relatively little predation due to their strong exoskeleton, though they are subject to predation by ants, certain beetles and small salamanders. The soft-bodied nymphs are attacked by many soil predators. Oribatida comprise an important component of soil decomposers; their abundance, species composition and diversity in a particular habitat serve as good indicators of soil \"health\".", "title": "adult  oribatid mite Collohmannia sp.", "publishedDate": "2011-02-25T15:01:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SLUj_s0MrA", "description": "Un couple au Texas Bradley et Tammi Bleimeyer ont s\u00e9questr\u00e9, meurtri , et mal nourris leurs fils de 5 ans qui vivait dans un placard minuscule sous un escalier avec rien qu'un matelas \u00e0 l'Int\u00e9rieur.\n\nLe petit gar\u00e7on a \u00e9t\u00e9 sauv\u00e9 la semaine derni\u00e8re lorsque des bruits se sont faits entendre provenant de la maison et la police a \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9 pour tapage nocturne.\n\nLe demi-fr\u00e8re du gar\u00e7on \u00e2g\u00e9 de 16 ans a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la police que son petit fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait enferm\u00e9 dans un placard .\n\nL'adolescent et son p\u00e8re Bradley Bleimeyer , 24 ans ont eu une altercation la m\u00e8re entre temps a tent\u00e9 de s'\u00e9chapper avec le petit afin de le dissimuler.\n\nLes policiers sont entr\u00e9s dans la maison et ont d\u00e9couvert le placard sous l'escalier , avec un matelas \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et un verrou fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte .\n\nTammi Bleimeyer , 33 ans, la belle-m\u00e8re de l'enfant , avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fui la maison avec l'enfant au moment o\u00f9 les autorit\u00e9s sont arriv\u00e9es .\n\nLe p\u00e8re et la belle-m\u00e8re de l'enfant ont refus\u00e9 de divulguer quoi que se soit \u00e0 la police .\n\nLes agents ont suivi le p\u00e8re qui s'est rendu dans un motel \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 , vendredi ils ont rep\u00e9r\u00e9 Bradley Bleimeyer sortir d'une des chambres. \n\nIls sont all\u00e9s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, et ont trouv\u00e9 Tami Bleimeyer et le gar\u00e7on .\n\nL'enfant a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital tandis que les deux parents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9s et inculp\u00e9s de mise en danger de l'enfant .\n\n\" Le gar\u00e7on , qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 portant juste une couche-culotte , il \u00e9tait gravement sous-aliment\u00e9s , ses os \u00e9taient apparents et ressortaient, il avait aussi des bosses  et des ecchymoses . \n\nSa peau se d\u00e9tachait de son dos \u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'agent Mark Herman .\n\nTammi Bleimeyer , qui est enceinte et a d\u00e9j\u00e0 cinq enfants , a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9e moyennant une caution de 1000 euro.

Mr. Obama approved the flights over the weekend, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe flights are a significant step toward direct American military action in Syria, an intervention that could alter the battlefield in the nation\u2019s three-year civil war.\n\nAdministration officials said the United States did not intend to notify the Assad government of the planned flights. Mr. Obama, who has repeatedly called for the ouster of Mr. Assad, is loath to be seen as aiding the Syrian government, even inadvertently.\nAs a result the Pentagon is drafting military options that would strike the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, near the largely erased border between those two nations, as opposed to more deeply inside Syria. The administration is also moving to bolster American support for the moderate Syrian rebels who view Mr. Assad as their main foe.\n\nOn Monday, Syria warned the White House that it needed to coordinate airstrikes against ISIS or it would view them as a breach of its sovereignty and an \u201cact of aggression.\u201d But it signaled its readiness to work with the United States in a coordinated campaign against the militants.  \n\nThe reconnaissance flights would not be the first time the United States has entered Syrian airspace without seeking permission. In July, American Special Operations forces carried out an unsuccessful rescue attempt for hostages held by ISIS, including the journalist James Foley, whose death was revealed last week in an ISIS video.\n\nMr. Obama met Monday with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and other advisers to discuss options, but the White House said Mr. Obama had not yet decided whether to order military action in Syria. The White House made clear that if the president did act, he had no plans to collaborate with Mr. Assad or even inform him in advance of any operation.\n\n\u201cIt is not the case that the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. \u201cJoining forces with Assad would essentially permanently alienate the Sunni population in both Syria and Iraq, who are necessary to dislodging ISIL,\u201d he said, using the group\u2019s alternative name, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\n\nStill, administration officials acknowledge that the sudden threat from ISIS to Americans \u2014 several of whom are still held by the militants in Syria \u2014 had complicated the calculus for the United States in a conflict Mr. Obama has largely avoided.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of cross pressures here in this situation,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. But our policy as it relates to pursuing American interests in this region of the world are actually really clear, that we want to make sure that we are safeguarding American personnel.\u201d\nUnder plans being developed by the administration, a senior official said, the United States could target leaders of the militant group in and around their stronghold, the northern city of Raqqa, as well as in isolated outposts to the east, near the Iraqi border.\n\nWhile the Syrian government has the capability to partly defend its airspace from American warplanes, American fighter jets can fly close to the border and fire on targets in Syria using long-range precision weapons.\n\nThe American military could also jam Syria\u2019s air-defense systems by sending signals that would make it difficult or impossible for radar to pick up American fighter planes entering Syrian airspace. Such a move would give fighters a limited amount of time to hit ISIS targets or camps before leaving Syria. The military could also use B-2 stealth bombers, which are almost invisible to radar, or could fire at stationary targets in Syria using Tomahawk cruise missiles, launched from ships at sea.\n\nOn Monday, even as he warned the Obama administration against unilateral strikes in Syria, Walid Muallem, the foreign minister, said, \u201cSyria is ready for cooperation and coordination at the regional and international level to fight terrorism.\u201d Mr. Assad has long tried to rally support by portraying the insurgency against him as a terrorist threat. He has made little headway with the West or his Arab neighbors.\nSyria\u2019s strategy, some former administration officials say, carries a risk for the United States, particularly if the moderate opposition is squeezed out by ISIS.", "title": "Obama Authorized Air Surveillance of ISIS in Syria", "publishedDate": "2014-08-26T17:22:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SUVEzufw_E", "description": "Mencken, Rosebud, and Roxie all work to wake up Suki, who can sleep through anything.

Atteggiamento lodevole e ricco di insegnamenti morali, ma attenzione: se uno lo segue troppo alla lettera rischia di perdere di vista certe differenze e certi confini, che invece \u00e8 giusto rispettare.\n\nhttp://www.improntaadv.com/news/3-news/55-esperimenti-bestiali.html\n\nNon parlo qui di zooerastia (su cui magari ci soffermeremo in altra occasione), ma di quel nefasto equivoco su cui si \u00e8 basata e si basa tuttora una parte consistente della ricerca scientifica: l'idea che i test e gli esperimenti condotti su alcune specie animali possano dare risultati validi anche per l'uomo.\n\nUn presupposto non solo sbagliato (perch\u00e9 le differenze genetiche fra la nostra e le altre specie rendono impossibile confrontare le reazioni dell'organismo a una specifica sostanza), ma anche pericoloso: non sono rari, nella storia recente della farmacologia, i rimedi messi sul mercato perch\u00e9 giudicati sicuri (sulla base di test condotti sugli animali), e ritirati frettolosamente in seguito a gravi effetti collaterali riscontrati negli uomini, che possono giungere fino alla morte.\n\nNessun test svolto su animali pu\u00f2 dare risultati probanti e sicuri per gli esseri umani, col risultato che -- una volta messo in commercio il farmaco -- le vere cavie siamo noi.\n\nNon avevamo le idee chiare su quest'argomento, finch\u00e9 non abbiamo parlato con Equivita, il Comitato Scientifico Antivivisezionista. Per loro abbiamo realizzato tre spot, brevi e (si spera) incisivi, puntando tutto sull'ironia e sulla freschezza del messaggio. Ci sembrava il modo migliore per denunciare il paradosso di una \"scienza\" che poggia le proprie basi su presupposti assai poco scientifici, per coprire negligenza e interessi di parte.\n\nGli spot, realizzati integralmente in animazione, si ispirano alla fortunata serie Beautiful Lab, vista di recente su Sky: movimento veloce, speaker brillante, suoni e colori da fumetto per comunicare direttamente il messaggio fondamentale: gli animali sono diversi da noi, e chiunque vi dica che un farmaco o una terapia sono sicuri perch\u00e9 li hanno testati sugli animali, o ignora questa semplice verit\u00e0 oppure la nasconde consapevolmente (e allora \u00e8 lecito sentire puzza di bruciato).", "title": "Spot Equivita - Enza la cavia!", "publishedDate": "2011-05-18T08:47:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SXsIFk3WiM", "description": "Turn On annotations for lyrics.

He is widely credited with inventing the Fosbury flop, a back-first jumping technique that revolutionised the high jump. He developed the flop aged 16 after finding the standard techniques difficult.\n\nAt the time, jumpers took off from their inside foot and swung their outside foot up and over the bar. Fosbury's technique was to race up to the bar at great speed and take off from his right (or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head first with his back to the bar.\n\nHis technique truly changed the sport at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Despite scepticism from judges and coaches, Fosbury cleared every height up to 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold medal. By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury flop.\n\nFind out more about Richard Fosbury: http://www.olympic.org/richard-douglas-fosbury", "title": "Dick Fosbury Changes The High Jump Forever - Fosbury Flop- Mexico 1968 Olympics", "publishedDate": "2013-02-09T10:30:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Sl_XprxgQ8", "description": "DIRECT LINKS & DOWNLOAD AVAILABLE IN \"ABOUT BOX\"\n\nDIRECT DOUWNLOAD LINK:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/listen/a33452pme6dcb78/DJ%20TICAL%20%26%20MPH%20-%20The%20Hoods%20Favorite.mp3 )\n\nPLAY IT, DOWNLOAD IT & SHARE IT @ SOUNDCLOUD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/doityaselfent/dj-tical-m-p-h-the-hoods )\n\nDJ TICAL & M.P.H - The Hood's Favorite \"Produced by DJ TICAL & Rubin Nightmares off the album\n\nThe self titled street album \"DJ TICAL & M.P.H\" Executive Producer: HDirt & DJ TICAL (COMING SOON!)\n\nLIKE US ON ALL OF OUR PAGES FACEBOOK PAGES & COMMUNITY!

They all brought the same message: worship only God, and stop worshipping human beings and their ideas.\n\n\nNew York (CNN) -- Six months ago, a Long Island convenience store owner turned a would-be robbery into an act of compassion. On Wednesday, the shoplifter made amends with a $50 bill and a thank you letter for saving him from a life of crime.\nThe story began in May 2009, when Mohammad Sohail of Shirley, New York, was closing his Shirley Express convenience store one night. Security camera footage from that evening shows a man wielding a baseball bat barging into the store and demanding money.\nSohail had a rifle ready and quickly aimed it directly in the robber's face, forcing the man to drop the bat and lay on the ground. Unbeknownst to the man, Sohail never loads his gun.\nAccording to Sohail, the man immediately started to plead with him, tearfully saying, \"I'm sorry, I have no food. I have no money. My whole family is hungry. Don't call the police. Don't shoot me.\"\n\"When I see him starting crying [those] things, I really feel bad for him,\" said Sohail. \"I say, oh man, this is something different.\"\nSohail made the man pledge never to rob anybody ever again, then gave the man $40 and a loaf bread. Sohail, who is from Pakistan, said the man then wanted to be a Muslim like him, so he recited an Islamic oath and gave the would-be robber the name Nawaz Sharif Zardari.\nSohail went to get some milk, but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food.Both Mohammad Sohail and Suffolk County Police have no idea who the man is. After the May incident, Sohail explained that he will \"absolutely not\" be pressing charges, though police are still investigating the case\nOver the past six months, Sohail's story of sympathy and kindness has inspired many across the country.\nThe Shirley Express store has received numerous letters of admiration. \n\"No person has ever moved my spirit the way you did. From your biggest admirer,\" one letter says. \"Great men are capable of great acts. You are a great American,\" another reads.\nHe has also received several checks with such messages for \"a couple hundred dollars\" in total, says Sohail. He has made a point to give this money \"to the people\" by offering free bagels, rolls and coffee in his store every night after 9 o'clock.\nBut the envelope that arrived on Wednesday came as a surprise. Postmarked November 11 without a return address, it enclosed a $50 bill and a note apparently from the would-be robber. \n\nThe typed letter begins, \"You change My Life (sic),\" and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago.\n\"At the time I had No money No food on my table No Job, and nothing for my family. I know that it was wrong, but I had know (sic) choice. I needed to feed My family. When You had That gun to my head I was 100% that I was going to die,\" reads the letter.\nThe letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a \"True Muslim\" and that his life has changed dramatically.\n\"I'm very happy that somebody got to change his life,\" Sohail said. \"If he is a maybe criminal, maybe is not anymore. So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that. He's staying out of trouble, he's not in a jail, he's taking care of his family.\"", "title": "Muslim VS Robber", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06T03:32:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SmaslV7Jrc", "description": "opening of the gig and the opening to 'Sell out'", "title": "Opening of Reel Big Fish Gig (Live in Newcastle 2011)", "publishedDate": "2011-04-22T20:08:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SmxM_RV0jg", "description": "Lonnie plays Five Nights at Freddy's (iPhone Gameplay Video)\n\nThis is part 1 of my video game commentary playthrough / walkthrough series of \"Let's play Five Nights at Freddy's\" for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and any other iOS devices.\n\nIn this episode: Chuck E.

If you have a newer device this shouldn't be a problem!\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\"For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n( Description via iTunes store / http://lonniedos.com/1m8Tl4J )\n\nThanks for watching! ^_^", "title": "FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S - Night 1 (iPhone Gameplay Video)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T18:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Sn3hcjQqXg", "description": "Being selected as a Trustee Scholar is the highest honor a Ringling College student can be awarded and acknowledges the accomplishments of students who demonstrate campus leadership and community service, as well as excellence in their work.

Water is introduced gradually over a series of sessions.\n\nHow it works: The horses walk on a moving Treadmill belt and as the water is added they lift their legs up out of the water in a more vertical plane. This has the benefit of increasing joint flexion and exaggerates the use of the back muscles. With no rider to influence the horse's way of going the muscles develop symmetrically as the horse works in balance and without interference in a straight line.\n\nThe water reduces concussive forces allowing the safe strengthening of muscles and tendons. Whilst the water does provide a degree of buoyancy and support around the limbs, the horse has to work hard against the increased resistance of the water and this will develop stride length on dry land, tighten core stomach muscles and the ligaments around the stifle. The cold water on the lower limbs provides a massaging and cooling effect excellent for horses recovering from tendon problems.\n\nContact info:\nNo: 087 9362525", "title": "Aqua Equine Treadmill", "publishedDate": "2013-09-24T22:32:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SonB-f5fZU", "description": "The first opening of Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne \nSong: Piece of Love", "title": "Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne Opening 1", "publishedDate": "2010-05-27T04:15:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Sp55w_SnvI", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Nitrile glove vs laser", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T04:07:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SpFtt5bn_Q", "description": "Level 14 of the game Snow Drift http://nitrome.com/games/snowdrift/", "title": "Nitrome  - Snow Drift Level 14", "publishedDate": "2010-01-23T10:35:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SpTr9SkgKM", "description": "http://www.ostracodfiles.com/light/menu.html", "title": "Maze Generation on the DUO Light", "publishedDate": "2014-10-02T12:33:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SqPVGy6s1E", "description": "Lady Loxley (Lord Ferragamo/With Approval/Vice Regent) is a 2010 Westphalian Filly.

In his sense \" A scientist is he , who sees simple and thinks highly\".\nSchool science & people science\n\n To incorporate this fact, among the children and common man Mihir panda introduced one innovative programme  \"simple innovation for my nation \" and popularly known as \"simple innovation \".In this arrangement problem of science and mathematics teaching can be intelligently tackled by making the low cost and no cost models and  common people get the idea to manufacture the innovative household materials. It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987. Though he had not got any financial aid or assistance from anybody but the organisation is decorated with thousand and thousands of scientific models, a garden of five acres, a laboratory measuring 150'-0\"x15'-0\" , sophisticated Audiovisual systems, workshop to materialise the thoughts of the children etc. He had a jeep which is used to transport his models to different rural  areas for displaying of  \"simple innovation \" programmefor which he do not accept any fees. Different kinds of new models are built in the workshop by the students under the strong supervision of the resource person of SROSTI. Of course, this laboratory is a living wonder in the realm of science. \nThat, Mihir panda had constantly been rendering service since 1987 to popularize science and mathematics among the millions of students ,teachers and common people through programme \"simple innovation\". He had manufacturing low cost models from the waste and unused materials  & instrumental in changing and enriching the lives of the rest in the society by inculcating a sense of positive attitude in their mind towards science. Being fired by the zeal of dedication and determination Mihir panda had been devoting most of my time and energy for making science easily, accessibly to anybody and everybody. The students who were immensely preoccupied with fear psychosis especially for science and mathematics have tremendously changed their attitude and developed an appetite for learning science and mathematics in a jocund manner.  The simple innovation of Mihir panda had helped the farmers, phycally challanged persons,house wives and for any body.His  hundreds of innovations are  counted for people science.\nAlthough in recognition to his research he had been awarded by different organizations, but it is a matter of regret that, he had not received any financial assistance from any Govt./Non Govt. organization, as a matter of fact he had been passing through a precarious financial position and pressing hard to materialize his noble dream by Playing cheerfully with science and mathematics. \nIn his Laboratory there are more than Thirty Thousand model designs to demonstrate the different experiments of science through Audio-visual class, play way methods to learn science and mathematics, observing natural Bonsai and many more...  for the teachers and students as well   without any fee.", "title": "addition and subtraction-how to explain1", "publishedDate": "2011-05-11T04:25:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9SzzJuvoO9Y", "description": "Hey, feel free to request pieces on facebook or twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/ThomasAnPiano\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Thomas-Andersen/274241352758\n\nPlease Like it if you did?!:) \nAlso, remember to subscribe for Lots of Zelda SS pieces!\n\nEasy Tutorial:\nhttp://youtu.be/py3nyx0L44s\n\nRegular Tutorial:\nhttp://youtu.be/AGMAS008ng8\n\nThe Ballad of the Goddess or as some calls it: \"The Goddess Song\"\n\nI did this all by ear, and I feel somewhat satisfied with my arrangement and performance!
