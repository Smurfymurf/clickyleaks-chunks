Our current system of economics and politics (as they have converged to a point which is hard to distinguish) is fundamentally unsustainable. It relies on debt and exponential growth, and operates on an abstracted belief system that ignores our finite world resources. Technocracy is a post-capitalist economic system devised and developed in 1920s America by academics and scientists as a solution to the waste and unsustainability of capitalism. Like capitalism (and communism/socialism etc.), it does not concern itself with scarcity, but rather with abundance, with the view that the capacity exists to feed, clothe and shelter everyone in the world. This does not happen with the current system as 'there is no way to sell an abundance'. This has shown itself increasingly as false scarcity is imposed on us in the form of digital rights management, licensing for broadcasters, action against peer-to-peer services etc. \n\nThe Technocrat Retrofit of London occurs circa 2070, and marks a return to the community driven sustainable way of living so often romanticised by architects, but with the help of less fashionable technology and top-down systems of government. The stock market has crashed and the pound has moved into hyper-inflation. Banks are deserted. The mayor of London negotiates with a powerless central government to transform the square mile into a contained self-sufficient Technocratic state. \n\nBuildings are retrofitted to create a sustainable self-sufficient community. Aerostats above the city support tethered wind turbines in the polar jet stream, supplying electricity to the Technate. Sunlight is the most scarce resource in the city, so a canopy of hydroponic greenhouses covers the Technate. Many existing buildings are used to house industrial and agricultural processes, located and inter-linked for efficiency and reuse of waste products.", "title": "The Technocrat Retrofit of London", "publishedDate": "2009-05-31T15:57:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4teJuhCELII", "description": "Thrash/Death Metal (Belo Horizonte/MG - BR)\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/hellthrashmetal\nDownload: http://www.mediafire.com/?q77ys5p9lw9wcir", "title": "Hellthrash - Abysm of Fear", "publishedDate": "2011-12-08T02:00:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tebLYqyXog", "description": "Danny wellbeck is a gret fottballer but he has a problem in the last third.

If you heard Kid President, chances are better you know exactly who that is.  The 9-year-old from west TN has been a huge hit on YouTube from his witty skits to meeting the *real* president.  Only on Fox, we sat down with this funny 3rd grader who's got a serious message all while battling a rare disorder.In his videos, you see him in his black suit and red tie with that contagious laugh and always seems to be dancing.  But there is a serious message from Robby Novak, otherwise known as Kid President.  It just matters if you're nice to everyone says Novak.  That's just one of his messages from his YouTube video Pep Talk which has more than 22 million views.  He encourages kids to make the world less boring.The concept of Kid President was the brain child of his brother-in-law Brad Montague who was promoting an event at Freed-Hardeman University in Henderson, TN where he works.  The next thing he and Robby knew, the videos went viral!   Kid President became famous, although his friends are quick to bring him down to earth saying my friends don't really care that I have fame and stuff.  Since being in the spotlight, Kid President has been all over the country from Hollywood to D.C.  His biggest thrill was meeting the real president.  President Barack Obama invited Novak to the oval office.   it was really fun meeting the president, it was an honor says Novak.  The President told him to keep doing what he's doing and Robby is taking his advice speaking to kids all over the country to make this world a better place.  One of his regular stops is at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital in Nashville.  He doesn't come to entertain the kids, he comes as a patient.  Novak suffers from a rare bone disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta also known as Brittle Bone Syndrome.  In his nine years, he's had more than 70 broken bones!   Dr. Jill Simmons, a pediatric endocrinologist at Vandy, says Robby's had a great attitude in spite of some significant pain and lots of surgeries.  Obviously, Robby is banned from playing sports and although his adoptive parents Laurie and David Novak are protective, they want to make sure he can still be a kid and that includes allowing Robby to wrestle around with his big sister Alexia who also has the same bone disorder.  Every 13 weeks, Robby comes to Vanderbilt Children's to get an intravenous infusion, a 5-hour long process to make his bones stronger.  the infusions do a great job at decreasing fracture rate, decreasing bone pain says Dr. Simmons.The prognosis for Robby and his sister is excellent according to Dr. Simmons.  Both understand what they can and can't do.  So, if Robby wants to be president someday, he can!  But does he want to?  Nah, too much paperwork says Novak.His brother-in-law, Brad says what's inspiring about Robby isn't his bone condition, but the fact that his condition doesn't define who he is.

Quasars are the extremely bright centers of galaxies surrounding super-massive black holes, and binary quasars are pairs of quasars bound together by gravity. Binary quasars, like other quasars, are thought to be the product of galaxy mergers. Until now, however, binary quasars have not been seen in galaxies that are unambiguously in the act of merging.  But images of a new binary quasar from the Carnegie Institutions Magellan telescope in Chile show two distinct galaxies with tails produced by tidal forces from their mutual gravitational attraction.\n\nThis is really the first case in which you see two separate galaxies, both with quasars, that are clearly interacting, says Carnegie astronomer John Mulchaey who made observations crucial to understanding the galaxy merger.\n\nMost, if not all, large galaxies, such as our galaxy the Milky Way, host super-massive black holes at their centers. Because galaxies regularly interact and merge, astronomers have assumed that binary super-massive black holes have been common in the Universe, especially during its early history. Black holes can only be detected as quasars when they are actively accreting matter, a process that releases vast amounts of energy. A leading theory is that galaxy mergers trigger accretion, creating quasars in both galaxies. Because most of such mergers would have happened in the distant past, binary quasars and their associated galaxies are very far away and therefore difficult for most telescopes to resolve.\n\nThe binary quasar, labeled SDSS J1254+0846, was initially detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a large scale astronomical survey of galaxies and over 120,000 quasars. Further observations by Paul Green of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and colleagues using NASAs Chandras X-ray Observatory and telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Palomar Observatory in California indicated that the object was likely a binary quasar in the midst of a galaxy merger. Carnegies Mulchaey then used the 6.5 meter Baade-Magellan telescope at the Las Campanas observatory in Chile to obtain deeper images and more detailed spectroscopy of the merging galaxies.\n\nJust because you see two galaxies that are close to each other in the sky doesnt mean they are merging, says Mulchaey. But from the Magellan images we can actually see tidal tails, one from each galaxy, which suggests that the galaxies are in fact interacting and are in the process of merging.\n\nThomas Cox, now a fellow at the Carnegie Observatories, corroborated this conclusion using computer simulations of the merging galaxies. When Coxs model galaxies merged, they showed features remarkably similar to what Mulchaey observed in the Magellan images. The model verifies the merger origin for this binary quasar system, he says. It also hints that this kind of galaxy interaction is a key component of the growth of black holes and production of quasars throughout our universe.\n \nImage caption: This optical image of SDSS J1254+0846 obtained May 22, 2009 on the IMACS camera at the Magellan/Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile shows the two bright quasar nuclei as well as the tidal arms of the host galaxy merger. Scale bar is 10 arcseconds. (Courtesy John Mulchaey/Paul Green)\n \nMovie caption: This movie of a numerical simulation shows a galaxy merger similar to SDSS J1254+0846 over a time span of 3.6 billion years (Gyr). At 2.33 Gyr the two model galaxies and their quasars resemble the image observed with the Magellan telescope. (Courtesy T.J.

Pictures. Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point. The film adaptation had languished in one form of development hell or another for years after the book's release, with various directors on and off the project, including Terry Gilliam, David Hayter, and Darren Aronofsky, as well as Paul Greengrass, whose eventual dismissal stemmed from budget conflicts with the studio.\n\nwatchmen,\"watchmen clip\",\"watchmen soundtrack\",\"watchmen intro\",\"malin akerman\",\"billy crudup\",\"patrick wilson\",\"patrick sabongui\",\"laura mennell\",\"louis chirillo\",\"santo lombardo\",\"john shaw\",\"john tench\",\"zack snyder\",\"gun videos\",\"knife videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"action adventure\",\"comic books and superheroes\",\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++353567,/m/03whvs9,/m/030hcs,/m/05sytds,/m/0by4zmm,/m/0gb_htw,/m/055zkh,/m/08258z,/m/03ydczt", "title": "Watchmen (2/9) Movie CLIP - Face to Face with Dr. Manhattan (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T09:34:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4u-UV2ckr-M", "description": "Tune in Sundays 11am/10c\n\nFor 20 years, Marianne Williamson has been a pioneer on the front lines of a worldwide spiritual movement aimed at creating a global shift in collective consciousness.

The only performer I could find for this song was Cowboy Copas\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn old British folk tale seeks to explain the Robin's distinctive breast. Legend has it that when Jesus was dying on the cross, the Robin, then simply brown in colour, flew to his side and sang into his ear in order to comfort him in his pain. The blood from his wounds stained the Robin's breast, and thereafter all Robins got the mark of Christ's blood upon them. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Legend Of The First Robin\n\nOne day, long ago, a little bird in Galilee saw a large crowd gathered around a Man carrying a heavy wooden cross.  On the Man's head was a crown  made from a thorn branch. The thorns were long and sharp. \n \n The little bird saw that the thorns were hurting the Man. It wanted to help Him, so it flew down and took the longest, sharpest thorn in its tiny beak. \n\n  The bird tugged and pulled until the thorn snapped from the branch. Then a strange thing happened. A drop of blood fell onto the bird's breast, staining it bright red. \n\n The stain never went away. And so today the robin proudly wears a red breast, because it helped a Man named Jesus. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Legend Of The Robin\n\nLong ago, long ago,\nWhen times were stranger,\nOnce a Lady and her Son\nResyed in a manger,\n\nIn a manger on the straw.\nThe night was shrewd, the wind was raw,\n\nAnd the dull fire, untended, kept\nNo comfort where the Infant slept.\n\nThen she, too spent to mend the spark,\nSpoke to the beast-enfolding dark.\n\n\"Oxen, lest He should come to harm,\nRise up and blow these embers warm\n\nWith youe great breath, for mercy's sake.\"\nBut the rapt oxen did not wake.\n\n\"Ass, will you breathe upon the flame?\"\nBut the ass dozed nor heard his name,\n\nWhile heavy the cart horse dreamed beside\nHis feeding box that Christmastide.\n\nThen suddenly the midnight stirred.\nIn from the winter at her word\nThere flew a brown, south-seeking bird.\n\nBravest of small created things,\nHe made a bellows of his wings.\n\nHe puffed his feathers to a fan,\nSinging, until the ash began\n\nTo kindle, to glow, to burn its best.\nThe flame leaped out. It seared his breast,\n\nBut still the robin, loud with praise,\nBeat his quick wings before the blaze\n\nSo all the stable was beguiled\nTo warmth. And softly slept the Child.\n\n\"Dear robin,\" then the Lady said,\n\"Wear from now on a breast of red.\n\nWhere the fire was, let fire remain,\nA blessed and perpetual stain\n\nBurnt on your heart that all may see\nThe signature of Charity.\"\n\nLong ago, long ago\nWhen times were stranger\nOnce a robin served the Lord\n\nWho rested in a manger.", "title": "LEGEND OF THE ROBIN RED BREAST BY ROY STERNHAGEN.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-05-08T01:04:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4u5kJvbgtb0", "description": "Dr. Dan Gamblin, DVM, with Goliad Animal Clinic conducts a bovine trichomoniasis collection demonstration at the 2009 Tri County Blanconia Field Day.

The foremost religion is in emotional fervour, while the unbelievers host a council of members dedicated to complete religious domination of the planet, having manufactured a mobile atomic weapon. Fearing for the nuclear devastation this might cause, the covert Galactic Police Federation send Jim Long and his crew, Gail, and Norman, all of them in disguise, to seek out its leaders. \n The trail leads to a huge building on the edge of a desert used as a training complex. The advanced technology of the Federation operated by Jim intrigues one of the religious leaders as other planetary agents converge on their position. The battle to stop the fanatical operatives exploding a portable nuclear weapon begins, with the lives of ten million city-dwellers at stake.

DE CE ? Pentru ca, spun jupuitorii chinezi, \u201eEste mai ieftin si mai usor sa jupoi un animal viu si cald decat un corp mort. Pielea iese mai usor si dintr-o singura bucata\".\n\n2.000.000 de caini si pisici sunt jupuiti anual in China zilelor noastre si lasati sa moara incet, intr-o durere inimaginabila.\n\nComertul international cu blana aduce prosperitate, cel mai adesea cumparatorii nebanuind ce orori ascunde haina lor. \"Tu a cui blana o porti?\" CINE CUMPARA PRODUSE DIN BLANA? NOI LE CUMPARAM! Oamenii cumpara imbracaminte, accesorii, jucarii confectionate din blana.\n\nMai mult, chinezii consuma carne de caine si pisica. Ei cumpara de la piata carnea acestor animale cum cumparam noi din piata carne de porc, de vita... Zeci de caini si pisici stau inghesuiti intr-o cusca \"asteptandu-si\" cumparatorii. Anul acesta o asociatie pentru protectia animalelor din China a strans mana de la mana 18.000 dolari sa cumpere 500 de caini si pisici dintr-un tir care-i ducea la piata... Mai rau, chinezii au obiceiul sa bata cainii inainte sa-i consume, \"ca sa se fragezeasca carnea\". Un martor ocular roman a povestit asociatiei noastre cum a vazut in China un asemenea caz, in care cainele fusese atat de batut incat \"nici nu mai avea puterea sa schelalaie\"... In China exista un proiect de lege din 2010 care sa interzica consumul de carne de caine si pisica.\n\nIn jur de 50 de iubitori de animale si ONG-uri au cerut ambasadei sa faca lobby pe langa Guvernul si Parlamentul Chinez. S-a semnat un memoriu de catre toti participantii. El va fi depus ulterior, impreuna cu material video si foto de la actiune.\n\nPe aceasta cale am SOLICITAT Chinei sa introduca o legislatie pentru bunastarea animalelor, care sa asigure:\n1. Interzicerea uciderii cainilor, pisicilor si altor animale prin jupuirea lor de vii;\n2. Interzicerea de catre China a exportului de blana provenind de la caini si pisici.\n3.

Contribute your a bit to be the green change we wish to see.\n\nCarpooling will save YOU money\nCarpooling allows you to share the cost of gas and parking, cutting your expenses by nearly 50% or more; the more occupants in your carpool the more you save.  Carpooling is also socially economical.  Not only will you be saving, but you will also help reduce the costs we all pay towards the construction of new roads, road maintenance and air pollution related health costs. \n\nCarpooling is better for the environment\nHaving fewer cars on the road means reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and improved air quality.\n\nIt's good for your health\nAccording to Environment Canada, air pollution caused by vehicular travel is linked to a number of health concerns including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, allergies and neurological effects.  By carpooling, you help reduce these health risks for yourself and everyone else. Research also suggests that carpooling is less stressful than commuting alone. \n\nCarpooling is convenient\nCarpooling provides commuting convenience comparable to driving alone, with less stress and with the added bonus of companionship while you're commuting.  Carpooling partners establish their own unique rules that best meet the needs of their carpool.\n\nCarpooling improves your commuting options\nCarpooling offers a commuter option that may work better than other methods of transportation.

Species of Euglena are found in fresh and salt waters.

However, they can also take nourishment heterotrophically, like animals. Since Euglena have features of both animals and plants, early taxonomists, working within the Linnaean two-kingdom system of biological classification, found them difficult to classify.

From the sixteenth-century the commerce developed in Scotland around Glasgow and Edinburgh and throughout the seventeenth-century Dutch and German pewter found the fore.\n\nAlthough English pewter is understood to day back to the tenth-century, few illustrations now exist before these made in the 17th century, likely because much would have already been ruined throughout the reformation. Initially - until the fourteenth-century pewter - would happen to be used only from the nobility or for ecclesiastical functions. Pewter likely reached its zenith in the specific context of domestic use in the 17th century after supplanting wood tableware from the sixteenth-century onwards.\n\nEven though it additionally lingered for a while in in London chop properties and hostels and pubs where it held sway to get a large amount of time from around 1780 onwards pewter once again became primarily the preserve of the upper crust.\n\nIn the broader context of the universe of antiques pewter via England is usually considered to the top-notch type. This perhaps comes from the truth that English pewter tended to be dignified and more strong than its international counterparts.

It gets its common names from its host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most swallowtail butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly has also been referred to as the Butterfly of Death, a name it shares with a morphologically similar species, Papilio demodocus, which flies in Africa. The butterfly is apest and invasive species from the Old World which has spread to the Caribbean and Central America.. It is also a frequent visitor of flowers in gardens, where it shows a preference for flowers of smaller herbs rather than larger plants such as the ubiquitousLantana with its plentiful blooms. It can be found swarming in the groves of its foodplants\nThis butterfly is an avid mud-puddler and visitor of flowers. It basks with its wings held wide open on tufts of grass, herbs and generally keeps within a metre above the ground, even on cloudy days. It relies on its quick flight for escape.[9] It is an interesting butterfly in that it has a number of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail. As the day progresses, it flies fast, straight and low. In the hotter part of the day, it may be found settling on damp patches where it will remain motionless, except for an occasional flutter of wings, if not disturbed.The butterfly is tailless and has a wingspan 80--100 mm.[1]:52 Above, the background colour is black. A broad, irregular yellow band is found on the wings above, which is broken in the case of the forewing. Besides this the butterfly has a large number of irregular spots on the wing. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot with blue edging around it. As the butterfly caterpillar ages, its hunger for leaf tissue continues to grow.\nThe widespread range of Papilio demoleus indicates the butterfly's tolerance and adaptation to diverse habitats. It is to be found insavannahs, fallow lands, gardens, evergreen and semi-evergreen forests and shows a preference for stream and riverbeds. In India it is mostly found in the plains but can be found on the hills of peninsular India and up to 7000 feet in the Himalayas. It is common in urban gardens .\nThe Common Emigrant or Lemon Emigrant (Catopsilia pomona) is a medium sized pierid butterfly found in Asia and parts of Australia. The species gets its name from its habit of migration. Some early authors considered them as two distinct species Catopsilia crocale and Catopsilia pomona.The upperside of the male is chalky-white, sometimes with a more or less broad and clearly defined basal sulphur-yellow area on both fore and hind wings; this sulphur-yellow colour is at times diffused over the whole surface of the wings, though generally it becomes paler towards the terminal margins. \"On the female upperside the ground-color varies as in the male, but sometimes it is chalky white at the bases of the wings, with the terminal margins more or less broadly sulphur-yellow. Fore wings always with a round, occasionally quadrate, black discocellular spot variable in size; in some specimens the costa is black only towards the apex of the wing, in others broadly black throughout and opposite the apex of cell so widened out as to touch the discocellular spot.The eggs of the butterfly are laid in small batches on various species of plants including several Cassias. Other host plants include Butea monosperma, Cassia fistula, Bauhinia spp., Pterocarpus indicus, Senna alata and Sesbania species.", "title": "Lemon Butterfly with Common Emigrants Butterfly of Raipur Melghat Tiger Reserve Fulpakharu", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T17:59:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vCpWZwq7RM", "description": "Saint Porphyry Of Gaza", "title": "Saint Porphyry Of Gaza - Feb. 26", "publishedDate": "2010-02-26T19:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vCzQ9xFenM", "description": "Family Advocacy Center, Sojourner Family Peace Center was a 2011 finalist for the PNC Trail Blazer Award honored by LISC Milwaukee at the 12th Annual Milwaukee Awards for Neighborhood Development Innovation sponsored by US Bank.", "title": "Family Advocacy Center, Sojourner Family Peace Center: 2011 MANDI Finalist", "publishedDate": "2011-04-12T17:12:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vD-1FVk6RY", "description": "http://video.chaparral-racing.com/?v=1216281873 Watch this video featuring products from EVS Sports and buy from a large selection on chaparral-racing.com.

Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food.

They were one of the most popular rock groups of the early 1970s, a primary example of what later was labeled \"soft rock\", releasing a string of well-crafted, melodic soft rock singles.\nThe band consisted of David Gates, Jimmy Griffin, Robb Royer, Mike Botts, and Larry Knechtel. \nGates, Griffin, and Royer joined together in 1968 and signed with Elektra Records choosing the name Bread in 1969. Gates and Griffin had both worked with Royer's previous band, The Pleasure Fair. Bread's first single, \"Dismal Day\", was released in June 1969 but did not chart. Their debut album, Bread, was released in September 1969 and peaked at #127 on the Billboard 200. Songwriting on the album was split evenly between Gates and the team of Griffin-Royer. Jim Gordon, a top session player, accompanied the band on drums for the album.\nBread became a quartet with their second album, On the Waters (peaking at #12 on the Billboard 200), bringing in Botts as drummer. This time their efforts quickly established Bread as a major act, hitting the mainstream with the Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit \"Make It with You\" in 1970. \"Make It With You\" would be Bread's only number one hit on the Hot 100.\nFor their next single, they released a re-recorded version of \"It Don't Matter to Me\", a Gates song from their first album. This single was a hit as well, reaching #10. Bread began touring and recording the 1971 album titled Manna (#21), which included the Top 5 hit single, \"If\". As with the first album, songwriting credits were split evenly between Gates and Griffin-Royer.\nRoyer left the group after three albums; although, he would continue to write with Griffin\u2014and was replaced by Knechtel, a leading session player from the Los Angeles scene. In January 1972, Bread released Baby I'm-a Want You, their most successful album, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200. The title song was established as a hit in late 1971 before the album was released, also hitting #3. Follow-up singles \"Everything I Own\" and \"Diary\" also went top-20. The next album, Guitar Man, was released ten months later and went to #18. The album produced three top-15 singles, \"The Guitar Man\" (#11), \"Sweet Surrender\" (#15), and \"Aubrey\" (#15), with the first two going to #1 on Billboard's adult contemporary chart. The band would have a total of four #1 singles on this chart; \"If\" and \"Baby I'm-a Want You\" had also reached the top of the adult contemporary chart during their respective chart runs.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nLost and all alone\nI always thought that I could make it on my own\nSince you left I hardly make it through the day\nMy tears get in the way\nAnd I need you back to stay\n\nI wander through the night\nAnd search the world to find\nThe words to make it right\nAll I want is just the way it used to be\nWith you here close to me\nI've got to make you see\n\nThat I'm lost without your love\nLife without you isn't worth the trouble of\nI'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel\nA touch without a feel\nI can't believe it's real...\n\nAnd someday soon I'll wake\nAnd find my heart won't have to break\n\nYes I'm lost without your love\nLife without you isn't worth the trouble of\nAll I want is just the way it used to be\nI need you here with me\nOh darlin' can't you see...\nIf we had love before\nWe can have it back once more", "title": "Lost without your love- Bread", "publishedDate": "2009-12-11T08:26:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vOzPpugexI", "description": "A video in which I explain to Crystal my discovery of the term \"Americanism\" and attempt a British accent... it's not very good.", "title": "Americanism??", "publishedDate": "2013-05-15T01:21:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vPboQwBNh4", "description": "Watch more Pet Bird Care videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/509313-Cockatoo-vs-Cockatiel-Pet-Bird\n\nLearn how to take care of a cockatoo in this Howcast video featuring veterinarian Laurie Hess.\n\n\nDr. Laurie: Cockatoo's are great pets. They are larger birds. They are probably the most social bird that we see. They're very interactive. They love to snuggle with their owner's. They're one of the most popular birds, because they provide so much back to their owners. They're very sweet and cuddly and they're kind of like the puppy dog of the bird world I guess. At the same time, all this love and attention brings some problems, unfortunately. We do see quite a few behavioral problems in these birds. Sarah, why don't you mention a few. \n\nSarah: One of the biggest problems I think that people realize the most with their cockatoo is that they cuddle with their cockatoo for a couple of hours and they put the cockatoo back in the cage to go to bed or to rest and the cockatoo immediately starts to scream to resume said attention, and unfortunately people's first reaction is to run back to quiet the cockatoo and this unfortunately, reinforces the screaming and will perpetuate the issue. What people really need to learn how to do is to ignore it. The bird starts screaming, walk away. Once the bird quiets, then you can come back in, handle the bird and reinforce the quiet. That can really help with those behavioral issues. \n \nDr. Laurie: All right, so if you're going to have a cockatoo realize that this bird is very bonded to you. You have to be very careful that you are not accidentally reinforcing that screaming behavior that develops. Again, it's human nature to run to the cage and say,\"Stop screaming. Shut up, stop,\" and that just makes the bird want to do it more. We want to cuddle them, but we don't want to give them mixed messages, that maybe we want to bond with them in an inappropriate way, a sexual way. This can be very frustrating to birds. \n\nIt's nice to have a cockatoo. They're great birds. They require fresh fruit and vegetables everyday and a base pelleted diet. They require showering, because they are very powdery birds. They have powder down, which is that sort of powdery stuff that come's off their feathers, so they do require bathing everyday. They require fresh air and sunlight and all the things we recommend for our other bird species. But because they are so socially needy, they have a special kind of relationship with their owners that you really have to watch, so that  we don't' get into those behavioral problems.", "title": "How to Take Care of a Cockatoo | Pet Bird", "publishedDate": "2013-06-21T01:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4vPih6JALeM", "description": "Ritual Dance - Michael Hedges, Kaki King (August Rush).

Las femeninas son solitarias.\n\nEl fruto es una bellota con c\u00fapula espinosa que cubre el fruto en su mitad, lo que la hace reconocible y diferenciable de otros Quercus.\n\nEn la naturaleza se da en zonas c\u00e1lidas, secas y soleadas, con sustrato indiferente. Es m\u00e1s xer\u00f3fila que la encina y convive con otras querc\u00edneas y matorral mediterr\u00e1neo. \n\nAntes se usaba para le\u00f1a y carb\u00f3n de muy buena calidad. Tambi\u00e9n para alimentaci\u00f3n animal y por los tintes rojos que se extra\u00edan de las agallas que produce el insecto Coccus ilicis.\n\nEn jardiner\u00eda se usa como arbusto siempreverde, resistente al sol, las temperaturas altas y la sequ\u00eda. Permite el recorte y la poda. En setos espinosos combina bien con otras especies.\n\nSu reproducci\u00f3n se hace por semillas. Al igual que con otras bellotas se suelen poner en agua y desechar las que flotan. El resto se siembra poniendo tumbada la semilla y enterrada unos 2 \u00f3 3 cm en el sustrato o en el suelo.\n\nM\u00e1s sobre LA COSCOJA (Quercus coccifera) en: http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es/2012/01/la-coscoja-quercus-coccifera.html\n\nOtro v\u00eddeo en: http://youtu.be/d1rNyK9D51c", "title": "LA COSCOJA: Quercus coccifera (http://riomoros.blogspot.com.es)", "publishedDate": "2012-11-14T13:50:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4voSs8M3qf0", "description": "Cyrilla George a well known personality in Abu Dhabi regales everyone with Christmas carols during St. Joseph's Christmas Festival 2012 held at St. Joseph's Church premises on 7th December 2012.

Workers giving touches by using various tools to make a polished gemstones out of a rough crystal at a refining workshop. It involves cutting, polishing and selling precious gemstones and metals such as diamonds, gold and other precious stones. \n\n\nThe gems and jewellery sector has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in India in the past few years. The sector has gained global popularity because of its talented craftsmen, its superior practices in cutting and polishing fine diamonds and precious stones, and its cost-efficiencies. The sector has been vital to the Indian economy as well; during 2008-09, the sector accounted for around 13% of the country\u2019s total exports.\n\nGold jewellery is the most preferred form of jewellery in demand in India as it is considered auspicious to purchase gold on major occasions like festivals, marriage, birth etc. Also, gold occupies the second position among all investment instruments and is considered as the safest investment option. According to the data released by the World Gold Council (WGC), India is the largest consumer of gold. In 2008, India consumed approximately 660 tonnes of gold and accounted for 22.71% of the total gold consumed all over the world, most of which was used in jewellery. Even though the gold demand remained weak, India continued to maintain its second position in the third quarter-ended 2009 as well and accounted for 20.87% of the total gold consumed all over the world.\n\nIndia is also one of the largest diamond processor in the world and its artisans have specialised skills in processing small diamonds (below one carat); in fact, the Indian craftsmen have achieved excellence in cutting and polishing small diamonds. However, the real uniqueness of the Indian craftsmen lies in the fact that they do most of the cutting and polishing manually which sets India apart from its other peers. India (especially, Surat and Mumbai) ranks among the \u2018big four\u2019 diamond cutting centres of the world \u2014 the other three being, Belgium (Antwerp), the US (New York) and Israel (Ramat Gan). Currently, diamonds processed in India account for 85% in volume, 92% in pieces and 60% in value of the total world diamond market.\n\nThe gems and jewellery sector in India is highly export-oriented, labour-intensive and a major contributor to the foreign exchange earnings; therefore, the Indian government has declared the sector as a thrust area for export promotion.\n\nSource: https://www.dnb.co.in/IndianGemsandJewellerySector/Overview.asp\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\".

Adult females are larger (up to 120 mm and 130g) than adult males (up to 72 mm and 60g). (Duellman and Lizana, 1994). Color patterns are variable greens, browns, and beige with darker streaks of greens and browns. The ventral side shows a light colored body with uniform dark pigmentation on the throat (Lynch 1982). Like other members of the genus, C. cornuta possesses heavy calcification, ornamentation, casquing, and a hyperossified cranium. The skull is strong and akinetic, with all bones but the premaxilla, columellae, and the septomaxilla fused. A pronounced interocular crest characterizes this species. Other autapomorphies include the absence of a carina from the zygomatic region to the maxilla below the eye, the absence of vomerine teeth, pointed tubercles on flanks, smooth face, extensively webbed outer toes, and a slender, elongated tubercle on eyelids. (See Wild (1997) for detailed osteology).\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n\nCountry distribution from: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nC. cornuta are widely distributed in terra firma and inundated rainforest areas in the Amazon Basin. They prefer the leaf-litter habitat associated with their cryptic coloration and burrowing habits (Duellman and Lizana 1994).\n\nLife History, Abundance, Activity, and Special Behaviors\nDuellman and Lizana (1994) estimated an average abundance of 1.9/ha in an Amazonian Peruvian site. Adult activity is mostly nocturnal, while juveniles were found to be active during both day and night. C. cornuta burrows the posterior end of its body with lateral movements of the hind legs and rear part of the body, maintaining its cryptically colored head above the leaf-litter. This species are avid feeders, employing a sit-and-wait ambush tactic on leaf-litter dwelling arthropods (mostly ants and beetles), and large prey (other frogs, small reptiles, and small mammals). Stomach content analysis found that large prey could account to more than half the volumetric content of an adult's diet (Duellman and Lizana 1994).\n\nLimited field observations have been made of C. cornuta breeding behavior. Breeding seems to occur after heavy rainfall, especially at the start of the rainy season (around November). Males call with a loud \"baaaaa.\" The tadpoles have a bluntly rounded snout, eyes in a dorsolateral position, a sinistral ventrolateral spiracle with an ovoid opening facing posteriorly. The mouth parts are highly keratinized, with several rows of teeth and a beak. The larvae have tan colored bodies with a greenish yellow belly and a tan colored translucent tail. Like their adult counterparts, the larvae are voracious carnivores. Their diet consists mainly of other tadpoles (Duellman and Lizana 1994).\n\nTrends and Threats\nC. cornuta has the widest distribution within the Ceratophrys genus and is not classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.\n\nRelation to Humans\nKnown commercially as horned frogs or pac-man frogs, ceratophryids are popular in the pet trade due to their atypical gapes and voracious appetites. However, C. cornuta is a less common pet than C. ornata and C. cranwelli.\n\nPossible reasons for amphibian decline\n\n    General habitat alteration and loss\n\nReferences\n \n\nLynch, J.D. (1982).

In the future, after a Third World War has decimated much of the Earth's population, a new nation known as Libria rises up under the unquestioned leadership of Dupont (Angus MacFadyen). Believing human emotions and their expression were to blame for the failings of past societies, The Father has decreed that all citizens must take a daily dose of Prozia II, a drug which levels out the emotional landscape, and that all forms of creative expression are against the law; violating either regulation can be punished by death. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton, an elite law enforcement officer who tracks down and punishes \"sense offenders.\" One day, Preston accidentally fails to take his Prozia II, and for the first time begins experiencing emotions himself. Preston becomes aware of an underground of rebels who refuse to take their medication and have embraced art and literature, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with one of their number, Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson). Equilibrium is the second feature-length directorial effort from Kurt Wimmer, whose screenwriting credits include The Thomas Crown Affair and Sphere.\n\nequilibrium,\"equilibrium clip\",\"equilibrium trailer\",\"equilibrium fight scene\",\"christian bale\",\"angus macfadyen\",\"kurt wimmer\",\"gun videos\",\"machine gun videos\",\"polygraph videos\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi dramas\",\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"andrew rona\",\"lucas foster\",\"sue baden-powell\",\"jan de bont\",\"ninon tantet\",\"revenge videos\",\"violence videos\",\"john preston\",dupont,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++259842,/m/01wy5m,/m/04nr37", "title": "Equilibrium (10/12) Movie CLIP - Not Without Incident (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-10T07:03:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4wefiJj2k0I", "description": "Click here: http://gettingyourexback.com and download the FREE report.\n\nWhen it comes to how to get your ex boyfriend back, there are a lot of very complicated - but very necessary -- tools and strategies that you will need to employ.

The average male lasts 5-10 minutes, which usually isn't enough time for the female to enjoy a complete orgasm. If you want to last longer in bed, then you have to care about getting better at it.\nSee, there's a lot of things that we care about. We care about education, sports, careers, activities, and so on. If we didn't put any effort in practicing them or even more importantly caring about them, then we wouldn't be good at any of it.\nSex is an activity that a lot of people view in terms of pleasing one's self and that's it. At first it's an exciting form of art that we feel is important, but after a while it's not as exciting and we use it as a quick activity to relieve our desire.\nGetting better at sex and lasting longer is really quite simple. Just like anything else, the secret is taking it a little more seriously and simply practicing it.\n5 Ways to Last Longer in Bed\n1. Kegel exercises. These exercises help to tighten muscles that are responsible for ejaculatory control. The more you work these muscles out the more control you have in how soon you ejaculate. This also helps for erectile dysfunction, going to the bathroom too often. To do these exercises you first have to find the muscle. Next time you pee, try stopping mid flow. That flexing you used to stop peeing, is the same flexing you need to practice. Flex the muscle daily. Flex the muscle for 5 seconds and release. Do this for 10 minutes a day, and it will do you wonders.\n\n2. Stop Masturbating with the purpose of releasing as quickly as possible. When you masturbate, try lasting up to 15 minutes before ejaculating. It's more difficult than you think. When masturbating have the woman's orgasm in mind, not your own. This will help you focus on the more important thing, which is pleasing the woman, and it will help you keep your mind off ejaculating.\n\n3. Don't think of having an orgasm during sex. When you think of finishing, that's exactly what will happen. Focus on something else like pleasing your partner. Focus on her curves, her body, and what's going on at the moment.\n\n4. Foreplay for much longer. Focusing on foreplay helps to keep you cool and in control of your excitement. When you're overly excited, there's a much higher chance of you bursting. Not only will you be able to control how excited you are when you're going to perform sex, but she'll also be 10x more stimulated and have a much better orgasm.\n\n5. Stop and go. During sex, if you feel you're becoming too aroused, stop for 5-10 seconds and let the excitement subside. Instead of thrusting try pressing. The difference is that when you thrust you have a burst of blood flow and your excitement increases much faster. It's better to avoid this until the end when either you or she's ready to climax.\n\n\n\n\nKegel Exercise,\nLast Longer In Bed,\n\n\nHow To Increase Stamina,\nPenis Exercises,\nHow To Stop Premature Ejaculation,\nDelayed Ejaculation,\nMale Ejaculation,\n\nHow To Last Longer During Sex,\nPremature Ejaculation Treatment,\nHow To Delay Ejaculation,\nHow To Last Longer In Bed For Men,\nHow To Prevent Premature Ejaculation,", "title": "How To Delay Ejaculation & How Can A Man Last Longer In Bed", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T10:20:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4wj_DK88D8A", "description": "View full story at http://news.kron4.com", "title": "social worker molester", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T03:08:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4wjkeT05UFM", "description": "We have hit over 121,000 Viewers !

Anacondas may not be as big as they are in Hollywood movies, but they are considered the the largest snake in the world judging by weight. They can grow up to 25 feet in length and weigh over 500 pounds. \n\nEunectes murinus\n________________________________________________\n\nCARLO BANFI WEBSITE LINKS\n\nhttp://www.banfi.ch/  \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/franco.banfi.37%3Cbr%20/\n\nhttp://blog.banfi.ch/\n\nhttp://cpn.canon-europe.com/content/ambassadors/explorers/franco_banfi.do\n___________________________________________________________\n\nThe Anaconda is a constrictor, it kills it prey by coiling itself around the victim and squeezing. The crushing power is equal to placing a school bus on a human chest. Because it is so big, the Anaconda can eat large prey like deer, sheep, dogs, and occasionally jaguars and humans. \n\nSeeing one of these snakes from a boat can be scary enough. But can you image swimming in the water with one?  That's what Swiss Photographer Fanco Banfi did, to get some pictures. \n\nBanfi: I was already in the water and suddenly I come across this really big Anaconda. It was around 5 or 6 Meters and looked like it weighed more than 250  Kilos\n\nFranco didn't do much research before taking a chance with his life to get this picture, but Franco was in less danger than you might think. \n\nAccording to Snake Experts, Anacondas are ambush predators and usually only attack prey on land. They hunt by staying submerged at the water's edge - waiting for prey to come close.  They rarely attack in the water. \n\nIn all Franco spent ten days photographing Anacondas in Brazil and encountered no less than 6 female anacondas...Some people call Franco brave for what he did, others say he is crazy.

Although the name actually applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda, Eunectes murinus, which is one of the largest snakes in the world.\n\nVarious theories exist regarding the origin of the name itself. The most widely accepted one suggests it was derived from the Sinhala henakandaya since the phonetic sounds are very similar. However, this name is used to refer to the brown vine snake, Ahaetulla pulverulenta, a slender, arboreal species that grows to five feet (152 cm) at most and feeds only on small vertebrates.[2] Another theory by Yule and Burnell (1886) is based on an entry in the Catalogue of Indian Serpents from the Leyden Museum (Ray, 1693) that reads: Anacondaia Zeylonensibus, id est Bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens, meaning \"the anacondaia of the Ceylonese, i.e. he that crushes the limbs of buffaloes and yoke beasts.\" Without a clear Sinhala connection, they suggest one from the Tamil language instead: anai-kondra (anaik-konda), meaning \"which killed an elephant.\"Per National Geographic, the word anaconda comes from the Tamil word anaikolra, which means elephant killer.\n\nThe name was first used in the English language in 1768 by V. Jonasson in a colorful description of a large snake found in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), most likely a reticulated python, Python reticulatus. The account, which explains how the snake crushes and devours tigers, is full of popular misconceptions, but was much read at the time, and so gave rise to the myth of the anaconda of Ceylon.", "title": "ANACONDA vs DIVER - Amazon River Monsters", "publishedDate": "2013-02-22T20:00:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xH1-x3ivPw", "description": "Locksmith Honda Integra Type R unlock door replacement keys car emergency locksmith new lock installation high security locks iron gates works re key cutting locked 24 hour Auto Lock Picking Car Course", "title": "Locksmith Unlock A Car Door Honda Integra Type R", "publishedDate": "2011-10-19T17:11:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xHAxOPKJ5U", "description": "The Plank Pose in 'Mickey Mehta's Super Sacred Sexercise' DVD is one of the session that will make you sexually confident and to integrate your totality to the core.\nThis DVD has other routines and workouts for couples that will enhance the bonding, romance, intimacy to maximize the celebration of life and to have a fulfilling legitimate sex life.\nDVD available on www.timesmusic.com", "title": "Mickey Mehta's Super Sacred Sexercise Plank Pose", "publishedDate": "2014-01-10T10:50:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xHTuTD6x1g", "description": "dan_maghiari@yahoo.com", "title": "Otto Pascal - Printr-un gest (official video)", "publishedDate": "2014-01-19T14:21:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xHrCkAkygo", "description": "Amy doing new things :) So proud of her!\nNot just a bril cart horsey :)", "title": "Cart horse?", "publishedDate": "2013-09-09T06:54:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xHr_MdMGsQ", "description": "http://agronotizie.imagelinenetwork.com/difesa-e-diserbo/2012/03/01/agrofarmaci-le-novitagrave-2012-le-relazioni-i-video-le-foto-14986.cfm - Reportage dell'evento dedicato ai nuovi agrofarmaci.

While it can be difficult to shrug it off as just an extra piece of skin, this is pretty much exactly what it is. Skin tags are, for all intents and purposes, benign tumors that find their way onto different parts of a human being's body.\n\nThey are simply representative of excessive skin cell growth in one particular area and are not representative of any serious disease or health concern. However, they can be very aesthetically unpleasing to look at. There are various ways that a person can have a skin tag removed without dealing with a lot of pain and discomfort.\nHow to Get Rid of Skin Tags\nIn terms of the ease of removal, there is no better way to remove a skin tag than to cut it off with either a pair of scissors or a fingernail clipper. You want to make sure to get as close to the healthy skin as possible without damaging it. The tag should come off relatively easily, as it is simply attached by another thin piece of skin. You want to make sure, however, that the utensils used in the removal process are thoroughly sterilized.\nHow to Get Rid of Skin Tags\nDoing so ensures that infections will not become an issue if there is an open wound where the skin tag used to be. Taking the tags off in this manner has also been known to be painful, so icing down the area prior to removal is always a good idea to reduce the initial amount of pain endured.\n\nYou can also use the technique of freezing your skin tags off with liquid nitrogen. This type of procedure is usually utilized to remove warts on a person's body and can be very effective when used to get rid of these unsightly blemishes.\nHow to Get Rid of Skin Tags\nThis method is not usually associated with much in the way of pain, so it is a preferred method of those not willing to risk the discomfort of other removal methods. It should be noted that using liquid nitrogen can be very harmful to the skin if it is applied too frequently. Sticking with an application once or twice per week should be sufficient enough to remove the tag from the skin.\n\nOther methods such as cutting off the blood supply to the growth or having a dermatologist remove them are also available to those who are not comfortable removing them. Great caution needs to be taken whatever route you decide to go in because skin tags can be easily irritated and cause a great deal of discomfort if prolonged rubbing or picking of the tag occurs. By whatever means you choose to get one removed, skin tags should not be looked at as dangerous bodily growths that could ultimately lead to problems down the line.

Named after the French word passager for \"passing by\", it was once the most abundant bird in North America, and possibly the world. It accounted for more than a quarter of all birds in North America. The species lived in enormous migratory flocks until the early 20th century, when hunting and habitat destruction led to its demise. One flock in 1866 in southern Ontario was described as being 1 mi (1.5 km) wide and 300 mi (500 km) long, took 14 hours to pass, and held in excess of 3.5 billion birds. That number, if accurate, would likely represent a large fraction of the entire population at the time.\n\nIntro/Outro music:\nDiscovery Hit/Chucky the Construction Worker - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under CC-BY-3.0\n\nText derived from:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\n\nText to Speech powered by voice-rss.com\n\nImages are Public Domain or CC-BY-3.0:\nMershon's_The_Passenger_Pigeon_(frontispiece,_crop).jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\n\nPassenger_pigeon_shoot.png from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\n\nPassenger_Pigeon_Net_Cockburn_1829.jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\n\nMershon's_The_Passenger_Pigeon_(Audubon_plate,_crop).jpg from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\n\nROM-BirdGallery-PassengerPigeon.png from http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopistes_migratorius", "title": "All About - Passenger pigeon", "publishedDate": "2014-11-06T04:12:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xUUKxZPzPY", "description": "http://www.pocketknivesblog.com Watch me give the Great Eastern Cutlery UN-X-LD Workhorse Whittler a workout!\n\nNEW Ebook about Colonial Knife Company:\nMY FAMILY BUSINESS - Colonial Knife Company by Robert Paolantonio: https://gumroad.com/l/ZLDb", "title": "GEC Workhorse Whittler Burnt Stag Cutting Deomonstration", "publishedDate": "2012-06-27T20:51:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xUnKKOY2m4", "description": "Sorry about some series being stalled because of this whole situation!", "title": "SPRINKLES LOST ITS MEMBERSHIP?!", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T21:16:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xUo46LOagw", "description": "The #1 Secret to Clear Skin Revealed:\nClick Here: http://www.acnesoldier.com/vip/season-1/\n\nAsk Me Your Acne Questions:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/acnesoldier\n\nFor the most part, all 2.5% benzoyl peroxide acne products pretty much do the same thing.

It was here (1959) that Mary and Louis Leakey discovered the remains of Nutcracker Man. Nearby, in Laitoli, (1979) Mary Leakey discovered the footprints of hominids which are estimated to be over three million years old. Shifting Sands: There is the volcanic ash dune of Shifting Sands situated near Olduvai Gorge. These crescent-shaped mounds are a remarkable phenomenon. Technically they are known as barkan, and they result if there is sufficient dust on the ground and a unidirectional wind to blow it. The dust collects around a stone, and this collection accumulates more. The process continues, with the mound growing all the time, and then it begins to move. The crescents have their two sharp arms pointing the way the wind is going, and the whole shape is beautifully symmetrical", "title": "African Safari 4 - Olduvai (Oldupai) Gorge & Shifting Sands Ngorongoro", "publishedDate": "2012-04-17T20:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xblW97jo8w", "description": "Click link to see more photos, school, area information and more: http://www.searchallproperties.com/virtualtour/1585765/17-Wildwood-Street-Winchester-MA\n\n17 Wildwood Street\nWinchester, MA 01890\n\nContact Sven Andersen for more information.\nRemax The Andersen Team\n781-625-4249\n\nFrom the moment you enter the foyer of this 1920&amp;rsquo;s colonial you will be charmed by the original gumwood wainscoting and gleaming hardwood flooring throughout.

Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it. The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as 24 inches (60 cm) long and 8 inches (20 cm) wide. While most casts have five toes \u2014 like all known apes \u2014 some casts of alleged Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six.Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.Proponents claim that Bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "Wonderful Decoration And Lighting Inside The Puja Pandal", "publishedDate": "2013-10-26T16:24:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xeMWqFfmlE", "description": "Located in Phoenix, Arizona, Chromosomal Laboratories is one of North America's leading accredited DNA testing facilities specializing in forensics, paternity and immigration testing services.", "title": "Chromosomal Laboratories.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-08-26T21:28:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4xe_8YTsIwk", "description": "microcytic hypochromic-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .
