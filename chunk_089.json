The nucleus (RFP-NLS, red) periodically accelerates away from the trailing edge of the cell (outlined by GFP-MLC2, green) during migration through 3D CDM (Video 1 of 10.1126/science.1256965).\n\n- Penn-NIH Team Discovers New Type of Cell Movement in 3D Matrix\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-nih-team-discover-new-type-cell-movement-3d-matrix\n\nReferences\n1. Many modes of motility\nScience 29 August 2014: Vol. 345 no. 6200 pp. 1002-1003 DOI: 10.1126/science.1259176\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1002.summary\n\nDirected cell migration in multicellular organisms is essential to fundamental processes including embryogenesis, defense from infection, and tissue repair and regeneration. It is also key in cancer progression as metastatic cells disseminate throughout the body. Much research has focused on cells migrating on two-dimensional (2D) extracellular matrices (ECMs) because such experimental systems are easily accessible and observable. However, recent studies of cell motility in 3D environments are challenging the ubiquity and generality of 2D-based models. On page 1062 of this issue, Petrie et al. (1) propose that in a constrained 3D space, a cell can use its nucleus as a piston to polarize internal pressure and create protrusions that facilitate movement.\n\n2. Generation of compartmentalized pressure by a nuclear piston governs cell motility in a 3D matrix\nScience 29 August 2014: Vol. 345 no. 6200 pp. 1062-1065 DOI: 10.1126/science.1256965\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1062\n\nEditor's Summary\nPush me, pull you, that's the way to move\nPrimary cells, derived directly from human tissue, exhibit different behaviors in shape and signaling within three-dimensional (3D) or 2D spaces. When the pressure within the cell increases, cells display limb-like bumps, which they use to move through their 3D environment. Petrie et al. now show that when the complex of actin and myosin contracts, it controls the pressure within cells and therefore the shape of those protruding structures (see the Perspective by DeSimone and Horwitz). The authors measured internal pressures in migrating mammalian cells. In the 3D matrix, those cells have higher pressure that differs between the front and back of the cell, which creates a piston effect. Science, this issue p. 1062 (2); see also p. 1002 (1)\n\nAbstract \nCells use actomyosin contractility to move through three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrices. Contractility affects the type of protrusions cells use to migrate in 3D, but the mechanisms are unclear. In this work, we found that contractility generated high-pressure lobopodial protrusions in human cells migrating in a 3D matrix. In these cells, the nucleus physically divided the cytoplasm into forward and rear compartments. Actomyosin contractility with the nucleoskeleton-intermediate filament linker protein nesprin-3 pulled the nucleus forward and pressurized the front of the cell. Reducing expression of nesprin-3 decreased and equalized the intracellular pressure. Thus, the nucleus can act as a piston that physically compartmentalizes the cytoplasm and increases the hydrostatic pressure between the nucleus and the leading edge of the cell to drive lamellipodia-independent 3D cell migration.", "title": "Cell Migration (Movie 1)", "publishedDate": "2014-09-01T00:17:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_QVeu8FxQ4", "description": "Poker Rap Song\n\nJourney with a staller 10 people to go on the bubble in a major tournament.", "title": "Stall 101", "publishedDate": "2008-07-21T13:23:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_QWyxjk9WA", "description": "Written and Hosted by Laci Green: http://www.twitter.com/gogreen18\nBrought to you with love by: http://mtvother.com \nProduced by: http://www.kornhaberbrown.com\n\nTaylor's big in the news right now for 1989 (which is awesome), but she also made some pretty major statements recently about ladies.

Hosted by Ryan Seacrest, and featuring judges Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Lopez, and Keith Urban, along with in-house mentor Randy Jackson, the series empowers contestants and viewers to share their voices in deciding who will be America's next singing superstar. \n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of hopefuls from across the nation audition for a shot at stardom. The show's judges will travel across the country including stops in Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Boston, MA; Detroit, MI; Omaha, NE, Salt Lake City, UT; and San Francisco, CA, in search of the next AMERICAN IDOL. They narrow down the competitors to a select group of semifinalists who sing their hearts out each week in front of a studio audience and television viewers.\n \nThe judges have their say after every performance, but it's the viewing public that determines who will advance to become a finalist and who will go home. Telephone, text message and online voting begin immediately after each live performance show, and the results are announced during the following night's live broadcast. \n\nEventually the competition is whittled down to two finalists who compete for a major recording contract with 19 Recordings and the AMERICAN IDOL title. Past winners Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery Phillip Phillips, and Candice Glover, as well as fan-favorites Jennifer Hudson, Adam Lambert, Chris Daughtry, and Katharine McPhee, have all become household names and made their marks on the recording industry.\n\nNew York Can't Get Enough of JLo! - AMERICAN IDOL XIV\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/americanidol", "title": "New York Can't Get Enough of JLo! - AMERICAN IDOL XIV", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T19:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4_iihXzHPjw", "description": "Figs are back!

The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site covering parts of Khulna, Satkhira and Bagerhat District in southwestern Bangladesh.\n\nLocated in Bangladesh, the Sundarbans borders the Sundarbans National Park in the Indian state of West Bengal. Sundarbans is divided into three protected forests in Bangladesh namely Sundarbans South, East and West Wildlife Sanctuary. This region is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. There is much more wildlife here than just the endangered Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Most importantly, mangroves are a transition from the marine to freshwater and terrestrial systems, and provide critical habitat for numerous species of small fish, crabs, shrimps and other crustaceans that adapt to feed and shelter, and reproduce among the tangled mass of roots, known as pneumatophores, which grow upward from the anaerobic mud to get the supply of oxygen. Fishing Cats, Macaques, wild boars, Common Grey Mongooses, Foxes, Jungle Cats, Flying Foxes, Pangolins, and spotted deer are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans.\n \nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Last month we took a look at numbers 1 through 4 of the 16 most common mistakes made by Do-It-Yourself homeowners on St. Charles basement remodeling projects. Now let's take a look at numbers 5-8.\n5. Ignoring safety measures\nYou may not be fighting on the frontlines but you still need to take the proper safety measures when remodeling your basement. Hardhats, safety goggles and work gloves are must haves at the job site if you want to avoid injury and finish your St. Charles basement remodeling project safely.\n6. Forgetting fire blocking and draft stopping  measures\nThese are two critical tasks that will protect your home in the event of a fire and are often forgotten. Forgetting to fire block and draft stop can also cost you by having to tear out drywall should an inspector ask to see proof that you did these tasks.\n7. Inadequate supply and return air vents \nMany inexperienced Do-It-Yourself St. Charles basement remodelers are unaware of the fact that you need an adequate number of supply and return air vents. Not having the proper number can make for some very uncomfortable and chilly winters in your basement as an inadequate amount of heat will be ran into your basement from your furnace\n8. Forgetting to run combustion air venting \nThis is an important aspect and should not be overlooked. A combustion air vent is important to install in order to supply adequate combustion air or make-up air to fired furnaces and water heaters.\nMarvelous Basements is a certified St. Charles basement remodeling contractor.

While Philae descends to the surface over a period of seven hours, Rosetta makes another manoeuvre to maintain visibility with the lander.

Because it was equipped with a Ballistic Recovery Systems (BRS) full-plane parachute system, the pilot survived uninjured. Immediately after the wing snapped off, the pilot activated the full-plane parachute system.  The 'chute is normally attached to the airframe such that it would bring the plane down on its gear. In this case, it does appear that the lines were wrapped around the rear fuselage as the aircraft spun, holding the aircraft nose down during the descent and landing. Look closely and you can see the tail surfaces moving as the aircraft descents under canopy. This may represent the pilot's effort to free the line, or it may indicate something else.\n\nComparing a ballistic 'chute to a normal parachute worn on the body in this case it seems the full-plane parachute was a good choice. Due to the rate of roll induced by the loss of one wing, it appears questionable that the pilot could have escaped the cockpit and saved himself wearing a conventional parachute on his back. Conventional parachutes are not aided by ballistic deployment and may require more altitude to properly open. Had the pilot been wearing a parachute and managed to escape the spinning aircraft without being hit by it, he have simply have impacted the ground under a partially opened canopy. In this case, full-plane parachute FTW.\n\nvideo by Glenn Pew\nhttp://www.glennpew.com\n\nfor http://www.avweb.com", "title": "Real Aircraft Loses Wing, Lands Safely (Under Canopy)", "publishedDate": "2010-08-17T06:10:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4a8g15k2lJY", "description": "Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy with Autonomy L-Hook and Clip Applier by Dr. Doug Dahl, MD at Massachusetts General Hospital\n\nhttp://www.cambridgeendo.com", "title": "Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy using Autonomy articulating L-Hook and Clip Applier - short", "publishedDate": "2013-09-27T19:29:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4a9-FMXTkR0", "description": "Learn how to say aerator correctly with our pronounciation tutorials", "title": "How to pronounce aerator", "publishedDate": "2014-07-03T09:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4a9AzQmqGyc", "description": "Here's former UFC middle champion and MMA legend Anderson \"The Spider\" Silva receiving a warm welcome from Dana White and Conor McGregor at UFC 179 in Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 26, 2014.", "title": "Dana White, Conor McGregor, Anderson Silva greeting at UFC 179", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T02:44:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4a9H-xYkes0", "description": "Preview of Graybeard's blog at TravelPod.

Evans, Stephen King\nFilm Description: Based on the Stephen King short story The Body, Rob Reiner's easygoing nostalgia piece is set in Castle Rock, OR, over Labor Day weekend, 1959. A quartet of boys, inseparable friends all, set out in search of a dead body that one of the boys overhears his brother talking about. The foursome consists of intellectual Gordie (Wil Wheaton), born leader Chris (River Phoenix), emotionally disturbed Teddy (Corey Feldman), and chubby hanger-on Vern (Jerry O'Connell). The boys' adventures en route to the elusive body are colored by the personal pressures brought to bear on all of them by the adult world. Richard Dreyfuss, playing the grown-up Gordie, narrates the film, while Kiefer Sutherland dominates every scene he's in as a brutish high-school bully.\n\n\"stand by me\",\"stand by me clip\",\"stand by me ben e king\",\"stand by me prince royce\",\"kiefer sutherland\",\"corey feldman\",\"river phoenix\",\"casey siemaszko\",\"jerry oconnell\",\"wil wheaton\",\"gary riley\",\"bradley gregg\",\"jason oliver\",\"rob reiner\",\"knife videos\",\"pistol videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",\"andrew scheinman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++46439,/m/0mdyn,/m/08hjdd,/m/01nglk,/m/015076,/m/06t2mw,/m/06nts3,/m/01rzqj,/m/0l_dv", "title": "You're Not Taking Him - Stand by Me (7/8) Movie CLIP (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-05T21:11:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aIwhR3Zfo0", "description": "A few spliced clips from the Ptomaine ( terminal ) 2002or3", "title": "MONO PAUSE @ Terminal", "publishedDate": "2006-06-05T03:45:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aJ2a1MP3nY", "description": "This is\nVIDEO 54\nI am back with more Dragon Ball  Toys\nand\nI am here to share my Dragon Ball Collection to the world !!!\nin this video is about =\nwow this is for all you pervs OUT there LOL joke\n\n\nDRAGON BALL : Super DX \nKame Sennin a.k.a\n(Master Roshi)\n Tissue Soft Cover\nBY BANPRESTO\n\n( honest this Tissue Cover was disappointment by Banpresto , what !!!!! where they  thinking  ???\nokay what do you think about this tissue cover is epic or not \nlet me know \nwrite me a comment\nthanks ) \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this video and stay tuned for the next video coming up soon, of more Dragon Ball Toys", "title": "DRAGON BALL Super DX  Kame Sennin  (Master Roshi) Tissue Soft Cover BY BANPRESTO", "publishedDate": "2010-04-10T07:56:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aJG-EpEsys", "description": "Somatic Responses - Catecholamines\nPuny God LP (2013)", "title": "Somatic Responses - Catecholamines", "publishedDate": "2013-01-22T19:52:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aJ_P0LiZv0", "description": "This video was taken on the Fairbanks Riverboat Discovery cruise overlooking Sun Butcher's kennels.

The calls are heard at 4, 11 and 22 seconds into the recording.\n\nGrey whale calls are uncommonly recorded on our observatories, as these whales rarely vocalize outside of their breeding lagoons.\n\nGrey whales grow over 14 m long and can weigh up to 30,000 kg. The light and dark grey patterns on their bodies are unique to each individual. Scientists use these patterns and the spacing of the cartilaginous \"knuckles\" along their lower spines to identify individuals. Their skin is covered with whale lice and a species of whale barnacle that exists only on grey whales. \n\nThere are two populations of grey whales, one in the Eastern North Pacific Ocean, and a smaller population in the Western North Pacific Ocean (Atlantic grey whales were hunted to extinction in the 18th century). Eastern grey whales have the longest migration of any mammal, migrating up to 9,000 km each way between their feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and Alaska and their breeding grounds in Baja, California and Mexico. Like humpback whales, grey whales do not eat in the winter, living off of their fat stores during this time.\n\nGrey whales are the only baleen whale species that eats primarily bottom-dwelling organisms. They feed by rolling onto their sides and sucking mud into their mouths and filtering out small crustaceans and fishes with their baleen. Like humans, grey whales exhibit laterality, or \"handedness.\" Individual whales will typically feed on the same side every time, and have associated scratches and fewer barnacles on the side that goes through the mud.\n\nGrey whales can live as long as 70 years. They are still hunted by humans through aboriginal subsistence hunting, and Bigg's orcas frequently attack their calves. Non-predatory threats include increased human activity in their breeding lagoons, entanglement in fishing gear, ship collisions and toxic spills from marine oil exploration and drilling.", "title": "Three More Grey Whale Calls", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T20:42:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4a_vh2mWNjw", "description": "", "title": "College Algebra - Section 5.4 - Video 6 - Graphing a transformed Logarithm", "publishedDate": "2011-03-26T03:11:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aaC6wM8dHI", "description": "video musical de rbd celestial", "title": "RBD Celestial", "publishedDate": "2010-03-02T20:43:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aaD_hnx0Qc", "description": "The crowd at Camlachie sing Glory Glory, or Bannerman!", "title": "Crowd sing Glory Glory at Camlachie Band Hall", "publishedDate": "2013-04-14T21:43:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aaF1HC0IKE", "description": "Music video by Scoundrels performing Gulf of Mexico.

However the single success has given the doctors hope. \n\nTheir desire is to eventually develop their current trials and methods into a single-shot cure.", "title": "Massive dose of measles vaccine clears woman's incurable cancer", "publishedDate": "2014-05-16T12:02:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "4agRuyMxF2g", "description": "Avril 2009, Paris, pour pr\u00e9parer la diffusion de D\u00e9rivatifs \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de curiosit\u00e9s, le 4 Juillet 2009.

When the elder Thaddeus Gropius confronts Wally with the boilerplate plot ultimatum that he must marry the saddest girl in the world or be disinherited, a yarn unravels that is part screwball comedy and part unhinged parable on the lucrativeness of changing your identity.\n\nHensleys dialogue is witty, lyrical, sampled, dada, and elliptical \u2014 all in the service of a very bizarre mystery. Theres sex, violence, rock and roll, intrigue, and betrayal \u2014 all brought home in Hensleys truly inimitable style. Created during an era when another well-off W was stuffing the coffers of the morbidly solvent, Wally Gropius transforms futile daydreams and nightmares into the absurdity of capital.\n\nOriginally serialized in Fantagraphics' house anthology Mome, the story is presented here in a larger format with additional, previously unseen material.\n\nOne of my favorite graphic novels of all time. Hilarious and utterly unique, Wally Gropius is a work of unassuming genius that rewards on ever-deepening levels with each rereading. \u2014 Daniel Clowes", "title": "Wally Gropius by Tim Hensley - video preview", "publishedDate": "2010-04-21T07:40:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4atF_B5UcFA", "description": "Watch more How to Understand Alcoholism videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/517377-Can-Alcoholics-Learn-to-Drink-Moderately-Alcoholism\n\nLearn about alternative treatments for alcoholism in this Howcast video featuring addictions specialist Paul J.

In the prologue Duchamp appears on a reddish cosmos background, in a double-reflection version, male and female (let us recall Duchamps female identity, Rose S\u00e9lavy created in New York in 1920, with which the artist signed various works). But death comes to kidnap the superior part of our double hero, and lets the other one drop down towards the earth. Just like in the Platonic myth, the Convito, the unity of the androgynous is broken and the fallen Marcel (or Rose) will have to complete ten different tasks inside a museum before he/she will be able to reunite with his/her other half and renew the universe in a cosmic conflagration. Inside the museum, the paintings and the sculpture (there is only one  Michelangelos David) our hero/heroine meets on his way come to life and threaten him/her.\nWhat if the destiny, not only of art, but of all of Western culture, had been decided between 726 and 787 A.D., i.e., between the destruction of sacred images ordered by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III Isaurico and the following council of Nicea, which, on the contrary, declared the lawfulness of their cult?\nImages continue to have a central role  even after the decline of the Christian religion as a crucial means of social cohesion  in the secularised and disenchanted society which has formed in the course of modernity. The victory of iconolatry between the VIII and IX Century of the vulgar era, in other words, could have marked the West in an irreversible way.\nThe only way to really come to terms with the art of our past is by freeing it from the ideological and habitual incrustations, which have transformed some masterpieces into common places of a diffuse and banal culture.\nConcept and Design: Lorenzo Pizzanelli\nDirectors: Fariba Ferdosi and Lorenzo Pizzanelli", "title": "Iconoclast Game ENG 12 VAN GOGH", "publishedDate": "2009-07-13T22:28:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4avxvONZZI8", "description": "Newsreel", "title": "Callas 1958 Rome Walkout", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T20:02:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4aw4yQSNxxE", "description": "Compre com desconto na Kanui http://kanui.me/lafenix10\n\nCURTA e FAVORITE esse v\u00eddeo, isso ajuda muito a gente!\nConfira a batalha pok\u00e9mon Squirtle vs Charmander da vida real.

Period.  Why was it overlooked by the general record-buying public? Why has it not yet even been reissued on compact disc? Good questions - considering the overall excellence of the production, and Brenda's extraordinary vocals. I am going to quote directly from Brenda Lee's autobiography \"Little Miss Dynamite\" concerning this wonderful recording:\n\"Memphis was hot and producer Chips Moman was \"happening.\" Those musicians were making records that were hotter than firecrackers. I was a little bit more excited about the Memphis sessions than I had been about New York (\"Johnny One Time\"). I'd loved r&b since I was a kid. Plus, those musicians were good ol' boys, like the Nashville players, with a laid back attitude but incredible musicianship. \nThe album that resulted was called \"Memphis Portrait\".  I still like that record, but it was a bit of a departure. It was composed about half-and-half of hit Memphis soul tunes and newly written songs. I remember that we lived in that studio, recording around the clock for about a week. We practically slept there. We had food catered in, and we had plenty of good times. It was exhausting, but it was fun. \nToo bad it was all for naught. It turned out that 1969's \"Johnny One Time\" was my swan song as a pop hit maker - the Memphis single \"I Think I Love You Again\" failed to duplicate its success. In fact, the track stalled way down at No. 97 on Billboard's \"Hot 100\" chart. But I kept plugging away. I promoted \"Memphis Portrait\" by performing \"Proud Mary\" on Johnny Cash's national TV series. I poured my heart into it. Looking at that clip today, man, I was really rocking. But as good as it was, my \"soul\" LP was a commercial failure.  That was it. I told the record company, \"I'm tired of all this experimentation. I want to go back to where I belong.  I want to go back with Owen\".  So that's what I did. I returned to Nashville (and) reunited with Owen Bradley.\"  Produced by Chips Moman - recorded at American Recording Studios in Memphis TN.\n\nUploaded with Free Video Converter from Freemake\nhttp://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/", "title": "Brenda Lee - Do Right Woman Do Right Man", "publishedDate": "2014-02-23T18:41:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4b4Hdi0dj4k", "description": "Though there are disturbing developments on the foreign front, let's give thanks to the Lord for answered prayer in the last year.

Remove from the faucet and fill the other half with air. Tie it off.\n\nStep 2: Hold balloon over candle\nLight a candle. Hold the balloon at the knot end and dangle it above the flame, so the tip of the flame touches it. After 15 to 30 seconds, the smoke from the candle will collect as soot on the balloon's surface.\n\nStep 3: Collect the soot from the balloon\nUsing the brush, collect some of the carbon soot from the balloon. \n\nStep 4: Brush the soot onto the fingerprint\nBrush the area you want to search for fingerprints, coating it lightly with soot. If you need more soot, hold the balloon over the flame again until you get enough soot to dust with. \n\nTip\nThe smoother the surface, the better the fingerprinting results will be.\n\nStep 5: Identify a fingerprint\nLook for the patterns and swirls that identify a fingerprint. The oils in the print will make more of the carbon stick than the areas directly around it. \n\nStep 6: Collect the fingerprint\nOnce you've located a print and it's covered in soot, place a piece of clear tape over it. When you remove the tape, the fingerprint will be stuck to it! \n\nDid You Know?\nAbout 40,000 fingerprints are added to the FBI's database every day.", "title": "How to Dust for Fingerprints", "publishedDate": "2009-06-24T15:47:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bBVq4i16Wo", "description": "", "title": "Jawless Dog _ Jenna Green Audition 2", "publishedDate": "2013-11-04T02:24:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bBd00alGCE", "description": "Chi ti\u1ebft:http://coenzymeq10.vn/loi-ich-cua-coenzyme-q10/ .

Subscribe to the channel and tune in to Cube TV! http://www.cubic.com/Cube-TV \n---\nTranscript:\n\n(0:07) Adult learners, we don't like to learn things that we don't really see any value in. Everybody goes through this at their jobs, where they get dragged into some sort of training course and they don't understand it, they don't know why, and they pretty much sleep through it!\n\n(0:21) What's really important is that we embed the realism into the environment, into the training system itself so that people understand why they are there, they understand that there is value, that there is application of what they are learning. \n\n(0:33) We are able to duplicate a very highly immersive training environment for the trainee, so that they can blend all the knowledge that they've gained by memorizing the tasks at hand and being able to replicate those inside synthetic environment. It's an outstanding way to be able to take both the important memory requirements that are necessary as for adults to learn and to couple those with the ability to experience the learning. Studies have shown for years that experiential learning actually for adults produces a higher outcome of retention.\n\n(1:05) Game based training is the application of gaming technologies, to the problem of learning systems. You're going to have sort of an augmented reality where there will be little pop-up buttons, video, color and sound that will come through the gaming environment and it will be matched to cognitive science to say \"this is going to help you remember this thing.\"\n\n(1:24) When you're training inside of a synthetic environment, it's important that you're able to have the same types of feedback that you would when you're training one-on-one with a mentor. Our course-ware creates a synthetic, artificial intelligent mentor avatar that looks real and he acts independent of your thoughts, helping guide you through a particular task. \n\n(1:42) Avatar: \"In a few moments, I'll be taking you down to the jet drive room. There, we'll explain to you the tasks that need to be done on location. Then you will practice performing those tasks under guidance.\"\n\n(1:52) We use cutting edge technology to make sure that the avatars features and eye contact is highly engaged with the individual. \n\n(1:59) Sound technician: \"Alright, go!\"\n\nVoice over artist: \"We approach training in an innovative way, our approach ensures that by the end of the training, you will be able to immediately recognize your watch stations, reflexively perform required tasks, and demonstrate problem solving skills critical during normal and abnormal operations.\"\n\nSound technician: \"okay, let's do another take on that one.\"\n\n(2:18) We're beginning to see haptic devices tied into the game. The feedback then from what you're doing goes back directly into the game. That's huge because now we're engaging all the senses and that's crucial because that's what builds the muscle memory. \n(2:32) The nice thing about doing this virtually is that it can be standardized. Game based environments are tremendously cost effective and they allow people to repeat and repeat and repeat, until they get it right. That's really important, especially in environments where a second of hesitation really makes the difference between life and death. \n\n(2:50) There's tremendous opportunity to use narrative, story, fidelity and immersive environments just to motivate people, to motivate people to want to learn. Now we're creating an environment where it's all real, and they can test themselves and make sure that their skills are good enough so that when they get out there, they are really ready. \n---\nMusic Credit: \"Epic Virus\" by Sepgil - http://soundcloud.com/sepgil/epic-virus", "title": "Cubic Advanced Learning Solutions", "publishedDate": "2014-02-17T23:04:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bFUZrZweJw", "description": "", "title": "Vesper Town - Colour Wheel", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T00:35:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bFc1PKMRp8", "description": "", "title": "Pandora Pumpkin Pie Eater", "publishedDate": "2009-10-23T05:02:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bGBbrsnzbY", "description": "Payer \u00d6csi eml\u00e9k\u00e9re\nDalsz\u00f6veg:\nLent, az utc\u00e1nkban \u00e1ll egy kis b\u00e1r,\nminden \u00e9jjel egy f\u00e9rfi ott j\u00e1r.\n\u00c9s a zenekarnak pezsg\u0151t \u00edg\u00e9r:\n\"J\u00e1tsz\u00e1k el \u00fajra n\u00e9kem!\" Csak ennyit k\u00e9r...\n\nVisszaj\u00f6ssz hozz\u00e1m te m\u00e9g, ha j\u00f6n a ny\u00e1r,\nAmikor kiny\u00edlnak majd a viol\u00e1k.\nBetoppansz \u00fagy, mit r\u00e9gen,\nMint f\u00e9nysug\u00e1r az \u00e9jben, \u00e1t\u00f6lelsz n\u00e9m\u00e1n...\nNem k\u00e9rdek t\u0151led semmit, ki volt, ki t\u0151lem elvitt, nem v\u00e1dol a sz\u00e1m.\n\nEszedbe jut majd a kert, \u00e9s a sok vir\u00e1g,\nOtt, ahol el\u0151sz\u00f6r ny\u00edlt cs\u00f3kra a sz\u00e1d.\nMeg\u00e9rted akkor v\u00e9gre, amit \u00e9rzek,\nAmikor kiny\u00edlnak majd a viol\u00e1k!\n\nViszaj\u00f6ssz hozz\u00e1m te m\u00e9g, ha j\u00f6n a ny\u00e1r,\nAmikor kiny\u00edlnak majd a viol\u00e1k.\nS meg\u00e9rted akkor v\u00e9gre, amit \u00e9rzek,\nAmikor kiny\u00edlnak majd a viol\u00e1k!", "title": "Payer Andr\u00e1s-Mint a viol\u00e1k", "publishedDate": "2011-04-03T10:42:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bGRAyayA8c", "description": "Por primera vez, siguiendo criterios cient\u00edficos, se han reconstruido digitalmente los pasos de los que daban los dinosaurios.\nUn equipo de cient\u00edficos brit\u00e1nicos y argentinos dirigidos por el doctor William Irvin Seller ha recreado inform\u00e1ticamente el caminar del Argentinosaurus huinculensis, un dinosaurio de unos 40 metros de largo y 80 toneladas de peso. \nPara ello los investigadores han escaneado el esqueleto de uno de estos animales y lo han modelizado inform\u00e1ticamente con un computador que tiene una potencia de c\u00e1lculo equivalente a 30.000 ordenadores dom\u00e9sticos. \nLos resultados se pueden ver en este v\u00eddeo donde se recrea su capacidad para caminar y correr a diferentes velocidades de paso que van de 1 segundo (al principio del v\u00eddeo) a 4 segundos (al final).

When the 3 \"leaves home it drives\" to a new location, but it is still a value of 3, even if it's not in the first position anymore.   Same for the 4; it also drives to a new position in its little car...   and drives over to this new position.  Now it's first!  \n\nBut, that doesn't change the answer; 3 +4 = 7, and  4 + 3 = 7.  The difference, this is Commutative.  You'll notice, it's because the values commute, just like you might do in the morning, from home to school.\n\n Now, on the bottom, we have no changing colors, no changing numbers, because it's not the numbers that move or change!  What changes is \"with whom the friends choose to hang out\".   In this first value,  we'll say that 1 + 2, 1 and 2 are friends, and so they associate with each other, like friends do.\n\n In the second case, we'll say that 2 + 3 happen to be buddies,  so that 2 will hang out with 3 first when they go to play.  And, so they are associating with each other.\n\n In this first case, we see that 1 + 2 = 3,  plus the 3 we already had.   3 + 3 = 6.\n\n In the second case, we see that 2 + 3 = 5, bringing down the 1 we have not yet accompanied, we have 1 + 5; again 6.\n\nSo we have proven that no matter with which value the 2 associates first, the [sum] value will be coming to 6 either way.  This [is] the Associative Property, because of with whom the 2 associates.   \n\nThis is the Commutative Property because the values commute.\n\nThank you very much for today's lesson on Properties of Addition - Commutative  versus Associative.   \n\nNow I imagine the decorations make a little bit more sense!\n\nThank you.", "title": "Math: Properties of Addition; Commutative vs. Associative", "publishedDate": "2013-10-13T03:56:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "4bUQ9kNHg14", "description": "This video features Ottawa-based Bridgehead espresso coffee being used to pull a double espresso shot using a Breville BES860 (Barista Express).

Calvin also has another son but it is not Miranda child but will get to that later on. Violet has brought much drama into the family but that still never affected how Miranda and Calvin felt about each other. But, what if one day things start to go out wrong? Will the family drama stop? Or will they fix things together as a family.\n==\nI know short intro but trust me you'll find this story intersecting. I haven't done something like this before but I love Tyler Perry shows and movies and I taught why not and be the first to make one. This will be in the video so will see how that goes and if you haven't heard of this show before you must because it's very funny but sadly the show is almost coming to end but there still showing more new shows on Friday 9-10 pm airing on TBS (very funny). There are only two characters that I made up and that is the girl Violet and of course Grace who plays Arianna and of course Calvin and Miranda doesn't have girl but they do have a boy the only reason I use a girl because I wanted to do something a bit different. Oh and in case anybody ask no Cassi and LaVan aren't married they just have the same name I just found out today when I was researching them to see if my older cousin was right but she was wrong.

Every one of us used to work with different Non-governmental Organizations. We were brought together when Goethe Institute, invited us to participate in \"The concept of progress in different cultures 2005\" project and which has been applied in more than one country by more than one way.\nWe gathered many times to discuss the concept of progress and different related issues like: identity, human rights, scientific research, religion, politics, sports, the hindrance of development, awareness, and media. The diversity of opinions led to a vivid discussion which induced a variety od ideas. Then, we published a magazine that embraced our vision for progress as discussed in our meetings. However, we did not want that to be the end, so after we had came to a common vision, we wanted the issue to be of more potency. Hence, the idea of ADWAR was initiated, may such a simple dream play a role in changing reality.\n\nADWAR means that every one of us should have an effective role in this society; every one has an inner mysterious world of his own that is full of dreams which, if found its way to light, would have made life a better place. That is why our motto is \"Awareness-Participation-Creativity\". We hope that we can sweep the dust from our wasted energy via spreading awareness and activating the culture of positivness and participation, thus generating the chances for creativity and innovation.\n\nAIMS\n---------\n\n1. Broadening the circle of positive participation of youth and developing their skills like: the ability to the differences in thoughts and beliefs via exchanging different views.\n2. Forming and supporting similar youth groups, communicating with them and stimulating the roles in societies through (Awareness-Participation-Creativity).\n3. Ensuring the continuity of the activities of the group. The efficiency and the role of those avtivities should not be confined to the effectualness but to the endeavor of being an active and devveloped person in society.\n\nIMPORTANT PROJECTS BY ADWAR\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1. Training over the trainer for the ADWAR volunteers.\n2. The progress magazine as a result of Egypt progress project.\n3. The Arab League Simulation 2007 and 2008.\n4. Volunteer project 2008.\n5.

Similarly, his Petits po\u00e8mes en prose (1868; \"Little Prose Poems\") was the most successful and innovative early experiment in prose poetry of the time. Known for his highly contraversial, and often dark poetry, as well as his translation of the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, Baudelaire's life was filled with drama and strife, from financial disaster to being prosecuted for obscenity and blasphemy. Long after his death many look upon his name as representing depravity and vice: Others see him as being the poet of modern civilization, seeming to speak directly to the 20th century. \n\nKind Regards \n\nJim Clark \nAll rights are reserved on this video recording copyright Jim Clark 2009 \n\nLe Vampire\n\n\nToi qui, comme un coup de couteau,\nDans mon coeur plaintif es entr\u00e9e;\nToi qui, forte comme un troupeau\nDe d\u00e9mons, vins, folle et par\u00e9e,\n\n\nDe mon esprit humili\u00e9\nFaire ton lit et ton domaine;\n\u2014 Inf\u00e2me \u00e0 qui je suis li\u00e9\nComme le for\u00e7at \u00e0 la cha\u00eene,\n\n\nComme au jeu le joueur t\u00eatu,\nComme \u00e0 la bouteille l'ivrogne,\nComme aux vermines la charogne\n\u2014 Maudite, maudite sois-tu!\n\n\nJ'ai pri\u00e9 le glaive rapide\nDe conqu\u00e9rir ma libert\u00e9,\nEt j'ai dit au poison perfide\nDe secourir ma l\u00e2chet\u00e9.\n\n\nH\u00e9las! le poison et le glaive\nM'ont pris en d\u00e9dain et m'ont dit:\n\u00abTu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl\u00e8ve\n\u00c0 ton esclavage maudit,\n\n\nImb\u00e9cile! \u2014 de son empire\nSi nos efforts te d\u00e9livraient,\nTes baisers ressusciteraient\nLe cadavre de ton vampire!\n\nThe Vampire\n\n\nYou who, like the stab of a knife,\nEntered my plaintive heart;\nYou who, strong as a herd\nOf demons, came, ardent and adorned,\n\n\nTo make your bed and your domain\nOf my humiliated mind\n\u2014 Infamous bitch to whom I'm bound\nLike the convict to his chain,\n\n\nLike the stubborn gambler to the game, \nLike the drunkard to his wine, \nLike the maggots to the corpse,\n\u2014 Accurst, accurst be you!\n\n\nI begged the swift poniard \nTo gain for me my liberty, \nI asked perfidious poison \nTo give aid to my cowardice.\n\n\nAlas! both poison and the knife\nContemptuously said to me:\n\"You do not deserve to be freed\nFrom your accursed slavery,\n\n\nFool! \u2014 if from her domination\nOur efforts could deliver you,\nYour kisses would resuscitate\nThe cadaver of your vampire!\"\n\n\n\u2014 William Aggeler, The Flowers of Evil (Fresno, CA: Academy Library Guild, 1954)\n\n\n\n\nThe Vampire \n\nYou, who like a dagger ploughed \nInto my heart with deadly thrill: \nYou who, stronger than a crowd \nOf demons, mad, and dressed to kill,\n\n\nOf my dejected soul have made\nYour bed, your lodging, and domain:\nTo whom I'm linked (Unseemly jade!)\nAs is a convict to his chain,\n\n\nOr as the gamester to his dice, \nOr as the drunkard to his dram, \nOr as the carrion to its lice \u2014 \nI curse you.

The chalk liveforever is susceptible to aphid infestations.  The epicuticular wax is strange in that it is hydrophilic and will wrap around beads of water that come into contact with the rosettes, preventing evaporation.

Here's a recap.\n\nHeed resigned as solicitor general April 9, 2010, having learned police were investigating him for alleged election fraud, involving campaign flyers, during his hard-fought race last year. \n\nOn May 3, Terry Robertson, the independent special prosecutor appointed by the government to review the case cleared Heed, while charging three others connected to his campaign.\n\nThat exoneration was enough to persuade Premier Gordon Campbell to give heed his job back yesterday afternoon. \n\n\"It's good to be back in the saddle,\" Heed said.\n\nBut he didn't stay there long. Things got really weird about an hour after those comments were made, with a bombshell from Robertson.\n\nIt turns out, his law firm Harper Grey, donated $1000.00 to Kash Heed's election campaign.\n\nThe firm is a well-known Liberal financer, sending nearly $60,000.00 to the BC Liberal Party since 1996. \n\nIn a letter, Robertson said he knew about the money, and didnt think it put him in a conflict until May 3, almost four months after he took on the job. \n\nHe quit the case last night putting his exoneration of Heed under a cloud, and putting Heed under pressure to resign again.\n\nThis morning, he did.", "title": "Kash Heed Resigns Again", "publishedDate": "2010-05-06T05:32:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4cHFBIk_wJo", "description": "My entry to this great competition.

I immediately did not want to pass-on the opportunity and requested a beta-testing invite from Valve. Well, after weeks of waiting, my request was finally answered... two days just before Valve decided to release Source Filmmaker en-masse to the public. Bleh. @_@\n\nAnyway, this animation itself took me over a month to complete. This is my first SFM animation I worked on, so go easy on me. Animation is based on an idea for a TF2 comic I had back in 2011, which I never got around to actually drawing it. So when Source Filmmaker was released, I thought, hey, let's turn this into an animation instead! So that's what I did.\n\nI used only the motion editor for the entire animation. (I never even touched the graph editor at all!) Even the camera motions as well. It was indeed as difficult as it sounds, but it allowed me to produce more realistic motions compared to keyframe-based animation.\n\nI rendered the whole thing using 64x depth of field, 64x motion blur and with ambient occlusion turned on. It took 5 hours to render, and then with an additional 5 hours rerendering everything all over again because of the need to fix just one mistake in a scene which for some reason I'm unable to ignore.", "title": "[SFM] The Curse of Team Auto-Balance", "publishedDate": "2012-08-11T06:06:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4cHuM8m10jw", "description": "Les parcs de contention fixes MAZERON sont con\u00e7us pour trier, effectuer des traitements ou des soins, peser, etc...

The seeds should germinate by late spring; giving us new vines to manure and water during summer. Easy and lazy gardening, yes; but very good permacultural practice. It means next season's melons are already planted. Nice promises that will definitely be kept!\n\nThese melons, with rich yellow-orange coloured skins, originate from the Kalahari region of Africa. The juicy green jellyish pulps from the ripe \"cucumbers\" are delicious and at their best swirled in plain vanilla icecream.

However we must follow two behaviors:    In endothermic process solubility increases with the increase in temperature and vice versa. \n   For example: solubility of potassium nitrate increases with the increase in .             temperature.     \nIn exothermic process solubility decrease with the increase in temperature.  \n  For example:solubility of calcium oxide decreases with the increase in temperature.    Gases are more soluble in cold solvent than in hot solvent. \nNATURE OF SOLUTE AND SOLVENT\n   Solubility of a solute in a solvent purely depends on the nature of both solute and solvent. \n   A polar solute dissolved in polar solvent.\n   Solubility of a non-polar solute in a solvent is large.\n   A polar solute has low solubility or insoluble in a non-polar solvent. \nEFFECT OF PRESSURE\n   The effect of pressure is observed only in the case of gases. \n   An increase in pressure increases of solubility of a gas in a liquid.\n   For example carbon di oxide is filled in cold drink bottles (such as coca cola, Pepsi 7up etc.)under pressure.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Factors Affecting Solubility", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T08:50:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4crDWqiFq0M", "description": "That's my first video on this channel and i hope you like it.

Both standalone and grid-connected operation modes in the dc side of the microgrid are analyzed. Concretely, a three-level hierarchical control system is implemented. In the primary control level, the decentralized control is realized by using the droop method. Local ac current proportional-resonant controller and dc voltage proportional-in-tegral controller are employed. When the local load is connected to the dc bus, dc droop control is applied to obtain equal or proportional dc load current sharing. The common secondary control level is designed to eliminate the dc bus voltage deviation produced by the droop control, with dc bus voltage in the hybrid microgrid boosted to an acceptable range.

(July 24, 2014) \u2014 A teenager with a form of a rare condition called gigantism needs help finding shoes for the new school year, since his feet have grown so big.\n\nLike any big sister, Brandy Ellinger wants the world for her younger brother Dakota Deal. Lately, though, she\u2019s just wanted something simple.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just hard to find,\u201d Ellinger said.\n\nShe\u2019s talking about Dakota\u2019s shoes. A small part of life for most of us, shoes have become a big problem for him. Diagnosed with a rare form of gigantism, his bones don\u2019t stop growing and at just 13 years old, he\u2019s a size 20, 4E width.\n\nshoesThat\u2019s close to Shaquille O\u2019Neal, at size 23, and bigger than even the Pacers\u2019 Roy Hibbert.\n\n\u201cWhen we do find them, they last for three or four months and he just goes through them fast,\u201d Ellinger said.\n\nAt Decatur Middle School, Dakota\u2019s teacher Jenny Gaston sees his size affect him from day-to-day.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really notice how his stature affects him in the classroom until you can\u2019t put him in a regular seat because his legs don\u2019t fit under the table,\u201d Gaston said.\n\nSo, the school got him better seating and even a new keyboard for his bigger hands.\n\nAs for Dakota himself, in some ways he has learned to accept his size. That\u2019s especially true in his love of football and wrestling.\n\n\u201cJohn Cena\u2019s my favorite and I want to be just like him,\u201d Dakota said.\n\nWhen it comes to fitting in at his age it\u2019s not always easy, though.\n\n\u201c(Kids) would say a rude comment like, \u2018Hey big foot,\u2019 and I wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d Dakota said.\n\nThat\u2019s even more reason Ellinger is hoping someone will help her find a place to get Dakota some cool new shoes that he can show off this school year. They\u2019d be a little piece of normalcy for a kid with a big heart.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be called big, you know, he just wants to fit in,\u201d Ellinger said.\n\n\u201cIt would mean the whole world to me,\u201d Dakota said.", "title": "Teen with rare gigantism needs size 20 shoes", "publishedDate": "2014-07-26T01:20:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4d89oAHKOxs", "description": "Dr Murali Bharadwaz MD is a popular teacher , a practising physician with MD in General Medicine from Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences ,.

Erweitert wurde es um ein Seitenruderservo, standardm\u00e4\u00dfig fliegt es mit Quer und H\u00f6henruder. Material ist EPP, die Flugeigenschaften sind von Zeitlupenlangsam bis durchaus explosiv zu bezeichnen. Die Fl\u00fcgel verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber ein unten glattes und oben gew\u00f6lbtes Profil. Ich verwende einen Gws 4 Kanalempf\u00e4nger, Micro Cyclon Motor, Pulsar 12 Regler, Akkus von Duci 3/350 und Lemon 3/460. Das Gewicht lag anfangs, nur 2 zellig und mit 2 Servos geflogen, bei 115 Gramm, nun sind es knapp 140 Gramm.Als Luftschraube verwende ich eine \u00fcber Gummiring gehaltene 8 x 4,3 GWS Luftschraube. Ich kann dieses Modell jedem empfehlen, der nach den X- Twins irgend etwas immernoch handliches aber sch\u00e4rferes Ger\u00e4t sucht. Das sch\u00f6nste Flugbild ergibt sich bei Schwachwind mit Schleichfahrt circa 1 Meter \u00fcber der Wiese geflogen. Sogar in gro\u00dfen Hausg\u00e4rten ist das Modell einsatzf\u00e4hig und Dank EPP nahezu unverw\u00fcstlich. Im Vergleich zu anderen EPP Materialien ist das von Hacker verwendete EPP sehr z\u00e4h und bruchfest. Umso erstaunlicher erscheint der Aufwand und die Qualit\u00e4t der gerundeten Formteile !  Ebenso unterscheidet sich die Farbgebung von anderen EPP Fliegern, Linienzeichnungen der Rumpf-  und Tragfl\u00e4chenteile gemischt mit vollfarbigen Fl\u00e4chen und mehrfarbigen Beschriftungen ergeben auch bei den kleinen Fliegern ein dreidimensionales Erscheinungsbild.  Der mit der Zeit einsetzende Alterungsprozess, Besch\u00e4digungen und Reparaturen mit Epoxikleber verschlechtern das Erscheinungsbild nicht, im Gegenteil die Modelle wirken unwirklich echter und lassen optisch keinen R\u00fcckschlu\u00df auf Ihr Material mehr zu !", "title": "hacker model epp mini furias", "publishedDate": "2008-08-31T09:55:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dFB8ns-r-c", "description": "Baten Kaitos Original Soundtrack\nComposed by Motoi Sakuraba\n________________________\nDisc One\n01 - Introduction Peak\n02 - Nadir's Whale\n03 - To the End of the Journey of Glittering Stars\n04 - Soul Poetry\n05 - The True Mirror\n06 - Vitriolic a Stroke\n07 - Condemnation of Darkness\n08 - Glowing Cloud\n09 - Chaotic Dance\n10 - Rumbling of the Earth\n11 - Coolant\n12 - Valley of the Wind\n13 - Gentle Wind\n14 - To the Garden of the Moon Butterflies in the Moonless Night\n15 - Flowing Through the Rays of the Morning Sun\n16 - Limpidly Flow\n17 - Soft Labyrinth\n18 - Bellflower\n19 - Imperial Dynamics\n20 - Icy Fog Flow\n21 - Feudal Guardian\n22 - Flighty Spirits\n23 - Tenkai Flower Temple\n24 - Mystery Crystal\n25 - Deterioration\n26 - Holo Holo\n27 - Azure Soul Fountain\n28 - Dust Dancing in the Wind\nTotal Time:\n64'34\"\n\nDisc Two\n01 - Dead Beat\n02 - Disorder\n03 - Castle in the Sand\n04 - Divine White Bell\n05 - Start on a Voyage\n06 - Glittering Violet Moon\n07 - Twisted Time and Warped Sky\n08 - Strike Off the Enemy\n09 - Awakening Calamity\n10 - Late at Night\n11 - Level up!\n12 - Class up!\n13 - With the Spirit\n14 - Collision Spray\n15 - Bottom Out\n16 - Hailstorm\n17 - Worldwide Panic\n18 - Brave Way\n19 - Enshrinement\n20 - Keppakudan\n21 - Survival from The Force\n22 - The True Mirror ~guitar ver~\n23 - Supreme Ruler of the Nine Heavens\n24 - Violent Storm\n25 - A Last Villainous Quip\n26 - Earth Advent\n27 - Deep Sea of Tears\n28 - Addressing the Stars\n29 - To the Party of the Future with a Fragrant White Peach", "title": "Baten Kaitos OST - Bellflower", "publishedDate": "2008-06-15T19:18:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dFcHWcaX1M", "description": "For more product info click here http://bit.ly/PneumaticImpactHammer\n\nThis is the Craftsman Medium Duty Impact Hammer.

Bring it to school, to picnic or party- fun to eat and share AND guilt-free. In terms of the amount to bake, use more potatoes than you would if boiling because you're dehydrating them and the bake fries will be reduced in volume from the water loss.\n\nGive me thumbs up if you enjoyed. \n\nCheck this guide for a simple way to live better in many ways: http://vegankit.com/", "title": "FRENCH FRIES Food Hack: High Carb Low fat, Oil-Free, Salt-Free, Vegan Recipe", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T02:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dGpteJyMK8", "description": "Written and produced in 2013 by Chris Christodoulou for the roguelike-like game Risk of Rain:\nBuy the album: http://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain\nBuy the game: http://riskofraingame.com", "title": "Tropic of Cancer - Risk of Rain OST, Chris Christodoulou", "publishedDate": "2013-08-02T14:01:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dGvs4qnmes", "description": "Blindman's Vision performing the track \"Hear You Calling\" live at The Talking Heads in Southampton on 05/12/12.", "title": "Hear You Calling ( by Blind Man's Vision)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-07T20:29:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dHNWNpdaco", "description": "A professional mold maker & molder based in Taiwan.

When immersed, this diuresis increases about 7 times, i.e. it becomes about 350 ml/h. If the person feels cold, this diuresis increases even further. In these circumstances, it is not uncommon for a diver to lose in 5 hours of diving between 1500 and 2000 ml of water through diuresis. Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphates are lost through diuresis and perspiration. Restoring fluids in these long duration dives is mandatory. Drinking large amounts of fluids immediately before diving as a way of hydrating is not very effective, since almost all the liquid drank is eliminated in the first hours, and the distention of the stomach from excessive liquid may cause gastroesophageal reflux with epigastric burning and acid regurgitation in the mouth.\nImmersed hydration should be gradual, similar to what athletes do. Every hour, an amount of around 300 ml seems reasonable, since in addition to avoiding the disadvantages cited above, the diver remains adequately hydrated with a slightly positive hydric balance, which is beneficial for diving.\n\n\nO ser humano apresenta, em m\u00e9dia, 50 ml/h de diurese no ambiente terrestre. Quando submerso, a diurese aumenta algo em torno de sete vezes, ou seja, passa para 350 ml/h. Caso sinta frio, h\u00e1 ainda um incremento na diurese. N\u00e3o \u00e9 incomum sob tais circunst\u00e2ncias, o mergulhador perder em 5 horas de mergulho entre 1500 e 2000 ml de \u00e1gua por essa via. Eletr\u00f3litos, tais como s\u00f3dio, pot\u00e1ssio, magn\u00e9sio e fosfatos, s\u00e3o perdidos por meio da diurese e da perspira\u00e7\u00e3o.\nA reposi\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidos nos mergulhos de longa dura\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 mandat\u00f3ria. A ingest\u00e3o de grandes quantidades de fluidos imediatamente antes do mergulho, como forma de hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o surte muito efeito, pois quase todo l\u00edquido ingerido \u00e9 eliminado nas primeiras horas e a distens\u00e3o do est\u00f4mago pelo excesso de l\u00edquido pode provocar refluxo gastroesof\u00e1gico com queimor epig\u00e1strico, assim como regurgita\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cida na boca.\nA hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o submersa deve ser gradual, \u00e0 semelhan\u00e7a do que os atletas fazem. De hora em hora, a ingest\u00e3o de quantidades em torno de 300 ml parece ser algo razo\u00e1vel, pois, al\u00e9m de evitar os inconvenientes supracitados, mant\u00e9m o mergulhador adequadamente hidratado com um balan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico levemente positivo, o que \u00e9 ben\u00e9fico para o mergulho.", "title": "Hydration During the Dive", "publishedDate": "2012-11-23T15:26:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJ48voLBew", "description": "Free sample from my lab\n\nLink here : \nhttps://soundcloud.com/humana-dj_producer/rave-chord", "title": "Humana - Rave chord", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T14:43:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJ72L3hlW0", "description": "Cumbia Peruana.\nHoy, ma\u00f1ana y siempre...\nhttp://cprolima.blogspot.com", "title": "Manuel Mantilla - Pagaras (canta Carlos Ramirez)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-10T19:26:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJBZaSwU2g", "description": "", "title": "4 dagur", "publishedDate": "2014-06-18T17:33:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJDSCDIjJo", "description": "Learn More: http://dansperry.com\n\nClips from Dan Sperry featured doing street magic in Hamburg to promote the world tour of THE ILLUSIONISTS, the #1 Largest and Best-Selling Magic Show In The World!\n\nJoin Dan on Facebook: http://dansperryonfacebook.com\nFollow Dan on Twitter: http://twitter.com/dansperry\nShop Dan Sperry: http://shop.dansperry.com\nZombie Java: http://zombie-java.com", "title": "Shock Illusionist Dan Sperry : Anti-Conjuror : In Hamburg Germany", "publishedDate": "2013-10-18T19:41:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJQ3c36Jhw", "description": "Hope you guys are well and that you all have a fantastic weekend.\nx\nn", "title": "A little sympathy here", "publishedDate": "2009-10-09T16:04:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJc9hkUxh0", "description": "http://georgegodley.com/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/geogodley\nhttps://twitter.com/geogodley\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/GeoGodley/213431738712281", "title": "biotin holland barret wed 6 mar 2013 George Godley London U.K 00178", "publishedDate": "2013-03-08T10:23:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dJlV_BM20U", "description": "", "title": "The Innocents - Ending", "publishedDate": "2012-01-20T19:29:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4dKITEUumJU", "description": "Wylla gives Effie and Hazel a track ball demo.

Others translate it at \"Snot-nosed\".\n\nHanatarash are infamous for their extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on-stage destruction and utter disregard for anyone's safety. The most notorious incident involved Yamatsuka throwing junk around with a backhoe inside a venue. On another occasion, he inflicted a deep wound on his leg with an electrical saw, but carried on with the show. A dead cat is also known to have been cut in half during a show. The band once caused so much damage to a live house in Kyoto that it was forced to close.\n\nAt a 1985 gig in Tokyo's Superloft, Hanatarash had the audience fill out forms relieving the band of responsibility for any possible bodily harm caused by the performance. The show stopped just as Yamatsuka was about to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage, which was gasoline-drenched from a barrel. The performance cost the venue \u00a5600,000 ($6000) in repair costs.\n\nSoon unable to be allowed to play anywhere, Yamatsuka went on to form Ultra Freak Out Or Die and Boredoms, among countless other projects. The 1990s saw Hanatarash resurface with some releases and performances, sans on-stage mayhem.\n\n\"4: AIDS-a-Delic\" is one of thier releases and the reason why I say that is because this album was either released in 1996 or 1994. I have used the alternative cover of this album because the original one has female nipples on it and youtube fears those.
