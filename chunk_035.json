It is a spin-off of the Saint Seiya anime series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada, produced in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the franchise. The series began broadcasting in Japan on TV Asahi on April 1, 2012. It is directed by Morio Hatano (his debut as series director), with animation character designs by illustrator and animator Yoshihiko Umakoshi, known for performing the same duties on Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, HeartCatch PreCure! and Casshern Sins.\n\nThe series follows a young teenager known as Koga who becomes one of the 88 warriors protecting the Goddess Athena known as Saints. As the Pegasus Bronze Saint, Koga embarks on a journey to increase his power to save Athena while meeting some other Saints. For the second season, the series tells the conflict between Athena and her sister Pallas which starts a new war. The series also got a manga adaptation and a fighting game.\n\nOmega was created as an alternative to the series' direct sequel Saint Seiya: Next Dimension due to lack of material to adapt. As a result, rather than refocusing on the returning cast, Toei created a new generation of Saint who would succeed the old cast. Critical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre.\n\nThe storyline of Omega takes place 25 years after the Holy Wars of the 20th century narrated in the original manga and its anime adaptation. The goddess Athena is still on Earth after reincarnating to continue her duty of protecting peace against several antagonistic deities. Athena and a new generation of Saints prepare to face new threats that lurks in this new era, in which Pegasus Seiya, the protagonist of Kurumada's manga, is revered as a Saint of legend and one of Athena's Gold Saints.\n\nThe first part of the series is the \"Mars Saga\" (\u30de\u30eb\u30b9\u7de8 Marusu Hen), introducing the new Pegasus Saint Koga and his friends Dragon Ryuhou, Lionet Souma, Wolf Haruto, Aquila Yuna, Orion Eden, and Aria and the beginning of their fight against the God of War Mars in his quest to capture Aria to become the new Athena. The second part is the \"Zodiac Temples Saga\" (\u5341\u4e8c\u5bae\u7de8 J\u016bniky\u016b Hen), featuring Koga and his friends fight against the many Gold Saints who have aligned themselves with Mars in their fight to save Athena before it is too late.\n\nThe second season begins the \"New Cloth Saga\" (\u65b0\u751f\u8056\u8863\uff08\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\uff09\u7de8 Ny\u016b Kurosu Hen), introducing Athena's new enemy Pallas and her Pallasite warriors, a new ally in the Steel Saint Subaru, and new powers with their stronger New Cloths. The second half of season 2 comprises the \"Omega Awakens Saga\" (\u03a9\u899a\u9192\u7de8 Omega Kakusei Hen), where Athena and her many Saints take their war with Pallas to her stronghold Pallasvelda, where Pallas's elite Pallasites begin to conspire against her.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that the Omega animated series would be adapted to manga form, and it started serialization on March 26, 2013, in Kadokawa Shoten's Kerokero Ace magazine. The comic book contains the arcs of the first season and it also adapted the second season. Its only tank\u014dbon volume was released on September 23, 2013.\n\nAs an installment separate from Kurumada's work, the series will introduce characters new to the Saint Seiya fictional universe, that will make use of elements already established within it. Some of them, such as the deities, exist in the original manga. Additionally, known elements from Saint Seiya, such as the Cloths, the armors worn by the Saints, bear their known constellations, but are presented in Omega with a new design that differs substantially from those in the original source material, and departing from it, the Cloths emerge from jewels worn by the characters to envelop their bodies, which are known in Omega as ClothStones (\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3 Kurosut\u014dn).\n\nThe Cosmo essence, one of the basic concepts of Saint Seiya, is expanded in Omega with the addition of specific elemental properties: Fire (\u706b Hi), Wind (\u98a8 Kaze), Thunder (\u96f7 Kaminari), Earth (\u571f Tsuchi), Water (\u6c34 Mizu), Darkness (\u95c7 Yami) and Light (\u5149 Hikari).", "title": "Saint Seiya Omega OST Soundtrack \u8056\u95d8\u58eb\u4f1d\u8aac", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T21:43:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "19dXMTVX-M0", "description": "Filmmakers Basil Gelpke and Ray McCormack team up to deliver a grave warning in this documentary on the oil industry.

Any money you make in Great Britain is taxed at Great Britain's tax rate, in this case, 25%. And as long as you leave that money in Great Britain, you won't have to pay any more taxes on it.\n\nBut say you want to bring that money back into the United States. Well, before you can bring that money back to invest in the U.S., you have to pay the difference between England's tax rate and the U.S. tax rate, and since the U.S. has the second-highest corporate tax rate in the world, no matter where you're bringing the money from, you're likely to have to pay an extra tax to bring it home to the U.S.\n\nIn this case, you'd have to pay the difference between England's tax rate of 25% and the U.S. tax rate of 35%. It's almost like paying a toll to bring money to the U.S. And that discourages investment in America, year after year. That's money that should be in America -- there shouldn't be a penalty for bringing it home.\n\nSo, what can we do? Well, in addition to reducing our 35% tax rate, the answer may lie in what almost every other developed country has already done. It's called a territorial tax system.\n\nIn a territorial system, companies only pay taxes on the profits earned here in America. Profits earned in markets outside the United States can be brought home and invested here year after year, without that added penalty. If you want to bring that money back for jobs, expansion, research, development, whatever -- you don't have to pay any additional tax.\n\nAnd that's not all. Right now, U.S. companies are at a disadvantage when they compete for business abroad. Since their international competitors don't have to pay a toll to move their money back home, the U.S. companies have higher costs in everything they do.\n\nBut switching to a territorial tax system would create a level playing field, letting us win more business around the world. And that's good for our workers here at home.\n\nAnd the increased money invested in the U.S. helps create American jobs and helps grow American businesses. Just a couple ways switching to a territorial tax system can help the American economy. \n\nFor more information, visit tax foundation dot org.", "title": "Corporate Taxes: Advantages of a Territorial System", "publishedDate": "2012-01-03T18:50:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "19eBsmjpIIg", "description": "Mini-Fische Elassoma okefenokee bei der Eiablage im 20Ltr.

We label these muscles axial muscles.\n\nThe polyp is at the lower left of the first image and the stolon projects from it toward the upper right. Muscles are visualized by rhodamine phalloidin staining of F-actin. The blue dots are nuclei stained with DAPI. \n\nAt the base of the polyp, in the first frame, one sees a continues ring of F-actin. These are circular muscle (CM) fibers of the polyp, which are gastrodermal. Outside of this ring one sees, in cross-section, the ectodermal longitudinal muscles (LM) of the polyp. As the frames progress one is moving below the polyp into the underlying stolon. The circular muscles clearly extend into and along the proximal-distal axis of the stolon, where they are properly said to be axial (AX). \n\nNote also that the longitudinal muscles of the polyp do not extend far beyond the apical surface of the stolon. \n\nOptical depth: 6 \u03bcm \n# of sections: 12\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nBuss, L.

You\u2019ve seen what\u2019s been happening in Colorado, Its created some other thorny legal issues, like banks not being able to accept money from the people who are legally selling the marijuana in the state of Colorado. Would it cause more legal problems than perhaps prevent? Why do you want to legalize marijuana?\n\nBrandan: I\u2019m frankly just sick and tired of this fight for prohibition as if it's worked, Tom. I look at the all of the lives that have been lost. This is a war that has cost us our civil liberties. It\u2019s cost us untold numbers in people getting stamped and stuck with a conviction.\n\nAnd frankly when someone was able to pick between choosing a safer substance or choosing alcohol and they\u2019re criminalized for it, I think that that\u2019s a serious problem and our nation needs to fight for that. \n\nIf anything, people like to say that this has been a gateway drug. It absolutely has not. If you look at our past four presidents past usage, it has been a gateway to the white house. And its the only thing that has kept people from making a difference in their lives, its the stigma of a drug conviction. That to me is fundamentally wrong. \n\nSo get the people off of the battlefield first. Medicinal has to happen in this state, and we need comprehensive reform.\"\n//\nBrandan: \u201cSo when I look at things like jurisdictions that we need to lend our help to, absolutely I would be there lending help where it is appropriate.

Since the 5th century BC, several walls have been built that were referred to as the Great Wall. One of the most famous is the wall built between 220206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Little of that wall remains; the majority of the existing wall were built during the Ming Dynasty.  The Great Wall stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east to Lop Nur in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The most comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has recently concluded that the entire Great Wall, with all of its branches, stretches for 8,851.8 km. This is made up of 6,259.6 km of sections of actual wall, 359.7 km of trenches and 2,232.5 km of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.  During the 1440s1460s, the Ming built an extension to the Great Wall, which is called \"Liaodong Wall\". This section of the Great Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province, protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north. Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600. Under the military command of Yuan Chonghuan, the Ming army held off the Manchus at the heavily fortified Shanhaiguan pass, preventing the Manchus from entering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, when the gates at Shanhaiguan were opened by Wu Sangui, a Ming border general who was bribed and blackmailed to do so and who also disliked the activities of rulers of the Shun Dynasty. The Manchus quickly seized Beijing, and defeated the newly founded Shun Dynasty and remaining Ming resistance, to establish the Qing Dynasty. Under Qing rule, China's borders extended beyond the walls and Mongolia was annexed into the empire, so construction and repairs on the Great Wall were discontinued.", "title": "The Great Wall of China", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T10:43:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ALB1OY6IdY", "description": "Discover the A/W12 collection, inspired by the British countryside, featuring runway models and magical woodland animals.\n\nDiscover more: http://bit.ly/YJ4yNr", "title": "A Burberry Woodland Adventure", "publishedDate": "2012-12-17T10:38:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ALs9TwzM3o", "description": "Tailormade is a documentary film about a promising young amateur boxer named Bucky and the Rise and Fall of the Junior Black Mafia aka \"J.B.M\".

Am I going to get a loft?\nAnswer: Yes and no. If you are on the first floor of a building, they have instead 1 bed and 1 bunk bed for 2 people. If you live on the top floor of the building, you will get a loft because there is no one above you therefore, more space.\n\n2) How much money will I save if I get a triple instead?\nAnswer: At A-I and Pentland Hills, you are discounted $300 per quarter. At East Lothian, you get $150 per quarter.\n\n3) Which dorm has A/C?\nAnswer: Pentland Hills, A-I (I have heard of some but not all), and East Lothian.\n\n4) Which dorm is bigger?\nAnswer: I have toured A-I dorms and in my opinion, they are the biggest. However,  it is a bit \"run down.\" Pentland is the newest dorm, is mid-sized when it comes to Triple and not bad for Double. Lothian to me, has the smallest space. But again, depends on how you organize things. A room at Lothian can be spacious if you organize right, stay clean, and don't bring too much junk.\n\n5) Are all the Triples the same?\nAnswer: Sort of. Pentland definitely has the highest loft (Which means more headspace above you as you can see in the video) whereas A-I has a lowered loft but it has much more space and room than a Pentland loft.\n\n6) Which rooms are the biggest in terms of floor level? \nAnswer: The top floor will always be the biggest and have the most space. To find out what level you are, you will receive in the mail your \"UCR Room Assignment.\" In the video above, my room # was B331. You are given a Pentland Letter (Ex: B) followed by 3 digits. The top levels will always be 3XX, and the bottom levels will be 2XX and 1XX, respectively. That is how you find out which floor you are on. I forget the set up for Lothian and A-I but it should be similar.\n\n7) Why do you have so many pairs of shoes??\nAnswer: Walking for UCR Campus.\n\n8) Which dorm is the most social?\nAnswer: A-I is usually the most social group, Lothian is somewhat social as well, and Pentland Hills can be quite social too if you just so happen to have party people as dormmates! Regardless, Pentland Hills is the best place to study at. There are large study lounges and small tutor rooms right beneath the Pentland buildings! Ideally, these are much better than the ones at A-I or Lothian. One could also always walk to the Science Library which isn't a far distance from Pentland.\n\n9) I don't like my furniture arrangement. What can I do to make it more roomy?\nAnswer: Consult with your roommates on Move-in Day and decide how to arrange the furniture. There are endless possibilities for furniture arrangement. I had dormmates who brought the drawer up to the loft, one who covered the window with the dresser, someone who fit the drawer under their single bed, and others who removed the mirrors of their closet to make space. The rule of thumb, is that you can arrange/take out things so long as you do not damage and/or put it back to where it belonged originally by the end of the school year. Keep in mind this video was taken during the first week of Fall 2009.

This segment is featured in the K-2 Life Science module, Eco Awareness.\n\nHave you ever heard about the environment? The environment is the natural world around us -- \nNature! The environment is made up of both living and nonliving things like rocks, earthworms, streams, trees and clouds. All of these things put together make up our environment. \n \nAll of the living things that help make up the environment depend on each other to meet their \nneeds. That includes people like you too! But people have to be careful, because the things we do can make big changes for other living things. That's why it's important to practice eco awareness. \n \nEco awareness is a long word, but if we break it down it's easy to understand. Eco stands for the environment, or the natural world. Awareness is noticing or thinking about something. \n\nSo we can put them together like this: \n \nthe natural world + thinking = eco awareness \n \nWhen we think about how our actions affect the natural world, we are practicing eco awareness.\n\nScience4Us is an interactive, K-2 online science curriculum that engages students with over 350 animated activities, ideas for hand-on projects, and offline activities and printable worksheets.

Preliminary, not-yet-published results show the presence of what could be fossilised insect eggs and hints of a potential brain remnant of the hominid.\n\nThe use of X-ray synchrotron microtomography for studying fossils has been developed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, by Paul Tafforeau.

Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) receives a 70-year-old letter from his inventor friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who tells Marty that he has retreated a century in time to live out a relatively quiet life in the Old West. Doc Brown reveals that he hid his DeLorean car/time machine in an abandoned mine outside town, and when Marty does some research and discovers that the Doc died shortly after writing the letter, he decides to find the car, travel back in time, and warn the Doc about his demise. Meanwhile, the Doc, who has fallen in love with a local woman (Mary Steenburgen), realizes he can't hide in the past from the problems he has caused to the time flow in the previous two adventures. He reluctantly decides to return to the present with Marty, but first, they have to find a way to get the DeLorean up to time-travel velocity with a broken fuel line and no gasoline.\n\n\"back to the future part 3\",\"michael j fox\",\"christopher lloyd\",\"mary steenburgen\",\"elisabeth shue\",\"todd cameron brown\",\"dannel evans\",freddie,\"robert zemeckis\",\"picture videos\",\"train videos\",westerns,\"action adventure\",\"ages 11-12\",\"ages 8-10\",\"children family\",\"family sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"steven spielberg\",\"kathleen kennedy\",\"frank marshall\",\"steve starkey\",\"neil canton\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++3673,/m/0hz_1,/m/01l_yg,/m/014g22,/m/02jr26", "title": "Back to the Future Part 3 (10/10) Movie CLIP - Your Future Is Whatever You Make It (1990) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T11:55:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "1AtNSTooA3A", "description": "Lewis Acid-Base Theory:According to this theory electron pair acceptor is an acid and the species that donates electron pair is a Lewis base.The species with lone pairs of electrons act as a Donor i.e Lewis base.Ammonia, water, floride, chloride, Hydroxide can donate electron pairs.The species having vacant orbitals could act as an Acceptor i.e Lewis acid.Boron hydride, Berilium chloride, Alluminium chloride, silver ion, carbonium ion can accept electron pairs.The strong acid donates a proton to a strong base easily.The conjugate acid of a strong base is week, similarly the conjugate base of a strong acid is week.\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\nK-12.

After Jesus had entered heaven, Peter and John continued to spread the word of the Kingdom of God to the people. The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees heard them and were greatly disturbed for the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead (Acts 4:1-2). (The Sadducees were a small, conservative but powerful group of Jews closely connected with the high priests who only accepted the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures. They also did not believe in life after death). They seized Peter and John and because it was evening, put them in jail (Acts 4:3). But many had heard the message from the apostles, and the number of believers grew to about five thousand (Acts 4:4). \nThe next day Peter and John were brought to the Sanhedrin (Supreme Council and Court in ancient Jerusalem) and questioned (Acts 4:5-6). Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit responded: \"If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed. Then know this, you and all the people of Israel, it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed\" (Acts 4:8-10). \"Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\" said Peter (Acts 4:12). The Sanhedrin saw the courage of Peter and John as ordinary, unschooled men, and they were astonished and took note these men had been with Jesus (Acts 4:13). But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say (Acts 4:14). So they ordered them from the Sanhedrin then conferred together knowing that many people knew the apostles had done an outstanding miracle, and they wanted to stop this thing from spreading any further (Acts 4:15-17). When Peter and John were brought back into the court, they were commanded not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus (Acts 4:18). Peter and John responded saying \"Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God\" (Acts 4:19). After further threats, they released Peter and John, because all the people were praising God for what had happened (Acts 4:21). \nThought for today: God takes time to speak through His living word, be sure to take time to listen.", "title": "#815- Before The Sanhedrin", "publishedDate": "2012-08-16T03:59:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "1B0gPmYqzAI", "description": "www.facebook.com/Beka.Polityczna - zapraszamy na polityczne \u017carty ;)", "title": "Barrack Obama o\u015bmieszony na szczycie G20!", "publishedDate": "2014-08-07T09:57:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "1B0tPSlJdls", "description": "this recording was a part of the 'Whoreshipping the Depths' recording session, but did not make the album, so I made it available here.....", "title": "SxuperioN - The Aggressive and Violent Journey Towards Sociopathic Freedom", "publishedDate": "2012-06-18T05:10:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "1B0ztVx-y3Q", "description": "", "title": "SCREW - DUALITY", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T06:30:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "1B11apJfZ7Y", "description": "Harvesting and propagating yacon or sunchoke (Polymnia sonchifolia).

While other kids eat their usual chicken fingers and pepperoni pizza, Mitch Spinach mixes up his meal in a battery-powered blender before their curious and envious eyes. Although he is the smartest, nicest, strongest kid in Ms. Radicchio's class, he often misses recess when he is called to Principal Lycopene's office. The truth is that his high-powered fruit and vegetable smoothies give him special powers, such as super-sonic hearing and amazing night vision, which help him tackle problems and solve mysteries at Sunchoke Elementary.\n\nLaunching at the end of May 2011, is the second exciting adventure in the series, Mitch Spinach and the Smell of Victory. Everyone at Sunchoke Elementary now knows that Mitch Spinach is no ordinary kid. In this exciting field day adventure, Mitch Spinach receives a coded message on his futuristic watch asking him to report to the gym. After rescuing Becca out on the field, he is determined to help Principal Lycopene find the missing key to the trophy case.

Find out how Mitch Spinach fuels his remarkable sense of smell and boosts his brain power to take on this new challenge in Book 2 of the Mitch Spinach series.\n\n\"This book changed my son's life, I am not even joking.

Great story, wonderful art, very nicely done! I'll be taking it by the school and showing the school board as well, hopefully we can get this book onto school shelves for maximum exposure!

Tisha Joy-\n\nI have been obsessing about the fact that my 8-year-old granddaughter has been only eating macaroni and cheese and peanut butter and jelly for the past several years. She won't touch fruit or vegetables. I thought Mitch Spinach might be a good book to help her understand why it's important to try new things and begin to eat healthy food. I sent the book to her in Chicago, and she read it with my daughter and she began to eat carrots, some fruit and other vegetables. Thank you for writing this book. It really helped.

Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different. They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.\n\n\"revolutionary road\",\"revolutionary road clip\",\"revolutionary road trailer\",\"revolutionary road part 1\",\"leonardo dicaprio\",\"kate winslet\",\"cigarette videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",\"scott rudin\",\"david m thompson\",\"ann ruark\",\"karen gehres\",\"marion rosenberg\",\"sam mendes\",\"pippa harris\",\"nina wolarsky\",\"gina amoroso\",\"henry fernaine\",\"john hart\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++395937,/m/0dvmd,/m/0dvld", "title": "Revolutionary Road (1/8) Movie CLIP - You're Sick!

Winters Company offers plumbing, heating, cooling. If you need service today; we're the business to call. My website is wintershomeservices.com. I'll be talking to you today about plumbing. \n\nHow do you know if you have a leak in your toilet? There's a couple of ways you can figure that out. Number one, you might need some food coloring or a dye tablet, which I'm about to show you. It's really difficult to see a leak on white shiner, especially with water, so if you wanted to see this bowl with a little bit of water in it. A running toilet can literally cost you hundreds and hundreds of dollars, if left unattended. If you hear a toilet filling in the middle of the night, that's not a good thing. \n\nSo what I'm going to show you right now is a little dye tablet that we put in the back of your toilet tanks. I'll take the dye tablet, I open it up, put the contents of the packet inside the water basin here, and then I let it sit and wait for about 5 or 10 minutes, so if blue shows up inside the bowl, we have a leak so let's take a peek. It's blue. So we have a leak.\n\nAlright, so we have a leak in the toilet from the tank to the bowl, and usually the situation is a flapper. So, the first thing you want to do is take that flapper that you have in your toilet with you. There are a bunch of them to get, because if you didn't take the one with you it's going to be very difficult for you to match up to what you really have. And the toilet that we're working on? This is a genuine part for that manufacturer, you can see it has that yellow float on it. This float actually helps keep this flapper up while the water's passing underneath it and it lets it fall back down as well. \n\nThis is our replacement part for our flapper that's leaking inside this bowl, inside this tank. So what I'm gonna do is, take out the old part and basically how it comes out is, you'll see that it snaps in on the other side. So you have to use some firm pressure to pull up, but you don't want to use too much, it is plastic so you want to be careful that you don't snap it, twist it, you want to be able to lift it straight up. \n\nWe're going to disconnect the chain, and you see this chain is quite long, and you don't want to have as much chain. Once you make the adjustment, you want to either clip off or break these links. We have our new piece ready to go in, and it goes in the same way that it came out, and you want to be able to reach in and you're going to want to snap these back down by going straight over the top, and you should hear a click--there's one! And then you're looking to hear it click again--there's two! You want to make sure that our chain has enough links, but not too much, and this is kind of a trial and error thing, so you want to put that one there... let me give it a little test to see how it works. Then we're going to fill the tank back up. Okay, I'm happy with the way it works. Okay, so you just fixed the flapper in your toilet.\"", "title": "How to Fix a Running Toilet | Plumbing Repairs", "publishedDate": "2011-06-08T20:38:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1BXhi4ndyqw", "description": "Punk Rock", "title": "Creciendo - Dextrin", "publishedDate": "2010-10-17T21:26:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1BXisT1m7b4", "description": "http://wj.la/1h3V1Uc", "title": "Daniel Milzman, Georgetown student, charged with ricin possession", "publishedDate": "2014-03-22T03:25:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1BXv0ir8Kd4", "description": "ReCkLeSs GaMeRz   PRaTiciNG eDiTz", "title": "Crash Bounce Edit", "publishedDate": "2009-10-25T17:51:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "1BYAMXj0NWU", "description": "Vamos a estudiar qu\u00e9 es la conciencia intencional y de qu\u00e9 forma se explica, dentro de la fenomenolog\u00eda, este concepto tan interesante desarrollado por el gran Edmund Husserl.", "title": "E.

Learn more at midmark.com.\n\nThis video is an overview of monthly maintenance for your autoclave. However always refer to the appropriate technical documentation for the complete list of instructions, safety alerts and sequence of procedures before conducting any service or maintenance operations.  \nFor maximum operational flexibility the M9 and M11 autoclaves offer four pre-programmed cycles with the flexibility to store two custom cycles. Once a custom program has been stored it can be used just by pushing the one or two control buttons in the same manner as the other standard cycles. To program one of the two programmable cycles select either the one or two button on the control panel and follow the prompts on the unit display to set the desired sterilizing temperature, sterilizing time, type of vent and amount of drying time. For this example we'll use program one. The display will show the current store program and all cycle parameters to reprogram start by selecting the P Button and the display will show sterilization temp and the current value. Then press the plus or minus button to adjust followed by P for next, or stop to cancel. Any temperature from 230 degrees Fahrenheit up to 275 degrees Fahrenheit can be selected.  Once the P button is selected, the display will show sterilization time, and the current value.\nThen you may press the plus or minus button to adjust the values followed by P for next, or STOP to cancel. By pushing the plus or minus buttons the sterilization time can be changed from three to ninety minutes in one minute increments. \nWhen the desired time is reached press P to store it, and progress to vent type. The display will show vent type and the current value. Pushing the plus button sets it to fast vent. The vent will open fully. Pushing the minus button sets it to slow vent. The vent will open for a fraction of a second once per minute, until the chamber is vented.\nThe display shows drying time and the current number of minutes.  \nBy pushing the plus or minus button the drying time can be changed in one minute increments. Dry time can be set from zero to 60 minutes. Once the desired drying time is displayed, press the P button to store the program. Now if you select the one button the display will show the new parameters. These parameters will remain in memory until they are changed and will remain even if the sterilizer has the power turned off by unplugging. Pressing the stop button any time during the programming procedure will cancel the changes and revert to the original settings. \nFor more detailed information about maintaining your autoclave, please refer to the M9/M11 installation and operation manual.

The platform of the Makaira series was designed around what Okuma calls its 4D concept, which incorporates the Design, Drive, Drag and Durability of the overall reel. The Makaira series represents the first Okuma project where Okuma worked jointly with Tiburon Engineering USA, setting out to build the ultimate game reel.\n\nThe heart of the Makaira series revolves around the patented DFD or Dual Force Drag system that was designed by Tiburon Engineering. This unique drag system was engineered around a pull bar drag system principle that virtually eliminates the pressure commonly created by the alternative style push bar drag system, which completely relies on the strength of the reel frame for structural support. The DFD is a wet drag system utilizing dual Carbonite drag washers and Cal Sheets drag grease. To further enhance this ultimate drag system, Tiburon custom-designed a thrust bearing that is designed to absorb side load pressure. This abnormally large bearing allows anglers to fish extremely high drag loads without the increase in handle pressure.\n\nEnhancing the overall performance of this series, Okuma has equipped the Makaira with EZO Japanese ABEC-5 ball bearings that provide excellent freespool for live baiting and casting. The Makaira series sets itself apart from all other reels by offering Okumas proprietary silent anti-reverse system that Okuma equates to high performance luxury products such as a Lexus.  Working in conjunction with the silent retrieve system is our unique helical-cut gear process. The Makaira is the only machined aluminum 2-speed trolling reel to feature helical-cut gears which are smoother, quieter, offer more torque and receive less impact blows when compared to the traditional spur-cut or straight-cut gearing used in most 2-speed reels. For a combination of ultimate hardness and corrosion resistance Okuma machines all of its gears, shafts and drag plates from 17-4 marine-grade stainless steel for uncompromised durability.\n\nFor ultimate strength and precision tolerances, the Makaira is supported by 6061-T6 grade forged aluminum side plates and extruded 6061-T6 aluminum frame.  All aluminum parts are either anodized gold with a type-II anodizing process or black anodized with a Type-III process in critical corrosion points. Pack all of these features into one reel series and throw in the patented T-bar handle with an 18-degree offset handle and you have the blueprint for one of the industrys top offshore lever drag reels.", "title": "Okuma Makaira", "publishedDate": "2009-07-13T17:18:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "1C3d5TkulRE", "description": "DOG IS A ROO' DOO'", "title": "Doggy ate my slops", "publishedDate": "2008-08-27T03:01:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "1C3gzzZ-dI8", "description": "I do not own the rights to this song.", "title": "The Heirs OST - Bite My Lower Lip by Esna with lyrics", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T14:07:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "1C4W7Hj0Xq4", "description": "James tells us what we need to survive a night in the wilderness that is Newcastle.", "title": "MTVUK - Geordie Shore - James' Survival Kit", "publishedDate": "2014-08-14T11:01:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1C4nsg9zb9w", "description": "Buy Sofia the First Talking Magical Amulet here:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BY2ER66 \n\nLittle girls can learn to be a princess with the Talking Magical Amulet, a beautiful and magical necklace that is just like Sofia's.

There are no real roads, no electricity and no services. But this is also a village where only the 'lower caste' live and, more unusually, a village where no men reside. \n\nEvery capable man and boy has gone to work in the capital of neighbouring India, Delhi, while the women toil alone on the tough terrain for most of the year. Only once or twice a year, the men come back for short breaks. \n\nIt's not just the geography in this out-of-reach spot or their gender that holds back the women and girls of Shiradi. It's also traditions and caste. Despite robust economic growth, South Asia is a region of widening gaps between rich and poor. In Nepal, this disparity has been brought into even sharper relief by a rise in the number of millionaires, while the majority of the population still lives on under $1.25 a day. In addition, unique caste divides cut deep, as ethnic and tribal groups are marginalized.  \n\nhttp://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/nepal_56213.html", "title": "Nepal - Children of a lessor God?", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19T09:47:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CA_uFJnwKs", "description": "Google's head of north European sales, Matt Brittin, faces questioning for the second time about the company's UK tax affairs.

Ruddy\nScreenwriter: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo\nFilm Description: Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.\n\n\"the godfather\",\"the godfather clip\",\"the godfather theme\",\"the godfather part 1\",\"al pacino\",\"father joseph medeglia\",\"francis ford coppola\",\"eye glasses videos\",\"classic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",blockbusters,classics,\"crime dramas\",\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",mobster,\"period pieces\",\"gray frederickson\",\"albert s ruddy\",\"aggression videos\",\"deception videos\",\"vengeance videos\",\"church videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++20076,/m/0bj9k", "title": "The Baptism Murders - The Godfather (8/9) Movie CLIP (1972) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T16:54:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CF0iRPOxF8", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Ehowtech\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Ehowtech\n\nMaking a business account ledger in Excel is a great way to keep track of your finances.

This time, it's her own tune 'Rewind', taken from her 'Burn The Sky Down' album, that gets a remix treatment, by producers tyDi, Dabruck & Klein, KATFYR and Mikkas.\n\nIt's been nearly half a year since Emma Hewitt introduced the world to her very first artist album. 'Burn The Sky Down' received a very warm welcome, and its singles 'Colours', 'Foolish Boy' and 'Miss You Paradise' all became big successes. Still stretching the curve, Emma now releases the remix-pack of 'Rewind'. A deep, powerful tune that invited tyDi, Dabruck & Klein, KATFY and Mikkas to create their very own interpretation.\n\nGerman duo Dabruck & Klein, big fans of Emma, transformed the mysterious 'Rewind' into a rocking peak-time house tune, with immediate impact. Portuguese project KATFYR, who previously remixed Emma's 'Foolish Boy', was also invited to drench 'Rewind' with their nrivalled Dubstep sound. Australia's rising star tyDi shows his vocal-chop skills, and delivers a warm, melodic prog remix, while Mikkas brings out all colours with a big-room approach. Four original remixes, each with their own unique sound.\n\nTracks:\n\nRewind (Mikkas Remix) (06:02)\nRewind (Mikkas Radio Edit) (03:35)\nRewind (Dabruck & Klein Remix) (06:24)\nRewind (Dabruck & Klein Radio Edit) (03:30)\nRewind (tyDi Remix) (08:25)\nRewind (tyDi Radio Edit) (03:47)\nRewind (KATFYR Remix) (05:13)\nRewind (KATFYR Remix Edit) (04:04)\nRewind (03:20)", "title": "Emma Hewitt - Rewind (Mikkas Remix)", "publishedDate": "2012-12-03T11:58:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CHbC3Wr5qE", "description": "Special needs person bedridden autism Alzheimer's Disease FTD Frontotemporal Dementia  disable child children patient changing bed hospitalized home care respite care senior care personal assistant living assistance disabled disability disablement  assistant aged dying paralyzed coma bed rest sick handicapped", "title": "Special Needs Children", "publishedDate": "2010-02-18T20:59:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CHczyvxAzo", "description": "Horticulturist Norman Winter - Southern Gardening television segments are produced by the Office of Agricultural Communications for the Mississippi State University Extension Service.", "title": "Grancy Graybeard - MSU Extension Service", "publishedDate": "2010-03-09T14:51:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CIMGqwaFPk", "description": "+44 208 5544 300\nalex@pushkinantiques.com\nhttp://www.pushkinantiques.com\nhttp://stores.ebay.co.uk/Pushkin-Antiques-Ltd\n\nAntique mid-19th Century Victorian Solid Silver inkstand, oval form with raised borders, profusely engraved with flowers and birds, with three square-form inkwell holders beautifully pierced with a floral decoration, the laterals with crested hinged cover and silver pen holder / lid, the central with a pull-off lid applied with a cast figural taperstick.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Nerdy asian guy eating ALIVE octopus for dinner in Korea!!!

This multilingual, Web-based, free content encyclopedia already contains millions of articles, but there's always room for something new. Why not publish something by you?\n\n\nStep 1: Have the right topic\nBefore you try to create an article, make sure you have an appropriate topic. Wikipedia wants unbiased, well-sourced information about subjects that are notable enough to appear in an encyclopedia. The site rejects articles that promote or publicize a business; advice \u2013 legal, medical or otherwise; instructional material; travel guides; and news items. \n\nTip\nGet ideas for topics by typing WP:RA in the search box; a list of articles requested by others will appear.\n\nStep 2: Source your work\nMake sure you get the information for your article from a credible, reliable source. Material in books and newspapers is generally considered reliable; the musings of bloggers are not. And don't bother writing about yourself; it's considered a conflict of interest.\n\nTip\nDetailed instructions on the proper way to cite sources can be found by typing WP:CITE into the search box and hitting \"Go.\"\n\nStep 3: Conduct an internal search\nMake sure Wikipedia hasn't already published an article on your exact subject by typing it into the site's internal search engine. Search as many variations of the topic name as you can think of, including common misspellings of relevant terms. \n\nTip\nClick \"Search\" to find Wikipedia articles that just mention your subject. \n\nStep 4: Google it\nSearch the topic on Google to see if it finds any Wikipedia articles on your subject. Google sometimes picks up postings that Wikipedia's own search engine misses. \n\nStep 5: Sign up\nBecome a registered user to submit an article without first gaining the site's approval. Having an account also means you can create a user profile, receive messages from other users, request notification for changes made to articles, and, of course, get credit for the articles you write. Click on \"create an account\" at the top right of any page. \n\nTip\nIf you'd prefer not to register, submit a proposal through Wikipedia's Articles for Creation, an online review process that provides feedback on your idea. Type WP:AFC in a Search box and hit \"Go.\" \n\nStep 6: Practice writing\nPractice writing an article by composing a draft in the Sandbox, where you can familiarize yourself with the site's editing tools. Get there by typing WP:SB in the Search box and hitting, \"Go.\" Click \"Help\" in the toolbox to the left of any page for guidance. \n\nStep 7: Enter the article\nType your subject in a Search box and hit \"Go.\" You've already determined that no page with that title exists. Click on your highlighted search entry. You'll be redirected to a blank page where you can begin writing your article. \n\nTip\nWikipedia editors may request more sources from you after reviewing your article. \n\nStep 8: Publish!\nWhen your article is finished, hit \"Show Preview\" to proofread your work and see how it will appear on the site. When you're ready to publish it, hit \"Save Page.\" Congratulations! You're a Wikipedian! \n\nDid You Know?\nWikipedia has published articles in more than 250 languages.", "title": "How to Create a Wikipedia Article", "publishedDate": "2010-03-15T14:28:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1CwspDhq5GU", "description": "Check out Othyus Jeffers talking to the guys on NBA Gametime about his D-League Development and the impending playoffs!\n\nThe NBA Development League, the NBA's official minor league, is now on YouTube, showing over 350 live games on the NBA D-League YouTube Channel and NBADLeague.com.

They are excellent for a small garden as they only grow to between 8 - 12ft (3 - 5m).  Grow them as here over a trellis or if you have an old tree stump this also makes a good support.  They will tolerate being planted in any aspect but are especially happy in a cool shady spot.  When you are planting one make sure the pot is well soaked before planting and then water in well.  As with any new planting check on the watering while the plant is established.  They are pruned after flowering when any weak growth or dead stems are removed, the plant can be reduced in size at this time if required.  If you are growing it over an old wall or stump in a wilder area of the garden there is no need to prune.  Look out for the variety Clematis alpina \"Frances Rivis\" which will have good dark blue flowers that are slightly larger than the species.  Also keep an eye out for Clematis macropetela varieties as they are similar to the C. alpina in flower shape but flower slightly later and have the same care requirements.
