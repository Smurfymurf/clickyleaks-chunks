They do not usually have arms or legs until the transition to adulthood, and typically have a large, flattened tail with which they swim by lateral undulation, similar to most fish.\n\n\n\nCaptive common frog tadpoles eating a piece of salmon.\nAs a tadpole matures, it most commonly metamorphosizes by gradually growing limbs (usually the legs first, followed by the arms) and then (most commonly in the case of frogs) outwardly absorbing its tail by apoptosis. Lungs develop around the time of leg development, and tadpoles late in development will often be found near the surface of the water, where they breathe air. During the final stages of external metamorphosis, the tadpole's mouth changes from a small, enclosed mouth at the front of the head to a large mouth the same width as the head. The intestines shorten to accommodate the new diet. Most tadpoles are herbivorous, subsisting on algae and plants. Some species are omnivorous, eating detritus and when available, smaller tadpoles.\n\nTadpoles vary greatly in size, both during their development and between species. For example, in a single family, Megophryidae, length of late-stage tadpoles varies between 33 mm (1.3 in) and 106 mm (4.2 in).[2] The tadpoles of Pseudis paradoxa grow to 25 cm (9.8 in), the largest of any frog.[3]", "title": "A tadpole (also called pollywog or porwigle in British English)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-20T00:59:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZmPMTXqPfw", "description": "Sv\u00e1tek m\u00e1 Josef (Cafasso) \nDnes si p\u0159ipom\u00edn\u00e1me patrona kn\u011b\u017e\u00ed slou\u017e\u00edc\u00edch ve v\u011bznic\u00edch Josefa Cafassa.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given full species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.\n\nGray langurs are large and fairly terrestrial, inhabiting forest, open lightly wooded habitats, and urban areas on the Indian subcontinent. Most species are found at low to moderate altitudes, but the Nepal gray langur and Kashmir gray langur occur up to 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) in the Himalayas.\n\n\"Hanuman\" refers to the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nSource : Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Consisting of siblings Ronny, Kenny, Larry and Yvonne, they first sang together in 1967 after being asked to sing during revival services at a small church in Freedom, California. Though they had never sung together as a unit, they soon found themselves a popular favorite in churches and concert appearances along the west coast of the United States. Initially, thy were known as The Singing Hinson Family. However, as time and their popularity progressed they became known simply as The Hinsons. Later, they were known as The Original Hinsons to distinguish themselves from Bo Hinsons' group, The New Hinsons now known as The Hinsons.\nYounger brother Larry tells the story behind the Hinsons signature song: \"It was written in 1970, in the downstairs bathroom of a church then called \"The Pentecostal Tabernacle.\" We had been rehearsing songs that Saturday evening and found the necessity to have new material to stage. Ronny disappeared for several minutes, only to return to the church sanctuary brandishing a long fluttering piece of toilet paper. The title of the song was none other than \"The Lighthouse.\" It was first recorded the next year by The Goodmans and then by The Hinsons. Songs of Calvary and Journey Music, (then owned by Rusty Goodman,) co-published the song. Elvis recorded it soon thereafter...\" 'The Lighthouse' quickly became a huge hit in southern gospel and remains one of the most recorded songs in the genre. From 1973 till 1980 The Hinsons were the co-hosts of the popular television show The Gospel Singing Jubilee. Although the Hinsons were an extremely popular touring group with excellent record sales, they were considered radical for their concert style, which was far more ministry oriented than most of the more established professional groups. Always innovators, the group recorded several albums in the mid 1970s with an eclectic mix of songs that weren't considered true southern gospel. Songs like 'Shinin' In' and 'Look what He's done for me,' had a decidedly contemporary feel, while others such as 'This Joy is Mine' had an undeniably country sound.\nThe family disbanded the group in 1988, but Larry Hinson approached their record producer at Calvary Music Group, suggesting a reunion project involving the original four founding Hinson members. They reunited one final time for One More Hallelujah which was completed in the fall of 1992. The album featured the song \"Joy Comes In The Morning,\" and spurred the 13 city One More Hallelujah Tour in 1993. The tour was cut short when lead singer, Kenny Hinson was diagnosed with kidney cancer. He died on July 27, 1995 at the age of 41.\nRonny, the eldest of the Hinson brothers, is a renowned songwriter, having written over 10 #1 songs on the southern gospel charts, and over 100 songs that charted in the top 10.

Due to Doppler effect the still receiver located ahead a source detects a sound with the greater frequency, than emitted. If detector is behind of source, then the received frequency will be lower then emitted. In the first part of animation the rings show the surfaces of equal phase in the sound wave generated by a source. We see, that ahead of a source the density of such lines is more than behind of it. Because the speed of sound relatively the media is equal in all directions, the frequency of sound ahead a source and behind of it will be different.\n\nLet's consider an object which moves with speed of sound (the plane, for example). At each moment of time it will radiate a circular sound wave. Because the speed of source coincides with speed of sound, emitted waves superpose each other and there is a jump of pressure (front of a shock wave) ahead of source as shown in second part of animation.\n\nNext let's consider a case when the source of a sound moves with supersonic speed (in animation the source moves with double speed of sound). In this case sound waves can not overtake a source and for this reason there are no sound waves before a source, they appear only behind of it. Sound waves arising behind a source superpose with each other and form in space a conic surface of high pressure. This surface is a shock wave. It is easy to show, that a sine of the angle formed by front of a shock wave with a direction of movement of a source is equal to the ratio of speed of sound to speed of source (i.e. it is the reciprocal of Mach number).\n\nhttp://physics-animations.com/", "title": "Doppler Effect and Shock Waves HD", "publishedDate": "2009-04-05T05:48:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Zu5XVIQylE", "description": "", "title": "HOUSE....RoadHOUSE", "publishedDate": "2010-01-03T05:33:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZuARpC8gAw", "description": "www.hoya.sk", "title": "Campanula in decorative pot", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T17:28:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZuLQQ94VzY", "description": "Why pregnant women have back pain and what they can do about it... http://www.screenr.com/GKBs", "title": "Causes of back pain and sciatica in pregnant women", "publishedDate": "2011-07-05T14:09:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ZuPyNM9EvY", "description": "Brian Ibarra manda este video a el concurso de Sal y Pimienta.

The station also serves nearby places including Milford on Sea, Bashley, Ashley, Hordle and Barton on Sea. The station was built in 1886 as part of the Brockenhurst to Christchurch Branch Railway which opened to traffic in 1888. It was operated by the London and South Western Railway from 1888 to 1923, by the Southern Railway from 1923 to 1948 and by British Railways from 1948, and from 1982 as part of the Network South East region. Since privatisation in 1996 it has been operated by Stagecoach Group as the South West Trains Franchise.\nWhen it was built there was some discussion on what to call the new station. Milton was suggested, as the closest place, but was discounted as there are several places in England with that name. Barton, a short distance away, was also suggested but was decided against for the same reason. It was not until the sub-postmistress set up the sub Post office across the road and called it New Milton Sub Post Office that the current name was decided on.\nServices that call here are: Weymouth semi-fast service, the Poole stopping service and trains to London Waterloo via Southampton and Basingstoke.\nThe station is able to accommodate trains of up to five coaches, longer trains only open the doors in the first five or four coaches depending on the type of unit operating the service.\nThe station is equipped with toilets, a waiting room, bicycle lockers, electronic passenger information screens, a ticket office as well as ticket machines, and has a large pay-and-display car park with 73 spaces for commuters.", "title": "New Milton, Hampshire.

I'm Yi and this is the RunList. \n\nSince chain restaurants are busy posting the calorie values for items on their menus, the folks over at Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch made a list of the highest calorie items at 10 fast food chains. For the original report, click the link in the description box below. Wanna watch a video instead? Well, we here at the RunList will do the countdown to the fattiest fast food item for you. Some are expected, while others are pretty surprising. \n\nNumber 1: Subway's Mega melt on flatbread with egg-670 calories. \n\nSubway prides itself on providing healthy sandwiches and being a healthy fast food option, and to be fair, the average six inch sub with meat range from 290 to 320 calories. However, the chain sometimes still comes up with items loaded with calories, such as this one. It's pretty big though, so if split in half and eaten as two separate meals, it's still not bad. \n\nNumber 2: Dunkin' Donuts' Frozen mocha Coffee Coolatta with Cream-730 calories.\n\nGosh, those liquid calories really get to you! Each of these coffee drinks has about 35.5 teaspoons of sugar in it. Think about it, that's only a drink and not including the food that you might decide to get with it. One chocolate coconut cake donut is 550 calories and has heaps more sugar, and come on, no one has just one donut.\n\nNumber 3: Pizza Hut's 14-inch large meat lover's pan pizza, 470 calories per slice. \nYou might think, 470 calories really isn't that bad. But in reality most of us have two or more slices, and two slices of this pie will be 940 calories. And if you have the entire pie in one sitting, which I hope not, that's a whopping 3,760 calories. \n\nNumber 4: Taco Bell's Volcanic nachos-970 calories. \nThese cheese, chili, and jalape\u00f1o topped nachos are nearly half of your suggested calorie intake. Since nachos are usually an appetizer and shared, the calorie load could be divided, and judging by the calories, it should be. \n\nNumber 5: Panera Bread's Steak and white cheddar on a French baguette-980 calories. \nHonestly, I didn't see this one coming. I frequently eat at Panera because the soup and salad image comes off as pretty healthy. But I guess not all items are. The full size of the steak and white cheddar is sneakily loaded with calories ,so you might wanna choose the apple rather than the packet of chips as the sides.\n\nNumber 6: Wendy's Dave's Hot 'N Juicy triple patty with cheese-1,120 calories.\nGood ol Wendys. The fattiest item on the standard Wendy's menu has six times more calories from fat than our recommended daily intake. Still, this doesn't compare with the Wendy's discontinued T-rex burger, which had nine patties and 3000 calories. \n\nNumber 7: KFC's 10-piece bag of original recipe chicken bites, 1,300 calories. \nSmall, but deadly. \nChicken bites are not that big, and you might just accidentally eat the whole thing without even feeling like you consumed so many calories. \n\nNumber 8: McDonald's Big Breakfast with syrup and margarine-1350 calories. \nIt's not a Big Mac, it's not even fried. The breakfast looks relatively healthy, just pancakes, sausage, and eggs. Oh, but also don't forget the biscuit, and the hash browns. Just the syrup and margarine add up 260 calories. \n\nNumber 9: Burger King's Ultimate breakfast platter-1450 calories. \nThis is pretty much exactly the same as the McDonald's one but just more! \n\nNumber 10: White Castle's 20 chicken rings-1760 calories. \nLike KFC's chicken bites, they look small and harmless, but they can really stack up. One ring is 88 calories, so keep that in mind when you decide to order a box. \n\nGee, I feel like I need to go for a run just talking about all that high calorie food! What are some of the really fatty and calorie loaded fast food items you've eaten? Also, did you change the way you eat and order food at chain restaurants now that they are required to post calorie values? Let us know in the comment section below.

They form dense tufs with hundreds of individuals, which hydrocaulli are up to 10-12 cm long. The species doesn't have a medusa in its life cycle, and gametes are produced within structures called gonophores, which stay fixed to the polyp body. Individuals are either male or female. Spermatozoa are released into the water from male gonophores, fertilizing the eggs that remain within female gonophores. Embryos develop inside female gonophores into actinula larvae, the dispersive stage of the species. A mature female polyp releases hundreds of actinulae. As you may see in the video, the actinula struggles to get free from the gonophore. It pushes several times using its tentacles; it succeeds in liberating one tentacle at a time, until it finally got out through the aperture of the gonophore. It took about 2 hours for the actinula shown in the video to get free, but this period may vary a lot. The actinula settles by its aboral end and elongates to form a juvenile polyp. It  may settle on the perisarc of adults, as is seen in the video. Newly released actinulae have aboral tentacles and rudiments of oral tentacles.\n\nReferences:\nImazu, M.A., Ale, E., Genzano, G.N. & Marques, A. C. 2014.

It is a reverential but humorous work, full of love for the cult of the Virgin Mary, which at that time also received attention from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux who was the leading medieval proponent of veneration of the Virgin as a counter-balance to the more rigorous Christian scholasticism, then the dominating spiritual force.\nUnlike Clairvaux's more sombre tomes, de Coincy's book (whilst sharing much of the same ideological bedrock) tends more towards the indulgent or soft-hearted. Many of the songs de Coincy wrote were set to popular ballads then in vogue at the royal court, or borrowed the tune of pastoral or romantic ditties. The Miracles of Our Lady is one of the most popular works of Marianist literature from the period and it encapsulates a very particular set of Christian values, which saw in the Virgin Mary the most benevolent and humanistic aspect of salvation, intercession and mercy. Many of the songs are concerned with the key elements of the Virgin's earthly life - her conception, her birth, her childhood, her youth in the Temple, the events recorded in the Biblical gospels and her Dormition; the poems and stories are generally more concerned with her modern-day miracles.\nOn the subject of the Virgin's interaction with the contemporary faithful, one modern historian describes de Coincy's view of Mary thus: -\n\"The more raffish the Virgin's suppliant, the better she likes him. The miracles' heroes are liars, thieves, adulterers, and fornicators, footloose students, pregnant nuns, unruly and lazy clerics, and eloping monks. On the single condition that they sing her praises, usually by reciting the Ave Maria, and show due respect for the miracle of the Incarnation wrought in her, they can do no [fundamental] wrong. Her justice is loyalty to her own: whatever his conduct, anyone pledged to her protection is her liegeman and she his responsible suzerain. Through her the whole gay crew of wanton, loving, weak humanity finds its way to Paradise...\" [1]\nIn many ways, de Coincy rejected the strict Pauline morality that would come to characterise later demoninations of Christianity, especially counter-Reformation Catholicism and Protestantism, which placed a great effort on self-denial and renunciation. In their immediate context, they were written to please de Coincy's own congregation and to present a softer form of Christianity in reaction to the hardline stance of the nearby cathedral-chapter at Beauvais, which had staged various plays savagely satirising secular pursuits as inherently wrong and damaging to one's spiritual life. This perhaps explain why de Coincy chose to express his own more liberal, Marianist views through the same exploitation of secular forms of presentation - in his case, poems and music.", "title": "Gautier de Coincy: Marions nous (Qui que face)", "publishedDate": "2009-10-24T12:20:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-_E9M1FOkYs", "description": "", "title": "Sower's Seminar 2014 - Worship Led by Bro.

There was minimal damage and they were able to successfully complete the mission.\"\n\nThe United States views Mali as a staunch military ally in its global campaign against terrorism, but it was believed to be the first time that the American military had actively supported a continuing Malian military operation against Tuareg insurgents.\n\nThe attack on the plane came after a joint counterterrorist exercise in the Malian desert that involved American troops and the armies of several states in the Sahel region, the band of nations just south of the Sahara.\n\n\"We had the plane in country, and when the government requested assistance to resupply food, we were able to do it,\" the embassy spokesperson said. \"The Malians provided the food.\"\n\nThe Tuaregs, a nomadic light-skinned people in northern Niger and Mali, have long complained of being neglected and marginalized by black-dominated governments ruling far away in the south, and they demand more autonomy and a greater share in their region's wealth. But the governments of Niger and Mali have dismissed them as renegades and bandits involved in trafficking arms and drugs.\n\nThe Tuaregs staged an uprising in the 1990s that ended with a treaty in 1995; a new uprising began this year. Mali's armed forces have been hunting Tuareg insurgents led by Ibrahima Bahanga.\n\nIn recent weeks the rebels have carried out several attacks and ambushes in the remote Tin-Zaouatene region. The insurgents have taken several dozen soldiers prisoner and seized vehicles and ammunition. The government also blames them for laying mines that have killed at least 13 people. Mali has appealed for international help.\n\nTuareg rebels across the border in Niger have also carried out attacks on military posts, and officials from both countries say they see links between the insurgencies.\n\nThe embassy spokesperson did not say whether the United States military would make more resupply flights for Mali's army.\n\nThe American military has been active in Africa, particularly just east of the Sahel, in the Horn of Africa. The military used an airstrip in Ethiopia to mount airstrikes against Islamic militants who had taken control of much of neighboring Somalia.\n\nThe counterterrorism effort was described by American officials as a qualified success that disrupted terrorist networks in Somalia, led to the death or capture of several Islamic militants and involved a collaborative relationship with Ethiopia that had been developing for years. .", "title": "Mali war, Rebels Fired on U.S. Military Plane Ferrying Supplies", "publishedDate": "2013-02-06T01:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-_Vc7wTa8bo", "description": "Tried some filming off the quad and it was tricky for sure\u2026. however we did capture some really great shots without it as well!

Resist the temptation to take on your boss's addiction to work -- as long as you do your job, they'll respect you for it.\n\n\nStep 1: Give and lose\nGive up time and peace of mind to outwork the boss if you have a workaholic mentality yourself. This strategy is not likely to earn you appreciation, however -- you'll most likely get used more now that the boss has found a fellow work addict.\n\nStep 2: Highlight work done\nBe disciplined and get your work done efficiently. When talking to your employer, emphasize the work you accomplish over the hours spent there. Refuse to let your boss equate those 2 factors.\n\nTip\nYou may have to get human resources involved if the boss is getting out of hand.\n\nStep 3: Set boundaries\nSet boundaries. Demonstrate your loyalty to the company in other ways, but don't feel you have to keep your boss' hours.\n\nStep 4: Anticipate trouble\nAnticipate trouble from a pushy workaholic boss and get in the habit of sending regular e-mail progress reports before they ask. Keep them busy with your e-mail updates, and you can have some room and peace as you work.\n\nStep 5: Ask about personal life\nAsk about the boss's children and family life during moments of conversation between tasks. Get to know them and attempt to find out what makes them relax.\n\nTip\nRemember that nothing you try may work in either changing them or lightening your load. The next step may be a change of jobs.\n\nStep 6: Get a life\nGet a life, even if the boss won't. Leave the job at the office so you can remain fresh and attentive with your family, recharge the batteries, and approach the next week refreshed. Don't answer calls or e-mails over the weekend -- keep your work at work!\n\nDid You Know?\nThe Japanese term for dying from overwork is karoshi, the first case of which was reported in 1969 when a 29-year-old died from a stroke.", "title": "How to Deal with a Workaholic Boss", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T22:57:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-_jajcG28M0", "description": "Silly experiment :-D", "title": "Thermocouple vs thermistor", "publishedDate": "2011-02-04T08:30:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-_kErxmgObY", "description": "Check out these new styles and more from Zappos.com!", "title": "Steve Madden Shawny  SKU:#8197226", "publishedDate": "2013-09-26T16:13:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-_lLWCEhuCA", "description": "Lauric nous montre comment R\u00e9mi danse avant la demo de celui-ci.xd", "title": "Anniversaire a Lauric.

The sail is reefed from 120sqft to 80....\n\nInspired by Arthur Ransome's books and sketches, Richard built many similar dinghies realizing that for everyone that wanted to race a National 12 or Merlin Rocket dinghy, there was probably a family who wanted to sail together in a more simply equipped boat, possibly taking the picnic and camping gear along too. (Richard also built and raced several 12s and Merlins). \n\nSciurus (a Common, or Red Squirrel in Latin) was so named as her home for many years was in Rusland, just a few hundred yards from Arthur Ransom's grave. In the 1980's the red squirrel was becoming a rare sight in the Lake District, rather like Lugsailed wooden dinghies!\n\nSciurus is well travelled... She has sailed the 70 miles overnight from Craobh Haven to Fort William to the start of the Great Glen Raid (which took another week to reach Fort Rose, another 120 miles). She travelled to Southern Sweden for the Blekinge Raid atop a VW Transporter van!  She regularly appears at traditional/wooden boat gatherings, and always performs well among significantly larger boats.\n\nOn the strength of this little film clip (thanks to John Widdaker!) Richard is confident to offer the design to other builders, along with his 18'6 design 'Scarlet' and 12'6 'Beachnut', both of which have proved themselves over the years.

Skip Tracing or Skiptracing or Skip-tracing is an informal definition that is used to describe the process of locating an individual's whereabouts.  Using modern technology to retrieve private and public information, when cross-referenced with state departmental information, it is possible to find accurate, up-to-date information on individuals or any entity.  Information could include public record information, Corporate affiliations, Bankruptcies, Credit reports, Job application information, Criminal background checks, Utility bills, Social security, Disability, Tax information, Judgments and Liens. \nFor skip tracing to be effective, it is important to verify and follow up on all data and drill down where applicable in order to uncover vital information.  Every lead must be exhausted in order to be truly effective. Digital records can hold a wealth of data, some of it useful and some of it not so useful. It is the skip tracers' job to weed through the leads, correlate and prioritize the information. A good skip-tracer can spot the hot leads and knows how to expediate the verification of the information, making the process for clients quick and effective. The best skip tracing investigators have the experience and resources to be able to distinguish between accurate leads and time wasters.\nThe World Wide Web has increased the sophistication level of effective skip tracing techniques. It wasn't long ago that people could disappear forever and be living in the next county under an alias. Today there are many avenues and lead sources that can be checked with the use of a computer. It may be easier to check social security numbers, voter registration, neighborhood inquiries, traffic ticket and marriage licenses. As more personal information is held on databases, it would seem that skip tracing has become less time consuming with a higher chance of success, but with the increase of conflicting information, it is even more crucial to employ an experienced professional to eliminate the chaff and deliver the kernels.

Addison here and today I\u2019ll be reviewing the tough and sturdy Benchmade Nimravus model 141SBK-ADC. \n\nDesigned by Allen Elisewitz, the Nimravus was developed with a lot of the same features and materials traditionally found in Benchmade folders except in a fixed blade format. Boasting a full tang construction with an overall length of 9.45\u201d and a blade measuring 4 \u00bd\u201d, the Nimravus is one heavy-duty military, combat knife. The blade of this knife is constructed of 154CM stainless steel and features a combo edge grind with a modified tanto tip. The blade of this knife is incredibly tough and is able to slice through things like thick rope, heavy strap, heavy hose, batton through wood and basically handle any outdoor chore with relative ease! The unique tanto tip also allows the blade to puncture through tough materials such as thin metal and thick plastic. The handle of this knife is composed of OD green anodized aluminum, which features great texturing and a convenient finger guard. An ACU nylon sheath comes included with this knife, which can be worn on your belt but is also MOLLE compatible for a variety of carrying options.     \n\nOverall, the Benchmade Nimravus is the perfect military and combat knife. Its full tang construction, tough blade steel, unique handle material and versatile sheath make this knife ideal for field use. The blade\u2019s combo edge also provides you with a variety of cutting options that can handle just about any material you put in its path. The general design and durability of the knife make it perfect for heavy-duty combat use and I highly recommend it to those of you who want a rough and rugged fixed blade knife with all the features of Benchmade\u2019s premium folders. \n\nWe here at KnifeHog give this knife a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars. \n\nComment in the section below and tell us what you think about this knife.

Our discussions are straightforward on any issue - be it the Ukraine crisis or anything else. Sometimes I am hopeful that our signal has been heard but unfortunately it's not always followed up by action. We actively worked together during the active phase of the Ukraine crisis, it was in April, and the outcome of the efforts was the Geneva declaration signed by Ukraine, Russia, the US and the EU which outlined the key provisions for a settlement. It was agreed that Ukraine should immediately launch an inclusive dialogue involving all the political groups and regions to pursue a constitutional reform that would ensure the interests of all Ukrainians are respected. Ukraine signed up to it but the process didn't start at that point. And it was only in September that together with the EU leaders we managed to persuade the Ukrainian authorities to sit down at the negotiating table with the militia forces. And since then we've seen some relative success. People may still be dying, but not as many as before, and the shelling became less intense. The disengagement process is underway, heavy weaponry is being withdrawn 15km away from the separation line, and the OSCE mission is going to monitor the ceasefire.\"\nW/S Journalist speaking to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\n\nSCRIPT\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gave an interview on the concluded UN General Assembly in New York on Saturday. During the interview Lavrov spoke of the relationship between Russia and the US, calling it \"solid.\" However, the praise was followed by criticism, with Lavrov arguing conversations between the two are not \"always followed up by actions.\"\n\nLavrov also addressed the Ukraine crisis, stating that recent negotiations have thus far been a success. He added that heavy weaponry has been removed from the separation line and the OSCE continues to monitor the ceasefire. \n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/Ruptly\nLiveLeak: http://www.liveleak.com/c/Ruptly\nGoogle Plus: http://google.com/+RuptlyTV\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/Ruptly\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/RuptlyTV\nDailyMotion: http://www.dailymotion.com/ruptly\nVideo on Demand: http://www.ruptly.tv", "title": "US: Russia and US have \u201csolid\u201d communication, says Lavrov", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T14:20:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "-aW2DmztgK0", "description": "", "title": "Une Femme accouche d'un Serpent au Niger", "publishedDate": "2013-01-03T18:40:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-aW7NFSGklM", "description": "Subscribe to Ninja Tune on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/ninja000?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTaken from The Bug's 'Poison Dart' EP - released 26th November 2007 on Ninja Tune.\n\nBuy Part 1 & 2 at the Ninjashop: http://bit.ly/RSvyWL / http://bit.ly/RSx0IG\nDownload on iTunes: http://glnk.it/1v8 \n\nDownload Ninja Jamm, the new remix app from Ninja Tune, FREE via the App Store: http://www.itunes.com/apps/ninjajamm\n\nhttp://www.ninjatune.net", "title": "The Bug - Poison Dart feat.

They have reduced or absent pelvic and caudal fins, giving them an eel-like appearance, and large fang-like teeth.[1]\nSome of the species are known as scabbardfishes or hairtails or Walla Walla; others are called frostfishes because they appear in late autumn and early winter, around the time of the first frosts.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\n\u30bf\u30c1\u30a6\u30aa Trichiurus lepturus\uff08\u592a\u5200\u9b5a\u3001\u7acb\u9b5a\u3001\u82f1: Largehead hairtail\uff09\u306f\u3001\u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u76ee\u30b5\u30d0\u4e9c\u76ee\u30bf\u30c1\u30a6\u30aa\u79d1\u306b\u5c5e\u3059\u308b\u9b5a\u985e\u3002\u5225\u540d\u306b\u30bf\u30c1\u30ce\u30a6\u30aa\u3001\u30bf\u30c1\u3001\u30cf\u30af\u30ca\u30ae\u3001\u30cf\u30af\u30a6\u30aa\u3001\u30b5\u30ef\u30d9\u30eb\u3001\u30b7\u30e9\u30ac\u306a\u3069\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002\u7a2e\u3005\u306e\u8abf\u7406\u6cd5\u3067\u98df\u7528\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u5a2f\u697d\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u91e3\u308a\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u3068\u3082\u306a\u308b\u3002\u56de\u904a\u9b5a\u3002\n\u65e5\u672c\u8fd1\u6d77\u306b\u5206\u5e03\u3059\u308b\u30bf\u30c1\u30a6\u30aa\u306f\u304b\u3064\u3066\u4ed6\u306e\u5730\u57df\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3068\u5225\u7a2e\u3042\u308b\u3044\u306f\u5225\u4e9c\u7a2e\u3068\u3055\u308c\u3001Trichiurus japonicus\u3001\u3042\u308b\u3044\u306fT. lepturus japonicus\u306e\u5b66\u540d\u304c\u5f53\u3066\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u3053\u308c\u3092\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6771\u5cb8\u306b\u5206\u5e03\u3059\u308b T. nitens \u306a\u3069\u3068\u3068\u3082\u306b\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u6c34\u57df\u306b\u751f\u606f\u3059\u308b T. lepturus \u3068\u3059\u3079\u3066\u540c\u7a2e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6271\u3046\u5834\u5408\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002", "title": "Cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) \u30bf\u30c1\u30a6\u30aa(\u592a\u5200\u9b5a\u3001\u7acb\u9b5a)", "publishedDate": "2011-03-16T13:04:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-aX45GCZzVY", "description": "Learn how to sculpt the face of a clay horse head sculpture in this free ceramic art video lesson.\n\nExpert: Jorge Benlloch\nBio: Jorge Benlloch is originally from Barcelona, Spain, where he received a M.A. & B.A in art at Steban Ripeaux Academy.\nFilmmaker: Nili Nathan", "title": "How to Make a Horse Head Sculpture : Sculpting the Face of a Horse Head: Part 1", "publishedDate": "2008-01-22T22:25:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-aX_YZGXHlM", "description": "Removing a Ganglion Cyst is a piece of cake.

Al di sotto di questa, \u00e8 presente una seconda fascia rosso brillante,dal centro del corpo fino al peduncolo caudale. Il ventre \u00e8 argenteo, le pinne trasparenti. \nMolto simile d'aspetto al Cardinale o Cheirodon axelrodi, essendo entrambi caratterizzati da una striscia fortemente rifrangente, tanto da sembrare luminosa. Si distingue dal Cheirodon axelrodi per la banda rossa che inizia a met\u00e0 del corpo e le pinne pi\u00f9 sviluppate (nel Neon), globalmente il neon appare pi\u00f9 \"luminoso\" del cardinale. Pacifico pesce, abbastanza vivace che andrebbe allevato in gruppi di 10 esemplari con pesci pacifici di uguale taglia anche in vasche di piccole dimensioni (almeno 30 litri di capienza). Se non \u00e8 tenuto in branchi di 6-8 specie diventa molto timido.\n\nIl Neon, carnivoro in natura, in acquario accetta qualunque mangime commerciale sia in scaglie sia in granuli. E' importante offrirgli una alimentazione completa e varia, comprendente anche alimento vivo (ad es. larve di Zanzara), in quanto solo integrando alimenti vivi nella sua dieta si otterranno esemplari sani, longevi e idonei alla riproduzione.\n\n\n-LITRAGGIO E AMBIENTAZIONE\n\nVisto e considerato che questi pescolini vivono in branchi, e quindi minimo una decina di esemplari, consiglio di allevarli in un acquario di 60-70 litri minimo. Quest'ultimo deve avere un buon filtraggio e vi consiglio di cambiare il 10% di acqua ogni settimana e mezza. L'arredamento dovrebbe prevedere fondo con colorazione piuttosto scura ed una fitta vegetazione lungo la parete posteriore e su quelle laterali della vasca, con ampi spazi liberi al centro per il nuoto.L'illuminazione non dovrebbe mai essere eccessivamente intensa e si pu\u00f2 eventualmente \"schermare\" con piante galleggianti.\n\n-RIPRODUZIONE E DIMORFISMO SESSUALE\n\nSimile a quella del cardinale. La coppia inizia i giochi amorosi e si isola dal branco. L'acqua deve avere una durezza non superiore a 5 \u00b0 dGH, Temperatura intorno ai 25 \u00b0C, illuminazione ridotta al minimo. Le uova (fino a 500) vengono deposte tra le foglie di muschi e piante acquatiche, al termine i genitori si allontanano rapidamente. I minuscoli avannotti si nutrono con infusori. Importante la quasi completa assenza di luce, mal tollerata dalle uova.\nIl dimorfismo sessuale non \u00e8 evidente; la femmina tuttavia ha corporatura pi\u00f9 robusta e ventre tondeggiante.\n\n\n*Scheda presa dal web", "title": "Scheda Paracheirodon innesi (Neon)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-18T21:14:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "-abFh8_kICg", "description": "Music video by Deitrick Haddon performing Well Done.

However, many people experience an unpleasant soapy taste or a rank smell and avoid the leaves.\n The flavours have also been compared to those of the stink bug, and similar chemical groups are involved (aldehydes). The different perceptions of the coriander leaves' taste is likely genetic, with some people having no response to the aromatic chemical that most find pleasant, while simultaneously being sensitive to certain offending unsaturated aldehydes.\n\n\n3.67 g\nSugars 0.87\nDietary fiber 2.8 g\nFat\n0.52 g\nProtein\n2.13 g\nVitamins\nVitamin A equiv.\nbeta-carotene\nlutein zeaxanthin\n(42%) 337 \u03bcg\n(36%) 3930 \u03bcg\n865 \u03bcg\nThiamine (B1) (6%) 0.067 mg\nRiboflavin (B2) (14%) 0.162 mg\nNiacin (B3) (7%) 1.114 mg\nPantothenic acid (B5)\n(11%) 0.57 mg\nVitamin B6 (11%) 0.149 mg\nFolate (B9) (16%) 62 \u03bcg\nVitamin C (33%) 27 mg\nVitamin E (17%) 2.5 mg\nVitamin K (295%) 310 \u03bcg\nTrace metals\nCalcium (7%) 67 mg\nIron (14%) 1.77 mg\nMagnesium (7%) 26 mg\nManganese (20%) 0.426 mg\nPhosphorus (7%) 48 mg\nPotassium (11%) 521 mg\nSodium (3%) 46 mg\nZinc (5%) 0.5 mg\nOther constituents\nWater 92.21 g\nLink to USDA Database entry\nUnits\n\u03bcg = micrograms \u2022 mg = milligrams\nIU = International units\nPercentages are roughly approximated using US recommendations for adults.\nSource: USDA Nutrient Database\nCoriander (Coriandrum sativum), also known as cilantro, Chinese parsley or dhania, is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. Coriander is native to regions spanning from southern Europe and North Africa to southwestern Asia. It is a soft plant growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the centre of the umbel longer (5--6 mm or 0.20--0.24 in) than those pointing toward it (only 1--3 mm or 0.039--0.118 in long). The fruit is a globular, dry schizocarp 3--5 mm (0.12--0.20 in) in diameter. Although sometimes eaten alone, the seeds often are used as a spice or an added ingredient in other foods.\nCoriandre coriandre organique \n\"Coriandre\" redirige ici.

So does it make sense to compare the two?\n\nWell, it does. The Indian car buyer does not always differentiate between the two, and the primary objective of the SUV buyer is to car around 7 people - something he shares with the Indian MPV buyer. But he also wants the macho image that an SUV offers. The Tata Aria offers itself to these buyers with the proposition that it is cheaper, it is also 4x4, has deent ground clearance, and has more features and creature comforts than the Ford Endeavour. The combination of factors, Tata hopes, will tilt the scales in its favour.\n\nWe find that there is some substance to the claims of Tata Aria in this video comparison. Sure, if you want extreme SUV and offroading capabilities, you will need the Endeavour, and for image. But if most of your driving is on roads and you would take the vehicle off road only occasionally, you should take a close look at the Tata Aria.\n\nVisit http://www.CarToq.com to ask questions about any car in India to Indian car owners and experts!", "title": "Ford Endeavour 4x4 AT vs Tata Aria 4x4 Pride Comparison, Ford Endeavour advice for Indian car buyers", "publishedDate": "2012-03-21T10:54:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ahHjVXRqZQ", "description": "", "title": "Kanye West - Know The Game [The Prerequisite]", "publishedDate": "2013-04-27T10:32:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ahLbx1q5jA", "description": "From what comes in the box, to set up, to ready to use, watch this video to learn about the easiness of the CamRanger to be able to wirelessly control your Canon or Nikon qualified camera.", "title": "CamRanger Tutorial Part 1", "publishedDate": "2013-04-09T14:04:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ahhkk_VOL4", "description": "#foxbirba\u015fkag\u00fczel\nhttp://www.fox.com.tr/index/anasayfa", "title": "FOX yeni sezon tan\u0131t\u0131m\u0131", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T14:47:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ai7rgyxfRc", "description": "Twitch the King of Clubs ft.

I had to stop and ask myself; if a man was the author of the Qur'an, how could he have written facts in the seventh century AD, that today are shown to be in keeping with modern scientific knowledge?\n\nThere was absolutely no doubt about it, the text of the Qur'an we have today is most definitely a text of the period, if I may be allowed to put it in these terms. What human explanation can there be for this observation? In my opinion there is no explanation; there is no special reason why an inhabitant of the Arabian Peninsula should, at a time when King Dagobert was reigning in France (629-639 AD) have had scientific knowledge on certain subjects that was ten centuries ahead of our own.\" \n\n \nA famous French oceanographer, Jacques Cousteau, gives the following account as a result of his studies in water barriers: \n\n\"We studied the assertions by certain researchers about barriers separating seas, and noticed that the Mediterranean Sea had its own salinity and density and housed autochthonous fauna and flora. Then we examined the water of the Atlantic Ocean and discovered features entirely different from those of the Mediterranean Sea. According to our expectations, these two seas that merged in the strait of Gibraltar should present similar characteristics in terms of salinity, density and other properties. The two seas presented different features even though they were adjacent. This greatly puzzled us. An incredible barrier prevented the two seas from coming together. The same sort of a barrier had also been observed in Bab Al-Mandab in the Gulf of Aden connecting with the Red Sea. \n\nSubsequent to our observations, further researchers made it clear that the seas which had different characteristics had some barriers.\" \n\nThis fact that astounded oceanographers was revealed 14 centuries ago in the Quran. This aspect, not visible to the naked eye and appearing to be in conflict with the properties of water known to man, was first revealed to men in the Arabian peninsula, men who were not at all experienced in any sense with oceanography.\n\n\n\"He has let free the two bodies of flowing water, meeting together: \n\nBetween them is a barrier which they do not transgress.\" \n\n(Qur'an, Ar-Rahman 55:19-20)", "title": "J.

Succinic acid, as a platform chemical, is growing in demand in various applications. However, consumption of petroleum based succinic acid, as an intermediate, in manufacturing various chemicals, is limited due to its volatility of price and carbon footprints. These concerns led to the discovery of biological manufacturing of succinic acid. The bio succinic acid market is forecast to grow at a significant rate over the next seven years. The major drivers for this growth will be volatility in fossil fuel prices, rise in carbon footprints, and an interest in using locally available raw materials. Furthermore, increasing global demand of green chemicals will trigger its adoption in wide range of applications, especially, in bio plastics, making it a strong platform chemical.\n\nRead Complete Report with TOC: http://www.researchbeam.com/bio-succinic-acid-market\n\nBio succinic acid is primarily being used as a replacement for petrol based succinic acid in few applications such as solvents and lubricants, de-icer solutions, cosmetics, food and pharma. Furthermore, newer application such as 1,4-Butanediol (BDO), PBS, plasticizers and polyesters polyols market will accelerate the future growth of the market. Additionally, higher cost of crude oil, increase in investments for green chemicals, demand for renewable chemicals, and increase in government support will further boost the growth of the market. However, higher price of bio succinic acid and lengthy extraction processes are primarily restraining the market growth for the next few years. The global bio based succinic acid market is expected to reach market volume of 710.0 kilo tons by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 45.6% during 2013-2020.\n\nTo Get Sample Copy of Report visit @ http://www.researchbeam.com/bio-succinic-acid-market/request-sample\n\nVarious industrial application markets analyzed in the study includes BDO, polyester polyols, PBS, plasticizers, resins, coatings, & pigments, solvents & lubricants, alkyd resins, and de-icer solutions. The resins, coatings, & pigments market generated maximum revenue in the year 2013. However, seven years down the line, BDO is expected to emerge as the largest application segment. This is largely due to higher consumption of bio succinic acid in the production of BDO, as a replacement of maleic anhydride. It is estimated that 1.2 MT of bio succinic acid is needed to replace 1 MT of maleic anhydride.\n\nTable Of Content\n\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION\n 1.1 Key benefits\n 1.2 Key deliverables\n 1.3 Key Audiences\n 1.4 Research methodology\n    1.4.1 Secondary research\n    1.4.2 Primary research\n    1.4.3 Analyst tools and models\nCHAPTER 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCHAPTER 3 GLOBAL BIO SUCCINIC ACID MARKET OVERVIEW\n 3.1 Market Definition and Scope\n 3.2 Bio-succinic acid support reducing carbon footprint and add value proposition as compared to petrol-succinic acid\n 3.3 Addressable market of bio succinic acid\n    3.3.1 Maleic Anhydride\n    3.3.2 Adipic acid\n    3.3.3 Phthalic anhydride\n 3.4 Blueprint for commercialization success\n    3.4.1 Challenges for commercializing bio succinic acid\n 3.5 Various bio-succinic acid plants with its capacities based in major economies\n    3.5.1 BioAmber\n    3.5.2 BASF-PURAC (Succinity)\n    3.5.3 Reverdia\n    3.5.4 Myriant\n 3.6 Market intelligence\n    3.6.1 Top factors impacting bio succinic acid market\n    3.6.2 Top winning strategies in the bio succinic acid market\n    3.6.3 Top investment pockets in bio succinic acid market\n       3.6.3.1 Bio succinic acid market -- By industrial Applications\n       3.6.3.2 Bio succinic acid market -- By Geography\n 3.7 Value chain analysis", "title": "Global Bio Succinic Acid Market Size, Trends, Analysis, Research, Report, Forecast 2013 - 2020", "publishedDate": "2014-06-21T18:42:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-atUV67dArw", "description": "September is a time to increase public awareness of Leukemia, Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Lymphoma as well as Childhood Cancer.

The consequences of war hang like loose sinews over everything, waiting to be tied up. The new season is both structurally and thematically about the exponentially multiplying ramifications of violence. (One of the new characters, Oberyn Martell, shows up at King's Landing for Joffrey's wedding on a mission to extract revenge from the Lannisters for what they did to his sister in the last civil war. From the big picture point of view, the few decades of peace of the Baratheon era are just a blip in an ongoing dynastic struggle, the Weimer era of Westeros.) Once peace and order are shattered, how does society, family, basic human decency get restored? The shows' dozens of protagonists, scattered across fictional lands, have no answers.\n\nSeason 4 is based on the second half of the third book in Martin's planned seven-book series, which is to say we are, dramatically, not even halfway there. The players and the plot are still moving out from the center. Daenerys and her increasingly large dragons are still on the other side of the world, flirting with handsome mercenaries and conquering slave societies. Jon Snow is up in the North, readying the Wall for a war with the Wildling army, which now includes cannibals. Arya and the Hound are on an ultra-violent walkabout that also provides occasional comic relief; Stannis is sacrificing people to the Lord of Light; the Lannisters sit in King's Landing, infighting and scheming and engaging, as ever, in tawdry sexposition.\n\nThe first episode hastily re-establishes that the things that are great about Game of Thrones are the same as what is frustrating about it. Game of Thrones does world building and character creation at a level of detail unparalleled anywhere on television. (It remains an impossible show to start midway through.) Shot in multiple far-flung locations, with seemingly hundreds if not thousands of extras, it unfurls at such a scale that its characters\u2014however high-powered\u2014stay in perspective: They are always small, human-sized.\n\nBut due to all this ambitious sprawl, Game of Thrones only occasionally puts together a satisfying standalone episode. There is too much going on, the one-hour limit too arbitrary. Except for those episodes dedicated to one seriously traumatic event, like the Red Wedding or the Battle of Blackwater, story is always leaking out the sides. In the season opener, we are shuffled from character to character, given not enough of some, too much of others. (If I ever see Bran again before his visions finally add up to something, it will be too soon.) The ideal Game of Thrones viewing experience would be a massive, near hundred-episode binge watch when the show is finished. If you, like me, don't have the patience for that, then week to week you put up with a show in which each episode is designed with no concern for your satisfaction.\n\nThe new season gains momentum as it goes forward, horror begetting more horror. Characters who mean well make bad choices or are punished for crimes they didn't commit. Characters too weak to fight for themselves are used, abused, kidnapped. Characters capable of decency give into revenge, rape, mercilessness. It's the particular power of Game of Thrones that as these characters descend further into the muck and the grime, the besmirching totality of violence, we're still pulling for so many of them.

One good popular way is to have a good look at their diet and what they are eating. Although just a good diet in itself will not be sufficient enough to get rid of fibroid, but it is an extremely important part of the overall strategy for shrinking fibroids or keeping them away.\n\nThe starting point is obviously the food you eat. There are certain foods that will curb the growth of fibroids and others that will promote their growth. The key is to separate these two foods and include only those that are going to be of benefit to you. Stick with the components of a general healthy diet, whether you have fibroids or not.\n\nHere are some of the main foods that help shrink fibroids.\n\nWater\nKeep your body well hydrated and drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water each day. This will ensure that you body is free of toxins and liver is clean of any pollutants.  Not drinking enough water lets harmful chemicals to get stored in our tissues and lead to formation of fibroids.\n\nOrganic food\nAlways eat organic food that is free of any pesticides and harmful chemicals that can lead to an imbalance of hormones in our body and thus cause these fibroids to develop. Eat whole grains, fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds etc. It is best to eat fruits with their skins on. Eating from a wide variety of fruits is the best approach. Likewise, include salads in your daily meals. Onions and garlic are excellent sources of antioxidants that keep female hormones in balance.

Really, a popular tree throughout North America but so far amongst the Central Coast this is one of our most popular feature trees.\n\nSo in this case I want to point out that there are more than 450 varieties of green and red Japanese Maple, hybrids like you wouldn't believe.\n\nThis one here is one of my favorites, this is called a garnet. But notice, here we are, summer months, a little bit of browning on the tips. Why is that the case? you ask.. Well as soon as summer hits the lush spring foliage gets hit with sun and wind and you see this in almost all Japanese Maples. So how do you over come it?\n\nWell that's where Wilt Stop comes in, this is a natural product that will last for 6 to 8 weeks, it's made of Pine Resin so coming into summer, you get it ready and you apply a little bit to your Japanese Maple and it's like Sunscreen for the Japanese Maple. Applied correctly it will actually prevent those brown tips.\n\nThis will also help with frost as well. This will give you 4 or 5 degrees of protection on tender subtropicals when you know a frost will hit. \n\nBut when it comes to Japanese Maples, see your local nursery. They are going to have a much better selection than one of the box stores. Plus the know how on how to plant it and make sure you succeed at it.\n\nThanks for tuning in.\n\nPlant a Japanese Maple and come summer, think about something like Wilt Stop.\n\nMcShane's Nursery and Landscape Supply Copyright 2010\nLandon Wolf Copyright 2010", "title": "How To Care For Your Japanese Maple Trees", "publishedDate": "2010-06-26T02:24:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b8FqtIMv2g", "description": "(Truy\u1ec1n h\u00ecnh VTC14) - H\u01a1n 30.000 tr\u1ebb ph\u1ea3i ho\u00e3n ti\u00eam v\u1eafc xin s\u1edfi \u2013 rubella\nLi\u00ean quan \u0111\u1ebfn vi\u1ec7c t\u1ed5 ch\u1ee9c chi\u1ebfn d\u1ecbch ti\u00eam ch\u1ee7ng m\u1edf r\u1ed9ng tr\u00ean to\u00e0n qu\u1ed1c v\u1eafc xin S\u1edfi - Rubella, B\u1ed9 Y t\u1ebf cho bi\u1ebft, \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 757.561 tr\u1ebb \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ti\u00eam ch\u1ee7ng  lo\u1ea1i v\u1eafc xin n\u00e0y, b\u00ean c\u1ea1nh \u0111\u00f3, c\u00f3 30.094 tr\u1ebb ph\u1ea3i ho\u00e3n ti\u00eam.", "title": "VTC14_H\u01a1n 30.000 tr\u1ebb ph\u1ea3i ho\u00e3n ti\u00eam v\u1eafc xin s\u1edfi \u2013 rubella", "publishedDate": "2014-10-09T13:56:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b8KUjw3Vw8", "description": "Explication simple du principe de fonctionnement de l'ampoule \u00e0 incandescence", "title": "L'ampoule \u00e0 incandescence", "publishedDate": "2011-07-14T10:55:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b8YbN7hUKw", "description": "the moon changing phases on July 22, 2013 Synodic Month", "title": "Moon changing phases 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-06-24T09:57:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b8hD6hbnkI", "description": "The pale tussock caterpillar transforms into a common moth on the estate.

Set for release June 5, The Industrialist is the second album written by vocalist Burton C. Bell and guitarist Dino Cazares since reuniting in 2009 after a seven-year split. An audio snippet for the album's lead single, \"Recharger,\" is now available at the band's official YouTube page; the single is available via iTunes, Amazon and other online retailers beginning April 24.\n\nAs previously announced, The Industrialist is a conceptual record based around a short fiction written by Bell; lyrics to the album's ten songs divulge the narrative as discussed recently by Bell with Decibel Magazine. The album will be available on three formats -- standard CD, a limited edition deluxe digi-book (featuring two additional songs), and 180-gram double vinyl. Pre-orders for the album in all formats will be available shortly via Candlelight Records' official webstore.\n\nBell notes, \"the protagonist (The Industrialist) is the incarnation of all industries in the form of an automaton. The mechanical, technological, and scientific advances through the industrial age led to the creation of The Industrialist. In the story, the automaton becomes sentient as it collects memories with each passing day. Through observation and learning, it gains the will to exist. What was meant to help man, will eventually be man's demise.\"\n\nThe Industrialist follows the 2010 release of Mechanize. Widely regarded, the album was the first release from FEAR FACTORY in six years. Mechanize debuted on Billboard's Top 100 album chart week of release and topped CMJ's Loud Rock radio chart as programmers embraced the band's triumphant return. Sirius XM and Headbangers Ball's host Jose Mangin noted, \"after Mechanize dominated 2010 as Liquid Metal's Album Of The Year, North America is chompin' at the bit to get an ear full of new Fear Factory. I have no doubt that FEAR FACTORY are going to kick our collective asses in 2012.\"\n\nMembers of FEAR FACTORY are currently in Los Angeles rehearsing for upcoming performances in South America followed by their first U.S. tour since late 2010. Bell and Cazares presented members of Slipknot the \"Comeback Of The Year\" award last week at the 4th Annual Revolver Golden God Awards; an award they were nominated for in 2010. Xbox broadcast the program, including pre-ceremony black carpet interviews, to all game console owners; Revolver Magazine streamed the event live via their Facebook page. Rebroadcast information will be announced by Revolver Magazine shortly.\n\nDates on FEAR FACTORY's upcoming American tour are noted below.\n5/01/2012 Backstage Live -- San Antonio, TX\n5/02/2012 Trees -- Dallas, TX\n5/03/2012 Scout Bar -- Houston, TX\n5/05/2012 State Theater -- St. Petersburg, FL\n5/06/2012 Culture Room -- Ft.

Trivit'as Nopalea is an all natural health alternative in fighting the chronic pain from inflammation and silent inflammation.\n\nWe often make medicine a lot more complex than it really is. We see chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, alzheimer's as separate diseases. However, in reality, they are just simply different manifestations of inflammation. We know about classic inflammation, when we feel pain, that's why you go see a Doctor. However, we now know that there is a second type of inflammation, silent inflammation. Silent inflammation  is inflammation that goes below the perception of pain, and since there is no pain, there is nothing to stop it. This type of inflammation can attack your organs every cell in your organs, over periods of years if not decades. Until there is enough internal organ damage that is called, chronic disease.\n\nNow, how do you know if you havesilent inflammation? There is a blood test, but if you are like me, you probably hate to take blood tests. Is there any other indication that you may have high levels of silent inflammation? There's no one factor, but there is a litany of questions you can ask, and if you can answer yes to 3 or more of these questions its quite likely you have high levels of silent inflammation.\n\nThe first question is, Are you overweight? Well there are 2/3 of Americans right there. Another question might be.. Are you taking cholesterol lowering drugs like statins?\nAre you taking drugs for hypertension like beta blockers or diuretics?\nAre you constantly groggy from wakening?\nAre you constantly craving carbohydrates throughout the day?\nAre you fatigued throughout the day?\nAre your fingernails brittle?\n\nIf you can answer yes to 3 or more of these questions, you probably have high levels of silent inflammation.\n\nThere's no drug known to science that can reverse silent inflammation but there are natural properties in the Nopal cactus that can. Those who have incorporated Nopalea, a natural juice derived from the whole nopal cactus, included in their diet have seen significant reductions in silent inflammation and chronic inflammation. Controlling that, opens up your pathway for wellness.\n\nFor information on fighting silent inflammation get the free report at http://www.siteproweb.com/the-secret-killer-free-report\n\nTake your wellness challenge at http://www.nopalea-superfruit.com\n\nLearn more about Nopalea at http://www.nopaleasuperfruit.com", "title": "Trivita Nopalea Anti-Inflammation Natural Health Alternative", "publishedDate": "2010-08-18T15:56:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-bFVruLyVeQ", "description": "The poor and immodest way in which people dress, especially while attending Holy Mass has become deplorable.

To knowingly and intentionally dress like this is sinful and can easily be seriously sinful. Because one becomes a temptation for sin, to sin for other people.

Then a fierce clash erupted May 20, 2007, that pitted the national army against a surprising foe: a little-known militant group comprising hundreds of fighters firmly entrenched in the Palestinian camp at Nahr al-Bared.\n\nThe battle raged for 15 weeks, scattering the camp's 31,000 residents and shocking a fearfully divided nation. When the fighting ended Sept. 2, it had claimed hundreds of lives, leveled most of the camp and stretched the army perilously thin. In a country where Palestinians are still blamed for triggering the last civil war, it had raised the grim possibility that violence could spread to 11 similar camps. 'Post-Annapolis' discussions on the prospects for Palestinian statehood largely ignore the fate of Lebanon's 400,000 Palestinians. But the untold stories behind the rise of Fatah al-Islam, the ongoing displacement of Nahr al-Bared's two-time refugees and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the government will do about the dismal conditions and shifting alliances within the camps, will help determine the region's future.\n\nThis report is part of Pulitzer Center-sponsored project \"Refuge in Ruin: Returning to Nahr al-Bared\" (http://bit.ly/sFCqO3).", "title": "Shelled Apartment in Nahr al-Bared", "publishedDate": "2008-01-05T18:32:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-bYyyn5ohvc", "description": "An Energizer representative does an overview of their New Energizer Carabineer light at the 2011 Shot Show.", "title": "Energizer Carabineer Light Overview Shot Show 2011", "publishedDate": "2011-01-20T19:38:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-bZ7hePaKTw", "description": "Most pregnant women opt for a vaginal delivery.

Instead of passing electricity through a coil to create a magnetic force, you can pass a magnet through a coil to generate electro-motive force--that is, electricity flowing through the wire. The moving magnetic field interacts with electrons and pushes them around. This principle is used in the generation of electricity in power stations everywhere in the world. \n\nSuppose we imagine a loop of wire becoming a closed ring of metal. Now imagine that the ring is stretched to become a tube. Moving a magnet through the tube still pushes the electrons around, although now they are just running in circles. These circulations are called eddy currents.\n\nFor a dramatic demonstration of the consequences, all you have to do is drop a powerful magnet through a tube made of metal that is nonmagnetic but is a good electrical conductor. Copper or aluminum will do the job. The magnet behaves as if it's falling through molasses. Nothing visible is preventing it from falling freely, but its interaction with electrons in the tube requires energy, and the energy is obtained by stealing it from the pull of gravity.\n\nEven this is not the whole story. Electrons flowing through a conductor will generate some heat. This is the principle which causes a fuse to blow if too much current flows through it, as the fuse gets hot and melts. \n\nVery little heat is created if the conductor has a low resistance--but still, the heat is there. Therefore the work that is done by gravity, pulling a magnet through a tube, is converted partially into heat. Energy, as always, is conserved.\n\nIn the days when I was learning about electricity and magnetism, I never saw the tube-and-magnet demo. Aluminum was costly back then, and simple iron magnets were not very powerful. A neodymium magnet is necessary to create a significant, dramatic effect. These are the strongest known type of magnets, developed collaboratively by General Motors and Hitachi in the 1980s. \n\nSee http://boingboing.net/2014/05/13/magnet.html", "title": "Spherical Magnet Through an Aluminum Tube, Part 1", "publishedDate": "2014-05-13T00:37:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-bZxYm8SY-w", "description": "", "title": "Adding Tool Links to a Course Menu", "publishedDate": "2013-11-27T06:04:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b_4cEAJrWA", "description": "\u00a9 2009 WMG\nSe non ami", "title": "Nek - Se non ami (videoclip)", "publishedDate": "2010-09-30T18:49:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "-b_LAIMuMxQ", "description": "Home Wrecker: Destroy the Planetary Fortress in the \"Old Soldiers\" mission before the nuclear strike on Hard difficulty.\n\nThis achievement is a little technical in its execution.

The series revolves around the lives of two friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigby\u2014both employed as groundskeepers at a local park.

They work as groundskeepers at a park and spend their days trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means.[3]This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson\u2014a gumball machine and their coworker Skips\u2014a yeti, but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops\u2014a man with a lollipop for a head. Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost, and an intern goat called Thomas.[4] Mordecai often visits a local coffee house to talk to the waitress, a red breasted robin called Margaret\u2013upon whom he has a crush.\nSonic the Hedgehog  is a platform video game developed by Sonic Teamand published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

Instead of using chemical pesticides to control these bruchids, this animation shows the use of hermetic sealing of plastic bags (triple bagging) to minimize pest damage over long-term (multiple months) storage of the cowpea seeds. This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

It is important to live a wholesome and fulfilling life, but one can't let perspiration get in the way of those aspirations. Excessive sweating is a problem because it may ruin relationships between people.  \nExtra Dry is the latest innovation in the treatment of perspiration. Our advertisement identifies that perspiration inhibits many different aspect of our lives.  Extra Dry can help solve these problems that arise - both at work place, and in one's social life. With daily usage, Extra Dry can help reduce the embarrassment caused by excessive sweating, boost one's confidence, and help our patients live a normal life. \nOur group discussed how to relate with the consumer. At first we narrated the commercial in first person, but then decided to narrate in the third person to help reiterate some of the issues that come with sweating. We used Geoff as a doctor to gain the consumers' trust, and to formally introduce Extra Dry as a credible and approved drug. Ali showed the consumer what its like to live with his uncontrollable sweating condition. This allows us to see how it affects multiple aspects of his life. Diana and Sarah acted as the girls who felt the negative effects of Alis sweating condition; they also testified towards the success of the drug. Last but not least, Jill led the directing and the producing of the video.

A newspaper report at the time said the Ferrari careered off the track and flipped twice after a tyre burst.\n\nThe car was repaired by Ferrari in Italy and was sold to Italian gentleman driver Paolo Colombo in time for the start of the 1963 competition season.\n\nIn 1965 young Fabrizio Violati, the scion of a wealthy Italian family, bought the car. \"I saved the car from scrap and hid it from my parents. I only drove it at night so nobody would see me\", Bonhams quoted him as saying.\n\nFor almost 40 more years, Violati drove the Ferrari in classic car and historic racing events, and it became one of the last 250 GTOs to compete regularly into the 2000s, until his death in 2010, the auction house said.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntdtv.tv\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Ferraris 38 million dollar sale sets car auction record", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T18:22:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cCFLB5HSTo", "description": "88\u6b72\u5916\u5a46\u5531\u65e5\u6587\u6b4c\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u4f34\u5531\u8005~\u5927\u8205", "title": "\u963f\u5b24\u5531\u6b4c~\u6eff\u5dde\u59d1\u5a18", "publishedDate": "2009-01-28T18:02:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cCPFHstl9A", "description": "Music video by L.L.

Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), Freedonia's principal benefactress, will lend the country 20 million dollars if the president withdraws and places the government in the hands of the \"fearless, progressive\" Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). At his inauguration, Firefly shows up late, insults everyone in sight, and sings a song about how he intends to abuse his power. Naturally, the crowd cheers wildly. Meanwhile, Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) of neighboring Sylvania schemes to oust Firefly and take over Freedonia himself. To gather enough evidence to discredit Firefly, he sends his most trusted spies, Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx). Five minutes after they show up in Freedonia, both spies become important members of Firefly's cabinet, though Chicolini keeps his day job as a peanut vendor. Firefly eventually declares war on Sylvania, an absurd farrago with Firefly changing uniforms from scene to scene, Chicolini going to the other side because the food is better, and Pinky parading around the battlefield with a sandwich board reading \"Join the army and see the navy.\"\n\n\"duck soup\",\"duck soup clip\",\"duck soup marx brothers\",\"duck soup part 1\",\"duck soup mirror scene\",\"duck soup trailer\",\"duck soup song\",\"duck soup barbra streisand\",\"duck soup to nuts\",\"groucho marx\",\"margaret dumont\",\"leo mccarey\",\"cigar videos\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"political comedies\",\"herman j mankiewicz\",\"freedom videos\",\"humor videos\",\"oppression videos\",\"parliament videos\",\"rufus t firefly\",\"mrs gloria teasdale\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++14904,/m/01wj9y9,/m/02d10t", "title": "Decode the Scene GAME - Groucho Marx Margaret Dumont Dale Van Sickel MOVIE CLIPS", "publishedDate": "2012-09-27T09:22:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cJxTltdHBI", "description": "Eat like That Guy that reigns at the hand-slap game.

Chaikovski puso m\u00fasica a la adaptaci\u00f3n de Alejandro Dumas (padre) del cuento El cascanueces y el rey de los ratones, de Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (puesta en escena por Marius Petipa y encargado por el director de los Teatros Imperiales Iv\u00e1n Vsevolozhski en 1891). En los pa\u00edses occidentales El cascanueces se ha convertido quiz\u00e1 en el m\u00e1s popular de todos los ballets, principalmente representado en Navidad.\nTchaikovski hizo una selecci\u00f3n de ocho de los n\u00fameros del ballet antes de su estreno en diciembre de 1892, formando La suite de El cascanueces Op. 71a, concebida para tocar en concierto. La suite se toc\u00f3 bajo la direcci\u00f3n del compositor, el 19 de marzo de 1892, con ocasi\u00f3n de una reuni\u00f3n de la sucursal de San Petersburgo de la Sociedad Musical.1 La suite se volvi\u00f3 popular desde entonces, aunque el ballet completo no logr\u00f3 su gran popularidad hasta los a\u00f1os 1960.\nEntre otras cosas, la m\u00fasica de El cascanueces se conoce por su uso de la celesta, un instrumento que el compositor ya hab\u00eda empleado en su balada sinf\u00f3nica mucho menos conocida, El Voivoda (estrenada en 1891). Aunque se conoce como el instrumento solista presentado en el acto II de la Danza del Hada de Az\u00facar, la celesta se emplea en otras partes del mismo acto.\n\nGalardones de este v\u00eddeo (10) \n#25 - Most Discussed (Today)\n#2 - Most Discussed (Today) - M\u00fasica\n#48 - Most Discussed (This Week) - M\u00fasica\n#27 - Most Responded (Today) - M\u00fasica\n#77 - Most Responded (This Week) - M\u00fasica\n#36 - Top Favorited (Today)\n#17 - Top Favorited (Today) - M\u00fasica\n#58 - Top Rated (Today)\n#14 - Top Rated (Today) - M\u00fasica\n#72 - Top Rated (This Week) - M\u00fasica", "title": "El Cascanueces  -  Tchaikovsky", "publishedDate": "2008-12-07T23:18:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cTKUZJUeUo", "description": "You never know who's lurking.\nShare on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1cpgm7M\nLike BuzzFeedVideo on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/1ilcE7k\nShare on Twitter: http://bit.ly/19NDGiT\n\nMusic:\n\n\"Hip Hop\" by Dope (DPB)\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dope-b-dope-beat-n-2/hip-hop\n\nCredits:\n\nWell crafted beach photobomb / reddiholix\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ga9g1/well_crafted_beach_photobomb/\n\nPretty solid photobomb, sir. / M374lllc4\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1a32ox/pretty_solid_photobomb_sir/\n\nUntitled / photobombgirl\nhttp://imgur.com/a/EF0Ve#5\n\nThe Rock photobombs a fan ! / Boshasaurus\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ckkg0/the_rock_photobombs_a_fan_xpost_from_rwwe/\n\nkerinsa marie photography\nhttp://www.kerinsamarie.com\n\nOne is never too old to photobomb a bikini shot / MasterAle\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1l27wf/one_is_never_too_old_to_photobomb_a_bikini_shot/\n\nI raise you my personal best photobomb! / Yalnif\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1nd7t2/i_raise_you_my_personal_best_photobomb/\n\nTim Duncan's accidental photobomb / jaycrew\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1dxdhz/tim_duncans_accidental_photobomb/\n\nPhotobomb Level- Master / RepostFromAYearAgo\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1om7s8/photobomb_level_master/\n\nPhotobomb level: Ninja / MakeMeASteak\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1pmco8/photobomb_level_ninja/\n\nBikini photobomb / MrMagicMoves\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/170069/bikini_photobomb/\n\nthis photobomb Trump's them all\nhttp://imgur.com/wOKVTwP\n\nPhoto bomb before school dance / pepsiguy24\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1h91sz/photo_bomb_before_school_dance/\n\nFilm Footage courtesy of Shutterstock, Inc.,\nUsed by Permission\n\n\nBased On This BuzzFeed Post:\nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/the-most-important-photobombs-of-2013", "title": "Proof No Photo Op Is Safe", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T20:09:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cTZ8dXdt3Y", "description": "Parranda en Villanueva - Guajira", "title": "La Ciquitrilla -- Zamia De La Rossa & Jennifer Arag\u00f3n", "publishedDate": "2014-01-04T18:42:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cTrZkDkKmI", "description": "Projekt domu Aloes.

Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae are the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other, now extinct, families of the order include mammoths and mastodons. The largest living terrestrial animals, male African elephants can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. In addition to their trunks, their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.\n\nElephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions, tigers, hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances.

However, people like me, prefer to save these files on a location other than the default one. I do this, to avoid loss of my PST & OST files in case of formatting, during windows reinstallation, etc.\n\nBut, what if, these files get deleted or lost from the stored location? You will not be able to access Outlook on your system, as the required Outlook files are absent.\n\nNow, to demonstrate the recovery process, I am deleting my PST & OST file using Shift+Delete keys to bypass recycle bin.\n\nTo start the recovery, first you need to visit the site \"recoverdeleteddocument.com\" which shows you about this software that can recover deleted/lost documents. Download it using the button provided here.\n\nAfter installing & launching the software, select \"Recover Files\" module on the main screen.\n\nHere, I will choose \"Recover Lost Files\" module, even though I have to recover deleted files. This is because, this option will allow me to select the file extensions i.e. PST & \nOST, before scanning.\n\nNow, choose the drive from which PST & OST files were deleted & proceed further.\n\nHere, we need to select the file types. I will go to Email section & mark PST & OST files.\n\nNow, software scans the drive for these Outlook files & upon completion, displays a list of recovered files.\n\nThat's it, select OST & PST file from the list & click Next.\n\nHere, provide the location to save the files. Software starts saving the files & output folder containing the recovered files will pop up.\n\nNow, you can use these files on your Outlook profile. Here, you can see how to add this recovered PST file on your Outlook profile.\n\nOk then, hit like if you like this video & visit the link from the description below this video.\nGood Bye.", "title": "Recover Deleted Outlook PST and OST Files", "publishedDate": "2013-09-17T15:15:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cdiHxSlBWs", "description": "Today (3/31/2012) I went out front, and saw our cactus flowering.

This exercise hits all the three; medial, inner and outer heads of triceps.\nLie down on a flat bench and position your feet firmly on the floor. Grasp the barbell (about 4 -- 5 feet long) with an overhand grip (palms facing your feet) with your hands about 8-12 inches apart. Keeping your elbows tucked in at your sides, slowly lower the barbell down to your middle chest until it's about 1 inch from touching. Contract the triceps and push the barbell back up until your arms are almost fully outstretched. Keep your elbows as close to your body as possible during the set. Don't let the bar touch your chest and don't lock your elbows out at the top of the exercise. The breathing and the movement will be the same as doing a regular bench-press. Exhale when while lifting the weight and inhale while lowering. \nIt is important that you do not lockout when doing close grip as you want to keep the tension constant on your triceps. It is strongly advised that you do not put your hands too close together because not only will this put enormous stress on your wrists but also will change the angle to accent more on your elbow than your triceps. \nSame exercise can be done with different angles of the bench and with EZ - bar as well.\nKeep training.\nDr Saranjeet Singh \n(Sports Medicine Specialist)\ndrsaranjeet@gmail.com", "title": "TRICEPS (MEDIAL, INNER & OUTER) - Close Grip Bench Press With Straight Bar", "publishedDate": "2013-02-14T04:33:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cgR1i9wZcE", "description": "By Douce D'Ivry\nGoing Back is Not the Same as Staying\n\nFrom the mixtape:\nhttp://www.goingbackisnotthesameasstaying.com\n\nFB: http://www.facebook.com/fortyfourfores\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/fortyfourfores\nSoundcloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/fore-2", "title": "Fore - Don't Have a Clue (Official Video)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T13:57:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cga_gWH7ZM", "description": "COLEGIO L`HERMITAGE - INICIO DEL A\u00d1O LECTIVO 2012", "title": "INICIO A\u00d1O LECTIVO 2012 L`HERMITAGE", "publishedDate": "2012-03-03T06:49:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cgraMDY1iw", "description": "While boost goes up I get a fluttering noise from up front.

Nowruz is also widely referred to as the Persian New Year. \n\nNowruz is celebrated and observed by Iranian peoples and the related cultural continent and has spread in many other parts of the world, including parts of Central Asia, South Asia, Northwestern China, the Crimea and some groups in the Balkans.\n\nNowruz marks the first day of spring and the beginning of the year in Iranian calendar. It is celebrated on the day of the astronomical vernal equinox, which usually occurs on March 21 or the previous/following day depending on where it is observed. As well as being a Zoroastrian holiday and having significance amongst the Zoroastrian ancestors of modern Iranians, the same time is celebrated in parts of the South Asian sub-continent as the new year. The moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator and equalizes night and day is calculated exactly every year and Iranian families gather together to observe the rituals.\n\nOriginally being a Zoroastrian festival, and the holiest of them all, Nowruz is believed to have been invented by Zoroaster himself, although there is no clear date of origin. Since the Achaemenid era the official year has begun with the New Day when the Sun leaves the zodiac of Pisces and enters the zodiacal sign of Aries, signifying the Spring Equinox.\n\nThe Jewish festival of Purim is probably adopted from the Persian New Year. It is also a holy day for Sufis, Ismailis, Alawites, Alevis, and adherents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. \n\nThe term Nowruz in writing, first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century AD, but it was also an important day during the time of the Achaemenids (c. 648-330 BC), where kings from different nations under the Persian empire used to bring gifts to the Emperor, also called King of Kings (Shahanshah), of Persia on Nowruz. The significance of Nowruz in the Achaemenid empire was such that the great Persian king Cambyses II's appointing as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the New Year festival (Nowruz). \n\nThe UN's General Assembly in 2010 recognized the International Day of Nowruz, describing it a spring festival of Persian origin which has been celebrated for over 3,000 years. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September -- 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, Nowr\u016bz was officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\n\n--\n\nThe Haft S\u012bn items are: * sabzeh - wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish - symbolizing rebirth * samanu - a sweet pudding made from wheat germ - symbolizing affluence * senjed - the dried fruit of the oleaster tree - symbolizing love * s\u012br - garlic - symbolizing medicine * s\u012bb - apples - symbolizing beauty and health * somaq - sumac berries - symbolizing (the color of) sunrise * serkeh - vinegar - symbolizing age and patience.\n\nOther items on the table may include: * Sonbol - Hyacinth (plant) * Sekkeh - Coins - representative of wealth * traditional Iranian pastries such as baghlava, toot, naan-nokhodchi * Aajeel - dried nuts, berries and raisins * lit candles (enlightenment and happiness) * a mirror (symbolizing cleanness and honesty) * decorated eggs, sometimes one for each member of the family (fertility) * a bowl of water with goldfish (life within life, and the sign of Pisces which the sun is leaving). As an essential object of the Nowruz table, this goldfish is also \"very ancient and meaningful\" and with Zoroastrian connection. * rosewater, believed to have magical cleansing powers * the national colours, for a patriotic touch * a holy book (e.g., the Avesta, Qur'an, Bible, Torah, or Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas) and/or a poetry book (almost always either the Shahnameh or the Divan of Hafez)", "title": "P7 Sepahan Esfahan Iran vs. Lekhwia Qatar Football Soccer", "publishedDate": "2012-04-03T19:59:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-cp7ZgcPLvs", "description": "Don't worry reptile lovers, no hooks were used.", "title": "Vlinderagame / Butterfly Lizard  (Leiolepis belliana) in Thailand", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T06:49:12.000Z"}]
