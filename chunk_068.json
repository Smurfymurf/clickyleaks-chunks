In normal speech, people are able to push the vocal source through the rest of the vocal tract.\n\nU.S scientists have now built a program that creates customized voices for the speech-impaired. Patients are first asked to produce whatever sounds they can. Next, the program recruits voice donors of a similar age and build to the patient. The donors then repeat a series of short sentences covering all the sound combinations of their language in a three-hour recording session. \n\nBy using special software, experts are then able to create voices which combine the donor's natural speech and the patient's 'vocal source'. The synthetic voice allows patients to speak any word or sentence - even those not recorded by the donors. \n\nVocaliD, the non-governmental organization set up by Rupal Patel of Northeastern University and Tim Bunnell of Nemours Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children, estimate that about 2.5 million Americans have severe speech impairments. Many patients with conditions such as Parkinson's Disease and cerebral palsy are unable to speak due to damage to the substantia nigra and cerebrum.", "title": "Synthesized, custom voices help rebuild vocal identity of speech-impaired", "publishedDate": "2014-04-30T16:12:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FKX6Rd467w", "description": "", "title": "Squatting on one foot", "publishedDate": "2011-04-13T01:51:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FK_DrJ6SNo", "description": "USA PT Student: Yellow Class 2014", "title": "Dermatome and Myotome Dance Matrix", "publishedDate": "2012-04-18T18:56:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FKao6opjZI", "description": "Howdy Fellows\n                         Here is another update build report for my Trumpeter 1/200 scale USS ARIZONA.

First degree crushing equipment is usually jaw crusher called as primary crusher; secondary crushing equipment is cone crusher, impact crusher and so on; vibrating screen sieves the mixture comes from crushers into several sizes according to the needs. Layers of vibrating screen decide varieties of the final products and screen mesh decides size of the final products. Reshaping equipment is mainly used in the industry which has a higher requirement to the final products, like highway. Reshaping euqipment will eliminate acicular and flakelike products to make the final products evengranular of cubic shapes with higher degree of strength.\n\nOur company can provide many kinds of plans for customer's choice. These plans are optimized combination of equipments' features, customers' demand. These technical indicators should be referred to: \n1. name of the materials; \n2. Materials maximal size;\n3. size of the final products and usage; \n4. capacity.\n\nReasonable plan can be designed according to these technical datas.\n\nSome useful stone production line plans:1. Vibrating feeder + jaw crusher + Multi-cylinder Hydraulic Cone crusher+ reshaping machine (VSI sand making machine) + vibraing screen\nMain charaicteristic of this plan is that it adopts advanced multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher. This makes fine products take a bigger proportion. 80% of the finals can be smaller than the size of discharge opening. It will obviously increase processing capacity and decrease general energy cost. Add reshaping equipment to the secondary crusher can assure the quality and shape of the final products on one hand; on the other, some sands can be chose for other usage.\nThe efficiency of the whole line is very high. Working life of easy-worn parts is long. Continuous operating time of the equipment is longer, and it is easy maintenance. Its general economic profits are higher than the traditional plan.\n\n2. Vibrating feeder + jaw crusher + CS cone crusher + reshaping machine (VSI sand making machine) + vibraing screen\nThis plan adopts high efficiency CS cone crusher and it makes fine products take a bigger proportion. It reduces secondary crushing and gets much more final products. Add reshaping equipment to the secondary crusher can assure the quality and shape of the final products on one hand; on the other, some sands can be chose for other usage.\nWorking life of easy-worn parts of the whole production line is long. It has the feature of easy maintenance, less investment at one time, smaller operating cost and higher general economic profits.\n\n3. Vibrating feeder + jaw crusher + HP singlecylinder cone crusher + vibraing screen\nThis plan is mainly suitable for processing hard material, like granite. Since the secondary crusher is hydraulic equipment, it has the feature of easy maintenance, less investment at one time, simple flow process, easy to operate. It is widely used in the industry which produces mixed materials or there is lower requirement to shape of the materials. This line has the features of combining with few types of equipments, easy maintenance, and indiscrete structure. It is suitable for any scale of investment due to smaller floor space requirement.\n\n4. Vibrating feeder + jaw crusher + CS cone crusher + vibraing screen\nThis plan is suitable for processing hard materials, like granite. Comparing with the same scale plans, the obvious feature of this plan is smaller investment at one time, simple flow process, easy operating and maintenance. The easy-worn parts using is fewer. Its economic profits are higher while maufacturing cost is lower.\n\n5. Vibrating feeder + jaw crusher +Impact crusher + vibraing screen\nThis plan is mainly suitable for processing soft materials, like limestone. Comparing with the same scale plans, the obvious feature of this plan is smaller investment at one time, simple flow process, easy operating and maintenance. This line can produce good final products with nice shape materials. It is widely used as a traditional economic plan.", "title": "Stone Crushing Plant - One complete set of stone production line - kefid Machinery", "publishedDate": "2012-04-25T03:19:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FTS2tdmyYM", "description": "Music video by Good Charlotte performing Girls & Boys.

The third full-length recording from the much loved Anglo-Australian four-piece is made up of smart, beautiful pop music, with lyrics that resonate with experience and melodies that chime, echo and soar.\n\nThe album combines the eagerness, urgency and immediacy of their 2010 self-titled debut with the contemplation, sophistication and ambition of their 2012 follow-up \"Europe,\" and yet it goes beyond either both sonically and in the songs. It was written at a time of considerable change for songwriter Elizabeth Morris, a time during which she fell in love, moved to Italy and got married - not that that seems to have hindered the songwriting process, as Elizabeth explains, \"So many things have happened since I first wrote the songs that make up this album, it's difficult to remember back to where it all began. The songs were written very quickly, during a period when I found writing songs very easy, whereas I often find songwriting very difficult. Some of the songs were written so fast I can't even really remember writing them. The songs were a joy to write, and writing them made me feel better about lots of things.\"\n\nIf the songs came quickly the recording of the album was a more considered process, with the band first testing out the new material at a series of small shows \u2013 christened the Compass Shows \u2013 in North, South, East and West London. They then returned to their spiritual home of Soup Studios, where they recorded their first album, to work with their long-term collaborator, producer Simon Trought. The intention was to capture a more instinctive and fluid live studio sound and to play as well as possible while the red button was on, a different approach to the more piecemeal recording of their previous two albums. Or as Paul Rains put it, \"We've used three years of touring to try and get some of that sweat and grime and togetherness and sweetness and anxiety onto a record.\"\n\nOne of the themes of the new record is new beginnings and things drawing to a close. \"Nothing feels the way it did before and I am grateful for that\", sings Elizabeth on \"Crickets in the Rain\", a song written after her move to Italy and which she describes as \"anti-nostalgia\". Built along the same lines is the gorgeous \"History Lessons\", of which Elizabeth says, \"I guess at some point I became a bit tired of everything seeming better in the past, from music to relationships to buildings to societies. We're a bit obsessed with it and it can become overwhelming. We don't live in the present. This song is trying to express that frustration.\"\n\nAmong the highlights of the album is \"Bright Eyes\", a duet with guitarist Paul Rains. Elizabeth again, \"I wanted to write another duet, but the only problem with doing that is that when you play live it's very rare that the person you recorded it with can be there. So I thought it would be great to write a song with Paul singing the other part. I love Paul's singing and I wanted to hear him do it more, so it's quite selfish really!\" Another standout is the Twin Peaks-referencing \"Half-Heart Necklace\", based on a true story from Elizabeth\u2019s hometown. \"There had been some murders, and this girl who was my age was missing and presumed killed. It turned out she had been hiding for years in her boyfriend's cupboard, and she was charged for wasting police time\".\n\nOther notable tracks include the rollicking \"Kings and Queens\", inspired by a show they played in the USA with their friends and kindred spirits The Wave Pictures, and \"Romance and Adventure\", originally earmarked for a film soundtrack and written in response to a challenge from Paul to write a pop song in a minor key. Bass player Bill Botting sums up Elizabeth\u2019s remarkable songwriting ability by saying, \"The key to Elizabeth\u2019s songwriting appeal is that she\u2019s so adept at pinpointing certain ideas and moods; leaving one city and finding a new one and realising that beginnings and endings have a lot in common.\"\n\nThe truism is that third albums are difficult beasts, but by remaining true to themselves Allo Darlin\u2019 have side-stepped the pitfalls to produce a wonderful record - thoughtful and exciting and exquisitely played \u2013 that will please their existing army of fans and newcomers alike. On first reading the album\u2019s title may seem enigmatic, but from the very personal nature of Elizabeth Morris\u2019 finely drawn vignettes to the more universal connections between the band and their audience, its meaning will be obvious to all who fall under the spell of this magical band.", "title": "Allo Darlin' - Bright Eyes", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T16:33:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FZCexFiG7M", "description": "", "title": "Mudpuppy", "publishedDate": "2013-04-30T17:49:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FZOZgvwJ2g", "description": "Army Men 2", "title": "Army Men 2 explos\u00e3o", "publishedDate": "2012-01-20T13:53:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FZU4qBP2EU", "description": "", "title": "What Structures Connect The Cerebral Hemispheres?", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T02:30:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3FZgDwPKZjY", "description": "Forgot to widescreen it.

This is a phenomenon whereby, given a uniformly moving mass of particles, the smaller particles sink downwards and the larger ones float to the surface. The inflated airbag increases the victim's volume and greatly amplifies this inverse segregation effect. The avalanche backpack helps prevent total burial in the snow. It also keeps the victim's head on the surface, and its bright colour aids rapid localisation.\n\nWirkungsweise des Systems:\nBeim Lawinenabgang wird durch Ziehen des Ausl\u00f6segriffs die Luft aus der Hochdruck-Kartusche freigesetzt und der Lawinenairbag 150 L innerhalb von 3 Sek. aufgeblasen.\n\nDie Wirkungsweise des Lawinenairbags beruht auf dem physikalischen Prinzip der \"inversen Segregation\".

They furnished it, their architect came in.\"\n\nInner City Press asked, who decided that the press would not have the same access it had before?\n\nAdlerstein paused; there was laughter. Inner City Press said, \"It's a press conference\" -- albeit about the re-opening of the Trusteeship Council Chamber.\n\nAdlerstein then told Inner City Press, \"this was a discussion which is still ongoing. As the building opens, I think that dialogue with the press will evolve.\"\n\nWhile Inner City Press didn't say it, the UN's dialogue on press access, accreditation and other matters can no longer by limited to the old UN Correspondents' Association.\n\nUNCA has been ineffectual; worse, it has tried to get the UN to throw out media that the wire services that dominate the UNCA Executive Committee don't like. It has become, at least at the level of the Executive Committee, the UN's Censorship Alliance.\n\n  And so, here, the new Free UN Coalition for Access, which has been advocating on this and wider needed reforms.\n\nInner City Press asked Adlerstein if Turkey would have a say in whether the space would be accessible to the press, as it was before the renovation and Turkish \"gifting.\"\n\nAdlerstein said, \"it's not their area... it will be managed by who uses it.\"\n\nBut wouldn't that be the press? Watch this site.\n\nFootnotes: Adlerstein offered a detailed explanation of the re-designs of the Trusteeship Council Chamber, from a horseshoe facing front to a lower one facing outward, only two steps high to allow a ramp for accessibility.\n\nInner City Press asked why the coffee loft in the Delegates' Lounge was taken out. Adlerstein explained that its single staircase did not comply with fire code -- which the UN \"voluntarily\" allows \"visits\" to assess -- and the cost of installing an elevator would be prohibitive.

Not to say that the praise isn\u2019t well earned, though.\n\nBut in a bizarre twist, Monday night, in central Japan, the retired former fire chief of the city of Utsunomiya, set his own home ablaze! The former fire chief was 70 years old, living at home with his son and running a karaoke joint on the side.\n\nHe has since been arrested but no reason has been given as to why he would burn down his own house.\n\nHe had thoroughly doused the interior of the home with gasoline and stayed inside to ensure that the fire was in full blaze before evacuating the house. No one was killed in the fire, but the house was completely gutted.\n\nThe former fire chief escaped with just minor injuries to his forehead and left ankle from flash burns, but it really is a puzzler as to why this old retiree would choose to burn his house down when he spent his entire career putting out fires.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The use of millimetre-wave techniques at 60 GHz offers many advantages for short-range systems compared to radio methods at lower frequencies. The main advantages of this frequency band are, on the one hand, the large (license-free) bandwidth which permits high data rates and in the short wavelength on the other which leads to small antenna dimensions even with multi-antenna systems. Furthermore, there is no interference with existing radio systems. In view of the high radio field attenuation and the high transmission losses of walls, the radio cells are small, but interferences by other millimetre-wave systems and neighbouring radio cells are small as well. One immediate application is, for example, wireless multimedia supply in aircraft cabins. In this respect, the properties of the broadband 60 GHz indoor channels are examined, system concept are developed and evaluated on real-time experimental system.", "title": "Millimeter Wave Technology for 5G", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T13:53:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GDXXsqQL8A", "description": "Another (shittah) video.

All caught on tape. This will for sure leave you awe struck! Not for the faint hearted.\n\nCeliotomy, else known as Open abdominal surgery or laparotomy refers to any surgical operation in which the abdomen is opened to access or inspect the organs of the abdominal cavity.\n\nTraditionally, surgeons perform the majority of gynecologic surgery using an \"open\" approach, which is through a wide (6-12 inch) abdominal incision below the navel and through the abdominal muscle wall.\n\nThe skin incision can be either transverse (horizontal) or vertical. The transverse incision is usually an inch or so above the pubic bone. This type of incision is also known as a \"bikini\" incision. This is the most common type of incision used during C-section.\n\nOpen abdominal surgery can be painful, involving heavy pain medications, risk of infection, significant blood loss and increased risk for transfusion. After surgery, a long recovery (often 6 weeks) is usually necessary. In addition, many patients are not happy with the scar left by the incision.\n\nWhile minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) has been available for two decades now for many routine gynecologic procedures, most complex hysterectomy, myomectomies and sacrocolpopexies are performed using open surgery. This is because conventional laparoscopic technology can't provide surgeons the visualization, precision, dexterity and control required to handle challenges like large uteri, multiple adhesions from prior pelvic surgery. \n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

What gets less notice are the early warning signs. \n\n\"If they're not going to their doctor, if they're not seeing their physician they're not having those lab works, they're not reporting their signs they could just be going along with their normal daily activities,\" says Melanie Aracri, a certified diabetes educator for Lee Memorial Health System. \n\nAll too often patients show up at a hospital in a health crisis and find out they have highly elevated blood sugar. New studies find 1 in 10 heart attack patients may have undetected diabetes. We've broken down 5 warnings signs that should get your attention.\n\n\"The three classic signs of high blood sugar, we call them the three \"P\"s:  polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Those are increased thirst, increased hunger, and increased urination,\" says Aracri. \n\nIt's easy to minimize increased thirst, especially when it's hot. And frequent urination seems to naturally follow. But experts say it could be our body's way of flushing extra glucose.\n\n\"The kidney has to work really hard to get that blood sugar out, that blood glucose out when it's high,\" says Aracri. \n\nWounds that don't heal could be another warning sign.\n\n\"The body's not able to fight that infection because of that extra glucose in the system,\" says Aracri. \n\nFrequent yeast or urinary tract infections may also be a red flag many people fail to consider. The earlier diabetes is picked up, the easier it is to avoid complications.\n\n\"it's a learning how to adapt your eating pattern, your meal plan to your lifelong activities and daily habits,\" says Aracri.  \n\nView More Health Matters video segments at leememorial.org/healthmatters/\n\nLee Memorial Health System in Fort Myers, FL is the largest network of medical care facilities in Southwest Florida and is highly respected for its expertise, innovation and quality of care.

Today, we're going to work on the trick of having a dog get their\nleash. Betty here already knows how to get her leash, but I want to show\nyou how to get your dog interested in something and targeting something\nthat they had no prior interaction with. She's never really worked with a\nFrisbee before, so hopefully, you can see the beginning stages of this.\n\nI'm going to try putting this on the ground and letting her investigate it.\nWhen she touches her nose to it, I'm going to click this clicker and then\ngive her a treat. As she comes over to it, I click and give her a treat.\nShe might have even just looked at it or wandered over, placed her paw on\nit. Anything like that in the beginning of teaching a behavior like this is\nfine, and you should click and reward them. She knows the game of targeting\nsomething. Some dogs who have never done this before might take a while to\nbecome interested and understand the game. Now she's clearly interested.\n\nThe next thing I would look for is for her to put it in her mouth. That can\ntake a little time, but in general, dogs are all about the mouth and\nthey'll start exploring, and eventually, put their mouth on it. You want to\nbe down really low, especially with small dogs, so you can see when they\nopen their mouth and put their teeth on it. As soon as that happens, I\nwould click and give them a treat. When they're getting good at that, you\ncan take the object you're working with, and when they pick up, you click\nand treat. As they get better at it, you might want to start waiting until\nthey bring it over a little bit. You can encourage them to bring it over or\njust wait and see if it happens naturally, that they walks towards you with\nit in their mouth.\n\nThis is one of the things you'll fight; she thinks its super-fun to swing\nthis around. To avoid that, you can try tying the leash up, you can try\ndoing a shorter leash. Her cue for getting this is just the world 'leash'.\nKeep your cues really short. Instead of 'get the leash', I prefer just\n'leash'; it's much easier for a dog to understand. As she gets better and\nbetter, hopefully she'll bring it all the way to me, drop it, and place it\nin my hand, eventually.", "title": "How to Teach Your Dog to Get the Leash | Dog Tricks", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25T10:24:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GOcwP29vQo", "description": "SIEHE AUCH DAZU http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-dT-CVuG1c&NR=1  Die Rhododendron -- eine immergr\u00fcner Pflanze.

The monocled cobra was described as \"very dangerous and venomous\" and, although it is not typically aggressive, it injects a neurotoxin venom that can kill within hours.\n\n\"Do not approach it, do not try to capture it, do not try to kill it,\" said Brandon Dowling, a Los Angeles County spokesman, adding that if the snake does bite someone, antivenom will be flown in from the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe cobra was spotted and photographed Wednesday and appeared to be several feet long. It bit a dog on Monday evening, but the owner didn't report it until Tuesday, Dowling said. The dog, named Kiko, was seen on television reports sporting a large red wound on its neck but otherwise appeared healthy.\n\nFull story: http://karmastop.com/albino-cobra-snake-in-thousand-oaks-california-scares-the-neighborhood/", "title": "Albino cobra snake scares upscale neighborhood in California", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T15:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3G_E78_5Igw", "description": "CaseLiner special ROTARY SUBSIDIARY BOOM supporting air hose.

A neighbor living across the street filed suit in December, saying that the synagogue's activities were disruptive and violated the deed restrictions for the property owners' association. Those restrictions limit homes to residential use.\n\nDistrict Judge Jill Willis said she was denying the temporary injunction based on the law and the brief evidence heard Thursday. The lawsuit, which was filed in Collin County, will proceed.\n\n\"I'm overfilled with appreciation to the judge,\" Rabbi Yaakov Rich said after the hearing. He was concerned the congregation wouldn't have a place to meet for Passover, which begins Monday.\n\n\"We try to be in every way possible good neighbors and [as] responsive to the neighborhood's concerns as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe suit is filed against Judith Gothelf and her son, Mark Gothelf, who purchased the home last year and allow the congregation to use it. The congregation is also named in the suit.\n\nRich's 22-year-old son lives at the home. In addition, the congregation, which totals 30-plus families, meets twice a day there for worship as well as for other activities.\n\n\"There are over 40 persons coming and going daily, from dawn until dusk,\" said David Schneider, who filed the suit. \"This is far in excess of any reasonable expectation my family has for the quiet enjoyment of our neighborhood. Our neighbors are just as frustrated.\"\n\nHis petition cited the loss of value for his home because of the congregation's operations. He is seeking $50,000 in damages as well as a permanent injunction to ban the congregation from operating out of any home in the neighborhood.\n\nThe property owners' association filed as an intervenor in the case. Attorney David A. Surratt, who represents the nonprofit group, said the HOA had been evaluating the situation when Schneider filed suit, so they decided to join.\n\n\"There's no opposition to people having prayer meetings or things like that, as any homeowner would,\" he said. \"The issue is the level of activity for the property that was purchased primarily for the purpose of operation as a synagogue.\"\n\nJustin Butterfield is senior counsel at the Liberty Institute, a nonprofit legal group that advocates for religious liberty. He said granting the injunction would have put a substantial burden on the congregation's religious practices. \"We're happy ... we were able to protect the religious liberty rights for the families in this congregation,\" said Butterfield, who is helping to defend the case.\n\n\"The evidence showed that the congregation really does fit into the community, and it is a good benefit to the surrounding area,\" he said.\n\nBut Schneider said in a statement that the case is far from over. \"I fully expect the final decision to be consistent with long-established Texas law, which is [that] churches and synagogues must honor contractual agreements just as the rest of us must,\" he said.", "title": "Court Allows Dallas Synagogue To Operate In Home", "publishedDate": "2014-04-13T23:32:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Gh-1NX0Zao", "description": "Winner : Lord of the Dance", "title": "Meeting 11 - Race 2 : The Afrasia Private Banking Cup", "publishedDate": "2012-06-03T16:21:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GhU-T0OZAc", "description": "Custom built 565cid Dart Motor\nTwin Turbo, Fuel injected, 1200hp", "title": "S & S 1969 Twin Turbo Corvette 6", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T19:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GiJiMhuY4k", "description": "Nathan Fielder has valuable real estate lessons to share.", "title": "Nathan Fielder (On Your Side) -  Real Estate", "publishedDate": "2008-07-23T01:56:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Giqw9yUoAw", "description": "THE PRIEST PERFORMNG LIVE.", "title": "JUDAS PRIEST  [ DIAMONDS & RUST ] LIVE 1982", "publishedDate": "2013-07-22T22:08:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GjE35otRA0", "description": "elle me rend dingue cette zik", "title": "Humphrey - Dingue", "publishedDate": "2012-05-16T14:41:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "3GjqiUa0oY8", "description": "One man seeks to steal the salt from a compound in Rural Kentucky.

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each.

It was granted by King Philip II to Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Osorio, Viceroy of Sicily and Catalonia, and later Marquis of Villafranca del Bierzo in inheritance from his elder brother.\u00a0 It was conferred on him the 24 December 1559, along with the Princedom of Montalb\u00e1n.\n\u00a0\nThe title was usually held by the heirs apparent of the Marquises of Villafranca, and merged into the House of Medina Sidonia in 1779 when Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 11th Marquis of Villafranca and 8th Duke of Fernandina inherited the Dukedom of Medina Sidonia from a distant cousin. After the death 12th Duke, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, none of his sons claimed the title, so the Dukedom of Fernandina became dormant. 80 years later, the 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia and her son the Count of Niebla ceded their rights to the title to their daughter and sister, Pilar Gonz\u00e1lez de Gregorio, who asked for the resumption of the dormant dukedom. On 1 February 1993, the title was restored with Grandeeship of Spain by King Juan Carlos I to Pilar, who became the 13th Duchess of Fernandina and is the current holder of the title.\n\nYouTube:  www.YouTube.com/SEASitalia  \n\n(C) SEASitalia@att.net 2011.

Sometimes, it develops into riots, tribulations, vandalism and bloodshed. Those who hold an opinion different from these disruptive, riotous and rowdy Ulama, are also declared denigrators and Kafirs. As a result, the pragmatic and rational Ulalma expediently keep reticent in self-regard. Performing his duty, as ever, of leading the Ummah to the right path, Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri has dilated upon this complex scholarly subject of research:\n\nWho is a denigrator of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him)?\n\nWhat words precisely prove denigration?\n\nHow the protection of the Messenger's holiness and the inviolability of the Prophet's Din are co-related?

For one or more specific sequences in a DNA sample, quantitative PCR enables both detection and quantification. The quantity can be either an absolute number of copies or a relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes.\n\nThe procedure follows the general principle of polymerase chain reaction; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses in \"real time\". This is a new approach compared to standard PCR, where the product of the reaction is detected at its end. Two common methods for the detection of products in quantitative PCR are: (1) non-specific fluorescent dyes that intercalate with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific DNA probes consisting of oligonucleotides that are labelled with a fluorescent reporter which permits detection only after hybridization of the probe with its complementary sequence to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA in cells or tissues.\n\nqPCR is the abbreviation used for quantitative PCR (real-time PCR).[1] Real-time reverse-transcription PCR is often denoted as: qRT-PCR[2][3][4] The acronym \"RT-PCR\" commonly denotes reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.

They were arrested by the police in November 2012 for inciting and participating in the illegal strike and had earlier claimed trial with trial dates set for the March.\n\nHowever on Friday 22, the four men's lawyers said their clients' decision to plead came after prosecution gave an indication of the various sentencing options.\n\nOn November 26 last year, 171 SMRT bus drivers failed to report for duty in a protest over pay and living conditions.\n\nEighty-eight of them stayed away from work the next day.\n\nIn December 2012, a SMRT bus driver, Bao Feng Shan, 38, also from China, was sentenced to six weeks' jail for taking part in the same illegal strike.\n\nIn giving his oral grounds for decision, Senior District Judge See Kee Oon said public transport is an essential service and that although the four men's conduct was motivated by their grievances, their plea of guilt indicated that they knew they ought not to have taken the law into their own hands.\n\nThe judge said the aggravating factor was that they put pressure on SMRT to give in to their demands.\n\nHe said the move had the potential to affect the daily lives of all who relied on public transport.\n\nApart from online chat, the four men also made personal visits to fellow Chinese bus drivers.\n\nWhile the judge noted that the defence lawyers argued that the key here was the failure to submit the notice before going on strike, he said \"ignorance of the law cannot excuse them entirely\".\n\nHe added that while the situation may well have been better handled by their former employer SMRT, the court is not the platform to address this, much less the perceived shortcomings on the employer's part.\n\nwww.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1256346/1/.html", "title": "4 ex-SMRT bus drivers involved in illegal strike sentenced to jail - 25Feb2013", "publishedDate": "2013-02-25T15:04:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HMj8sKmurc", "description": "En Viveiro las avispas no tienen miedo a los aspabientos que hace la gente para hacer que se larguen porque ya est\u00e1n acostumbradas a los molinillos, mientras que los muiles ya han aprendido a bailar circle pit en la r\u00eda... \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1Son los efectos del Resurrection Fest en la fauna local!!!", "title": "Muil\u00b4s circle pit", "publishedDate": "2009-08-22T15:33:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HMluoNimhk", "description": "\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e22 Cover \u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e30 \n\nLBK", "title": "Bullet - Hollywood Undead By \u0e1e\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e22 lawbreaker", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T13:45:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HN5dasaeJ4", "description": "\u2013Forgoing Medicaid expansion is disproportionately hurting minorities\n\nhttp://kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/the-impact-of-the-coverage-gap-in-states-not-expanding-medicaid-by-race-and-ethnicity/\n\n\u2013On the Bonus Show: Quarantine in China over the Bubonic plague, searching for aliens by searching for smog, scientists \u201cdelete\u201d HIV from the body, more\u2026\n\nWebsite: http://www.davidpakman.com\nBecome a Member: http://www.davidpakman.com/membership\nBe our Patron on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/davidpakman\nDiscuss This on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/davidpakmanshow\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/davidpakmanshow\nTDPS Gear: http://www.davidpakman.com/gear\n24/7 Voicemail Line: (219)-2DAVIDP\n\nSubscribe to The David Pakman Show for more: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=midweekpolitics\n\nSupport TDPS by clicking (bookmark it too!) this link before shopping on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/?tag=thedavpaksho-20\n\nBroadcast on July 29, 2014", "title": "Forgoing Medicaid Expansion Disproportionately Hurts Minorities", "publishedDate": "2014-08-29T22:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HN8L0W8ewY", "description": "Sean Avery's suspension-inducing Sloppy Seconds comment and reactions from teammates", "title": "Sean Avery - Class Act!", "publishedDate": "2008-12-02T23:30:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HNL-pL3Opk", "description": "BLUE SUMMER RASCAL \u00e9talon paint horse homozygote pour le g\u00e8ne tobiano, disponible pour saillies \u00e0 l'\u00e9levage MP2 paint horse au Domaine de l'Argens (Puget sur Argens - Var)", "title": "SAILLIE ETALON PAINT HORSE", "publishedDate": "2014-05-04T22:13:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HNObWzDa4M", "description": "\u30e6\u30ce\u3068\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30df\u30f3", "title": "NEXT Rat Tat Tat", "publishedDate": "2013-08-31T11:27:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HO0wl4Utv0", "description": "Wheat dosa mixed with coriander leaves,onion,curry leaves,coconut,green chilly  etc...A preferred breakfast for diet conscious people.

WHEN Sharon Fritts married her husband Donnie she promised to stick by him through thick and thin. But within a few years those vows were to be tested as Donnie developed an aggressive form of cancer on his face. In early 2003 Donnie was told by doctors to make a choice: his face or his life. He decided to have an operation that would remove the ultra-rare cancer\u2014called ameloblastic carcinoma -- along with much of his face. The 12-hour surgery was a success but left Donnie, a former carpenter, with a gaping hole in the middle of his face. He no longer had a nose, upper lip and palate and part of his forehead was missing. There was some joy in 2011 as a top team of surgeons gave Donnie a prosthetic to make it look like he had a normal face. But sadly their joy was short-lived as Donnie developed a life-threatening infection. He battled back to health but was forced to wait for a new prosthetic. Sharon is determined to stand by the man she loves until a solution can be found. She said: \"Donnie is an amazing man. He's so funny and has kept his sense of humor throughout. I still see the man I saw when we walked down the aisle.\" Donnie and Sharon's story will feature in an episode of new series Body Bizarre, titled Born With An Extra Body: Body Bizarre at 10pm on Monday November 25th.\n\nhttp://www.uk.tlc.com/shows/body-bizarre/\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the \nLike Barcroft TV on Facebook: http://goo.gl/7ayYgY\nFollow Barcroft TV on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9\nBarcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp", "title": "The Man With A Hole In His Face: Body Bizarre Episode 3", "publishedDate": "2013-11-21T13:35:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HhAomZujhA", "description": "Self Inflicted Wounds recorded live at the Agincourt in Camberly. 9/10/2010.", "title": "Memories In Torment - Self Inflicted Wounds", "publishedDate": "2010-10-11T08:48:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HhP2ZoceGA", "description": "", "title": "Araucaria Itagui 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-03-02T01:34:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Hi8NpsBSts", "description": "Obvious Brainwash And Hidden Symbolism.\n\nFor newbies: If you want to know who the \"Illuminati\" are, please google keywords like \"New World Order + Illuminati\" / \"One World Government + Illuminati\".

Get beautiful penmanship today with Master Handwriting.\nhttp://your-health.co/improve-your-handwriting-master.php\n\nMaster Handwriting course is also an excellent guide to help your child get better handwriting.\nAccording to Prof. Carey Jewitt from the London University's Institute of Education, children's handwriting is currently at an all time low, mainly because they are failing to get appropriate practice at home and in the classroom.\n\nProper handwriting will require sufficient small muscle development, good eye-hand coordination, the ability to hold writing tools properly, a capacity to form smooth strokes such as lines, the ability to recognize forms and letters, and a good orientation to printed language. Children should be able to scribble on paper at about 12 months, draw vertical lines and circles by the age of 3, write their own name by 4 to 5 years, and copy most upper and lower case letters by the age of 5 or 6.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide to improving your child's handwriting, visit Master Handwriting - Improve your child's handwriting in minutes!\nhttp://your-health.co/improve-your-handwriting-master.php\n\nRelated: penmanship,  handwriting practice,  how to improve handwriting,  handwriting for kids,  how to improve writing skills,  how to improve your handwriting,  cursive handwriting practice,  handwriting expert,  handwriting without tears worksheets,  nice handwriting,  improving handwriting,  penmanship worksheets,  handwriting practice for kids,  practice handwriting,  learn how to write,  best handwriting,  penmanship practice,  d nealian handwriting practice,  improve your handwriting,  teaching handwriting,  how to have better handwriting,  how to have good handwriting,  learning to write worksheets,  handwriting templates,  better handwriting,  handwriting practice for adults,  how to get good handwriting,  improve penmanship,  learn handwriting", "title": "How To Improve Handwriting in Minutes!

According to an article by Fareed Zakaria, the reason this has happened is entirely due to our costly, and utterly ineffective, \"War on Drugs.\" Zakaria discusses the U.S. prison population as being seven to ten times higher than that of other industrialized nations because of it.\n\nAlso among the statistics he lists are the 1.66 million people arrested in 2009 because of drugs, and that four out of five of those arrests were simply for possession. Not robbery or burglary, not DUI, not drug-related violence, possession. Sentences vary widely based on the type of drug found, and how much is there, among other things. Approximately 80% of people serving a sentence for possession are first-time offenders, and the average federal sentence is just under seven years, while the average sentence for a state offense is 20 months.\n\nRead More At:\nhttp://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/05/10/u-s-war-on-drugs-all-cost-no-benefit-brings-more-people-to-prison-than-were-in-the-gulag-archipelago/\n\nClip from the Friday, May 10th 2013 edition of The Kyle Kulinski Show, which airs live on Blog Talk Radio and Secular Talk Radio monday - friday 5-7pm Eastern.\n\nCheck out our website - and become a member - at:\nhttp://www.SecularTalkRadio.com\n\nListen to the Live Show or On Demand archive at:\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/kylekulinski\n\nFollow on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/kylekulinski\n\nLike on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SecularTalk", "title": "US Prison Population Higher Than Stalin's Gulags", "publishedDate": "2013-05-11T18:12:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "3HuGt_li2No", "description": "Ellen invented a new way to help you stay fit while you take phone calls.

We have included as an option to purchase our custom designed storage/saddle bag for those who do not have one already. Dress your horse and do it in style, all the while being safely visible while riding.\n\nEvery day riders have to navigate along busy roads to make it to a trail.  More often than not, and depending on the time of year, riders find themselves returning at dusk and back to the barn in the dark. Despite ineffective reflectors, and without adequate lighting, horses are often not seen by motorists until it is too late.  Tail Lights will change the way we see horses, and their riders, at any time of the day...or night.\n\nOther uses for Tail Lights\n\nEndurance Riders - With a battery life of over 15 hours, and as long as 26 hours, (depending on the setting) you will feel confident that Tail Lights will have you covered no matter where you are in the race.\nRodeo and Performance Groups - Get your bling on! Be remembered and be flashy as you streak by with your custom colors and lighting patterns.\nCarriage Drivers - Be beautiful as well as safe. Attach them to the back of your carriage for a brilliant, unavoidable, effect.  \nMounted Police - With police only patterns utilizing blue and red, Tail Lights will make you stand out in a crowd.  We have designed our product to let you signal when you are standing by (slow shifting from blue to red) or engaged (Blue/Red strobing pattern with the same timing of a police vehicle). This is for POLICE only, and all requests for this color scheme MUST come with a departmental letter head and authorization from the Police Department to be shipped.\nMini's to Drafts - If it has a tail, Tail Lights will work.  We have even designed shorter sets for our smaller friends, so they will be just as bright!\nWe Have Come Along Way...\n\nFor the last 4 years, we have made many prototypes and different components were tested with various levels of success and failure.  Most of the materials out there are either not bright enough, or the battery life simply could not keep up with our demands.\n\nWe now have the best design using the right materials.\n\n4 years ago, after a long day of trail riding, Sami and her friend were riding both of Sami's horses back to the barn.  Despite living in an equestrian community, wearing reflectors and other safety gear, Sami's horse that her friend was riding, was hit by a car.  \n\nFrom that moment on, Sami has worked to create the worlds first equestrian illumination system.  \n\nSami has taken all of her experience from 38 years of working both personally and professionally in the equestrian community and created a beautiful, colorful, and durable answer to reflectors alone.  Her years as a Mounted Search and Rescuer in rural Montana, has helped her incorporate not only beauty and fun into the unit, but safety as well.  With 3 different levels of lighting for comfort of the horses, as well as during emergency situations, Tail Lights has it all.\n\nVideo used with permission.

Filmed In 1080 HD\n\nThe river and its tributaries flow through largely rural areas, Tonbridge, Maidstone and Medway being the exceptions. The Medway itself initially flows in a west-east direction south of the North Downs; at the confluence of the River Beult, however, it turns northerly and breaks through the North Downs at the Medway Gap, a steep and narrow valley near Rochester, before its final section to the sea.\n \n\n\n\n\nAllington Lock and Sluice, it is at this point that the river becomes tidal. \nUntil 1746 the river was impassable above Maidstone. To that point each village on the river had its wharf or wharves: at Halling, Snodland, New Hythe and Aylesford. Cargoes included corn, fodder, fruit, stone and timber.\n \nIn 1746 improvements to the channel meant that barges of 40 long tons (41 t) could reach East Farleigh, Yalding and even Tonbridge. In 1828 the channel was further improved to Leigh in 1828. There are eleven locks on the river. The lowest, opened in 1792, is at Allington, and is the extent of tides. The others are East Farleigh, Teston, Hampstead Lane, Stoneham Old Lock (disused), Sluice Weir Lock, Oak Wier Lock, East Lock, Porter's, Eldridge's and Town Lock in Tonbridge. The locks will take craft up to 80 feet (24 m) by 18 feet (5.5 m), and vessels with a draft of 4 feet (1.2 m) can navigate the river. The shallowest point is just below Sluice Weir Lock which is prone to silting after heavy rain.[5]\n \nSmall craft such as canoes can sometimes travel as far as Penshurst. The stretch from Leigh to Allington is known as the Medway Navigation, and is 19 miles (31 km) in length.\nUpper Upnor comprises a village cobbled high street leading down to Upnor Castle. It has many houses displaying Kentish weatherboarding, some are Grade II listed. [3][4] It also has some terraced streets formerly used by the MOD and also Castle Street. It is on Chatham Reach directly opposite St Mary's Creek\n\nTug Boat Nipashore.", "title": "Upnor The River Medway.

They protect the furniture and help to extend the life of your furniture. Besides, slipcovers make it easy to update your home decor. All you have to do for an instant makeover is choose new slipcovers for your furniture like the sofa and armchairs. The first step of putting on a slipcover over the sofa is to drape it on the back and then securing the Velcro, working your way from the front to the back. It helps to start from a lower point such as the arms to a higher point like the backrest. To ensure a snug fit, pull the slipcover firmly over the arms and the backrest. Slipcovers for roll-arm sofas have Velcro for a better fit. The Velcro helps to define the shape of the sofa. Sofas from Pottery Barn come with industrial-strength Velcro that holds securely. If the slipcover won't lay flat, start again from the front of the arm. Fit the slipcover over the arms and then work to the backrest. Align the seam and corner of the slipcover with the top of the sofa. Tuck any extra fabric into sides of the cushion. Be sure to tuck in extra fabric around the arms for a secure fit. Finally, fit the cushions into their individual slipcovers. The last step is to accessorize the sofa with decorative pillows and throws.\n\n To know more, visit: http://www.potterybarn.com/\n\nTake a look at some slipcovers from Pottery Barn:\nhttp://www.potterybarn.com/products/pb-comfort-dining-chair-slipcovers/\n\nCheck out this loose-fit slipcover:\nhttp://www.potterybarn.com/products/twill-dropcloth-loose-fit-slipcover/\n\nDecorate your home with this slipcovered sofa:\nhttp://www.potterybarn.com/products/pb-comfort-roll-slipcovered-box-edge-sofa-collection-performance/\n\nPair your sofa with this slipcovered armchair:\nhttp://www.potterybarn.com/products/pb-comfort-grand-armchair/\n\nLearn how to choose fabrics for your home:\nhttp://www.potterybarn.com/design-studio/articles/lr-performance-fabrics.html", "title": "How To: Put On A Sofa Slipcover | Pottery Barn", "publishedDate": "2013-11-26T00:49:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IGRqgjhqtk", "description": "The fast moving Littoral Combat Ship can rapidly swap out mission packages and transit twice as fast as the ships it is replacing.

Phrynocephalus\nAlso called the Toadhead Agama, these small desert-dwelling lizards exhibit several odd behaviors. They communicate to one another by curling and uncurling their tails, vibrate their bodies to bury themselves quickly in sand and will frighten away predators with a set of bizarre-looking, colorful mouth flaps, seen here.\n9. Brookesia minima\nChameleons are highly unique reptiles to begin with -- their toes are fused into lobster-like pincers, their tails are prehensile, they express their moods by changing color, their binocular-like eyeballs move independently of one another and their long tongues famously launch at insect prey like a gooey harpoon gun. Unusual even for a chameleon, however, is Brookesia minima, the dwarf leaf chameleon, certainly one of the tiniest reptiles known to man.\n8. Phrynosoma\nThe \"horned toad\" lizards are names for their blunt, fat bodies and thick covering of protective horns and spines. Inhabiting dry, sandy environments, they feed almost exclusively on ants and boast one of nature's most gruesome defense mechanisms; when frightened, a few species can build blood pressure in their head until tiny vessels around their eyes are ruptured, squirting streams of blood at the attacker. The foul taste of this blood, likely extracted from the acid in ants, lets mammalian predators know not to waste their time. Unfortunately, birds don't seem to mind the taste at all.\n7. Moloch horridus\nThough entirely unrelated to the horned toads, the \"thorny devil\" lizard or \"moloch\" has evolved many of the same characteristics in response to its desert environment, including a thorny body, sandy camouflage and a diet of ants. While their thorns make them rather difficult to swallow, predators may not figure this out without taking a few test bites, so a horned knob behind the moloch's head acts as a less vital \"decoy\" head.\n6. Hydrosaurus pustulatus\nLooking like it crawled straight out of the Permian age, the Philippine sailfin lizard is an amphibious omnivore feeding on fruits, nuts insects and other small prey near tropical rivers. Their flattened toes allow small specimens to flee predators by literally running on water, a trait also shared by the \"basilisk\" or \"jesus\" lizard. Adult males are known to take on beautiful blue, red or even purple color patterns, which you can see here:\n5. Amblyrhynchus cristatus\nThe marine iguanas of the Galapagos islands boast a lifestyle shared by no other reptile; like penguins or sea lions, they spend their entire lives on the shoreline, diving into the water for their food. They live exclusively on a diet of green algae, using their blunt jaws to scrape it from submerged rocks. Charles Darwin was famously repulsed by these animals when he first discovered them, and referred to them in his notes as \"imps of darkness.\"\n4. Flying gecko\nMany gecko lizards have the amazing ability to scale any surface -- even smooth glass -- thanks to microscopic branches in the skin of their toes, clinging velcro-like to materials on a molecular level. About the only thing more amazing would be if they could fly...and several species come pretty close. Flying geckos use their webbed feet, broad tails and flaps of skin to glide from tree to tree, much like the flying squirrel.\n3. Heloderma suspectum\nAlong with the closely related \"beaded lizard,\" The Gila Monster was once recognized as one of the world's only lizards with a venomous bite, delivering a painful neurotoxin through grooves in its tiny, sharp teeth. We now know that many other lizards possess at least trace amounts of a mild venom, but the Gila Monster is still likely one of the most toxic -- and its common name is just plain cool.\n2. Bipes biporus\nThe Mexican Mole Lizard or Baja Worm Lizard is technically neither lizard nor snake, but an Amphisbaenian. These strange, burrowing reptiles commonly lack limbs or even eyes, spending their entire lives underground where they hunt worms and insects. B. biporus is unusual among the group for having a very prominent pair of clawed, mole-like front legs...though it still has no hind limbs at all.\n1. Varanus komodoensis\n(they sure are cute when they're asleep, aren't they?)\nThe Komodo dragon is the largest carnivorous lizard alive today, sometimes reaching nearly ten feet in length. Though a great deal of their diet includes rotting carrion, they will also stalk live prey as large as deer to deliver a single, stealthy bite, after which they need only wait as the victim wears down from blood loss and infection. Thanks to their carrion diet, their saliva is rich enough in bacteria to seriously weaken prey, and recent studies show that they may also possess venom. In addition, dragons can loosen their jaws, stretch their throats and secrete a lubricating red slime to swallow some corpses completely whole.", "title": "Top 10 Dangerous  Lizards in The World", "publishedDate": "2012-06-29T07:44:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IWG7Afe9mk", "description": "Anatomy 105", "title": "Sheep kidney", "publishedDate": "2011-10-04T13:47:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IWSPaBu5Wg", "description": "There's a lot to do at Oregon State University.

The minimum number of in-circuit connections makes it possible to improve dramatically the reliability of microelectronic devices. The second task is to reduce the cost of microelectronic circuits and electronic devices. This problem is solved by forming during a single technological cycle structures of different elements, inter-element compounds and pads for many integrated circuits on a relatively large semiconductor wafer, or on an insulating base with the subsequent division into crystals and boards of integrated circuits, respectively. By structural and technological criterion semiconductor and hybrid integrated circuits are distinguished. The main active elements of semiconductor integrated circuits can be bipolar transistors or FETs. Variants of structures of semiconductor integrated circuits with different passive components implementation are presented in the following figure. Individual elements, necessary for operation of the circuit, are connected by means of thin metal strips, spread onto the oxidized surface of the crystal. The figure also shows the equivalent circuit of these structures. The structure of hybrid integrated circuit may include transistors and diodes, as well as entire semiconductor integrated circuits. Passive elements of hybrid integrated circuits are usually made on a glassceramic, ceramic or glass substrate by applying different dielectric, resistive and metal films. On the same substrate the inter-element and inter-component connections, as well as pads, are implemented. For the very same equivalent circuit the structure of the hybrid chip will look like this. Design and manufacture of hybrid circuits is advisable for solving specific, particular problems with a relatively small number of required products.", "title": "Integrated circuit: Structure", "publishedDate": "2011-10-14T23:19:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IZGzLaMmEc", "description": "", "title": "OPERA\u00c7\u00c3O HYGEIA ATUALIZA 08-04 JORNAL DE MATO GROSSO", "publishedDate": "2010-04-08T23:30:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IZMc0G2P2s", "description": "cute :3\n\nfrom www.rinr.fsu.edu/rockrat/", "title": "Laotian rock rat", "publishedDate": "2009-10-27T22:43:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IZcMDOw1W8", "description": "Featuring original music by Christian Saglie.

That doesn't necessarily mean it all fell into the sea. NASA's calculations had predicted that the former climate research satellite would fall over a 500-mile swath.  The two government agencies say the 35-foot satellite fell sometime between 11:23 p.m. EDT and 1:09 a.m. EDT.  NASA said it didn't know the precise time or location yet. Some 26 pieces of the satellite \u00e2\u20ac\" representing 1,200 pounds of heavy metal \u00e2\u20ac\" were expected to rain down somewhere.  The biggest surviving chunk should be no more than 300 pounds. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is the biggest NASA spacecraft to crash back to Earth, uncontrolled, since the post-Apollo 75-ton Skylab space station and the more than 10-ton Pegasus 2 satellite, both in 1979.  Russia's 135-ton Mir space station slammed through the atmosphere in 2001, but it was a controlled dive into the Pacific. Before UARS fell, no one had ever been hit by falling space junk and NASA expected that not to change.  NASA put the chances that somebody somewhere on Earth would get hurt at 1-in-3,200.

Pueden levantar las primeras dos espinas dorsales: la primera asegura y la segunda desasegura. Esta acci\u00f3n previene que depredadores les traguen o les saquen de sus agujeros. Este mecanismo es el que origina su nombre en lengua inglesa Triggerfish (peces \"gatillo\").\n \nTienen una peque\u00f1a aleta pectoral, fusionada a una espina. A diferencia de los peces de la familia Monacanthidae (del griego \"una sola espina\"), la espina de los Balistidae se puede sostener con una segunda espina y as\u00ed hacer que el pez parezca m\u00e1s amenazador al depredador. Sus ojos peque\u00f1os, situadas encima de su cabeza grande, pueden moverse independientemente. Tienen la piel muy dura, cubierta de escamas romboideas que les proveen una armadura bastante resistente. Su cabeza, grande y angular, termina en un hocico con fauces fuertes y dientes afilados, hechos para romper conchas. Cada quijada tiene una fila de ocho dientes, mientras la mand\u00edbula tiene otro juego de seis dientes como placas.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los Balistidae son solitarios y diurnos. Se alimentan invertebrados de conchas duras, y algunos se alimentan de zooplancton grande o algas. Ponen sus huevos en un agujero peque\u00f1o, cavado en el suelo. Algunas especies cuidan sus huevos.\n \nAlgunas especies pueden volverse bastante agresivas durante la temporada de reproducci\u00f3n. En particular, el Rhinecanthus aculeatus y el Balistoides viridescens defienden sus nidos circulares con sa\u00f1a contra cualquier intruso, incluyendo buzos. Su territorio se extiende en forma de cono del nido hasta la superficie, de manera que nadar hacia arriba lleva a uno m\u00e1s adentro de su territorio. Alejarse horizontalmente del nido es la mejor forma de salir del problema. En contraste con el Rhinecanthus aculeatus, que es relativamente peque\u00f1o, el Balistoides viridescens supone una amenaza seria al buzo desatento por su gran tama\u00f1o y sus dientes fuertes.\n \nAlgunas especies de Balistidae hacen un sonido como un gru\u00f1ido al sacarlas del agua.", "title": "PESCA SAN CARLOS NUEVO GUAYMAS PEZ COCHITO", "publishedDate": "2012-03-24T06:35:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3IlCr2W3XDw", "description": "This is a pet food dish which sends SMS text messages when the dish is low on food.

As Brad points out, you will always have to cut the floor to length. He cautions to always wear eye protection and an N-95 dust mask, unless you're using a \"dustless\" cutter like professionals use. He recommends that you should always cut outside your home.\n\nBrad shows the correct and incorrect saw blades for comparison. You should use a carbide-fiber tipped saw blade with a high tooth-count. Depending on the size of the saw you're using, the tooth-count could go up over 100. \n\nThe teeth of the saw blade should come in contact with the face of the product. By sawing that way, you reduce chipping. However, chipping is a minor concern because the end that you saw will be hidden under the quarter-round or other trim at the base of the wall or transition.\n\nRemember, laminate flooring is very hard, so you may need more than one blade to finish your project. Even a carbide-tipped saw blade will dull significantly cutting through laminate flooring. If you use a chop saw, you may see sparks and smoke. That's because you're sawing through the aluminum oxide wear layer, one of the hardest coatings there is.

After the first two tournaments, our team looked back on our successes and failures. What had ultimately failed us at the first tournament? Autonomous. What cost us semifinals at our second tournament, despite being first seed? Autonomous. We quickly realized that to stay relevant in the current season, we desperately needed to come up with a solution to our lackluster autonomous programs.\n\nOur solution? Rerun. Rather than taking the traditional approach of hours of tuning and reprogramming autonomous programs, we decided to take \"non-driver control\" to the next level. After all, wasn't our team all about trying new and innovative solutions? We mapped out the new way we were going to run autonomous. Our first attempt at recording an autonomous program was the simplest way possible. We'd record the motor values we were applying every 50 milliseconds and simply replay them. Soon, however, as our batteries drained, so did our accuracy, but not our morale! We came up with a new solution. Using a much-better tuned PID drive control system and more careful driving, we came up with rerun 2.0.\n\nWe brought rerun 2.0 to our third tournament of the season. We won the autonomous bonus almost every match with our complex \"autonomous\" maneuvers that were otherwise nearly impossible to program with traditional methods. No team stood any chance to our new autonomous \"programming\". We won all our matches and attained first seed. We then went on to win the tournament.\n\nWhile programming and testing rerun, we discovered a useful bug (or unexpected feature), which we have since dubbed \"active brake\". Because of our new \"open loop\" PID control system, we discovered that repositioning was nearly impossible, since the robot would always push back with just the right amount of force to stay put. That sparked a new idea in us. We quickly realized that repositioning was essentially the same as pushing. If we couldn't reposition, then we couldn't be pushed! An hour or so of programming later, active brake became a reality. When we let go of our joysticks and allowed our robot to sit still, it would turn on active brake and resist all attempts from other robots to push us.
