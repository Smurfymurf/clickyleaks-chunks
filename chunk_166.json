I ran out of time so i put them in really fast.\n\nNOTES ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT - i ran out of time so i had to omit some important specs about the experiment:\n\n1) The experiment is meant to test several fluids if possible: water, alcohol, oil, soda, milk, sea water and mercury (if permitted)\n\n2) IF YOU WATCHED THE DIAGRAMS CLOSELY: you should have noticed the existence of a VACUUM OR PRESSURE PUMP. To make the experiment more interesting, a pressure pump could be attached to the sealed cylinder and create more varied conditions for the fluids. This could help on obtaining better results, as pressure changes the values of density inside the cylinder.\n\n3) The \"needle\" from which fluids come out, can also be a plastic tube (with a small diameter) or any other hollow tube. The purpose of the small diameter is to mantain surface tension on the liquid sphere as to not get separated from the tube and let other fluids in.\n\nthank you ^^\n\nMORE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW-  As liquids are left out in the spacecraft's cabin, they float freely, that's when they adopt spherical shapes or similar to bubbles. (Why? In space, gravity is almost cero, so the only force acting on the liquid is SURFACE TENSION; the only way for the liquid to accommodate is in the shape of a sphere. The geometry of the fluid is issued as a way it represents a minimum in energy: surface tension.\n\nWhat is 'Plexiglass'? Poly(methyl methacrylate) is commonly known as plexiglass (it's a trademark) which is a strong and resistant substitute for glass. It is transparent and has close properties to a plastic. Common uses of PMMA are: aquarium glass, automovile headlights, expectator protection in hockey rinks, riot police protection, etc. So now you know what Plexiglass is!\n\nANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIAGRAMS PLEASE FEEL FREE ASK ME (:", "title": "Youtube Space Lab Entry - Fluid Density in Outer Space (Sphere Machine)", "publishedDate": "2011-12-14T06:54:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "9TDU1s76gBo", "description": "\u306e\u3069\u304c\u6e07\u3044\u305f\u306e\u304b\u3001\u6c34\u3092\u30da\u30ed\u30da\u30ed\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u3084\u3064\u3067\u3059\uff3e\uff3e", "title": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30d8\u30d3\u3000\u6c34\u3092\u98f2\u3080\u30b8\u30a7\u30df\u30cb\u30fc", "publishedDate": "2011-09-20T12:55:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9TDsbFYSkP0", "description": "Trials Custom Track Competition entry\nCreator - DudozinoUziko\nTrack - Tomorrow's Suburb", "title": "Trials CTC - DudozinoUziko \"Tomorrow's Suburb\"", "publishedDate": "2013-02-22T00:09:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "9TE5mS-P3nk", "description": "Smile's last performence.

In Europe, the custom dates to the end of the 16th century.\n\n\nStep 1: Fasten kippah to head\nFasten the kippah to your head with bobby pins or hair clips. Larger ones can sit on the head without fasteners, though they may fall off during intense activity. These are best for bald men.\n\nTip\nWhen visiting a synagogue or attending a Jewish wedding or other ceremony, non-Jewish men may be given yarmulkes to wear for the service. \n\nStep 2: For Orthodox men ...\nOrthodox men generally wear the skullcap at all times. \n\nStep 3: For Conservative men ...\nConservative men generally wear the kippah during prayer and at synagogue. \n\nStep 4: For Reform men ...\nFor Reform men, the kippah is generally optional.\n\nStep 5: Remove when bathing or swimming\nWhen bathing or swimming, remove the kippah.\n\nStep 6: Jewish women\nSome Jewish women, mainly Reform, also wear the kippah.\n\nDid You Know?\nSome scholars believe the word yarmulke derives from the Aramaic for 'one who fears God.'", "title": "How to Wear a Kippah (Yarmulke)", "publishedDate": "2009-08-03T14:24:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "9TO1t4BzBDk", "description": "A 2008 British commercial for Stella Artois.\n\nCasanova story.

E' qui ripreso durante alcune fasi di caccia tipiche di questi straordinari cefalopodi. Da notare, in particolare, quando ricerca bivalvi o granchi infossati nella sabbia attorcigliando in profondit\u00e0 i suoi lunghi tentacoli. I polpi, di norma, predano pesci in et\u00e0 pi\u00f9 matura, pertanto non deve meravigliare la loro tranquilla presenza anche nelle sue vicinanze. Rispetto al polpo comune (Octopus vulgaris), l'Octopus macropus \u00e8 particolarmente infastidito dalle luci, possiede infatti una membrana che protegge gli occhi molto sviluppata, e in cattivit\u00e0 risulta interagire con l'essere umano in misura minore. Anatomicamente, una delle pi\u00f9 interessanti differenzazioni riguarda la colorazione di questo polpo, la quale appare quando si sente aggredito rosso ferruginosa maculata di bianco, probabilmente per incutere nel nemico il timore che esso sia velenoso.

As you perform the exercise you will also be engaging your glutes, hamstrings, lower back, and traps.  Your calves and spine erectors will be engaged as well to help you stabilize your body throughout the exercise.\n\nIf you are having a hard time with this exercise, it could be due inflexibility of your hips.  As you perform the Jefferson Squat, alternate which hand is grabbing the bar in front of your body to bring out any inflexibility you might have.  For me, I seem to have a harder time with my left arm in front of my body.  \n\nThe only way you can improve is to see what needs improvement! #HTH #SHFAthelte  \n\nAdd 3 -- 4 sets of 10-12 reps to your next leg work out!\n\nADD THIS EXERCISE TO YOUR SHF PROFILE!\nhttps://www.scotthermanfitness.com/m_exercise.php?pageAction=DISPLAY&Rid=1049\n\nSHF Browser App- Don't Miss My Next Video!\nhttp://myapp.wips.com/scotthermanfitness-extension\n\nCheck out my BSN Profile!\nhttp://www.bsnonline.net/biography/scott_herman.html\n\nNeed to soundproof your studio?\nhttp://www.atsacoustics.com/shy\n\nStart building more strength today!

Die Epiphyten sitzen bzw. haften nur auf oder an dem Substrat wie zum Beispiel B\u00e4umen, ohne ihnen im Gegensatz zu Schmarotzern in irgendeiner Weise N\u00e4hrstoffe zu entziehen. Diese Wuchsform ist auch bei Orchideen und Bromelien stark verbreitet. Bei den epiphytischen Landfarnen sind oft so genannte Mantel- oder Nischenbl\u00e4tter ausgebildet. Diese Nischenbl\u00e4tter sterben ab, sobald ein neues nachw\u00e4chst, und verrotten selbst auch zu Humus.\nEpiphytische Farne wachsen wie auch die Kletter- und Baumfarne haupts\u00e4chlich in den tropischen Urw\u00e4ldern. Kletterfarne wie Lygodium scandens winden sich mit ihren Wedeln an anderen B\u00e4umen oder \u00e4hnlichen St\u00fctzen empor. Diese rankende Wuchsform entsteht durch die st\u00e4ndig weiter wachsenden Wedelspitzen - ganz im Gegensatz zu den anderen Wuchsarten, die nicht mehr wachsen, wenn sie ihre jeweils typische Gr\u00f6\u00dfe erreicht haben.

News of such events spread like wildfire on the internet. People who do bad things are finding it harder to hide. Recently, some Internet users compiled information on several well-known public events and turned them into doggerel, to poke fun at the local officials.\n\nhttp://bbs.city.tianya.cn/tianyacity/content/47/1/1302046.shtml\nRecently, behind the popular Sina Microblog, Ten New Warnings of the Chinese Bureaucracy, each warning reflects those notorious events seen from public websites.\nFor instance, don't talk nonsense while doing an interview; don't smoke expensive cigarettes at a business meeting; don't wear a luxury watch while socializing with businessmen; don't drive a luxury car while on official business; don't hold up an umbrella while having grass-root inspections; don't be a copycat when writing an article; don't Twitter through Sina Microblog while dating; don't keep a diary while dilly-dallying with prostitutes; don't smile when disaster strikes, and don't be a news spokesman when unexpected events occur.\n\nThe dramatic events that have taken place in China over the past two years, have demonstrated the tremendous power of the Sina Microblog, like the Qian Yun-hui event, the Li-gang event, the Kuo Mei-mei event, and the most publicized event so far, the bullet train collision in east China's Zhejiang Province. The authorities there were forced to quickly respond after bloggers questioned them about specific details of the collision.\n\nFigure Blog editor, Wang Songxing: \"In recent years, there are corrupt Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials, or so-called 'government officials,'everywhere you look. Many of them busy themselves with a variety of profligate behaviors. A website is like a mirror which reflects everyone's behavior. Everyone should think before they leap because there are so many Internet users who are concerned about everything that is happening in the world.\n\nScholars believe that microblogging networks are on the rise, which is like two sides of a coin. The good thing about these networks is that there is nothing to hide under the sun on the Internet. The bad thing is that the CCP still controls 500 million Internet users. However, one commentary published in the Outlook Newsweek, said that some officials have argued that many grass-roots CCP cadres still treat the highly open, interactive, involving Internet public opinion site as the traditional media. The latter would surely be defeated in the \"storm\" of the new media.\n\nChen Yong-miao, a Constitutional scholar: \"Local government officials think that they can control everything. They feel most secure when they're able to control or suppress public opinion. But they will quickly panic when they realize that public opinion on the Internet is beyond their control.\n\nhttp://www.hellotw.com/dlxw/zhqt/201109/t20110929_686551.htm\nAccording to new statistics released by the Chinese Internet Information Office on Sept. 29, Chinese mainland Internet users have exceeded 500 million. Internet penetration rate is close to 40%. About half of Chinese Internet users share their information via social networking.\n\nhttp://news.cn.yahoo.com/ypen/20111003/620750.html\nDuring a media interview, Outlook Newsweek citied Internet management officials as saying: \"The biggest problem the current group of cadres is now facing is that they have various degrees of fear and depression when coming face-to-face with the Internet.\n\nChen Yong-miao, a Constitutional scholar: \"I said several years ago that online media is like a virtual Tiananmen Square. The reason why Sino Microblog can play a little role in Chinese politics is mainly becauase the central government's attempt to control over local government. As a matter of fact, Sino Microblog and other Internet medias, are like biting dogs released by the central government. Since all material and equipment is in the CCP's hands, they can pull out your line if a big crisis occurs. They will simply shut down your Internet.\"\n\nNanfang Daily had recently reported that the thought of \"official-oriented\" makes many incompetent corrupt officials sit back and relax, as long as they can hide their corruption. In fact, when controversial events occur, Internet bloggers keep searching for the truth. This is not the evasive response from the government media can cover.\n\nNTD reporters Zhang Li Na, Huang Rong and Xue Li\n\n\u300a\u795e\u97f5\u300b2011\u4e16\u754c\u5de1\u6f14\u65b0\u4eae\u70b9\nhttp://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/", "title": "10 New Warnings Regarding China's Bureaucracy", "publishedDate": "2011-10-05T11:58:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9U2pLDErtrM", "description": "Hollyoaks Ester & Kim kissing in the hostpital", "title": "whats all that about snogging", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T22:04:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9U3CONhEbaA", "description": "Check out us at:http://chemistry.tutorvista.com/inorganic-chemistry/osmosis.html\n\nOsmosis\n\nOsmosis is a special type of diffusion concerned with liquids.

Drawn close together is etymologically connected to the word purse, as the meaning of money, such as disbursement and reimbursement, because the bur part of the word is the origin of the pur sound in purse. The owl on the dollar bill is on the net background which symbolizes the weight of the gold held in the note of exchange. The Pleiades are esoterically known as the sound br and that is why the word purse, meaning money comes from the word bursa which is seen as the hide of Taurus that holds the Pleiades. The Pleiades are seen esoterically as the world market and this is why the stock exchange is called the bourse. The Pleiades set in the antipodal position 180 degrees around the zodiac in the scales of Libra that hold the measure of money and the Pleiades symbolize measurement  esoterically. \nThe three edifices marked at positions forming an isosceles triangle in Washington DC are the Jefferson memorial, the White House and the capitol building at the apex. These three positions represent the three stars  the great cyon star Sirius, Procyon and Alcyone as the apex. Alcyone is in the middle of the Pleiades and thus the capitol represents a place where the people of democracy meet. The owl over the top is the owl of Egypt over the Pleiades. \nThe Bohemian Grove Owl sets on a fire because the Pleiades are the great symbol of fire on earth from heaven.  If the owl is 42 ft high, this means the 42 days between  the culmination of Sirius and that of the Pleiades.

They are omnivorous foragers and feed on insects, worms, crustaceans and fish. They are not a migratory species, but do travel to seek out conditions conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall. Red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense, but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior. Acoustic communication is common, and is sometimes exhibited along with aggressive behaviors. At this time, the red-bellied piranha is not considered to be a threatened species by the IUCN, and therefore, there are no conservation strategies in place to target this species. Through media influence, the red-bellied piranha has developed a reputation as a ferocious predator, though this is not actually the case. They are a popular aquarium fish.\n\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\nThe red-bellied piranha belongs to the subfamily Serrasalminae, which is a group of medium to large-sized characids and includes other closely related omnivores such as pacus. They are characterized by deep, lateral compressed bodies and long dorsal fins.[3] Within the subfamily, red-bellied piranhas fall into the genera Pygocentrus, which is distinguished by the unusual dentition and differing head width dimensions. The red-bellied piranha is considered to be highly carnivorous, while most non-piranhas in the family are primarily herbivorous. However, it should be noted that red-bellied piranha is actually omnivorous.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe red-bellied piranha is distributed widely throughout the South American continent and is found in the Neotropical freshwater rivers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. They live in the warm freshwater drainages of several major rivers including the Amazon, Rio Paraguay, Rio Paran\u00e1 and Rio Essequibo, as well as numerous smaller systems. It is acclimated to waters that are between 15 and 35 \u00b0C and have a pH of 6 to 7 and is typically found in white water rivers and some freshwater streams and lakes. In the Brazilian Amazon, the red-bellied piranha may sometimes inhabit flooded forests.", "title": "Pygocentrus nattereri red-bellied red piranha", "publishedDate": "2014-10-06T19:45:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9U748MRoSLM", "description": "me just practicing drums", "title": "Drum beater 1", "publishedDate": "2011-01-15T19:04:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "9U81RoQuZmA", "description": "Real Madrid vs Barcelona 1-0 Legends Cup 2014 Assistence Luis Figo Goal Edwin Congo", "title": "Real Madrid vs Barcelona 1-0 Legends Cup 2014 Assistence Luis Figo Goal Edwin Congo", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T13:48:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9U8BFAQ5C08", "description": "Umbrella Tree - Schefflera actinophylla HD 02 by Laborator TEBA\nOferta Speciala - plante si seminte de vanzare     http://www.albizia.ro/\n+40 74 782 1314    /    074 782 1314\nUmbrela Tree - Schefflera actinophylla Scientific classification:\nAngiosperms\nEudicots\nAsterids\nOrder: Apiales\nFamily: Araliaceae\nGenus: Schefflera\nSpecies: S. actinophylla\nBotanical name: Schefflera actinophylla\nSynonyms: Brassaia actinophylla\nCommon names:\nQueensland umbrella tree\noctopus tree\namate\nUnul din marile avantaje este ca poate fi crescut in ghiveci si pe timp de iarna poate fi adus in casa sau apartament.

The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (C. dromedarius), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; and the bactrian, or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus), which inhabits Central Asia. Both species have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.\n\nThe term \"camel\" is derived via Latin and Greek (camelus and kam\u0113los respectively) from Hebrew or Phoenician g\u0101m\u0101l, possibly from a verb root meaning to bear or carry (related to Arabic jamala).\n\n\"Camel\" is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae: the two true camels: the dromedary and bactrian, and the four South American camelids: the llama and alpaca are called \"New World camels\", while the guanaco and vicu\u00f1a are called \"South American camels\".\n\n\nSource :- Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

For decades Bill Labov and his colleagues have been studying how Americans talk. The result is a whole library of recorded voices and a fascinating discovery. It's called the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. Labov believes there is a revolutionary shift in the pronunciation of short vowels that have been relatively stable for a thousand years.\n\nBL: What we'll be looking at is this mass of cities around the Great Lakes. Here we have Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and Cleveland, Detroit.\n\nRM: How many people is that?\n\nBL: It's about 34 million people. This area used to be the closest to network pronunciation. It was what the NBC standard was based on. And today it is moving further and further away.\n\nRM: Let's go into that in some detail. Show us how that's happening.\n\nBL: In these experiments, we played first of all an individual word.\n\nComputer: \"Black\".\n\nBL: And then, people had to write down what they thought they heard. So, you could do that yourself. What do you hear?\n\nRM: \"Black\".\n\nBL: And then, in another series they heard:\n\nComputer: \"Living on one black\".\n\nBL: Now what do you hear?\n\nRM: \"Block\".\n\nBL: Well, you change your mind.\n\nComputer: \"Old senior citizens living on one black\".\n\nBL: This person is saying the word \"block\" the way they say \"black\".\n\nRM: The shift in this one vowel seems to have a domino effect on the other four vowels, and they all change too. The result can be serious misunderstandings.\n\nBL: Now, this is spectacular.\n\nComputer: \"Bosses\".\n\nBL: Everybody writes down what?\n\nRM: \"Bosses\".\n\nBL: Right. The guy.\n\nComputer: \"The bosses with the antennas\".\n\nBL: Now you begin to wonder. What are these \"bosses with antennas\"?\n\nRM: \"Bosses with the antennas\".\n\nBL: Right.\n\nComputer: \"I can remember vaguely when we had the buses with the antennas on the top\".\n\nRM: So, \"buses\" has become \"bosses\".\n\nBL: Right. And so, this is very hard for most people to recognize.\n\nRM: So, is it fair to say that North Americans are, in different regions, are growing further apart from each other linguistically?\n\nBL: It seems so. It's hard to believe. Everyone says to us, we all watch the same radio and television. How can that be? It's a very suprising finding.\n----\nFrom the documentary \"Do you speak American?\".", "title": "Northern Cities Vowel Shift", "publishedDate": "2008-04-27T20:49:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9UoLH2mwHzc", "description": "What a fitting way to end the season!

The disease gets its name from the shape of the red blood cells under low oxygen conditions. Some red blood cells become sickle-shaped and these elongated cells get stuck in small blood vessels so that parts of the body don't get the oxygen they need. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single letter change in the DNA. This in turn alters one of the amino acids in the hemoglobin protein. Valine sits in a position where glutamic acid should be. The valine makes the hemoglobin molecules stick together when oxygen tension is low, forming long fibers that distort the shape of the red blood cells, and this brings on an attack.\"\n\nEssential Cell Biology, Second Edition\nby Alberts, Bray, Hopkin, Johnson, Lewis, Raff, Roberts, Walter\ncopyright 2004 by Garland Science Publishing", "title": "Sickle Cell", "publishedDate": "2009-04-12T05:04:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Uq8lLgnDc4", "description": "This is just a quick video to show how easy it is to remove bird droppings with the Optima Steamer without scratching the paint", "title": "Removing bird droppings from 2013 C250 coupe with the Optima steamer", "publishedDate": "2014-05-12T19:03:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "9UqDRV4peJs", "description": "All u need is rubber bands like what u use for loom", "title": "Lps: how to make lps bows (easy)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T20:09:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9UqqpiYn2sk", "description": "I do not own the audio.

It was built in Germany under the leadership of ExtraEnergy for Taiwan Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). In 2007, the lab was shipped to Taiwan in order to help to check safety of battery packs in a quick and cost effective way, also in Asia.\n\nVideo of BATSO Tests\nITRI records all tests on video. This video shows, how different batteries can react on crush, external short circuit, and overcharge:\n\n    crush test (mechanical failure): Mechanical damage of a battery can occur e.g. within an accident or when it is dropped on the ground.This can easily cause an internal short circuit which can result into an even more dangerous situation than an external circuit.\n    external circuit test: Discharge of the whole battery occurs. This can result into overheating or explosion. Glowing cable connections can cause combustion, too.\n    overcharge test: Overcharge might occur when the battery charger doesn`t stop pumping energy into an already fully charged battery.\n\nBATSO Workshop 2012 - Free downloads\n\"Checks for crush and overcharge are the tests where most batteries fail\", informed Sven-Olaf Steinke, General Manager T\u00dcV Rheinland (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. at the BATSO workshop 2012 in Taiwan.

Beloved for her trend-setting fashion designs as well as her political activism, Georgiana's fire and wit make her a beloved figure everywhere but her own home, where her cold and distant husband's control over her is stifling, soon sending her into the arms of a another man -- an act that soon forces her to learn about the brutal difference in the rights afforded to 18th century men and women.\n\n\"the duchess\",\"the duchess clip\",\"the duchess part 1\",\"the duchess trailer\",\"keira knightley\",\"dominic cooper\",\"saul dibb\",\"flyer videos\",\"romantic dramas\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"united kingdom\",\"david m thompson\",\"cameron mccracken\",\"christine langan\",\"colleen woodcock\",\"jill tandy\",\"carolyn marks blackwood\",\"gabrielle tana\",\"alexandra arlango\",\"andrew semans\",\"adultery videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++374434,/m/0ksncg,/m/01l2fn", "title": "The Duchess (6/9) Movie CLIP - A Trip To Bath (2008) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T18:24:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "9V35yJm0a9k", "description": "Nov. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell could be on the verge of a promotion to Majority Leader.... if he can win his own race for re-election.

These polymers are functionalized in the side chains with recognition units and can, after folding into a well-defined object, express specific functions, such as sensing or catalysis. \nThe recognition unit of choice is the chiral benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) motif equipped with a photo-labile protecting group, which prevents aggregation. Upon the irradiation of ultraviolet light, BTAs self-assemble into helical stacks stabilized by threefold intermolecular hydrogen bonding (highlighted with a purple glow). The cooperative self-assembly of dangling BTAs as side chains offered detailed information on the folding behavior and the inner structure of the polymeric nanoparticles as revealed by CD spectroscopy.\nControlled folding was obtained by photo-deprotection and with the aid of heating/cooling steps (red/blue background). At room temperature, the system resides in a kinetically trapped or collapsed state; a unimolecular glass or \"molten globule\" state. The more thermodynamically favorable folded state was achieved by an additional heating/cooling step. At high temperatures, the polymer backbone is more flexible. Slowly reducing the temperature induces BTA aggregation because there is sufficient mobility within the polymer to adopt an optimal conformation for self-assembly to occur.\n\nFor more information see:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201100104\n\nAnimation: ICMS Animation Studio\nVoice-over: Matthew F.

It is situated towards the end of a narrow strip of land lying between the Adriatic Sea and Italy's border with Slovenia, which lies almost immediately south, east and north of the city. Trieste is located at the head of the Gulf of Trieste and throughout history it has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of Germanic, Latin and Slavic cultures. In 2009, it had a population of about 205,000[1] and it is the capital of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trieste province.\n\nTrieste was one of the oldest parts of the Habsburg Monarchy from 1382 until 1918. In the 19th century, it was the most important port of one of the Great Powers of Europe. As a prosperous seaport in the Mediterranean region, Trieste became the fourth largest city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (after Vienna, Budapest, and Prague). In the fin-de-siecle period, it emerged as an important hub for literature and music. However, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Trieste's union to Italy after World War I led to some decline of its \"mittleuropean\" cultural and commercial importance. Even if it enjoyed an economic revival during the 1930s, after WWII it suffered because of the border changes and, throughout the Cold War, Trieste was a peripheral city of western Europe. Today, the city is in one of the richest regions of Italy, and has been a great center for shipping, through its port (Port of Trieste), Shipbuilding and financial services.SOURCE:WIKIPEDIA", "title": "Trieste - Adriatic Sea - Italy", "publishedDate": "2011-01-02T14:52:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VFJJSSVFkY", "description": "Mostly Pacey storylines from Season 4.", "title": "Pacey - 410 Self Reliance part 2 (Dialogue)", "publishedDate": "2007-06-18T17:50:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VFtaFzC1O8", "description": "Papugi faliste i go\u0142\u0105bki diamentowe we wsp\u00f3lnej wolierce.", "title": "Go\u0142\u0105bki diamentowe i Papu\u017cki faliste (Geopelia cuneata)(Melopsittacus undulatus)", "publishedDate": "2012-05-10T19:39:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VG09O3_GRY", "description": "The official TV commercial for Red Dead Redemption.

Pasadena Ca is a very Powerful City - But We the People have access to records - Cameras - and the internet to post the progress of what is really happening right beneath our feet in this City of Hoses. Google \"2194 Corson\" \u00a0\"2194 Jon Pollard\" - \"2194 Eric Walsh\" - \"Ofelia Cavazos Edmondson\" - \"2194\" on Concepts and Org s. to see a wide array of Proof on this serious subject. I couldn't believe my eyes. This is Here in Pasadena. Proof that Nazi's are ruining the City.\n\u00a0 \u00a0If this was just 1 family that was devastated by the City's poor attempt to Fix the fumes from its buried holding sites on the yard of 2194.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Watch the cutting of the ground to see the layers that Wildan made at the cost of all who are in the area.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 View the 2194 Corson Videos - Documents etc. Especially The e mails sent from the City Directors directly to 2194 corson St. 91107 - These are the heads of the departments whom are running our city into the SEWER. Or Rather Raising the Sewer to the City. They Do Not Live in Pasadena Ca. The people running Pasadena \"City Council Members- Dept. Heads- Mayor - JPL Execs, Do not live in Pasadena Ca. So hiding The J.P.L. Oak Grove Park E.P.A. Superfund Site all around J.P.L. - INC. Devils Gate, Chaney trail, Flintridge, La Canada, Down to the sea right through Alhambra and Malibu. For over 20 years now the governing body of Pasadena Ca., Has Hid a Federally declared Superfund Site from the very public it serves by First erecting a Park \u00a0\"Oak Grove Park - on Oak Grove St. in the first place. This is where J.P.L. washes its chemicals with the streams flowing through the mountains. Although it was determined to be one of the largest and most dangerous toxic hazardous sites in the entire country by people who really know about such things - The E.P.A. So HOW was Pasadena City Council able to Hide this site as well as steal all the monies from the cleanup? MASSIVE PAYOFFS. JPL never had to modify it's manufacturing techniques - Therefore it can pass those savings on to the Politicians who Protect JPL at the peril of its's Citizens. Look People what ins in charge of your life - your child's life \u00a0-people down the street - across town - floating into the Ocean. \u00a0the Good luck with the new BAG TAX in Pasadena to FIX THE ENVIRONMENT - This City is literally being crapped on by the non elected leaders whom neither live here or drink the water. If gross city negligence was at fault here I would blame it on straight up GREED. But what do you attribute to the fact that these people not only knew about the toxins flowing into our homes through the Chemical product rocket and Bomb Factory J.P.L. Pasadena CA. But what if YOU found out that Pasadena Ca had crafted it's entire health Dept. to be a sophisticated Media manipulator as well as an ought-right killing machine. These \"people\" have taken the next step of greed and ARE profiteering on a whole sale level of making people sick so they can be easily victimized and abused by this Beautiful Affluent City of Roses being run by MAD PEOPLE. Why is this City giving us soccer parks instead of clean water? Miss apportion of funds is a far cry from the planed soft killing of citizens until the entire City is a privatized toxic waste dump housing the worlds largest leper colony. THIS WILL MATTER IN 100 years from now. They LIED to us and said \"it's too late\" because THEY do not want to change the way rocket fuel etc is made using Mother Earth as a sponge and you a slave to medication and anything that offers comfort and relief. Do you know why Tiny tim's quote \"God Bless Us Everyone\" is so important? It's because we are all in this together.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So - start combing through the City Council meetings and repost the interesting stuff- Tag it with \"D.O.J.\"(U.S. Dept. 'O Justus [they look} 2194 corson, what this tiny but powerful group of people is doing is called soft kill murder. They have gotten away with this by using dark forces on peoples minds - Perchlorate in the water supply with a side of VOC's, lead and the other GARBAGE Pasadena sees fit to feed us - Sure not many drink the water so much BUT how many of us shower by having fresh Perrier dumped over our pampered heads. And what about swimming? I know I check my Pool every other day for the slow accumulations of heavy non evaporating dissolved heavy metals and toxins washed into the aquifer.

It may refer to only the mansion (the 340-room main building) that has the President's official residence and offices; it may also refer to the entire 130 hectare (320 acre) President Estate that includes huge gardens (Mughal Gardens), residences of bodyguards and staff, other offices, stables and open spaces. The Rashtrapati Bhavan is a large and vast mansion with four floors and has 340 rooms. It is built on a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). It faces east. A straight east-west road, Rajpath (called King's Way or Kingsway by the British), starts from the huge square, Vijay Chowk, in front of Rashtrapati Bhavan and ends at India Gate on the western end of the road. North Avenue and South Avenue are two approach roads north and south of the estate in perfect symmetry. The east-west road (Rajpath) out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan is flanked by the two huge Central Secretariat buildings (North and South Blocks) that house various ministries of the Government of India. The Parliament House is located at eastern end of North Block.\n\nThe plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its own court areas within. This wing was so large that the first Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live the smaller guest wing, a tradition that has since been followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.\n\nThe centre of the main wing of the building, underneath the main dome, is the Durbar Hall, which was known as the Throne Room during British rule when it had thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine (his wife). The interior of this room and almost all the rooms of the palace are bare, relying on stonework and shapes to show austerity rather than intricate decoration. In the hall, the columns are made in Delhi order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The hall has a 2-ton chandelier which hangs from a 33-metre height. The two state drawing rooms, the state supper room and the state library are each on the four corners of the hall. \n\nThere are also other rooms such as many loggias (galleries with open air on one side) which face out into the courtyards, a large dining hall with an extremely long table, sitting rooms, billiards rooms, and a large ball room, and staircases. Water features are also through the palace, such as near the Viceroy's stairs, which has eight marble lion statues spilling water into six basins. These lions were symbolic of the heraldry of Great Britain. There is also an open area in one room to the sky, which lets in much of the natural light.\n \nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

In your side step, you're just going to be stepping out from side to side, in a squat position. You're going to start off with your feet shoulder width apart. That's squatting down. Make sure your knees are aligned with your ankles. You're going to stay at this height the entire time, so you're not going to pop up and down. You're going to stay one height the entire time. You're going to shuffle your feet out from side to side. You're going to skip together, take one foot out, and make sure when you take that foot out the leg stays straight. You keep all the weight on one side. You step back together, take it up. So, in and out. In and out. \n\nEvery time you shuffle, make sure that the weight stays on the leg that's bent. The leg that's bent, the knee is aligned with the ankle and the weight is back in that heel, so you're really going to feel this deep in the glute and the hamstring in the back of the leg, and also in that quad area. You can start off with those feet together, step out to the side, shuffle to the side, shuffle to the side making sure to stay tone height  the entire time, not popping up and down. You really keep the tension on those legs. Again, this is also great exercise for cardio and toning effect. You can take this exercise a little bit faster. Staying nice  and low, take it out, take it out, take it out, just like that.

Cheap synths will always sound flat and dated in ways that not even the venerable Mellotron can match, and bad new-wave keyboard washes upstage the most earnest Velvets/Beatles/Byrds ripoffs. Like the old saw goes, it's all in the mix.\n\nI bought those Let's Active reissues last summer and was appalled: \"I used to listen to this unicorny shit? Ech.\" After similarly unsatisfying re-encounters with The Rain Parade, Three O'Clock, Thin White Rope, Vietnam Veterans, Robyn Hitchcock & The Egyptians, early Screaming Trees, etc., I was ready to write the whole 80s neo-psych-cum-roots-rock movement off as a necessarily naive but ball-less forerunner of grunge, Terrastock, Elephant 6 and all the other genres and scenes of the 1990s in which bands figured out how to recreate-- a la Borges' Pierre Menard-- your basic psychedelic mindfuck.\n\nSo I wondered about my 2004 reaction to 28th Day, now reissued with almost three times as many songs as the original boasted. I loved their Russ Tolman-produced EP when it came out on Enigma in 1985-- it was the record to put on when you were suffering a gray bout of R.E.M. or Dream Syndicate oversaturation. The band, based in the dinky California college burg Chico, consisted of a teenage Barbara Manning, her boyfriend Cole Marquis, and inanely coifed drummer Mike Cloward, none of whom (with the exception of Babs on a rare release or two) have wowed me much with their output in the two decades since. Marquis, in particular, has seemed a lost cause-- his Downsiders most often remind me of The Hooters or The Call.\n\nSo what went wrong? For their youth, both Manning and Marquis tapped into a timeless source of guitar/bass/drums rock, and even by wizened/jaded 2004 standards, this stuff still sounds as beautiful and rich and satisfying as it ever did. Anthems of heartbreak, odes to inarticulatable sadness, paeans to the dead! Sandy Denny could have sung most of these tunes without breaking a Brit-folk sweat. \"25 Pills\" and \"Pages Turn\" have to be a couple of the stokedest West Coast jangle-pop songs ever written. And not enough praise can be given to \"Lost\", in which Barbara's perfect backing-vox lift Cole's preternaturally world-weary chorus to West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band heights of poesy. And \"Holiday\"! And that tripped-out live cover of George Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\"! Why doesn't Barbara write songs like this anymore? It's flawless: verse/chorus/verse, an unrepentant fansong to all the bands she's ever loved, yet simultaneously totally unique and itself.\n\nIndeed, this is what it sounds like to be young, gifted and white-- or at least, how it sounded in 1985. From the sound of it, 28th Day were intent on being the proverbial Best Band in the World, writing and playing from the collegiate perspective that says desire and true grit are all you need. How American-- how naive to all the squalor and decrepitude down the line-- except that, for a split second, as this CD testifies, they really were the best band in the world.", "title": "28th Day - Lost (28th Day, 1985)", "publishedDate": "2012-02-27T10:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VeXSwZWV5g", "description": "YELLOW BRICK ROAD Promo at the Beginning of Concert I filmed this Footage at RAILHEAD Boulder Station Las Vegas Mar 2014 Copyright Ron Fauth Rockography All Rights Reserved REF Entertainment Marketing", "title": "YELLOW BRICK ROAD Promo at beginning of Concert at RAILHEAD Las Vegas I ROXX AMERICA", "publishedDate": "2014-03-22T08:59:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VedrSn-UXE", "description": "Ahead of the MLS Cup Playoffs, presented by AT&T, Western conference semifinal between FC Dallas and the Seattle Sounders, MLSsoccer.com's Katie Witham brings you \"6 Things You Need to Know.\"\n\nWhich team will win this match?

While not included in the core definition of ADHD, a significant number of children and adults who have ADHD have difficulty regulating their emotions. \n\nTo further complicate matters, there is a significant amount of comorbidity--or, two separate disorders existing together in the same person--between ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. Around 80-90 percent of children with bipolar disorder also have ADHD. Among young people with ADHD, as many as 10-15 percent also have bipolar disorder. (ADHD is the far more common of the two: Around 4-8 percent of people have ADHD, while only around 1 percent have bipolar disorder.) \n\nHere, in an interview conducted following his Grand Rounds presentation at the NYU Child Study Center on June 22, 2012, Steve V. Faraone, PhD, discusses the link between executive functions and emotionality in ADHD. Executive functions control the brain's ability to plan, organize, rein in impulses and generally get things done. Dr. Faraone discusses the connection between deficits in executive functions, and the emotionality associated with ADHD, in which people have a hard time keeping emotional responses in check. Just as with issues with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, those with ADHD may have trouble controlling behavior. \n\nDr. Faraone is the director of child and adolescent psychiatry research, and the director of medical genetics research, as well as professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience and physiology at SUNY Upstate Medical University. \n\nHis Grand Rounds presentation at the NYU Langone Child Study Center was entitled \"Irritable ADHD: Deficient Emotional Self Regulation or Mania?\" Find out more about the NYU Child Study Center and our Grand Rounds series at www.aboutourkids.org.", "title": "Executive Functions and Emotionality in ADHD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-25T16:28:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VerzLj3ikg", "description": "este es el toque de bandera con la letra...", "title": "toque de bandera mexicano", "publishedDate": "2009-06-15T15:09:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Vewp_WLYqQ", "description": "Preview of Kcgunther's blog at TravelPod.

So this is my crack at that. The first half is supposed to conjure images of Gilead and Roland as a younger man, and then the second part, which is a more traditional Ennio Morricone sounding bit, is supposed to bring up the fight in Tull and the trek across the desert.

Actual cockpit transmission from the D-9 bulldozer driver to the watch tower, saying he \"hit an object\" and \"I think the object got hit by the dobby (D-9) and he is in a severe condition.\" He is asked \"Did you see him?\" and responds \"Yes I saw him, I think he is dead.\"\n\nRachel Aliene Corrie (April 10, 1979 -- March 16, 2003) was an American member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM). She was killed in the Gaza Strip by an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer when she was standing or kneeling in front of a local Palestinian's home, thus acting as a human shield, attempting to prevent the IDF from demolishing the home. The IDF stated that the death was due to the restricted angle of view of the IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer driver, while members of the International Solidarity Movement said \"there was nothing to obscure the driver's view.\" A student at The Evergreen State College, she had taken a year off to travel to the Gaza Strip during the Second Intifada.\n\nMORE HERE:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie", "title": "\"Never again, unless we are doing it.\" Rachel Corrie- REAL Footage of death.", "publishedDate": "2012-08-29T18:38:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VrUsxr6Dkk", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "We be fooling", "publishedDate": "2012-06-22T16:01:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VsNlr7LQNE", "description": "\u2022 Send Replay \u00bb  http://cc-wisp.net/sendreplay\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 videos \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u25a0 Dota - TOP PLAYS ?? \u25ba  http://goo.gl/SczP7z\n\u25a0 Dota - TRICKS \u25ba  http://goo.gl/TzvfnX\n\u25a0 Dota - FUNNY MOMENTS \u25ba http://goo.gl/PEdZO5\n\u25a0 Dota - WHY TO PICK \u25ba http://goo.gl/xohJeZ\n\u25a0 Dota - ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY \u25ba http://goo.gl/eUVb3g\n\u25a0 Dota - TOP PLAYS 2013 \u25ba http://goo.gl/JCcu3O\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u25d8 Subscribe \u00bb http://goo.gl/R5TvBr\n\u25d8 Facebook \u00bb https://facebook.com/cwisp\n\u25d8 Vk \u00bb https://vk.com/ccwisp\n\u25d8 Twitter \u00bb https://twitter.com/ccwisp\n\n\u266bDavid Bulla - Highlife", "title": "DotA Tricks #17 - Wisp the Healer", "publishedDate": "2014-05-22T10:18:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VsPnzfRCJs", "description": "Giddy Up Rides Electric Animal Rides-- BIGI Coin acceptor bypass\n\nBIGI COIN ACCEPTOR BYPASS / override switch, sensitivity dial\n\nGIDDY UP RIDES USA\nTech support support@giddyuprides.com\nWebsite: www.giddyuprides.com\nTel: 888-800-3133 x2", "title": "BIGI COIN ACCEPTOR BYPASS", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T23:29:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VsQRHu2noQ", "description": "Appalachian Festival 2008 Cincinnati Ohio Bluegrass.  kentucky sassafras", "title": "Appalachian Festival  2008 Bluegrass Cincinnati - Kentucky Sassafras", "publishedDate": "2008-05-11T02:07:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "9VsUbInC-Uw", "description": "aaDRL Parametric Urbanism III New York, Hudson Yards Proposal Urban Reef_by shampoo.

She received credit for eight months already served in the Macomb County Jail.\n\nLester in May did not show up for her sentencing by Judge David Viviano of Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens. She was supposed to be residing with her grandmother in Warren, under bond restrictions. But officials determined she left the home shortly after her April plea and was living in a mobile home in Jackson.\n\nViviano issued a bench warrant. Probation officials attempted mail contact in July, but correspondence was returned as \"undeliverable,\" court records say.\n\nLester was picked up by police in early September, according to an official involved in the case.\n\nShe was sentenced Sept. 25. Viviano dismissed the contempt of court charge related to her May 15 no-show.\n\nLester admitted to molesting the son of a Warren woman who had allowed her to move in last year because she was homeless. The woman in September 2011 left Lester to babysit her son for an afternoon at the woman's home near Eight Mile and Hoover roads. Lester soon after admitted sexually contacting the boy to a third woman. \n\nhttp://www.macombdaily.com/article/20121016/NEWS01/121019697/warren-woman-gets-16-months-for-fondling-boy", "title": "Female Child Molester, Punched By 5-Year-Old Boy's Angry Mom, Sentenced To 16 Months In Jail", "publishedDate": "2011-09-08T02:53:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W4pSiKHnDo", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Dispute vs Just For Fun", "publishedDate": "2013-05-26T03:59:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W58F6Uu6vI", "description": "Jeffrey shaping a round raisin challah", "title": "The Raisin Challah!", "publishedDate": "2012-01-06T01:10:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W59264ZjBg", "description": "Ricardo explique la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 l'\u00e9conome ainsi que celle au couteau pour peler les courges de type Butternut et poivr\u00e9e.", "title": "Peler les courges Butternut et poivr\u00e9e", "publishedDate": "2012-06-04T15:42:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W5SU-TUtF4", "description": "SUPERFAMILY 03.

As two of the feet run alongside the river Seine engineers were worried water would creep in, so they created metal shoe structures which kept the French water at bay. A bit like a pair of welly boots.\n\u00a0\nTo build the main body they shipped in 18,000 different parts that were prefabricated in a factory and they put them together on site at the banks of the Seine using a whopping 2.5 million rivets.\n\u00a0\nConstruction was completed on 31st March 1889 and Gustave Eiffel was the very first person to climb ALL the 1,710 steps!

REASONS WHY POLYSTYRENE FOAM IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH.\n\n1. Toxic chemicals leach out of these products into the food that they contain. These chemicals threaten human health and reproductive systems.\n\n2. These products are made with petroleum, a non-sustainable, heavily polluting and disappearing commodity.\n\n3. The product does not biodegrade. It crumbles into fragments that have no expiration date.\n\n3. A certain percentage of product will be dumped in the environment, persisting on land indefinitely as litter and breaking up into pieces that choke and clog animal digestive systems in waterways.\n\n4. The product takes up more space in landfills than does paper and eventually will re-enter the environment when landfills are breached by water or mechanical forces.\n\n5. Foam recycling is a public relations stunt, promoted by the chemical industries that manufacture it. This is done in highly centralized, distant facilities using complex chemical processes and expends far more energy than is ever saved by recycling the material.\n\nunbelievably, even the airborne molecules of heterocyclic amines, which are formed when you cook the creatine in muscle tissue, are carcinogenic when inhaled.\nfor more on this google heterocyclic amines.\ntis is so interesting from pubmed:\nThe purpose of this report is to summarize data on carcinogenic heterocyclic amines mainly from the aspect of environmental medicine. Since 1977, a new series of heterocyclic amines has been isolated as potent mutagens and they have been shown to be carcinogenic to experimental animals. Among these carcinogens, carcinogenic amino-alpha-carbolines and amino-gamma-carbolines are widely distributed in such components of the environment as airborne particles, rain water, cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust particles and cooked foods. Moreover, most carcinogenic heterocyclic amines are reported to be present in cigarette smoke. These facts suggest that carcinogenic heterocyclic amines are likely to be ubiquitous environmental pollutants. These results also support the hypothesis that carcinogenic heterocyclic amines may be formed through combustion of various materials such as food, grass and petroleum.\n\nThe mutagenic activity and the mass amount of heterocyclic amines responsible for the mutagenic activity have been measured in some cooked foods. Cooked meats are the predominant source of mutagenic activity in the diet with values ranging from 0 to 10,000 revertants per gram reported in the Ames/Salmonella test with strain TA98. Several heterocyclic amines are present and have been quantified using solid-phase extraction followed by HPLC. Frying at higher temperatures and for longer times produces the greatest mutagenic response, and concomitantly, the largest amounts of heterocyclic amines. Most of the mutagenic activity in fried meat samples can be accounted for by MeIQx(2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-b]quinoxaline), DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline) and IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline), although other heterocyclic amines are present and PhIP (2-amino-3-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) mutagenic activity becomes significant at higher temperatures. Non-meat products such as baked breads can also form significant mutagenic activity, particularly when overcooked. Commercially prepared hamburgers made from meat substitutes such as tofu, wheat gluten or tempeh and fried at 210 degrees C have up to 10% of the mutagenic activity of a fried beef patty cooked under the same conditions. When detected, amounts of heterocyclic amines in fried beef patties range from a total of 0.35 ng/g for commercial beef hamburgers to 142 ng/g for a beef patty cooked over a barbecue. Dietary intake is expected to have a large range, from less than one microgram per day to over 50 micrograms per day based on current knowledge of known heterocyclic amine chemicals and heterocyclic amine-containing foods.", "title": "ASO LACC incompetence and carcinogens on campus", "publishedDate": "2010-05-06T10:18:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W9LjpskCUQ", "description": "Samy aljamal (THE SOURCE MMA) 3rd dan describes the proper way of guillotine escape from the guard", "title": "escapes: guillotine from guard", "publishedDate": "2011-09-20T19:45:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W9oxedi3Io", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/DashCamOwnersAustralia -\"Nearly cleaned up 4 people in a commodore to my surprise thank god there was no baby in the baby seat.Tyres on the car where completely bald.\" - Melbourne VIC\n\nThanks to Greg C", "title": "Car spins out and crashes in front of truck - Caught on dash cam", "publishedDate": "2014-11-09T09:27:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "9W9u32f3-5o", "description": "Jamming Tyler Brown's kit in his spotless room.\nTHIS IS NOT MY KIT, I endorse Seven Drumworks, Meinl Cymbals, Vater Sticks, and Evans Drumheads.\n Enjoy your free breadsticks.", "title": "Luke Holland - Free Breadstick Lick", "publishedDate": "2013-05-01T01:17:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WAHYTVtIVU", "description": "BridgeClimb Sydney was nice enough to give us a private bridge climb on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  \n\nBridgeclimb Sydney's links\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bridgeclimbsydney\nhttps://www.twitter.com/bridgeclimb_syd\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/bridgeclimb\nhttps://www.Youtube.com/bridgeclimbsydney\n\nSpecial thanks to Sarah for setting this up.

And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.\n\n 7And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.\n\n 8And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.\n\n 9And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.\n\n 10And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.\n\n 11And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.\n\n 12Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.\n\n 13So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.\n\n 14And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.

Pairs of shoals and reefs were compared, where one shoal was zoned \"green\" (closed to fishing) and the other \"blue\" or \"yellow\" (open to line fishing). The demersal habitats and vertebrate communities were sampled using non-extractive Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). These BRUVS revealed a diverse fauna of fish, sharks, rays and sea snakes, including species prized by fishers, taken as bycatch, or not vulnerable to hook and line fishing.\n\nAt each shoal multiple BRUVS (typically 12) were deployed, each recording 1 hour of underwater video. These videos were then viewed by an expert classifier and the relative abundance and species of fish and other vertebrates (such as seasnakes, turtles, whales and dolphins) seen in each video were measured and recorded. \n\nThe videos shown in this series (162 videos from all 1102 BRUVS) were selected to show the best 30 secs of the best 3 videos (based on the abundance of coral trout and red emperor) from each of the 48 study locations. \n\nThis video was taken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). http://www.aims.gov.au\n \nZone: GREEN (closed to fishing)\nLocation: Barcoo Bank\nCamera depth: 46.3 m,\nDate taken: 02/11/09 11:12,\nBRUVSID: 7408\nOpcode: ARP4BB\nCamera: 2", "title": "Great Barrier Reef fish survey 7408, Green zone, Barcoo Bank, (highlight)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-10T01:42:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WKDcy3JbT8", "description": "Thorough preparation is key to the spontaneity of your conversational speech.

The first member of the A320 family\u2014the A320\u2014was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was first delivered in 1988. As of 31 August 2011, a total of 4,790 Airbus A320 family aircraft have been delivered, of which 4,700 are in active service. In addition, another 3,132 airliners are on firm order. According to Airbus, it ranked as the world's fastest-selling jet airliner family according to records from 2005 to 2007, and as the best-selling single-generation aircraft programme. The family's direct competitors are the Boeing 737, 717 and 757.\nThe Airbus A320 family are narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines.\nThe Airbus A320 family are low-wing cantilever monoplanes with a conventional tail unit with a single vertical stabilizer and rudder. Wing swept back at 25 degrees, optimised for maximum operating Mach number 0.82,[46] built by British Aerospace (BAe). Compared to other airliners of the same class, the A320 features a wider single-aisle cabin of 155.5 inches (3.95 m) outside diameter, compared to 148 inches (3.8 m) of the Boeing 737 and 131.6 inches (3.34 m) of the Boeing 717, and larger overhead bins. In addition, the aircraft has a cargo hold equipped with large doors to assist in expedient loading and unloading of goods.\nThree suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A320 series: CFM International with their CFM56, International Aero Engines, offering the V2500 and Pratt & Whitney whose PW6000 engines are only available for the A318 variant\nThe A320 series has two variants, the A320-100 and A320-200. Only 21 A320-100s were ever produced; these aircraft, the first to be manufactured, were delivered only to Air Inter (later acquired by Air France) and British Airways (as a result of an order from British Caledonian Airways made prior to its acquisition by British Airways). The A320-200 features wingtip fences and increased fuel capacity over the A320-100, resulting in increased range; otherwise differences are minimal. Indian Airlines used their first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogey main gear couldn't manage. Typical range with 150 passengers for the A320-200 is about 3,300 nautical miles (6,150 km). It is powered by two CFMI CFM56-5s or IAE V2500s with thrust ratings between 113 to 120 kN (25,400 to 27,000 lbf). The direct Boeing competitor is the 737--800. The lowest speed an A320 can fly is approximately 207 km/h.\n\nSeating capacity 156 (1-class, maximum)134 (1-class, typical)124 (2-class, typical)\n\nAirbus A320 \n- Alitalia / AirOne\n- Air Berlin \n- Aeroflot\n- Ural Airlines\n- KoralBlue\n- Air Malta", "title": "Airbus A320 At Genova International Airport GOA - LIMJ ( Landing Taxing and Take - Off )", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T22:01:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WLdb897nPw", "description": "Moteur balancier \u00e0 eau fonctionnant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l humidification et l'\u00e9vaporation successive \u00e0 distance, d' une bandelette de papier (ici une assiette en carton d\u00e9coup\u00e9e, le cot\u00e9 lisse \u00e9tant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la tige) proche d'une \u00e9ponge qui trempe dans un bac d'eau, la bandelette se courbe dans un sens puis dans l'autre d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant ainsi son centre de gravit\u00e9 en avant puis en arri\u00e8re cr\u00e9ant ainsi le mouvement ( ici la taille du contenu du bac d'eau permet th\u00e9oriquement un fonctionnement non stop pendant plusieurs semaines) Merci a Simi112 au passage pour ses vid\u00e9os qui sont riches d'id\u00e9es", "title": "Moteur \u00e0 eau Puskas.

Description of historical background of the ancient communities\n\n==Views==\n\nMufti Muhammad Iqbal Kharal, the Khatib of Hazrat Mian Mir Mosque, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had a distinguished status among the contemporary intellectuals and scholars. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri had tried to spread the gnosis of the Holy Qur`an in the world by undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an. He said Shaykh-ul-Islam was such personality who was uniting Umma on a single platform as well as spreading the Quranic teachings in the modern way.\n\nDr Jamil-ur-Rahman Chishti of the Chishtia Abad, Kamoki, said that Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadris translation of the Holy Qur`an enlightens the readers with the real spirit of the Holy Book. The unique and lucid style of translation distinguishes Irfan-ul-Qur`an from the existing body of translations. \n\nCentral Amir of Jamat Ahl Hadith, Pakistan, Allama Zubair Ahmad Zaheer said that Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri did full justice to the demands of translation and rendered the translation beautifully by rising above sectarian affiliations. He congratulated Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri for doing translation of the Holy Qur`an for the entire Muslim Umma and all sects. \n\nRenowned scholar Dr Tahir Hameed Tanoli said that if the translations of the Holy Qur`an done in the subcontinent were the tree, Irfan-ul-Qur`an, the translation of the Holy Quran by Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was its fruit. This translation had the unique quality of an exegesis in terms of its meaningfulness. Shaykh-ul-Islams translation of the Holy Book was a great scholarly feat of the contemporary age from which the Umma would continue to derive benefit for centuries. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has made the reverence for the Holy Prophet (saw) the pivot and no where does the translation go away from this.\n\nKhawaja Muin-ud-Din Koraija of Kot Mitthan said that Irfan-ul-Qur`an would continue to be read till the Day of Judgment. Irfan-ul-Qur`an not only removes the doubts and reservations of the modern mind but also offers remedy for the scourge of sectarianism. Our society is engulfed in terrorism. The Islamic message of peace was the dire need of the hour and Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is known as an ambassador of peace in the entire world. He also declared to hold the inauguration ceremony of Irfan-ul-Qur`an in the annual spiritual celebrations of Kot Mitthan.\n\nPrincipal of Pakistan Law College, Dr Hamayun Ihsan, said in his talk that undertaking the translation of the Holy Qur`an was the most difficult job of the world. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri deserved felicitation that he did a great favour to the Umma by doing simple, lucid and modern translation of the Holy Qur`an, which is also compatible with the contemporary demands. Dr Ihsan said that if the translations of the quality books were undertaken, it would go a long way in guiding people through a maze of problems. The Umma could regain its lost glory by reading Irfan-ul-Qur`an, for such is its scholarly depth.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith Muhammad Mi`raj-ul-Islam said that there were a few translation of the Holy Qur`an, which did not contain the element of reverence and respect. Irfan-ul-Qur`an is such a valuable treasure as removes all doubts and enhances respect for the holy personages.\n\nShaykh-ul-Hadith of Jamea Nizamia, Lahore Maulana Abdut Tawab Siddique said in his speech that there was dire need of reviving our relationship with the holy Quran. This endeavour of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri really deserves appreciation. His Quranic translation \"Irfan-ul-Quran\" is a became of light for all Muslims.\n\nArab scholars, ash-Shaykh Dr al-Farfur, ash-Shaykh Dr Sayyid Mahmud Abu al-Huda al-Husaini and ash-Shaykh As`ad Muhammad Sa`id as-Sagharji also addressed at the ceremony at the occasion. They said that they could not fully benefit from Irfan-ul-Qur`an because of their ignorance of the Urdu language, which they branded as great deprivation.", "title": "Irfan ul Quran, Sura Al-Ikhlas (112) by Shaykh ul Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir ul Qadri", "publishedDate": "2011-08-07T11:33:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WV1-AklbEQ", "description": "sNax with a huge ninja move against the Ninjas in Pyjamas!\n\nGet 25% OFF CS:GO and other game servers at Astral Game Servers with our coupon: \"25TDV\"\nhttp://billing.astralgameservers.com/aff.php?aff=398\n\nKeep in touch: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheDemoVault , \nhttp://www.twitter.com/TheDemoVault , \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheDemoVault\n\nMatch: NiP vs. Virtus.Pro\nLeague: EMS One Katowice Finals\nmap: de_mirage\nsNax facebook: https://www.facebook.com/snaxfz\n\nESLTV - Commentary:\nstream: http://www.twitch.tv/esltv_cs\nfacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ESLTV\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/ESLTV\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/ESLTV\n\nCasters: \nStuart \"TosspoT\" Saw - https://twitter.com/TheStupot\nNathan \"NBK\" Schmitt - https://twitter.com/Titan_NBK\n\nMatchlink:\nhttp://www.hltv.org/match/2290762-nip-virtuspro-ems-one-katowice-2014\n\nVOD: \nhttp://www.twitch.tv/esltv_cs/b/511596743\n\nDEMO + Commentary:\nhttp://www.file-upload.net/download-8720294/EMS_sNax_vs_NiP-3k_sneaky-_mirage.rar.html\n\n//RECOMMENDATIONS:\nSteelSeries QCK mousepad CSGO edition: http://amzn.to/15I7eNi\nAKG K619 Headphones: http://amzn.to/15Mhq9z\nRazer Deathadder 2013: http://amzn.to/15MfBJK\nROCCAT Taito mousepad: http://amzn.to/1cZlB10\n\nbest regards,\nTheDemoVault", "title": "EMS One Katowice: sNax 'sneaky beaky like' vs. NiP", "publishedDate": "2014-03-16T13:33:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WVgaZXB0iU", "description": "This is an easy route to take in order to reach the final area of the raid.

His songs sounds like they were all composed on a mad acid binge, whilst his attention to detail and multi-genre masterdom begs the question -- why is this guy unsigned?\" -- Kat Jackman, Huffington Post\n\n\"Sex music for metallers\" -- Peanut Baines, Kaiser Chiefs\n\n\"The ever impossible to pigeon-hole Fjokra with the musical masterpiece that is Slyrex.\" -- Peter Donaldson, Absolute Radio\n\n\"Todd Rundgren in Genesis listening to Muse while hanging out with Queen, Sikth and Quincy Jones who are all shagging Prince in Rush's private studio on LSD dressed up as The Beatles mixing Psycore jamming with The Manhattan Transfer in a lost Gershwin musical somewhere in Iceland\"- Dave Wibberley\n\n\"Review of 'The Old Time Nook' -- A psychophrenic trippy aural adventure with 'jazz hands'! Intelligent. Creative. Blending musical styles in a unique way....the band are not just gifted they have mastered their craft. Intrigued to see a live performance!\" -- Vicki Blight, Absolute Radio\n\nAn upbeat hook opens the track leading into Fjokra's intriguing lead vocals. The chorus is enticing and infectious and will definitely get stuck in your head. We for one cannot wait to hear more. -- review of Infinite Loops by Tony D at whisperinandhollerin.com\n\nA mental mash up of dance, rock, electro, funk and pop, this track is something truly distinct and has something for everybody. -- Urban Fairy review of Infinite Loops inBuzzjack.com\n\nThe new single from Fjokra -- Infinite Loops is... different. Think singer-songwriter, mixed with folk, a sprinkling of punky riffs cloaked by a sparkly electro vibe with an incredibly indie-esque chorus. 7.5/10 -- reallyshortreviews\n\nWith a completely eclectic feel, this track has combined various styles to produce something that is truly diverse. 'Infinite Loops' is a great upbeat, rocky dance track, guaranteed to have the listener moving! -- Susie and Chanel, poploving tarts\n\n'We are very interested to see more from this innovative man.' -- simplyvideos.com\n\nGlitter or litter? GLITTER\n\nGlitter all the way, such an eclectic song that draws on many genres to create something new...AND IT WORKS!\n\nInnovative creativity that makes for a well rounded track that pushes the boundaries of music. -- chasethistune\n\nwww.fjokra.com\nwww.facebook.com/fjokraofficial\nwww.twitter.com/fjokra\n\nManagement: Scott Taylor \nContact: scott@fjokra.com", "title": "Fjokra - The Old Time Nook", "publishedDate": "2012-10-03T20:09:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WkMUmX1AeY", "description": "\"The full spectrum creation frequencies broadcast through a multitude of reactivated units of human circuitry will subvert\ncorrupt archetypal references and facilitate the redefintion of God in the human psyque...\"", "title": "a system to help heal our humanity, through self-education - Purpose On Earth", "publishedDate": "2013-03-20T17:48:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WkPw2iP9NY", "description": "Lean how to cook greens for a macrobiotic meal in this free online video on how to prepare healthy macrobiotic food recipes.\n\nExpert: Gayle Stolove\nContact: www.whollymacrobiotics.com\nBio: Gayle Stolove has been professionally involved in both health care, and  the natural foods industry, since approximately 1975.\nFilmmaker: Paul Muller", "title": "Recipes for a Macrobiotic Diet : Cooking Greens for a Macrobiotic Meal", "publishedDate": "2008-10-25T15:19:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WkiHhUambA", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/2idolshow\nhttp://www.facebook.com/2idolshow\n\n2!

This video will show you isometric or setting exercises that will help strengthen your muscles before you are quite ready for big movement exercises.\n\nThe first exercises are quad sets. Sit in long sitting with your legs straight out in front of you. If you want, put a rolled towel underneath your knee to give yourself a target. Then squeeze your knee down into the roll towards the ground. Hold it for 3 seconds, and do ten of them. Next is a hamstring set. Bend up your knees in a hooklying position. Push your heel down into the ground and hold it for 3 seconds, do this 10 times.\n\nThe next two are hip adductor and abductor isometric exercises. First take a belt and wrap it around your thighs just above your knees. Push outwards toward the belt like your legs are opening up like a clamshell. Hold for 3 seconds, and repeat 10 times. Then take a ball or pillow folded in half, and put it between your knees. Squeeze into the ball and hold for 3 seconds, repeat 10 times.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and any related comments are not medical advice.

This is the most incredible catch I have ever seen. Bevan Small catches the ball in the air while crossing over the boundary rope, before hitting the ground he throws the ball to Michael Mason who takes the catch. More info below.\n\nOk, for those who actually read the full description, here are a few things that people seem to be commenting on.\n1. The Northern Districts team wear pink in support of the Breast Cancer Foundation.\n2. When Mason & Small high five, it's NOT 6 runs. The catch has already been completed and the ball is now dead.....look up the rules on catching.\n3. Sorry all you Sri Lanka fans, this is better than the Angelo Mathews catch, as in this one the catcher has to leap, catch the ball and throw before hitting the ground. In Angelo's catch, he caught the ball, took a couple of steps then threw just as he was crossing over the boundary.\n4. For those who don't know the game of cricket and want to know why the 1st guy didn't just take the catch. In cricket, if during the act of catching the ball you make contact with the boundary rope or the ground on the other side of the boundary and the ball is still in contact with you, it is deemed the ball has gone over, which is 6 runs and can't be given out. By throwing the ball back in field before hitting the ground, the fielder has saved 6 runs. As the ball was then caught without having touched the ground or a fielder touching the ground on the other side of the boundary, the catch is legal and is therefore given out.", "title": "Cricket, Incredible catch assist on boundary.", "publishedDate": "2012-01-06T19:43:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WqDpi-SQlw", "description": "", "title": "Transport in plants", "publishedDate": "2013-10-01T23:57:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9WqFdYrhpA8", "description": "QUERIDO DIRETOR FEZ UM TRABALHO LINDO NO ESPETACULO.

I usually trim my beard once every 2-3 months.\n\nQ: How do you wash/take care of your hair?\nA: I honestly don't do anything special... I just try to shampoo (with an ordinary shampoo) and comb it as often as possible. My advise is simply try to keep your hair clean and healthy.\n*NOTE: I used to shampoo my hair every day but my scalp got really dry. So I did some research and it turns out that you should shampoo every other day or even once every 3-4 days, depending on how oily your hair is.\n\nQ: What did you do/What should I do for the middle part of growing?\nA: Hats! ..and patience.\n\nQ: Are you still growing your hair?\nA: Yes! And I'm not planning on stopping any time soon.\n\nQ: Why does the background keep changing?\nA: I'm from Cyprus, but I study in the UK. The room with the Evanescence door is my bedroom in Cyprus and the one with the Fight Club poster is my room in England.\n\nQ: What software did you use to make the video?\nA: I used Adobe Premiere Pro, but I think that you would be able to have the same results with a more basic and easy-to-use software.\n\nQ: Are you Jesus?\nA: Yes.\n\nGENERAL NOTE: I am not a hair expert (or whatever they are called). I'm simply telling you what I did to grow my hair! These tips might not work for you.\n\n=== Thank you for your interest! ===\n\n\nWatch the \"One Year Time Lapse\" here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aERsxXHUNaw", "title": "Two Years Time Lapse (hair growth)", "publishedDate": "2013-06-12T01:31:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "9Wz9o0pRghA", "description": "Visit us at http://veracityopportunity.com.au/", "title": "John Hall - Veracity Associates", "publishedDate": "2014-08-09T05:41:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "9X-9191ZY-k", "description": "", "title": "video Velikie Geevci 1 S1 2 2012 04 22", "publishedDate": "2012-04-26T17:46:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "9X-Z2MbX6jI", "description": "14 giugno 2014 - 50\u00b0 edizione del Rally Valli Ossolane\nPS1 - Fomarco - Camera-car Canella - Gria", "title": "RVO 2014:PS1 Camera-car Canella-Gria", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T09:48:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "9X-_QO05SnI", "description": "Friend lashing frined's sunburnt back", "title": "20 Lashings - 1 (sunburn)", "publishedDate": "2007-12-09T16:05:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "9X-_bp8uAqs", "description": "http://www.datpiff.com/Buczer-Buczer-Boss-mixtape.448002.html\n\nZapraszamy do sprawdzenie kolejnego mixtape'u Buczera,\nzatytu\u0142owanego BOSS,  Buczer docenia i szanuje swoich fan\u00f3w i jako\ndow\u00f3d tego dedykuje im ten mixtape, kt\u00f3ry jest dla nich do pobrania\nca\u0142kowicie za darmo z jednego z najwi\u0119kszych ameryka\u0144skich\nportali z mixtape'ami -- datpiff.com.\nSubskrybujcie kana\u0142 YouTube BuczerTV, b\u0105d\u017acie na bie\u017c\u0105co z produkcjami !\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/buczer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/djselitrn?ref=ts&fref=ts\n\n\nMiks & Master Dondi", "title": "Buczer-P.K.U. by Dj Seli-MIXTAPE BOSS", "publishedDate": "2013-01-29T14:14:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "9X-nSYVfYW0", "description": "This is a newer version of the A++ Heart Transplant.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors.

Epic will showcase the most recent upgrades to the Unreal Engine in a private theater within its expo suite, ES 144, located in the West Hall.\n\nUnreal Lightmass, a new global illumination solver, will be shown for the first time at GDC. Unreal Lightmass produces high-quality static lighting with next-generation effects, such as: soft shadows with accurate penumbrae; diffuse and specular interreflection; and color bleeding. Furthermore, Epic's new Swarm distributed computing framework enables lighting to be generated up to 10 times faster. The new lighting features are bundled with Unreal Engine 3 and benefit all current and future engine licensees. Like all of Epics engine features, Unreal Lightmass is available at no additional cost to licensees.\n\nA new content browser and search engine, powered by a back-end database, enables designers to find game assets near-instantly among large amounts of source content. With thumbnail previews, support for content tagging, and asset collection management, the Unreal Content Browser frees artists from the need to manually open files to look for game assets.\n\nWe looked at how easy it was to search the net with Google, and find photos on Flickr, and redesigned Unreal Engine 3's content searching and tagging along those lines, said Tim Sweeney, chief executive officer and technical director of Epic Games. The result was a productivity boon for artists and designers.\n\nTo power the online community features of Gears of War 2, Epic developed a scalable statistics and data management back end. Now available as a general feature of Unreal Engine 3, the Unreal Master Control Program (MCP) is a high-reliability online service architecture supporting announcements, settings management, online population tracking, and data collection for hardware, profile, and game stats. Unreal MCP includes a set of tools for visualizing gameplay, including such features as heat maps displaying regions of player activity within a level.\n\n\"Battle-tested by over 6.8 million hours of online player time, Unreal MCP seriously ups the ante for game engines,\" says Mark Rein, vice president of Epic Games. \"The online infrastructure required for a modern, triple-A game represents man-years of work, and all of this is now included in Unreal Engine 3.\"\n\nIn addition, Epic Games China will share details regarding its integrated, massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) backend solution for Unreal Engine 3.\n\nLicensees of the Unreal Engine can take advantage of free training sessions on topics including game optimization, content and programming tips, rendering, animation, physics and visuals, as well as workflows for the Unreal Editor, level design and tools at GDC.\n\nHours for Epics booth are the same as expo hours: Wednesday, March 25, 10:00 a.m.  6:00 p.m., Thursday, March 26, 10:00 a.m.  6:00 p.m., and Friday, March 27, 10:00 a.m.  3:00 p.m. Demos will run on the half hour each day of the show, and appointments are not required.\n\nThose wishing to individually meet with Epic should email Mark Rein, mark.rein@epicgames.com, and specify three possible meeting times, the number of people planning to attend, and whether those individuals would like to see a technology demonstration, chat with Epic business representatives, speak with Epic technical representatives or see to other matters. Availability may be limited, so please respond early. Those unable to confirm an appointment in advance are invited to drop by, and Epic will do its best to accommodate visitors.", "title": "Unreal Engine 3 (A GDC trailer showing off the latest features)", "publishedDate": "2009-04-02T10:41:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XDpuwk4wOg", "description": "For the first time in over ten years, Tudor watches will be available in the United States.

The whitening was greatly reduced within specimens immersed in ethanol(http://youtu.be/9XNX39sqASw).  After the specimens failed, whitening was greatly reduced implying that the process was at least partially reversible. \n\nThis video is part of ongoing research in Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Davis on Stress-Induced Whitening in Bone Matrix. (https://sites.google.com/site/whiteninginbonematrix/)\n\nBone visually whitens during loading immediately prior to failure.  Bone whitening during early damage is very similar to polymer crazing.  In crazing, microvoids open in the material, absorb energy, increasing toughness\n\nCrazing within bone is a possible toughening mechanism and appears as whitening in many polymers.  Crazing dissipates energy and has been shown in polymers to increase toughness.  Whitening which has previous been observed in bone prior to fracture was observed in the organic matrix of bone without the presence of the mineralized phase.  \n\nMethod:\n- The bone specimens were taken from the medial-distal quadrant of the third metacarpal bone of necropsied thoroughbred race horses.  \n- 2x8x30mm beams were cut using an EXAKT 310 saw (Oklahoma City).  The central 10mm of the beams were demineralized using a solution of formic acid (22.5%) and sodium citrate (100g/L).  \n- Beams were made into dog-bone specimens with a minimum 2x2mm crossection using custom designed jigs and biopsy punch. \n- The specimen was loaded in tension at a constant strain rate to failure. (1mm/s)  using a servohydraulic system (MTS).  Damage, cracking and whitening during mechanical testing was monitored with high speed (1000fps) stereo cameras (Phototron).  \n- Whitening was expressed as a percentage increase in brightness relative to the initial unloaded frame.\n\nThe effect of hydrogen bonding on mechanical properties and crazing was probed by bathing specimens in solutions of differing Hansen's hydrogen bonding energy(\u03b4h):  100% ethanol: \u03b4h=19.4(J/cm3)\u00bd, 0.9% saline: \u03b4h=42.3(J/cm3)\u00bd\n\nAge related changes in relative hydration within bone have been previously observed and may contribute to bone fragility.  This set of experiments increases our understanding of the role of the organic phase in increasing bone toughness, specifically crazing and the importance of hydrogen bonding within the organic phase.", "title": "Video 2: Mechanical Loading(0.1/s) of Demineralized Bone in Ethanol", "publishedDate": "2012-02-02T00:36:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XNhI7tLpss", "description": "Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Bury.\n\nHighlights from Plymouth's Sky Bet League Two match against Bury at Home Park.", "title": "Plymouth Argyle vs Bury - League Two 2013/14", "publishedDate": "2013-12-22T14:46:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "9XNqv6p7YRI", "description": "The ending song of House of Five Leaves.
