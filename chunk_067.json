Two of these species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia.\n\nMembers of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by a herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5--5 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400--600 g); and a large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their powerful premolar and molar teeth to grind up plant food.\n\nRhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market, and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes. The horns are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails. Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn.", "title": "Rhinoceros & Raining", "publishedDate": "2013-03-19T15:38:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BN1a6IVocQ", "description": "http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/gyro_txt.htm\nRotating systems exhibit some behavior that appears strange when we apply our intuition, developed for linear motion.

She saw a small house that looked like it needed to be repainted and a perky looking girl that was standing right in front of the tedious house.\n\n\nThe perky girl had her brunette hair tied up in a messy ponytail and a sundress that made Selena cringe.

As a result, \"traditional\" development patterns with high-density housing, nearby commercial and pedestrian-friendly walkways are virtually impossible to create. The segregation of uses has also led to sprawling development patterns, mediocre buildings, and faceless places.\n\nForm Based Code\n\"A form based code is a zoning code that is designed to regulate development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-based codes create a predictable public realm primarily by controlling physical form, with a lesser focus on land use, through city or county regulations.\" - Form Based Code Institute (FBCI)\n\nFBC's have been described as the \"DNA of livable communities\" -- defining human scale. These codes are community-built and driven. The results are neighborhoods with vibrant business districts and the qualities that neighborhood residents value: a safe, attractive environment that accommodates pedestrians, transit and bicycles as well as cars; a range of housing types and businesses; and great public spaces -- plazas, greens, parks and squares -- that foster a sense of community. Form-Based Codes are developed with an end result in mind. It functions as a template whereby having clear controls on building form.\n\nThe Transect\nThe Form Based Code (FBC) uses a transect, which is a planning tool to define a series of zones that transition from sparse rural to the dense urban core. A major feature of a transect is that it incorporates a variety of residential and commercial spaces into a single neighborhood.\n\nBenefits of FBC's over Traditional Zoning include increased community involvement; better comprehension of the regulations; improved flexibility; the promotion of good urban design; and enlarged community equity.", "title": "Euclidean Zoning and Form Based Code", "publishedDate": "2011-07-10T01:37:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BUCpEtuMDg", "description": "I say rude words.", "title": "Sofa", "publishedDate": "2007-06-07T00:03:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BUbcDuY1_A", "description": "Den langarmigen Kraken (Octopus Macropus) (Polpessa) bekommt man nur nachts zu Gesicht.

My name is Jacqueline Gillam, a True Harmony licensed aesthetician and  Botanical skin care creator.  Todays minute is on Parabens.  On our last minute we discussed what parabens are and why they are dangerous to our bodies.  Today, I will show you how to identify them on product labels.  \n\nThe word paraben identifies a group of chemical preservatives.  So your products will not just say paraben on them.  There will  be  a prefix in front of the word paraben.  \nTake a look at this popular body lotion.  It contains two types of parabens, methyl paraben and  propyl paraben.  These are the two most commonly used forms of paraben.\n\nIt is popular for companies to advertise their products as green or natural.  This body wash in particular is advertised as a natural aromatherapy product.  It does contain natural ingredients, but as you can see it also contains methyl paraben. \n\nThe other types of paraben to watch  for are Butyl paraben and Ethyl paraben.  \n\nSo lets review.  There are four types paraben to look for when reading a product label.  They are methyl paraben, propyl paraben, Butyl Paraben and Ethyl paraben.\n\nThank you for joining me for this Minute on Parabens.  Be aware of what is your skin care products and join me next for more minutes on skin care.  Remember, Healthy skin is Beautiful skin, see you next time!\n\n\nThis True Harmony Minute was written by Jacqueline Gillam, Licensed Aesthetician.

Are you able to offer one to staff and remain within your budget? As a not for profit Group insurance provider, we understand that fellow nonprofits have a defined budget for benefits, while at the same time are trying to attract and retain top talent.\n\nWe're a national not for profit group benefits company that really does care about the lives and families of all its members. We believe everybody should have access to superior group benefits at affordable rates. Our proposals typically generate overall savings of between 10-20% to duplicate the coverage you currently have -- with plan design improvements and rates locked-in for an extended period of time.  After all, all of our benefits go to our members -- not to shareholders.\n\nWe provide group benefit solutions to over 150 not for profit organizations across Canada working to make their communities, the environment, and the world, a better place. In fact, we partner exclusively with not for profits. Since we opened our doors back in 1996, we believed all of our clients deserve access to the best benefits. That belief is still what drives us today.\n\nBeing not for profit means we don't have to charge high commission rates or generate large profit margins. That means we can provide our partners with better service and benefits at a lower cost. Other group benefit providers often offer initial low rates to get your business, only to hike them later to meet profit objectives. At OJTBF, we offer affordable rates that you can count on remaining affordable, year after year.\n\nOur size allows our clients to secure significant discounts and flexibility from our insurance partner that are typically only available to larger organizations. Simply put, as a 150 organization buying group, we provide large group pricing and service to small and mid-sized organizations.\n\nOur insurance provider (Canada's 5th largest insurer) pays Health and Dental claims for OJTBF clients up to 50% faster than our competition, using a team of dedicated adjudicators exclusively assigned to our block of business. This means our client's claims get processed quickly and accurately!\n\nTo obtain a no cost, no obligation quotation, please contact Robert Miller, our Director of Sales and Marketing at robert.miller@ojtbf.ca, or by phone at (416) 443-9223 x. 128.

And the SNL skit featuring Jim Carrey as the kid from Sia Chandelier perfectly encapsulates that awkwardness. He dances in a nude leotard with a blonde wig. Channeling the young girl from Sia\u2019s epic music video. But it turns out Kate McKinnon wore the same outfit to the office party. And there is only ONE WAY to solve this: a good ol fashioned dance off\n\nThey literally fly into the audience. Carrey finds a mattress and begins performing Lamas. Meanwhile they meet in an epic ending, grasping each other in a romantic embrace. Even Iggy Azalea got in on the action.\n\nIt turns out Joanne, the marble/meatball, won the competition. But who do you think won the office costume party? Carrey or McKinnon? My bet is on Carrey (not because I\u2019m Canadian or anything).\n\nFollow me on Twitter @jldmorris", "title": "Jim Carrey SNL 2014 Sia Chandelier Dance Off with Iggy Azalea and Kate McKinnon REVIEW", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T17:44:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "3BwWT8YewnI", "description": "I tutorial di Valentina Ricci a Dimmi Quando, su Deejay TV.\nLa Vale sar\u00e0 con noi ogni giorno in qualit\u00e0 di esperta di tutorial fai da te.

We can always edit it down!)\n \nDirector, Dakoda Jones, and Florida's Stained Ashes got together to bring you a mind boggling and slightly terrifying music video for their new single \"Something Beautiful\" from their new album As Fear Consumes You out now on and available everywhere! \n\nThis video will give you a taste of their alternative metal sound from their dark and beautiful album, that they recorded with producer, Drew Ray. \n\nColorist, Micah Jones, made the look of the video work so well with the cinematography and editing by, Dakoda jones. And their song flows so well with the video, it's bound to be stuck in your head like any catchy tune on the radio.\n\nBig thanks to BlankTV for their help and support.\n \nBand Bio: From small beginnings in Vocalist Brandon Turner's Living room, to half witted jam sessions in the Rad Shak, to being ousted in the local scene, to packing the venues and bringing an amazing show. Stained Ashes has come miles and leagues since its origin as Brandon's solo project back in 2010. Stained Ashes has been playing together with their current line up since February of 2011, and the addition of Robby in April of 2012. Stained Ashes first released \"Keep Your Number Close\" back in April of 2011 as Brandon's solo project, in October of the same year the \"Funeral In Fire\" EP was released featuring Brandon Turner, Joey Dominick, Kenneth Ittig, and Charlie Howell. The newest work from Stained Ashes is the album \"As Fear Consumes You\", full of heartful choruses, ripping verses, and incredible production. Keep an eye out for some shows near you!\n\nlyrics:  \n\nHe's at my window with a head like a crow\nHe's in my bedroom, I think its something you should know\nHe's in my head with me penetrating all my dreams\nI think he's deadly, and every night he tells me\n\nBring me something beautiful\nBring me something sweet\nBring me someone innocent\nSomething I can eat\n\nCome home with me, you'll be just fine\nIll hold your hand, cold under mine\nIll be ok if you're with me\nOur heart runs fast, ill be your last\n\nThing you heard, you see\nI can't let him rip through me\nBringing you to end your life\nThe only way that ill survive\nSo if you love me\nYou'll have to trust me\nI think he's deadly\nAnd every night he tells me\n\n(Whispered part)\nI won't let you touch her\nAll the courage you can muster\nTake my life, let her survive\nIll just make you suffer\n  \nBand Links:\n \nWebsite:http://www.stainedashes.com/index.html\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/stainedashes\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/stainedashes\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/StainedAshes\nMyspace:http://www.myspace.com/stainedashesofficial\nLastFM: http://www.last.fm/music/Stained+Ashes\nSoundCloud: http://soundcloud.com/stained-ashes\nReverbNation: http://www.reverbnation.com/stainedashes\nPureVolume: http://www.purevolume.com/StainedAshes\n_______________________________\n\nCheck out the BlankTV official website:\nhttp://www.BlankTV.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/BlankTV\nhttp://twitter.com/BlankTVSmitty\nhttp://twitter.com/BlankTVToby\n\nLike us on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/BlankTV\n\nThumbs Up Comment and Subscribe!!

In 23-year-old Amber White's case, the drug should hopefully speed up her labor. White was in the early stages of labor when we came to interview her at LDS Hospital. Her water broke 5 hours ago but baby was certainly taking his time. I didn't even have my bags packed because we are a little early, so we did that and came here.Doctors decided to use Pitocin to speed up Amber's labor. The drug is commonly used on pregnant women. Dr. Hannele Laine is an Obstetrician at the Avenues Women's Center. She says, like any drug, Pitocin has risks. The negative thing we think about most commonly is having too many contractions. Obviously if it can cause induce contractions it can cause too many. And it can occasionally cause abnormal fetal heart rate.The risks are small and doctors and nurses monitor the mom and baby very closely. Amber says she trusts her doctors. They had told me everything and I asked about side effects. We had more than one nurse sit down with us and talked to us about the Pitocin and what it does to the body and basically it is just a natural hormone.For more information about LDS Hospital, visit: http://intermountainhealthcare.org/hospitals/LDSFor more information about the Avenues Womens Center, visit: http://avenueswomenscenter.comFor more information about the Baby Your Baby program, visit: www.babyyourbaby.org.

The third participants are the microbes (nitrifying bacteria) and composting red worms that thrive in the growing media.

New works from Kentridge's ongoing series Universal Archive, including Cat Assemblage (2012) and 12 Coffee Pots (2012), will be shown in Britain for the first time.  With a stress on experimental and serial works, this exhibition will highlight Kentridge's distinctive use of light and shadow and silhouettes, his concern with memory and perspective, and his absorption in literary texts.\n\nHighlights of the exhibition include Art in a State of Hope and Art in a State of Siege (both 1988), early silkscreens which mark Kentridge's transition from designing posters for political protests and theatre productions into fine art printmaking; Living Language (1999), a series of experimental drypoint prints on vinyl LPs; Telephone Lady and Walking Man (both 2000), two surreal life-sized figures in linocut; Portage (2000), an accordion-folded book spanning 4 metres, with silhouetted figures collaged onto pages of the French encyclopedia Le Nouveau Larousse Illustr\u00e9; Nose (2007-2010), a series of thirty small--scale prints inspired by the Russian novelist Nikolai Gogol's story 'The Nose'.\n\nAcclaimed for his animated films, drawings, theatre and opera productions, Kentridge started his career studying etching at the Johannesburg Art Foundation, and printmaking has remained central to his practice ever since. In the past two and a half decades he has produced more than 400 prints, including etchings, engravings, aquatints, silkscreens, linocuts and lithographs; often experimenting with challenging formats and a combination of techniques. \n\nBryan Biggs, Artistic Director at the Bluecoat, said: 'We are delighted to be the fist venue to host this important exhibition by one of the world's leading artists, for whom drawing is at the heart of his art practice and pushing the possibilities of printmaking is a continuing concern.  The exhibition also connects to the Bluecoat's own printmaking studios, where there will be activities alongside a programme of talks'. This events programme is listed below.\n\nFor further PRESS information please contact Phil Bridges, Communications Officer on 0151 702 7769. philip.b@thebluecoat.org.uk. \n\nListings Information.\n\nWilliam Kentridge as Printmaker exhibition events:\n\nEvents Programme (all events free)\n\nSat 8 December 2pm\n\nExhibition tour\n\nThe Bluecoat's Exhibitions Curator, Sara-Jayne Parsons, and Print Studio Manager, Emma Gregory, discuss Kentridge's work from an art historical perspective and discuss the extraordinary range of print processes he and his master printers employ.\n\nSat 19 January 2pm\n\nExhibition tour\n\nAlan Jones, an artist based at the Bluecoat, and our Artistic Director, Bryan Biggs, discuss Kentridge's work in the gallery.\n\nThu 24 January 6pm\n\nKentridge in Context: an evening with Derek Attridge\n\nDerek Attridge discusses Kentridge's work in relation to contemporary South African literature.

I'm happy with how it turned out but it sure was a Marathon getting it finished.\n\nIt's meant to come as close to the Vendel 7 helmet from around 600 AD as possible within the SCA Heavy combat ruleset and with all parts durable enough for full contact stick fighting.\n\nThe base is a steel helmet made from two halves riveted together by a central band and an occular (eyeglasses) with an intergrated nose guard, after archeological drawings of the under-helmets in the Vendel and Valsg\u00e4rde finds. \nThe bar over the Eyes are a society safety regulation feature I had to incorporate. I did try to make it as unintrusive to the apperarance as possible, blackening it and shaping it to conform to the Eye hole shape.\n\nI've fitted it perfectly to the shape of my head with minimal padding and under the maille is a hidden lower helmet half due to SCA safety regulations. \n\nIt weighs about 6.2 kg so it's pretty Heavy for an SCA helmet but still fully useabl, visibility is excellent and breathing is decent cosnidering maille covers the mouth. \nNow I only have to exercise more to get my old endurance back. I've already used it in the Visby tournament and got to the final using it so it works for chivalric sports combat.\n \nThe 250 hgours were used to make it fit perfectly and to get the rigth shape and the most accurate look out of the parts. However much of what is visible are bought, though as half-fabricated parts.\n\nThe helm top\nIt's made from a modified helmet top from www.ironmongerarmoury.com, though it was more of a Norman pointly top to begin with that I cut in half and re-shaped to be round topped. It was a very nice norman top though and I have another I bought at the same time that may make a nice St Wenclass helmet from sometime. \nThe top os 2.5 mm thick high quality steel. The original probably was half that in thickness but 2.5 makes for a sturdy Full Contact helmet that'll last a long time.\n\nThe bronzes\nThe most excellent plates and other bronze fittings are from Raymond the Quiet www.quietpress.com. Tese come cast flat so I domed them with a soft mallet and a bowl in the top of a tree stump, Then I cut pieces to fit the top as closely to the original as possible. \nThe originals have alattice of bronze bands holding pressblech foil Squares in Place, that would never stand up to SCA combat so Raymond makes these as solid cast parts with a cast fake band framing them. I cut the ones I had to and made the most of using the fake bands whenever I could. The post fitting blackneing helps hide some of this. \n\nThe maille\nThe maille drape (aka Aventail on later age helmets) is made from 20x20 cm squares of Roman maille I bought from www.getdressedforbattle.co.uk. It's the closest one gets to the original maille on the helmet with mass produced maille today, including every other ring being solid punched rings and the others being round section round riveted maille. Inner dimension is about 5 mm, outer is about 8 mm so it's a rather fine maille but very tough. I measured, cut and riveted together the drape from 5 20x20 pieces and attached it to the helm with the same method used on the original. This uses a folded over perforated edge with an iron wire drawn through it.", "title": "Vendel style SCA helmet", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T13:52:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "3CO9rMbZuKo", "description": "Sika CarboDur\u00ae is a carbon fiber reinforced polymer used to allow concrete, beams and floors to carry much higher loads.

This documentary asks whether birds could have been descended from dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2002, scientists were astonished by the discovery of a beautiful and bizarre fossil in a Chinese stone quarry. With four wings and superbly preserved feathers, the creature resembled nothing that palaeontologists had ever seen. Dubbed Microraptor, the crow- sized fossil is one of the smallest dinosaurs ever found and one of the most controversial, challenging conventional theories and assumptions about the evolution of flight. Those who believe in the connection between dinosaurs and birds have generally assumed that flight must have begun from the ground, with fast-running dinosaurs that eventually became airborne as feathered arms evolved into wings. On the other hand, sceptics believe that it would have been physically impossible for running dinosaurs to get off the ground, and that flight evolved from the trees, with small arboreal reptiles gliding from the treetops. This programme attempts to shed some light over the debate, teaming up with experts in palaeontology, aerodynamics and scientific reconstruction to perform tests on a replica of the fossil. Could Microraptor provide the missing link to settle the controversy?", "title": "The Four-Winged Dinosaur | PBS America", "publishedDate": "2014-04-17T11:15:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3CrzY7jb9fQ", "description": "This is a vid about the principles of SDS PAGE.

Although hampered by studio demands following a disastrous test screening in Santa Monica, Jean Renoir's noir demands a second look and a sweeping re-appraisal. Forced to jettison his traditional high ensemble narrative style, Renoir stripped all extraneous elements and characters out of the film, creating a unique mise-en-scene in The Woman on the Beach that seemingly maroons the films protagonists on the wrecks of their desires and guilts. Ostensibly the tale of a triangle that develops between the earthy wife (Joan Bennet) of a blind painter (Charles Bickford) and a recuperating serviceman (Robert Ryan), The Woman on the Beach is akin to Fritz Lang's later noir Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, in that by the end of the film the viewer is forced to re-examine, and question, the narrative he has just witnessed.

This DVD captures Death Vomit's most punishing performance live on camera, and is a must have addition to any true brutal Death Metal enthusiasts collection. With live footage of songs including 'Anthem to Hate', 'GBM' (God Blame Me), and their cover of Slayers 'Criminally Insane', which they perform with unprecedented excellence, Death Vomit are easily recognizable as one of the best performing acts within the metal scene worldwide. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nXenophobic Records, 2011.", "title": "DEATH VOMIT 'Anthem to hate' FLAMES OF HATE DVD", "publishedDate": "2011-04-05T10:47:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D36hrimRk0", "description": "Sua Pan DO4 Models meteorological station dismantle on humid October day 2012.", "title": "Meteorological Station Dismantle", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T10:03:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D3HVLJgbYw", "description": "Let Down is a song of Chester Bennington's solo album. \nThe side project's name is Dead by Sunrise.", "title": "Chester Bennington - Let Down (Live)", "publishedDate": "2007-07-09T23:55:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D3Z8eqFIf0", "description": "Music used:\nSuper Mario 3D World - The Bullet Bill Express\nSuper Mario 3D World - Battle on the Great Tower\nThe Mighty Quest For Epic Loot Soundtrack - BGM 3\nSuper Mario 3D World - Beep Block Skyway\nSuper Mario Galaxy - Song 31\n2001b Castlevania - Game Over\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess OST - Game Over", "title": "Gravel Poot", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T21:04:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D3fxMxclbQ", "description": "Le syndrome de la bandelette est l\u2019irritation de la bandelette ilio-tibiale qui est situ\u00e9e sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieur de la cuisse.

My name is Bill Hyder and I'm the Director for the National University Polytechnic Institute. Located in beautiful San Diego, California, National University Polytechnic Institute offers an exciting opportunity to explore an adventurous career as a commercial diver. \n\nThe Professional Certificate in Marine Technology is a commercial diving program providing our students with the technical diving skills needed for entry into the diving industry as commercial divers. The program is a fast past immersion into surface applied and scuba diving which include air and helium-oxygen elements, diving safety, professional work habits, underwater work skills, and the diving science needed to become a commercial diver. Students will develop the problem solving, team building, and communications skills appropriate to this program. Upon completion of the core training, students will select one of two professional diving concentrations. \n\nThe Diving Medical Technician concentration prepares students in the medical aspects of diving and delivers advanced training in hyperbaric medicine. Dive medics are respected professionals who perform regular work as divers and, when necessary, respond to medical emergencies on the job. Graduating as a diving medical technician will qualify you as working diver as well as a dive medic for underwater jobs inland and offshore. This concentration also qualifies you to take the emergency medical technician (EMT) exam through the National Registry. \n\nThe Non-Destructive Testing concentration prepares students to conduct a number of advanced underwater inspection and testing techniques that are important for ensuring the quality of underwater construction. The program is designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform a variety of inspections to locate and determine the condition of structures, subsea pipelines, and platforms. Students are trained in a variety of nondestructive testing methods to inspect metals, welds and non-metallic materials. Graduate as a non destructive testing technician and you will be trained to American Society for Nondestructive Testing standards in ultrasonic , magnetic particle, dive penetrant, and visual testing and be ready to go to work on inland or offshore projects. Training requires time in the classroom as well as time in the dive tank. With the state-of-the-art classrooms and a 44,000 gallon freshwater dive tank our students receive the best dive training in the world. \n\nWith two classrooms equipped with hyperbaric chambers the dive medic program offered here is second to none. With top of the line non-destructive testing equipment students operate at a high level using cutting edge technology to prepare them for the job market. The commercial diving program at National University Polytechnic Institute offers its students the opportunity to become highly trained in a field that offers an endless supply of excitement and adventure. For more information about our program please contact one of our knowledgeable advisors at extlearning@nu.edu or call us at (800) 432-3483.

I have never seen or been informed of any product that can provide the outstanding benefits you can get with us.\n\nA+ Absorbent is a organic product  that has been specifically engineered and designed by Mr. Eugene Ferweda over the past 25 years.  His focus has been to optimize its cleanup  absorption properties in relation to petroleum spills both on and off water. Wildlife are protected by the fact that A+ encapsulates the oil after absorption, jealously holding the oil within its capillary structure as the petroleum is converted into an organic fertilizer.\n\n ***  We capture and encapsulate the oil upon contact in less than a minute, who else can do that in an environmentally safe manner while protecting wildlife from further oil contact.\n\n  *** We can provide enough organic A+ product to encapsulate about 200,000 gallons of oil per day, rendering the oil captured by A+ harmless to contact.\n\n\nMore and more oil is pouring into the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20th explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling rig, threatening the coastal marshes of Louisiana and Mississippi, other coastlines of the Gulf, and potentially spreading to the Atlantic around Florida's east coast. Destructive cleanup efforts (such as steaming beaches) that were used to clean up oil spills like the Exxon Valdez in Alaska two decades ago need to be replaced with more responsible methods. We can provide the materials for a faster, less harmful method of cleaning up this mess before it spreads out of control.  Florida Gov. Charlie Crist won't be saying \"Drill, baby, drill!\" anymore as he has recognized the economic impact of shoreline drilling gone wrong on Florida tourism. Crist has asked BP to pay for tourism advertisements, but what can your governor, representative, or senator ask of BP? Ask BP to get a faster, less-hazardous solution petroleum remediation (oil spill cleanup.)\n\nCommercial fishermen have been cooperating with the cleanup effort while there is too much contamination for safe fishing, and they could easily distribute A+ Absorbent from their boats, too.\nSee also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_uavAo_Rvg for an A+ ABSORBENT demonstration by Don Shelby of WCCO", "title": "A Plus Absorbent Demonstration", "publishedDate": "2010-05-14T11:17:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D9AeP7fMQY", "description": "Mario Balotelli fight with Adrian / West Ham United 3-1 Liverpool (Premier League, 20.09.2014)\nMusic: Taking a Beating - Ethan Meixsell", "title": "Balotelli vs. Adri\u00e1n (West Ham - Liverpool) | HD", "publishedDate": "2014-09-21T08:54:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D9DhOw-ePU", "description": "Analyzes the effect on demand of a change in the price of complementary goods.", "title": "Change in Price of Complementary Good.m4v", "publishedDate": "2010-02-19T13:28:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "3D9SxcD0Ex4", "description": "Subscribe Now:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Ehow\n\nWatch More:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Ehow\n\nYou can find the square root of a negative value in a very specific way.

ACFN wants no further developments until Shell is brought to justice and our broader concerns about the cumulative impacts in the region are addressed,\" - Chief Adam.\n\nThe Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN) filed suit against Shell Oil Canada in September of 2011. Papers were served to Shell executives in November.\n \nThe Case against Shell arose from Shell not meeting contractual agreements made with ACFN in 2003 and 2006 regarding two open pit mining tar sands projects. Shell had made promises to provide adequate resources for the community to participate in mitigation discussion, to map out traditional areas and study potential impacts of Shell projects on sacred sites, and for the community to implement a community monitoring program.\n \nAfter years of unmet agreements with Shell Oil, the Athabasca Chipewyan people decided to risk everything by challenging Shell's practices and filing suit represented by Othuis Kleer Townshed Firm. The agreements in question were meant to ensure Shell would provide measures to lessen impact of these mines on ACFN, including agreements to address environmental issues and mitigation. Shell's failure to meet these agreements with ACFN has led to harmful impacts on the environment and ACFN's constitutionally protected rights and culture.\n \nIn addition to the lawsuit against Shell, ACFN also plans to oppose all future tar sands projects by Shell. Tar sands have been widely recognized as the most destructive project on earth because of the serious impacts on treaty and aboriginal rights, ecological destruction and global green house gas emissions (GHG). Shell is one of the largest players in the tar sands producing close to 20% of overall production.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species, and have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In 2011, there were more than 924 million live goats around the globe, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Female goats are referred to as \"does\" or \"nannies\", intact males as \"bucks\" or \"billies\", and their offspring are \"kids\". Castrated males are \"wethers\". Goat meat from younger animals is called \"kid\" or cabrito (Spanish), and from older animals is simply known as \"goat\" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas \"mutton\" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).  Etymology The Modern English word goat comes from Old English g\u0101t \"she-goat, goat in general\", which in turn derives from Proto-Germanic *gaitaz (cf. Dutch/Icelandic geit, German Gei\u00df, and Gothic gaits), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *\u01f5\u02b0aidos meaning \"young goat\" (cf. Latin haedus \"kid\"), itself perhaps from a root meaning \"jump\" (assuming that Old Church Slavonic zaj\u0119c\u01d0 \"hare\", Sanskrit jih\u012bte \"he moves\" are related)[citation needed]. To refer to the male, Old English used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century. Nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century and billy goat (for males) in the 19th. History Horn cores from the Neolithic village of Atlit Yam Goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans. The mountain pygmy most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. Neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats for easy access to milk and meat, primarily, as well as for their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair, blow blows and sinew for clothing, building, and tools billy . The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in Ganj Dareh in Iran. buck bucks fight fighting fights Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in Jericho, Choga Mami Djeitun and \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, dating the domestication of goats in pygmy sheeps pygmies Western faint faints fainting mate mates mating Asia at between 8000 and 9000 years ago rabid rabies billy goat goats disease diseases diseased farm farms animal animals chicken chickens hen hens rooster rooster mates mate mating sex male female tips milk milks funniest home video videos fail fails tape tapes camera cameras tip advice farming farmer farmers field fields funny comedy strange odd weird horse horses cattle cow fox wolf wolves hyena hyenas pen pens cage cages caged crazy insane weird odd comedy comedian birth calves calf baby babies puppy puppies feed feeding feeds food Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP as the domestication date. Historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce parchment. Anatomy and health Goats are considered small livestock animals, compared to bigger animals such as cattle, camels and horses, but larger than microlivestock such as poultry, rabbits, cavies, and bees. Each recognized breed of goats has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 300 lbs for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to 45 to 60 lbs for smaller goat does. Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pigmy, which stand 16 to 23 inches at the shoulder as adults Eye with horizontal diet diets pupil Most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. Goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" (meaning, genetically hornless) or the horns have been removed, typically soon after birth.[10] There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. The horns are most typically removed in commercial dairy goat herds, to reduce the injuries to humans and other goats. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality. Goats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum", "title": "Goat making funny sound", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T02:58:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3DoST3wyRKQ", "description": "USP-S | Caiman (Factory New) | Kaiman | Ca\u00efman | Kajman | Timsah | Caim\u00e1n | Caimano\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=USP-S+Caiman&appid=730\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded in 1080p / 1920x1080\nSettings in CS:GO on high.\nCounter-strike: Global Offensive\nCounterstrike\nCS:GO\nCS GO\nCSGO\nWeapon skin\nWeaponskin", "title": "USP-S | Caiman - Skin Showcase", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T13:32:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "3DoWXCTM6CI", "description": "Nadau", "title": "Quin ber\u00f2i dia", "publishedDate": "2010-12-01T20:40:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "3DoWXYgPquA", "description": "", "title": "Mamifero Mustelidae Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818), nutria, The neotropical otter", "publishedDate": "2013-06-06T00:40:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "3DoafY-4edY", "description": "", "title": "NEW SPARTA GYM ( Maddaloni) - CE-", "publishedDate": "2010-04-14T22:02:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3DoarJAf55k", "description": "In this video, you will learn how to remove the silencer from an exhaust.", "title": "Exhaust Silencer Removal", "publishedDate": "2012-02-06T22:11:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Dp5KBdqlhU", "description": "The Chronological Study Bible is the only study Bible that presents the text of the New King James Version in chronological order\u2014the order in which the events actually happened\u2014with notes, articles, and full-color graphics that connect the reader to the history and culture of Bible times and gives the reader a dramatic, \"you are there\" experience.

Hedges says that the Obama administration's monitoring of Associated Press phone records continues a pattern of targeting press freedom that began with WikiLeaks. \"I find all of these measures to essentially shut down the freedom of information -- including the persecution of Julian Assange and Bradley Manning -- as symptomatic of a reconfiguration of our society into a totalitarian security and surveillance state,\" Hedges says. \"One where anyone who challenges the official narrative, who digs out cases of torture, war crimes -- which is of course what Manning and Assange presented to the American public -- is going to be ruthlessly silenced. And I find the passivity on the part of the mainstream press [who used WikiLeaks'] information and turning their backs on Manning and Assange to be very shortsighted for precisely this reason.

Just put an available sign in the actual yard and wait for that phone for you to ring. The problem is, how does one find a GOOD real estate professional? You may start with magazine.\n\nPick up the Saturday and even Sunday paper -- whichever day they have all the North Carolina homes in your region. You may collect a number of real estate guides to look through. Browse the listings to locate properties similar for you to yours. For anyone that is selling a log cabin, you want to take into consideration cabins for sale. If that you are selling a lakefront estate, seek out those people.\n\nWhen you find equivalent properties, note the names and variety of the agents which have been marketing them. The idea here is to find a realtor that has experience with all your style of house. An agent that has the many million dollar homes will not be the best to sell your own portable home, for illustration. You choose agents that contain sold or can certainly sell several properties like yours.\n\nThings to Ask A real estate professional\n\n1. When you call the agents - and you need to call several - you want to verify that they do now have experience selling properties like your office. Ask for examples.\n\n2. Ask what they do to sell a property. Any agent can certainly place an advert and put your own home in the several listings. Do they possess existing leads - people in search of properties like yours? Do they permit other agents understand your property?\n\n3. Accomplish they show their particular listings usually? Many agents just list real estate for sale and let others sell it for the kids. It's more profitable for the kids, but not available for you. As long when they are a excellent salesperson, you desire these phones be going from the house with potential buyers.\n\n5. Do they do their very own closings? Again, it usually is better for these phones delegate this area of the method, but it isn't better for yourself. You want the identical person to become there from the whole practice. You want one person in order to call. Things get it wrong constantly in real estate, so don't confuse it further insurance firms more people concerned.\n\nMost real estate professionals will probably argue these products. That's okay, but bear in mind that you have other things they won't make clear too. For illustration, did you are aware that open houses tend to be primarily a sales tool for real estate professionals? In simple fact, new agents (not the actual listing agent) are sometimes given the job of website hosting service your wide open house, so they can find buyers for you to cooperate with. It isn't expected that they're going to sell your house inside the operation.\n\nAlso understand that whenever you see ads for North Carolina homes, and they will not have prices, it is a prospecting strategy. When that buyer wanting to get a $100, 000 home calls inside your $300, 000 household, the agent is just not gonna make him capable of afford your household. The whole point was for getting him to call which means this individual could promote him ANY house. Meanwhile, other potential buyers for the home skipped in the ad - you can find enough homes WITH prices to see (insist that ads for the possessions have the cost listed).\n\nTrust your pure intuition when choosing a realtor. If you don't feel comfortable with an adviser, it's possible market won't either. And have the suitable queries. You don't want to find a realtor you like. You want to find the right agent for the house.", "title": "Best Real Estate Agent in Greensboro, NC Call Now  336 283-3383", "publishedDate": "2013-05-16T07:55:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "3EEvcQm8oXA", "description": "D\u00e9couvrez la bande-annonce du nouveau film de Jean-Marie et Arnaud Larrieu.\nAvec Mathieu Amalric, Karin Viard, Ma\u00efwenn, Sara Forestier, Denis Podalydes.\nAu cin\u00e9ma le 15 janvier.\n\nRetrouvez-nous sur Facebook:\nwww.facebook.com/amourcrimeparfait\n\nSur Twitter:\n#AmourCrimeParfait", "title": "L'amour est un crime parfait - Bande-annonce officielle", "publishedDate": "2013-11-28T10:05:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3EFAk_JCF5g", "description": "Did Thomas Jefferson really say Christianity was a \"perverted\" system?

The other quotes by Jefferson are accurate but that is utterly beside the point. The real issue is that DAWKINS SCREWED UP, PERIOD.\n\nI might add that \n\n1) Some (not all) of the quotes Bilkerman uses actually support the interpretation of the real reading of the quote that I offer, but none at all support the mangling Dawkins uses.\n\n2) Bilkerman whines about how I allegedly misrepresented his own words, but I did no such thing. While I modified their order so that they could be presented as dialogue within the script, it does accurately present what he said in substance. Dawkins does not do so with his misquote of Jefferson.\n\n3) From the very beginning, the whole point has been that Dawkins screwed up THIS quote. Bilkerman admits this, and therefore is doing nothing but engaging in 10 minute plus distractions by whinging about other quotes or how he thinks Dawkins' misquote somehow really represents Jefferson correctly. It is Bilkerman who is thus engaging a strawman, and ignoring the real point.\n\nNotably, he fails to address how I explain how the two versions of the quote (fake and real) distort Jefferson's intention...and still fails to address the bogus Franklin quote.\n\nHe also can't spell \"Tekton\" correctly.", "title": "Bogus Quote Break 13: Bikerman's Jefferson Bilk", "publishedDate": "2013-07-19T12:58:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "3EFEY-4V2Ak", "description": ".;...-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

I provvedimenti del Riesame.\nEcco il testo : \nLa cupola della \"Nuova Cupola\" subisce le scosse telluriche dei giudici del Tribunale del Riesame. Crepe e danni. Si' perche' l' ondata delle scarcerazioni si manifesta sempre piu' inarrestabile, al pari della raffica di arresti che il 26 giugno scorso ha imperversato in provincia di Agrigento, e non solo, contro la presunta costituzione dell' ottavo mandamento mafioso agrigentino, la \"Nuova Cupola\". Infatti, ieri sono stati scarcerati gli empedoclini Alfonso Tuttolomondo, al braccio dell'avvocato Pennica,  e Giorgio Traina, aggrappato all'avvocato Castronovo. L' ordinanza di custodia cautelare in carcere e' stata annullata per carenza di gravi indizi di colpevolezza. Adesso il Tribunale della Liberta' ha liberato  Francesco Paolo Cioffi, 36 anni, di Agrigento, difeso dagli avvocati  Daniela Posante e Maurizio Salvatore Buggea, e poi  Stefano Mangione, 49 anni, di Raffadali, Filippo Azzarello, 48 anni, di Ventimiglia di Sicilia, in provincia di Palermo, dove si sarebbe trapiantata una colonia mafiosa da Palma di Montechiaro, ed Ettore Allegro, 49 anni, di Caltanissetta. Anche a loro favore i magistrati di scalino superiore al piano del Gip hanno rilevato la non sussistenza della gravita' degli indizi di colpevolezza, tanto da provocare l'emissione della misura carceraria. Gia' il Gip,  il giudice di primo grado, per le indagini preliminari, lo scorso 29 giugno, tre giorni dopo i fermi, che hanno anticipato gli arresti perche' si e' paventato il pericolo di fuga degli indagati, ha assestato i primi colpi di scalpello alla statua dell' impianto accusatorio dell' inchiesta \"Nuova Cupola\". Infatti, il Gip non ha convalidato il fermo e ha ordinato la liberazione dei raffadalesi Rosario Mangione, 26 anni, e Salvino Mangione, 39 anni, di Giovanni Rampello, 25 anni, di Agrigento, di Pasquale Vetro, 54 anni, di Sciacca, e di Vincenzo Cipolla, 50 anni, di San Biagio Platani. Lo stesso Gip concesse i domiciliari a Giuseppe Lo Mascolo, 75 anni, di Siculiana, ricoverato in ospedale subito dopo la cattura, e poi morto il 2 luglio.", "title": "Ruoppolo Teleacras - Scricchiola la \"Nuova Cupola\"", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T09:40:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ER59tDOsmw", "description": "english for IT II", "title": "Video presentation : seismography", "publishedDate": "2013-06-07T21:11:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ERIvaPykNg", "description": "", "title": "The Avett Brothers- Talk On Indolence", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T10:53:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ERPZkS8Le0", "description": "Lambada Rock Cover By: \u00a9Jeffreyboy1993", "title": "Lambada (Rock Cover)", "publishedDate": "2011-06-28T17:14:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ERTNLsBoKY", "description": "In this Dark Souls video I show you how to obtain the Wanderer Armor Set & the Falchion located in Blighttown.\n\nClick Here To Subscribe! \u25ba http://bit.ly/12sY2gg\nFacebook \u25ba http://on.fb.me/15KUhja\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/PaperPlanesSean\nInstagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/paperplaneschannel", "title": "Dark Souls: How to get the Wanderer Armor Set & Falchion", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T14:04:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ES5Tuv6nRg", "description": "At times, it is easy for The Eastern Sea to forget that Austin, Texas is home. And for that reason, their self-titled record (in two parts) plays much like a travelogue, a recollection of distant places that tend to mimic their own, somehow foreign, neighborhoods. \n\nMusically, The Eastern Sea combines swelling post-rock-like percussion, energetic and melodic bass guitar, lofty wurlizter, synthesizer pads, and finger-picked guitar that can either float above the ground or come down like a ton of bricks. \n\nAs a band, The Eastern Sea tends to mimic their own musical aesthetic, sometimes swelling to a massive 11-piece collective featuring string and brass instruments, and sometimes simplifying down to the core players in the group: Tomas Garcia-Olano (Bass/Keys), Zach Duran (Percussion), Kevin Thomas (Trumpet/Percussion), and Matthew Hines (Guitar/Vocals/Keys) are the solid foundation on which the band is built. \n\nThe sound and unique sense of place heard on The Eastern Sea's two-part self-titled release also has much to do with the band's unique recording and music writing process. Having just graduated from St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas as valedictorian of his senior class, singer/guitarist/songwriter Matthew Hines has had to work, along with the other full-time students in the band, to create something special despite an often insane schedule. \n\nAs the band continues to grow on a regional and national level, what 90.5 KUT, Austin's nationally-renowned public radio, has said of the band certainly rings true.", "title": "The Eastern Sea - \"The Snow\": SXSW 2011 Showcasing Artist", "publishedDate": "2011-02-21T22:33:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3ESBD51YdXs", "description": ".\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nNew Ethiopian Music 2013 Video  New Ethiopian Music 2014\nSubscribe to get the Newest Ethiopian and Eritrean Music Videos\n.\n.\n.\n\"ethiopian songs\" \"film song\" \"ethiopian old son\" songs song \"funny songs\" \"funny ethiopia\" sad fun funny\nSew Le Sew Part 108 Part 1 - Ethiopian Drama\n\nSew Le Sew Part 108 Part 1 - Ethiopian Drama\n\nSew Le Sew Part 108 Part 1 - Ethiopian Drama\n\nSew Le Sew Part 108 - Ethiopian Drama\n\nSew Le Sew Part 108 - Ethiopian Drama\n\nSew Le Sew Part 108 - Ethiopian Drama\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 107\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\nsew le sew part 108\n\n\n\n\nayehushe FULL MOVIE\n\nayehushe part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nLaundry Boy Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\nLaundry Boy Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nDiplomat Part 1 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\nDiplomat Part 2 - Ethiopian Movie\n\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n\nNew Amharic Movies 2013\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ethiopian songs\" \"film song\" \"ethiopian old son\" songs song \"funny songs\" \"funny ethiopia\" sad fun funny\n\"NEW ETHIOPIAN MOVIE\" \"2014\" \"Ethiopian Comedy 2014 \"\"Ethiopian Comedy\"Ethiopian\"\"Ethiopia\"\"funny\"", "title": "Hello Ethiopia!

Police said they tried to set the store on fire.\n\nSt. Louis County Police tell News 4 there has been more looting of stores near West Florissant.  According to police, a liquor store, an electronics store, and a beauty supply store were looted,\n\nAbout 100 police officers in riot gear moved in to disperse the crowd.  One officer was injured by a thrown brick or rock.\n\nPolice said there was also at least one shooting victim rushed to Christian Northeast Hospital.  No other details about that shooting have been released, other than it took place at the intersection of West Florissant and Canfield Drive.\n\nAt one point, protesters locked their arms and turned their backs to police.\n\nThere are reports that peaceful protesters, including Alderman Antonio French, attempted to calm tensions.  Groups were seen blocking entrances to local stores to keep looters from entering.\nThere are no official reports of arrests being made.  As looting occurred, police dressed in riot gear mainly stood and watched, apparently under orders not to engage.\n\nNews 4's Russell Kinsaul reported police arrived on scene around 6:15 a.m. to make sure only authorized people were inside businesses as well as clearing parking lots. \n\nCommunity members also arrived to start the clean-up process for businesses damaged by looters.", "title": "Looters Rob Liquor Store In Ferguson, Missouri (8/16/2014) Michael Brown Shooting Aftermath", "publishedDate": "2014-08-16T14:40:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "3EYkMi_J9l0", "description": "This is not a song cover.

These people were bomb throwing terrorists and double agents. So they're there on\u2014they don't pay, see. These are the Czar's, the Czarist Secret Police, just exactly reminiscent of the KGB. They even attacked a horned owl with their umbrellas, like so many animated cartoon figures\u2014but one hell of a lot worse. \n\nThey believed the earth was flat, and no wonder because that means trouble. They believed a man splitting his own head with an ax does not conform to your preconceived standards. He was one of us, whoever we are. His work will be judged on its own merit. \n\nThey were both rather like the odor eaters in Tibetan mythology, smelling of raw onions and spirits, and they both had the same trick of half finished sentences...
