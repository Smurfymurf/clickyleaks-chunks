New art photography of Jurek Wajdowicz. Published by Lars M\u00fcller Publishers -- Z\u00fcrich (2013)\nBook design: Jennifer Sterling. Introduction: Fred Ritchin  \n\nFrom author and critic Fred Ritchin: \"...Seeing and looking are hardly the same. The riches reside as well in the parallel universes, those which conventional photography, quoting from appearance, hardly seem to take into account. In the hints and smatterings of shape in Wajdowicz's own images, in his embrace of negative space, appearance manages to conceal itself, implying the gaps of the forever in-between. The engaged viewer can then infer ways to re-imagine, while Jurek's lens argues for a less traveled space. It is no wonder that his imagery reads like jazz...\"\n\nFrom book designer Jennifer Sterling: \"The dual emotions of aloneness and melancholy seem to be a relevant concept when grasping the minimalist abstractions that are Jurek Wajdowicz's photographs. To say \"photographs\" at once defies the visual impact that is experienced when first viewing one of his oversized artworks, which blend his subject matter into the intimate and then strip it of any mundaneness. Indeed, his pictures are\u2014at most times hard pressed to be labeled photography, as the viewer walks away with something intimate, sad, melancholy and surprisingly ethereal while striving to believe he has actually viewed a photograph and not a painting.\"\n\nPolish-born American art photographer and designer Jurek Wajdowicz is the principal of the renowned Emerson, Wajdowicz Studios (EWS) in New York, which he runs together with his design partner Lisa LaRochelle. EWS is known for their creative work for prominent nonprofit organizations worldwide.\n\nWajdowicz is recognized internationally as a leader in the photojournalistic approach to graphic design. In the recent survey of Graphic Design: USA, Wajdowicz was selected among the \"Most Influential Graphic Designers of the Past 50 Years.\"\nJurek Wajdowicz work resides in the permanent collections of the U.S. Library of Congress, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the Warsaw Museum of Posters, the United Nations, the Lodz Museum of Modern Art, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Paris Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs and the Hamburg's Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe, among others.", "title": "Liminal Spaces.

It would take a heavy toll on anyone if something they've known for all their lives were actually a mistake.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nTomoNews is your daily source for top animated news.

It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who tries to legitimize his criminal empire. The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events\u2014the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981-1982\u2014and links them with each other and with the affairs of Michael Corleone. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy Garc\u00eda, and features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.\nCoppola and Puzo originally wanted the title to be The Death of Michael Corleone. However, Paramount Pictures would not accept that title. Coppola states that The Godfather series is in fact two films, and Part III is the epilogue. Part III has received mixed reviews and receptions, but nevertheless grossed $136,766,062 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards.\n\nPlot: Michael Corleone is nearing 60 and wracked with guilt for his ruthless rise to power, including ordering the murder of his brother Fredo. By now, he has mostly retired from the Mafia, leaving the Corleone family's criminal interests in the hands of former enforcer Joey Zasa. Michael and Kay have been divorced since 1959, and Michael gave her custody of their children, Anthony and Mary. He has since returned to New York City, where he is using his tremendous wealth and power to restore his reputation via numerous acts of charity. In an attempt to break with the past, Michael creates a charity, the Vito Corleone Foundation.\nAt a ceremony in St. Patrick's Old Cathedral Michael is named a Commander of the Order of St. Sebastian. At a party following the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion. Anthony tells his father that he is going to drop out of law school to pursue a career as an opera singer. Kay supports his choice, but Michael disagrees, wishing that his son would either finish law school or join the family business but Anthony refuses. Michael eventually acquiesces to Anthony's wishes.\nMeanwhile, Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's late brother Sonny, shows up at the party. He is embroiled in a feud with Zasa, who has involved the Corleone family in major drug trafficking and turned Little Italy into a slum. In Michael's study, a discussion between the two men erupts into a fight, in which Vincent bites Zasa in the ear. Michael scolds Vincent for losing his temper, but ultimately agrees to take Vincent under his wing.\nThat night, as Vincent has a one-night stand with a journalist he met at the party, two men break in and try to kill him. Vincent quickly gains the upper hand, and learns that Zasa is the one who sent them. Meanwhile, Michael busies himself with the biggest deal of his career: he has recently bought up enough stock in Immobiliare, an international real estate holding company known as \"the world's biggest landlord\", to control six of the 13 members of the company's board of directors. He now makes a tender offer to buy the Vatican's 25% interest in the company, which will give him majority control. Knowing that Archbishop Gilday, who serves as head of the Vatican Bank, has run up a massive deficit, he offers to pay $600,000,000 to the Bank in exchange for the shares.\nDon Altobello, an elderly New York Mafia boss and old friend of the Corleones (as well as Connie's godfather), soon visits Michael, telling him that his old partners on the Commission want in on the Immobiliare deal. A meeting is arranged, and Michael appeases most of the Mafia bosses with payoffs from the sale of his Las Vegas holdings. Zasa, however, gets nothing, and declares that Michael is his enemy and storms out. Altobello follows close behind.. Minutes later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and sprays it with submachine gun fire. Most of the other mob bosses are killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael's bodyguard, Al Neri, escape. Back at his penthouse in New York, Michael is told that those mob bosses who escaped the massacre quickly made deals with Zasa, and realizes that Altobello supported Zasa in...", "title": "Mary is Hit SCENE - The Godfather: Part 3 MOVIE (1990) - HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-06T21:27:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "2UYTiJ4DTyY", "description": "Pitt and UNC battled all game until the last minute when North Carolina recovered a fumble from Chad Voytik to seal the victory.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Pitt vs North Carolina | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-11-15T22:07:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2UYloLPSmcs", "description": "Garden Splendor's\u00ae Dicentra Candy Hearts PP#14,692 combines the reliability, ease, and performance of the native species, with the striking, pale blue foliage color of its Japanese relative.

The Giant Millipede can get up to ten inches in length, and 400 legs.

The excretory organs are two pairs of malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut.\n\nDue to their lack of speed and their inability to bite or sting, millipedes' primary defense mechanism is to curl into a tight coil protecting their delicate legs inside an armored body exterior.

Alok has embraced Laxmi despite the scars on her face, and the duo are now taking up the cause to fight against acid attacks. The couple is now running a campaign 'Stop Acid Attacks' and helping victims of brutal acid attacks. In 2005, 15-year-old Laxmi was attacked by a jilted lover, who poured a glass full of acid over her face in broad day light in a Delhi market. Her face was disfigured and she faced severe social stigma and was 'rejected' by the society. Laxmi became the face of women's rights struggle as she went on to file public interest litigations in India's highest court, seeking changes in law and asked government to take steps to stop acid attacks on women.\n\nVideographer / Director: Arkaprava Ghosh\nProducer: Aamir Bashir\nEditor: Ian Phillips\n\nFor more amazing footage of the amazing side of life, visit the \nLike Barcroft TV on Facebook: http://goo.gl/7ayYgY\nFollow Barcroft TV on Twitter: http://bit.ly/10vFLY9\nFollow Barcroft TV on Instagram: http://bit.ly/1b84Ku0\nBarcroft Media website: http://bit.ly/19OYwp", "title": "Acid Attack Victim Finds Love With Fellow Campaigner", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T10:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "2UpneC4zsCw", "description": "", "title": "Stupid girl falls", "publishedDate": "2011-11-25T08:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Uq3dOru52c", "description": "Artist : Last Hoper\nSong : [Ohana]\n#LIVE IN GUNSDOWN Festival 2013#\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lasthoper.band\n\nby RebirthVDO", "title": "Last Hoper [Ohana] : LIVE IN GUNSDOWN Festival 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-06-26T11:07:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2UqCaH2DDfU", "description": "This table is more than just a table.

This communication type was first introduced by \"AT&T\" (USA) in 1932, which began to provide \"Teletypewriter Exchange Service\" (TWX). Switching was performed manually and it was automated after World War II. Similar services in Europe called \"telex\" were introduced in early 1930s. In 1962 \"Western Union\" company started to provide the international telex service in the U.S. and in 1970 it purchased the TWX division from \"AT&T\". It was not possible to telex at the international level till then because of the differences in codes and transmission rates. \"Western Union\" company united these two systems through processing centers network, which implemented the necessary changes. The experiment Cybersyn was set in early 70s, in which Telex appliances and IBM 360 computers developed an information network that was later called the socialist internet. Users of the network could get information about the state of economic sectors in real time. The project was derailed in 1973 after the coup in Chile.

Behind its beautiful, vivid colors and graceful swimming there is a danger: it stings beachgoers and swimmers. Although most accidents are mild or harmless, they are painful; this species is responsible for about 80% of the accidents caused by marine organisms in the Southern and Southeastern coasts of Brazil (Vidal Haddad Jr., pers. commun).\n\nThe umbrella of an adult specimen may reach 10 cm wide. Around the umbrella margin there are 3 types of tentacles. The dark red or brownish primary tentacles are relatively short and rigid, and are inserted above bell margin; they are usually kept still, being provided with cnidocyst clusters in transverse or oblique clasps (do not completely clasping the tentacles). The bright yellow secondary tentacles are inserted on the bell margin, being long, thin and very extensible; they are provided with complete or incomplete rings of cnidocysts. The third type are small and numerous, club-shaped tentacles on the bell margin. An adult medusa may have more than 400 tentacles, all of them full of cnidocysts. At the base of the primary tentacles, near the ring canal, there is a pair of internal statocysts. Four radial canals connect the stomach to the ring or circular canal. Several centripetal canals issue from the ring canal. The gonads are situated on the radial canals.\n\nOlindias sambaquiensis was described by the German-born naturalist, Fritz M\u00fcller, who lived in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, between 1852 and 1897. The species is endemic to the South Atlantic coast. The medusa lives near the bottom, and its life cycle includes a tiny polyp (obtained in the laboratory and not yet found in nature).\n\nThe v\u00eddeo was recorded in the laboratories of the Centro de Biologia Marinha, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, SP, Brazil (CEBIMar-USP) (usp.br/cbm).

LACRISERT\u00ae is indicated especially in patients who remain symptomatic after an adequate trial of therapy with artificial tear solutions. LACRISERT\u00ae is also indicated for patients with exposure keratitis, decreased corneal sensitivity, and recurrent corneal erosions.\n\nImportant Safety Information\nDo not use LACRISERT\u00ae if you are allergic to hydroxypropyl cellulose. Instructions for inserting and removing LACRISERT\u00ae should be carefully followed. If improperly placed, LACRISERT\u00ae may result in a scratch to the cornea of your eye. Because LACRISERT\u00ae may cause temporary blurred vision, please use caution when driving or operating machinery. Rubbing the eye(s) containing LACRISERT\u00ae should be avoided. You should always discuss this safety information with your doctor. The following adverse reactions have been reported but were in most instances mild and temporary: temporary blurring of vision, eye discomfort or irritation, matting or stickiness of eyelashes, increased sensitivity to light, eyelid swelling, and eye redness. Talk to your doctor if you have side effects that bother you or that do not go away. You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.FDA.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.\n\n*For most Dry Eye sufferers, one LACRISERT\u00ae inserted in each eye in the morning lasts the entire day. But some people may need to use it twice a day for symptom relief.1\n\nReferences: 1. Lacrisert [prescribing information].

Characteristics including age and reason for toilet training, method of training, and encopresis or constipation were compared between both groups.\n\nResults: Initiation of toilet training prior to 24 months and later than 36 months of age were associated with dysfunctional voiding. However, dysfunctional voiding due to late toilet training was also associated with constipation.\n\nConclusion: Dysfunctional voiding may be due to delayed emptying of the bowel and bladder by children. The symptoms of dysfunctional voiding are more common when toilet training early, as immature children may be less likely to empty in a timely manner, or when training late due to (or in association with) constipation.\n\nRead the original article here: http://www.dovepress.com/the-association-of-age-of-toilet-training-and-dysfunctional-voiding-peer-reviewed-article-RRU.", "title": "Toilet

Every single muscle that attaches to the pelvis is addressed and all muscle tension eradicated through specific deep intentional gauging of the soft tissue. Tension and pain coming from Ligamentous and tendinous tissue is eradicated through deep gauging of the tissue and moxabustion (a unique ancient Chinese heat treatment with amazing healing properties). Once the tension and pain from extremely tight muscles deep in the groin and hip region is eradicated, the athlete will gain pain free movement, but will still require the weak muscles causing the imbalance and core/ pelvic stabilising muscles addressed.\n\nPostural Transformation power training: Full body functional compound exercises are completed under supervision from the therapist. The exercises stretch all tight muscles and strengthen all weak muscles all through the same movement. Muscular imbalances are eradicated with every session bringing the body back to its symmetrical state. Once symmetry is returned to the athlete's body, pain free training and participation can be resumed. Not only will the athlete be free of pain and restriction, but will have amazing amounts of power, strength and speed even more so that before they had osteitis pubis.", "title": "Osteitis Pubis/Groin Treatment Melbourne -  (03) 9998 1988", "publishedDate": "2011-11-09T23:32:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VNPv9-vfcw", "description": "**UPDATE** Featured on Equestria Daily!\nhttp://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/trailers-and-sfm-gypsy-bard-chaos-is.html#more\n\n**UPDATE 2 (May 14, 2013)** 100,000 views!!!

You can either take the damage, or run from it- depending on how confident you are.\n\nSpawn Timer: I can't be 100% sure about the spawn timers on any rare because it's always random. However, the spawn timer for most rares for the Glorious achievement seem to be somewhere between 30 minutes and 24 hours. However, with all of the current activity in Mists of Pandaria -- the spawn timers seem to be much more frequent than what most people are used to. (I've seen them average at around 2 hours or 6 depending on server activity).\n\nMy advice if you aren't camping: Check about every 3 hours and stay for about 15 minutes before leaving again.\n\nExtra info:\n\nDrops: All pandaria rares currently have the chance to drop 1 or more of the following:\n- a Green quality bag with random goodies in it. (Cloth, Gold, Motes of harmony, Ore, etc.)\n- a blue quality item piece. \n- a rare specific vanity item or pet.\n- Korda drops [Foragers Gloves] these gloves increase the gathering speed of your professions.

All she ever wanted was for me to pick her up and hold her like a baby, all the time, always. Unfortunately my time with her was short. She suffered a condition from birth which was diagnosed as cerebellar hypoplasia, just like in cats. She was unable to control her muscles and could barely walk and barely feed herself. Her condition progressed, caused seizures more and more often and one day I found her at the bottom of her cage with her head in the shallow gravity water bowl. She had a seizure with half of her nose in 1/4\" of water and she slowly drown to death from it. \n\nThe loss of this one critter still haunts me to this day. Not only was she a very rare animal to keep as a pet in any country, but she was simply very special.

So, if you have a bookkeeper who is not allocating expenses correctly or is not accurately keeping track of everything within your business then the information you draw out in terms of your Profit and Loss Statements and other reports is pretty much useless. As the business owner, you have a responsibility to make sure that your bookkeeper is doing what they need to and that they highlight anything else that is important to your business. How?\n\nAsk your bookkeeper or prospective bookkeeper lots of questions. You need to find out what type of clients they are currently working with and what type of clients they have worked with in the past. You also need to know whether they usually work with home based and small businesses or if they have larger companies on board.\n\nSecondly, ask them to produce a specific report for you. I would suggest your Profit and Loss Statements for the last three years. Then ask them to explain this report to you. Ask questions based on the report and make sure the bookkeeper is comfortable providing you with correct answers. Ask them for their opinion on your business' performance, what your gross profit is and to provide comparisons from year to year and the like.\n\nIf your prospective bookkeeper or current bookkeeper can easily produce reports and answer these types of questions then this bookkeeper will not just enter data. Anyone in your business can punch the numbers into the system and allocate them to a specific spot. However, if they do not understand why the numbers are being allocated to specific places or what they are allowed to claim in terms of GST and tax, they may not feed the correct information into your software and you won't receive the correct information in your reports.\n\nFinally, you need to ask for referrals and/or the contact details of the accountants of the clients your bookkeeper is currently serving. As a bookkeeper the information they feed into the system feeds down to the accountant, so their clients' accountants should be able to tell you if the information they are receiving has been correct and reliable for that specific business.\n\nBe sure to visit http://www.efinancialmanagement.com.au to get my Top 3 Tips to Profit and Cash Flow Success!

One benefit of reading the Latin language is that it contains almost no silent letters, so you should pronounce the word exactly as it is spelled. This minimizes most guess work on how to say Latin phrases. Use the scientific terms below as examples, and try to pronounce them yourself:Carcharodon carcharias (kar-KAR-uh-don kar-KAR-ee-uhs) - Great white shark.\u00a0Manta birostris\u00a0(MAN-tuh BY-ros-truhs) - Giant manta ray.c\u00a0c\u00a0\n\nStep 2: Practice on Everyday Terms\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPractice saying scientific names as much as possible. You can use items found around your office or house. The ingredients list for many packaged and processed foods contains common scientific names you can read aloud, like monosodium glutamate, phosphoric acid, etc.c\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStep 3: Use Proper Formatting to Write the Word\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to writing scientific names, it's important to pay attention to font and style. Be sure to use italics to denote a scientific name when typing; underline it if writing by hand.\nFor biological organisms, such as plants and animals, there will typically be two words in the name--the first word is the genus (which is always capitalized) and the second is the species (which is never capitalized).\u00a0This is called\u00a0binomial nomenclature, a formal system of naming species typically used in botany and zoology.\nc\u00a0\nFor example, when pronouncing the scientific name for the Great white shark,\u00a0\nCarcharodon\u00a0is the genus,\u00a0while\u00a0carcharias\u00a0is the species.c\u00a0\n\nRead more by visiting our page at:\nhttp://www.mahalo.com/how-to-read-scientific-names/", "title": "Learn Biology: How to Read Scientific Names", "publishedDate": "2010-12-31T02:10:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VVS1QowjeI", "description": "This short clip gives you an introduction to our New Zealand webinars, which are around one hour in length and come with a slideshow presentation. \n\nTo watch the rest of this presentation, or to find out more, visit our website, www.webinar.lexisnexis.co.nz, email webinar@lexisnexis.co.nz or call 0800 WEBINAR.", "title": "Preview: Distrust of Family Trusts", "publishedDate": "2010-06-27T22:13:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VV_KsIcf24", "description": "Highlights of the Illini's 65-64 win in the \"Braggin' Rights\" game vs. #23 Missouri on 12/21/13.", "title": "Illinois Basketball Highlights vs. #23 Missouri 12/21/13", "publishedDate": "2013-12-22T02:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VVbfFwxD6Y", "description": "Sorry for the bad quality.

Historically, fractional killing has been attributed to infrequently dividing or nondividing \"persisters.\" Using microfluidic cultures and time-lapse microscopy, we found that Mycobacterium smegmatis persists by dividing in the presence of the drug isoniazid (INH). Although persistence in these studies was characterized by stable numbers of cells, this apparent stability was actually a dynamic state of balanced division and death. Single cells expressed catalase-peroxidase (KatG), which activates INH, in stochastic pulses that were negatively correlated with cell survival. These behaviors may reflect epigenetic effects, because KatG pulsing and death were correlated between sibling cells. Selection of lineages characterized by infrequent KatG pulsing could allow nonresponsive adaptation during prolonged drug exposure.", "title": "Timelapse microscopy of bacteria exposed to INH.", "publishedDate": "2013-01-13T19:09:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Vqnvre6lGA", "description": "", "title": "Moments Of Hotness", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T20:48:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VqqqdbfV7E", "description": "The US military's F-35 fighter jet made its first landing aboard an aircraft carrier on Monday, in what officials called a milestone for the new hi-tech warplane.\n\nThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the most expensive weapons program in US history and has been plagued by technical glitches and cost overruns, but the Pentagon touted the landing at sea a crucial step forward.", "title": "F35 fighter jet completes first carrier landing", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T04:20:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Vrv_ldFcqo", "description": "Full HD Slow Motion White Tailed Sea Eagle catching fish\n\nMore slow-mo birds at: http://birdsinslowmotion.com/\nVisit channel at: https://www.youtube.com/user/Birdsinslowmotion/featured\n\nTotal duration: 2:27\nResolution: 2048x1080\nClip ID: BM2B", "title": "White Tailed Sea Eagle Slow Motion Catching Fish shot with Phantom HD Gold", "publishedDate": "2013-07-09T14:41:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "2VseQet47WY", "description": "Toute l'actualit\u00e9 sur http://www.bfmtv.com/ La journaliste Nadia Le Brun, questionn\u00e9e ce vendredi sur le plateau de BFMTV, a estim\u00e9 que Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler \"est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s amoureuse\" de Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.

For the last couple of years, water levels at the lake have been low which is a result from the lack of rainfall and snow melt. Due to the low water levels, boaters have been forced to take the original channel of the Colorado River to reach the upper portion of the lake. Currently, construction is underway to deepen the Castle Rock Cut, which is a shortcut for boaters to take, cutting off 10-12 miles.

In this video, I will debunk the entirety of Marxism. But first, a brief biography of Herr Doktor Marx (a.k.a. Mr. Douchebag.)\n\nBiography\n\nKarl Marx was a philosopher in the 1800's. Marx invented socialism, communism, and AIDS. He and his butt-buddy Frederick Engels wrote a lot of books against capitalism including Das Kapital, the Communist Manifesto, and a bunch of other shitty books that you should never read.\n\nMarx had no influence in the social sciences because, shortly before he died, marginalist economists debunked everything he ever wrote. The only people who Marx influenced were people like Lenin. And, as everyone knows, Lenin was the same thing as Stalin and Hitler. So way to go, Marx! Your irrational hatred of all things capitalism resulted in the worst genocides in history. In short, Marx caused the Nazis.\n\nSo onto my pwnage of Marxist theory.\n\n1. The Labor Theory of Value\n\nKarl Marx invented the \"labor theory of value.\" Everybody knows that this theory is false because a lot of people think it is false. But since some Marxists (who are basically the same thing as Christian fundamentalists) still believe in it, I will debunk it.\n\nMarx said that labor creates value. So if I spend like 100 days making a shit sandwich then it will be worth like a bajillion dollars, right? Man. What an idiot. This moron Marx spent years writing three volumes of his shitty book \"Das Kapital\" and he didn't even see this problem? What a fucking chump! LOL!\n\nSome Marxists say that not just any labor can create value. They claim that only \"socially necessary labor time\" determines value. This is wrong because it is retarded. The only reason people value commodities is because they think that commodities are useful. When I go to the 7-11, I don't value my Slurpee because it took X amount of labor time to make.\n\nNow, Marxtards might counter my claim by saying that I am using the word \"value\" in a totally different sense. To them I say: \"fuck you!\"\n\nCapitalism - 1 \nMarx - 0\n\n2. \"Exploitation\" & \"Surplus Value\"\n\nMarx said that capitalists exploit workers by taking the surplus value created in production for themselves. Since I debunked the LTV, I don't really have to talk about \"surplus value\" too much. Plus, Fringe Elements debunked it in his new video, so just watch that. Fringe Elements has an in-depth understanding of the Marxist notion of \"surplus value\" and how stupid it is, so he should be treated as an authority on the subject.\n\nLabor doesn't create value. But even if we are to accept the LTV, why would capitalists want to \"exploit\" their workers? Their workers would all just quit and find jobs working for better capitalists. Capitalism compels capitalist to treat workers well!\n\nPlus, capitalists ARE workers! They have jobs and they go to work! They just get paid more because they are good at what they do.\n\n3. Communism\n\nKarl Marx also invented the idea of communism. Basically, communism is when the government runs everything and everyone is forced to be equal. \"Equality\" is against human nature because people are naturally greedy and self-centered.\n\nOf course, sometimes people don't act greedy or self-centered, but come on! Capitalism allows everyone to enjoy the fruits of their labor. It is the most personally-fulfilling way to organize a society!\n\nThe failure of the Soviet Union should cut off all debate about a post-capitalist society. Capitalism is natural and has always been with us in some way. Communism is an artificial, alien imposition that can never work. Without a profit motive, the world would fall apart.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMarxism is stupid, pre-marginalist mysticism. Nobody should even bother to learn about it.

The karambit spelling is mostly used in the Philippines. In Western literature it is occasionally misspelled as \"korambit\".\nAs proven by its etymological roots, the kerambit originated in West Sumatra \nwhere, according to folklore, it was inspired by the claws of big cats. As with most weapons of the region, it was originally an agricultural implement designed to rake roots, gather threshing and plant rice. As it was weaponised, the blade became more curved to maximise cutting potential. Through Indonesia's trade network and close contact with neighbouring countries, the karambit was eventually dispersed through what are now Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand.\nCulturally the kerambit was a subject of condescension in Java because of its history as a weapon of the agrarian peasantry, as opposed to the kesatria (warrior class) who were trained in the keraton or palace. European accounts tell that soldiers in Indonesia were armed with a kris at their waist or back and a spear in their hands, while the kerambit was used as a last resort when the fighter's other weapons were lost in battle. Nevertheless it was popular among women who would tie the weapon into their hair to be used in self-defense. Even today, silat practitioners regard it as a feminine weapon. The renowned Bugis warriors of Sulawesi were famous for their embrace of the kerambit. Today it is one of the main weapons of silat and is commonly used in Filipino martial arts as well.\nSuperficially the kerambit resembles the jambiyah but there is no connection. The jambiyah was always designed as a weapon and serves as a status marker, often made by skilled artisans and jewelers using precious stones and metals, whereas the kerambit was and still remains an unadorned, modest farmer's implement and useful utility knife.\nWhile it is primarily used in a slashing or hooking motion, kerambits with a finger ring are also used in a punching motion hitting the opponent with the finger ring, as well as some kerambits are designed to be used in a hammering motion. This flexibility of striking methods is what makes it so useful in self-defense situations. The finger guard makes it difficult to disarm and allows the knife to be maneuvered in the fingers without losing one's grip.\nGenerally, the short Filipino karambit has found favor in the West with some martial artists because such proponents allege the biomechanics of the weapon allow for more powerful cutting strokes and painful \"ripping\" wounds, and because its usability is hypothesized as more intuitive, though there continues to be debate about this matter.\nThere are many regional variants of kerambit. The length of the blade, for example, could vary from one village or blacksmith to another. Some have no finger guard and some feature two blades, one on each side of the handle. Traditional Indonesian forms of kerambit include:\n\n    kerambit kuku bima: Bima's nail kerambit, endemic to West Java\n    kerambit kuku Hanuman: Hanuman's claw kerambit, endemic to West Java\n    kerambit kuku macan: tiger's claw kerambit, endemic to Sumatra, Central Java and Madura\n    kerambit Sumbawa: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From the Sumba Islands\n    kerambit Lombok: larger, sturdier kerambit made specially for battle. From Lombok\n    lawi ayam: chicken's claw, created by the Minang community\n\nAdditionally, modern kerambit may have spikes or spurs on the front or rear ricasso, which may be intended for gripping clothing or horse tack, tearing flesh or for injecting a poison, such as the upas\n\ntags : \n\npencak silat, pentjak silat, martial arts, indonesian, malaysian, weapons, knife, knives, karambit, cs go, animation,", "title": "The Deadliest Knife in the World : The Karambit", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T22:39:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WAfVWjOMZA", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amputee-OT/601887559840195\n\nHey everyone!\n\nMy youtube name, AmputeeOT, actually makes sense now!\n\nI had my surgery on Tuesday, Feb 26th.

Dado el contexto social de la clase y \u00e9poca a la que perteneci\u00f3, la educaci\u00f3n de Teresa Wilms estuvo a cargo de estrictas institutrices, que la adiestraron en todas las materias y deberes propios a la b\u00fasqueda de un conveniente marido. Sin embargo, desde peque\u00f1a, se manifest\u00f3 contraria a los valores y ense\u00f1anzas de su clase, que poco acomodaban a su esp\u00edritu libre y creativo.\n\nCreci\u00f3 de ese modo entre clases de idiomas, lujos y elegantes banquetes, exhibiendo tempranamente su carisma y talento en el piano, el canto y, especialmente, las letras. Fue en uno de esos eventos, celebrado en el palacio de su padre en el verano de 1910, donde conoci\u00f3 al joven Gustavo Balmaceda Vald\u00e9s -familiar directo del malogrado presidente Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda, quien ten\u00eda ocho a\u00f1os m\u00e1s que ella y trabajaba como funcionario del Servicio de Impuestos del Estado. Pese a oposici\u00f3n de ambas familias, Teresa -con diecisiete a\u00f1os de edad y contra la voluntad de sus padres- contrajo matrimonio con Gustavo Balmaceda, relaci\u00f3n de la que nacieron dos hijas.\n\nLos celos del marido y las persistentes inquietudes intelectuales de la joven -decidida a adentrarse en espacios entonces reservados a los hombres socavaron muy pronto el matrimonio, marcando el inicio del destino errante y tr\u00e1gico de la escritora. Entre 1911 y 1914 la familia se traslad\u00f3 a diversas ciudades, tan extremas como Valdivia e Iquique. Fueron per\u00edodos de abismante soledad que sin embargo resultaron muy fruct\u00edferos en el plano creativo: durante estos a\u00f1os se volc\u00f3 a la escritura de sus diarios \u00edntimos y sostuvo una estrecha amistad con influyentes artistas e intelectuales, como el poeta V\u00edctor Domingo Silva. Durante su permanencia en Iquique dio a conocer sus escritos por primera vez en forma p\u00fablica, bajo el seud\u00f3nimo de \"Tebac\", y adhiri\u00f3 a los ideales feministas y anarquistas, inspirada por el discurso la feminista espa\u00f1ola Bel\u00e9n de Z\u00e1rraga y el chileno Luis Emilio Recabarren. Testigo de esta excitaci\u00f3n intelectual, Gustavo Balmaceda la envi\u00f3 de regreso a Santiago, donde qued\u00f3 al cuidado de su familia paterna y, meses despu\u00e9s, fue recluida en el Convento de la Preciosa Sangre. En 1916, tras un intento de suicidio producto del encierro forzoso, escap\u00f3 hacia Buenos Aires.\n\nLa llegada a esta ciudad le permiti\u00f3 abrazar la autonom\u00eda como mujer y como escritora. Comenz\u00f3 colaborando en la revista Nosotros, donde tambi\u00e9n lo hicieron en su oportunidad Gabriela Mistral y \u00c1ngel Cruchaga Santa Mar\u00eda. En 1917 public\u00f3 sus dos primeros libros. Su \u00f3pera prima, Inquietudes sentimentales, conjunto de cincuenta poemas con rasgos surrealistas, goz\u00f3 de un \u00e9xito arrollador entre los c\u00edrculos intelectuales de la sociedad bonaerense. Lo mismo ocurri\u00f3 con su segunda obra, Los tres cantos, trabajo en el que explor\u00f3 el erotismo y la espiritualidad.\n\nEn 1918 se traslad\u00f3 a Madrid. All\u00ed public\u00f3 otras dos obras, ampliamente reconocidas por la cr\u00edtica literaria espa\u00f1ola: En la Quietud del M\u00e1rmol y Anuar\u00ed. La primera es una eleg\u00eda de tono l\u00edrico, compuesta por 35 fragmentos, con la muerte como motivo central. Escrita en primera persona, enfoc\u00f3 su inter\u00e9s en el rol mediatizador del amor de la vida. Anuar\u00ed, en tanto, es un homenaje a un difunto enamorado argentino. De regreso en Buenos Aires, en 1919, public\u00f3 su quinto libro, titulado Cuentos para hombres que todav\u00eda son ni\u00f1os, en el que evoc\u00f3 su infancia y algunas experiencias \u00edntimas, en narraciones de gran originalidad y fantas\u00eda. Luego continu\u00f3 viaje por Europa, visitando Londres y Par\u00eds, pero manteniendo siempre residencia en Madrid.\n\nEl a\u00f1o 1920 se reencontr\u00f3 con sus hijas en Par\u00eds; pero tras la partida de ellas, enferm\u00f3 gravemente. En esta crisis, consumi\u00f3 una gran dosis de Veronal y tras una larga agon\u00eda, falleci\u00f3 el 24 de diciembre de 1921. Ten\u00eda 28 a\u00f1os. En las \u00faltimas p\u00e1ginas de su diario, escribi\u00f3: \"Morir, despu\u00e9s de haber sentido todo y no ser nada...\".", "title": "Teresa Wilms Montt (Un crep\u00fasculo deste\u00f1ido amortaja mi ventana)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T19:02:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WMnwoF0dDc", "description": "Golondrina Negra (Progne elegans) - C\u00f3rdoba - Marzo 2011 - Copyright Avespampa", "title": "Golondrina_Negra2.mpeg", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T23:47:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WMwn4TAKHY", "description": "\u25ba SHOWER PRANK ON ROOMMATE \n\u25baSubscribe to Caspar - https://www.youtube.com/user/dicasp\n\u25baBecome a Sugglet NOW - http://bit.ly/1bIpesb\n\u25baRemember to hit that LIKE button if you enjoyed it :) \n\n\u25baMy Links:\nYouTube main channel: http://youtube.com/ThatcherJoe\nVine: http://vine.co/thatcherjoe\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/Joe_Sugg\nFacebook: http://fb.com/ThatcherJoe\nTumblr: http://JoeSugg.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/Joe_Sugg", "title": "SHOWER PRANK ON ROOMMATE", "publishedDate": "2014-10-20T17:57:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WN7x8LH4Nw", "description": "Reminded me of Danny Glover.

Essentially, pension funds are borrowing money to invest in bonds to boost returns -- the very strategy that contributed to the global debt bubble and led in part to the financial crisis.

Watch the clock to see the Quattro do 5 cycles every second! This demonstrates the unmatched speed of the Adept Quattro robot and technical achievements in robot system performance. This is more than simply motor speeds; to manage the robot doing this much in so little time takes a high performance motion controller, software, and electronics.\n\nTo the user this means increased product throughput, but not at the cost of control over the motions. Adepts SmartController CX and V+ programming language allow the management of the specific motions: speeds, accelerations and accel profiles, end-of-motion tolerances and behavior, etc. When manufacturers look at automation in a cost-per-pick analysis, being able to pick products faster and more reliably means an improvement to the bottom line.\n\nThe unique patented design of the Adept Quattro robot enables this level of performance with its four-arm parallel kinematic (known as PAR-4). This is differentiated from the three-arm delta style robots commonly seen in the industry. The four motors share the load and contribute to the motion, thus reducing the load on the individual joints and allowing greater speeds, higher payloads, and improved performance throughout the entire robots work envelope. http://www.adept.com/products/robots/parallel/quattro-s650h/intro", "title": "High Speed Industrial Robot Adept Quattro Moving Over 300 Cycles Per Minute", "publishedDate": "2009-09-18T17:58:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WRYyLIrSYo", "description": "GUINEE HIT TV \" La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de la culture guin\u00e9enne cha\u00eene de la culture\"  Abonnez-Vous http://www.youtube.com/subscribe_widget?p=Guineehitmusictv   la cha\u00eene Guineene le plus regard\u00e9 sur youtube. pour \u00eatre les premiers \u00e0 \u00eatre inform\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque nouvelle sortie.", "title": "SINGLETON - Horoya (Clip Officiel 2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-15T14:36:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WRgXvdasm0", "description": "This sequence displays NASA/Solar Dynamics Observatory images during the month of January, 2014. \n\nLeft Image: AIA 304, Upper chromosphere and lower transition region (He II)\n\nOn the Right:\n   Top Left: HMI Intensitygram - colored\n   Top Middle: AIA 131, Flaring regions of the corona (Fe VIII, Fe XXI)\n   Top Right: AIA 211, Active regions of the corona (Fe XIV)\n   Bottom Left: AIA 094, Flaring regions of the corona (Fe XVIII)\n   Bottom Middle: AIA 335, Active regions of the corona (Fe XVI)\n   Bottom Right: AIA 193, Corona and hot flare plasma (Fe XII)\n\n\nVideo created using a mixture of Python scripting, ImageMagick, & ffmpeg", "title": "The Sun - January 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-03-07T18:37:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WRkGdaqQl0", "description": "She shared her thoughts with Ellen on the handsome star settling down.", "title": "Julia Roberts on Friend George Clooney's Engagement", "publishedDate": "2014-05-07T05:13:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WRuDAasz-8", "description": "\u00a9 2011 WMG Theophilus London - I Stand Alone [Official Video]\n\nDownload Theophilus London's new track \"Rio\" ft.

And it's not just Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Nigeria and the list goes on and on. Most recently the nation of Cameroon reported over 400 cases in the northern area of the country since September including 65 deaths. The epidemic in Africa has been going on for decades and shows no sign of slowing.\n\nRecent history shows during the 19th century, cholera spread repeatedly from its original reservoir or source in the Ganges delta in India to the rest of the world, before receding to South Asia. Six pandemics were recorded that killed millions of people across Europe, Africa and the Americas. The seventh pandemic, which is still ongoing, started in 1961 in South Asia, reached Africa in 1971 and the Americas in 1991. The disease is now considered to be endemic in many countries and the pathogen causing cholera cannot currently be eliminated from the environment. (from the World Health Organization website).\n\nIn the United States cases are sporadic usually due to consumption of seafood.\n\nCholera is an acute bacterial intestinal disease characterized by sudden onset, profuse watery stools (given the appearance as rice water stools because of flecks of mucus in water) due to a very potent enterotoxin. The enterotoxin leads to an extreme loss of fluid and electrolytes in the production of diarrhea. It has been noted that an untreated patient can lose his bodyweight in fluids in hours resulting in shock and death.\n\nIt is caused by the bacterium, Vibrio cholerae. Serogroups O1 and O139 are the types associated with the epidemiological characteristics of cholera (outbreaks).\n\nThe bacteria are acquired through ingestion of contaminated water or food through a number of mechanisms. Water is usually contaminated by the feces of infected individuals. Drinking water can be contaminated at the source, during transport or during storage at home. Food can get contaminated by soiled hands, during preparation or while eating.\n\nBeverages and ice prepared with contaminated water and fruits and vegetables washed with this water are other examples. Some outbreaks are linked to raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nThe incubation for cholera can be from a few hours to 5 days. As long as the stools are positive, the person is infective. Some patients may become carriers of the organism which can last for months.\n\nCholera is diagnosed by growing the bacteria in culture. Treatment consists of replacement of fluids lost, intravenous replacement in severe cases. Doxycycline or tetracycline antibiotic therapy can shorten the course of severe disease.\n\nThere is an oral vaccine available in some countries but it is not available in the U.S.\n\nCholera prevention is the same as in other causes of traveler's diarrhea.\nhttp://EzineArticles.com/3189784\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/wikistd\nhttp://youtu.be/2WVc7JQzHYM", "title": "What is Cholera", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T08:20:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WVnHJIHljQ", "description": "Inhuman Depravity first song at '' Collapsing Into Depravity '' Demo\n\nOfficial Facebook Page : https://www.facebook.com/Inhumandepravity", "title": "Inhuman Depravity - Exhuming The Creator For Own Expediency", "publishedDate": "2013-09-29T14:38:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WWbNRCm6ik", "description": "Les danseuses et les danseurs du Lido invit\u00e9s chez une \u00e9mission de France 2.\n\nhttp://www.lido.fr\n\nhttp://stella-demaris.blogspot.it", "title": "Le Lido de Paris sur France 2", "publishedDate": "2014-02-24T17:23:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WWie6Mg6EQ", "description": "What is a Medicare HMO?

Su autor\u00eda se atribuye al escultor Prax\u00edteles del per\u00edodo cl\u00e1sico final o bien, seg\u00fan otros autores, se tratar\u00eda de una copia del siglo I de un original del mismo artista del 350-330 a. C. Se encontr\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 1877 entre las ruinas del templo dedicado a Hera donde serv\u00eda como ornamentaci\u00f3n. Se trata de una obra escult\u00f3rica exenta, inspirada en la mitolog\u00eda griega.\nLos conceptos de perfil griego, nariz griega y curva praxit\u00e9lica han pasado a ser un modelo de belleza cl\u00e1sica dentro del arte de la escultura.\n\nEl estado griego firm\u00f3 con Alemania, en 1874 un acuerdo para la exploraci\u00f3n arqueol\u00f3gica en Olimpia. Las excavaciones realizadas por un equipo alem\u00e1n empezaron en 1875 bajo la direcci\u00f3n de Ernst Curtius. El 8 de mayo de 1877 fue encontrada en las ruinas del mismo templo de Heraeum donde lo vio Pausanias.1\n\nSe trataba de una escultura corp\u00f3rea desnuda (cabeza, tronco, piernas y el brazo izquierdo) que representa un joven apoyado en un tronco de \u00e1rbol cubierto con un pa\u00f1o de tela. Se encontraba protegido por una gruesa capa de arcilla, aunque en un estado de conservaci\u00f3n excepcional.\nSe realizaron a\u00fan otros seis descubrimientos diferentes de piezas que faltaban, en otras campa\u00f1as de excavaciones, hasta conformar el grupo escult\u00f3rico como se encuentra en la actualidad expuesto. A la figura de Hermes le faltaba el antebrazo derecho, dos dedos de la mano izquierda, las dos piernas a partir de las rodillas, el pie izquierdo y los atributos sexuales; al ni\u00f1o Dioniso le faltaban los brazos (excepto la mano derecha que la tiene descansando sobre la espalda de Hermes) y la punta del pie derecho. Finalmente, no se consigui\u00f3 localizar gran parte del \u00e1rbol y del pedestal.\n\nEl grupo est\u00e1 tallado en un bloque de m\u00e1rmol de Paros de la mejor calidad. Hermes mide entre 210 y 212 cent\u00edmetros, y la obra completa con la base unos 370 cent\u00edmetros. El pie derecho de Hermes est\u00e1 unido a un trozo de z\u00f3calo, que tiene agujeros que no encajan en la corona de la base, lo que hace pensar que refleja los cambios realizados en la estat\u00faa en alg\u00fan tiempo. Otras partes del grupo est\u00e1n igualmente separadas, y el tronco del \u00e1rbol se adosa a la cadera de Hermes por la colocaci\u00f3n de un puente.\n\nEl rostro y el torso de Hermes se muestran con un perfecto pulido, casi brillante \u00abal que han contribuido\u00bb, comenta haciendo broma John Boardman, \u00abgeneraciones de limpiadoras del templo\u00bb.14 Sin embargo, en la espalda tiene las marcas de los golpes de raspa y del cincel y en el resto de la escultura s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 pulida de manera parcial.\nEn los cabellos, desde su descubrimiento, se aprecian peque\u00f1as huellas de cinabrio,17 un compuesto de sulfuro de mercurio de color rojo, que probablemente no es un color real, sino una preparaci\u00f3n para el dorado.18 El color se encuentra en las correas de la sandalia del pie original, que tambi\u00e9n presenta restos de dorado; adem\u00e1s, la sandalia tiene un dibujo de Heracles, que fue realizado en pintura, y que nace en el motivo tallado de las correas entre los dedos del pie. Los ojos y los labios eran probablemente de color rojo.\nEn la escultura se han hecho esfuerzos para una restauraci\u00f3n de la m\u00e1xima calidad y respetando la obra original. As\u00ed, en la versi\u00f3n que se conserva en el museo de Olimpia, Hermes no tiene los atributos cl\u00e1sicos de llevar un petasos19 en la cabeza, o bien de ir calzado con sandalias aladas. Que llevara un ornamento de una corona de hierba parece lo m\u00e1s probable.20 Con la mano izquierda sujetaba otro atributo: probablemente un caduceo. En general, el brazo derecho en alto de Hermes que le falta, ha sugerido diversas interpretaciones. Parece que el grupo es la representaci\u00f3n del episodio mitol\u00f3gico de Hermes cuando llevaba a Dioniso a las ninfas de la monta\u00f1a Nisa.21 A lo largo del camino, Hermes, para distraer al peque\u00f1o Dioniso, agita un objeto con la mano derecha. Por lo tanto, se supone que Hermes llevaba en la mano un instrumento musical, o tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda ser que sujetara un racimo de uva.", "title": "Hermes y Dionisos. Prax\u00edteles. 360 a.C.

So, I decided to do a little research.\n\nWhy do we need potassium?\n\nPotassium is a mineral found inside body cells. It is one of several minerals known as electrolytes. These minerals (potassium, sodium, and chloride) are found in the fluids inside and outside of body cells. We need about 4700 mg of potassium per day.\n\nPotassium is important because it helps:\n\n-regulate fluid and electrolyte balance\n-maintain normal blood pressure\n-transmit nerve impulses\n-control muscle contraction, including the heart\n-maintain healthy bones.\n\nA food's glycemic index rates the speed at which your body metabolizes carbohydrates and the food's ability to increase blood sugar. All foods are rated from 0 to 100, 100 being pure glucose. 55 and below are considered low. Avoiding foods that create too much of an insulin reaction in your body is the key to controlling diabetes. Unfortunately, many foods that are rich in potassium also rate high on the glycemic index. \n\nHere are some foods that are lower on the glycemic index but pack a potassium punch. Sun-dried tomatoes at 3400 mg are an excellent source of potassium. So are baked sweet potatoes with skin at 508 mg, which are on the lower end of the glycemic index. Beet greens have 655 mg in a half cup, celery 300 mg, 1/2 cup of carrots 177 mg, 1 radish 47 mg, 1 cup of tomato 400 mg, 1 cup of Swiss chard 960 mg, 1/2 cup squash 300 mg, and 1/2 cup spinach 300 mg are other good sources. 100 g white beans 561 mg or 1 cup cooked soy beans 972 mg, nuts 100-200 mg, 1 cup of sunflower seeds has 1300 mg.\n\nImagine if you combined some of the ingredients above in a stew, soup or shake. It would be a yummy potassium super blend. \n\nPlease LIKE my page at http://facebook.com/coachlana where I post videos and fit tips like this one.

Recent scientific studies have shown that over 50% of Americans over the age of 40 have either elevated blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels. \n\nA newly defined condition prehypertension\n(systolic 121-139 / diastolic 81-89) has been shown to increase risk of heart attack and coronary vessel disease (CVD).\n\nPrehypertension presents a dilemma for the treating physician. This condition should not be ignored, it should be treated beyond diet, exercise and lifestyle. Natural pharmaceuticals, prescribed at this early stage could help prevent these warning signs from becoming life-threatening problems.\n\nScientific literature shows that pharmaceuticals, (i.e. beta\nblockers, ace inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, etc.) can lower blood pressure. However, these medications have side effects which make compliance difficult. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, depression, GI upset, diarrhea, slow pulse, sexual dysfunction are just a sampling of the side effects that cause patients to stray from following their doctors recommendations.\n\nBonito Peptides and Probiotics are natural products which have  been scientifically demonstrated to lower blood pressure in many individuals.\n\nBonito peptides are a natural product derived from the Bonito fish. The peptides are extracted, purified and independently assayed for heavy metals, pesticides and other contaminants. These peptides have ace inhibitor activity which lowers blood pressure. They exert\ntheir effect by inhibiting the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) which causes blood pressure to go up. They can successfully reduce blood pressure in a large percentage of people without additional use of pharmaceuticals. There have been no reported side effects from bonito peptides.\n\nClinical studies have shown Bonito Peptides exert significant blood pressure lowering effects in people with high blood pressure (hypertension).2-4 The material appears to be effective in about two thirds of people with high blood pressure  about the same percentage as many prescription drugs.\n\nTo receive Dr. Eisenstein's complementary email newsletter please go to http://homefirst.com/\n \nReferences:\n1.Fujita H, Yoshikawa M.

Learn how to cook in the outdoors the real way -- over a campfire!\n\n\nStep 1: Get permission to make a fire\nCheck ahead to make sure you\u2019re allowed to have a fire at the place you\u2019re planning to camp.\n\nStep 2: Bring along a grill\nConsider grabbing the grate out of your toaster oven or off your backyard barbecue and stashing it with your gear. When you get to your campsite, just balance it between two rocks and you have yourself an instant barbecue grill.\n\nStep 3: Pack cooking essentials\nPack a few things that are essential to cooking over an open flame\u2014heavy-duty aluminum foil, tongs, and potholders or camp gloves. Don\u2019t forget the seasonings!\n\nStep 4: Prep some veggies\nBefore you leave, prep some veggies for kebobs. Cut them into chunks big enough to stick on a skewer, marinate them in salad dressing, and seal them in plastic bags. At the campsite, just stick them on wooden skewers (or braches you\u2019ve cleaned) and hold them over the campfire.\n\nTip\nFor faster cooking, microwave potatoes for three minutes and then refrigerate them before taking them on your trip; they\u2019ll bake much faster.\n\nStep 5: Cook bannock\nMake the classic campfire staple, bannock. Mix together a cup of flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. When you\u2019re ready to cook it, slowly add water until you have about half a cup of firm, sticky dough. Roll out a rope-like shape and wrap it around a skewer or stick. Hold it over a flame until golden brown. Serves two.\n\nTip\nAdd grated cheese or dried fruit to the basic mix for variety.\n\nStep 6: Make pigs in blankets\nMake pigs in blankets. Prepare biscuit mix, wrap some around a hot dog, put the dog on a stick, and hold it over the flame until cooked, about 15 minutes.\n\nStep 7: Make breakfast in a bag\nMake a complete breakfast in a paper lunch bag. Line the bottom with bacon strips \u2013 the grease will help protect the bag from burning \u2013 and then crack an egg or two on top. Fold down the top of the bag until it\u2019s about three inches high, and skewer this folded part with a stick. Hold it about half a foot above the coals for 10 minutes.\n\nTip\nTransport eggs more easily by cracking them into a plastic container before you leave home. They will pour out one at a time.\n\nStep 8: Toast some cheese sandwiches\nToast some cheese sandwiches by finding two sticks sturdy enough to squeeze a sandwich between them like tongs as you hold it over the open flame.\n\nStep 9: Make your own hot pockets\nWrap just about anything in heavy-duty aluminum foil\u2014veggies, hamburger meat, thinly-sliced potatoes\u2014and stick them directly on hot embers.\n\nStep 10: Turn a rock into a skillet\nFind a large, flat rock that you can heat at the edge of your campfire and use it as a skillet to fry a steak or an egg.\n\nStep 11: Extinguish the fire\nWhen you\u2019re done with the fire, put it out with water. Stir the embers into the dirt until they are completely extinguished.\n\nDid You Know?\nHamburgers are the most popular camping food in general, but campers with kids cite hot dogs as their number one campfire meal.", "title": "How to Cook Seven Simple Recipes over a Campfire", "publishedDate": "2008-08-13T18:00:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Wg8d-iQriw", "description": "- Read more at: http://gistonthis.com/pope-francis-breaks-rules-washes-feet-disabled-people-pre-easter-ritual-2/\n\nRome -- Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 disabled and elderly people Thursday -- women and non-Catholics among them -- in a Pre-Easter ritual designed to show his willingness to serve others like a \"slave.\" Francis' decision in 2013 to perform the Holy Thursday ritual on women and Muslim inmates at a juvenile detention center helped define his rule-breaking papacy just two weeks after his election. It riled traditionalist Catholics, who pointed to the Vatican's own regulations that the ritual be performed only on men since Jesus' 12 apostles were men. But as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio frequently performed the ritual on women -- a practice that he seems intent on keeping up now that he is pope. The 2014 edition brought Francis to a center for the disabled and elderly in Rome. Francis kneeled down, washed, dried and kissed the feet of a dozen people, some in wheelchairs, some with grossly swollen and disfigured feet. The Vatican didn't release the exact breakdown of their religious backgrounds, but said they came from various religious confessions. Italian news reports said one was a Libyan Muslim and four were women. Francis told the faithful that he was performing the ritual to remind himself how to serve others, as Jesus did when he washed the feet of his apostles. \"Jesus made a gesture, a job, the service of a slave, a servant,\" he said. \"And he leaves this inheritance to us: We need to be servants to one another.\" Francis began Holy Thursday by presiding over Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrating the priesthood, the start of a busy four days of Holy Week commemorations and preparations for next week's canonization of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII. During his morning homily Thursday, Francis urged his priests to exhibit joy, though he admitted that he too had suffered \"moments of listlessness and boredom which at times overcome us in our priestly life.\"\n\n- Read more at: http://gistonthis.com/pope-francis-breaks-rules-washes-feet-disabled-people-pre-easter-ritual-2/", "title": "Pope Francis Breaks Rules As He Washes Feet of Disabled People in Pre Easter Ritual", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T21:41:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Wh7RPY2AJI", "description": "Ricky Ryan @ Bahrein, Buenos Aires 2010\nMusic: Deep Mariano - Lunar (Ricky Ryan & Ucleden Club Mix)\nLabel: SICK WATONA", "title": "Ricky Ryan @ Bahrein", "publishedDate": "2011-02-16T18:53:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Whn_2hsdnA", "description": "Sinopse do Livro: Shantala - Massagem Para Bebes - Frederick Leboyer\nISBN: 9788571872165\n\nCompartilhe o livro do seu autor preferido.\n\nTamb\u00e9m acesse o nosso site: http://www.achelivros.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=achelivros\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA m\u00fasica usada neste v\u00eddeo \u00e9 de uso livro e foi obtida atrav\u00e9s destes sites: \nhttp://freemusicarchive.org/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music\n\n\nBy Mr. ALS\n\n\nIDACHELIVROS: LC5084960-32394", "title": "Shantala - Massagem Para Bebes - Frederick Leboyer - achelivros.com", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T13:29:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Wi1MKQtTtE", "description": "Hello there!

You may realize that what you are is ever realized and it never needs any more or less realization. And whatever comes on top of it, as a concept or any experience, belongs to that body-mind-organism or whatever kind of idea. It is as fleeting as this (pointing to the body). So that fleeting experience belongs to a fleeting experience. So you have to look for that permanent experience, you have to look for this omnipresence, which is never coming or going, which is the essence of any circumstance and not depending on any change. That is the basis of existence, which is your nature, which is silence and cannot be interrupted by anything, nor given by anyone. No-one can teach it to you or un-teach you that. It cannot be taken, so it cannot be given. So be as you are. And see the dream, or that first notion of existence, which is the second as you are the experiencer of that. You are simply prior to any concept or any experience. And that separate experiencer, if it would be real it would be permanent, but it is always changing, moment by moment. Simply see, that what can change cannot be what you are. As there was in every given moment since you were born, there is that, which is pure perception, which was never changed by anything that was ever perceived or by any circumstance. And see, that relative perceiver, which is changing every moment or every day, is simply part of the scene. But you are that what is in-no-sense. Whatever you can sense is imagination, fleeting shadows, empty or dead you may say. But this life that you are, which is absolute, cannot be touched by that. So be that unborn. And not taking that mistake, becoming a me-steak, for real. With this mistake the whole drama starts. The psychic hospital of the world comes with that mistake: Taking whatever you can experience as real. Even the first \"Atma\", the first soul, the I-idea, already is second. By seeing that you are not what you can experience you are that absolute seer, which can never be changed by anything that can be seen or experienced. And that is silence.

Officials said they tried to take the defective tickets out of circulation when they learned of the printing problem, but the 2,200 misprints were in a batch of 20 million\n\nStory Link:\nhttp://now.msn.com/now/0507-misprinted-lottery-ticket.aspx\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's News Playlist\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD5090A74D500AFDE&feature=view_all\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther Slappinyaface Programs:\n\nJeff and Pat Adventures\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC321500CE7206BA2&feature=view_all\nTwo Single Guys\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0788E0B1F4FA1A9&feature=view_all\nHumans Are Stupid\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1441C5AE5C1EA170&feature=view_all\nAlmost Daily WeightLoss Vlogs\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEF252C4F87726C77&feature=plcp\nFantastic Flabulous Fat Friday WeighIn\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1365183EA38424BA&feature=view_all\n\nmusic provided by:\nhttp://www.partnersinrhyme.com/pir/free_music_loops.shtml", "title": "Man's $1 Million Scratch Ticket Was A Misprint", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T18:00:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WtO6-jX5YU", "description": "***SCROLL DOWN FOR LYRICS***\nRemember to 'Like', 'Comment' and 'Subscribe'!\nMusic: Gamble Rumble from Initial D.\n\nArtist: M.O.V.E.\n\nI do not own the picture or the music.\n\nPicture Link: http://upyourpic.org/images/201108/9zktl266j3.jpg\n\nBring it back yo, rock'en roll!\n\nLife goes on  manzoku shiteta  sukoshi no kibou dake de \nMattereba  dare ka ga mirai kimete kureteita \n(Just get you back and bring it back on)\n\nNante chiisai jibun nan darou?  bust it up! \n(Here we go, 1, 2)  move it up and break it! \nIma sugu yume made hashirou \n(Bring back yo it's the right time, hey boy, rock'en roll)\n\nGamble, you gatta chance to make a Rumble! \nGiri giri no suteeji (oh yeah!) \nGamble, you gatta dive in to a scramble! \nIchi miri mo mayowazu (check it out come on!) \nMamoru beki mono nante  jitsu ha sonna ni nai \n(Give it up yo! give it up yo!) \nSukoshi dake tsuyogatte  kake mashou zenbu  play the game!\n\nLet's gamble hey jumbo now shake your bum and do the rumble \nSurudoku Rain o sanbon  Tension agarippa de banboo \nToujou move sanninjuu  minnasama no anminchuu \nBakuon de  \"omaera uzzai!\"  toka iwaretatte enen to \nI like to move it move it I'll make you move into it \nKokusan no egui noizu kamasu  gingiragin yokubou sarasu \nSutaato kara gooru made matomete waapu shite \nMahha gogo de nuki satte ikou \nTo your next stage\n\nBoy can't you see?  jibun  rashisa o kezutte sugoshiteita \nDaishou ni te ni ireta no ha  furukusai Moraru \n(Just get you back and bring it back on)\n\nOkubyou na kono mure kara ima  bust it up!

This joint, whatever the affliction, has been approached by different professional groups or specialists, some being doctors, others not, some odontologists, others not.  Each has proposed an etiological theory and, on that basis, a treatment protocol.  This is particularly true of everything related to the concept of disk displacement. But also, other pathologies are involved, for which surgical treatment is essential:  condylar fractures, condylar tumors, ankylosis, etc..  Therefore, the idea behind this book, which began to be developed some ten years ago and which has occupied a good deal of my free time, sprang from the need to draw together nearly all the surgical techniques that exist at present.  This has entailed the help of renowned Spanish and international colleagues.  In fact, I wish to express my sincere gratitude for the assistance of fellow members of the American Society of Temporomandibular Joint Surgeons (ASTMJS) and the European Society of Temporomandibular Joint Surgeons (ESTMJS).\n\nThe contents, we believe, follow a suitable order and are enriched with sketches, schematics, figures, tables, clinical photographs, and videos that, thanks to the electronic format of the book, have been possible to incorporate, making the reading more pleasant as well as instructive.  We felt that, throughout this period of giving conferences and courses, receiving colleagues in our services, and undertaking research in the field of TMJ, it was necessary to present a work like this one as a tool to be consulted and to learn from.\n\nIn the acknowledgements section, I would like to present two basic groups.  On one hand, all my peers at the Oral Surgery and Maxillofacial Service of the Hospital de la Princesa (Madrid, Spain), where I received the bulk of my training, and spent the first few years of professional practice.  Everyone there helped me but I would like to personalize my appreciation to my teacher and friend, Professor JR Alonso del Hoyo.  I cannot overlook the two pillars of this career, Dr. JL Gil D\u00edez and Dr. F Rodr\u00edguez-Campo, two superb specialists at this hospital to whom I owe much of my experience.\nOn the other hand, I wish to thank my companions of my Oral Surgery and Maxillofacial Service at the Hospital Universitario Infanta Cristina of Badajoz (Spain).  They have collaborated actively in this project and have devoted time that I cannot return to them.  Special mention goes to Dr. Raul Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda for his selfless dedication in much of the work of this book.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my family for forgiving my spending so much time on scientific projects and appearances, and for being so generous to me.\n\nFlorencio Monje MD, PhD, FEBOMS\nOral and Maxillofacial Surgeon", "title": "Intro IBook - Surgical management of temporomandibular joint Vol1 & Vol 2", "publishedDate": "2014-09-29T15:44:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WvHuDNJeqI", "description": "TRANSITIONAL INSECT FOSSILS", "title": "PL EXAM 2: TRANSITIONAL INSECT FOSSILS.avi", "publishedDate": "2013-02-16T02:29:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WvT3d2WX00", "description": "Download Link : http://goo.gl/n2ATQ", "title": "Soulja Boy - Weed & Shoes", "publishedDate": "2011-03-14T17:48:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "2WvZC_CMmgI", "description": "", "title": "Therenz's First Fish Feeding Experience (April 6, 2014)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-06T13:30:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Ww45i6c4hE", "description": "Videoclip du premier single de Loud ''Orson Welles'' produit par A-JUSTICE.

Set in an idyllic and mystic location about 20kms away from Aizwal, the capital city of Mizoram, the serene and tranquil beauty of Reiek Village adds an amazing charm to the beautiful Anthurium Festival. Beautiful Anthurium flowers grown in Mizoram are put on display and sold during the Anthurium Festival and tours to amazing Anthurium plantations are also conducted during the 3 day festival. What started as a way of promoting tourism and the amazing homegrown Anthurium flowers in Mizoram has slowly become one of the most anticipated festivals for tourists both from within as well as outside the country.\n\nIn addition, Anthurium Festival is an event where all the various Mizo tribes get to come together and showcase their amazing cultures and traditions. The 3 day-long celebrations are marked by a colorful display of various Mizo cultures and traditions; indigenous games and sports, mouth-watering traditional Mizo delicacies, folk songs and dances, traditional methods of harvesting and cooking, handicrafts etc. Various local products of Mizoram like fruit juices, pickles, handicrafts, handloom items, bamboo products etc are also put on display and sold during the festival. Fashion shows and music concerts highlighting the talented Mizos are also an important aspect of the Anthurium Festival.\n\nAnthurium Festival, for a tourist, is indeed a great festive moment to enjoy the vibrant diversity of Mizoram. As a festival that not only highlights the tourism potential of the state but also showcases the amazing culture and tradition of the Mizos, the Anthurium Festival is a must attend.     \n\nSource:- http://reviewne.com/anthurium-festival\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Es una planta perenne, de escaso porte y hojas duras y lanceoladas de hasta un metro de largo, que fructifica una vez cada tres a\u00f1os produciendo un \u00fanico fruto fragante y dulce, muy apreciado en gastronom\u00eda, siendo, de todos los procedentes de Am\u00e9rica Latina el que m\u00e1s \u00e9xito tiene en Europa\n\nAunque la mayor\u00eda de las bromeli\u00e1ceas son ep\u00edfitas, A. comosus es una planta vivaz, terrestre, aparentemente acaule, con una roseta basal de hojas  r\u00edgidas, s\u00e9siles, lanceoladas, estrechamente imbricadas, con los m\u00e1rgenes dotados de espinas cortas, de 30 a 100 cm de largo; son ligeramente c\u00f3ncavas, para conducir el agua de lluvia hacia la roseta. El tallo, rojizo, se hace visible alrededor de los 2 a\u00f1os, creciendo longitudinalmente hasta alcanzar los 120 cm. De las axilas foliares pueden aparecer peque\u00f1os reto\u00f1os que se dispersan para dar lugar a reproducci\u00f3n vegetativa durante este per\u00edodo.\n\nDel tallo brotan inflorescencias en forma de espiga, con el tallo engrosado, formadas por varias docenas de flores tr\u00edmeras de color rosa, que aparecen al final de un escapo en las axilas de las br\u00e1cteas. Las flores son hermafroditas, s\u00e9siles, con br\u00e1cteas inconspicuas, los t\u00e9palos externos apenas asim\u00e9tricos y libres, de ovario hipogino. El per\u00edodo de floraci\u00f3n se extiende por un mes o m\u00e1s; la planta es autoest\u00e9ril, un rasgo seleccionado por los criadores para favorecer la reproducci\u00f3n vegetativa. La polinizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 a cargo, en su entorno natural, de colibr\u00edes.\n\nEl fruto es una peque\u00f1a baya, que se fusiona tempranamente con las adyacentes en un sincarpo o infrutescencia, grande y de forma ovoide. El coraz\u00f3n del sincarpo, m\u00e1s fibroso, se forma a partir del tallo axial engrosado, y las paredes del ovario, la base de la br\u00e1ctea y los s\u00e9palos se transforman en una pulpa amarilla, apenas fibrosa, dulce y \u00e1cida, muy fragante, que no guarda rastro de los frutos que la compusieron. La flor propiamente dicha se transforma en un escudete octogonal de cubierta dura, formada por la fusi\u00f3n del \u00e1pice de la br\u00e1ctea y los tres s\u00e9palos, que formar\u00e1 la dura piel cer\u00falea y espinosa del fruto. La cavidad de la flor endurece sus paredes; seg\u00fan el cultivar aparece como una celdilla vac\u00eda junto a la piel, en la que se conservan los restos duros y filiformes de los estambres, o se reduce a unas ranuras. M\u00e1s hacia el interior las celdas del ovario, que contienen las semillas en el raro caso de fertilizaci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n se estrechan considerablemente.\n\nEl anan\u00e1 puede plantarse en cualquier momento del a\u00f1o en suelos h\u00famedos, aunque la mejor \u00e9poca es el oto\u00f1o. Es rara la reproducci\u00f3n a partir de semilla. M\u00e1s frecuentemente se utilizan los reto\u00f1os del tallo central; los mejores proceden de la parte basal del mismo, aunque tambi\u00e9n pueden usarse las yemas del tallo distal o la corona de br\u00e1cteas de la fruta. Naturalmente, los brotes basales se desarrollan, fructifican y dan a su vez origen a nuevos tallos. Los distintos tipos de reto\u00f1os se conocen como corona (el meristemo apical), gallo  (las yemas pedunculares) y clavos (v\u00e1stagos de la yema peduncular).\n\nLos v\u00e1stagos se plantan en l\u00ednea, dejando 40-45 cm entre plantas y algo m\u00e1s entre hileras, o m\u00e1s si se aplicar\u00e1 pulverizaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica con herbicidas, con una densidad total de 37.500 a 50.000 plantas por hect\u00e1rea. Las plantaciones de fruta con destino industrial son m\u00e1s apretadas, de hasta 80.000 plantas. Se desmaleza dos veces al a\u00f1o; la alternativa es el rociado con herbicidas, en especial ametrina, diuron e incluso uracilos como el caso del bromacil. Se fertiliza tri o bianualmente con nitr\u00f3geno, potasio y f\u00f3sforo, de 5 a 6 g por planta, a los que se a\u00f1ade a veces magnesio. En zonas de heladas la planta debe cubrirse durante la temporada de fr\u00edo.\n\nLa cosecha principal se efect\u00faa normalmente desde principios de verano hasta comienzos de oto\u00f1o; el fruto debe recogerse maduro, pues no contin\u00faa la maduraci\u00f3n una vez extra\u00eddo. El rendimiento del 30% se considera aceptable, es decir, de 12.000 a 18.000 frutos de entre 1 y 2,5 kg por hect\u00e1rea. Normalmente las plantas se renuevan cada dos ciclos de cosecha para evitar la disminuci\u00f3n del rendimiento. Con el uso de etef\u00f3n puede inducirse la floraci\u00f3n para regular el ciclo productivo.", "title": "Cultivo de Pi\u00f1a - Agrotendencia", "publishedDate": "2010-06-05T19:28:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2X3hz3uHpAA", "description": "Here's one of the two arranges I was talking about earlier.

However, his underhanded campaign tactics have proven baseless on many accounts as it has become painfully clear that Heinrich's flailing campaign against Barela is simply a ploy to distract from an unpopular voting record that has only accomplished monumental job loss. Now, Barela is on the air with a new ad pushing back at Heinrich's blatant lies and exposing his vote for the trillion-dollar stimulus that failed to create jobs, but sent taxpayer dollars to Heinrich's favorite bar.\n \n\"As vulnerable Democrat incumbent Martin Heinrich continues to smear Jon Barela with one false attack ad after another, it becomes increasingly obvious just how desperate he has become,\" said Estevan Lujan, Jon Barela for Congress campaign manager. \"New Mexico families deserve a representative in Congress who is independent and committed to serving with integrity -- not someone who continues to use cowardly scare tactics to distract voters from his out-of-touch values and cover up his expensive, job-killing record.\"\n \nFrom an exploitation of a 69-year old woman who misrepresents herself and lies about Barela's position on Social Security to a clear distortion of Barela's work at Intel Corp. -- Heinrich's negative and false campaign ads are dishonest and purposely misleading. The Albuquerque Journal's endorsement of Barela for Congress on October 23, 2010 called the Heinrich ads \"baloney\" and said they contained \"zero evidence\".\n \nTo make matters worse, Heinrich voted for the trillion dollar stimulus bill that failed to create jobs, but helped funnel nearly 1 million dollars of taxpayer money in the form of stimulus funds to O'Niell's Pub and Grill according to Recovery.gov. The owner of O'Niell's Pub, an active Heinrich campaign donor, has allowed Heinrich to use the venuefor several campaign events including Heinrich's own birthday party in October of 2008 and fundraisers this past September and one just yesterday.\n \nNew Mexico families and small businesses have suffered long enough under the Pelosi-Heinrich job-killing agenda -- but next week, the people of New Mexico will have the chance to vote for Jon Barela, a responsible, independent leader to represent them in Washington. \n \nTRANSCRIPT: \nNarrator: Martin Heinrich smear ads so false the Journal calls them \"Baloney\", \"Zero evidence\".\nHiding the damage he has done.\nHeinrich voted for Pelosi's Stimulus that failed to create jobs. But it gave $1 million to Heinrich's favorite bar.\n$1 million to a bar that hosted Heinrich's fundraisers and birthday parties while families suffered.\nWhen we needed help, when we needed jobs, Martin Heinrich let us down.\nIt's time for him to go.", "title": "Baloney", "publishedDate": "2010-10-25T04:34:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "2X4mvH6d4KU", "description": "On DIVORCE COURT this week, Judge Lynn Toler gives one wife a bit of advice for a successful marriage! \"You just have to be quiet,\" she tells a DIVORCE COURT litigant who's demanding another baby from her husband.

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Eczema Medication", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T10:23:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "2X9V5lXLbDs", "description": "Buy 2011 Collection Dresses at http://www.shewah.com/latest-collection/new-fashion-dresses-in-pakistan-2011.html\n\n-New Fashion Dresses in Pakistan\n \n--Latest Fashion in Salwar Kameez\n \nShewah Online Boutique provides its valued customers with New Fashion Dresses in Pakistan.

I'm a reading and learning specialist at a private school in New York City and I work with Kindergarteners through 3rd graders on Reading, Word Study, and Writing Skills. In addition to be a reading specialist and learning specialist, I'm also a parent and today I'm going to talk to you about topics in reading\n\nBeing able to name the letters in the alphabet is one of the critical predictors of reading success. There are several different activities that you can use to teach your child the alphabet. Most people like to start teaching using the alphabet song which is a completely acceptable way to start. In fact, most children in this country know that song; could sing it in their sleep, probably. That is a perfectly fine way to start as long as you move quickly away from singing the alphabet to saying it. Because if your child can say the alphabet without relying on a melody then you can be certain that he knows it for sure. I always like to use visual aids and I think that any teaching, when it can be multisensory, is going to be much more effective. If you can have your child say the alphabet, each letter at a time while pointing to it, they're getting that tactile feedback and also the auditory feedback from pronouncing the letter name, looking at the letter and touching it with his finger.\n\nAnother really helpful manipulative are these 3D letters. These are mine and they're just regular block letters that you can do out of order or move around. So they can be easily manipulated. And again it's a letter identification task.\n\nAnother great teaching tool I like to use is this alphabet mat. It's got the alphabet in block letters across the top as both a reminder and also a point and say task. And then you can also go back to your 3-dimensional letters and, as a separate or additional activity, put the letters in sequence going around the arc. So up here is my \"M\", I place the \"M\" on the \"M\". \"A\" and then \"B\" going all the way around. Knowledge of the sequence of the alphabet is also going to be really helpful to your child going forward. Simple flash cards are also a great tool. These are my upper-case flash cards and you just go one by one and ask your child to name the letter as you go through.\n\nFor more advanced alphabet learners, this is called a missing letter deck. You are prompting the child with two letters to give you the third one that's missing. So in this case it's \"D\", \"E\" and your child will say \"F\". Go on to the next one: \"F\", \"G\"... \"H\". And so on. Again, knowledge of letter names is one of the most important predictors of how quickly and easily your child will acquire early reading skills. And it's important that letter names be taught explicitly and directly, starting in preschool.", "title": "How to Teach the Alphabet | Reading Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T18:03:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "2XH132s9Mn4", "description": "Veja mais em www.fisicareal.com", "title": "Experimento de Torricelli", "publishedDate": "2011-02-18T12:03:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "2XHx_YqNeqY", "description": "A super easy recipe for Mexican rice a.k.a Spanish rice.

KAATSU Aqua is used by competitive and fitness swimmers as well as water polo players and those recovering from injuries.\n\nKAATSU Aqua bands are applied using the KAATSU Master unit in order to determine the optimal pressure for each individual.  It is essential to workout or recover using the correct pressure.  KAATSU Aqua bands are not tourniquets and they are only responsibly and safely used with the correct pressure.\n\nWhen KAATSU belts are applied correctly (both in the proper position and with the optimal pressure which is different from everyone), arterial in-flow is restricted, deep venous out-flow is impeded, and the capillary-venous space becomes distended and congested in the muscle distal to the KAATSU Aqua bands.  \n\nIn layman's terms, the limbs (either the arms or the legs) become engorged in blood, the palms and feet become pink, and the veins pop out somewhat.\n\nMuscle contraction under these conditions of restricted and impeded blood flow and congested vascular space, uses up intracellular phosphates energy stores and oxygen at a rate greater than the circulation can replenish them.  Metabolic waste products accumulate.  Homeostasis in the active muscle is lost.\n\nConsequently, as the tissue becomes more hypoxic and energy stores depleted, anaerobic glycolysis attempts to compensate by increasing its rate, which produces some ATP, but also produces a marked disturbance in muscle homeostasis, ultimately raising intracellular, interstitial and blood lactic acid concentrations.  \n\nIn layman's terms, the limbs feel like the end of a 200 butterfly or 400 individual medley or the end of any race.\n\nHypoxia, acidosis, lactate ion per se, inorganic phosphate, AMP and many other local factors have been shown to turn on transcription and thus, protein synthesis in muscle cells.  This is the so-called \u201clocal effect\u201d of KAATSU that results in stimulation of muscle, tendon and vascular growth.\n\nThe marked disturbance of muscle homeostasis and vascular bed congestion is communicated to the central nervous system (CNS) by group III and IV afferent nerves.  These afferent nerves communicate this \u201cdistress\u201d to the CNS.  It is perceived cortically (consciously), as a type of pain (i.e. what one feels when properly doing KAATSU), but there are many subconscious synapses that stimulate efferent output in a variety of centers.  For example, connections to and in the cardiovascular control centers stimulate an increase in breathing, blood pressure and heart rate.  Another example is hypothalamic release of growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) to the anterior pituitary which releases growth hormone (GH), which in turn, stimulates insulin growth factor I (IGF-I) release from the liver, which is part of the \u201csystemic response\u201d to repair and grow skeletal muscle and repair injury.\n\nIn addition, various substances in the venous blood of the exercising muscle modifies and amplifies the changes occurring from both local and systemic mechanisms as the blood is redistributed to other vascular beds.", "title": "KAATSU Aqua for Competitive Swimmers", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T21:24:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "2XPzObsufa0", "description": "Make sure your electrical panel or circuit breaker is includedin your home inspection.

They are found across Asia, Africa, Europe and the United States covering about 12,000,000 square miles (or 31,000,000 square kilometers). Their global population estimate for 2009 ranged between 450,000 and 780,000 individuals. These birds are most easily recognized by their distinctive jet-black wings and their very long, reddish legs that account for nearly 60 percent of their height. Their maximum lifespan is about 20 years.  The Black-winged Stilts are most commonly observed on the shores of large, inland water bodies and estuarine or coastal habitats, including coastal lagoons, river deltas, swamps, marshes, flooded fields, fish and sewage ponds, as well as shallow pools with areas of mudflats,Breeding birds are usually seen in small groups. Outside the breeding season, or during the migration, these social birds form larger flocks.Both sedentary (non-migratory) and migratory populations exist.Those found in temperate climates are often resident, except for local movements in response to availability of food.Those breeding in northern regions migrate over long distances to reach their southern wintering grounds; or they may move towards the coasts.Southwards migrations typically occur between August and November; and they return to their breeding territories between March and April. These waders generally migrate in large flocks of several hundreds or even thousands.The Black-winged Stilts are legally protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds(AEWA), which prohibits harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing or collecting listed species.The taxonomy of this species is somewhat convoluted. Some separate them as different species, others lump them together. Depending on the source, 2 up to 5 forms are recognized:   Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus [himantopus] himantopus - Linnaeus, 1758) Range: Warmer parts of southern and western Europe and the Mediterranean region, south to northern Africa and Madagascar, and east to central and southern Asia and north central China, Indian Subcontinent, Indochina and Taiwan.  ID: Neck and head variable - ranging from all white to white with a black cap and hindneck. There usually is a white band across the upper back.White-headed Stilt (Himantopus [himantopus] leucocephalus - Gould, 1837) Range: Southeastern Indonesia - from Java east to New Guinea, and south to Australia andNew Zealand. Travel north to winter in the Philippines, Greater Sundas and Sulawesi.ID: All white head and neck. Black behind.

It was in 1982. It would be today, as well. \n\nIt began late on a Thursday afternoon at KRON in San Francisco. Photographer Todd Hanks picked up a desk phone and liked what he heard. \"Freedman, line 26,\" he barked into the newsroom intercom. \n\nAnother call was the last thing I wanted at the end of a day, but I picked it up.  On the other end of the phone, a raspy-voiced woman named Peggy Hawkins sounded half-deranged. \"There is a fly epidemic in the Western Edition!\" she insisted. \"An epidemic! Flies everywhere! You hear me?\"\n\nI was 27 years old, working in a major market, and thought myself a sage, experienced man of the world. \"Ma'am, an epidemic happens when many people become ill. Are you sure this isn't an infestation?\"\n\n\"I don't care what you call it,\" she lectured. \"Just get here.\"\n\nWe spoke for a few more minutes. I assured Peggy that it wasn't the end of the world and, mostly to get rid of her, asked for her number. \n\nGlad I did. The next morning, our assignment people asked me to cover a school board hearing. I groaned. The desk guy smirked. \"If you're so smart, Freedman, what else you got?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said knowingly,  \"there happens to be a fly epidemic in San Francisco's Western Addition.\"\n\nIt worked. It never hurts to keep an idea in your hip pocket. My mantra has always been to find a person, tell a story. I could fill 1:40 with a woman who hated flies. \n\nThirty years later, people still ask to see 'Fly Swatter'. It provides an excellent example of how, while technology and delivery methods change, the elements of effective narrative storytelling remain the same. 'Fly Swatter' is hyper-local, but viewers relate to its unusual main character and her problem.  The story has villains, a victim, witnesses, and an expert. Structurally, it weaves action, tension, and resolution through a suspended linear timeline. \n\nPerhaps most significant,  'Fly Swatter' has spontaneity. Hanks and I shot this story in less than half an hour. He began rolling as soon as Peggy Hawkins opened the apartment door while waving that fly swatter in her hand.  We never set lights. We did not use a tripod. Those would have ruined the moment. Consequently, the pictures aren't beautiful. But, they are authentic. And, authentic trumps beautiful pictures almost every time. \n\nAgain, when telling stories with universal appeal, the effective elements never change. \n\n\n\nWayne Freedman is a 51 time Emmy Award winning reporter/MMJ at KGO-TV in San Francisco.

The terrible injury to Neymar which has him out for the remainder of the World Cup coupled with the yellow card accumulation suspension for Thiago Silva has the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o wondering where they are going to turn.\n\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\n\nBoth are devastating blows for Brazil as they now must find a new focal point on the offense and have to replace half of the dominant central defense that is a huge reason why the Brazilians are still alive. However, the injury has completely changed the expectations on the pre-tournament favorites. Now they are seen as a slight underdog to Germany, and the country who came into the tournament preaching a win-or-bust mentality suddenly have the pressure lifted. Therefore, it may allow them to play a more free-flowing game like the Brazil of old rather than the somewhat subdued version that's shown up so far. It's more than likely that Dante will be the man who takes Thiago Silva's place, which is obviously a dropoff, but not one Brazil cannot overcome, but it's the decision on who plays in place of Neymar that could ultimately determine the outcome of the match.\n\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\n\nBrazil is well known as a side that loves to play on the front foot, put pressure on their opponent, and use creative play in the final third to break down even the best defense, but with their superstar sidelined, it may be best to choose a more defensive minded side. Bringing on Willian or Bernard would provide just that. Even though each of those players is an attacking threat, they both have the ability to track back and defend which J\u00f4 would not. Another benefit to using a midfielder is that it leaves an attacker on the bench as a possible sub in the event that the Brazilians fall behind. As for the matchup with the Germans, it actually sets up pretty well for Brazil. Teams that have played at a high pace have given Germany problems thus far.\n\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\n\nObviously Brazil cannot play at the same pace without Neymar, but they still should be able to bang the ball around the midfield quickly and then release down the flanks. Fernandinho, Oscar and Paulinho should be able to control the ball through the center, and it's possible that without the Neymar-centric focus they've had, it may allow Hulk and Fred more opportunities. As long as the defense can hold it's shape they should be able to slow down the German attack that still doesn't look completely comfortable with the false-nine or Miroslav Klose leading the attack. It's possible the loss of Neymar completely derails Brazil, but it's also very possible they ban together and play an even more inspired game. Plus, there's still that stat that says the Brazilians simply don't lose in Brazil (last loss in 1975) and European sides still can't seem to get it right against South Americans in this World Cup.\n\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review\nDavid Luiz Crying 7-1 Germany vs Brazil 2014 FIFA World Cup Post Match Interview Review", "title": "Allen Iverson's Cousin has NBA POTENTIAL Kuran Iverson has HANDLES and VISION", "publishedDate": "2014-07-09T21:34:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Y1-tgqGQ-E", "description": "Super shaky for a number of reasons:\n1.

There is a Minor Pentatonic Scale (which I'll show you first), and there is a Major Pentatonic Scale. You may ask why you should use a scale with such a small amount of notes. The reason is that Pentatonic Scales provide a small margin for error when you are playing over a chord progression of the chords that go with the scale. Another reason to use the scale is if you are looking to find that rock sound. Jimi Hendrix used this scale more than any other. Now, it is hard to find a rock song without pentatonics in it. B.B. King, Clapton and many others also use the Pentatonic Scale. They use the Minor Pentatonic scale for its bluesy quality. \n\nThis scale is a fairly simple introduction to scales and how scales work. It is a very commonly used scale and can be found in many popular songs, especially in classic rock, blues, hard rock, and more. Because this scale is so commonly used it is the perfect scale for you to start with.\n\nAll of these positions fit together perfectly and will always be in the same order that they are here. That means that they must always be positioned together as they are and their relation to each other will never change. To play this pentatonic minor scale in any key other than A, you would have to slide the whole note diagram up or down the neck, moving all the positions together.\nThe Pentatonic differs from many \"traditional\" scales, which often have seven (or more) notes. The fewer number of notes in the pentatonic scale can be helpful to the beginner guitarist - the scale omits some of the \"trouble\" notes found in traditional major and minor scales that can end up sounding wrong if not used properly.\n\nAs always start slowly and give yourself time to learn these shapes, try to find a daily practice routine because this helps more than any other advice you can get when learning such an awesome instrument as the guitar is.  \nSee you in the next lesson. :)\n\nHere's my Facebook site in chase you want to leave a friendly message.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/VIP-Guitar/129754850420739\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/HorstKeller\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/VIPGuitarPros", "title": "Pentatonic Guitar Lesson: \"Connecting the 5 Scale Shapes\" - Easy Lesson", "publishedDate": "2012-05-12T16:01:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Y4lwpVcyBg", "description": "Renault Clio am Slalom Interlaken 3.

The performance at St. Peter's Basilica was seen as a historic event that reflected increasing unity between the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Anglican Westminster choir is perhaps the most illustrious of its kind. Last year, it performed at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nIn 2010, it performed during Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the abbey, and it was the pope himself who was behind the decision to invite the choirboys to Rome. The pope also specified that he wanted the Anglican choir to unite with his personal Sistine Chapel Choir, rather than alternating performances.\n\nToday is the first time the pope's 500-year-old choir has allowed any other group to sing with it, let alone one from the breakaway Anglican Church. Anglicans split from Rome in 1534 and historically have maintained their distance.\n\nHowever, as today's performance indicates, Pope Benedict is trying to bring Anglicans back where he thinks they belong: Rome. It is interesting to note the purpose of this special papal mass is to grant newly appointed Catholic archbishops a woolen stole, a symbol of their communion with the pope.\n\nThe symbolism, location and overtones of today's mass are an indicator of what is coming. The Trumpet has forecast for decades that the Roman Catholic Church will bring its Protestant daughter churches back under the authority of the pope.\n\nPope Benedict has already taken major steps to coax conservative Anglicans back to Catholicism and will continue to do so. Watch for more signals that the Anglican Church and other Protestant churches are reuniting with Rome. To understand more, read our article \"The Church That Swallowed a Church\" on www.theTrumpet.com", "title": "Anglican, Vatican Choirs Unite for Papal Mass", "publishedDate": "2012-06-29T16:59:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "2Y9QVdudDFM", "description": "Download this song on iTunes here!

Best friend to Female 4, daughter of the emperor, her loyalties are tested when Female 4's allegiance to begins to wane towards the Resistance.\n\n[ MALE 5 ]\nRace: Asian, becomes a Cyborg Country of origin: unknown Allegiance: neutral Voice: low, powerful, slight accent Age: 30s Male 5 is possibly the most ruthless of the secretive assassins. A technology enthusiast, he volunteered to be the first to undergo transformation to a cyborg. His enhanced skills and hard-hearted nature make him the perfect killing machine. He now searches for rogue clan members in order to bring them back to for cyber-conversion.\n\n[ MALE 8 ]\nRace: Native American (possibly Lakota Sioux) Allegiance: hero Age: 30s-40s Voice: Smooth, low, calm Male 8 is a great Native American shaman and thus is intimately connected to the spirit world. These powers, in combination wih his superior fighting skills, make him a most trusted ally, and one of the most formidable protectors of Earth.\n\n[ MALE 9 ]\nRace: African-American Allegiance: neutral, becomes a villain Age: 20s Male 9 is a member of the secretive ninja assassins' guild. As such, he's loyal to whoever pays him. Unlike his fellow members, however, there are certain lines he won't cross.

He fought for the right to represent Earthrealm in the Mortal Kombat tournament but lost to his friend and rival. Younger and less experienced than his counterpart, his skill is unquestioned. He just needs to learn how to keep his emotions and impulsiveness in check.\n\n[ MALE 13 ]\nRace: African-American Allegiance: U.S. Special Forces (hero) Age: 30s Male 13 is the commander of a secret Special Forces unit. While pursuing a black-market arms dealer, he and his subordinate are forced to participate in the Mortal Kombat tournament.
