Garage bands blasted off with guitar music, and legions of musicians who couldn't swing pro gear bashed away on department-store guitars and amps.  The Vaporizer amp blasts you like a ray gun back to that exciting era. Affordable and out of this world, it would've been right at home aboard a Mercury capsule and down in the backyard fallout shelter. It would've been stumbled on decades later in some pawn shop corner by an unconventional guitarist with an ear for the distinctive and an eye for the stylish. It's the Fender Vaporizer.

My brain manufactures the worst possible scenarios all the time and I react to it as if it's real. I don't think I would have been able to stifle that without sobriety.

Shaw said his nephew did not know how to swim.\n\n[+] EnlargeShaw\nKirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports\nUSC says it has received a few phone calls contradicting a story from cornerback Josh Shaw, who said he sprained his ankles jumping from the second story of an apartment to save his nephew in a pool.\n\"Josh Shaw, first and foremost, is a good person and a good kid,\" Sarkisian said after Tuesday's practice. \"He came to us with what had occurred Saturday night, and I have no reason and no history to not believe Josh and his story and what has occurred. Within the last few hours or so, we've gotten a few phone calls contradicting what Josh said occurred Saturday night, so we're going to continue to vet. We're looking at it. Beyond that, I only know what I know. Josh is adamant with what occurred, and we'll continue to vet some of the other stories that have come across our desk and our phones and see where we can go from there.\"\n\nWhen Sarkisian was asked who had called and made him second-guess Shaw's story, he said, \"I don't want to get into who's calling us. I'd just appreciate it if you guys gave us some time to vet it and look into it so that we can give you a real solid answer instead of more hearsay and what might have or what might not have occurred.\"\n\nMultiple sources told ESPNLA.com that school officials were skeptical of Shaw's story before releasing a statement about it along with quotes from Shaw and Sarkisian on Monday. Their skepticism grew larger by Tuesday as the story gained steam and multiple media outlets wanted to talk to Shaw, the 7-year-old nephew he rescued and family members who were at the party.\n\nLt. Andy Neiman of the Los Angeles Police Department also said Tuesday afternoon that a man named Joshua Shaw was mentioned -- but not as a suspect -- in a report involving a Saturday night break-in at a downtown apartment building.\n\nSarkisian huddled with school officials before addressing the media Tuesday and took only football questions for the first five minutes before addressing Shaw.\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" Sarkisian said when asked about the contradictory phone calls he received. \"I get calls on a lot of different things. We have to do our due diligence and vet everything, and we'll handle it internally. We'll see what happens with this one and move forward and give you guys an update.\"\n\nShaw was not available to the media, nor will he be until USC officials find out exactly what happened, Sarkisian said.\n\n\"Josh won't be available until we find out,\" Sarkisian said. \"I just don't want to put him in a situation of answering questions that we really don't have all the answers to.\"\n\nThe one aspect of Shaw's injury Sarkisian could confirm was that the cornerback did suffer two high ankle sprains and would be out indefinitely.\n\n\"I will say the X-rays and MRIs we have taken on him have come back negative,\" Sarksian said. \"So far we don't see anything structurally wrong with him but he is very sore.\"\n\nSarkisian said he wanted to put the situation behind him but wanted to get all the facts straight first.\n\n\"I think it's important to know your team,\" Sarkisian said. \"I think it's important to know your players. Josh Shaw has been a good leader for us. He's given me no reason to not believe what's occurred but you need to know.\"\n\nA transfer from Florida, Shaw has six interceptions in two seasons at USC.

These are the incisor (cutting), the canine, the premolar, and the molar (grinding). Mammals that have distinct types of teeth are heterodont; others are homodont.\nThe number of teeth of each type is written as a dental formula for one side of the mouth, with the upper and lower teeth shown on separate rows. The number of teeth in a mouth is twice that listed as there are two sides. In each set, incisors are indicated first, canines second, premolars third, and finally molars. For example, the formula 2.1.2.3 for upper teeth indicates 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars on one side of the upper mouth.\nThe dentition can be expressed as a dental formula. Teeth are numbered starting at 1 in each group, except the premolars which end at 4. Thus the human teeth are I1, I2, C1, P3, P4, M1, M2, and M3. The human dental formula is:  \nOf cats it is:  \nThe last upper premolar and first lower molar of the cat, since it is a carnivore, are called carnassials and are used to slice meat and skin. This means that the carnassials are always the fourth upper premolar and the first lower molar. The armadillo has a dental formula that is  .\nThe maximum dental formula for placental mammals is:  \nNon-placental mammals such as marsupials can have more teeth than placentals. The opossum's dental formula is:  \nIn many mammals the infants have a set of teeth that fall out and are replaced by adult teeth. These are called deciduous teeth, primary teeth, baby teeth or milk teeth. Animals that have two sets of teeth, one followed by the other, are said to be diphyodont. Normally the formula for milk teeth is the same as for adult teeth except that the molars are missing.\nThe milk tooth formula for humans is:  2.1.2/2.1.2\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Human Dentition", "publishedDate": "2010-05-04T10:02:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ybuqRYV_B4", "description": "A group of wild dwarf mongooses in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa", "title": "Wild dwarf mongooses!", "publishedDate": "2012-02-29T16:20:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ybvjBbqJkw", "description": "Jonny Moseley shows us his favorite trail in Squaw Valley, CA", "title": "Trails We Love: Squaw Valley", "publishedDate": "2013-01-24T15:38:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ybzCTvXkso", "description": "Common Waxbill\nSpain 2007", "title": "Common Waxbill", "publishedDate": "2010-05-26T17:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4yc71ANn0lo", "description": "Hoppade bana och avsluta med en linje p\u00e5 105 + 1m.\nGick kanon banan, men linjen fick kom vi fel hela tiden och hoppa alldelles f\u00f6r stort! \nHoppar g\u00f6r han ju iaf, duktige killen.", "title": "Hopplektion Calito 120620", "publishedDate": "2012-06-22T07:32:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ycEx4YXZiQ", "description": "I do not own anything.

So, those serratus muscles there's a couple of them. The serratus anterior muscles are right here. They're underneath your shoulder blades and they interconnect with with your external oblique abdominal muscles.\n\nSo, it's very important that we strengthen the serratus muscles to help the support and function of the external obliques.\n\nNow flex your toes into the mat and extend one leg at a time back behind you with the heels together, the toes apart. Then lower the hips and slightly tuck the tailbone.\n\nFrom here inhale. Lower your chest toward the mat. Hugging the shoulder blades together. Then exhale. Lift the chest back up. Inhale.

It is bad that your skin could get infected with acne but it is even worse if it is cystic or acute acne. However, you need not worry; a cystic acne home remedy treatment will offer you the cure for your condition after all.\n\nThe particular cause of cystic forms of acne might not be known but there are a number of reasons why you could be suffering from it. Some of these include hereditary reasons, hormonal imbalances, some forms of medication, stress and even the diet your body feeds on. Other causes may include using certain oily cosmetics, using rough cleansing agents that are not easy on the skin, dust and even pollution. In most cases, a person with a skin that has overactive sebaceous glands and plenty of dead skin cells will suffer from cystic acne. Adults suffering from cystic acne might in most cases have gotten it either through hormonal imbalances or hereditary ways. Whatever the cause of your cystic forms of acne, a cystic acne home remedy is guaranteed to offer redemption.\n\nIn an attempt to get rid of cystic acne, obviously many alternatives will be tried and since the condition might keep worsening, one might start to feel dejected and hopeless. The simple truth is that a cystic acne home remedy is a fast, safe and sure way to get rid of cystic forms of acne. If not because it is cheap and easily accessible, the home remedy is advantageous because it is actually proven to work and will offer great relief as well as relaxation to a person suffering from cystic acne. In a nutshell, they are simple procedures one will perform within the safe confines of their home without having to spend a lot of time and resources looking for a cure elsewhere.\n\nOne way to get rid of cystic forms of acne is by using baking soda. Mix half a teaspoon of baking soda with water and make a paste then apply it to the affected area. After about 15 minutes, rinse it off with cool water. You will have results sooner than you think. Another option could be the use of potatoes. These potatoes have in them alkaline which break down the oils in the skin pores. Simply slice a raw potato to half and then rub the juice on the affected part then leave it on for half an hour and rinse off with warm water. Another cystic acne home remedy that will provide results is crushing 2 to 3 aspirin tablets and mixing a tablespoon of honey to make a paste. Apply on the affected area and after 20 minutes, rinse with lukewarm water.\n\nThe frequency with which purported solutions to acne are discovered is such that every day there is new medicine in the market that claims to cure cystic acne. However the cystic acne home remedy has been proven to stand the test of time and provide healing and blemish free skin to millions of individuals in the world today.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/Acne-Tips-Tricks-And-Secrets\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ylNH9MBX0I", "title": "Cystic Acne Home Remedy", "publishedDate": "2014-01-01T11:52:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ylP7fb8z4Q", "description": "Bow Wow impersonates 50 Cent, Lil Wayne and T.I. to perform the \"Exclusive Hit\" \"Cops Be Working With Thugs\"\n\nWild 'N Out airs Wednesdays at 11/10c on MTV2\n\nWatch Full Episodes of Wild \u2018N Out: goo.gl/k3yccZ\n\nWild 'N Out is your home for freestyle comedy.

Most people think that once their vision starts to deteriorate then only the optician or oculist will be able to restore it. At the end of this article I'll tell you how you can dispense with their services forever. Of course, in recent years, the development of lasik-laser eye surgery has provided a different option but many of us are reluctant to submit our valuable - no, irreplaceable - eyes to a cutting laser beam (it conjures up visions of James Bond coming very close to being emasculated in Goldfinger). Furthermore, laser surgery is expensive and, although it has a good track record it's not infallible and things do go wrong from time to time.\n\nThe solution, of course, is to adopt a regime of eye exercises and other techniques to improve the flexibility of our the lenses in our eyes both to improve their resolving power and their ability to switch between different focal lengths. The original idea was developed and promoted by W.H. Bates in 1920. The original book was greeted with some skepticism by the establishment of the day and many attempts to discredit it were made. This may be because it contains certain techniques that, today, we would regard as downright dangerous, such as focusing sunlight on the eyes with a lens. This should never be attempted under any circumstances. One can only speculate on what happened to the hapless people who actually did try it at the time.\n\nBut the basic ideas have persisted and have since been enhanced and developed into a much safer and more effective approach than Bates was ever able to do, nearly 100 years ago. There is still a deal of skepticism about this technique, possibly because it doesn't work for everybody. And this may be because it does actually take some time. It's not a quick fix so anyone who's likely to just try it for a week or two and then give up is not really giving it a fair chance. To improve eyesight naturally will take time. If you do have the commitment to stick with it for a while then you may well find that you can throw those glasses away and look forward to a life of clear vision and no facial encumbrances.\n\nimprove your vision without glasses or contact lenses\nvision without glasses download\nglasses to improve vision\nperfect vision without glasses\nperfect vision glasses\nvision without glasses reviews\nhow to improve my vision without glasses\ndownload vision without glasses\ndo glasses improve vision\ni have perfect vision but i want glasses\nglasses for vision\nwhat is vision without glasses\nvision with glasses\ni want glasses but i have perfect vision\nways to improve eyesight\nways to improve vision\nnatural ways to improve eyesight", "title": "Can You Really Improve Eyesight Naturally?", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T17:26:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ymEKqpZOYI", "description": "een Liefdes Lied  tussen een  man  en  een  vrouw", "title": "Melvin Stoffel ft.

It is also known by the other names such as Blue Mormon, Lemon Pansy or Bharangi. The flowers are white, purple or blue, butterfly shaped (pterygoid) with glittering blue stamens and style standing out in a smooth curve. Branchlets are densely yellow pubescent especially on nodes when young, becoming dark brown to gray-yellow and glabrous. Leaves opposite or in threes; petiole to 5 cm or leaf sub sessile; leaf blade oblong, obovate-oblong, elliptic, or ovate, 6-30 2.5-11 cm, papery, pubescent, margin sub entire to serrulate or sparsely coarse serrate, apex acuminate to acute; veins 10 or 11 pairs, abaxially prominent. Inflorescences are terminal thyrsus, densely yellow-brown hairy. Bracts are sessile, ovate to broadly ovate, 1.5-4.5 0.5-1.8 cm. Flowers white, bluish, or purplish, tube 7 mm. Petals oblong to obovate, 6-12 mm. Stamens 2-4 cm long, protruding out. The Style is long protruding and its Drupes are green when young, becoming black, spherical. It is used as a common herb for treating common cold, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, cough and other chronic respiratory problems. It is also used by Ayurveda for relief from fever and hyper-pyrexia. Bharangi has been investigated for its antipyretic and antihistamine activities.\n\nKas/Kaas Plateau is a lateritic soil plateau on the ridge of North Western Ghats of India located to the west of Satara, Maharashtra. Kas plateau has only a shallow upper layer soil in scattered depressions and composed of exposed porous soft rock. The plateau is filled with small rivulets and ponds. The origin of its name 'Kaas' is still unclear yet this was once home to 'kaasa' plants Elaeocarpus. Probably the place got its name from the 'Kaasa' plant. Kas Plateau is recently recognised by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site.  The flora on Kas plateau consists of herbaceous plants many of them being ephemerals dotted with clumps of shrubs, memecylon being the dominant species. The floral extravaganza at Kas begins with the advent of North West monsoon. The spectacle of Kas flowers has been unfolding each year after surviving through annual grazing and burning, yet Kas is threatened by the insurgence of thousands of visitors thronging the plateau on peak flowering days.\n\nSatara is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India. The town is 2320 ft. above sea-level, near the confluence of the Krishna and its tributary river Venna. The city was the capital of the Maratha empire in the 17th century, hence one of the historical cities of Maharashtra. This city is the capital of Satara Tehsil, as well as Satara District.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

It is native to forests in mountainous areas of western China.\n\nThe adult male is 90--105 cm in length, its tail accounting for two-thirds of the total length.\n\nMales have a golden-yellow crest with a hint of red at the tip. The face, throat,chin, and the sides of neck are rusty tan. The wattles and orbital skin are both yellow in colour, and the ruff or cape is light orange. The upper back is green and the rest of the back and rump is golden-yellow. The tertiaries are blue whereas the scapulars are dark red. Other characteristics of the male plumage are the central tail feathers, black spotted with cinnamon, as well as the tip of the tail being a cinnamon buff. The upper tail coverts are the same colour as the central tail feathers. The male also has a scarlet breast, and scarlet and light chestnut flanks and underparts. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow.\n\nThe female (hen) is much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage similar to that of the female Common Pheasant. She is darker and more slender than the hen of that species, with a proportionately longer tail (half her 60--80 cm length). The female's breast and sides are barred buff and blackish brown, and the abdomen is plain buff. She has a buff face and throat. Some abnormal females may later in their lifetime get some male plumage. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow.\n\nBoth males and females have yellow legs and yellow bills.\n\nGolden Pheasant Breeding farm buy Golden Pheasant show quality Golden Pheasants where can i buy Golden Pheasant in India USA UK Canada and China.\n\nMusic Credit : Silver Shine Music by Dan-O at DanoSongs.com", "title": "The Golden Pheasant Chinese Pheasant Game Bird male and Female Video", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T21:14:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4yvHIeJjXIU", "description": "Ornella acompa\u00f1a a su hija Tiziana a su clase de gimnasia art\u00edstica.", "title": "Gimnasia Art\u00edstica: Budding Gym", "publishedDate": "2011-01-27T21:15:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4yvHjUJvhI4", "description": "", "title": "Star Crossed 1x12 Promo HD  This Trick May Chance to Scathe You", "publishedDate": "2014-05-24T14:43:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4yvRedx67bQ", "description": "Buzz is a smalltooth sawfish, (Pristis pectinata) a critically endangered member of the elasmobranch (sharks and rays) family.

Dec. 2011 - 05. Apr. 2012\n\nThe Master-Thesis 'Biomimetic inspired Robot Design with Walking and Rolling locomotion' deals with implementing a locomotion behavior observed in the biological archetype Cebrennus villosus to a robot prototype whose structural design needs to be developed.\n\nThe biological sample is investigated as far as possible and compared to other evolutional solutions within the framework of nature's inventions. Current achievements in robotics are examined and evaluated for their relation and relevance to the robot prototype in question. An overview of what is state of the art in actuation ensures the choice of the hardware available and most suitable for this thesis. Through a constant consideration of the achievement of two fundamentally different ways of locomotion with one and the same structure, a robot design is developed and constructed taking hardware constraints into account. The development of a special leg structure that needs to resemble and replace body elements of the biological archetype is a special challenge to be dealt with. Programming is a basic necessity to judge the performance of the robot. Finally a robot prototype was achieved, which is able to walk and roll - inspired by the spider Cebrennus villosus. Yet the necessity of implementing sensors to the structure becomes obvious and is a matter of further research and development.", "title": "Quadruped with walking and rolling locomotion [BiLBIQ 02 - V 03 - following the robot]", "publishedDate": "2012-04-30T19:04:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4z0H1wyEUvY", "description": "This video introduces our latest digital signage products:\nSpinetiX HMP players, Fusion and Elementi\n\n\nVideo script:\nI'm George Preston from SpinetiX and today I'm giving a short overview of our products, and how they will help you make the right impression in front of your customers.\n\nSpinetiX offers a complete signage solution including both hardware and software.

Carlin and his \"Seven dirty words\" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5--4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves. One newspaper called Carlin \"the dean of counterculture comedians.\"\n\nThe first of his 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. In 2004, Carlin was placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor.\n\nHe was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.", "title": "GEORGE CARLIN - 1966 - \"The Hippy Dippy Weatherman\"", "publishedDate": "2014-05-05T03:21:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4z33elRL9Tw", "description": "Chyna Park (China Anne McClain) sings a special version of \"Exceptional\", also known as the theme song of A.N.T.

Perspiration is regulated by the Sympathetic Nervous System, which controls about five million sweat glands in the body. Sweating is controlled by branches of the sympathetic chain that is located within the chest cavity.Hyperhydrosis is a medical condition that causes perspiration far greater than the physiological needs of the body. Although no one knows why some individuals sweat excessively, it is known that the sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Excessive sweating may be episodic or continuous.\n\nYou are about to go on a job interview, to church, or to meet someone new and you notice that your hands and underarms are sweating. Or, you've just completed an aerobic workout and your whole body is soaked in sweat. Your body (Sympathetic Nervous System) naturally secretes sweat to cool down the body. But, in some cases, up to 1% of the population has excessive sweating where the body (Sympathetic Nervous System) overworks to cool down the internal body temperature. The condition is known as hyperhidrosis.\n\nLocations of hyperhidrosis\nHyperhidrosis can occur suddenly or continuously, in the four major areas: hands (palmer hyperhidrosis), armpits (axillary hyperhidrosis), feet (plantar hyperhidrosis), and face (facial hyperhidrosis). \npalmar hyperhidrosis | axillary hyperhidrosis | plantar hyperhidrosis | \nSymptoms of hyperhidrosis\n\nHaving palmer hyperhidrosis, axillary hyperhidrosis, plantar hyperhidrosis, and/or facial hyperhidosis is a profound and dramatic experience. It affects all aspects of life, including work and related professional activities, the activities of daily living and normal, interpersonal social actions.\n\nSweaty hands can occur while meeting someone for the first time, through nervousness or emotional distress. Even rubbing on a small amount of lotion can trigger palmar hyperhidrosis.\n\nIn severe palmer hyperhidrosis cases, sweat is seen to drip literally down from the hands. This is a condition which can be detected in early childhood. Patients with palmar hyperhidrosis disorder are constantly aware of their condition and think they have to live with it. Usually, the sweating of the hands is the most distressing manifestation of primary hyperhidrosis. The amount of sweating varies from moisture to actual dripping. Many patients report, also, that their hands feel cold and clammy.\n\nBecause hands are exposed in social and professional settings, many patients with Hyperhidrosis are self-conscious and may avoid social contact. They may be reluctant to shake hands or handle paperwork. Patients have even been embarrassed to hold the hands of those they love.\n\nAxillary Hyperhidrosis , excessive sweating in the armpits, can cause embarrassing wet marks on shirts. People with this condition avoid many colors and fabrics which could show the sweat marks.\n\nPlantar Hyperhidrosis refers to excessive sweating of the feet. It is a known cause of foot odor and athlete's feet. The combination of palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis can create a problem for a driver because the moisture of the hands and feet can build up to make the steering wheel and foot pedals slippery; this, in turn, can cause a lack of control of the vehicle.\n\nFacial Hyperhidrosis, sweating of the face, may be so profuse that it causes the person to be insecure, appearing overly-anxious, when this is not really the case. Along with facial sweating, someone could experience facial blushing, another embarrassing manifestation of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", "title": "How to Cure Sweaty Hyperhidrosis", "publishedDate": "2013-10-03T18:29:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zE4S-7QbVg", "description": "The 36th segment for my speedrun of Baten Kaitos Origins.\n\nI thought this would be a break segment...as there seemed to be nothing too difficult about it.\n\nHowever, the enemies in this segment are as annoying as can be. Fun Fact: At least on the first two screens, I've lost a run to every single enemy (besides the flamethrower guys that don't move). This is probably the first time where I need to manipulate every single enemy I encounter, instead of just a few.\n\n1. First bloodleaf must not stop while flying past first time, must also stop some time before I return or it will be in the way.\n2. First Unuk must not be blocking my path either of the two times. But since it is in such a small area it usually does.\nI'd get past screen one maybe once every ten or fifteen minutes.\n3. Next blood leaf must not stop while I'm behind it.\n4. Next Unuk must not block my path, though it usually doesn't.\n5. Next blood leaf must not block the crane bridge.\n6. Next Unuk...okay, screw this Unuk. It ruined almost every run that got this far. It is enclosed in way too small an area, and there is only a small zone it can be in where it won't either see you too early for you to slip by, or just simply stand there and block your path.\n7. Unuk on the next screen can also screw you over.\nBasically, enemy manipulation was hard.\n\nSome other notes:\n- I move up one quest magnus halfway through the first screen since I don't have enough time to do it behind the enemy on the second. Since I also have to wait for my heartwing to cool down, it is better to do it now then later.\n- I wait for the waterfall because if I jumped in it, I would get teleported down, but I'd have to watch a short cutscene of near the same length as waiting. It would probably save about a second, but then two MORE enemies come into play that I have to manipulate.

Demand for care vastly exceeds supply of equipment and professionals.\n\nWe specially calibrate iPads for use as audiometers and use clinical audiometric headphones to administer valid tests. We have developed innovative games that enable the player to accurately test their own hearing. The user just plays the game and based on how they play we are able to obtain precise hearing thresholds across all sound frequencies for each ear. \n\nView 2014 Award Winners at this URL: http://www.cata.ca/Media_and_Events/Press_Releases/cata_pr05231401.html", "title": "Clearwater Clinical -- Shoebox Audiometer: TELUS Award for mHealth Innovation Winner", "publishedDate": "2014-06-05T22:04:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zLTmQa6qyU", "description": "Descripci\u00f3n del proceso para realizar la l\u00e1mina 4 de chapa", "title": "INVENTOR TA3 lamina 4", "publishedDate": "2013-05-17T08:29:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zLsaOgbqXc", "description": "How to Prune Petunias with more info on pruning at http://www.youtube.com/user/headgardener2u/ \n from garden author Doug Green  Pruning plants such as petunias is a simple chore if you understand the nature of both pruning and petunias.\n\nThe objective is to create a heading cut that stops a branch of the petunia from growing and forces the plant to become bushier - thus producing more flowers  This video at http://www.douggreensgarden.com/pruning.html shows the two basic pruning cuts you use on all plants, from container plants to trees and shrubs such as hydrangea.  This page has info on pruning tomatoes as well.\n\nOnce you understand the effect pruning has on a plant, then you get to look at individual plants.\n\nThe problem associated with petunias is those darn big flowers. :-)  People often think when they remove the spent flower, they are pruning the plant.  This is not the case, removing spent flowers is called deadheading and not pruning.\n\nTo make a heading cut on a petunia, it is necessary to avoid the flower and big leaves but look at the very end of the shoot for the growing tip (the flower stem is behind this).  Leave the flowe or bud alone and carefullly pinch out the growing leaves just ahead of the flower stem.  Removing the growing tip will force new growth to come from further down the stem and the more new growth - the more flowers.\n\nThis kind of pruning is quite common in many garden plants, the difference is that you have to look quite closely at the petunia to differentiate between the flower and the growing point.\n\nYou can find me at G+ here  https://plus.google.com/u/0/107836847806083557330/posts \nFacebook is here  https://www.facebook.com/DougGreensGardening\nTwitter is here https://twitter.com/douggreen", "title": "Pruning Plants: Petunias", "publishedDate": "2008-07-23T20:11:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zLytghD4AM", "description": "Venereal Sickness mandando a fudida Day of  Surffering do Morbid Angel no Night of Shadows em Carangola, 08/01/11.", "title": "Venereal Sickness - Night of Shadows Carangola", "publishedDate": "2011-01-10T01:10:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zM1rhb-UDM", "description": "Courtesy: Lifenews\n\nCEO of French oil and gas company Total Christophe de Margerie died in a business jet crash at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Monday evening.

Some Google engineers are already doing this every day.   \n\nNo need to look for a parking space; just let the car find one for you as you enter the building.\n\nTwo computers tucked into the trunk are doing all the steering, braking and acceleration by issuing commands to the drive-by-wire bus already designed into modern hybrid and electric cars.\n\nThe spinning LIDAR on the room maps the environment in 3D, including pedestrians and, in this case, traffic cones.  A camera to the side of the rear view mirror tracks the road.  Three radar in the front bumper and one in back also detect proximal objects.   GPS, inertial sensors and wheel-speed monitors give feedback to the computer on the car's performance.\n\nThere are times when I want to drive, and times when being a driving machine feels more like the drudgery that is better left to the machines.   Or when you are tired, or want a designated driver for an evening out.  Commute time is a staggering collective time waster, and Ford estimates it will escalate to global gridlock in the near future.

Features such as short stature, Prognathic face with procumbent teeth, meaning with a flat or  forward projecting face, with a high vault, and wide interorbital distance, gives credence to the Asian origin.  \n\n\nGeneral: Although some damage is present, this human skull is an excellent robust male specimen. It appears to have once been articulated to a complete skeleton set as indicated by a filled hole in the top of the skull. It has been well handled since its early preparation as indicated by an overall consistent patina resulting from natural oils in the skin transferred by handling. This effect makes this skull somewhat darker overall in the tone. \n\n\nIn terms of obvious damage, many teeth are missing and/or damaged post mortem. The mandible appears to have been repaired after a complete breakage at the chin. The right side viewing parietal is missing a large piece. It appears that the piece was broken and repaired but eventually re-damaged and never repaired a second time. \n\n\nThe plates in the skull are very tight & solid along the sutures. There is no play or looseness among the sutures in the skull. No other sutures on the skull itself are loose, even the Squamous Suture at the temporal bone (on the side of the skull) is tight. Both Zygomatic processes are completely missing, probably due to handling. \n\n\nAnomaly: Ante-mortem nose trauma.   There appears to be ante-mortem trauma to the nose as the upper nasal is missing bone and the perpendicular plate exhibits a healed and incorrectly set fracture although it is 100% intact. The ethmoid bone structure is 100% complete consisting of Inferior and Middle Nasal Concha.\n\n\nDetention: There are 10 teeth total, some complete and some partial. \n \n\nConcerning the calvarium cut; It is attached to the skull at the split line by ONE post in the rear center and ONE post in the front center. The fit is solid and allows for a perfect sung fit between the upper & lower parts. There are no typical side latch-pin style attachments. All the plates are still very tight & solid along the sutures. The CUT is a little off however but there is no play or looseness among the sutures in the skull.  \n\n\nStainless Steel springs present as the mandible articulation hardware, allowing the jaw to open within the natural range of movement. The upper attachment of the springs to the skull slip over two pins, allowing the mandible to be easily removed for handling and individual study.  \n\n\nThe skull has no additional finish such as lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane. It is clean and exhibits only minor stain. There is no chalking, flaking, or peeling.\n\nInformation: TheAnatomyStore@gmail.com - Jeff Nix, 678-776-8861", "title": "Human Skull MD-14 Natural Bone  Large Male With Dental Anomaly", "publishedDate": "2008-12-02T06:12:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zWDaSdGN3U", "description": "http://www.dell.com/latitude  \nLearn what makes each Latitude unique and the best fit for your business needs.", "title": "Compare Dell Latitude 7000, 5000 and 3000 Business Laptops", "publishedDate": "2013-11-08T14:45:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zWFIE0TAg8", "description": "flathead and transmission  from a 1935 dodge coupe still running strong on a frame , is 4 sale in holland (the netherlands)", "title": "flathead 6 in line mopar", "publishedDate": "2010-06-06T15:13:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4zX1jUbdTIs", "description": "OFFICIAL DUDE YOUR CAR APP http://bit.ly/1oOWdFj\n10 SMART PHONE PRANKS http://bit.ly/ZDZmM4\nInstagram @DennisRoady\nLearn How to Prank here http://bit.ly/howtoPRANKitup\n\nANYBODY THAT HAS A FRIEND WITH A CAR CAN PULL THIS ONE OFF!! \n\nSHOCK THE WORLD SUBSCRIBE NOW\nNATURAL BORN PRANKSTERS\n\nShock the World here:\nFacebook /DennisRoady\nInstagram @DennisRoady\nTwitter @DennisRoady\n\nThanks so much for watching.

Ausl\u00f6sende \u00dcbelt\u00e4ter sind meist Viren, seltener auch Bakterien. Betroffene leiden unter einem hartn\u00e4ckigen Husten, der in der akuten Phase auch schmerzhaft sein kann.

In this video, the President shares his inspiration for signing the law, and how the Paycheck Fairness Act can help achieve equal pay for all workers. Go to https://my.barackobama.com/potusledbettervid and sign up to find out what you can do to help make this happen.\n\n\"The very first bill I signed into law as President was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act. It was a big step toward making sure every worker in this country, man or woman, receives equal pay for equal work. I signed this law for women like my mother a single mother who paid her way through college and made huge contributions to a work force that wasn't always fair to her.\n\nI signed this law for women like my grandmother who woke up every morning to take a bus to her job at the bank. She worked hard. She was good at what she did. But time and again she was passed over for some promotions because she was a woman. I signed this law because I want young women like my own daughters to have chances and opportunities that my mom and grandmother never could have dreamed of. Thanks to the relentless efforts like Lilly Ledbetter those opportunities are already in reach. And thanks to this law we're one step closer to fair pair for all Americans, but there's still more work to do. \n\nThat's why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act. To often women can't access the information they need to fight the pay discrimination. This legislation would change that. It would protect women who try to find out if their receiving equal pay and it would make it easier for them to take action if they're not. In 2010 a minority of Senators fought a vote on this bill, but women can't wait for equal pay. \n\nI won't stop fighting this inequality. Visit women.barackobama.com and sign up to help more change like this happen. Policies that help women are policies that help our families and our economy grow stronger. Whether we can continue that progress depends on you so please join us now.

An anime television series produced by White Fox was broadcast between April and June 2012. A second season titled Jormungand: Perfect Order aired from October to December 2012. The first season has been licensed by Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom and Dybex in France. Both seasons have been licensed by Funimation Entertainment in North America.\n\nThe series follows Koko Hekmatyar, a young arms dealer who sells weapons under HCLI, an international shipping corporation that secretly deals in the arms trade. As one of the company's unofficial weapon dealers, she secretly sells weapons in many countries while avoiding the local authorities and law enforcement agencies as most of her work is actually illegal under international law. Traveling with her is her team of bodyguards who are mostly composed of ex-military veterans. Her latest addition to her crew is Jonah, a seemingly emotionless child soldier who is skilled in combat yet ironically hates arms dealers. What follows is Koko and her crew's escapades around the world.\n\nAn anime animated by White Fox and produced by Geneon was announced on the 10th volume of the manga. The anime began airing on April 10, 2012 on Tokyo MX, Television Kanagawa, TV Aichi and KBS and on later dates on Sun TV, BS11 and AT-X. The show will also be seen online in Showtime, NicoNico, Bandai Channel and GyaO. A second season of the series was also announced and is slated to be released in October 2012. Known as Jormungand: Perfect Order, it began broadcast on Japanese TV on October 9, 2012. The two seasons aired on Japanese TV at 12:30 AM.\n\nThe first release of Jormungand on DVD and Blu-ray was on June 27, 2012 with the first two episodes, \"Gun Metal, Calico Road\" and \"Pulsar\" included. Subsequent releases followed with two episodes each on both Blu-rays and DVDs on July 25, August 29 and September 26 of 2012. The Perfect Order DVD/Blu-Rays was first released in Japan on December 21, 2012.\n\nShowgate handles licensing aspect of Jormungand outside Japan. A sneak preview of the anime was held on March 31 to April 1, 2012 at the Anime Contents Expo at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba.\n\nThe manga is published in North America by VIZ Media. In Japan, Jormungand is officially published by Shogakukan. In Taiwan, it is licensed and published by Taiwan Tohan.\n\nBoth the opening and ending themes will be produced by I've Sound. The opening song is \"Borderland\" by Mami Kawada, and the ending theme is \"Ambivalentidea\" by Nagi Yanagi. \"Borderland\" was released as a single on May 30, 2012, while \"Ambivalentidea\" was released as a single on June 6, 2012. Both songs were released as singles by the record label Geneon Universal Entertainment. For the second season, the opening is \"Under / Shaft\" by Maon Kurosaki, while the ending is \"Laterality\" (\u30e9\u30c6\u30e9\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3) by Nagi Yanagi.\n\nScott Green, writing for Ain't It Cool News, summed up the series as being enjoyable, but underachieving. Matthew Warner feels that the story in the fourth volume is more focused on the business of trading weapons, describing it as a nice change of pace for the story, but Warner was disappointed that the violence and \"dark, twisted plot points\" of earlier volumes in the series were not present. Erica Friedman, organiser of Yuricon, noted the yuri potential of Valmet, but declared the manga to be \"just a dumb manga that I really like\". Karen Maeda enjoyed the action shown in the sixth volume, regarding the panels as being easy to follow, and hoped that Jormungand would be produced as an anime.\n\nIn Japan, the manga's 9th Volume sold 41,712 copies in a week for a total of 42,337 in the 27th place out of 30. Jormungand's 11th Volume was in 10th place and had sold 70,593 copies. It later placed itself in the 20th place out of 30, selling 34,697 copies weekly for a total of 105,290.", "title": "Jormungand Perfect Order OST Soundtrack Sex With Hex", "publishedDate": "2013-03-30T21:35:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-5TZPC2Iuc", "description": "Bushnell's new 8mp trophy cam takes good video, but I would rate the photos as average.

The many different types of forest are generally classified according to location and climate.\nTropical rainforests \nYear-round high temperatures and abundant rainfall makes this a dense, lush forest. Tropical rainforests are found near the equator. They are vital storehouses of biodiversity on the planet, and yet face severe threat today, with much of their original extent depleted.\n\n\nSub-tropical forests \nThese are found to the sound and north of the tropical forests. The trees here are adapted to resist the summer drought.\n\n\nMediterranean forests \nThese forests are found to the south of the temperate regions around the coasts of the Mediterranean, California, Chile and Western Australia. The growing season is short and almost all trees are evergreen, but mixed hardwood and softwood.\n\n\nTemperate forests \nFound in such places as eastern North America, northeastern Asia, and western and Eastern Europe, temperate forests are a mix of deciduous and coniferous evergreen trees. Usually, the broad-leaved hardwood trees shed leaves annually. There are well-defined seasons with a distinct winter and sufficient rainfall.\n\n\nConiferous forests \nConiferous forests inhabit the cold, windy regions around the poles. There are both hardwoods and conifers found in this region. The conifers are evergreen and structurally adapted to withstand the long drought-like conditions of the long winters, whereas the hardwoods are deciduous.\n\n\nMontane forests \nThese are also known as cloud forests because they receive most of their precipitation from the mist or fog that comes up from the lowlands. Some of these montane woodlands and grasslands are found in high-elevation tropical, subtropical and temperate zones. \n\nPlants and animals in these forests are adapted to withstanding the cold, wet conditions and intense sunlight. Trees are mainly conifers.\n\n\nPlantation forests\nThere are around 140 million hectares of \u201cplantation forests\u201d in the world, accounting for around 7% of global forest cover. The productivity of planted forests, in terms of supplying a sustainable volume of timber and fiber, is usually greater than natural forests. Plantations produce around 40% of industrial wood. \n\nBoth the plantation area and contribution to world wood production are projected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.", "title": "Different types of Tropical rain Forests,Sub-tropical, Mediterranean ,Coniferous ,Temperate forests", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T07:56:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-CgZ54YtC0", "description": "Can tennis great Serena Williams recall her own career highlights?", "title": "Serena Williams Talks Career Tennis Stats with David Letterman", "publishedDate": "2014-08-22T07:30:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-CnMQdofzo", "description": "This week Quinny was in the gym with members of the Ireland team.

Over the last 100 years, hunting and forest destruction have reduced tiger populations from hundreds of thousands of animals to perhaps fewer than 2,500. Tigers are hunted as trophies, and also for body parts that are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

I remember the day, for some reason my Kindergarten class was having a Mexican meal and all the parents were there too. I looked at the refried beans and thought they looked like slop, but I think everybody had to have a little of everything on their plates. I was amazed by the flavor of the brown-mashed-potato-isk substance and got seconds. My grandmother noticed and for about a year there after, trying anything to increase my fiber (if you know what I mean), she made them on a weekly basis. I still love pinto beans today, so I knew I had to do a refried beans recipe.\n\nFind me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/SweetestVegan\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sweetestvegan\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/sweetestvegan/\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSweetestVegan\nBlog: http://thesweetestvegan.com/\n \nRefried Beans Recipe - Frijoles Refritos - Mexican, Spanish, Tex-Mex, Cinco de Mayo Food\n\nIngredients:\n1 pound, or 2 1/2 cups, Dry Pinto Beans\n8 cups water\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1 teaspoon salt + more to taste\n1 teaspoon liquid smoke\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 cup chopped onion\n1/4 cup pinto bean broth, from cooking process\n1 1/2 tablespoons agave nectar\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nDirections:\n\nRinse the pinto beans in a big bowl of water and then drain them. Take a moment to sort them, look through and remove small rocks, dirt, and ugly beans.\n\nIn a large pot, bring 8 cups water to a boil over high heat. Add pinto beans, black pepper, salt, and  liquid smoke to the pot and reduce heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and allow the pinto beans to cook for about 2 hours. Check back and stir occasionally. The beans are done with they are soft and the skin is beginning to break.\n\nRemove the beans from the heat. Drain the cooking water, broth, off the beans into a separate container and reserve for later. \n\nPlace a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and onions. Sautee the onions until they become translucent. Add in the drained beans and mash with potato masher as they cook. Add in pinto bean cooking broth if the beans become dry, cracked, or begin to burn before you finish mashing them. Beans should appear thick and creamy, neither dry and cracking or wet and sloppy. \n\nAdd in agave nectar, salt to taste and garlic powder. Mash and stir until the refried beans appear to be lumpy brown mashed potatoes. Then they are ready to serve.\n\nI suggest topping with a little vegan sour cream and a few cilantro leaves.\n\nAdapted from:\nSimply Recipes Refried Beans\nhttp://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/refried_beans/\n\nOther Refried Bean Recipe Videos\n\nNicko's Kitchen REFRIED BEANS - VIDEO RECIPE\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c_M3qbb0zs\n\nShow me the Curry Refried Beans - Mexican Cuisine\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzeWbX0VqGg\n\nHilah Cooking How To Cook Refried Beans\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l23l7Hb3r5c", "title": "Refried Beans for Cinco de Mayo - Frijoles Refritos - vegan/vegetarian", "publishedDate": "2012-05-03T00:02:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-PMd15OI8s", "description": "Pretty Basic Tutorial and can create some really cool effects!\n\nDownload for my stock footage.........http://www.mediafire.com/?8gyfb5gqm69m23b", "title": "After Effects: Selective Color Tutorial", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T03:44:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-PSkMb_W54", "description": "Directed by Stuart Fryer\nTo see my UK reel, have a gander at: http://www.generatorfilms.tv/generator/fryer.html\nTo see my US reel, have a look at: http://mortarinc.com/directors.php", "title": "HEADFUL OF ROCK TV Commercial", "publishedDate": "2011-07-20T19:35:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "5-PU1704248", "description": "www.sinuscentro.com.br - Edited microscopic surgery for the ressection of a tympanic glomus tumor.

The capital is Malacca City, which is 148km south east of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur. Although it was the location of one of the earliest Malay sultanates, the monarchy was abolished when the Portuguese conquered it in 1511. The Governor, rather than a Sultan, acts as the head of state now.\n\nThe site where the city of Malacca stands today was the center of Malaccan history. It was the capital of the Malacca Sultanate and was the centre of the Malay world in the 15th and the 16th century after the Malays moved over from Sumatra and was the most prosperous Entrep\u00f4t and city of the Malay Archipelago before it fell to the hand of Portuguese in 1511. Centuries of colonization by the Portuguese, Dutch and the British as well as development of Straits Chinese culture have influenced the architecture of the town, notably the Portuguese A Famosa, Dutch Stadthuys, and the Dutch, Chinese and British influenced traditional town houses.\n\nModern-day Malacca is a vibrant old city with a unique historical and cultural background from previous Portuguese, Dutch and British rule. The city centre was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in July 2008, along with Georgetown in Penang.\n\nThe tourism and manufacturing sectors are the two most important sectors in the state economy. Malacca has adopted as its slogan, \"Visiting Malacca Means Visiting Malaysia\". It is rich in cultural heritage and bears several places of historical interest.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nWe would like to hear from you!

Can we go ahead and get an MRI to see what the heck is going on? Do we have to waste time with all the other stuff?\u201d I\u2019ve heard this more than a few times. While occasionally going straight to an expensive test like an MRI is warranted, the vast majority of times it simply is not. Most people don\u2019t like to hear this, but it is indeed true.\n\nWhy is that? Very simple: Most people get better. The body has an amazing ability to heal itself. And especially when dealing with a non-smoker, anywhere between 80 and 90% of low back pain that does not have any red-flag symptoms as deemed by the physician, get better spontaneously.\n\nThe first step in evaluation is to make sure that there are no red flags. These red flags indicate that something very serious is going on and that we may have to do an aggressive evaluation. If we have fever, known infection in the spine, unexplained weight loss, bladder or bowel incontinence, known history of cancer, or active IV drug use, we need to be very aggressive about low back pain. We are talking about a patient that may have an abscess or infection of the bone, or cancer in their bones, and studies are needed.\n\nAlso, if we have somebody who has bilateral (both sides) leg neurological deficits, significant trauma, and very severe back pain especially at night, then we may have somebody who is starting to have true nerve damage, and they might warrant in selected cases a more aggressive evaluation.\n\nHowever, most patients who go to the doctor for low back pain don\u2019t fit these criteria. Most of them have nonspecific low back pain, and don\u2019t have these red flags. They usually need a stepwise approach to their back pain. They don\u2019t need x-rays, and x-rays should be done only if they fail to improve after 4 to 6 weeks in the absence of any red flags. They can be shown exercises at home, and can be sent to physical therapy if they fail to improve. An MRI can be done of the spine only if the back pain becomes chronic, or if they develop red-flag symptoms. An MRI on everyone who walks in the door is wasteful, and also shows many small problems of the spine which are not significant.\n\nElectromyograms and nerve conduction studies, which measure the integrity of the nerve and muscle function, can be done by a neurologist for those who we believe have nerve damage. However, in the absence of symptoms, getting one of these studies done subjects patients to needless pain, and will not tell us any new information.\n\nRarely, a CT myelogram, where dye is injected into the spinal cord area and the patient placed under a CT scan, is needed to better look at the discs that are in between the vertebrae of the back. However, the CT myelogram can be painful, and with the improved technology of MRIs, is rarely needed. A plain CT (without any dye) would only be needed if we think there\u2019s a serious problem with the actual bone. Plain CTs do not see the discs very well, and therefore have limited use in the evaluation of low back pain.\n\nTalk to your physician about how best to evaluate your low back pain.

It won't move it and it allows you to control the amount of coverage you want - meaning you get to keep the glow you want - hence the gorgeous hayden panettiere always has that glow without ever looking oily.

That, and the boys are obsessed with transportation!\nI must add that our boys had NO language just six months ago when we adopted them.  They have flourished with ASL as their first language.  The older boy on the left is deaf.  The younger boy on the right (with the loose seatbelt...thanks for pointing that out. Consider it fixed!) is mostly hearing/a little hard-of-hearing. \nI pray this inspires parents with deaf kids to sign with them!  Signing will NOT hinder their speech, but will vastly improve their ability to learn.  Signing gives them a way to express themselves and gives YOU a way to truly know them. \nBless all of you who have watched so far!

They first formed in 1990, releasing the More Than Ever demo tape in 1991. This was quickly followed in 1992 by a split EP with Crisis of Faith and the Life Goes On EP that same year. The band was soon renowned as one of the heaviest in hardcore, drawing ire from some purists for incorporating metal riffage into their sound. Their rise in popularity paralleled that of other vegan straight edge bands such as Earth Crisis and hardline bands like Vegan Reich and Raid. While bands that adhered to Hardline were totally opposed to abortion, Chokehold was vehemently pro-choice. While Chokehold were atheists and radicals with a strongly anarchist streak to their politics, many of the hardline bands were by contrast conservative (expressing belief in a higher power, homophobia, support for the death penalty and prisons and other conservative views).\nIn 1993 Chokehold released the Prison of Hope LP through American label Conquer the World Records (CTW). They released their next record, 1994s Instilled EP, on Philadelphia, PAs Bloodlink Records. This EP featured some of their most powerful and political material to date, notably the anti-religious song Anchor, the anti-homophobia song Mindset, and Burning Bridges, with its hard-hitting lyrics: The corporations are aware where the average person is not, violence against one meat eater is not going to liberate a million animals. You must take action against those who run the industry, not the ones lied to. And to take them down we must use as much fucking violence as they do. Animal liberation, Earth liberation, Human liberation, will only come through education.\nThey followed this in the next year with their second LP, Content With Dying. This album contained by far their most controversial song yet: Not a Solution was possibly the most militantly pro-choice hardcore song since Born Againsts Mary and Child. The liner notes to the song state, to all the militant pro-lifers who couldnt spell life let alone understand it, we salute you with a middle finger. The song is directed at those who identify as pro-lifers, including many vegan straight edge bands at the time, most notably Abnegation. This song in particularly created a huge rift in the vegan straight edge scene. When Chokehold played a show with Abnegation that year, the two bands spent their sets screaming at each other, and they and their fans nearly came to blows. This refusal to back down in the face of significant opposition even within their own subculture typifies Chokeholds uncompromising stance in general.\nThey signed in 1996 to Germanys Mad Mob Records, who unbeknownst to them already had a bad reputation in the European hardcore scene. They recorded four new songs to be released as a split CD with Feeding the Fire, but after a European tour in 1996 the band decided to break up. They played their last show in March at the New Bedford Fest in Massachusetts. These four songs were released as a self-titled EP on Jawk Records the following year. Members went on to play in such bands as The Swarm, Brutal Knights, Left For Dead, Haymaker, Our War and Seventy-Eight Days.\n\n\nAlbum : Content With Dying\n\nLyrics : Turn on your world sit back and relax all you need is an addiction at your own fingertips.

The correct composers are Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The confusion is probably due to the fact that this song is from a film that all three contributed songs to. Sorry about the clumsy start. This is an inside out record so I have to hold the on lever while it plays (because of the automatic shut-off). I only have 2 hands.

Some of the truffle species are highly prized as a food. French gourmand Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin called truffles \"the diamond of the kitchen\". Edible truffles are held in high esteem in Middle Eastern, French, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Georgian cooking, as well as in international . Truffles are ectomycorrhizal fungi and are therefore usually found in close association with the roots of trees.

Sie leben in S\u00fcdamerika und wurden fr\u00fcher wegen ihres Fells gejagt und fast ausgerottet. Heute sind sie als Pelz- und Heimtiere weltweit verbreitet, in freier Wildbahn hingegen stark gef\u00e4hrdet. Es werden zwei Arten unterschieden, das Langschwanz-Chinchilla und das Kurzschwanz-Chinchilla.\n\nAllgemeines:\n\nEigentliche Chinchillas erreichen eine Kopfrumpfl\u00e4nge von 22 bis 38 Zentimeter und eine Schwanzl\u00e4nge von 7,5 bis 15 Zentimetern. Weibchen sind schwerer und k\u00f6nnen 800 Gramm erreichen, w\u00e4hrend die kleineren M\u00e4nnchen nur rund 500 Gramm auf die Waage bringen. Sowohl Vorder- als auch Hinterpfoten enden in vier Zehen, die mit schwachen Krallen versehen sind. Das seidige Fell  ist sehr dicht und weich; es ist blaugrau oder br\u00e4unlich gef\u00e4rbt, der Bauch und die Innenseite der Pfoten sind wei\u00df. \u00dcblicherweise hat jedes Haar eine schwarze Spitze. Sie haben ein au\u00dferordentlich dichtes Fell \u2014 mit mehr als 20.000 Haaren pro cm\u00b2 z\u00e4hlt es zu den dichtesten aller Landbewohner. Die Haare selbst sind etwa 30x d\u00fcnner als Menschenhaar. Das Fell erh\u00e4lt seine besondere Dichte, da aus einer Haarwurzel bis zu 60 einzelne Wollhaare entspringen. Der buschige Schwanz ist an der Oberseite mit langen, rauen Haaren besetzt.\n\nDer Kopf ist breit, die Ohren sind gro\u00df und die Augen schwarz. Das Gebiss der Eigentlichen Chinchillas gleicht dem der \u00fcbrigen Meerschweinchenverwandten. Das bleibende Gebiss hat 20 Z\u00e4hne, die Zahnformel lautet I1/1-C0/0-P1/1-M3/3. Wie bei allen Nagetieren sind die Schneidez\u00e4hne als Nagez\u00e4hne ausgebildet und die Eckz\u00e4hne fehlen. Alle Z\u00e4hne der Chinchilla sind wurzellos. Sie haben eine zum Zahnfach hin offene Zahnh\u00f6hle und wachsen zeitlebens. Der Zahnwechsel vom Milch- auf das bleibende Gebiss findet bereits im Mutterleib vor der Geburt statt.\n\nUnterschiede zwischen den Arten:\n\nDie beiden Arten unterscheiden sich nicht sehr deutlich voneinander. Das Kurzschwanz-Chinchilla (in der Grafik oben) hat neben dem namensgebenden k\u00fcrzeren Schwanz kleinere Ohren, dickere Schultern und ist etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer als das Langschwanz-Chinchilla (in der Grafik unten). Die Unterschiede sind so gering, dass beide Arten manchmal zu einer Art zusammengefasst werden.\n\nVerbreitung und Lebensraum:\n\nEigentliche Chinchilla bewohnen die Andenregion im westlichen S\u00fcdamerika. Das urspr\u00fcngliche Verbreitungsgebiet der Kurzschwanz-Chinchillas umfasste das s\u00fcdliche Peru, das westliche Bolivien, das nordwestliche Argentinien und das n\u00f6rdliche Chile, die Langschwanz-Chinchillas kommen nur im n\u00f6rdlichen Peru vor.

Some 50,000 people, about half of Kiribati's total population, are already crammed onto a sand and coral strip measuring 16 sq km (6 sq miles).\n\n\"Climate change is a definite long-term threat to Kiribati, there's no doubt whatsoever about that,\" says Simon Donner, a climate scientist at the University of British Columbia who has been visiting South Tarawa since 2005.\n\n\"But that doesn't mean it's the biggest problem right now ... Any first-time visitor to Tarawa is not struck by the impacts of sea level rise, they're struck by how crowded it is.\"\n\nLow-lying South Pacific island nations such as Kiribati (pronounced Kee-ree-bahs) and Tuvalu, about halfway between northeast Australia and Hawaii, have long been the cause c\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bre for climate change and rising sea levels.\n\nStraddling the equator and spread over 3.5 million sq km (2 million sq miles) of otherwise empty ocean, Kiribati's 32 atolls and one raised coral island have an average height above sea level of just two meters (6-1/2 feet).\n\nStudies show surrounding sea levels rising at about 2.9 mm a year, well above the global average of 1 - 2 mm a year.\n\nKiribati President Anote Tong has grimly predicted his country will likely become uninhabitable in 30-60 years because of inundation and contamination of its fresh water supplies.\n\nOVERCROWDING \"A MENACE\"\n\nWhile climate change poses a serious longer-term threat, many people, including Tong, recognize that breakneck population growth is a more immediate problem. South Tarawa' population density of more than 3,000 per sq km is comparable to Los Angeles or parts of London - without the high rises.\n\nThe government fears South Tarawa's population could double to more than 100,000 by 2030 unless the birth rate and internal migration slows.\n\nRudimentary huts of little more than timber sleeping platforms and palm thatch roofs line a single dusty road running the length of the atoll. Dotted among them are pig pens, chicken coops, overcrowded grave sites and the blasted relics from one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two.\n\nBwabwa Oten, Kiribati's director of hospital services, says current annual population growth in Kiribati is close to 6 percent, with overcrowding a major contributor to disease and an infant mortality rate among the highest in the region.\n\nThe church plays an integral role in the South Pacific and efforts to limit birth rates have run into resistance. Large families are also traditional in the region, which has one of the world's highest rates of teen pregnancy.\n\nDescribing the population surge as \"a menace\", Tong has called on churches to help curb growth by allowing their members to use birth control.\n\n\"Religion is incredibly powerful in the Pacific and there is quite an overt suspicion that, when we are talking about family planning, it in fact means family stopping,\" said Bronwyn Hale of New Zealand-based Family Planning International, which is working to promote sexual and reproductive health in Kiribati.\n\nProgress is being made, with clinic visitor numbers up and a growing acceptance of the threat of over-population.\n\n\"Right now, population is the major issue, the number one issue we should face,\" said Peter Itibita, a member of the Mormon Church in South Tarawa.\n\nMany health problems also stem from a lack of clean water as rising salinity and pollution affect underground water, with diarrhea outbreaks caused by contamination from human and animal waste and other pollutants.\n\nNawerewere Hospital also has problems, with new mothers spilling from overcrowded wards onto verandas and into corridors.\n\n\"Sometimes with the new babies, we don't have the water to wash them,\" says Rina Tabi, a maternity ward nurse.\n\nPlans are underway for solar-powered energy and desalination plants but the cost of building and maintaining them is a challenge for cash-strapped Kiribati, which relies on aid and royalties from foreign fishing fleets.\n\nThe complexities of sea level change are becoming more apparent and there is little doubt that nations like Kiribati will be among the most affected. But it is equally clear that vulnerable states like Kiribati are responsible for less than 0.1 percent of global emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.", "title": "Kiribati, the sinking Pacific island paradise VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T02:06:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "507zwGn_QNc", "description": "The city has now served Speronis' attorney with an amended complaint.

In our very hectic and busy lives, we\nhave many factors that can affect us psychologically. Things such as\nstress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nAll of these factors can also contribute to erectile dysfunction. In many\ncases, it can be difficult to tell if erectile dysfunction is actually\ncaused by a medical problem, what we call organic erectile dysfunction,\nversus an actual psychological component. Also, in many cases, it may be\nmulti-factorial.\n\nThere may be multiple causes for patients to have problems with their\nerections. One way in which we can tell whether there is a psychological\nfactor, we need to know if the plumbing actually works properly. And the\nway to tell that is checking for what we call nocturnal erections.\n\nSo patients who are able to have erections in the middle of the night, as\nthis is a normal, natural process, most men will have multiple erections\nthroughout the course of the night. In cases where patients are unaware of\nwhether they are having those, there is some testing that can be done to\ntest for actual nocturnal erections. And this is called a nocturnal\ntumescence test.\n\nBut, if a patient is able to have erections that are 100 percent normal\nthroughout the course of the night, then chances are the plumbing is\nworking properly. And there may actually be a psychological component\ncontributing to the erectile dysfunction.\n\nSo it's important to consider these when talking about potential causes for\nerectile dysfunction. And it's important to discuss this with your\nphysician, prior to determining what should be done about your problem.", "title": "Psychological Causes of ED | Erection Problems", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20T12:20:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "508TP7fBq3M", "description": "I was abit throttle happy..

So I tried it with the engine running and it finally worked for me. I have a 2006 Subaru Impreza 2.5i, if that makes any difference. But from what I've read, this seems to work with many different Subaru models and years.\n\nLike I said previously, this won't disable the seatbelt warning chime completely, but at least it will stop it from continuously going off non-stop until you finally buckle up and drive off.\n\n*Note: I did NOT do this to be able to drive without my seatbelt on.

He was at peace with it all; his mother, Lois, disappearing when he was eight; being raised by Neville, a stalwart of the semi-racist no-nonsense Regional Right. \n\nNot knowing who his biological father was.\n\nIt's Darwin, 2001, and Russell and his partner Alistair have transformed Russell's childhood home into the 'Tectonic Plate'; 'hip urban caf\u00e9 and art gallery by day, queer cabaret dive by night'.\n\nWhen three separate events over the course of two weeks start to churn things up, the ghosts from Russell's past begin to intrude on his present and he embarks on a quest to determine his identity. The search transports him back to the bohemian world of his childhood; Darwin, 1975, and beyond to his conception; PNG, 1967, where bored ex-TAA hostie, Lois, has tired of Neville's conservatism  and joined the 'Moresby Arts Theatre',  where she soon starts courting liaisons with members of the community positioned more dangerously at its anarchic edges.\n\nTo a soundtrack of Suzi Quatro, Shirley Bassey and Nana Mouskouri, Russell pieces together the events leading to that fateful night when his favourite Abba record was broken and everything else fell apart.\n\nWith more than a passing nod at Tennessee Williams, Stephen Carleton has created a passionate, funny and vividly perceptive work about family and identity expertly woven together with dry wit and an earthy tell-it-like-it-is wisdom, which resonates both on a personal level and, more broadly, as a political commentary on a pivotal period in Australia's history. \n\n\"[Russell]'s quest is a personal one; to determine his own patrilineal identity, but his journey is a metaphor for the role North Australia has in determining the nation's identity, and Australia's place in this region of the world. 1975 is the pivotal year in which the region shook off the shackles of colonialism, and Australia was required to 'mature' and play an adult role in South-East Asia.\"\n(Stephen Carleton)\n\nDirected by Ian Lawson // Playwright Stephen Carleton // Designer Kris Bird //  Lighting Designer Sean Pardy // Sound Designer Guy Webster // Choreographer David McMicken  // Featuring Ella Watson-Russell, Suellen Maunder, Benhur Helwend, Kathryn Marquet, Steven Tandy and Peter Norton\n\nJOIN US FOR THE Q&A'S\n11 June following the evening performance or 12 June following the Matinee\n\nJUTE invites you to a conversation with the Bastard Territory creative team following the performance on either 11 June or 12 June.  Immediately following the show, the actors and team will return to stage.  It's a great opportunity to discuss your response to the show, for you to ask questions about the process of creating the work and allow you to delve into the creative process!\n\nLike a TED talk, it's only 20 minutes and you can come away knowing more about how theatre is created (the tricks of the trade), the problem solving that the creative team went through to come up with solutions, and an understanding of how these creative beings work. And of course it's a great opportunity to meet the cast after their performance. \n\nWe look forward to these conversations with you.", "title": "Bastard Territory - Meet the Cast!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-14T00:45:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "50K0Ndx2UMs", "description": "", "title": "Oriane-Typha-Spore 30-11-2008.avi", "publishedDate": "2008-12-02T11:16:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "50K8nMBKOA8", "description": "More details have been released on Destiny's first expansion pack, the Dark Below, which is set to release on December 9th.

Man f\u00e4ngt mit der Zahlenreihe ganz rechts an. Von der obersten Zahl werden die darunter liegenden Zahlen abgezogen. Das Ergebnis schreibt man unter den Ergebnisstrich. \nFalls eine Zahlenreihe weniger als 0, -10, -20 ergibt, beh\u00e4lt man eine 1, 2, 3 im Sinn. Diese Zahl nennt sich \u00dcbertrag.\nIm Beispiel ergibt die erste Zahlenreihe 8-6-2-9=-9, darum beh\u00e4lt man 1 im Sinn.  Man schreibt eine 1 unter den Ergebnisstrich, weil das Ergebnis nicht negativ sein darf und deshalb von 9 runter gez\u00e4hlt wird. 9876543210 und dann wieder 9876 usw. In diesem Beispiel wird von der 8 runtergez\u00e4hlt bis auf das zweite mal 1.\nDie 1 im Sinn wird unter die -2 der n\u00e4chsten Zahlenreihe geschrieben und da sie davon abgezogen wird kommt noch ein Minuszeichen davor. So wird jede Zahlenreihe berechnet. \n\n\nGeroMovieOriginal:\nWenn dir das Video geholfen hat dann hilf GeroMovie und klick auf \u201eGef\u00e4llt mir\", \u201eTeilen\" und/oder \u201eAbonnieren\", schreibe einen Kommentar und/oder besuche die GeroMovie-FacebookSeite (http://www.facebook.com/GeroMovie)\nO sagt: \u201eVielen Dank!\"\n\nQuellen:\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraktion\n\nAnmerkungen:\nBanjo&Kazooie Parodie \n\nWe are not affiliated with or endorsed by the mentioned companies, persons, movies, tv-shows, games etc.\n\nMusik:\nKanal von GissDur: http://www.youtube.com/user/GissDurOriginal\nKanal von NicoFissDur: http://www.youtube.com/user/NicoFissDur\n\nGeroMovieOriginal \u00a9 w\u00fcnscht viel Spa\u00df beim Anschauen\n\n\u00a9 Oliver Dursch", "title": "Subtraktion Mathe GeroMovie (1Minute)", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T12:26:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "50UjtCKGDfc", "description": "no rood fomentation okay", "title": "Me And Adonis Turnt up", "publishedDate": "2013-12-31T21:27:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "50V27uKWdHU", "description": "the special match is arranged \nAnime:grappler baki \nhope you enjoy \nrate add comments \nand subscribe for more hot anime fights see my channel", "title": "The tiger killer vs the world's strongest creature Anime fight HD", "publishedDate": "2012-01-27T08:10:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "50V2XJC0OMI", "description": "Pope Fraize leader and founder , church of Leviathan\nexplains what theistic satanism is .", "title": "what is theistic satanism  ?", "publishedDate": "2012-07-05T17:35:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "50VhnBKLiQc", "description": "More info here:\nhttp://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter#Steps_to_play_sound:", "title": "Raspberry Pi Transmitting FM Audio Standalone !!!", "publishedDate": "2013-02-24T20:24:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "50VjZs8KqYI", "description": "At the March 2012 Insurance Model Validation Roundtable, ING Group's Head of Model Validation, Mark Vermeule, addresses the  importance of the validation function. \"It's about giving assurance to the organization...on the models that they are using,\" he says, which makes it inherently important that the models be valid, as the company is basing its decisions on the model.

purposes and to help treat many areas of lives it's important to know the many misconceptions about hypnosis.\nThe top 5 Misconceptions that Hypnotherapist get asked are:\n\n\n\u2022 You can control people\nUnder hypnosis it is impossible for the hypnotist to control you, hypnosis is the ability to help you control your own mind the hypnotherapist is a guide\n\u2022 Hypnosis is a truth Detector\nUnder hypnosis it is not possible to make someone tell the truth no matter how deep into hypnotherapy they are\n\u2022 You can make people reveal their secrets\nYou cannot make anybody tell you news they don't want to say or any secrets, the client only tells the hypnotist what they want to tell.\n\u2022 You can get stuck in hypnosis\nThere is no way to get stuck into hypnosis no matter how deep in trance you are\n\u2022 When your hypnotised you won't be able to move\nYou can move about as you please as you are in a complete relaxed state of mind\n\nWith this misconceptions there are many reasons why people still believe them and I can give examples for each but it's important to realise that they are misconceptions and no matter how deep you go into Hypnosis or which Hypnotherapist you go to that they are not true and never has any Hypnotherapist ever been able to do any of these 5 actions\n\nClive Westwood Social Pages\n\nTwitter:

Dr. Tucker, a founder and former chair of the National Congress of Black Women (NCBW) was the driving force behind the crusade to secure this national memorial to Ms. Truth, who was a slave, abolitionist, preacher and advocate of women's rights. Dr. Tucker and the NCBW spent nearly a decade in grass roots efforts to secure the legislation and funds for the memorial. Her work was completed by the current NCBW National Chair, Dr. E. Faye Williams, Esq. \"This bust of Sojourner Truth in the U.S. Capitol is an honor to all women, and will forever serve as a part of our history that celebrates the right to vote for all women,\" said Dr. Williams. The bust will remain on exhibit at Emancipation Hall inside the U.S. Capital Visitors' Center and will forever remind us all of the former slave who secured her own freedom and went on to fight hard for the rights of all women.
