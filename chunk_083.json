It's basically just what it says, it's using your palms to roll your dreads. So you first take the dread in your hand, between your thumb. Let it lay across your palm. Put your other palm on top and then just roll. You start with your fingertips at the base of your hand and then just roll all the way up to the fingertips of your other hand, and then you just keep doing this motion. \n\nWhen you get to the fingertips of your other hand, that's when you grab it with your thumb, as to not to let go and to keep the tension you just created by palm rolling, because as you palm roll it, you're twisting it and you're kind of rolling it in between your two palms. So as you get to the end of the other hand, you just grab with your thumb and then just do it again. Drop it back down. \n\nDo it again. Drop it back down. And as you can see the dread itself starts getting tighter. It smooths out, and you can also use this method with a lot more friction, if you had say, lumps or you were smoothing two dreads together. Put it in between your thumbs and then just do it real fast like, just to smooth it out, and you just let it drop down and that's the palm rolling method.", "title": "How to Do the Palm Rolling Method | Get Dreads", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T16:00:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Be65VyhKAM", "description": "Bob gets mad a Frank.", "title": "Bob's Meanness", "publishedDate": "2010-04-24T17:11:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BeGGOoJY6U", "description": "MOTORWORKS LIVE 2004", "title": "PALE ALE /  kenichi kurosawa", "publishedDate": "2008-12-17T17:17:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BepHqJJZSI", "description": "Stanton Moore explaining some grooves from his dvd \"Take It To The Streets - A Traditional Approach To New Orleans Drumming\n\nI DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS VIDEO.", "title": "Stanton Moore New Orleans/Funk Groove", "publishedDate": "2014-01-16T05:55:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Bey751Kb48", "description": "Single Videos for Better Quality", "title": "Apoc 6K Tau Vs IG", "publishedDate": "2013-12-26T16:38:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BfAQfvzHs8", "description": "Sitio oficial: http://www.disneylatino.com/disneychannel/\n\nS\u00edguenos en Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/disneychannellatinoamerica\n\n\u00a1Haz click en \"Suscribirse\" para recibir notificaciones de los nuevos videos de Disney Channel en YouTube!", "title": "Violetta: Andr\u00e9s, Cami y Maxi cantan \u00a8Dile que s\u00ed\u00a8 (Ep 73 Temp 2)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-07T12:59:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BfQk_zXRFY", "description": "bueno les presento mi bajaj 135 ls un verdadero fierrito para los que la tienen o la conocen saben de lo que hablo ,es espectacular....https://www.facebook.com/groups/BAJAJ.135.ROUSER/", "title": "bajaj rouser 135 ls", "publishedDate": "2012-08-04T00:29:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BfhyVKH9xA", "description": "Dendi - The Hand of Midas @ DreamHack Bucharest 2014\n\n========================================\nSubscribe to Na`Vi YouTube channel if you like our videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=natusvinceretv\n========================================\n\nWatch more videos:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/natusvinceretv/videos\n\nThe Official Website:\nhttp://www.navi-gaming.com\n\nFind us in social networks:\nhttp://facebook.com/natusvincere\nhttp://twitter.com/natusvincere\nhttp://vk.com/natus.vincere\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Natus-Vincere", "title": "Dendi - The Hand of Midas @ DreamHack Bucharest 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-04-27T14:03:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Bfo3Vfjfds", "description": "Ted Cruz is making news this week after referring to Net Neutrality as \"Obamacare for the internet.\" After being absolutely shut down by Al Franken on the subject, Cruz dug in deeper by making even more insane claims about Net Neutrality.

The hair bow is such a cute little trick. It kind of ebbs and flows. It always seems to come back. I'm going to show you how to do a hair bow that is high and kind of glamorous. Keep in mind too that you can do smaller versions of this anywhere on your head. You could do a low hair bow. You could do a hair bow on top of a ponytail. There are many variations of this. I'm just going to show you the most simple and the most classic. \n\nI'm going to start by hair spraying her hair away from her face. And then I'm just going to do a classic ponytail. And then a great trick at home if you're trying to get, if whenever you do a ponytail you always have a little of bagginess here in the nape of your neck, would be to tilt your head backwards and do that finishing step. It keeps it really nice and tight. So you're going to wrap the ponytail around. And on whatever is going to be your last rotation, so this is the third round I'm making with the ponytail, I am going to make a loop with my hair. So I'm just not going to pull the hair all the way up. And then I'm just going to place the rest of the hair in the front. So this is going to be the start of our hair bow. \n\nSo I'm just going to loosen it up a little bit more. And I'm going to start to fan out the hair. Then, in the center, I start to make a little part in the hair. You can see we're already getting a little bit of a hair bow already. Then I'm going to take this center hair here. Comb it a little bit. I'm going to gather the ends up into a little point. And then I'm going to put it in between our two little puffs that we just made. And I'm going to bobby pin it in the back. Turn her around so you can see that. So I'm just going to bobby pin it. And don't worry about the bobby pins just yet because I'm going to cover them. And I'm going to flip her around. \n\nWe're going to finesse our bow here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take and attach the bow to the head first. I'm going to take little bobby pins and I'm just going to attach the bottom of the hair to the head. And you can do this in a couple of places if you want. Whatever makes it feel secure. And then from there I'm going to start to lift my bow up. I'm going to hold it a little bit with my hand. Spray it with a heavier hold hairspray. A little bit around the face with that. And then, like I promised, I'm going to hide those bobby pins in the back. \n\nSo in this case now that it's all done, I really just have to tuck it up into one side of the bow and it's completely concealed from the back. I'm going to add just one more bobby pin. I'm just holding the back of my bow forward because I can see a little gap here in between the center of the bow and the rest of it. And there you have your completed hair bow.", "title": "How to Make a Hair Bow | Hair Tutorials", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T17:57:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Brf8Hr4UaQ", "description": "29\ucd08\uc601\ud654\uc81c - \uc544\uce68\uc0c1 (\uc774\ub3c4\uc724 \uac10\ub3c5) \ud55c\uc2dd\uc7ac\ub2e8\n\n\ub9e4\uc77c \uc0c8\ubcbd 6\uc2dc\uba74 \uae30\uc0c1\ud558\uc5ec \uccad\uc18c\uc77c\uc744 \ub098\uac00\ub294 \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8. \uadf8\ub140\uac00 \ub098\uac04 \ub4a4 \uc5bc\ub9c8 \ud6c4 \uc77c\uc5b4\ub09c \uc544\ub4e4\uc740 \ubc30\uace0\ud514\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ud0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc624\ub298\ub3c4 \ucc28\ub824\uc9c4 \uc544\uce68\uc0c1\uc740 \ubc25\uacfc \uae40\uce58, \ub9d1\uc740 \uad6d\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \uccad\uc18c\uc77c\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc804\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ub9cc\uc744 \ud138\uc5b4\ub193\ub294\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c \ub0a0 \uc544\ub4e4\uc740 \uadfc\ubb34 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud658\uacbd\ubbf8\ud654\ubcf5\uc744 \uc785\uc740 \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8\ub97c \ub9c8\uc8fc\uce58\uac8c \ub418\uace0 \uadf8\ub140\ub97c \ubabb \ubcf8 \ucc99 \ud558\ub294\ub370... \uc81c\uc791\uc9c4 - \uac10\ub3c5/\uac01\ubcf8 \uc774\ub3c4\uc724, \ucd2c\uc601/\ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc774\ub3c4\uc724 CAST - \uc544\ub4e4\uc5ed \ubc15\uc131\ubbfc, \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc601\ud76c BGM - Sunset Smile(Zidovudine) + All is Well(Jae.key - Diary 1)", "title": "29\ucd08\uc601\ud654\uc81c - \uc544\uce68\uc0c1 (\uc774\ub3c4\uc724 \uac10\ub3c5) \ud55c\uc2dd\uc7ac\ub2e8", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T12:41:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Bs-9NEEABw", "description": "A montage of some pretty explosive and dangerous chemical reactions", "title": "The most destructive chemical reactions", "publishedDate": "2011-12-29T05:42:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Bs5jpZ7NVk", "description": "mg buck", "title": "mg buck", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T21:38:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4BsmePiXC0c", "description": "New King James Version, New Testament Bible on DVD from http://BiblesonDVD.com/\n\nHoly Bible, New King James Version is fast becoming today's most requested Bible translation.

Subscribe for other quote recommendations.\n\nDemaratus (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) was a king of Sparta from 515 until 491 BC, of the Eurypontid line, successor to his father Ariston. As king, he is known chiefly for his opposition to the other, co-ruling Spartan king, Cleomenes I.\n\nWhen Cleomenes attempted to make Isagoras tyrant in Athens, Demaratus tried unsuccessfully to frustrate his plans. In 491 BC, Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (earth and water) to Persia. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of medism, and Cleomenes I crossed over to the island to arrest those responsible. His first attempt was unsuccessful, due to interference from Demaratus, who did his utmost to bring Cleomenes into disfavour at home.\n\nIn retaliation, Cleomenes urged Leotychidas, a relative and personal enemy of Demaratus, to claim the throne on the ground that the latter was not really the son of Ariston, but of Agetus, his mother's first husband. Cleomenes bribed the Delphic oracle, to pronounce in favor of Leotychidas, who became king in 491 BC.\n\nAfter the deposition of Demaratus, Cleomenes visited the island of Aegina for a second time, accompanied by his new colleague Leotychides, seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.\n\nOn his abdication, Demaratus was forced to flee. He went to the court of the Persian king Darius I, who gave him the cities of Pergamum, Teuthrania and Halisarna, where his descendants Eurysthenes and Procles still ruled at the beginning of the 4th century.\n\nHe accompanied Xerxes I on his invasion of Greece in 480 BC and is alleged to have warned Xerxes not to underestimate the Spartans before the Battle of Thermopylae.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\n\nThe guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies. Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.\n\nIn Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.\n\nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet \"guinea pig\" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.", "title": "Nervous guinea pig - strange noises", "publishedDate": "2013-06-22T10:05:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4C4lkEh0-_E", "description": "Get those medical secrets: http://www.health101.pw/Medical-Secrets.shtml\n\nThis video shows you how to say or pronounce Lymphocytopenia.\n\nAudio is from cancer.gov.", "title": "How to Say or Pronounce Lymphocytopenia", "publishedDate": "2013-08-13T05:57:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "4C53cY5BDNk", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C53cY5BDNk\n\nThe Fans -

Cilj projekta je povezivanje organizacija civilnog dru\u0161tva, razmjena iskustava kao i ja\u010danje njihove  uloge u procesu lokalnog i regionalnog ekonomskog razvoja te unapre\u0111enja saradnje izme\u0111u vladinog, nevladinog i privatnog sektora. Projekat LED NET \u010dija ukupna vrijednost prelazi 200 hiljada eura provodi se u suradnji sa Udru\u017eenjem za poduzetni\u0161tvo i posao LINK Mostar,Nezavisnim birom za razvoj Grada\u010dac,Udru\u017eenjem poduzetnika i poslodavaca \u017dep\u010de ali i Centrom za razvoj Hercegovine Trebinje.Jedna od aktivnosti u okviru projekta je i studijska posjeta Vara\u017edinskoj \u017eupaniji kao jednoj od vode\u0107ih \u017eupanija u Hrvatskoj, kako bi se upoznala sa primjerima dobre suradnje te op\u0107enito osmi\u0161ljavanjem i provo\u0111enjem projekata razvojne agencije i tvrtki u vlasni\u0161tvu Vara\u017edinske \u017eupanije, poput Poslovnih zona te razvojnih i garancijskih agencija.\n\n\nRazmjena znanja i pozitivnih iskustava koja vodi ka ja\u010danju lokalne ekonomije i stvaranju boljih uvjeta za ekonomski razvoj poduzetni\u0161tva, jedna je od aktivnosti planirana u sklopu projekta, \u0161to se upravo desilo u Vara\u017edinskoj \u017eupaniji. Biti \u017eupan u Vara\u017edinskoj \u017eupaniji, Predragu \u0160tomeru, ka\u017ee,  nije nimalo te\u0161ko. Najkonkurentnija je to \u017eupanija u Hrvatskoj koja ujedno ima najmanju stopu nezaposlenosti. Pohvaliti se mogu ulaganjem u obrazovanje, privredu ali i ja\u010danjem kapaciteta koji poma\u017eu poduzetnicima od strane formirane razvojne i garancijske agencije za razvoj a potom poslovnim i slobodnim zonama. Sve su to pozitivni primjeri koji su prezentirani mre\u017ei LED NET-a.\n\nPostojanje razvojne agencije za pripremu i implementaciju projekata iz Evropske Unije jako je bitno. U sedam godina rada, vara\u017edinska Razvojna agencija realizirala je 30 projekata u vrijednosti od vi\u0161e 12 miliona eura.Kako vole re\u0107i, produ\u017eena su ruka op\u0107ina i gradova jer nude usluge od prijave,izrade pa do  provedbe projekta. Upravo onim \u010dime se uspje\u0161no bavi i biha\u0107ki Plod Centar.\n\nPored toga,tu su i uspjesi od strane Garanacijske agencije vara\u017edinske \u017eupanije, koja je  kao takva prva nastala u ovoj \u017eupaniji prije pet godina.\n\nUvijek prisutni na evropskom tr\u017ei\u0161tu su i predstavnici Poslovne zone kako bi strane investicije doveli u Hrvatsku.  Posao je to, koji je prema rije\u010dima direktorice, vi\u0161e rudni\u010dki ali se isplati.\nPored toga, imaju formirane i slobdone zone \u010diji komplek ispunjava 11 investirora.\n\nPlod Centar iz Biha\u0107a zajendno sa partnerima u okviru projekta Led Net  bio je impresioniran sa onim \u0161to je vidio u Vara\u017edinu.", "title": "Plod Centar za promociju lokalnog razvoja Biha\u0107", "publishedDate": "2012-06-15T10:27:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4C7tyqNl54I", "description": "Nintendo fans, unite!\u25bahttp://tinyurl.com/NintendoFan\n\nWe're kicking off a new series of preview videos for Smash Bros.

Discounting?\nhttp://www.tradedebtorfinance.com.au/services/receivables-finance.html\n\nOften business owners are very nervous about selling of their assets, and as a business owner myself, I don't blame them.\nFactoring, Debtor Finance, Invoice discounting, which product suits my business? Can I afford it? Will they harass my debtors? Will my debtors think I am going broke? What happens if someone doesn't pay? Will they fund just one debtor? Will they need property?\n\n Why guess with this decision making when you have a firm who doesn't have any direct up fronts and will offer you up to 4 options at a time to choose from, and will offer a life time support with the lender chosen, again at no direct cost to your firm. \n\nFactoring, Debtor Finance, Invoice Discounting offer business owners the chance to sell their invoices and get access to up to 90% of their value so they can grow their business. Once the debtor pays his account, the lender releases the final 10% less any fees incurred. It is a very simple product.\n\nIn the past Factoring, debtor finance, Invoice Discounting lenders have sold these products as a measure of last resort. These lending costs are a recipe for disaster as they too add to the bottom line, as the client often borrows in order to pay bad debt.\n\nFactoring lenders are often full service products. They are more expensive as they offer more service. Smaller businesses often are drawn to these products.\n\nDebtor Finance lenders offer a client a more complete product, as it acts as an overdraft on their debtor invoicing. This gives the clients some control of borrowings and the length of time it's out for. Often more larger clients use these products. Invoice Discounting lenders are often bank products. Same principal, overdraft on invoices, but often much larger clients with larger turnovers attract the better rates.\n\nInvoice Discounting is often confidential and clients have to have excellent back end systems in order to obtain.\nTrade Debtor Finance Consultants offers an obligation free quote with up to 4 lender to choose from. We also offer support for the life of the loan. Don't get caught by brokers, who slug you upfront and disappear when it all goes bad.

Kerudung umumnya dipakai oleh wanita muslim.Tetapi kerudung juga sering dipakai oleh perempuan non muslim. Kerudung sendiri tidak dianjurkan dalam Islam, karena desain kerudung cuma sebagai penutup kepala saja. Kerudung yang hanya sebagai penutup kepala, tidak sepanjang khimar yang mampu menutupi dada wanita sekaligus. \n\nPerempuan Yahudi Ortodoks yang sudah menikah, misalnya, diwajibkan untuk menutupi rambut mereka, seringkali menggunakan kerudung yang dikenal dengan nama tiche atau snood, sesuai dengan aturan kesopanan tzniot. Kerudung dulunya dipakai juga oleh perempuan Kristen yang telah menikah di Eropa pada abad pertengahan, bahkan dipakai juga oleh perempuan yang belum menikah.\n\nHampir sama dengan kerudung, ada istilah khimar. Sesuai yang tertera dalam surat An-Nur ayat 31 Khimar  adalah apa yang dapat menutupi kepala, leher dan dada tanpa menutupi muka. Khimar merupakan pakaian atas atau penutup kepala. Desain pakaian ini yaitu menutupi kepala, leher dan menjulur hingga menutupi dada wanita dari belakang maupun dari depan (termasuk menutupi tulang selangka). Khimar ini tidak diikatkan ke leher seperti kerudung, karena jika hal tersebut dilakukan, maka akan memperjelas bentuk lekuk dada dari wanita. Jadi khimar harus menjulur lurus kebawah dari kepala ke seluruh dada tertutupi.\nHijab\nHijab menurut Al-Quran artinya penutup secara umum. Allah SWT. dalam surat Al Ahzabayat 58 memerintahkan kepada para sahabat Nabi SAW  waktu mereka meminta suatu barang pada istri Nabi SAW untuk memintanya dari balik hijab. Jadi, hijab brarti umum, bisa berupa tirai pembatas.\nSehingga memang terkadang kata hijab dimaksudkan untuk makna jilbab. Adapun makna lain dari hijab adalah sesuatu yang menutupi atau menghalangi dirinya. Hijab berasal dari kata hajaban yang artinya menutupi, dengan kata lain al-Hijab adalah benda yang menutupi sesuatu.\nJilbab\nSebagaimana disimpulkan oleh Al Qurthuby: \"Jilbab adalah pakaian yang menutupi seluruh tubuh\".

This little guy tucked himself under the windshield where it meets the dashboard and disappeared before i could release it.  Usually this would result in a petrified lizard carcass emerging somehow months or weeks later, and unless it's a large snake, I'm not going to disassemble the dash of a car to find a lizard.  An hour or two later, I needed to go run some errands, and noticed that on my way back home that this little survivor was now on the passenger door window sill.  I reached for the only device available tro film this, and managed to get a few seconds.  When I arrived home, I got my trusty Playbook and water mister, which I have used to mist the tarantulas I've kept, and it seemed to enjoy that.  Thern I was able to release it into a nearby tree and watch it climb about 20 feet to safety..

If my memory serves correctly, those are known as \"old world chameleons\", while this type of smaller lizard is mostr seen frequesntly in everyone's bushes and fauna around their home.  I don't think i've ever even seen one of these lizards in true woodlands in florida, so they seem as about as semi-domesticated or \"used to\" man as the local squirrels and pigeons.

NASA's ISS-RapidScat wind-watching scatterometer, which is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station no earlier than Sept. 19, will be the first science payload to be robotically assembled in space since the space station itself. This image shows the instrument assembly on the left, shrouded in white. On the right is Rapid-Scat's nadir adapter, a very sophisticated bracket that points the scatterometer toward Earth so that it can record the direction and speed of ocean winds. The two pieces are stowed in the unpressurized trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\n\nHoward Eisen, the ISS-RapidScat project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, said, \"Another mission had the idea of a two-piece payload first, but we beat them to the punch.\" The RapidScat team designed and built both parts of the science payload in an 18-month-long sprint so as to take advantage of an available berthing space on the space station and a free ride on a resupply mission. The other two-piece payload is still a year and a half from launch.\n\nEach piece of the ISS-RapidScat payload is attached to the space station by a standardized interface called a Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism, or FRAM. JPL's Stacey Boland, an engineer on the ISS-RapidScat team, explained, \"The space station is almost like a Lego system, and a FRAM is a particular type of Lego block. We had to build on two separate Lego blocks because each block can only hold a certain amount of cargo.\"\n\nEisen noted, \"We are not only robotically assembled, we are robotically installed.\" When the Dragon spacecraft reaches the station, a robotic arm will grapple it and bring it to its docking port. Using a different end effector -- a mechanical hand -- the arm will first extract the nadir adapter from the trunk and install it on an external site on the Columbus module of the space station. The arm will then pluck the RapidScat instrument assembly from the trunk and attach it to the nadir adapter, completing the installation.

Though of course I would not expect anyone to know this. As it turns out minds can and do control quantum tunneling all of the time. If it were not so we would all be on the floor having seizures right now.\n\nA nerve signal is transmitted through dendrite barriers which are too thick to allow for classical mechanical actions. The conclusion therefore is that the nerve impulse must be transmitted via quantum tunneling. In particular neuroscientist John Eccles discovered that a hydrogen atom tunnels through the potential barrier of the dendrite wall to cross the synapse and into the other dendrite. \n\nFor those interested here is his paper on the topic with Friedrich Beck, entitled \"Quantum aspects of brain activity and the role of consciousness:\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50549/\n\nBefore the tunneling event occurs the wavefunction stacks up very neatly near the wall of the first dendrite, in a controlled on command sort of way. In quantum mechanics this is highly unusual because it indicates controlled non-probabilistic quantum activity. This however does not violate quantum mechanics as once wavefunction collapse has occured the probability amplitudes are stacked up in a deterministic Dirac spike. And so we have an actual case of mind over matter within neurons -nano-scale telekinesis if you will!\n\nThe question is of course then how a mind could control quantum probabilities when ordinary physical mechanisms could not. The answer is that the mind and the wavefunction are similar in type and so can affect each other directly. The mind exists as an a priori non-empirical entity. Similarly the wavefunction is not exactly physical as such as it lacks any physical units of any kind but is rather exists as a pure mathematical probability. Like then interacts with like. \n\nEmpirically defined entities however can not do this as the wavefunction can be seen as defining space time and energy units (and thus the entire category of \"physicality\") internally. Since objects with physically defined units are controlled by the wavefunction rather than vice-versa, they can not then control the wavefunction \"backwards\" so to speak.", "title": "Mind-Dependent Quantum Tunneling Across Dendrite Barriers", "publishedDate": "2010-08-19T20:15:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4CtgvQg4qy4", "description": "Canal+ 1 estrena el pr\u00f3ximo 26 de agosto a las 22.05 horas 'Behind the Candelabra', un biopic que aborda la vida del legendario m\u00fasico Liberace y su joven amante, Scott Thorson, el cual a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde escribi\u00f3 la novela en la que se basa el film.

It is often called the housecat when kept as an indoor pet, or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship, and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.\n\nCats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones, and types of cat-specific body language.\n\nCats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, and the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.\n\nSince cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there,[9] but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9500 years ago (7500 BC).\n\nA genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BC, in West Asia.[9][11] Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.\n\nThe English word cat (Old English catt) is in origin a loanword, introduced to many languages of Europe from Latin cattus[14] and Byzantine Greek \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1, including Portuguese and Spanish gato, French chat, German Katze, Lithuanian kat\u0117 and Old Church Slavonic kotka, among others.[15] The ultimate source of the word is Afroasiatic, presumably from Late Egyptian \u010daute,[16] the feminine of \u010daus \"wildcat\". The word was introduced, together with the domestic animal itself, to the Roman Republic by the 1st century BC.[citation needed] An alternative word with cognates in many languages is English puss (pussycat). Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian pui\u017e\u0117 and Irish puis\u00edn. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.\n\nA group of cats is referred to as a \"clowder\" or a \"glaring\",[19] a male cat is called a \"tom\" or \"tomcat\"[20] (or a \"gib\",[21] if neutered), an unaltered female is called a \"queen\",[22] and a pre-pubescent juvenile is referred to as a \"kitten\". Although spayed females have no commonly used name, in some rare instances immature or spayed females are referred to as a \"molly\".[citation needed] The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its \"sire\", and its female progenitor is its \"dam\". In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.\n\nA pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.\n\nWhile the African wildcat is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed, there are several intermediate stages between domestic pet and pedigree cats on the one hand and those entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-feral cat is a mostly outdoor cat that is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage in rubbish, but are typically wary of human interaction.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "title": "10 Most Popular Cat Breeds Around The World", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T13:07:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "4D5MsCkl1FM", "description": "Asiatic dayflower (\" Commelina communis\") is a common plant found in gardens.

In a Department of Energy-sponsored Energy Frontier Research Center on \"Understanding Charge Separation and Transfer in Energy Materials\" at UT, ICES faculty member, Peter Rossky, is studying the basis for the effectiveness of different molecular building blocks, at the atomic and electronic level.

The purple spheres represent the location of the excitation, with radius scaling with the distribution of that excitation over the molecular rings. The full atomic motion of the polymer is simulated in time; the observed motion of the excitation is in response to the atomic vibrations.

They are also known as the Blackfooted Penguin. And before, they were called the Jackass Penguin. Because African pequins sound like a donkey's bray. Let's be politically correct, they are no donkey. They are African Penguins.  \n\nMy African Penguin family is spread across the south-western coast of Africa. Today they live in colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa Bay, close to Port Elizabeth, South Africa, with the largest colony on Dyer Island. \n\nMy African Peguin family did not like the African main land due to intruders, and other predators, predators who stole their eggs and who killed them. But wait! in the 1980's these proud birds returned to the African mainland, close to Cape Town, at Boulders Beach,  Simon's Town, and Stony Point in Betty's Bay. Can you believe it, these penguins decided to return and humans had nothing to do with it. \n\nOk. I agree, That's not entirely fair, I think it is because of good people like you that they were able to prosper again on the African main land. But it's not all that easy.   \n\nToday you'll find me at Boulders Beach in Simon's Town. My African penquin colony is very popular with tourist.

In questo appuntamento, dedicato alla musica, sono state presentate due opere: \"Domani no\" di Cristiano Carriero, Gelsorosso Editore, un volume che racconta come, nell'estate del 2001, Ernesto Celi, in arte Boavida, raggiunge la vetta della hit parade con il singolo 'Ossessione Onirica'. Un successo inaspettato e difficile da gestire per un ragazzo timido e poco propenso a vivere sotto i riflettori. La casa discografica gli impone le canzoni, i musicisti e uno stile da ragazzo della porta accanto e da cantante disimpegnato in cui lui non si riconosce affatto. Deve scegliere: accettare tutto questo e vivere di musica, oppure lasciar perdere, tornare a casa e sentirsi rinfacciare le scelte fatte. Un percorso di andata e ritorno. Un romanzo di formazione, distruzione e rinascita quello di Carriero che tra alti e bassi, addii e colpi di scena ci racconta dell'Italia fatta di escort e di cialtroni e dell'industria musicale che crea fenomeni da baraccone. La seconda opera presentata \u00e8 stata: \"Quando suonavo il jazz\" di Carmela Formicola, Edizione Florestano, che racconta di Sebastiano 'Seb' Mariani, ex jazzista finito a suonare il karaoke in un locale americaneggiante della periferia barese.

First of all, make sure you're running on the latest iTunes. You can check this in the iTunes menu:  iTunes -- Check for Updates. If it says that you run the latest version, everything is fine.\n\nStep 2.  From the same iTunes menu, go to \u201ePreferences\", then \u201eDevices\". If you ever did an iTunes-assisted backup on your hard drive, you should see a list of backups here. \nStep 3.  Simply select the file and click Delete. It will go \u201epoumpf!\", like all  the Apple items do when they disappear.\n\nStep 4.  In case you did an iCloud backup, with or without iTunes, you can manage its' deletion directly from the  iOS interface. From the home screen go to \u201eSettings\", iCloud and scroll down to select \u201eStorage & Backup\" option at the bottom of the screen.\n\nStep 5.  Tap in \u201eManage Storage\" and then on your phone name to enter storage details.\n\nStep 6.  Here you can select which components of your digital property you want to be backed up on the cloud. You might want to simply unsync your emails, or your pictures -- see what is taking most space from the backed-up items and toggle it off to delete that component from your iCloud account.\n Step 7.  If you're opting for an all-inclusive option, the Delete backup feature is located at the end of this list. You are going to both turn off the backup feature, and delete all the backed up data from iCloud.  Confirm if you will, and watch your online gigabytes being given back to you at the end.\n\nResult:  Now you have more space and much more knowledge about backups on iOS7.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What's missing?

A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we've taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\n\nWe wanted to make a game where you're not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you'll feel the loss that comes with that.\n\nThat's where the drama is, that's where the story happens, and it's the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience. \n\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\n\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory -- and we want you to join us.\n\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\n\nThe Mandate is a 6 player cooperative sci-fi RPG designed for PC (Dx11, Unity), Linux, and Mac.", "title": "The Mandate Backstory Trailer Only", "publishedDate": "2013-10-01T06:19:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DZnx1mGyq4", "description": "Robert Llewellyn introduces Ruby and Elvis, a young mother and her joey as they begin their gruelling journey to survive together in the Australian outback.

The young girl in the video is being groomed by an adult with a fine-toothed comb. Toward the end of the video, hundreds of lice can be seen crawling around on the comb. \n\nAnyone can get lice and it\u2019s an allergic reaction that causes one\u2019s scalp to itch. Keep in mind that itchiness sometimes doesn\u2019t develop for up to three months.\n\nHead lice live for about 30 days feeding on the blood of their host. Females lay about six eggs a day. They cement the egg, called a \u2018nit\u2019, to a hair shaft usually within an inch of the hosts scalp. Each nit contains a single louse embryo and each female louse can lay upwards of 150 nits in one lifetime.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

I used leather from a bag of scrap I bought from a craft store, a sewing awl from Harbour Freight and just waxed it with paste wax. With a little patience and minimal supplies you can have a great looking holster. I was so excited about making the holster that I made a mag pouch to go with it. My gun is a Ruger P95 with 15 round stainless mags. It's an inexpensive, fun gun that hasn't malfunctioned a single time. But this type of holster will work for any gun make or model. Glocks, Ruger, S&W, Colt, Kel-Tec, Kimber, etc. For those who want to make a holster of their own, I had watched a video by a fella named Eric Adams, it's a three part video, and he shows the process. From there I just kind of winged it and came up with a nice holster. If you have any questions, let me know. Also, if you've made your own holsters, I'd love to hear about them, or even better see them, leave comment, send photos, links and so on to me on youtube or facebook. More photos coming soon to facebook. If interest is high, I'll make a holster for another gun and do a how to video. Thanks for watching.

Gemini is sometimes associated with the norse gods Loki, Freyr, and Freyja the Slavic deity Veles, and Greek god Asklepios/Aesculapius, the goddesses Eris/Discordia, the goddess Hebe, and goddess Ate. Being twins, Gemini can also be associated with the Greek twins Apollo and Artemis The astrological symbol for Gemini is the Roman numeral for two, to represent the twins and duality. Such is the case with this one;  a hybrid wood and steel roller coaster located at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. Built in 1978 by Arrow Dynamics and designed by Ron Toomer, it is a racing roller coaster. Also, Cedar Point claims that when the ride debuted it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world.\n\nThe structure is considered hybrid since the track is actually tubular steel, while the support is wood. Two trains, red and blue, are dispatched on two tracks that run parallel to each other throughout the ride until the end when they diverge into their own helix before coming back together to finish the ride.\n\nAlthough prohibited, riders on separate trains often give each other high-fives as both trains pass through curves. Gemini has one of the highest capacities of any ride in the park. Gemini's station previously featured a double sided entry, allowing guests to enter the station from both the front and the back. Eventually modified to have guests only enter from the back of the station due to confusion and congestion caused by the double entry, the stairway formerly used for the queue at the front of the station still remains. When conditions permit, Gemini's trim brakes are disengaged, and a slightly faster ride is experienced. This is especially noticeable when traveling through the helixes at the end of the ride. When the ride opens in the morning (or when attendance is low) the ride only operates one colored side. Thus, on some days the coaster may not race at all. Gemini is known for the fact that either side may win the race instead of the usual predictable results on other rides.", "title": "Cedar Point-The Gemini Story", "publishedDate": "2008-11-03T01:13:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DjAuPxHxKM", "description": "ISIS allegedly makes over $1mn a day in black market oil sales.

Please read further.\n\nA quote from the Pilot submitted on Avcom.\n\n''Hi to all, Paul, great fotos by the way, its a pity there aint any of the Oryx, I really did try hard to put on a good display and hung her by the tail specially for the foto gurus. Please allow me to inform all critics what actually happened on my second to last wing-over where several members seem to think that we \"crapped\" our pants.  Firstly, to those who have no Oryx flying experience, this is an extremely powerful machine, at the day of the airshow we were light on fuel due to the opening para drop and flypast which was not part of my planning. The whole sequance was flown at approx 60%(11-13CP) torque to keep it nice and tight. The airframe has limitations and to remain within these limitations one has to sacrifice power available(CP) to perform steep turns and tight manoeuvres. If you look at the clip on YouTube, you will notice once I went level the nose yawed left, this was the first time I felt the need to increase power. Yes, I did not intend to recover so low as this was not how we prctised, please rest assured, at no stage was any member of the crew \"crapping\" their pants. Certain manoeuvres like the wingover are meant to be entered from a downwind position, there are obvious reasons for this, to please the crowd and to put on a show to be enjoyed by all members present,  we pilots take calculated risks to achieve our objectives.\nI really hope that this will bring peace to mind to all those who feel that we were in any sort of danger or scared, to be honest, flying at FL075 with people jumping out of the helicopter was the most terrifying experience I have had in a while. If there is anybody who might have the complete sequence recorder, I would really appreciate a copy, not the crapping myself wingover, seen that several times.''\n\nThanks for setting the record straight...", "title": "Oryx", "publishedDate": "2011-07-16T16:31:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DpFg9wX_qw", "description": "Che elementi sei?\nAcqua e calci!", "title": "Acqua e pedate", "publishedDate": "2011-03-08T16:19:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DpLAqCHFPc", "description": "BOOMSTICK!\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/AizenHoN\nhttp://honportal.org/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/HonPortal\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/HoNPortalorg\nhttp://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?t=364275", "title": "Heroes of Newerth - Witch Hunter", "publishedDate": "2012-06-08T11:59:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DpW_1ZrZWY", "description": "Bethesda has confirmed TESO has been delayed on consoles, but also announced PC characters will transfer over.", "title": "The Elder Scrolls Online PS4 and Xbox One Delayed - IGN News", "publishedDate": "2014-05-08T14:35:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4DqiFtf5tzI", "description": "Look what I found hiding on my hard drive!

It occurs in saprotrophs or heterotrophs, and is most often associated with fungi (for example Mucor and Rhizobium) and soil bacteria. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called saprobes; saprotrophic plants or bacterial flora are called saprophytes (sapro- + -phyte, \"rotten material\" + \"plant\"). The process is most often facilitated through the active transport of such materials through endocytosis within the internal mycelium and its constituent hyphae.\nVarious word roots relating to decayed matter (detritus, sapro-), eating and nutrition (-vore, -phage), and plants or life forms (-phyte, -obe) produce various terms, such as detritivore, detritophage, saprotroph, saprophyte, saprophage, and saprobe; their meanings overlap, although technical distinctions (based on physiologic mechanisms) narrow the senses. For example, usage distinctions can be made based on macroscopic swallowing of detritus (as an earthworm does) versus microscopic lysis of detritus (as a mushroom does).\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Saprotrophic nutrition", "publishedDate": "2014-11-05T16:36:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4EHQXJZgi7E", "description": "The ITmini is a small ORC turbine that uses waste heat to spin a direct drive DC generator.

The fact that the athlete lowers the leg more than driving hard into the ground reduces the ground impact during each step.\n\nA-Jump: - encourages overemphasis of the vertical force application. Good for observing asymmetrical differences between low limb jumping and landing patterns.\n\nA-Bound: Encourages horizontal force application which is more specific to sprinting, it can be used to assess asymmetrical differences in leg drive. \n\nA-Run (Progressive): - Focuses on quality the A pattern when approaching maximum stride frequency (only to be performed for a short duration 2-4s).

Speak up against bad cops.\n\nWE NEED YOU TO HELP US MAKE THIS VIRAL! SEND IT TO EVERYONE! WE DID IT BEFORE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN! THIS STORY MUST BE TOLD!\n\nRick Simpson's house was raided again for the third time, November 25, 2009 by RCMP and several unidentified police who refused to show a warrant or produce their business cards when asked by Mike Simpson, Rick Simpson's son and caretaker of his father's land. Shortly after the raid, when no detachments would take direct responsibility, we uploaded a clip of the actual raid showing the officers breaking the doors, and entering the house with duffle bags. \n\nAfter 6 days and over 6,000 views - YouTube removed the video - calling it \"Inappropriate Content\". (Where would Rodney King's justice be without the video that showcased his brutal beating by LAPD officers? Officers like these ones who will do whatever they please and never answer for it.\n\nA Halifax, Nova Scotia newspaper called THE CHRONICLE HERALD printed a news story in the December 16th issue. In it, the Herald reported that... - Unbeknownst to police officers who took part in the raid, there was a video device taping the raid from inside the home. When the tape showed up on YouTube and Mr. Simpson's website, Sgt. Leger said officers took notice.\n\n\"We were just recently made aware of the tape and it's under review,\" she said. \"Officer safety is important to us,\" she said. \"The tape is being reviewed to ensure that the safety of the officers has not been put in jeopardy because they have been identified.\" Sgt. Leger said.\n\nIt would appear that the public should be worried about their own safety, with officers like these on duty in Nova Scotia.\n\nIf the police were doing nothing wrong, and they followed their own protocol, why did they steal the cameras they say they knew nothing about? Why is YouTube removing videos showing innappropriate police behavior? Those types of videos are all over the Internet. The removal of the video sparked outrage in the Internet community, causing people to telephone various websites to determine where the video was and if they could get it back on. Bonnie King, of Salem News http://www.salem-news.com/articles/december102009/simpson_raid_bk.php in Oregon, and Paula Gloria of MNN in New York http://www.youtube.com/paulagloria  have been granted several photographs and videos of the raid, and have both been extremely supportive of this cause and the current situation we are dealing with in regard to police misconduct.\n\nDid you miss it?? Rewind the video and look for the surveillance sticker on the front door they smashed in during the actual raid footage. It's there in plain sight.  I submit to you, the public eye, that officers wanted to hide what they REALLY did to Rick Simpson while they raided his property, and it doesn't match up with what they have already stated publicly. Are you seeing what we are up against here yet? This is why you hear about this on the internet and not on the television, even the internet is becoming censored. Demand justice for Rick Simpson!!!\n\nWe are not looking for violence, or threats of any kind toward these officers, but we do wish to expose their corruption and lies, and show you in plain view how we came to that conclusion. With these lies exposed, what else will they do to cover their tracks?  Send this to your local news stations. This corruption must end here and now! If not for Rick Simpson, then for yourself and for your children. The day has come where we can finally prevent cancers with hemp oil, and kill many existing cancers, and literally dozens of other medical afflictions that are causing suffering throughout the world.\n\nStay tuned to find out how this plays out! \n\nREPOST THIS VIDEO!!!!! DON'T JUST LINK TO IT... COPY IT AND REPOST IT WITH A DIFFERENT NAME AND DIFFERENT TAGS.  LET'S NAIL IT TO THE INTERNET PERMANENTLY!\n\nCanada is suppoosed to be a 'free country'. When it is a crime to cure cancer, just what kind of 'country' are we living in?? Free Speech and Freedom of the Press are still legal in Canada. We will NOT be silenced!

For forty years, Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians, demolished 12,000 Palestinian homes, arrested 650,000 Palestinians, and uprooted more than a million Palestinian olive trees.\n\nSince 2002, the Apartheid Wall built on occupied Palestinian territory has effectively encircled the Palestinian population, squeezing Palestinians into truncated Bantustans, cementing Israeli expansionism, and forcing thousands Palestinians off of their land. The Wall divides farmers from their land, students from their schools, workers from their jobs, and people from their communities.\n\nDespite the fact that the International Court of Justice ruled it illegal, the Wall now encircles Palestinian towns and cities in the most massive land-grab in forty years. In its recent war against Lebanon, Israel's unilateralism and militarism have been exposed to the world. Israel continues to establish \"facts on the ground\" to maintain strategic control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to annex land and get rid of the non-Jewish indigenous population.\n\nIn Jerusalem and inside Israel, Palestinians face institutionalized discrimination and are denied equality and their full rights as citizens since 1948. And Israel continues to deny Palestinian refugees, who were forcibly exiled from their homeland in the 1947-48 war, their internationally guaranteed rights, including the right to return to one's homeland and the right to property restitution.\n\nOn March 29, 2006, Canada became the first country in the world to impose a siege on the Palestinian people living in the West Bank and Gaza, which meant total political and economic sanctions on the Palestinian Authority -- the largest employer in these occupied Palestinian territories. The stated reason for the siege was the formation of a democratically elected government in uncontested democratic elections. Canada had been one of the states calling for democratic Palestinian elections, but was displeased with the result: the victory of Hamas.\n\nThe siege is the first time in human history that the \"international community\" has decided to punish a people under occupation, let alone punish them for democratically electing their leadership. The siege has had a devastating effect on the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza including:\n\n- Eliminating the salaries, wages and livelihood of one-third of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza;\n\n- Dragging two-thirds of the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza below the poverty line (they live on less than $2 a day). These working people and their families now live in fear of starvation;\n\n- The closure of Palestinians areas: Palestinians were prevented from getting to work, school or hospital outside of their canton (usually their village, town or city) for 86% of the year.\n\nJoin together on June 10 outside the U.S. consulate in Toronto to demand that Canada lift this siege immediately, and end any and all Canadian support for the Israeli Occupation of Palestine.\n\nFor more information, please contact Palestine House:\nE-mail: info@palestinehouse.com\nPhone: 905-270-3622\nWebsite: http://www.palestinehouse.com", "title": "Global Day of Action Against Siege and Occupation Toronto 05", "publishedDate": "2007-06-12T14:08:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4EeKOGKFTdY", "description": "A court in China has imposed a nearly half billion dollar fine on British Pharmaceuticals giant, GlaxoSmithKline after the company was found guilty in a bribery probe.

SHORTSTOP teaches the offenders to take responsibility for their actions through decision-making strategies designed to result in positive future choices. With a 95% success rate, SHORTSTOP breaks the cycle that turns young people into repeat offenders by using three simple concepts:  reach youth early, involve the parents, and use a graphic courtroom setting with legal professionals and actual prisoners.\n\nJuvenile offenders, 11-17 years of age and their parents participate in two sessions held at night in an Orange County courtroom where volunteer attorneys and legal professionals dramatically present the \"legal facts of life\".\n\nThe Orange County Bar Foundation (OCBF) is a non-profit, 501 (c)(3) organization committed to keeping at-risk youth out of jail, in school, healthy and drug free through education, counseling and mentoring.

So many landscapes, variety and so much sunshine provide the visitor with endless opportunities.\n\nAt the heart of the region, the city of Gladstone overlooks its natural deep water harbour. To the south lie the shires of Calliope and Miriam Vale with idyllic, secluded beaches and scenic National Parks. 1770 is the first place in Queensland that Captain James Cook stepped ashore. Boyne Island is renowned for its beautiful foreshore parks, while its sister city of Tannum Sands offers long sandy beaches for safe coastal recreation.\n\nThe reef islands within the Gladstone Region are true coral cays, and day trips are on offer to Lady Musgrave Island and Fitzroy Lagoon where visitors can enjoy diving, snorkelling, fishing, reef walking or exploring the flora and fauna\n\nThe region has several impressive National Parks which add camping and 4 wheel driving to the adventures you can experience in the area. The spectacular cliffs of the Kroombit Tops are cloaked in diverse flora and fauna. Mount Castletower National Park lies at the base of Lake Awoonga with its impressive, yet rugged terrain. Deepwater and Eurimbula National Parks provide the contrast of open eucalypt and paperback forests with lush rainforests and quiet beaches.\n\nGladstone's Tondoon Botanic Gardens are one of Australia's few totally native botanic gardens.

I've worked in the medical field most of my adult life, however, in the previous few years, I started my own successful business in fitness coaching.\n\nOnce you get to know more about me, you will learn that I've had my struggles throughout the years with anxiety and panic attacks. I still have days where I struggle.  The difference now is that I've been pushing myself outside of my comfort zone as a Independent Beachbody Coach! My desire to help people in this business has become greater then my fear of traveling, getting on planes, meeting new people, etc.\n\nWhen you are done watching this short video, please leave a comment and connect with me on Facebook. I'd love to meet you there! http://www.facebook.com/lisahumphrey100\n\nThanks for watching!\nKey Note Speaker: Lisa Humphrey\nHi Everybody, it's Lisa Humphrey. I'm making a video today because I'm just closing in on 18 months as a Beachbody Coach. I know a lot of coaches come on and do videos about their physical transformation with the company or their financial transformation with the company; I'm not going to do that today. I'm going to focus on my personal transformation with the company. What a lot of you don't know about me is that I don't like to travel very far from home. I mean, I get lost 5 miles from home sometimes and I have to call somebody to tell me which way to turn to get back to Wegmans Grocery Store.\n\nMy first challenge came when I was about 3 months into the opportunity. There was some great training offered in Ohio. I live in New York and Ohio is about a 5 hour drive away. I made a conscious decision at that time that if I didn't attend that training and learn the right way from other coaches how to help people in this company, with our products, that I was finished. I might as well close my doors right then and there because I was not going to make it. This opportunity was not for me. So I got my MapQuest out, I did it! I came and went. I learned a lot and met a lot of great people. I then had another opportunity to go to another Game Plan Training where Carl Daikeler was going to be, the CEO of the company, in Rochester, New York. That was a little bit easier, only one hour away. So I went, I did meet Carl and got to shake his hand, he immediately put me at ease, just a great guy. So happy I did all that.\n\nWell now I have a little bit bigger challenge. The company this time has invited me to go to Laguna Beach, California for a Retreat in October. Oh, My God, I'm so excited, Laguna Beach, California? I've never been there! (sigh) But...how am I going to get there? It's from New York to California. It's like across the entire country. Well, there is no way I'm forfeiting this trip! I'm going! I can't wait to get there and meet the people that are going to be there and learn more and develop myself more as a person and grow within the company.\n\nI would not have been able to do any of this if I did not make this decision 18 months ago. Becoming a Beachbody Coach! Did I know all these other wonderful things were going to happen in my life because of making that one decision? No, I had no idea. Because I probably would not have done it if I knew it was going to be pushed outside of my comfort zone. But I want to let you know how happy I am that I did do it. I've had this personal transformation, and I'm making a youtube video about it and I'm going to blast it out to the world! I'm not embarrassed about it! I'm proud of it! I'm happy that I've helped so many people...I'm getting emotional talking about it. Please bear with me, but, it has just changed my life, so much for the better. I just have to thank Beachbody and my entire team of coaches and their coaches for always challenging me, always making me be my best and being on this journey with me! Thank you all so much for taking the time to listen to this and I hope you are all having a good afternoon!\nhttp://www.lisahumphrey.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/lisahumphrey100\nhttp://www.youtube.com/lisahumphrey100", "title": "Lisa Humphrey, Top Beachbody Coach, Overcomes Anxiety and Agoraphobia", "publishedDate": "2011-08-23T20:58:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Evrigjn3UE", "description": "A school Inspector watches and comments on an outstanding Secondary English class on Shakespeare's Macbeth.\n\nA promo of the 'Understanding Lesson Observation: Secondary' DVD by Creative Education.\n\nORDER NOW ONLINE using promotional code ZKC:\nhttp://www.creativeeducation.co.uk//media\nor ring Neil Potter on 020 8680 4077", "title": "Lesson Observation - Secondary", "publishedDate": "2010-02-04T14:51:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4EvtH1k7Ym8", "description": "Second Hoodie cover to show my tremendous appreciation to Hoodie Allen and the lovely HoodieMob.

This video is my attempt to show how the original video was filmed. There is a 20-seconds sequence that is repeated backwards and forwards, and then backwards and forwards again, and again... In each repetition, different parts are zoomed in.\n\nIn this video, the original music video is displayed at the right side. The left side shows the restoration of the frames of the original 20-seconds sequence (as much as the music video allows) with a highlighted part that corresponds to the frame at the right side.\n\nWatch the original 20-seconds sequence at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMNe71tBZmE .\n\n\nIn order to do this I developed a set of Java programs that - with the help of VirtualDub - processed the frames of the original video and produced this one. Manual adjustments were needed in only two frames out of 5741 frames!\n\n\nI don't have the rights of the song, so this video is muted.

Find this and many more recipes on the Giallozafferano App in English http://itunes.apple.com/app/giallozafferano-recipes/id384387249?mt=8\n\n***\n\nSometimes it doesn't take much to make everyone happy, for example you can prepare these tempting potato croquettes, that are very appreciated and easy to make. The recipe we suggest here is the base recipe for croquettes, made only with potatoes, flavoured with cheese, pepper and nutmeg. Let's see together what ingredients we'll need:\nFor the croquettes:\n\u2022 2,2 lbs (1 kg) of mealy potatoes (red are better)\n\u2022 1 cup (100 g) of grated parmesan cheese\n\u2022 salt / pepper \u2022 nutmeg\n\u2022 2 yolks\nFor breading:\n\u2022 2 medium eggs / breadcrumbs\n\u2022 vegetable oil for frying (peanut is better)\nLet's make together the potato croquettes:\nBegin by washing the potatoes: leave them whole and with the skin on. Then boil them in a pressure cooker for at least 20 minutes, adding some salt; if you have a normal pot, you can fill it with water to cover all the potatoes... and cook for at least 40 minutes.\nWhen the potatoes are cooked, allow them to cool a bit, then remove the skin. At this point, pass them through a potato masher... and collect the resulting puree in this bowl. Now just add the 2 yolks, the parmesan cheese, pepper, salt and some grated nutmeg. If you find the mixture a bit dry, you can add some of the remaining egg whites.\nAfter blending the mixture, take a small amount, I've taken 1 oz (35 g) for example, and form into a cylinder. Now we're ready to dip into beaten egg... and coat with breadcrumbs. Go on this way with all the remaining croquettes. \nWhen all the croquettes are breaded, it's time to fry them: heat the oil to 350\u00b0F and dip 3-4 croquettes at a time in the oil; let them turn golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper. If you like them more crunchy, bread the croquettes twice.\nAnd the croquettes are ready to be served nice and hot!

Good Luck!\n\nwrit of possession\n\nIn an eviction, after the long process of legal eviction, the last step is for the sheriff to forcibly remove a tenant from a property by physical force. This last step requires a writ of possession which is an order from the judge which is given to the sheriff to remove the tenant being evicted by force. In most cases, legal eviction does not come to this last step but ends somewhere prior to this last step. Most tenants realize that not paying rent means they have to leave the premises and it is more amenable to leave under one's one decision than to be hauled out by officers. Nonetheless, a writ of possession is the court permission for the sheriff to forcibly remove a tenant.\n\nMultiple Choice Question \n\nwrit of possession\nA convincing letter a buyer writes to force an owner to sell\nB court permission for sheriff to forcibly remove a tenant\nC to transfer or sell a property\nD right of a tenant to a property without paying rent\n\nCorrect Answer: b\n\nIf you would like to suggest corrections to this word, email us at actlevel42@gmail.com.

Having visited parts of this river on foot during the day it looked totally different at night with the neon lights reflecting in the water.  I've noticed over the years a lot of development in the area.  Although it's certainly more upscale and posh with new apartments, condos and boutique hotels, I feel it's lost some charm given that many of the traditional houses along the river (kampong) are now gone.  Overall, we enjoyed the boat ride and given it only cost 15 Ringgit ($5 USD) we'd recommend it to others visiting the city.\n\nThe Melaka River was once in a pretty nasty state, but the authorities realized its tourism potential and cleaned it up. A flotilla of small boats transports sightseers up and down past historic buildings, old warehouses (godowns), interesting mangrove stands, churches, and villages. The 1998 Sean Connery movie Entrapment was partially filmed here. Tours last about 45 minutes in boats ranging from 20- to 40-seaters, and normally a minimum of eight passengers is required before departure. Take a taxi to the jetty at Taman Rempah, about 20 minutes from Melaka town (about RM20). You can request beforehand to be dropped at the jetty beside the Maritime Museum instead of traveling back up river, but it's not advisable to take the boat from that jetty, as it's not a normal stop:  https://plus.google.com/105781362290527117725/about?hl=en\n\nMelaka River is a river which flows through the middle Malacca Town in the Malaysian state of Malacca. It was once an important trade route during the heyday of Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century. It has lost most of this function in the present and is a mere tourist attraction.\n\nWe have our tickets in hand and tonight we are going to be doing the Melaka River Cruise.\n\nThe city really lights up at night.\n\nI'm really enjoying this right now because I've actually only walked along this area.  I've never taken the boat and I've never done this at night so this is awesome.\n\nIt is so much easier and convenient taking the boat than walking.\n\nMy favorite part of the tour has been getting to see all of the art on the exterior of the buildings by the river.\n\nSince I first came here back in 2008 there has been a lot of development in the area.  There used to be a lot of traditional homes alongside the Kampong the river but not anymore.  Now there are boutique hotels and condos.  It has lost a little bit of its charm in my opinion.|\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Malaysia series.

Start shopping early in order to have more options and make sure it's available for rent on your wedding date.\n2. Ask about rental packages for wedding dresses: It doesn't make sense to purchase accessories for a dress you don't own. Try to find a head-to-toe package that includes veil, tiara, jewellery set and crinoline.\n3. Read the rental agreement carefully.\n4. When renting wedding dresses you also save money on alterations because simple alterations like taking in, hemming and bustle are already included in rental price.\n5.

(Bud) Selig announced on January 19, 2000, that the 30 Major League club owners voted unanimously to centralize all of Baseball's internet operations into an independent technology company. Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) was formed and charged with developing, building and managing the most comprehensive baseball experience available on the internet. In August 2002, MLB.com streamed the first-ever live, full length MLB game when the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees faced off at Yankee Stadium. Since that time, millions of baseball fans around the world have subscribed to MLB.TV, the live video streaming product that airs every game in HD to nearly 400 different devices. MLB.com also provides an array of mobile apps for fans to choose from, including At Bat, the highest-grossing iOS sports app of all-time. MLB.com features a stable of club beat reporters and award-winning national columnists, the largest contingent of baseball reporters under one roof, who deliver over 100 original articles every day. MLB.com also offers extensive historical information and footage, online ticket sales, official baseball merchandise, authenticated memorabilia and collectibles and fantasy games.\n \nMajor League Baseball consists of 30 teams split between the American and National Leagues. The American League, originally founded in 1901, consists of the following teams: Baltimore Orioles; Boston Red Sox; Chicago White Sox; Cleveland Indians; Detroit Tigers; Houston Astros; Kansas City Royals; Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; Minnesota Twins; New York Yankees; Oakland Athletics; Seattle Mariners; Tampa Bay Rays; Texas Rangers; and Toronto Blue Jays.

Garlic's antibacterial properties are also said to drive away colds\u2014but if you eat enough of it, you might be able to do both.\n\n\nStep 1: Loosen cloves\nPress down on the stem of a head of garlic to loosen the cloves.\n\nStep 2: Place clove\nPull one clove of garlic from the head and place it flat in the center of a clean cutting board.\n\nStep 3: Crack skin\nPlace the widest part of the flat side of your blade on top of the clove and smash down on the middle of it with the palm of your hand, taking care not to cut yourself. This will crack the papery skin enough for you to remove it.\n\nStep 4: Position knife\nGrasp the knife in your dominant hand, holding the handle close to the blade with three fingers: your middle, ring, and pinkie. Curl your forefinger around one side of the blade while holding your thumb on the opposite side.\n\nStep 5: Slice off root\nSlice off the root end of the garlic clove and discard it.\n\nStep 6: Slice clove\nKeeping the point of the knife on the board and using a steady rocking motion to slice\u2014not saw\u2014the garlic with the full length of the blade, slice the clove lengthwise into 4 or 5 slices. Then make 4 or 5 slices crosswise.\n\nTip\nFresh garlic is best used immediately, but you can store it in your refrigerator in an airtight container for up to two days.\n\nStep 7: Repeat process\nPull off another clove, crack and remove the skin, and slice away until you have all the garlic you need.\n\nDid You Know?\nGarlic and Shots, a restaurant in Stockholm and London, serves everything on the menu with garlic\u2014from garlic martinis to garlic honey ice cream.", "title": "How to Chop Garlic", "publishedDate": "2008-09-10T19:46:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Fg-ROmd8Do", "description": "Dr. Liette Vasseur from Brock University's Department of Biological Sciences answers the question \"What if we did nothing about invasive species?\"", "title": "What if we did nothing about invasive species?", "publishedDate": "2014-06-03T16:46:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Fg4k2_pWGY", "description": "Ranunculus repens its that buttercup that be creepin, taking over your whole neighbourhood while you and your ma are sleepin, its an evil demon spreading through seeds and stolons....

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \"sheep\" applies to many species, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over 1 billion, domestic sheep are the most numerous species in their genus.\n\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used of any animal, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.\n\nSheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.\n\nSheep-raising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word sc\u0113ap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob. Adult female sheep are referred to as ewes, intact males as rams or occasionally tups, castrated males as wethers, and younger sheep as lambs. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.\n\nBeing a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most-often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies\u2014such as the Golden Fleece\u2014and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.", "title": "Rams La Zoo", "publishedDate": "2010-06-09T07:37:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4FgNP7EcICk", "description": "", "title": "JDM Albizia with TURBO !!! 3/3", "publishedDate": "2012-11-26T19:35:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "4FgO0s7i-ec", "description": "Jeff Ward, RRT, a respiratory therapist at Mayo Clinic, demonstrates knot tying technique for securing endotracheal tubes (ETT) to prevent their displacement or accidental extubation.
