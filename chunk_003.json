Atlantic Arc of Europe.\n- CR\u00d3NICA: Una tortuga la\u00fad de varios cientos kilos de peso y en avanzado estado de descomposici\u00f3n apareci\u00f3, ayer jueves 5 de enero, en la zona oeste de la playa de Salinas, concejo de Castrill\u00f3n, Principado de Asturias, costa del mar Cant\u00e1brico. La Dermochelys Coriacea, conocida como tortuga la\u00fad, canal, baula o tinglar, es la mayor de todas las tortugas vivientes, alcanzando una longitud de 2 metros y un peso de m\u00e1s de 600 kilos. El record est\u00e1 en un macho de 916 kilos. El ejemplar encontrado en Salinas era un adulto de gran tama\u00f1o.\nLa tortuga la\u00fad es una especie en serio peligro de extinci\u00f3n. Una vez alcanzada la edad adulta sus mayores amenazas proceden de la actividad humana. Pueden ingerir o impregnarse accidentalmente pl\u00e1sticos, caucho, alquitr\u00e1n, aceite de motor, sustancias qu\u00edmicas, etc. Estos elementos pueden matarlas, enfermarlas o da\u00f1ar sus sistemas inmunol\u00f3gicas. Algunas mueren por colisiones con embarcaciones; pero su peor enemigo son las redes de pesca y anzuelos. El NOAA* estima que alrededor de 640 tortugas la\u00fad adultas son muertas cada a\u00f1o por las empresas de pesca comercial. Para una pesca m\u00e1s respetuosa existen los \"Dispositivos de Exclusi\u00f3n de Tortugas\", que en teor\u00eda son obligatorios y en teor\u00eda deber\u00edan funcionar bien; pero la realidad suele ser otra.\n+ M\u00c1S INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE OC\u00c9ANOS:\nhttp://www.asturiasverde.com/oceanos\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Asturias-Verde/319666207403 \nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/#!/asturiasverde", "title": "CR\u00d3NICA Tortuga gigante muerta en playa Salinas.

It typically inhabits sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters shallower than 60 m (200 ft), often burying itself in sediment. Usually measuring 45 cm (18 in) across, the common stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc slightly wider than long, and a whip-like tail with upper and lower fin folds. It can be identified by its plain coloration and mostly smooth skin, except for a row of tubercles along the midline of the back in the largest individuals.\nThe predominant prey of the common stingray are bottom-dwelling crustaceans, though it also takes molluscs, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are nourished by yolk and later histotroph (\"uterine milk\") produced by the mother. Females bear 4--9 young twice per year in shallow water, after a gestation period of four months. The common stingray can inflict a painful, though rarely life-threatening, wound with its venomous tail spine. During classical antiquity, its sting was ascribed many mythical properties.", "title": "Stingray / Raia", "publishedDate": "2010-06-05T01:37:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7GRuAWerVM", "description": "Complete Jurassic Park Ride!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO31qha0gLQ&feature=player_detailpage", "title": "Earthquake Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood", "publishedDate": "2014-01-11T12:58:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7GcseK-8tQ", "description": "http://braingenie.com", "title": "8.5.2 Peristalsis", "publishedDate": "2011-08-26T00:18:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7H5IWLTkIY", "description": "Opening for Whitehorse//Pneumatic Slaughter\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Vesicant", "title": "Vesicant - Dissension Hammer", "publishedDate": "2014-02-02T11:52:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7HBaLtVOhk", "description": "Animacje dla dzieci", "title": "Hotel Marabout Sousse Tunezja", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T16:34:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7HQqT4pIPE", "description": "Mr Fagus 2", "title": "Mr Fagus 2", "publishedDate": "2012-01-24T00:34:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7HRR8WFIVw", "description": "O NARIN \u00e9 um lavador nasal desenvolvido para aliviar sintomas variados associados \u00e0 rinite, sinusite, congest\u00e3o nasal, coriza e mal-estar nasal causado por resfriados.

For example if you have a spread sheet with addresses in it, you can use a product like Code-Point and within a GIS match the post code in the spread sheet to the postcode in Code-Point. You can then see where all your addresses are and see if there any clusters or gaps. You can then use the mapping to capture and create data from. For example school catchment areas. \n\nOnce the map data is within a GIS, you can then start to look at things spatially. For example, what is the distance between A and B? What is the area?

Warning, sodium hydroxide which we will use is corrosive and copper hydroxide is irritant, please wear gloves during the experiment.\nTe raction we will perform is the following: two molecule of sodium hydroxide plus copper sulphate pentahydrate produce sodium sulphate and copper two hydroxide. Now let's get started. Put some water in a beaker or in a glass container. I'm using distilled water. Now add about eight grams of copper suphate penthydrate. Mix until they will be completely dissolved. Now take a larger container and do the same thing, adding water and four grams of sodium hydroxide. Solve them like you've already done for the copper solution, Now with a siringe take a little bit of water from the light blue solution and add it to the second one. A blue precipitate of copper (II) hydroxide is forming istantly: infact while the sodium sulphate which forms is soluble into water the copper hydroxide is not soluble at all. If you want to separate the two compounds it is necessary to philtrate the solution. And now you have copper(II) hydroxide. As you can see it is a pale blue gelatinous solid and it's used especially in organic chemistry, like fungicide and occasionally as ceramic colorant.\nPlaese suscribe, rate and comment.", "title": "MAKING A COPPER HYDROXIDE PRECIPITATE.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-06-19T16:43:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-7f3yGtmor4", "description": "I want his babies.

La Sele\u00e7ao finit premi\u00e8re du groupe A et affrontera en 8es de finale de la Coupe du monde, le Chili.\n\n3e journ\u00e9e du Groupe A du Mondial :\nCameroun-Br\u00e9sil : 1-4\nButs : Matip (26e) - Neymar (16e, 35e), Fred (49e), Fernandinho (84e)\n\nC'est termin\u00e9 \u00e0 Brasilia. Le Br\u00e9sil termine en t\u00eate du groupe A apr\u00e8s cette victoire 4 \u00e0 1 face \u00e0 des Camerounais trop rarement dangereux. Le doubl\u00e9 de Neymar, le but de Fred et celui de Fernandinho ont eu raison de Lions Indomptables qui quittent la comp\u00e9tition avec trois d\u00e9faites.\n\nIl ne suffit pas d'avoir une grande \u00e9quipe pour remporter la Coupe du Monde. Comme l'avaient montr\u00e9 Zidane en 1998, Ronaldo en 2002 ou Cannavaro en 2006, un homme providentiel est souvent ce qui fait la diff\u00e9rence entre une \u00e9quipe qui termine bien plac\u00e9e et une \u00e9quipe qui termine championne.\n\nAu Br\u00e9sil, la hi\u00e9rarchie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie depuis longtemps : cet homme est Neymar. Les fr\u00eales \u00e9paules de l'ailier barcelonais doivent faire avec la pression de toute une nation. Arborant le num\u00e9ro 10 mythique de la Selecao, il doit jouer son jeu en faisant abstraction des attentes de 200 millions de Br\u00e9siliens et de la virulence des onze adversaires auxquels il fait face.\n\nD\u00e8s la 3\u00e8me minute, son d\u00e9calage dans l'intervalle trouve Hulk sur la droite. Le centre de l'ailier du Zenith Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg ne trouve pas Fred, souvent trop \u00e9mouss\u00e9 dans la surface adverse.\n\nQu'importe, puisque les Br\u00e9siliens n'ont pas l'attaquant de pointe de classe mondiale auxquels ils sont en droit de s'attendre, c'est Neymar qui prend ses responsabilit\u00e9s.\n\nAu quart d'heure de jeu, sur une sortie de balle anodine, la star br\u00e9silienne est pouss\u00e9e dans le dos par Nyom sans raison. Il termine sa course parmi les nombreux photographes qui, m\u00eame lorsqu'il est \u00e0 l'autre bout du terrain, n'ont d'yeux que pour lui.\n\nDeux minutes plus tard, il apporte la meilleure des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 cette provocation en se trouvant parfaitement \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception d'un centre du pr\u00e9cieux Luiz Gustavo qui r\u00e9cup\u00e8re et percute sur l'aile gauche. L'ailier du Bar\u00e7a conclut et, croit-on, lance son \u00e9quipe sur la bonne voie (1-0, 15\u00e8me).\n\nC'est pourtant le Cameroun qui se met en \u00e9vidence apr\u00e8s ce but et prend progressivement le dessus dans la partie. Une occasion du Lorientais Aboubakar sonne la r\u00e9volte, avant que la f\u00e9brilit\u00e9 br\u00e9silienne sur coup de pied arr\u00eat\u00e9 ne soit mise en exergue lorsque Nyom prend le dessus sur Dani Alves et centre fort pour une reprise \u00e0 bout portant du jeune d\u00e9fenseur central Joel Matip, mont\u00e9 pour un corner pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (1-1, 26\u00e8me).\n\nLes Br\u00e9siliens bafouillent leur jeu collectif et s'en remettent \u00e0 des \u00e9clairs de leur g\u00e9nie Neymar. Juste apr\u00e8s la demi-heure de jeu, sur une passe de Marcelo, il repique dans l'axe et inscrit un but salvateur (2-1, 34\u00e8me).\n\nLib\u00e9r\u00e9s, les Br\u00e9siliens d\u00e9butent la deuxi\u00e8me mi-temps pleine de bonne volont\u00e9. Bien que leur construction en phase offensive soit rarement syst\u00e9matique, et trop souvent le fait d'une inspiration individuelle, les hommes de Luis Felipe Scolari prennent le dessus dans la partie.\n\nUne poign\u00e9e de minutes apr\u00e8s la reprise, sur un bon travail de Fernandinho ponctu\u00e9 d'un centre de David Luiz, c'est Fred en position de hors-jeu qui met les siens \u00e0 l'abri de la t\u00eate (3-1, 49\u00e8me).\n\nLe rythme du match diminue ensuite jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'en fin de match, et alors que le score en faveur du Mexique face \u00e0 la Croatie met en p\u00e9ril la premi\u00e8re place br\u00e9silienne dans le groupe A, Fernandinho se charge de rassurer son \u00e9quipe apr\u00e8s un tr\u00e8s bon une-deux avec Fred ainsi qu'un bon mouvement d'Oscar (4-1, 84\u00e8me).\n\nSi cette rencontre n'a toujours pas permis de mettre en \u00e9vidence un syst\u00e8me collectif suffisamment bien huil\u00e9 c\u00f4t\u00e9 br\u00e9silien, il a mis en lumi\u00e8re les aptitudes de l'homme providentiel Neymar tout en rassurant les observateurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s de Fred, buteur sur le troisi\u00e8me but et acteur d\u00e9cisif du quatri\u00e8me. Il a \u00e9galement montr\u00e9 que le Br\u00e9sil a, avec Fernandinho ou Willian, une densit\u00e9 de talent sur le banc qui sera certainement cruciale pour la suite de la comp\u00e9tition.", "title": "Buts, Cameroun vs Br\u00e9sil  (1-4) - Coupe du Monde 23.6.2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-23T22:19:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "-85ubSkzSWg", "description": "The Time Traveler's Wife Movie Clip - watch all clips http://j.mp/A9MsoG\nclick to subscribe http://j.mp/sNDUs5\n\nHenry (Eric Bana) comes back with some future lottery ticket numbers and he wins five million dollars.\n\nTM & \u00a9 Warner Bros.

Those panels feature better than factory alignment and the cars paint, which has been wet sanded and polished to a perfect shine, displays no visible defects. The combination of excellent panel alignment and Kansas flat body panels suggest that this Biscayne was completely disassembled during its recent restoration and that many labor intensive hours were likely spent making sure it received top notch finish work. All that time and hard work paid off handsomely because it's one of the finest old school Chevrolets I've seen in a very long time.\n \nMechanically, this Biscayne is all business. Under the hood you'll find a newly rebuilt 396 cubic inch V8 that has been bored .030 over to 402 cubic inches of fire breathing power. Factory rated at 375 horsepower it has no problem carrying this relatively light Chevy down the road just as fast as you want to go. At the top of the engine, a correct dual snorkel air cleaner wears a chrome lid, smooth satin black paint and a proper \"396 Turbo Jet\" decal. Below that air cleaner, a high performance 4 barrel carburetor sends fuel from stainless fuel lines into a correct Chevrolet Orange intake. At the sides of that intake, good looking Chevrolet Orange valve covers sit above correct cast iron exhaust manifolds that, despite a bit of rust look clean and solid. At the back of the engine, a correct points distributor sends power into correct 7MM black suppression wires, and in front of the engine, a heavy duty radiator sits below a correct fan shroud and circulates water through fresh black hoses. \n \nBacking up the 402 cubic inch big block is an unbreakable TH400 3-speed transmission that sends power to a rebuilt rear end with tall but highway friendly 3.42 gears. During the restoration the cars original double A-arm front and 3 link rear suspension was completely rebuilt and features new air shocks out back and retrofitted power steering up front. Braking is handled by a new firewall mounted brake booster and master cylinder that sends fluid to new drilled and slotted front discs brakes and correct and completely rebuilt rear drums. Exhaust flows through a 2.5 inch true dual system that is complete with stainless steel pipes and high performance mufflers. Above the suspension rust free floorpans are covered in a thin coat of protective undercoating and all lines, hoses, brackets and fasteners, which were completely replaced at the time of restoration, show little to no weathering. At the corners of the car, chrome 18 inch front and 20 inch rear Coys wheels wear 255/35 Ventus Sport Z-rated radials that look good and grip great.\n \nThis Biscayne's fully restored correct GM code 883 blue interior features dynamic blue plaid seats that were fully rebuilt during the cars restoration and are both cool and comfortable. Below the seats, new blue carpet is properly fitted to the floors and shows no weathering or signs of damage at all. At the top of the car, a light blue headliner is stretched behind a chrome trimmed dome light and awesome two-tone sun visors. At the front of the car, a simple painted blue dash features a correct radio delete, chrome controls for the cars heater and accessories, and hangs an Equus three pack gauge pod that keeps an accurate eye on the big block engine In front of the driver, a horizontal speedometer sits in front of a column mounted shifter and a correct blue steering wheel that features bright chrome trim around a very cool Bel Air horn button.   \n\nThis 1961 Chevrolet Biscayne is one of the last great no nonsense, no frills designs to come out of Detroit, and it's the kind of car that your family can enjoy for generations.", "title": "132578 / 1961 Chevrolet Biscayne", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T22:29:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-8CxTe97SY8", "description": "The public is being tested in this social experiment about racism.

Nasal congestion. For people with chronic sinus problems, it may feel like you have a cold that will never go away. Todd Wade has been suffering from chronic sinus infections for 10 years. He made an appointment to see Dr. Charles Katz, an Ears, Nose and Throat Specialist at Alta View Hospital. Dr. Katz decided surgery would be the best option.Many people will associate sinus problems with allergies. Dr. Katz says that is not always the case. So some are associated with allergies, but there are other people who have nasal polyps or just narrowed openings in-between the sinuses in the nose, or other inflammatory conditions.Before surgery is considered, doctors will first try medications. They will also do a CT scan to get a better idea of what is going on in the sinuses. If doctors decide to do surgery, they will use the CT scans to help them navigate through the sinus cavity. The surgery takes a few hours and patients will go home the same day. Todd Wade had no reservations about the surgery, despite some horror stories he heard. Lots of people warned me beforehand and said it was a horrible surgery; lots of pain; it doesnt always work. And they were wrong.If you have chronic sinus problems, be sure to see your doctor. A quick note about the popular over-the-counter medication Afrin. Afrin is a nasal spray you can purchase at the store. Doctor Katz says a lot of people will get addicted to Afrin, which can cause more damage.

The entire procedure usually takes less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe most important and greatest success achieved with the use of cervical steroid injections is the rapid relief of symptoms which allow you to become active again.With this pain relief, you often regain the ability to resume normal daily activities and engage in physical therapy.\n\nFor more information about cervical epidural steroid injections, check out ArizonaPain.com. \n\nDon't delay.

However, his older brother, singer Paul D. \"HR\" Hudson does have a Feb. b-day (2/11/56), according to all sources - which may mean something. Or not. As vet fans know: it's Bad Brains, w/ HR; attendant degrees of uncertainty are a given. See \"**DATE DOUBT\" in comments below for add'l info.] \nThis take of this \"...Damn Song\" - a number defined by its emphatically declamatory delivery of its cogent, spot-on, pop-cultural analysis & complex, multi-strata socio-political/ philosophical message - is the only known live version. And it's apparently the only other vers. available besides its sole studio version: titled \"Just Another Damn Song,\" recorded in June of 1979, by Don Zientara @ his Inner Ear studio in Arlington, VA. Said June '79 version would not be officially released until 1996 (w/ other session tracks), as the archival album Black Dots. (BTW & IMHO: ANY serious Bad Brains enthusiast not owning Black Dots should hasten to purchase said document a.s.a.p.; not only is it essential BB material but, presumably, as it was released in '96, it pro'ly [a hunch] generates some far more accurate/efficient royalty payments than other scattered 'Brains releases over the years, allowing the actual, richly deserving artists to get paid.) \nNOTE: The Black Dots June '79 vers., @ 1:47 long (of music), seems more articulated than this earlier (?) February (?) '79 vers., true. But @ only 1:34 long (of music), this version's blistering played-live speed just may represent Bad Brains at their very fastest - here, shaving some 13 secs. off the studio-take of what's already a short song. Supporting evidence for this possibility includes doing HR vox comparisons on songs in common w/ other early live recordings - e.g., @ CB's in later '79; @ Madam's Organ (D.C.) in March '80; even the now widely available  Dec. '82 @ CBGB's CD/ DVD releases (none w/ \"...Damn Song\") - which suggest that this Max's set may be as authentically fast as it sounds in parts - i.e., that any speeding up from the source tape/recording (or via later dubbing/transfer process) is insignificant. Tellingly, the overall Max's perf is marked by a particularly wild, explosive energy, Which: a) makes some readings of now-familiar Bad Brains classics sound kinda raw & def'ly less honed than later (even by mere mos.) versions; But: b) makes 'em rather exceptionally thrilling in their fresh & fiery, careening bravado ... & further proves Bad Brains as easily among the most exciting acts in Rock (@ the least) Music History. No romanticization about it - the proof exists, to crank up & hear ...\n \n(Further: According to a few sources, Bad Brains moved from their D.C. homebase to NYC in later '79, where they recorded \"Pay To Cum\" in December [eventually their debut single]. This \"...Damn Song,\" howev, may've been left behind/ dropped from their live sets, as no further recordings of it are found. There's \"pro\" vid of Bad Brains in [presumably later] '79 @ CBGB's, which includes a # of [presumably newer?] songs not found on the 17-track Feb. '79 @ Max's KC boot - classics like \"Sailin' On\" et al. - which may've, by then, replaced earlier material [heard on Black Dots], like \"...Damn Song.\")", "title": "Bad Brains - \"[Just] Another Damn Song\" (Live in NYC, Max's KC, Feb.

Shy bladder syndrome, or parauresis, simply refers to the inability - or reduced ability - to urinate in public, in the company of others. In milder cases, a man might have trouble using a public urinal in a busy venue - such as a sports arena - while in more severe cases, men might be so limited that social events and even long plane rides are out of the question. \n\nClearly, this issue can severely impair a man's ability to participate in regular activities - imagine trying to get through a long day at work without the ability to void the bladder. \n\nDealing with this problem can lead to some significant consequences for a man's emotional health, relationships, and even his penis health. One thing that men who are affected should know is that they are not alone - an estimated 7 percent of the population experiences this problem, putting the number of individuals with parauresis in the tens of millions.\n\nUrologists cite two common reasons explaining the causes of shy bladder syndrome. The first is physical. Under normal circumstances, the bladder contracts after filling up, making urination quite easy. When drinks are consumed, the bladder begins to fill up, stretching the organ. \n\nThe additional pressure from all this stretching makes it much more difficult to begin urinating. Alcoholic drinks can exacerbate the issue, as they tend to make the prostate gland swell. This can also block the flow of urine from the bladder. Older men are especially prone to this situation, as they may have enlarged prostates to begin with.\n\nThe second cause is psychological and has more to do with conventional shyness, as opposed to shy bladder syndrome. In short, many times men are uncomfortable urinating in public in front of other men. This is especially evident at large public gatherings, like concerts or sporting events, where privacy is not exactly guaranteed.\n\nLearn more about your paruresis, what causes a shy or bashful bladder, and what you can do to help stop the anxiety that can make it virtually IMPOSSIBLE to urinate, no matter how hard you try!\n\nThe Paruresis Treatment System is a comprehensive set of resources developed with professionals, designed to help you quickly understand, confront, and overcome your paruresis or shy bladder with the convenience, privacy, and affordability of an at-home system.

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "Man eats a living octopus", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:08:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-8nPr0DVpvQ", "description": "Dr CARRO Dica luz de oleo acendendo bomba oleo borranomotor pescador entupido lubrifica\u00e7\u00e3o.

I have more Pinterest #FAILS than successes. Still.. it's Autumn. This time of year just calls out to the craftiness in my genes.\n\nBut this time -- I wanted my dear husband to give it a try. I found a great wreath I wanted to duplicate -- and of course, there were no step by step instructions. Of course.\n\nSo here's his first try at a Pinterest craft. You have to watch until the end. Classic.\n\nHave more crafts he should try?

In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells (these are called pluripotent cells), but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.\n\nThere are three accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:\n\n    Bone marrow, which requires extraction by harvesting, that is, drilling into bone (typically the femur or iliac crest),\n    Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which requires extraction by liposuction, and\n    Blood, which requires extraction through pheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.\n\nStem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.\n\nHighly plastic adult stem cells are routinely used in medical therapies, for example in bone marrow transplantation. Stem cells can now be artificially grown and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves through cell culture. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through therapeutic cloning have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.[1] Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto in the 1960s.[2][3] Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia.

Instead, it was his successor at the club, Gordon Strachan, who enjoyed the happier homecoming.\nAnother of the pre-match talking points was the expected booing of the Scots-born Ireland winger Aiden McGeady and his reception was suitably hostile - he was treated by the home fans as the pantomime villain.\nFrom the outset, the pace of the game was frenetic. The tackling was tenacious and, at times, downright careless, leading to early bookings for Hanley, McGeady and his Ireland team-mate, Jeff Hendrick.\nThe passion on show almost made up for the dearth of football, with precious few chances created in the opening half-hour.\nJon Walters and Darron Gibson did force David Marshall into saves, but there was little to worry either goalkeeper.", "title": "Scotland 1-0 Republic of Ireland Goal &HighLights(Euro Qualifiers 14/11/2014) HD", "publishedDate": "2014-11-14T22:19:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9371TVhjKY", "description": "Get ready to drum your way to a rock hard body!

Dr. Paul is the leading spokesman in Washington for limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies based on commodity-backed currency. He is known among both his colleagues in Congress and his constituents for his consistent voting record in the House of Representatives: Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Dr. Paul is the \"one exception to the Gang of 535\u2033 on Capitol Hill.\n\nRon Paul was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, before proudly serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s. He and his wife Carol moved to Texas in 1968, where he began his medical practice in Brazoria County. As a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology, Dr. Paul has delivered more than 4,000 babies! He and Carol, who reside in Lake Jackson, Texas, are the proud parents of five children and have eighteen grandchildren.\n\nWhile serving in Congress during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dr. Paul's limited-government ideals were not popular in Washington. He served on the House Banking committee, where he was a strong advocate for sound monetary policy and an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve's inflationary measures. He also was a key member of the Gold Commission, advocating a return to a gold standard for our currency. He was an unwavering advocate of pro-life and pro-family values. Dr. Paul consistently voted to lower or abolish federal taxes, spending, and regulation, and used his House seat to actively promote the return of government to its proper constitutional levels. In 1984, he voluntarily relinquished his House seat and returned to his medical practice.\n\nDr. Paul returned to Congress in 1997 to represent the 14th Congressional district of Texas. He serves on the House Financial Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee. On the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Paul serves as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology. He continues to advocate a dramatic reduction in the size of the federal government and a return to constitutional principles.\n\nDr. Paul is the author of several books, including The Revolution: A Manifesto, End the Fed, Liberty Defined, Challenge to Liberty; The Case for Gold; and A Republic, If You Can Keep It. He has been a distinguished counselor to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and is widely quoted by scholars and writers in the fields of monetary policy, banking, and political economy. He has received many awards and honors during his career in Congress, from organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Council for a Competitive Economy, and countless others.\n\nDr. Paul's consistent voting record prompted one Congressman to comment that \"Ron Paul personifies the Founding Fathers' ideal of the citizen-statesman. He makes it clear that his principles will never be compromised, and they never are.\" Another Congresswoman added that \"There are few people in public life who, through thick and thin, rain or shine, stick to their principles. Ron Paul is one of those few.\"\n\nExtra TAGS\n\nron paul \"ron paul\" \"ron paul 2012\" \"ron paul debate\" \"peter schiff\" \"alex jones\" \"ron paul revolution\" \"bill maher\" \"ron paul speech\" \"ron paul cnn\" \"rick perry\" \"ron paul obama\" \"ron pual\" \"jesse ventura\" \"ron paul interview\" \"jon stewart\" \"glenn beck\" \"ron paul iowa\" \"barack obama\" \"Mitt Romney\" \"ron Paul\" Iowa Minnesota Mitt Romney republican obama  \"Barack Obama\"", "title": "Mitchell - Ron Paul Supporters are True Believers 05 - 15 - 2012.", "publishedDate": "2012-05-18T02:51:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-99VuDxOkNI", "description": "Watch Out !\nSt.319 finally back to the hood with a new dance cover video. \n\"RED LIGHT\" - a very electro-house and very reminiscent new-track from f(x) asks you to stop and take a listen. \nLet's enjoy those strong moves with the St.319's version of RED LIGHT!\n\nMuch Love.", "title": "Red Light - f(x) (\uc5d0\ud504\uc5d1\uc2a4) Dance Cover by St.319 from Vietnam", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T13:09:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "-99epVQuAKk", "description": "The one where Mama loses all of her blood.\n\nSee more http://www.collegehumor.com\nLIKE us on: http://www.facebook.com/collegehumor\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.twitter.com/collegehumor\nFOLLOW us on: http://www.collegehumor.tumblr.com", "title": "Precious Plum: A Blood Drive (Ep. 8)", "publishedDate": "2013-11-14T22:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "-99xHj0dm8I", "description": "La barra de nuevo demostrando toda su fiesta despu\u00e9s de ocho a\u00f1os de ausencia del Deportivo Cali en Copa Libertadores.", "title": "Frente Radical Verdiblanco | Copa Libertadores | Deportivo Cali 1-0 Cerro Porte\u00f1o | 12 Febrero 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T02:20:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9A-y5L7few", "description": "This is an official entry for the Xtranormal Summer Movie Contest, done\nby pauli9363.

It is a variety of nightblooming Cereus and often confused with species of Selenicereus.\n\nNative to Central America and Northern South America,the Kadupul flower blooms rarely and only at night -- mysteriously, the flower wilts before dawn. In 1909, C. A. Purpus collected a slightly different type in St. Ana, Orizaba, Mexico. It has carmine red outer petals and the flowers have an unpleasant smell, rather than being fragrant. It was originally named Phyllocactus purpusii, but does probably not deserve any botanical recognition. The Chinese chengyu (four character idiom)(tan hua yi xian) uses this flower (tan-hua;) to describe someone who has an impressive but very brief moment of glory, like a \"flash in a pan\", since the flower can take a year to bloom and only blooms over a single night. Therefore someone described as \"\u66c7\u82b1\u4e00\u73fe\" is generally understood to be a person who shows off or unexpectedly gains some achievement and is thought to be an exception or only lucky. The flower also has a rich history in Japan, where it is known as the (Gekka Bijin) or \"Beauty under the Moon\"\nIt can be found from Mexico to Venezuela, as well as Brazil. It also can be found, cultivated in parts of America with warmer temperature such as Texas or California. Epiphytic or lithophytic. 75-2.000 m alt. Widely cultivated and escaped in many places and its true origin has never been fully understood. Linked to the Legend of \"BAKAWALI\" in most S.E. Asian countries.\nAn easily cultivated, fast growing Epiphyllum . It needs compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. It should not be kept under 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) in winter. It can be grown in semi-shade or full sun. Extra light in the early spring will stimulate budding. It flowers in late spring or early summer; large specimens can produce several crops of flowers in a season. This is the most commonly grown of the Epiphyllum species, and it is known under several common names including Night-blooming Cereus, Dutchman's Pipe, Queen of the Night, Wijaya Kusuma (Indonesian), (Nishagandhi in Hindi and Marathi), Gul-e-Bakavali (in Urdu) and  (Kadupul in Sinhala). \nStems erect, ascending, scandent or sprawling, profusely branched, primary stems terete, to 2--6 m long, flattened laterally, ligneous at base, secondary stems flat, elliptic-acuminate, to 30 cm x 10--12 cm, thin; margins shallowly to deeply crenate and \u00b1 undulate. Flowers produced from flattened portions, to 30 cm long, 12--17 cm wide, nocturnal, very fragrant. The principal odor component in the aroma is benzyl salicylate; pericarpel nude, slightly angled, green, bracteoles short; receptacle 13--20 cm long, 1 cm thick, brownish, arching, bracteoles narrow, ca 10 mm long; outer tepals linear, acute, 8--10 cm long reddish to amber; inner tepals oblanceolate to oblong, acuminate, to 8--10 cm long and 2,5 cm wide, whitish; stamens greenish white or white, slender and weak; style greenish white or white, 4 mm thick, as long as inner tepals, lobes many, pale yellow or white. Fruit oblong, 12 x 8 cm, purplish red, angled.\n\nCopyrights : MrZygy3", "title": "Amazing Queen of The Night Time Lapse Part IV", "publishedDate": "2012-12-29T16:48:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9KbKeaQu3c", "description": "Lego Stop Motion animated fun!

Those innocents know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is Traitor and who is not.\n\nThe Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment, if they are to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive, which means finding out who the Traitors are and killing them before they kill you. Of course everyone is holding a big gun, and everyone looks suspicious...\n\nFor the Innocent, knowledge is power: who is acting strangely? Who can be linked to evidence found on corpses?

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "old asian couple eat a living octopus in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:20:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9TPMffb9cY", "description": "Bulldozer in Minecraft(No Mods)\ntutorial\n\nHey guys its DrDimonds and today i am giving you guys an awesome game play so hope you enjoy :D\n\nThe music is from freestockmusic.com and is 100% royalty free.\n\nMy Minecraft skin: http://tinyurl.com/ck8hw23\n\n-==DONATE==-\nhttp://tinyurl.com/czpjwn2\n\n-==Twitter==-\nhttps://twitter.com/DrDimonds\n\n-==Facebook==-\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DrDimonds?ref=hl", "title": "Minecraft Mini Creations - Bulldozer Tutorial(No Mods)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T02:08:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9TcUVL3yrI", "description": "Works ongoing at the site of the Khone Larn rapid fish bypass channel.

Nemcoff\nIt might have been the other side of the moon. In 1960, Dhaka (then known as 'Dacca'), East Pakistan (now known as Bangladesh) was, for all practical purposes, almost that far removed from the consciousness of the American people. Geographically, it was certainly on the other side of the world globe from American cities like Chicago or Philadelphia, for example. In the late '50s and early '60s, any news emanating from that part of the world was considered pretty far out.\n\nAmidst the political intrigue and social upheaval that was further complicated by the Cold War in the early sixties, Barry Nemcoff, a former news reporter from Philadelphia, arrived in Dacca, East Pakistan with his wife and infant children in tow on an assignment with the U. S. Information Agency. The purpose of the agency's work: To tell America's story, spread its technical and scientific know-how, and contribute to the development of a nation.\n\nWhat follows are the recollections of one ordinary American citizen who spent two years on the subcontinent, literally plucked out of American society and thrust, almost overnight, into a strange culture whose language and way of life was as esoteric to him and his family as anything coming out of fiction.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBARRY R. NEMCOFF spent the Second World War serving on a minesweeper and became a newspaperman after graduating from Temple University. A CBS Fellowship under Edward R. Murrow would propel him on a television news career that took him from news director at WCAU in Philiadelphia to \"Good Morning America\" and then later becoming ABC News' Chicago Bureau Chief where he would launch \"World News Tonight\" with Frank Reynolds, Max Robinson and Peter Jennings. After winning a Cine Golden Eagle for his documentary on Alaskan sled dogs, he was appointed Assistant Dean of Communications at his alma mater. Eventually, he would return to television, later retiring as the Executive Producer of PBS' \"Nightly Business Report.\"", "title": "Barry Nemcoff Tells a Story from His Time in Dacca", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15T20:26:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9_rplHuA_8", "description": "Dal:Satanic Warmaster - Blessed Be The Grim Arts\nAlbum:Carelian Satanist Madness\n\u00c9v:2005", "title": "Kezdj\u00fcnk bele...", "publishedDate": "2012-08-06T20:20:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-9aWPhDgCOg", "description": "This strategy will allow you to defeat The Destroyer in just a couple of minuets.

Nothing can stop me from loving such a great series. \nCome to think of it, my need to put a distance between myself and high fantasy is closely connected with Tolkien. When the genre is discussed in a western context, his name always pops up, and that's the issue. The last time I liked \"Lord of the Rings\" was when I was 10. Now I tend to associate his writings with precise, elaborate world-building that overshadows all other aspects of the work, and a number of worldview-related elements (\"good vs evil\" morality, impersonality, \"heroism\", destiny-centrism, na\u00efvet\u00e9) that I find absolutely unpleasant. It's because of this that sometimes high fantasy triggers a strong reaction from me, like \"Yeah, I like some, for example [anime title], BUT NOT THE THING IN GENERAL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TOLKIEN\".

St\u00f3ri Eldrunni.   - Ro\u00f0arunnaepli - Japanspera - \n\nChaenomeles is a genus of three species of deciduous spiny shrubs, usually 1--3 m tall, in the family Rosaceae. They are native to eastern Asia in Japan, China and Korea. These plants are related to the quince (Cydonia oblonga) and the Chinese quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis), differing in the serrated leaves, and in the flowers having deciduous sepals and styles that are connate at the base. Although all quince species have flowers, gardeners in the West often refer to these species as \"flowering quince\", since Chaenomeles are grown ornamentally for their flowers, not for their fruits. These plants have also been called \"Japanese quince\", and the name \"japonica\" (referring to C. japonica) was widely used for these plants in the 19th and 20th centuries, although this common name is not particularly distinctive, since japonica is a specific epithet shared by many other plants. The names \"japonica\" or \"Japanese quince\" were (and still are) often loosely applied to Chaenomeles in general, regardless of their species. The most commonly cultivated Chaenomeles referred to as \"japonica\" are actually the hybrid C. \u00d7 superba and C. speciosa; C. japonica itself is not as commonly grown. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaenomeles \n\nChaenomeles japonica is a species of Japanese Quince. It is a thorny deciduous shrub that is commonly cultivated. It is shorter than another commonly cultivated species C. speciosa, growing to only about 1 m in height. The fruit is called Kusa-boke  in Japanese. It is best known for its colorful spring flowers of red, white, pink or multi. It produces apple-shaped fruit that are a golden-yellow color containing red-brown seeds. The fruit is edible but hard, and not as well known for its jelly and pie making as its cousin Cydonia.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as Cavia aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\n\nThe guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies. Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.\n\nIn Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, their responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.\n\nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as a model organism in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet \"guinea pig\" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.", "title": "Crazy Guinea Pig", "publishedDate": "2012-08-23T18:51:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AAhtf0RL8w", "description": "", "title": "NYC cabs for german project", "publishedDate": "2010-11-22T03:17:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AAn8szxTdg", "description": "In just three years, the Kilkenny Arts Festival Choir has established itself as one of the must-see events in our annual programme, drawing packed crowds to St Canice's for its spectacular end-of-festival performances, and this year's choir is our biggest yet.

Descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the ghost of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a s\u00e9ance.\n\nThe belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices\u2014funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic\u2014are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life, though stories of phantom armies, ghost trains, phantom ships, and even ghost animals have also been recounted.\n\n\nDimond Center in Anchorage. This mall is allegedly haunted by spectral Native Americans.\n\n\nDimond Center is a shopping mall in Anchorage, Alaska, United States. At 728,000 ft\u00b2 (67,000 m\u00b2), it is the largest mall in the state of Alaska. It is located at the intersection of East Dimond Boulevard and the Old Seward Highway.\n\nThe mall is anchored by Best Buy and Forever 21 and contains over 200 stores, restaurants, and offices, the latter located in a six-story office tower. Other facilities include the Samson-Dimond Branch Library (closed), the Regal Dimond 9 Cinemas, and a lower level in the office tower that contains a small food court, a bowling alley, and an athletic club, all arrayed around an ice skating rink.\n\n\nHistory:\n\nThe road from Anchorage to the Potter section of the Alaska Railroad became the Seward Highway in the early 1950s and the Old Seward Highway about 20 years later with the construction of a 4-lane freeway slightly to the east. The Old Seward Highway formed the backbone of what became south Anchorage, both in terms of access to residential subdivisions and homesteads, as well as businesses which catered to both nearby residents and highway travelers.\n\nAs south Anchorage began to grow, the intersections of the Old Seward Highway with Dowling Road and with O'Malley Road originally began to develop as commercial hubs. This began to change as Larry Carr and Barney Gottstein acquired and subsequently developed large amounts of acreage throughout Anchorage, mostly with intent to expand the Carr's grocery chain. Their initial foray into south Anchorage occurred at the corner of Dimond and Old Seward, just north of the Dimond Center. This turned what was originally intended as industrial land into retail land, no doubt helped by the development boom associated with the trans-Alaska pipeline.\n\nDimond Center opened in 1977 with Safeway and Pay 'n Save as its anchor stores. It underwent a major expansion in 1981, adding a replacement Pay 'n Save drug store and other stores. A refrigerant leak in 1991 resulted in the death of a maintenance worker. 1996 saw the addition of a movie theater.\n\nhttp://dorsetghostinvestigators.tv/haunted-usa/dimond-center-in-anchorage-haunted-alaska/\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE & JOIN THE D.G.I FAMILY. \n\nPlease follow us on twitter at https://twitter.com/DorsetghostDGI\n& like our facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Dorset-Ghost-Investigators/259833150723729\n\n\nMusic credit to:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\".\nLicensed under Creative Commons \n\"Attribution 3.0\" \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\nLicence for Images in video:\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License\nThis file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.", "title": "Real Ghosts & Haunting!

The schematic diagram and technical explanation will be in the next video. We'll still string along with H.P. Blavatsky's opinion that the power for Keeley's fuelless motor was his own ectoplasm, and that Hendershot, like Keeley, was a natural magician. But that's an opinion after all, and the facts, I hope, will be brought out by further research. Another Associate, the late J. Gilbert E. Wright detailed his efforts to get technical information through mediums in the BSRA brochure \"Two Inventors Return\" \u2014 Edison and Steinmetz, mimeo.\nII.\n\nThis man, Lester J. Hendershot, was an amazing individual when compared to men with technical abilities acquired by normal education. His native intelligence was extremely high. Charles Fort was certainly correct when he included Hendershot among the rare individuals that have Wild Talents.\n\nHis ability to perform technical feats by intuition was developed to a high degree. As an example: If he wished to build an electrical coil that would operate in a circuit at a resonant frequency of say 500 KG, he would go to an electronic supply store, pick out a spool of wire from the supply racks, take it home and wind a coil on a form which would turn out to measure in a resonant circuit, 500 Kilocycles. He was able to consistently achieve this phenomena, and as a result of it created a fuelless generator that would produce electrical power.\n\nFrom: Zero Point Energy - A Story of Free Energy Part 4", "title": "Zero Point Energy - A Story of Free Energy Part 4", "publishedDate": "2013-11-18T16:04:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AIdYoMpINQ", "description": "Great live version of \"Ain`t no thang\", performed ON Nidelva in Trondheim, Norway.\nCopyright NRK / P3tv , 2008.", "title": "Katzenjammer performs live \"Ain`t no thang\"", "publishedDate": "2008-08-26T11:51:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AJpxG9PYG4", "description": "Osu! is free to play!

Males are generally solitary and only associate with other elephants during the mating season.  Males compete for access to estrus females and older, more dominant males generally mate with more females.  Males experience \"musth,\" a hormonal state marked by increased aggression.  During this period, the male secretes a fluid from the temporal gland between the eye and ear.\n\nOne of the characteristics that distinguish the forest elephant from the savanna elephant is its straighter, downward - projecting tusks.  Their tusks are teeth; the second set of incisors become the tusks.  Unlike Asian elephants, in which only males have tusks, both male and female African elephants are tusked.  The tusks continue to grow throughout the elephant's lifetime.   Sadly, due to the hunting pressure on tusked animals brought about by poaching for ivory, fewer and fewer large tuskers are seen.\n\nThis camera trap footage was a result of a joint 1 year project by the Panafrican Research and Monitoring Program at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, The US Fish and Wildlife Service, and The Lukuru Foundation, with additional funding provided by The Lucie Burgers Foundation for Comparative Behavior Research, Arnhem, The Netherlands, The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Amsterdam, and The African Wildlife Foundation. Cleve Hicks led the survey mission and Karsten Dierks served as Panafrican Team Leader in charge of the camera trap project.

As you can see in the video despite requesting the paperwork in a calm manner he accuses his client of getting his 'knickers in a twist' this was in front of a waiting room full of people. He also says the paperwork will take to long to collect but when the client asks if he should return later mr Grant reaches into a basket on the counter and takes out paperwork and signs it. These documents were of a personal nature and left lying on a counter, apart from claiming they were not ready (more lies) I find it irresponsible to leave documents like this lying around in plain view. finally the reason this client wanted his file back was because mr Grant refused to speak to the client about his case until legal aid was obtained, mr Grant claimed to be dealing with acquiring legal aid but on contacting the legal aid board it was discovered that they had received no application regarding the case from mr Grant.

It is an anise-flavored spirit derived from herbs, including the flowers and leaves of the herb Artemisia absinthium, commonly referred to as \"grande wormwood\". Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but can also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \"la f\u00e9e verte\" (the Green Fairy).\n\nToday it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations. Thujone, the active chemical in absinthe, occurs naturally in two forms (\u2212)-\u03b1-thujone and (+)-\u03b2-thujone. The two types of thujones are GABA antagonists; and while they can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no evidence that they cause hallucinations. It has been speculated that reports of hallucinogenic effects of absinthe may have been due to chemicals being added to cheaper versions of the drink in the 19th century, to give it a more vivid color.\n\nMore info on Absinthe: http://www.neurosoup.com/absinthe.htm", "title": "How to Mix a Traditional Absinthe Drink", "publishedDate": "2011-08-26T19:16:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "-A_NWDP_2Lw", "description": "Made by a Fan.\nQuinn Wentz: http://www.youtube.com/quinnwentz\n\nLyrics:\nDon't talk, you speak too much.\nJust take the cash and get out.\nDon't worry, you think to much.\nJust do what you need and leave\n\nI don't trust no one and I won't start now.\n(It's a bloodsport.)\nI plan on not dying and I don't care how.\n(You always want more.)\n\nThe money makes up for a good time, good time.\nAnd I'll do what I need to survive, survive.\nIt's not like I'm dead inside.\nBut you gotta kill your morals if you wanna survive\nThe guilts not heavy if the cash flows steady,\nCause I'd sell my own soul if the money's good.\n\nDon't try to rationalize.\nYou'll never make sense of it.\nCause it's kill or wait to be killed.\nYou're the only one who benefits.\n\nI don't trust no one and I won't start now.\n(It's a bloodsport)\nIt's dog eat dog, so you do what you need,\ncause you gotta eat somehow.\n\nhttp://facebook.com/TeenWolfInstinct\nhttp://twitter.com/InstinctTW\nhttp://InstinctTW.tumblr.com", "title": "Former Vandal - If The Money's Good | Teen Wolf Music Made by a Fan [HD]", "publishedDate": "2014-07-26T20:35:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-A_m_50p-Ss", "description": "Maned Wolf howling at dawn in the National Zoological Park in Washington, D,C", "title": "Maned Wolf At Dawn", "publishedDate": "2010-11-09T18:24:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "-A_nfW3ufB0", "description": "", "title": "\"Biochemistry\", Protease Inhibitors in the Treatment of AIDS", "publishedDate": "2012-02-17T01:55:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-A_o5CwPKx4", "description": "SNUGGLE BEAR FIGHTS BACK EVIL", "title": "SNUGGLE BEAR COMMERCIAL GONE WRONG REAL FUNNY", "publishedDate": "2009-02-22T21:30:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-A_zowcZ3Fs", "description": "Stay up to date on all things Screen Invasion: \nhttp://facebook.com/ScreenInvasion\nhttp://twitter.com/ScreenInvasion\nhttp://screeninvasion.com", "title": "FIRST POSITION Clip 4 (2012)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-20T17:40:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Aa-D6KEmbY", "description": "http://www.marielmartinez.com/ \nhttp://www.xn--laporteatango-okb.com/ \nhttp://www.facebook.com/laportenatangotrio http://www.facebook.com/marielmartineztango \nSixteenth Notes, pag 31\nPag. 31\nModern method for guitar berklee 1\nWilliam leavitt\nAlejandro Picciano", "title": "Berklee 1, Sixteenth Notes, pag 31", "publishedDate": "2011-01-13T12:19:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "-Aa9d56W28c", "description": "The Arctic Light hotel will be a brand new contemporary boutique hotel situated in the heart of Lapland-Rovaniemi .

This damage to the valves or muscular tissue of the heart is caused by rheumatic fever. This usually occurs in early life, usually between 6-12 years of age.\n\nEarly manifestations of this rheumatic heart disease which may occur singly or in combination are in the joints and muscles, twitching of muscles, frequent nose bleeding, pallor, poor appetite, and failure to gain weight. Evidence of these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that the child has rheumatic kind of fever. A period of medical observation and special tests may be necessary to determine the presence of rheumatic fever.\n\nThe rheumatic fever does not always cause heart disease, but the heart is the only organ which may be seriously affected by the disease. Repeated attacks of the disease are more likely to cause heart failure.\n\nRecurring attacks usually cease by the age of 15 or 16 years. It is the usual medical recommendation that those suffering from fever stay in bed for weeks or even months after the inflammation has died down. This is to avoid unnecessary heart work.\n\nRheumatic heart diseases cause more deaths than any other disease as rheumatic fever attacks mainly children of school age.\n\nAdequate nutrition, a full play life, sufficient rest, and lots of time out - of doors are other important factors related to the control of the rheumatic heart disease.\n\nCardiologists and pediatricians believe that a great deal can be done in the prevention and control of the disease through special care in the avoidance of colds, and some throats and communicable infections.\nhttp://EzineArticles.com/2971035\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/WikiHeart\nhttp://youtu.be/-AbnAle5qTI", "title": "Rheumatic Heart Disease", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T09:00:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AcGDinwAcU", "description": "HERE IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN UP TO SINCE THE LAST VIDEO.THE RESEARCH TO MAKE THESE ITEMS WAS DONE AND THE SPECIALTY ITEMS WERE PURCHASED ,INCLUDING THE BRUSH WOLF TAIL FUR ,THE RED DYED ALLIGATOR SKIN,HORSE HAIR TAIL HAIR,BEADS,AND BEAD WORK, AND STEATITE STONE AND LOTS OF ELK ANTLER PARTS!!

He's here, to talk about his memoir Hitch 22, and discussions range widely, from his childhood and the suicide of his mother to his boys' lunches with Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie and the gang.

Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. May his 62 years of living, well, so livingly console the many of us who will miss him dearly\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"", "title": "Hitchens '10: The \"Stuff\" for Fiction", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T03:47:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-AfExprxNIk", "description": "i overbent that one note oops. this solo is blistering fast hit it on my third take.

It is a gazetted holiday in India, which is marked on the 10th day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of the month of Ashvin (Ashwayuja), according to the Hindu calendar. Many people of the Hindu faith observe Dussehra through special prayer meetings and food offerings to the gods at home or in temples throughout India. They also hold outdoor fairs (melas) and large parades with effigies of Ravana; a mythical king of ancient Sri Lanka. The effigies are burnt on bonfires in the evening. Dussehra is the culmination of the Navaratri festival. \n\nDussehra celebrates the Hindu god Rama's victory over the demon king Ravana and the triumph of good over evil. The epic Ramayana tells the mythical story of the Lord Rama who wins the lovely Sita for his wife, only to have her carried off by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. Ravana plays an important role in the Ramayana. Ravana had a sister known as Shoorpanakha. She fell in love with the brothers Rama and Lakshamana and wanted to marry one of them. Lakshamana refused to marry her and Rama could not as he was already married to Sita. Shoorpanakha threatened to kill Sita, so that she could marry Rama. This angered Lakshamana who cut off Shoorpanakha's nose and ears. Ravana then kidnapped Sita to avenge his sister's injuries. Rama and Lakshamana later fought a battle to rescue Sita. The monkey god Hanuman and a huge army of monkeys helped them.\n\nSource : http://www.timeanddate.com\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

The shapes are small and irregular so be extra careful not to poke yourself.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this kit is that it doesn't give you enough wool for the outer white layer. Half the stress came from trying to ration the wool so the alpaca could look somewhat symmetrically fluffy. I had to be very careful not to felt too tightly or the wool will get compressed and lose more volume. This is why I'm slightly disappointed with Sunfelt, as Hamanaka kits are hugely generous with the materials. \n\nDifficulty: ADVANCED\n\nBuy this kit: https://www.etsy.com/listing/187093967/japanese-needle-wool-felt-mascot-diy-kit\nFelting Supplies http://tinyurl.com/p7g4qwu\nNail Polish: Models Own HyperGel Lilac\n\n\u2665 Etsy Shop \u2665   http://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Maqaroon\n\u2665 Facebook \u2665   http://www.facebook.com/maqaroon\n\u2665 Twitter \u2665   http://twitter.com/Maqaroon\n\u2665 Instagram \u2665   http://instagram.com/maqaroon\n\u2665 Tumblr \u2665   http://maqaroon.tumblr.com/\n\nCamera: JVC Everio\nSoftware: iMovie 10.0.1\nSound: ASMR / Opening Music - \"Sock Hop\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nI decided not to use music in felting videos because of the ASMR effect (autonomous sensory meridian response).

It failed to win the hearts of rice farmers as they rejected it. After some times it starts spreading throughout India as unwanted plant i.e. weed. Research works were coduncted to manage this weed by different methods including through chemicals but natives adopted innovative concept i.e. Management through utilization. Living with Beshram since decades now natives are aware of its lots of uses. They manage agricultural pest, they use it as medicine and also as live fence. The new uses are managing its natural population efficiently. Pankaj Oudhia has documented the new uses of Ipomoea carnea through his reports.

However, several freestylers want to learn this skill as it does not only look nice; in fact, it is extremely difficult to pull off as well. Moreover, there are several players who are currently playing soccer, and they always use this trick to get past one player. However, the chances of this trick not being perfectly executed are very high. Therefore, many players don't even try this trick. The soccer players who are famous for pulling this trick off on the pitch include the likes of Robinho, Ronaldinho and even Denilson. These three Brazilians were famous for doing this trick on the pitch. There are two ways to do this trick and you can follow the following steps in order to pull this skill off.\n\n1.\nSide Foot The first and the easiest way to pull off a rainbow is with the help of your side foot. The rainbow is basically going to help you push the ball over your back and then over the player who is facing you. This way you will be able to get past the player, and the ball will follow you from the top. In order to pull this trick off with the help of your side foot, roll the ball (just like it will be rolling while you are running on the pitch). Right when the player is in front of you, put one foot sideways, as if it is going to block the ball. Once the side foot is right in the ball's way, use the toe of the other foot to grab the ball between your side foot and your toe. Now take a little jump and see how the ball is going to jump over your back and then it will get past the player who is standing in front of you.\n\n2.\nBack Heel For the back heel rainbow you will require a lot of practice. You will be doing everything in the similar way, just like you did in the previous step. Roll the ball and start running with it. Right when the player is in front of you, this time block the ball's path with the help of your heel. Right when the heel touches the ball, use the toe of the other foot to grab the ball and then push it upwards. The result is going to be the same. However, notice how the side foot rainbow was relatively easier to pull off.\n\n\nMusic: \n\n1.

It has characteristic loud alarm calls which are variously rendered as did he do it or pity to do it leading to colloquial names like the did-he-do-it bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water but may form large flocks in the non-breeding season (winter).\nRed-wattled Lapwings are large waders, about 35 cm long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple sheen, but head and chest and front part of neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.\nRace aigneri is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race lankae is smaller and dark while atronuchalis the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.\nMales and females are similar in plumage but males have a 5% longer wing and tend to have a longer carpal spur. The length of the birds is 320-350mm, wing of 208-247mm with the nominate averaging 223mm, Sri Lanka 217mm. The Bill is 31-36mm and tarsus of 70-83mm. Tail length is 104-128mm.\nIt usually keeps in pairs or trios in well-watered open country, ploughed fields, grazing land, and margins and dry beds of tanks and puddles. They occasionally form large flocks, ranging from 26 to 200 birds.[7] It is also found in forest clearings around rain-filled depressions. It runs about in short spurts and dips forward obliquely (with unflexed legs) to pick up food in a typical plover manner.[8] They are said to feed at night being especially active around the full moon. Is uncannily and ceaselessly vigilant, day or night, and is the first to detect intrusions and raise an alarm, and was therefore considered a nuisance by hunters. Flight rather slow, with deliberate flaps, but capable of remarkable agility when defending nest or being hunted by a hawk.\nIt breeds from West Asia (Iraq, SW Iran, the Arabian/Persian Gulf) eastwards across South Asia (Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the entire Indian subcontinent up to Kanyakumari and up to 1800m in Kashmir/Nepal), with another sub-species further east in Southeast Asia. May migrate altitudinally in spring and autumn (e.g. in N. Baluchistan or NW Pakistan), and spreads out widely in the monsoons on creation of requisite habitats, but by and large the populations are resident.\nThis species is declining in its western range, but is abundant in much of South Asia, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range.\nThe breeding season is mainly March to August. The courtship involves the male puffing its feathers and pointing its beak upwards. The male then shuffles around the female. Several males may display to females and they may be close together. The eggs are laid in a ground scrape or depression sometimes fringed with pebbles, goat or hare droppings. About 3--4 black-blotched buff eggs shaped a bit like a peg-top (pyriform), 42x30 mm on average. Nests are difficult to find since the eggs are cryptically coloured and usually matches the ground pattern. In residential areas, they sometimes take to nesting on roof-tops. They have been recorded nesting on the stones between the rails of a railway track, the adult leaving the nest when trains passed. Nests that have been threatened by agricultural operations have been manually translocated by gradually shifting the eggs. When nesting they will attempt to dive bomb or distract potential predators. Both the male and female incubate the eggs and divert predators using distraction displays or flash their wings to deter any herbivores that threaten the nest. Males appear to relieve the females incubating at the nest particularly towards the hot part of noon. The eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days. The reproductive success is about 40%. Egg mortality is high (~43%) due to predation by mongooses, crows and kites. Chicks had a lower mortality (8.3%) and their survival improved after the first week.\nThe diet of the lapwing includes a range of insects, snails and other invertebrates, mostly picked from the ground. They may also feed on some grains. They feed mainly during the day but they may also feed at night. They may sometimes make use of the legs to disturb insect prey.\nIn parts of India, a local belief is that the bird sleeps on its back with the legs upwards and an associated Hindi metaphor Tithiri se asman thama jayega (\"can the pee-wit support the heavens?\") is used when referring to persons undertaking tasks beyond their ability or strength.", "title": "Lapwing Bird Hunting With Pellet Air Rifle", "publishedDate": "2014-05-18T14:42:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-B9W6CJfLpg", "description": "", "title": "Bass Pond Stocking", "publishedDate": "2012-05-09T22:40:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "-B9_34HTlRA", "description": "", "title": "FNV: Medical System Bedroll", "publishedDate": "2013-05-12T05:01:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-B9eNRGgPuo", "description": "", "title": "nino de la tierra", "publishedDate": "2011-11-26T03:24:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BA3puBxjmM", "description": "http://www.carnivalrest.com\n4356 Woodman Ave, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423 (818) 784-3469 \nhttp://bb-directory.com/\nhummus  kabobs  shawarma  FOUL  lebneh  babaganoush\nThe chef also serves Lebanese specialties such as makanek sausage sauteed with lemon juic", "title": "Sherman Oaks Middle Eastern Restaurants", "publishedDate": "2010-06-20T19:05:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BAAKGM20O8", "description": "How to set up and use the Earthing Outlet Checker", "title": "Earthing Outlet Checker", "publishedDate": "2013-07-27T23:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BAQ8UWdMf0", "description": "Winter Street Artist Chris Silkwood", "title": "Winter Street Artist Chris Silkwood", "publishedDate": "2013-03-12T20:04:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-BAYrt2oER8", "description": "ESL: How to pronounce the IH vowel sound in American English.
