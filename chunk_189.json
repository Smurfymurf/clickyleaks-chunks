It was called \"Drag Battle!\" and featured eight different contestants from Logo TV's smash hit reality show, RuPaul's Drag Race.  The event was held at the Royal Oak Music Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan, which is a close suburb of Detroit.\n\nThe lineup was truly stellar, and included a grand total of nine different drag queens.  Eight of the queens were previous contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race.  From season two, fan favorites Raven and Jujubee were both in attendance.  Manila Luzon and Alexis Mateo represented season three, while Latrice Royale and Willam were here to represent season four.  Season five contestants Roxxxy Andrews and Detox were in attendance as well, and the entire event was hosted by the one and only Vicky Vox.\n\nIn this video clip, Willam, Detox and Vicky Vox perform their hilarious parody of Alicia Key's smash hit single, \"Girl On Fire\".

The Amazon can be a rough world.\nLiving snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica and on most islands. Fifteen families are currently recognized, comprising 456 genera and over 2,900 species.[1][2] They range in size from the tiny, 10 cm-long thread snake to pythons and anacondas of up to 7.6 metres (25 ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 15 metres (49 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago).\n\nMost species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.

Detalla que fue seleccionada de entre 300 m\u00fasicos j\u00f3venes, y de los 12 participantes es la \u00fanica mexicana.\n\nQuien ya se ha presentado en escenarios de Europa, Asia y Estados Unidos relata que el gusto por la m\u00fasica naci\u00f3 desde los dos a\u00f1os de edad cuando escuchaba a su padre tocar el viol\u00edn y a su abuela el piano.\n\n\"A los dos a\u00f1os me compraron un viol\u00edn peque\u00f1o pero nunca me atrajo mucho, y cada vez que escuchaba el piano que tocaba mi abuela me emocionaba mucho y yo quer\u00eda tocarlo\", recuerda.\n\nEntonces lo que en un inicio parec\u00eda un juego se convirti\u00f3 en una pasi\u00f3n, y luego en una profesi\u00f3n que siempre ha guiado su pap\u00e1, Robert Liebman.\n\nA los siete a\u00f1os ingres\u00f3 al Instituto Universitario de Bellas Artes de Colima con el profesor Anatoli Zatin, compositor, m\u00fasico y director de orquesta ruso.\n\nSi bien su trayectoria es corta, los logros son significativos. A los siete a\u00f1os gan\u00f3 su primera competencia en el Concurso Nacional de Piano Parnassos 2009 en Monterrey; un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s recibi\u00f3 el primer lugar en Noche de Madrid, en Espa\u00f1a donde compiti\u00f3 contra solistas de 16 pa\u00edses, y en 2012 gan\u00f3 el primer premio en la categor\u00eda de m\u00fasicos j\u00f3venes en el Russian Music International Piano Competition en San Jos\u00e9, California.\n\nA ello se suma haber sido seleccionada para participar en un concierto de Lang-Lang que ofreci\u00f3 en Berl\u00edn para festejar su cumplea\u00f1os n\u00famero 30, en junio pasado; en la gala participaron 50 ni\u00f1os m\u00fasicos, y el concierto se repiti\u00f3 en la Ciudad\nde  M\u00e9xico.\n\nAdem\u00e1s del talento innato, Liebman dedica cuatro horas diarias a practicar el piano en casa, y la mitad de la semana estudia en Colima con\nAnatoli Zatin.\n\n A ello suma las horas de clases de conocimientos generales que toma v\u00eda Skype con dos maestras de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica. Para la joven pianista el programa home school es la \u00fanica manera de realizar su preparaci\u00f3n como solista.\n\n\"Ya no voy a la escuela normal, llevo un programa con dos maestras particulares, una de ingl\u00e9s y otra en espa\u00f1ol. Es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil por los viajes y las giras que no me permiten ir a la escuela, as\u00ed tomo clases por Skype mucho m\u00e1s padre.\n\n\"Adem\u00e1s mi maestro de piano vive en Colima, entonces pas\u00f3 la mitad de la semana en Guadalajara y la otra mitad en Colima\", dice con alegr\u00eda.\n\nQuien ha sido solista en la Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Aguascalientes y la Filarm\u00f3nica de Jalisco, confiesa que al estar frente al p\u00fablico le gusta compartir las emociones que siente en la m\u00fasica; si es una melod\u00eda triste, se esfuerza en trasmitir esa tristeza, pero si es alegre busca expresar esa energ\u00eda.\n\n\"No s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo se hace, es parte de la din\u00e1mica de las melod\u00edas y depende del tipo de piezas, pero trato de comunicar a la audiencia lo que yo siento\", comenta quien prefiere el jazz y no la m\u00fasica pop, gusta de la lectura y el ajedrez mas no la televisi\u00f3n. \"Ya que empiezas a conocer te das cuenta que la m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica es muy bonita\", concluye.", "title": "PIANISTA MEXICANA CAUTIVA A NUEVA YORK DANIELA LIEBMAN DEBUTA EN EL CARNEGIE HALL", "publishedDate": "2013-10-29T05:49:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "Avdyb-qfTZk", "description": "November 2012\n\nEmma plays Meditation by Arnold Trowell", "title": "Emma Naegele", "publishedDate": "2013-03-15T20:49:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "AveckeT58Hk", "description": "ONE POT CHEF COOKBOOKS ON iTUNES BOOKSTORE:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/david-chilcott/id478668534?mt=11\n\nFruit Mince Shortbread Slice is a delicious combination of traditional Christmas Shortbread and Fruit Mince Pies.

A clean, sharp electrode tip will help maintain consistent welds and ensure easy weld actuation when dealing with small wires.  We used a flat copper alligator grounding clip and a pair of tweezers to hold the two wire ends during the weld.  It is best to clip the ground close to the end being welded (for stability and conductive reasons).  It is easiest to hold the wires at an angle to each other rather than parallel because the wires tend to ball up and draw away from the heat source.  When held at an angle the molten metal can more easily form around both wires. The Argon shielding gas is set at 10psi for good coverage and flow.\n\nBoth sizes of wires are butt welded in Nano Mode with a setting of 1.0ws energy, 2.5ms Length, and with the Standard Plus ignition sequence selected.  The energy setting could be increased or decreased slightly to modify the size of the ball.  Too low of a setting, however, can lead to difficult actuations and weak welds. A single weld actuation is sufficient to join the two wires with good strength.  Consistent ball size and shape can be achieved in a production setting by fixturing the wires for repeatable positioning and alignment with regard to the electrode.\n\nSummary:\nNano Mode is great for welding small components that require finesse. The touchscreen user interface allows operators to quickly dial in settings and the welds can be made quickly and easily. Although we were able to achieve good results using the settings outlined, it is recommended you experiment further with your product to fine tune the settings for even better results.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.\nPhone: +1-801-658-0015\nToll Free Phone: 1-877-786-9353\nEmail: sales@SunstoneEngineering.com\nWebsite: www.

You'll get it all from a guy who's been doing it for nearly 15 years as a bartender and bar manager and is still working behind the bar TO THIS DAY. \n\nConsidering bartending school? Save the $500, it's definitely not necessary. Plus everything you'd get at a school is ALL here on this channel (bartendingpro also worked at a bartending school for a while so...).

It is more exacting and more hazardous\nbecause the operations involved in offshore anchor handling are very complex and weather dependent. Only highly trained seafarers can work on these vessels,\nwhether officers or deckhands. At all times and in every case the importance of safety is\nemphasised. Every operation is preceded by risk assessment conducted by the Master and a toolbox talk between everyone involved in the operation. Nothing is left to chance. No operation is carried out if the weather is unsuitable for it and any that has been started will be halted if the weather becomes detrimental. Safety always comes first. In deep sea operations the tasks become even more complex because more than one\nAHV may be involved due to the heavier chains and other equipment deployed.\nCommunication between the rig and the vessels is vitally important. All functions must be co-ordinated as the operation progresses.

I'm going to first demonstrate. I'm going to stay in a fighting stance like this. I'm going to spin back and do a hook kick. Like that. Make sure you bring it back 360. One more time. Like that. \n\nSo step by step, I do this thing called a back turn. One. Fold your legs just like a back kick. Now make sure when you kick out this time you don't kick straight out. I like to kind of kick out in an angle, one, and throw a right hook and bring it back. So one more time, slowly. One, two, three. One more time. One, fold your legs in. It's important to tuck in. Kick out and hook. And bring it back. \n\nNow I'm going to practice with my partner. He's going to be holding the target. Again, I like to practice maybe in a face level. If you guys are beginners, maybe you can start out a little lower. That's fine. So from here, I like to do a fake shot. So I'm going to be in fighting stance. I'm going to first demonstrate.

They prefer warm temperatures around 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) and do not tolerate cold temperatures. In residential areas, these cockroaches live in basements and sewers, and may move outdoors into yards during warm weather. These cockroaches are common in basements, crawl spaces, cracks and crevices of porches, foundations, and walkways adjacent to buildings.\nThe American cockroach is a scavenger that feeds on decaying organic matter and a variety of other foods. It is particularly fond of fermenting foods.\nFemales produce egg cases and carry them protruding from the tip of the abdomen for about two days. Egg cases are then generally placed on a surface in a hidden location. Egg cases are about 0.9 centimetres (0.35 in) long, brown, and purse shaped. Immature cockroaches emerge from egg cases in 6 to 8 weeks and require 6 to 12 months to mature. Adult cockroaches can live up to one year, during which females produce an average of 150 young.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Life Cycle Of a Cockroach", "publishedDate": "2010-05-04T09:11:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "AvxPMKVwnlU", "description": "my sister and my cousin both bet me $25 to drink two shots of butter and also eat 2 butter pads..the following video is me taking the last shot. we didn't record the part where my heart stopped.", "title": "butter shot", "publishedDate": "2007-08-21T04:40:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AvxafmY2YUY", "description": "Dr. Mary Ann Lila, director of N.C.

For example, it would be racial discrimination if an employer rejected a job application by a white woman applies because they thought she was black for having an African sounding name. \n\nThe equality act   makes it illegal for employers to discriminate you because of your colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the discrimination was on purpose or not, what matters is the way you are treated and if  you are treated less favourably  than someone else because of your race.  This act protects all racial groups. \n\nThere are several different kinds of racial discrimination; direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and victimisation. \n\n Direct discrimination is where someone's race is the main reason for less favourable treatment for example advertising a job for specific racial people. \n\nIndirect discrimination is when rules and policies put racial groups at a disadvantage such as introducing a discriminative dress code. \n\n Harassment is when people allow or encourage unwanted and offence behaviour, such as making racist jokes at work.. \n\nVictimisation is when someone is treated less favourably because they have complained about discrimination. \n\nFor more information and to see if you have been racial discriminated against at work, contact Your Employment Matters today.", "title": "What is Race Discrimination?", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T15:20:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw3K_UyncAE", "description": "Some days you shouldn't leave the roost. www.media-generation.com", "title": "Rhesus Pigeon", "publishedDate": "2006-10-10T01:28:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw3L3bJhUJY", "description": "", "title": "Smashing Coconuts In Space", "publishedDate": "2014-09-30T12:50:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw3STw4-PXw", "description": "Juvenile Mallards diving to feed rather than using the more common \"dabbling\" technique these birds are known for.", "title": "Mallard - Diving not Dabbling", "publishedDate": "2014-06-15T19:54:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw3XWT4jNjk", "description": "Player: xXiNEEDteaXx\nMusic: Whiiite & Schoolboy - Houdini (Calvertron Remix)", "title": "Toxotes Gaming - xXiNEEDteaXx 4 Glock KILLS", "publishedDate": "2012-12-29T13:05:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw3_uHnZqaE", "description": "The Kat Trio (Ekaterinburg Classical Trio):\nVictoria Gorbich - violin; Vladislav Gorbich - clarinet; Justin Snyder - piano.\nDecember 8, 2013.

This all stems from a run-in between Wood and the vice principal at his daughter's school.\n\nHe says he challenged a history class assignment that had students list the benefits of Islam.\n\nThe school says Wood crossed the line and threatened the vice principal.\n\nBoth sides are talking, but they have very different versions of this assignment and the fallout that followed.\n\n\"A lot of people do not understand where my husband is coming from,\u201d said Melissa Wood.\n\nMelissa says her husband Kevin, a United States Marine and Iraq veteran, is the most patriotic person she has met. But now, he is banned from even stepping foot near their daughter's high school.\n\n\"I don't force my religious views on them, so don't force your religious views on me,\" Kevin told us.\n\nThis started when their eleventh grader came home from La Plata High School with a three-page assignment. It asked for explanations of Islam's Five Pillars, Mecca and Muhammad.\n\nKevin and Melissa didn't like it and feel religion should not be taught in public schools. They say Islam should not get priority over Judaism or Christianity.\n\n\"We cannot discuss our Ten Commandments in school, but they can discuss Islam's Five Pillars?\" said Melissa.\n\nKevin went to the school to talk with a vice principal, but things got heated. Kevin would end up getting slapped with a notice banning him from the school property.\n\n\"I have witnesses that have said I did not threaten anybody in any way shape or form,\u201d said Kevin.\n\n\"He was threatening to cause a disruption or possible disruption at the school,\u201d said Katie O'Malley-Simpson, spokesperson for Charles County Public Schools.\n\nShe says the high school was in its rights to ban Kevin from school property. They also that defended the assignment on Islam and say his objections are off base.\n\n\"We're not teaching religion,\u201d said O'Malley-Simpson. \u201cWe're teaching world history.\u201d\n\n\"None of us parents knew about this and they didn't tell anybody,\u201d Kevin said.\n\nFor now, both the Woods and school officials have been talking about the dispute and hope to come to a resolution. But for Melissa, the hardest lesson of all has been hearing her husband described as something she says she knows he is not.\n\n\"They're making him sound like he's some bad person,\u201d she said. \u201cHe's not a bad person. He fought for your country.\u201d\n\nThe Woods' daughter has been allowed to go to the high school library during the class where the assignment was handed out.\n\nRELATED - Home Depot in Dearborn, MI forces employees to learn how to treat Muslims as a protected class.\nWhite Teacher Wants to 'Kill All Black People,' Keeps Job\nKids At CA School Taught Islam And There Is No God But Allah", "title": "[VIDEO] Marine Banned From Daughter's School After Dispute Over Islam Homework Assignment", "publishedDate": "2014-10-30T08:32:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw9VKDFi6sw", "description": "Age 28, anorexic weighing in on 26 kilos (55 pounds)", "title": "Anorexic woman", "publishedDate": "2008-10-04T10:35:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "Aw9p1ZLufgc", "description": "An ITV report on the Caliph and Worldwide head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community (AMC), His Holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad. \n\nBroadcast journalist, Rags Martel, interviews His Holiness about extremism after the weekly Friday prayers at Baitul Futuh, the largest Mosque in Western Europe.

When the Revolution began, the Americans adopted the song as a rallying tune, and it was played by fifers and drummers in every camp and battle.

Los saltamontes pueden saltar grandes distancias con sus potentes patas traseras, y en algunas ocasiones tambi\u00e9n son capaces de migrar. Esta circunstancia se da cuando se concentran demasiados individuos en una misma zona. Ante la escasez de alimento, su organismo libera una serie de hormonas que fomentan la movilidad alar para que los individuos puedan desplazarse volando a otros lugares y evitar as\u00ed la competencia intraespec\u00edfica por el alimento. Algunas especies, como Locusta migratoria y Schistocerca gregaria, se desplazan en grandes enjambres diezmando las cosechas.\n\nAlgunas especies producen ruidos audibles, usualmente frotando los f\u00e9mures contra las alas o el abdomen o con el golpeteo de las alas en el vuelo. Si cuentan con \u00f3rgano de audici\u00f3n, este se encuentra los costados del primer segmento abdominal. Las patas traseras son t\u00edpicamente largas y fuertes, apropiadas para saltar. Generalmente cuentan con alas pero solo las traseras son membranosas y les permiten volar, mientras que las delanteras son cori\u00e1ceas y no son \u00fatiles en el vuelo. Las hembras son de mayor tama\u00f1o que los machos.\n\nLos ort\u00f3pteros cuyas antenas son tan largas o m\u00e1s que su propio cuerpo son en realidad grillos de matorral o saltamontes de antenas largas y pertenecen al suborden Ensifera, de los que se diferencian tambi\u00e9n por la estructura del ovipositor, as\u00ed como la localizaci\u00f3n del \u00f3rgano auditivo y la forma en que producen los sonidos caracter\u00edsticos. En t\u00e9rminos evolutivos existe una divisi\u00f3n entre ambos sub\u00f3rdenes que data del l\u00edmite Permo-Tri\u00e1sico.[1]\n\nLos huevos se colocan generalmente en una sustancia espumosa que los protege durante la incubaci\u00f3n.

If you've noticed I am now using Copic Markers and loving it. this isnt the first time ive used them.. i have tried them the day i got them :]\n\nBLOG: http://lovetheart-fashion.blogspot.com\nDEVIANTART: http://zyrabanez.deviantart.com\nINSTAGRAM: @zyrarrr\n\nFAQ [Frequently Asked Questions]\n\n1. What materials do you use for your drawings?\nI use Copic Ciao markers and Touch Twin Markers, Quill Multiboard white paper, 2B and HB Pentel and Faber-Castell 0.5 mechanical pencils and Faber-Castell PVC-Free Space Eraser (Cool name) and I use Uni-ball Signo white fineliner\n\n2. Did you go to any art school or academy?\nNo. I am taking Studio Arts in senior high school right now. It's not from that class that I learned what I know. I am learning new things from the class, but so far, not to do with fashion illustration or manga drawings. I go to a regular high school, so it doesn't specialize in art.\n\n3. How do you draw the models? Do you use any templates?\nI started out by tracing models from magazines which is harder than it sounds, but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy. Then of course, I searched all types of videos on YouTube and some sites as well on Google, which unfortunately, I don't remember.\n\n4. How old are you?\nI am 16 years old. \n\n5. How long have you been drawing?\nI'm pretty sure I started drawing at 6. That's probably my oldest memory of me drawing. I got into manga drawings when I was 11 years old, I started teaching myself how to draw manga when I was 13 years old. I started developing an interest in fashion design also when I was 11, but I pursued that interest or taken it further at the age of 14. So, I would say I started drawing fashion illustration at the age of 14.\n\n6. Where do you get your inspiration?\nI get my inspiration from music, photos on Instagram, fashion trends, things that I love. There are times where I am just in an Artist's Block and I feel really brain dead where I can't draw. Or I force myself to draw and it never turns out to be something I like. I am currently in an Artist's Block which has been going on since late October 2011, and I am finding ways to get out of it. I'll keep you posted on how I break through it :]\n\n7. Do you have any links or books you can recommend?\nDefinitely! Fashion Illustration by Anna Kiper and Fashion Poses for Fashion Illustrators by Sha Tahmasebi are two books that I own at the moment. I'm hoping to get more. These two books are very helpful if you're a beginner or even if you want to be a bit more advanced. \nhttp://www.monkeysee.com/play/5156-how-to-draw-clothes-on-a-fashion-figure\nthis is a very basic tutorial but seriously, this tutorial helped me when I was just starting.

Service is best known for his poems \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", from his first book, Songs of a Sourdough (1907; also published as The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses). \"These humorous tales in verse were considered doggerel by the literary set, yet remain extremely popular to this day.\" Robert W. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the first of ten children. His father, also Robert Service, was a banker from Kilwinning, Scotland, who had been transferred to England. At five years old Robert W. Service went to live in Kilwinning with his three maiden aunts and his paternal grandfather, who was the town's postmaster. There he is said to have composed his first verse, a grace, on his sixth birthday: \"God bless the cakes and bless the jam; Bless the cheese and the cold boiled ham; Bless the scones Aunt Jeannie makes, And save us all from bellyaches. Amen\"\n\nIn 1913, Service arrived in Paris, where he would live for the next 15 years. He settled in the Latin Quarter, posing as a painter. In June 1913, he married Parisienne Germaine Bourgoin, daughter of a distillery owner, and they purchased a summer home at Lancieux, C\u00f4tes-d'Armor, in the Brittany region of France. Thirteen years younger than her husband, Germaine Service lived 31 years following his death, dying at age 102 in 1989. Robert Service was 41 when World War I broke out; he enlisted, but was turned down \"due to varicose veins.\" He briefly covered the war for the Toronto Star (from December 11, 1915 through January 29, 1916), but \"was arrested and nearly executed in an outbreak of spy hysteria in Dunkirk.\" -- then \"worked as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver with the Ambulance Corps of the American Red Cross, until his health broke.\" Convalescing in Paris, he wrote a new book of mainly war poetry, Rhymes of a Red Cross Man, in 1916. The book was dedicated to the memory of Service's \"brother, Lieutenant Albert Service, Canadian Infantry, Killed in Action, France, August 1916.\"\n\nWith the end of the war, Service  settled down to being a rich man in Paris.... During the day he would promenade in the best suits, with a monocle. At night he went out in old clothes with the company of his doorman, a retired policeman, to visit the lowest dives of the city.. During his time in Paris he was reputedly the wealthiest author living in the city, yet was known to dress as a working man and walk the streets, blending in and observing everything around him. Those experiences would be used in his next book of poetry, Ballads of a Bohemian (1921), The poems are given in the persona of an American poet in Paris who serves as an ambulance driver and an infantryman in the war. The verses are separated by diary entries over a period of four years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "title": "Robert W  Service - Music In The Bush", "publishedDate": "2013-11-24T19:23:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AwXiEfSr5Fw", "description": "Support Our Dawah: http://www.mercifulservant.com\nLike - Share - Subscribe (Official Links Below)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOfficial Website: http://www.mercifulservant.com\nOfficial YouTube Channel: http://full.sc/WWEURu\nSecond Channel: http://full.sc/PKjGAU\nOfficial Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mercifulservant\nInstagram: http://followgram.me/MercifulServant\nSoundCloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/mercifulservant\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nAny of the views expressed by the speakers do not necessarily represent the views of The Merciful Servant or any other projects it may have or intend to do.

In this episode of A State of Sight, Isaac Porter, MD explains the causes of pinguecula, describes the problem in detail, and discusses possible treatment options.\n\nUsually, we believe that a pinguecula forms when the eye is exposed to UV radiation from sunlight. They may be seen more frequently in people who work outdoors and in those who live in areas closer to the equator. This exposure causes changes in the conjunctiva similar to a growth that thickens the conjunctiva over the white part of the eye between the eyelids. This growth is not a form of cancer, and it is much more common than the types of cancer that can occur in the same location on the eye, including squamous cell and melanoma.\n\nIf a pinguecula becomes large or inflamed, it can cause irritation that may be manged with artificial tears or prescription drops. Most often, they do not cause any problems and do not require treatment.\n\nDo you have any questions about pinguecula or has this ever affected your eye?

The major part of the vineyards (4.65 hectares) stands in the district of San Paolo within the commune of Tufo, which is considered the best zone for the Greco grape variety. The Aglianico vineyards (3.3 hectares) stand in the zone of Montemiletto. The altitude is ideal between 450 and 600 meters above sea level with southern exposure, the area is cool and airy, which naturally protects the vines against frosts and diseases. The Greco vineyards stand next to abandoned sulphur mines and sulphur rocks can be found amongst the vines: this gives the wines wonderful mineral notes. The cellar equipment is extremely modern. The talented oenologist Paolo Caciorna helps the Ferrara family make great wines that are appreciated worldwide.", "title": "Ferrara by Marc de Grazia Selections", "publishedDate": "2012-03-23T12:32:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "AwsLVn18lwo", "description": "Least Count in Indian Sign Language (category = Measurement).

I didn't know the exact size or location, but finally found it in the Chapel of St. Venantius, which was added to the Baptistry in 640-42. \n\nIt looks like a typical ancient Roman Chapel, and was partially remodeled relatively recently. I don't yet know the exact date, but I have reason to believe it was remodeled within the last 50 years. A poured concrete floor was added, suspended over the ancient floor, and a new altar and altar piece were added.\n\nHowever, there is something different. The \"new\" altar piece is unusually tall, hiding the apse mosaic, an original mosaic from the 7th century. I couldn't recall seeing another church in Rome where the apse mosaic is hidden in this manner. I asked myself \"what's the deal - since when do you hide a 7th century mosaic?\" The reason becomes obvious when you walk up to the side and peek behind the altar piece.\n\nApparently the Church hides such an apse mosaic when it shows the Virgin Mary wearing the pallium, the ancient priestly vestment that only archbishops and popes have worn for the last 1,600 years or so. The mosaic shows Mary wearing a white pallium over a dark chasuble, portrayed as a priest, with her hands raised in intercessory prayer. \nI can only assume that when this chapel was remodeled the architects, while they could not bring themselves to change the apse mosaic, must have decided to cover it up. I'm sure they felt it was scandalous to show a woman wearing a garment that is reserved for archbishops and popes. The new altar piece features a much more \"traditional\" image of Mary with the baby Jesus.", "title": "Mary Wearing Pallium - St. John Lateran Baptistry", "publishedDate": "2008-05-25T07:58:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "Awu_mRdwHk4", "description": "Album \"Rue de la Conche\" 2006.

Engineers create vehicles that are strong enough to fly Effectively and efficiently by using specific materials and structures that are lightweight and durable. Important decisions are made regarding the materials that are used to make the fuselage, wings, tail, and engine. Many airplane materials are now made of composite materials that are lightweight, yet stronger than most metals. This issue shows how aircraft manufacturers are utilizing materials such as carbon fiber along with aluminum and titanium to engineer aircraft. The boom in aeronautics and commercial aviation came when thousands of pilots were released from military service after World War II and the potential for using aircraft as an affordable and convenient method of transportation led to the creation of airline companies eager to capitalize on this emerging and untapped market. The Boeing 707 was introduced in 1958 as the first widely used passenger jet and laid the foundation for Boeing\ufffd\u20ac\u2122s steady rise in the jet airliner market. More recent models, including the the 787 Dreamliner, have improved aerodynamics, advances in engine technology, better fuel consumption, and improved cabin features. Since NASA no longer flies people and cargo to the International Space Station it is turning to private companies. Virgin Galactic's Space Ship One and Space Ship Two along with SpaceX's Dragon show how private companies are moving into commercial spaceflight with new advances in aeronautics.", "title": "Aeronautics - The Science Of Flight K4616", "publishedDate": "2013-12-11T23:50:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AwzVRSYkdmc", "description": "medall\u00f3n de madera reciclada (coigue) convertida en plat\u00f3n vitrificado medidas 62cms por 50 cms y peso aproximado de 4 kilos.", "title": "PLATON MADERA NOBLE (COIGUE)RECICLADA VITRIFICADA", "publishedDate": "2012-04-20T04:35:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "AwzXR2_z6KQ", "description": "The ALL NEW Western HTS - Half-Ton Snowplow offers light duty truck owners a better alternative to small, plastic snowplows.

One of the most versatile and helpful of the true remedies is the hot foot bath. The hot foot bath is a true remedy. It can be used to reduce a fever since it causes the number of circulating white blood cells to be increased and the toxins which cause an elevated body temperature are removed, and the thermostat is restored to normal. The hot foot bath can combat a cold, headache, or any congestion of the head, the chest, or the pelvic organs in menstrual difficulties by pulling excess blood from the congested part, thereby increasing the effective circulation. The hot foot bath can open up the totally blocked nasal passage of a person in about five minutes. There is a measured increase in the flow of blood to the pelvic organs as well as to the structures of the nose, throat, and bronchi when the feet are placed in hot water.\n\nThe hot foot bath is very easily administered. A deep container such as a foot tub, a large washpan, or even a large trash can may be used for the purpose. Fill the tub about three-quarters full with water at about 110 degrees, or about as hot as the person can tolerate it. The ordinary foot bath lasts from twenty to thirty minutes. During that time the temperature should be kept as hot as the person can take it. For some who object to the heat, start the foot bath at about 105 degrees and build the temperature up during the next 2-5 minutes until it reaches 110 to 115 degrees. The feet should become quite red while in the tub. At the end of 30 minutes pour cold water over the feet to close off the pores, to intensify and prolong the action of the hot water.", "title": "Hot Foot Bath For Sore Throat and Head Congestion", "publishedDate": "2012-09-15T21:17:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxHt4-GDvck", "description": "http://www.pianojuggler.com Dan Menendez juggler extraordinaire http://www.youtube.com/user/Bouncecellist?feature=CAQQwRs%3D", "title": "Worlds Fastest Piano Juggler Part - 2 The Son.", "publishedDate": "2011-03-24T01:36:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxHynraEg4E", "description": "http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australian-Museum-Eureka-Prizes/\nHighly commended, 2012 University of Sydney Sleek Geeks Science Eureka Prize - Primary\nSean Chionh, Andrew Lee & Kailey Wheatcroft\nCaladenia Primary School\n\"Have you ever wondered why the Sun's gravity doesn't pull Earth in?

Not because of the near perfect weather, the chance to check in with neighbors, the fun block parties, or the increasingly skimpy adult female  costumes (whoever is responsible for this trend deserves a medal, in my opinion - Kim begs to differ).\nIt's because for the first time in my life, I get to go trick or treating with my kids.\n\nAs a former local news anchor, Halloween always happens at the start of a period called \"November Sweeps.\"  You CAN'T take time off from work, and at my station I was at the anchor desk until about 8:00pm. I'd rush to my neighborhood (well, not \"rush\" - there are like a billion kids stumbling through the street like drunken sailors) and find my kids, and see them knock on two doors before they crash from the impending sugar coma.  Not enough time.\nSo this year I am making up for lost time.  I am picking the kids up from class and we are getting dressed immediately. I am taking enough pictures to fill up a NORAD server.  I am toasting pumpklin seeds.  I am setting up an adult margarita station in my driveway for pregame. \nOh, and I am wearing exactly what my kids want me to wear.  But that's the rule now, anyway, right?\nSure, I love the ironic, irreverant, borderline insensitive costume. This year it'll be the Ebola Hazmat suit, Breaking Bad Guy, or \"Zombie Anyone Famous who Died This Year\".  But those are for adult parties. \nFor the 31st, PARENTS WEAR WHAT THE KIDS WANT.\nWhich means this year, there will be 6,238,549 families dressed in Frozen costumes this coming week.\nDon't believe me? Check out Google's costume predictor for most used outfits this year!\n1. Elsa\n2. Olaf\n5. Anna\nI mean, the movie came out LAST YEAR! \nGranted, this will probably be the last big cash influx of the Frozen Empire, but we are contributing, once again.  There was never any doubt.  In JANUARY, Lola and Penn Charles came into the kitchen and assigned the costumes.  She's Elsa, he's Olaf, Kim's Anna, I am the Moose, or Reindeer, or whatever.  Discussion over.\nBut how fun is it to dress up as a family in the same theme? I love the \"Team Halloween\" concept. Sure, the costumes invariably look ridiculous on the grown-ups, but the kids LOVE it, and the parents can get in on the action as well, instead of skulking at the edge of the lawn, awkwardly waving and waiting for the kids to run back to them.  We are allowed to have fun, too, right?\n\nWe hope you enjoy our Halloween Video.

His works exhibit both of these divergent styles to varying degrees, some making an interesting synthesis. He composed in all genres of the time: mass movements, motets, canons, virelais, madrigals, ballatas, etc. Together with his English contemporary Leonel Power, he represented one of the two stylistic poles which would yield the landmark music of the Franco-Flemish Renaissance, Guillaume Dufay being the most important synthesizer of the two.", "title": "Johannes Ciconia: Che vole amar", "publishedDate": "2009-06-21T22:34:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxTjarkrE9c", "description": "Skupina Frequency v Rannej \u0161ou live. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JaSomFunRadio\nhttps://www.facebook.com/juniorAmarcel\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/frequency.sk", "title": "Frequency - Red\u00b4O\u00b4Metry (live@Funradio)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-13T15:06:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxU29ssklVM", "description": "", "title": "Di'ja Ft  Ice Prince   Yaro Remix", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T15:32:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxU7ikIdodg", "description": "81 years old  old man complaint against daughter and son in law, they snatch off  wealth", "title": "Old man complaint against Daughter and son in law  : Chuttuvattom News", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T15:17:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxUAfI1F1fM", "description": "Music: Lively 1920's songs - 1929", "title": "Linda Vesate 1920's (Modes v\u0113sture).avi", "publishedDate": "2011-11-06T14:13:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "AxUJjSXexaI", "description": "If famous internet animals could talk, I'm pretty sure they'd sound absolutely nothing like this. \n\nIf you find any funny animals you want me to voice then send them to me on facebook, links below! \n\nFollow me on twitter for noodz: https://twitter.com/Chris_Kendall_\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chris-Kendall/194611147237682?ref=hl\ntumblr: http://crabstickz.tumblr.com\n\nBuy the T-shirt I'm wearing!

Then the four element TRM senses and records the weak scattered signal. \nNext, the TR satege begins in which the recorded signals are time-reversed for their subsequent normalization and reradiation into the medium. \nThe result is a signal that focuses in time and space where the target originally was, permitting localization and identification applications.  \n\nAuthor: Ph.

Whole life insurance is permanent life insurance coverage that lasts as long as you live and continue to make on time premium payments. The reason that whole life insurance quotes are so much more expensive is due to the fact that the policy will have to pay out a death benefit when you die.\n\nWhole life insurance quotes are available online from many insurance companies that have an online presence. Online life insurance quotes let you search for the policy that best suits your needs. When you log onto each site, you can read the information regarding the whole life insurance policies available and request free quotes. You should request at least three or more quotes so you can compare the different rates.\n\nWhen you compare the whole life insurance quotes you have got, the cheapest is not always the best one to choose. They can be quite affordable because the payment of premiums stretches out over a longer period of time. When you are comparing the online life insurance quotes you receive, you shouldn't just think about the amount of the monthly premium but the length of time that you have to pay the premiums.\n\nWhen comparing whole life insurance quotes there are quite a few things to think about.\n\nFor a website totally devoted to Life Insurance visit Peter's Website Life Insurance Answers and find out about Life Insurance Answers as well as Term Life Insurance and more, including Online Life Insurance and Life Insurance Agents.\n\nhttp://tiny.cc/LifeInsuranceQuotes\n\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Peter_Crump\n\n\nHelpful Tags:\n\n----------------------------------------------\nSearches related to life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance calculator\n\nmanulife life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance quotes\n\nlife insurance companies\n\nterm life insurance rates\n\nterm life insurance\n\nlife insurance rates by age\n\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates\nterm life insurance rates\nwhole life insurance rates\nbest life insurance rates\ncompare life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates by age\nlife insurance rate\naverage life insurance rates\nbest term life insurance rates\ncheap life insurance rates\npermanent life insurance rates\nlife insurance ratings\nlife insurance rate quote\nlife insurance rate chart\nterm life insurance rate\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rate quotes\nlife insurance company ratings\nbanner life insurance rating\nterm life insurance rates chart\nterm life insurance rates by age\nterm life insurance quotes\nlife insurance rate calculator\nlife insurance quotes\nlife insurance quote\nonline term life insurance rates\nterm life insurance\nlife insurance companies\nwhole life insurance quotes\nbest life insurance companies\nwhole life insurance\nbest life insurance\nbest term life insurance rate\ncheap life insurance\nuniversal life insurance\nlife insurance types\nlife insurance quotes online\nsenior life insurance\nlife insurance\nbest term life insurance\nterm life insurance quote\nlife insurance policies\naverage term life insurance rates\nlife insurance cost\naffordable life insurance\n20 year term life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates term\ninstant life insurance quotes\nonline life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates comparison\ntop rated life insurance companies\n--------------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/lifeinsuranceratable\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TermLifeInsuranceify\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLifeinsurancequot\n\nlife insurance rates,life insurance calculator,manulife life insurance rates,life insurance quotes,life insurance companies,term life insurance rates,term life insurance,life insurance rates by age,mortgage life insurance rates", "title": "Life Insurance Rates!

Orange Tip flits along sunny paths and woodland ridesand  love nectar from Lunaria  and Red Campion flowers. Orange colour warns predators it tastes foul.   \n\nAttractive spring butterfly.  40 mm wingspan. Damp pastures and meadows, damp woodland edges and glades, riverbanks, ditches, dykes, fens, railway cuttings and country lanes. Male\u00b4s orange patch on dark tipped forwing absent in female. Hind underwings of both sexes marbled green and white. Larvae feed manly on Cuckoo flower - .Cardamine pratensis.\n\nThe female lays eggs singly on the flowerheads of Cuckooflower Cardamine pratensis and Garlic Mustard Alliaria petiolata and many other species of wild Crucifers, all of which contain substances called glucosinolates. Females are attracted to larger flowers, such as Hesperis matronalis, even though some such species are poor larval hosts. Selection of foodplants is triggered by the presence of mustard oils and their derivative glucosinolates, which (in Pierinae) are detected by chemosensory hairs on the fore-legs. Reproductive rate of females appears to be limited by difficulties in finding suitable hosts. As a consequence, the species has evolved to use a wide range of crucifers. The eggs are white to begin with but change to a bright orange after a few days before darkening off just before hatching. Because the larvae feed almost exclusively on the flowers and developing seedpods there is rarely enough food to support more than one larva per plant. If two larvae meet one will often be eaten by the other to eliminate its competitor. Newly hatched larvae will also eat unhatched eggs for the same reason. To stop eggs from being laid on plants already laid on the female leaves a pheromone to deter future females from laying. There are five larval instars. The green and white caterpillar is attacked by several natural enemies (notably Tachinid flies and Braconid wasps). Pupation occurs in early summer in scrubby vegetation near the foodplant, where they stay to emerge the following spring. Recent research suggests that the emergence of the butterfly may be delayed for as much as two years, thus insuring the species against unfavourable conditions in a given season. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocharis_cardamines\n\nCardamine  is a food plant for the orange tip butterfly (Anthocharis cardamines) and makes a valuable addition to any garden which aims at attracting wildlife. It was once used as a substitute for watercress. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamine_pratensis \n\nThey were named cuckoo flower because they bloom in spring, while the cuckoo is in this country, from April until June. The name appears to be very old because the 16th century herbalist, John Gerard, explained that its name came from this link with the cuckoo, although another 16th century reason for the name is that the flower's foliage is often covered with cuckoo spit. Cuckoo spit has nothing to do with cuckoos, however; it is the white foam produced to conceal the nymphs of the froghopper.

Confidential) star in Traitor, a taut international thriller set against a jigsaw puzzle of covert counter-espionage operations. Traitor is written and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff (screenwriter of The Day After Tomorrow). When straight arrow FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) heads up the investigation into a dangerous international conspiracy, all clues seem to lead back to former U.S. Special Operations officer, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle). A mysterious figure with a web of connections to terrorist organizations, Horn has a knack for emerging on the scene just as a major operation goes down. The inter-agency task force looking into the case meets with Carter (Jeff Daniels), a veteran CIA contractor who seemingly has his own agenda and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), a fellow FBI agent. The task force links Horn to a prison break in Yemen, a bombing in Nice and a raid in London, but a tangle of contradictory evidence emerges, forcing Clayton to question whether his quarry is a disaffected former military operative\u00e2\u0080\u0094or something far more complicated. Obsessed with discovering the truth, Clayton tracks Horn across the globe as the elusive ex-soldier burrows deeper and deeper into a world of shadows and intrigue.

A passionate suffragist, socialist, fiercely intelligent, Rebecca West began her career as a writer with articles in The Freewoman and The Clarion. Her first book, a biography of Henry James, was published when she was only twenty-four, and her first novel followed just two years later. She had a notorious affair with H.G. Wells, and their illegitimate son, Anthony, was born at the beginning of the First World War. The author of several novels, she is perhaps best remembered for her classic account of pre-war Yugoslavia, Black Lamb, Grey Falcon (published by Macmillan in 1941 and as relevant today as it was sixty years ago) and for her coverage of the Nuremberg Trials. When she died in 1983 at the age of 90, William Shawn, then editor-in-chief of the New Yorker, said: Rebecca West was one of the giants and will have a lasting place in English literature. No one in this century wrote more dazzling prose, or had more wit, or looked at the intricacies of human character and the ways of the world more intelligently. Formidably talented, West was a towering figure in the British literary landscape. Lorna Gibb's vivid and insightful biography affords a dazzling insight into her life and work. \n\n Editorial Reviews  Review  \"\"It's especially impressive that Gibb manages to chronicle West's often complicated life in an even-handed, coherent way. Fast-paced and well-researched, The Extraordinary Life of Rebecca West is a fine biography of a writer whose life and career was full of fascinating contradictions and intersections.\"\"  New York Times Book Review\n\n\"\"West was a woman of 'surprising contradictions,' and this biography captures them all without losing sight of the very real person in whom they resided.\"\"  Washington Post\n\n\"\"Gibb s meticulous biography, [...] concentrates [...] on her magnetic subject s complex personality and all the drama and controversy that make West s life truly  extraordinary.  Booklist\n\nPraise for the UK Edition of West's World:\n\n\"\" it presents with discerning succinctness, a sharply etched portrait of a true original Cissie Fairfield remained alive and well inside her alter ego, to judge from Lorna Gibb's brisk and affectionate biography.\"\" The Sunday Times\n\n\"\"This riveting book is not a typical literary biography Lorna Gibb may have read all of Rebecca West's vast output, but she does not flaunt it Miss Gibb wisely leaves it to others to appraise her subject as a writer. What she does is to tell a gripping story of a woman's life \"\" Country Life\n\n\"\" in this calm, well researched biography she does an excellent job of reminding us why West was so ahead of her time.\"\" The Mail\n\n\"\" Lorna Gibb makes the most of the reams of papers that West and her many friends and acquaintances produced.\"\" Literary Review    About the Author  Lorna Gibb holds a Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. She is currently Visiting Research Fellow in History at Essex University. She lives in London. Her biography of Lady Hester Stanhope, Lady Hester, was published to great acclaim in 2005.\n     \"", "title": "[FREE PDF] The Extraordinary Life of Rebecca West by Lorna Gibb", "publishedDate": "2014-07-12T09:12:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ay9LzDzJH2E", "description": "Truncus arteriosus communis (TAC)", "title": "Truncus arteriosus communis (TAC)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-11T16:03:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "Ay9pTLa3mSE", "description": "Here's what you've been waiting for!

There are several supplements and oils you can use for eczema and dermatitis treatment. Tired of pursuing natural and herbal eczema remedies with no results, visit: http://www.VanishEczema.net\n\nHere are some different types of eczema:\n\nAtopic dermatitis - This occurs due to allergies and is usually found in families with a history of asthma or hay fever. It usually begins in infancy and may vary in severity during childhood and adolescence. It often becomes less bothersome in adulthood unless the person is exposed to allergens or irritants. It is not know the exact cause of this kind of eczema or dermatitis but is most likely due to a malfunction in the body's immune system. Stress is a factor in worsening atopic dermatitis but is not the cause\nContact dermatitis - Caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The irritants can include bath soap, laundry soap, household cleaning products and detergents. The allergens can include weeds, jewelry, perfume, cosmetics, neomycin (an ingredient in antibiotic creams), etc.\nSeborrheic dermatitis - This is a red rash with a yellowish oily scale. It is common in people with oily skin or hair and may come or go depending on the time of year, during times of physical stress or in people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It is known as cradle cap when found on babies.\nStasis dermatitis -This can occur when fluid accumulates in the tissues just beneath your skin and usually is found on the lower leg. Because of the extra fluid it inhibates your blood's ability to nourish the skin and puts pressure on the skin from beneath.\nNeurodermatitis -Usually this type occurs in areas where your clothing rubs or scratches your skin. You then further irritate the skin by rubbing or scratching your skin as well.\nPerioral dermatitis - This type is a form of the skin disorder rosacea, adult acne or seborrheic dermatitis which involves the skin about the nose and mouth. Again, the exact cause is not known, but it is likely that cosmetics, face creams, etc. may be the culprit.\nLearn How to Cure These Eczema Conditons at: http://www.VanishEczema.net", "title": "Treatment For Eczema - Natural Way", "publishedDate": "2014-01-27T12:48:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyRXqllBvpw", "description": "Messor passeggia sull'erba artificiale\nMessor walks on artificial grass", "title": "Messor Capitatus a passeggio sull'erba artificiale", "publishedDate": "2013-06-01T15:47:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyRg9kNwCrk", "description": "arborist training aerial rescue", "title": "Arborist training Aerial Rescue", "publishedDate": "2013-12-28T01:24:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyS0PEomnOc", "description": "this is my .177 (BBcal) 4.5 mm bb gun it also shoots pelets but they dont work as well i will post a video on the accuracya nd strgth of the gun \nthank you", "title": "Marksman Repeater BB gun review", "publishedDate": "2009-02-13T15:49:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "AySAdz0NsFA", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "Mongolian fun house 254777", "publishedDate": "2011-09-16T22:32:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "AySCSqz14FM", "description": "tiflis    tbilisi   georgia   gruzia 2010", "title": "tiflis    tbilisi   georgia   gruzia 2010", "publishedDate": "2010-08-04T16:18:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "AySb8zsi6_g", "description": "I get really bored sometimes lol.", "title": "Pamplemousse And Objectivity.", "publishedDate": "2009-10-08T08:38:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyTH0ubBTos", "description": "http://easyhorsetraining.com/fundamentals-course/introduction-to-horseback-riding/ to get the full training video\n\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/ezhorsetraining to follow us on twitter\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Easy-Horse-Training/114342691911080 to fan us on Facebook\n\nIntroduction to Horseback Riding Lessons This hot new ebook tells you all you need to know to prepare you to ride a horse safely and in style - before you you ever approach a horse.

This includes the skin as well. Skin problems may at times be the very first signs of diabetes. Most skin conditions can be easily treated or even prevented if caught early.\n\nSkin Conditions Related To Diabetes\n\nAcanthosis Nigricans\n\nAcanthosis nigricans is a condition in which the skin appears to have a tan or brown raised areas that appear on the sides of the armpit, neck or groin. Acanthosis nigricans may also occur on the knees, elbows and hands. People who are overweight are more susceptible to this condition. Weight loss may help alleviate the symptoms of this condition. Some creams can also help lighten the spots.\n\nAllergic Reactions\n\nAllergic skin reactions may appear as a result of a response to certain medicines. You must tell the doctor if you feel that you are having a reaction because of a medicine. Watch out for signs of rashes, bumps or depression at the sites where you inject insulin.\n\nDiabetic Dermopathy\n\nDiabetes may cause changes in small blood vessels. This can lead to a skin problem called diabetic dermopathy. Dermopathy appear like light brown, scaly patches on the skin. These patched may be circular or oval. They are sometimes mistaken for age spots. These patches do not hurt or itch.\n\nDiabetic Blisters\n\nEven though it's rare, people with diabetes may erupt in blisters. Diabetic blisters can appear on the backs of fingers, toes, feet, hands and sometimes on forearms or legs. Diabetic blisters look similar to burn blisters and are often observed in people who have diabetic neuropathy. They are mostly painless and don't seem to have signs of redness around them. They heal on their own, usually without leaving behind a scar, in about three weeks. Treatment involves bringing blood sugar levels under control.\n\nGood Skin Care\n\nThere are several things you could do to avoid skin problems:\n\n1. Manage your diabetes well. People with high blood sugar levels mostly have dry skin and have a decreased ability to fight off harmful bacteria.\n\n2. Keep your skin clean and dry. Use talcum powder in areas where the skin rubs frequently such as the groin and armpits.\n\n3. Avoid very hot water baths and showers.\n\n4. Prevent dry skin. Moisturize the skin to avoid chapping, especially during the cold season.\n\n5. Do not ignore cuts. Wash minor cuts with a mild soap and water. See a doctor if you get a major cut, infection or burn.\n\n6. Take good care of your feet. Examine your feet everyday for sores and cuts. Wear comfortable footwear. Do not forget to check your shoes for foreign objects before wearing them.\n\n7. Visit a dermatologist (skin doctor) if your skin problems still persist.\n http://EzineArticles.com/8716649\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/YoutupediaFR\nhttp://youtu.be/AyUbP2nyOfU", "title": "Diabetes and Your Skin", "publishedDate": "2014-10-05T08:36:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyUp1rnv7rY", "description": "Sophie Hunger live covering Noir D\u00e9sir's song \"Le Vent nous portera\".\nShot by Jeremiah\nProduced by Kidam", "title": "Sophie Hunger - Le Vent nous portera", "publishedDate": "2010-03-10T09:55:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyV5BxCtr40", "description": "rM beating the Na#1 team !

Now you can enjoy the beauty of these bright little golfball-like blooms even if you don't want to dry them for Everlastings -- they look so attractive on the bushy, well-branched plant that they're the perfect complement to everything else in the sunny garden, and just as lovely fresh as dried!\nAll Around Purple is a brilliantly colored bloom about an inch wide and shaped something like a very fat strawberry. It arises on stiff stems (just made for cutting!) all summer long, with a fully-blooming plant a sea of eye-catching grape! Grow it alongside Globe Amaranth Strawberry Fields Forever for an eye-popping display of bold color!\n\nUnlike many Globe Amaranths, which are rather weedy and sparse, All Around Purple is a fat, bushy little plant 2 feet tall and 12 to 18 inches wide. Even if you don't cut many of your garden flowers, grow All Around Purple just for the garden display. It's ideal for containers, too, billowing up and out with a symmetrically round, full silhouette!\n\nAnd All Around Purple has a much longer \"vase life\" than most other Globe Amaranths. While the bright color fades from many other varieties after a few months, All Around Pruple becomes, if anything, even more intense over time. What a boon for those hardworking outdoor Everlasting arrangements (such as door wreaths and sun porch decorations), that tend to lose color so quickly!\n\nIf you're growing All Around Purple with other Everlastings, consider matching it with Paper Daisy Best Mix for an Easter blend of pinks and whites studded with purple, with Eucalyptus for fragrance and color, and with Statice Soiree Rose for a lovely contrast in flower forms. In the annual bed, it's a charming accent for Dahlberg Daisy and Celosia, among others.\n\nEasy to grow in the sun-drenched garden, this plant is wonderfully resistant to both heat and drought, keeping its blooms and its fresh foliage looking neat and colorful through the worst excesses of August. A mass planting is a fabulous sight, and this Globe Amaranth also belongs in the cutting garden, where you can snip as many of the plentiful blooms as you need to fill your vases! To dry, simply cut the stem at the desired height, trim off any foliage, and hang the flower upside-down in a well-ventilated, dry, somewhat cool location.

The Pre-Raphaelites started out with the aim of revitalising British painting and sculpture by returning to the careful study of nature, which they found in medieval and early Renaissance art. But as the movement grew it came to affect all the arts -- including architecture, stained glass, textiles, furniture, wallpaper -- as well as poetry and politics. Burne-Jones and Morris were students here at Exeter College, and the Oxford they knew was a small, medieval city, bordered by meadows on one side and woods on the other. College life stimulated ideas of brotherhood which led to artistic cooperation and ultimately to blueprints for an imagined socialist future, when workers would be free from dependence on the machine and able to enjoy making and appreciating art of all kinds.\n\nThomas Combe, superintendent of the Clarendon Press, befriended Millais and Hunt and built up a fine collection of their paintings and drawings, which is now in the Ashmolean Museum. When Morris and Burne-Jones were at Exeter College from 1853, it was the Combe collection which attracted them to the Pre-Raphaelites, and particularly to Rossetti. Rossetti was the instigator of the most ambitious project the artists undertook in Oxford, the decoration of the debating chamber in the Oxford Union in 1857.\n\nJohn Ruskin came to Christ Church as a student in 1837. His volumes, Modern Painters, published anonymously by \"a graduate of Oxford\" had a profound influence on the artists, and his art criticism ensured their success. His injunction to young artists to \"go to nature -- rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing\" had a particularly strong impact on landscape painters. He kept up his links with Oxford later in life, becoming Slade Professor and establishing the Ruskin School of Drawing.", "title": "The Pre-Raphaelites in Oxford: Introduction", "publishedDate": "2011-08-23T08:48:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyWy9f9kKQg", "description": "paris gare montparnasse, rue Bertillon", "title": "Paris Gare Montparnasse GoPro timelapse", "publishedDate": "2012-01-27T23:37:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "AyX-9O0BUSQ", "description": "Wait for the last comment - Frankie Boyle at it again.

Unless you must acquire a taste for health reasons, there is no sane reason to make yourself like something. But like I mentioned, some people use the term simply to attribute it to things they like that others don't; they never had to acquire the taste, it's just their different taste.\n\nIs there anything you feel like you've acquired the taste for? For me a big one is mustard. I use to hate mustard, now I love it on burgers and hot dogs. And honey mustard with fried chicken is heaven! I guess acquiring taste is not that bad, dammit! \n\n\nDid you enjoy the rant? Should I make more like this? This was unscripted, I've done rants before, but they're usually carefully scripted.\n\nKey Words: Acquired taste, foods, eating, dining, different, weird, crazy, rant, insane, meaning, funny, humor, food, love, tasting, change, tricking your mind, smells, mind trick, enjoy, spicy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain Channel: http://youtube.com/kkortez\n\nSpanish Channel: http://youtube.com/eskkortez\n\nGaming Channel: http://youtube.com/gamezwithkkortez\n\nPersonal Channel (Spanish): http://youtube.com/kkortez3\n\nGaming Channel (Spanish): http://youtube.com/nojuegueskkortez\n\nPersonal Spanish Channel: http://www.youtube.com/ESKKortezOtravez\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/kkortez/\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/kkortez/\n\nBlog: http://kkortez.tumblr.com/\n\nGoogle Plus: http://Gplus.to/kkortez\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/kkortez\n\nPinterest: http://pinterest.com/kkortez/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcquired Taste Rant", "title": "Acquired Taste Rant", "publishedDate": "2014-06-06T18:00:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "AybzZX_vuBA", "description": "University of Wisconsin - La Crosse NCAA DIII", "title": "Shit Athletes Say to Athletic Trainers", "publishedDate": "2012-03-29T01:58:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "AycaSbl6glQ", "description": "Here it is.

Jahrhunderts: Der freie Afro-Amerikaner Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) lebt ein einfaches, aber gl\u00fcckliches Leben. Sein Geld verdient er sich als Geigenspieler. Zwei Fremde engagieren den Musiker f\u00fcr einen abendlichen Auftritt und laden ihn danach auf einen Drink ein. Als Solomon am n\u00e4chsten Morgen erwacht, muss er feststellen, dass er sich angekettet auf einem Sklavenschiff in Richtung Louisiana befindet - jeder Widerstand ist zwecklos. Er wird verkauft und muss fortan unter menschenunw\u00fcrdigen Bedingungen f\u00fcr mehrere \u00e4u\u00dferst brutale \"Master\" arbeiten - vor allem der grausame Plantagenbesitzer Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) macht ihm das Leben zur H\u00f6lle. Im Laufe seiner schier endlosen Gefangenschaft wird Solomon eines immer klarer: Wenn er seine Familie jemals wiedersehen m\u00f6chte, muss er zu au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlichen Mitteln greifen. Als er im zw\u00f6lften Jahr seines Martyriums schlie\u00dflich auf den Sklaverei-Gegner Bass (Brad Pitt) trifft, nimmt sein Leben noch einmal eine dramatische Wendung ...\n\n---\n\nTags: Twelve Years a Slave  Trailer german HD, Twelve Years a Slave  Trailer deutsch HD, Twelve Years a Slave  deutscher Trailer HD, Twelve Years a Slave  Kino-Trailer HD, Twelve Years a Slave  Kinotrailer HD, Twelve Years a Slave  Filmkritik HD\n\n---\n\nAlle Angaben ohne Gew\u00e4hr.\nUploaded with permission of / Property of:\nTM & (c) 2013 Tobis Film.

The other main video type you'll see me making are squad builders most of these are cheap and OP i love making silver hybrids and many of my subs do to so you'll be sure to find the perfect hybrid for yourself. occasionally youll find me doing a RTG or on here  as i like to vary from reviews and squad builders every so often to freshen things up a little, however im not a very good trader so there wont be many trading videos, and if you are here for pink slips and wager series with live crazy and insane rage then you have come to the wrong channel im afraid. i will occasionally upload pack openings however ill only upload one if i get a good pull, nobody wants to watch a pack opening were the best pull is Stewart downing. anyhow im starting to ramble but im sure you will agree my hybrids are beast and hopefully you'll subscribe for all the latest daily fifa 14 and when it arrives fifa 15 videos Cheers for reading and i hope to see you in my comments section soon.

It's a condition that can be at the root of numerous health complaints, and one that is treatable when properly diagnosed. In a series of four short but very informative videos Dr. Marcantel, a naturopathic doctor in Gilbert, AZ, talks about what estrogen dominance is, its causes and symptoms, how it is related to endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and PMS, and why women of all ages are often affected by the condition.\n\nWhat we are seeing in the clinic now is younger and younger women that are starting their menses at a very early age. The development of the breasts is very prominent at a very early age. They start the menses early and the menses is very irregular, so the mother does what she thinks is best--she brings them to the doctor and they get put on a birth control pill to regulate the period.\n\nWhat's happening here in the United States is that more and more of our food--estrogen and growth hormones and different hormones are being added to our food. Some milk and some dairy products have estrogen in them; some cosmetics have estrogen. So we're seeing more of an estrogen dominance in women and in men, also.\n\nBut we're seeing this starting the menses early and then large breasts and then they get put on the birth control pill which has yet more estrogen in it. Later on in life--they may stay on the pill five to ten years--and then later on in life they may have some trouble getting pregnant. We have infertility problems later on.\n\nIf they do get pregnant, when the woman delivers the baby her progesterone plummets and her estrogen stays elevated so we have, again, an estrogen dominance after giving birth. It's called postpartum blues or postpartum depression--that's when the progesterone is very low.\n\nWhen the woman goes into her forties--perimenopause, the years before menopause takes place--what happens is that if you look at a graph her estrogen is going up and down, up and down. She's having mood swings, irritability, weight gain, and the PMS symptoms are unbelievable. She's having insomnia, as well. So her estrogen is spiking and coming down low, spiking and coming down low. In the meantime, her progesterone is very low and so she is having an estrogen dominance stage there, as well.\n\nDr. Tina Marcantel, NMD\n201 W. Guadalupe Rd.

A French drain can have perforated hollow pipes along the bottom (see images) to quickly vent water that seeps down through the upper gravel or rock. French drains are common drainage systems, primarily used to prevent ground and surface water from penetrating or damaging building foundations. Alternatively, the French drain technique may be used to distribute water, such as a septic drain field at the outlet of a typical septic tank sewage treatment system. French drains are also used behind retaining walls to relieve ground water pressure.\n\nFoundation\nFrench drains are often installed around a home foundation in two different ways:\nBuried around the foundation wall on the external side of the foundation\nInstalled underneath the basement floor on the inside perimeter of the basement\nIn most homes, an external French drain or drain tile is installed around the foundation walls before the foundation soil is backfilled. It's laid on the bottom of the excavated area, and a layer of stone is laid on top. In many cases, a filter fabric is then laid on top of the stone to keep fine sediments and particles from entering. Once the drain is installed, the area is backfilled and the system is left alone unless it clogs.\nWhile an external French drain can operate for ten years or more without the need for maintenance, it's prone to clogging without any warning and can eventually lead to a flooded basement. When there is no filter fiber, sediments can make their way through the stone as years pass and clog the drain, and when the filter fabric is present, that can instead clog with sediments. It may be wise to provide cleanouts, much as is done with sanitary sewers, to provide access for inspection with a camera snake. Also, a French drain that is not installed with a sump pump counts on gravity alone to drain foundation water, and if the house is not located on a hill or near a steep incline, finding this slope can be problematic. Additionally, maintenance on an external French drain involves expensive exterior excavation, which includes removal of walkways, shrubberies, porches, gardens, and anything else along the perimeter.\nInstalling a French drain around the inside perimeter is most commonly done after the house has been built. Most commonly, this is done in response to a wet basement or right before performing a basement finishing. To install this kind of drain, the perimeter of the basement floor is jackhammered down to the footing and the cement is removed. A layer of stone is laid down, and a perforated drain pipe is laid on top of it. Water is collected from the basement wall floor joint as it enters, and a pump is installed to remove water from the house and away from the foundation.\nOnce completed, the area, save for a 2 in (5.1 cm) gap around the edge, is cemented over. This gap exists to allow water in from the basement walls. This can be installed very quickly\u2014one to two days by an experienced crew. The system is easy to maintain once installed, and the sump pump will need annual maintenance to perform properly. An interior French drain is much less likely to clog than an exterior, partially due to the fact that it is not sitting underneath several feet of soil.\nInterior French drain installation is an effective way to waterproof a basement but requires the use of a sump pump. Many contractors will install plastic sump pumps that can quickly break down or neglect to install a battery backup sump pump, making the basement vulnerable to flooding during power outages. Sump pumps should be installed with a battery backup system in a proper sump liner of 20 US gal (76 L) size or larger to prevent the sump from having too little water and turning on and off continuously.\nFrench drain has evolved significantly from its origins- starting off as a hand-dug ditch, moving on to ceramic tile, PVC pipe, and eventually to the new French drain innovations on the market like WaterGuard and Grate Channel. Each new system is able to address weaknesses of the old as the French drain continues to improve and evolve. For example, whereas Henry French used chippings of tree bark to provide anti-microbial properties, an anti-microbial additive can now be included in the material of the plastic channel.", "title": "French Drain or Perimeter Drain", "publishedDate": "2012-11-09T06:41:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "Az-u-UWJkLo", "description": "", "title": "Constituent Statement - Motor Neurone Disease", "publishedDate": "2012-07-02T08:27:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "Az08STOpW9Q", "description": "richtig toller Rap liebeskummer sehr sch\u00f6n aber traurig.

ALIEN ROCK? RUSSIA - MOSCOW - 2013 - TOP SECRET - New information provided by a worldwide network of sensors has allowed scientists to refine their estimates for the size of the UFO object that entered that atmosphere and disintegrated in the skies over Chelyabinsk, Russia, at 7:20:26 p.m. PST, or 10:20:26 p.m. EST on Feb. 14 (3:20:26 UTC on Feb. 15). \nThe estimated size of the Alien object, prior to entering Earth's atmosphere, has been revised upward from 49 feet (15 meters) to 55 feet (17 meters), and its estimated mass has increased from 7,000 to 10,000 tons. Also, the estimate for energy released during the event has increased by 30 kilotons to nearly 500 kilotons of energy released. These new estimates were generated using new data that had been collected by five additional infrasound stations located around the world -- the first recording of the event being in Alaska, over 6,500 kilometers away from Chelyabinsk. The infrasound data indicates that the event, from atmospheric entry to the meteor's airborne disintegration took 32.5 seconds. The calculations using the infrasound data were performed by Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.A look into that activities of Kapustin Yar -- a remote, top secret, military development and test facility in Russia and said to be the former Soviet Union's version of Area 51.", "title": "Russian Meteor or UFOCRASH?

A woman walking on the eastbound 10 Freeway near the La Brea onramp is tackled on the roadside shoulder by a CHP officer. The officer unleashes a barrage of punches to her face.\n\nDavid Diaz shot the video of the violent confrontation from his car. Diaz says he has no idea what spurred the beating, just that before he got his camera out he saw the officer chasing the woman around a pickup truck on the onramp.\n\nThe truck pulled away and Diaz started recording. Eventually another man runs over to assist the officer. Diaz assumed it was an undercover officer.\n\nThe CHP wouldn't talk with Eyewitness News on camera about this incident, but in a written statement, CHP said the officer ordered the woman to stop, but she ignored him. Fearing she would be hurt, the CHP says the officer tried placing her under arrest.\n\n\"A physical altercation ensued as the pedestrian continued to resist arrest, at which point a plain clothes, off duty officer assisted in applying the handcuffs,\" the CHP said in the statement.\n\nBut Diaz says he's still disturbed by the violent response of the officer... that the woman didn't seem to be fighting back and could have been subdued in a much safer manner.\n\n\"There was no weapons, it's obviously excess force at this point,\" said Diaz. \"He could have easily calmed her down. You can use strength without punching.\"\n\nThe CHP said the woman refused to give her name. She was booked as \"Jane Doe\" and taken to a local hospital for mental and physical evaluation.\n\n\nOfficer Repeatedly Hits Black Woman After Incident in Los Angeles | RAW VIDEO\nOfficer Repeatedly Hits Black Woman After Incident in Los Angeles | RAW VIDEO\nOfficer Repeatedly Hits Black Woman After Incident in Los Angeles | RAW VIDEO\nOfficer Repeatedly Hits Black Woman After Incident in Los Angeles | RAW VIDEO\n\nOfficer Beats Black Woman Senseless On Side Of Freeway\nPolice Brutality At Its Finest: California Highway Patrol Officer Beats A Black Woman Senseless On The Side Of The Freeway \nPolice Brutality At Its Finest: California Highway Patrol Officer Beats A Black Woman\nPolice Brutality At Its Finest: California Highway Patrol Officer Beats A Black Woman Senseless On The Side Of The Freeway \n[Breaking News] Police officer brutally beats a black woman on a freeway !!\n[Breaking News] Police officer brutally beats a black woman on a freeway !!
