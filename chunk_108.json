[{"_id": "5n3YEPzq18E", "description": "An insightful guide that shows how habits of behavior are formed, and how we can transform bad habits into positive behaviors in ourselves and others.\n\nSmart Change explores the psychological mechanisms that form and maintain habits in individuals and groups and offers real, accessible and actionable advice for changing habits. In an engaging narrative, Markman covers a wide range of habits, from individual behaviors like eating better and exercising regularly to work-related behaviors such as learning effectively and influencing customers' purchases. He proposes that there are five effective tools to help individuals change behavior and to help people influence the habits of the people around them:\n\n1. Tame the \"Go\" system: Identify the triggers of habits, replace old behaviors with new ones and generate specific plans to deal with obstacles.\n2. Harness the \"Stop\" system: Learn to deal with stress and other factors that hinder the development of new and positive habits.\n3. Optimize your goals. Determine the course of behavior change and how to successfully incorporate those changes for the long term.\n4. Manage your environment: Change your surroundings to dramatically reduce poor behavior and habits.\n5. Engage your Neighbors: To affect other people's behavior, understand the shared culture that creates a mutual dependency, and allows neighbors and colleagues to have a profound positive influence on the behavior of other members of their community.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1c7STO4", "title": "Psychological Distance: Smart Change, Art Markman, PhD", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T22:30:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "5n42FksUvZ0", "description": "", "title": "PUMAS ARAUCA CAMPEONES DE SURAMERICANO PORRISTAS 2012", "publishedDate": "2012-06-07T13:30:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "5n4dzzh3RQ0", "description": "Daytona Bike Week 2014 Main Street Going Wild.

In this way, they go for a help to many places like financial institutions who can help them in getting out of this problem. The moment is not to sit and think for the past but to proceed ahead. They can get a help from banks in the way getting the bad credit personal loans, which will be effective during the situation. Do I build my credit? A person asks this question from himself. With this loan, he will get the answer to his questions.     \n\nMany businesses are helping the people who are facing the problem of bad credit. This is because many of the people faced this problem in their past and through this way, they want others too to get out of. it. If a person in your knowledge is also facing the same problem, then ask him that what he is doing to come out of the problem. With getting loan, a person can do all the things in a fine manner. He can repay his debts and complete those things which he wants to do. After getting the loan, the deductions will come out from his salary as a part of installments and it will be completed under a certain time.     \n\nTo get these loans, a person has to go for some paperwork along with some documents that will be asked from those financial institutions where a person is going. This is a time consuming process but mostly banks offer this technique to the curious customers who are not able to get better understandability for getting loan. The best option available in today's time a person can search the information on computer as there are many websites providing this service to the people.\n\nOn the websites, a person will come to know about the things that what are the amount he can get easily and are the interest rate. This is a convenient option and through this way, they are knowing much about the loan process. After getting the good understanding about loan process and other things, he can apply for the loan. With this way, he can also get the answer of the question do I build my credit? These loans also play in building a better credit history of a person if he takes a small amount of loan and repay it on time without being a defaulter.    \n\nFinancial advice for students:\n\n\u2022 Children must understand the requirement of their parents and must cut short their expenses if possible.\n\n\u2022 They must save an amount with them at a secret place, or at banks from where they can get money if they have to go for some requirements.\n\n\u2022 They must sit with their parents, plan a budget, and discuss the general and enormous expenses in detail.

There is also a fishkeeping industry, as a branch of agriculture.\nFreshwater fishkeeping is by far the most popular branch of the hobby, with even small pet stores often selling a variety of freshwater fish, such as goldfish, guppies, and angelfish. While most freshwater aquaria are set up as community tanks containing a variety of peaceful species, single-species breeding aquaria are also popular. Livebearing fish such as mollies and guppies are among the species that are most easily raised in captivity, but aquarists also regularly breed numerous other species, including many types of cichlid, catfish, characin, and killifish.\nMany fishkeepers create freshwater aquascapes where the focus is on aquatic plants as well as on the fish. These aquariums include the \"Dutch Aquarium\", in reference to the pioneering work carried out by European aquarists in designing these sorts of tanks. In recent years, one of the most active advocates of the heavily planted aquarium is the Japanese aquarist Takashi Amano.\nGarden ponds are in some ways similar to freshwater aquaria, but are usually much larger and exposed to the ambient climatic conditions. In the tropics, tropical fish can be kept in garden ponds, but in the cooler regions temperate zone species such as goldfish, koi, and orfe are kept instead.\nFish have been raised as food in pools and ponds for thousands of years. Brightly colored or tame specimens of fish in these pools have sometimes been valued as pets rather than food. Many other cultures kept fish for both functional and decorative purposes.\nAncient Sumerians were known to keep wild-caught fish in ponds, before preparing them for meals. Depictions of the sacred fish of Oxyrhynchus kept in captivity in rectangular temple pools have been found in ancient Egyptian art.\nSimilarly, throughout Asia has experienced a long history of stocking rice paddies with freshwater fish suitable for eating, including various types of catfish and cyprinid. Selective breeding of carp into today's popular and completely domesticated koi and goldfish is believed to have begun over 2,000 years ago in Japan and China, respectively. The Chinese brought goldfish indoors during the Song Dynasty to enjoy them in large ceramic vessels.\nIn Medieval Europe, carp pools were a standard feature of estates and monasteries, providing an alternative to meat on feast days when meat could not be eaten for religious reasons.\nMarine fish have been similarly valued for centuries. Wealthy Romans kept lampreys and other fish in salt water pools. Tertullian reports that Asinius Celer paid 8000 sesterces for a particularly fine mullet. Cicero reports that the advocate Quintus Hortensius wept when a favored specimen died, while  Rather cynically, he referred to these ancient fishkeepers as the Piscinarii, the \"fish-pond owners\" or \"fish breeders\", for example when saying that ...the rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me.", "title": "Aquarium", "publishedDate": "2010-11-06T14:30:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "5nktILjcWHg", "description": "Find out where a postgrad degree in Statistics can take you.

It can take place in a cage or on a field, like we are right now.  But the idea behind the drill is that I am going to load back.  As I go back, Coach Casey is going to toss a ball into the air.  From here I'm going to drive down through the ball.  It's really important that I get a good load, that I get behind this ball because you will see, as the drill goes on, the speeds will change.

A lot of people don't know that Red Brick Brewing Company was founded as the Atlanta Brewing Company on September 29th, 1993. As the longest operating craft brewery in the state of Georgia, we have a rich brewing tradition, but sometimes our basic math skills are lacking. Allow me to explain. One of our biggest traditions is oak aging beer in celebration of our anniversary. In July 2012 we launched 17th Anniversary Ale as the 3rd release in our Brick Mason series. It was a wonderful beer, oak aged in bourbon barrels. It seemed everyone loved it, and we were all very proud of delivering such a successful beer. However, one day someone did the math...1993 + 17 years...does not equal 2012. Somewhere along the line we lost a couple of years in our anniversary series.\n\nWe had no idea how that happened, but it reminded us of the story Rip van Winkle, written by Washington Irving. In this story, the main character, Rip van Winkle fell asleep and woke up twenty years later, having missed the American Revolution, the death of his wife, the marriage of his daughter and the birth of his grandson. Red Brick didn't quite sleep for 20 years, but ironically 2013 is our 20th anniversary! Needless to say, Red Brick felt a link between our lost years and the sleepy old guy whom we honor in effigy on the Lost Years bottle label and the 4pk carton.

Played herein by John Neville, the baron is seen quelling a war that he himself started, flying into the stratosphere on the back of a cannonball, ballooning to the moon, exploring the innards of a volcano, being swallowed by a whale....In short, all of Munchausen's fabulous lies are here presented as \"truth,\" played out in full view of nonplussed witnesses Eric Idle, Charles McKeown, Jack Purvis, and Sarah Polley. Fringe benefits include several loving medium shots of jaybird-naked Uma Thurman as Boticelli's Venus and an extended unbilled cameo by Robin Williams -- that is, by the head of Robin Williams -- as the King of the Moon. Filmed under considerable duress on a budget eventually exceeding 45 million dollars, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen never quite caught on with moviegoers, though it has enjoyed a lucrative afterlife on videocassette.\n\n\"sarah polley\",\"john neville\",\"michael polley\",\"tony smart\",\"terry gilliam\",\"cannon videos\",\"gun videos\",\"scythe videos\",\"action adventure\",adventures,\"british movies\",fantasy,\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"jake eberts\",\"stratton leopold\",\"thomas schhly\",\"david tomblin\",\"ray cooper\",\"aggression videos\",\"madness videos\",\"risk videos\",\"violence videos\",\"war videos\",\"battlefield videos\",\"sally salt\",gunner,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++++918,/m/06f23n,/m/0bhrm8n,/m/02s5v5", "title": "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (3/8) Movie CLIP - The Cannonball Ride (1988) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-25T20:50:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5oOYq93ZKMI", "description": "Peacock Mantis Shrimp at Floris ES catching and eating an emerald crab.

Is for the people, we are equal, we've been through the evil like knivel, it was lethal, \n\nWith drawn swords, we killed hordes and the reward, we all got our own thrones, we some mother fucking lords, \n\n\nVerse 2.\n\nWe ain't got time like the white rabbit, we ain't got time like Henry Hamilton, arm gadget, \n\nWe all like a grain of sand in a hour glass, some drop faster than others and yes some surpass, \n\nYour the only one that holds the ability to think clearly, it's merely a question of what you truly love dearly, \n\nWhether friends or family, star gazing from balconies, love in reality will create ultimate rhapsody, \n\nI ain't one to talk blasphemy, I believe there is a god but could be a dog, quite naturally, \n\nHow do we really know god was a human being, do you believe everything you read, no then stop agree in',\n\nYou'll always be king in one persons mind, son, daughter, wife or husband, it's just the way of man kind, \n\nWith drawn swords, we kill hordes and the reward, the reign supreme like we some mother fucking lords.", "title": "Ivan Ooze - Lord$", "publishedDate": "2014-08-18T07:56:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5oc0vk_IJqs", "description": "I decided to try and learn iMovie... yesterday.

In addition to its military role, gates through the wall served as customs posts. A significant portion of the wall still exists and can be followed on foot along the Hadrian's Wall Path. It is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern England and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.\n\nHadrian's Wall was built by the Romans to protect their colony in England from the Pictish tribes in Scotland. It stretches for 87 miles across the north of England from the Irish Sea to the North Sea in the counties of Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear.\n\nBuilt by Roman soldiers in the 2nd century A.D., only stretches of the wall are still visible, but the wealth of archaeological research has resulted in an almost unparalleled cluster of museums and excavations.\n\nHadrian's Wall was one of Ancient Rome's fortified borders, which gave the late Roman Empire security against the barbarians at its gates. Constructed and later garrisoned by soldiers drawn from all over the Roman world, the wall preserves an immense amount of military and civilian day-to-day life.\n\nThere is now a recognised National Trail that follows (with slight deviations) the whole length of the wall from Wallsend to the Solway Firth. The path is relatively easy going for most of its route, with the notable exception of the middle section around Steel Rigg. Here the path rises and falls steeply as it follows the escarpment. This section is however regarded as the most beautiful.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nWe would like to hear from you!

It was a great article. I've made some notes and bookmarked it -- it might come in handy someday...\n\nHowever, there was one thing that I didn't like. They claimed that spun content was dead. From now on, they said, you should manually rewrite *ALL* your articles. Is this the end of Internet Marketing as we know it?!\n\nNot for me. I need TONS of content every day. I publish it on my 100+ websites. I build support sites. I set up Web 2.0 sites, I do social bookmarking... It's simply IMPOSSIBLE to manually write that much content. Day in and day out.\n\nLuckily, the author of the article is VERY wrong. It's true that *poorly* spun content is dead. Google can detect it. Nothing new here.\n\nBut, if the content is spun with the ENL semantic spinning algorithm, Google can't detect it. Why? Because it looks just like a native speaker had rewritten it. Here is an example of ENL algorithm's work:\n\n-------------------------\nORIGINAL TEXT:\n-------------------------\nJohn can relax and read a book because his kids can book the vacation for him.\nOnce it's booked, he will enjoy an excellent movie and drink wine, beer, or whiskey.\n\n-------------------------\nGENERATED SPUN\nVARIATIONS: (!!!)\n-------------------------\nSince his kids can easily schedule the vacation for him, John can read a book and unwind.\nHe will definitely enjoy an impressive film and drink draught beer, whiskey, or red wine once it's reserved.\n\nYou can find more examples here:http://bloghabit.com/spinrewriter\n\n\nNo Copyscape issues. No duplicate content penalty. Completely readable. FREE of charge. Without any work. All thanks to Spin Rewriter.\n \nStill, there's more! The guys over at Spin Rewriter have just launched version 5.0. With even more great features -- with a brand new article generating algorithm, Spin Rewriter now makes sure that only the most UNIQUE articles are generated. You may want to take a look at it:\n\nhttp://bloghabit.com/spinrewriter\n\n\nI'm using it every day. It helps me generate more than 200 unique articles every day. In just 10 minutes. At no cost.

This '78 Pace Car is absolutely beautiful and in extremely nice shape, as the previous owner swears up and down that it has 31,000 original miles! Although there is no documentation to prove this, we don't doubt his claim based on the overall condition of this car. Paint and decals are both excellent with no visible flaws. Seats look brand new with no cracking in the leather whatsoever. Carpet looks nearly new as well, showing absolute minimal wear. Center console and gauges show excellent also. Steering wheel cover looks to be original with the slightest signs of wear in one or two places but is still nice and tight with no loose threads or cracking. Rear spoiler shows just a hint of the \"waviness\" that is typical in 1978-79 cars with this option. The engine compartment is nearly clean enough to eat off of -- someone really spent some time detailing under the hood of this car. Ignition shielding is in place, and the only obvious non-original piece is the A/C compressor, which is still a Delco unit, but shows a newer-style label. The polished aluminum slotted wheels show very nicely and are wrapped in BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires with about 90% tread remaining. This Pace Car comes loaded with features including tilt-n-tele, power windows, power locks, power antenna, power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, rear defrost, sport mirrors, AM/FM stereo with CB radio and rear speakers.\n\nFREE 2 YEAR/50K ADDITIONAL MILE WARRANTY, GOOD AT ANY REPAIR FACILITY NATIONWIDE! \n\nPhotos: http://www.buyavette.net/1385%201978%20Corvette%20Pace%20Car%20For%20Sale.php\n\nPlease call us at (770)414-5552 or email sales@buyavette.net for more information on this car.

One species, Meleagris gallopavo, commonly known as the Wild Turkey, is native to the forests ofNorth America. The other species, Meleagris ocellata, known as the Ocellated Turkey, is native to the forests of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nThe domestic turkey is a descendant of the Wild Turkey and features prominently in the menu of the U.S. and Canadian holidays of Thanksgiving and that of Christmas in many countries.\nTurkeys are classed in the taxonomic order of Galliformes. Within this order they are relatives of the family/subfamily Tetraonidae (grouse). Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak, and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called asnood. With wingspans of 1.5--1.8 metres (4.9--5.9 ft), the turkeys are by far the largest birds in the open forests in which they live. As with many galliform species, the female (hen) is smaller and is much less colorful than the male (tom or gobbler).\nHistory and naming\nWhen Europeans first encountered turkeys in the America Continent they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of guineafowl (Numididae), also known as Turkey fowl (or Turkey hen and Turkey cock) from their importation to Central Europe through Turkey, and that name, shortened to just the name of the country, stuck as the name of the bird.[1][2] The confusion between these kinds of birds from related but different families is also reflected in the scientific name for the turkey genus:meleagris (\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03af\u03c2) is Greek for guineafowl. The domesticated turkey is attributed to Aztecagriculture, which addressed one subspecies of Meleagris gallopavo local to the present day states of Jalisco and Guerrero.[3]\nThe names for M. gallopavo in other languages also frequently reflect its exotic origins, seen from an Old World viewpoint, and add to the confusion about where turkeys actually came from. The many references to India seen in common names go back to a combination of two factors: first, the genuine belief that the newly-discovered Americas were in fact a part of Asia, and second, the tendency during that time to attribute exotic animals and foods to a place that symbolized far-off, exotic lands. The latter is reflected in terms like \"Muscovy Duck\" (which is from South America, notMuscovy). This was a major reason why the name Turkey fowl stuck to Meleagris rather than to the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris): the Ottoman Empire represented the exotic East.[original research?]\nThe name given to a group of turkeys is a rafter, although they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as a gobble or flock.[4]\nSeveral other birds which are sometimes called turkeys are not particularly closely related: theAustralian Brush-turkey is a megapode, and the bird sometimes known as the \"Australian Turkey\" is in fact the Australian Bustard, a gruiform. The bird sometimes called a Water Turkey is actually anAnhinga (Anhinga rufa).\n[edit]Flight\nWhile large domesticated turkeys are generally unable to fly, smaller, lighter domesticated turkeys known as heritage turkeys and wild turkeys can fly. In domesticated turkeys the ability to fly depends directly on weight, while even heavy adult wild turkeys can fly well enough to avoid predators by taking off and flying up to 100 yards (91 m) and perching in tree branches. Turkey poults (chicks) cannot fly for the first two weeks after hatching.\n[edit]Fossil record\nMany turkeys have been described from fossils. The Meleagrididae are known from the Early Miocene (c. 23 mya) onwards, with the extinctgenera Rhegminornis (Early Miocene of Bell, U.S.) and Proagriocharis (Kimball Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lime Creek, U.S.). The former is probably a basal turkey, the other a more contemporary bird not very similar to known turkeys; both were much smaller birds. A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to Meleagris is known from the Late Miocene of Westmoreland County, Virginia.[5] In the modern genus Meleagris, a considerable number of species have been described, as turkey fossils are robust, fairly often found, and turkeys show much variation among individuals. Many of these supposed fossilized species are now considered junior synonyms. One, the well-documented California Turkey Meleagris californica,[6] became extinct recently enough to have been hunted by early human settlers[7] and it is believed its demise was due to the combined pressures of climate change at the end of the last glacial period and hunting.[8] The modern species and the California Turkey seem to have diverged approximately one million years ago.", "title": "Turkey Or Pabo ni Estong", "publishedDate": "2010-08-02T10:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5p7-tw9CHRA", "description": "Early English dance tunes from 16th century played by Janette Clare on descant recorder, at open mic session, Cellar Bar, Stamford Arts Centre, UK, on 3rd October 2008.

This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

Well, it seams not a lot. What we think we know is constantly changing in light of new discoveries.\n\nA recent carbon dating performed on a pyramid in Bosnia, proves it to be at least 25 thousand years old.\n\nMost scientists and historians however believe that human civilization started about 5,000 years ago with the Sumerians and Babylonians. That is, until artifacts were found, which predate them. These discoveries suggest, that there was a pre-historical civilization around the world- one that must have been highly advanced.\n\nTwo Italian archaeologists, Dr. Ricarrdo Brett and Niccolo Bisconti found a piece of organic material on the Bosnian Pyramid.\n\nThey were able to carbon-date the material and with it the pyramid itself. This carbon dating puts the pyramid 20 thousand years before the Sumerian and Babylonian \"civilizations.\"\n\nWhen the Bosnian Pyramid was first discovered in 2005, researchers could only measure the age of the topsoil covering the pyramid, which is about 12 thousand years old.\n\n[Dr. Semir Osmanagich, Researcher of Bosnian Pyramid]:\n\"The organic materials found on the Sun Pyramid and biological analysis are telling us that the pyramids are older than 12 thousand five hundred years. The oldest on the planet.\"\n\nYou may be wondering how such a huge pyramid could have remained undiscovered in Europe for so many years. Until its discovery it was just known as Visoko hill. That's right, they thought it was a hill, which is not surprising considering it's size, and the fact that it is covered with topsoil and vegetation.\n\nNo entrance to the pyramid has been discovered so far, but an intricate network of tunnels underneath the pyramid are slowly being uncovered.\n\n[Dr. Semir Osmanagich, Researcher of Bosnian Pyramid]:\n\"Under the valley of the pyramids in Bosnia, there is the most extensive underground tunnel network. It runs for tens of miles. And in those tunnels, the discovery of huge ceramic blocks reaching 18-thousand pounds in mass.\"\n\nThere are still scientists and archaeologists who appose the idea of ancient civilizations before five thousand years ago.\n\nHowever this latest finding supports the theory that highly advanced civilizations existed before the beginning of our current one.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://english.ntdtv.com\nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision\nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Naquatica: Bosnia Pyramid Carbon Dated 25 Thousand Years Old", "publishedDate": "2012-10-11T19:27:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "5pf5QKz736o", "description": "LOL Heather1337 & I being silly", "title": "What Cosplayers do in their spare time...", "publishedDate": "2013-08-13T00:59:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "5pf6JYB8xPU", "description": "Casebook Of Clinical Geropsychology.

First off all sorry about my poor english. So lets begin.\n\nI'm now 25 years old. I started minoxidil 4 months ago. There are no beard problem in my whole family, furthermore they have very strong beards (my father, my 2 brothers, uncles, etc). Also my 90 years old grandfather has very strong white beard. I am the only one have this problem in my family. 3 years ago, i made some tests in hospital and didn't seem anything wrong in this tests except vitamin B12 (hormones etc. are fine). It seems my vitamin B12 level is very low. Doctor told me that i need use vitamin B12 injection every month for my whole life. So for 3 years i am using vitamin B12 (injection) every month. Before that i have no beard except a little mustache. After using vitamin B12, my mustache and jaw area beard started to grow. But that was not effect on my cheek area. So i decided to start minoxidil and i am using minoxidil for 4 months as i wrote in the beginning.\nThe first picture is after using it 2 months long.\n\nI used it 2 times a day.

Hey everyone, welcome back to Clevver Music! Last night was the much talked about tribute episode to Cory Monteith and his character Finn Hudson. The episode kicked off right away with the New Directions dressed in black singing \"Seasons of Love,\" with past Glee club members Kurt, Mercedes, Santana, Puck, and Mike. They address Finn's death through Kurt as he says, \"Everyone wants to talk about how he died, too, but who cares? One moment in his whole life. I care more about how he lived.\" Then fast forward a few weeks later and everyone has returned to the choir room to honor Finn through music as their assignment for the week. Mercedes is the first one to sing and she chose \"I'll Stand by You.\" You might recognize this song because she explains it as the song that Finn sang to Beth's sonogram when he thought he was going to be a father in season 1. Kurt, Burt and Finn's mom start to clean Finn's room and Kurt keeps Finn's jacket, remembering him almost like Superman when he wore it. Sam and Artie then sing \"Fire and Rain,\" which ends with Santana leaving the auditorium and confronting Sue about her hatred towards Finn. Santana sings The Band Perry's, \"If I Die Young\", take a look.\nBut before Santana is done singing she breaks down and runs out of the choir room unable to finish. Kurt consoles Santana by giving her Finn's letterman jacket, only to have someone steal it from her. Puck and Coach Beiste console each other in the locker room, and he sings \"No Surrender\" for his best friend Cory. He later announces he will join the Air Force in order to move on. We can just feel the bromance, and it's heartbreaking! Santana then apologizes to Sue, and Sue reveals that she's heartbroken over the loss saying \"There's no lesson here. There's no happy ending. There's just nothing. He's gone.\" Rachel finally makes her appearance near the end of the episode when she sees Finn's locker shrine. She makes a beautiful speech and then sings a special song her and Finn shared, \"Make You Feel My Love.\" Here's a look.\nThis was also a personal song that Lea and Cory shared in real life. Rachel makes a plaque of Finn to hang in the choir room, and explains to Mr. Schue that she and Finn were going to end up together because \"He was my person.\" The episode ends by revealing that Mr. Schue was the one who stole Finn's jacket from Santana and he finally breaks down in mourning. We thought this Cory tribute was beautiful, simple and perfect. Let us know what you thought of Finn's tribute. Is there a song that you thought should've made it into the episode?

The initial DS version, released on December 18, 2008 in Japan, was made available in two versions, one with anime-style video scenes, and the other having Pixar-like 3D video scenes. While the video's featured different art styles, the two versions maintained the same story and gameplay. On March 7, 2013, a third version, a remake titled Tales of Hearts R, was released on the PlayStation Vita. In early 2014, it was announced that the Vita version would have an English language release in North America and Europe between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015.\nTales of Hearts follows a similar gameplay structure to other titles in the series. The player visits various towns in which they can talk to various non-playable characters, buy items, and progress the story. \nRecovery Stones replaces the common cooking system of the series. The recovery stone can be set to be used at various times during battle to recover HP, or for other effects. When the stone is used it consumes \"Heal Energy\", which can be recharged at a recovery stone shop, or in dungeons. At the shops the player can also pay to increase the number of effects that can be set to the stone, increase the amount of heal energy, or buy more effects that the recovery stone can use.\nBy going to accessory shops, the player can make different accessories through materials found throughout the game, all with different effects or benefits. Accessories can also be turned back into the materials used to create it for other uses.\nCustomization in the game is handled through the \"Soma Build\" system, through which the player upgrades the Soma (weapons) of the party and control their growth. The player can use raw materials found throughout the game to learn various abilities, or \"Soma Skills\" (of which there are four types: Parameter, Battle, Action, and Support), or to add various stat bonuses to a character.\nWhen Soma Build is performed on a weapon enough times, the weapon can go through a process called \"Soma Evolve\", in which the Soma will take on a new form and name, and unlock new Soma Skills and stat bonuses.\nThroughout the game there are various events in which the player can choose different options towards another character, called a \"Soma Link\". Through certain choices it will cause the outcomes of scenes to change, and the character may gain points towards their \"Soma Link Value\". Once it becomes high enough, the character can learn various skills.\nBy using Soma, the party can go into one's heart, called a \"Spir Link\". The person's mind is like a labyrinth, called a \"Spir Maze\", a place with various rare items and other things to find. There are chances to go into these during both the main scenario and with NPCs throughout the game.\nZerom, monsters that eat individuals 'Spiria' (or 'hearts'), have spread around the world. Therefore weapons called 'Somas', were created in order to banish all Zerom. People who possess Somas manage to enter someone's Spir-Maze or Heart Maze. Amber Hearts, who happens to be the vessel for Richea Spodune, was in search of a Soma together with her brother, Jadeite Hearts. Along the way an enemy, Incarose assaults them, but they manage to escape to the sea. They are brought into a little village of Seeble, where they meet the protagonist, Shing Meteoryte. There Shing took care of both of them and introduced them to the Soma they are looking for.\n\nDuring that time, Incarose makes an appearance once more; this time she manages to attack Amber and Shing's grandfather, Zeks. Since Shing has a Soma he intends to go within Amber's Spir Maze in order to cure her. But, the plan does not go well and Amber's Spiria ends up shattered into pieces and placed everywhere around the world. From there Shing's adventure of recovering Amber's Spiria shards begins. During that time Shing befriends several others and together has to overcome many obstacles and antagonists who are also looking for Spiria. During his travels, Shing discovers more and more about the world, Richea, Spiria, Zerom, etc.\nEventually, it is revealed that Creed Graphite, the ruler of Quartzia, was hidden away within Shing and is eventually drawn out by Incarose. The ancient defense system, Gardenia, is revived, though Creed is shocked at its nature. With the aid of Calcedony and his Spiria, Shing and the party are able to infiltrate Gardenia and defeat Creed, but through sacrifice. As a result, Gardenia is destroyed, and Creed and Flora are killed in the process.", "title": "Dungeon Theme - Tales of Hearts R Soundtrack", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T18:52:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5qHXr5C5Hhw", "description": "Hello YouTube, I hope you enjoy this drawing video as much as i enjoyed making it.

Pintor italiano (Florencia 1445 - 1510), es una de las grandes figuras del Renacimiento por su delicado dibujo y excepcional colorido. Muy valorado en la actualidad, Sandro Botticelli no se cuenta entre los grandes innovadores del Renacimiento, sino que se inscribe m\u00e1s bien en un grupo de pintores que rehuy\u00f3 el realismo a ultranza y se inclin\u00f3 por un estilo basado en la delicadeza, la gracia y un cierto sentimentalismo.\n\nFue disc\u00edpulo de Fra Filippo Lippi, trabaj\u00f3 con el pintor y grabador Antonio del Pollaiuolo, del que aprendi\u00f3 el dominio de la l\u00ednea, y adem\u00e1s recibi\u00f3 gran influencia de Andrea del Verrocchio. \n\nBotticelli se inicia en el arte de la orfebrer\u00eda desplegando su habilidad para el dise\u00f1o decorativo de las formas. Alrededor del  1461-1462, a los 17 a\u00f1os, entr\u00f3 en el taller de Fra Filippo Lippi, cuya instrucci\u00f3n dur\u00f3 unos cinco a\u00f1os. All\u00ed aprendi\u00f3  la composici\u00f3n, fabricaci\u00f3n y preparaci\u00f3n de las pinturas, moliendo piedras y aun\u00e1ndolas con la medida justa de aglutinantes, asimil\u00f3 las t\u00e9cnicas del fresco y la pintura sobre la tabla.  Filippo Lippi,  fue el principal maestro e inspirador de la obra de Botticelli, comenzando su trayectoria art\u00edstica con obras de tem\u00e1tica religiosa, en particular v\u00edrgenes, que denotan un gran vigor compositivo y desplegando su habilidad para el dise\u00f1o decorativo de las formas.\n\nEn 1470, Botticelli, que contaba ya con un taller propio, se introdujo en el c\u00edrculo de los M\u00e9dicis, para los que realiz\u00f3 sus obras m\u00e1s famosas. Pas\u00f3 parte de su vida pintando retratos y cuadros por encargo de las familias prominentes de Florencia, y realiz\u00f3 obras religiosas, de las cuales destacan sus madonnas y pinturas al fresco realizadas en la Capilla Sixtina del Vaticano.\n\nUn primo de Lorenzo el Magn\u00edfico, Pier Francesco de M\u00e9dicis, le encarg\u00f3 la alegor\u00eda de La primavera y tambi\u00e9n, al parecer, El nacimiento de Venus y Palas y el centauro El hecho de que en 1481 fuera llamado a Roma para decorar al fresco la Capilla Sixtina junto con otros tres grandes maestros, hace suponer que ya gozaba de un gran prestigio.\n\n A su regreso a Florencia realiz\u00f3 obras, como la Natividad m\u00edstica, m\u00e1s solemnes y redundantes, probablemente influido por la predicaci\u00f3n tremendista de Savonarola y bell\u00edsimos dibujos para un manuscrito de la Divina Comedia de Dante.\n\nEclipsado por las grandes figuras del siglo XVI italiano, Botticelli ha permanecido ignorado durante siglos, hasta la recuperaci\u00f3n de su figura y su obra a mediados del siglo XIX. Su estilo se perpetu\u00f3 en cierto modo a trav\u00e9s de los artistas formados en su taller, entre ellos el hijo de Filippo Lippi, Filippino Lippi.\n\nM\u00fasica Padre Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria - Ave Mar\u00eda - Coro de Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a - Director Od\u00f3n Alonso.\n\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Luis_de_Victoria", "title": "Sandro Botticelli \"Madonnas\" - Ave Mar\u00eda: Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria", "publishedDate": "2012-06-03T14:27:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5qToly3V0Xo", "description": "http://www.canvassking.com  Confused on what time of day to canvass?

It is produced by animals of certain species. A roar is usually made using the hyoid, a small bone which is not completely rigid in adults. Animals roar for various reasons, including territorial proclamation, communication with other members, and anger. Additionally, the roar of an animal such as a lion is used in the process of finding and competing for a mate.\n\nThe roar pattern is composed of three overall segments - a beginning segment sounding like moaning, a middle segment with low frequency loud tones and a final segment which sounds much like grunting. The lion's roar is familiar to many through its inclusion in the MGM opening sequence. This roar segment consists only of the middle portion of the roar, omitting the first and last portions", "title": "LION ROAR!!!!

Pause the video to read the individual parts of the screen. Watch this in high definition for the best result.\n\nWhile I could have used a screen recording program to capture this demonstration,  I also wanted to convey just how impressively quiet the Powermate Eco computer really is. The camcorder's microphone preamplifier and the background noise of the room are louder than the computer!\n\n(I also find it worth noting that the CamStudio installer now bundles shovelware, and not all of it can be clearly rejected. I didn't want to end up with unwanted software on this system, so I bailed out on the installer.)\n\nSome of you may be wondering what makes this computer special. I'll be going over it in more detail with a future video. For now, the two key aspects of this system's design were a focus on its being much kinder to the environment than usual and its use of a Transmeta CPU. It's also built around an all-in-one design.\n\nWhile making electronics that are less damaging to the environment and keeping them out of landfills are big goals today, neither of those goals were a big deal when NEC made this computer. They were ahead of their time in working to reduce the energy consumption, as well as removing certain toxins from the plastics and circuit boards. This computer is completely fanless \n\nThe Transmeta CPU was a radically different idea. Instead of having a conventional hard coded set of instructions, it ran x86 code by translating it to the processor's native instructions using a technology known as \"code morphing\". This allowed the CPU to try and reorder instructions to run more efficiently and also allowed for future processor instructions to be added by simply updating the translation software. More conventional CPUs would have to be replaced with a new unit to accomplish the same thing. Of course, your computer vendor had to update the core system software in order to pass those new features along. In theory, it would have also been possible for the Transmeta CPU to run code for other types of processors as well.\n\nI'd wanted to tinker with something having a Transmeta CPU for a long time. Most computers using that CPU were ultra portable laptops. I wanted something with a desktop form factor. The NEC Powermate Eco is *very* solidly built. Unfortunately, performance is best described as \"pedestrian\" even under the most optimistic scenarios. Modern software is really a lot more than it wants to deal with.\n\nThis computer seems to have been a flop in the marketplace, probably due to its very high cost and lackluster performance as compared to even budget-oriented computers of the time. Transmeta ultimately withered away in 2009.", "title": "NEC Powermate Eco Demonstration Program", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T17:21:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5qxXGr-12c0", "description": "To offer some more unconventional style inspiration, we partnered with Stone Fox Bride\u2014a New York-based showroom that manages to be both high-fashion and giddily laid-back when it comes to brides and their wedding dresses\u2014to help brides-to-be realize that it is possible to dress like yourself and still look fabulous (and bridal!) on your wedding day.

According to founder Molly Guy, you can use silk flowers if you'd prefer to skip buying fresh ones! \n\nStep 1: Take your wire and wrap it around your head to establish the size for your crown.\n\nStep 2: Once you've measured your head, take some greenery and leaves to wrap around the base of the wire to cover up any wire that's showing. Hold it close to the wire of the crown and slowly start to wrap.\n\nStep 3: Once you have all the green set up, you can start to get creative by adding more flowers. Attaching the flowers is just as easy as attaching the greenery at the beginning -- you just want to wrap tightly with your green wire to secure it in place.\n\nStep 4: You don't have to go the whole way around the crown with the flowers.
