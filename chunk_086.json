Please MAKE THIS VIDEO GO VIRAL and share it, the world needs to know! We need to break free from energy dependencies and reclaim our sovereignty. The material realm reflects the consciousness of those who reside within it...we're making progress as a people! \n\n**NOTE:  We had to disable commenting because of paid shills manipulating the discussion, we apologize for the inconvenience, but not for the shills.  xoxo\n\n~Nathan & Aline\n\n* * * * * * \n\nThe Info from the Creator Course Facebook Page (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=507205819406086), the original content creator of the video.\n\nWhoa, Tesla's technology has come back to life! This video is a celebration of quantum energy powering on and free energy building! It's the first step in a major direction!\n\nThis is a short clip of the QEG reaching resonance for the first time in the One People Community Aouchtam workshop. The bulbs represent 500 watts of power. \n\nHow the QEG works:\nFirst we use a starting power source, such as an outlet or a crank to power the 1 horsepower motor. This motor spins the rotor in the generator core. The unique oscillator circuitry configuration in the generator core causes resonance to occur. Once the core achieves this resonance it can produce up to 10KW of power, which can then be run through an inverter to power the motor that spins the rotor. You can then unplug the motor from the original power source and the generator will power itself. This is STILL IN PROCESS, and yet to be achieved by this QEG in Aouchtam.\n\nHere's to infinite available energy for all!\n\n* * * * * \n\nTo download the plans for this device, see this link: http://hopegirl2012.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/qeg-user-manual-3-25-14.pdf", "title": "QEG Free Energy Generator Demonstration", "publishedDate": "2014-05-03T13:40:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4OECOu4Ve48", "description": "", "title": "Illusion of Gaia: Pyramid ~ Hieroglyph Hitbox", "publishedDate": "2014-01-26T06:15:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "4OEUspIHZEM", "description": "Pork Ribs\n\n\n\nMusic:\n\"Deae Lunae\" by Makkon", "title": "How To Convert a Vegetarian: Part 2", "publishedDate": "2013-06-01T17:03:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "4OEoX7kJq8o", "description": "They describe themselves as \u201cpopmusicy-seriocomic-mashparodic-stereophonic-LOUD-vaudevillian-sketchcabaret-throwbackcurrent-oldfangled-newfashioned-bapsbotty-infotainment\". \n\nA catchy phrase!\n\nBasically, they do fun versions of pop songs whilst looking fabulous. \n\nThey're performing their show \u2018Just Too Much\u2019 at the Forum in Kentish Town on the 12th of November, but they stopped off at our studios for a live performance first!", "title": "Cabaret!

Some reasons for this is to blend in with the World, avoid police, thieves, and deceive racing opponents then beat them in a race.\n\nIn a pure sense, sleepers don't resemble speed and are hard to distinguish from common traffic.\nHowever, this is a very generalized idea and leaves much room for debate. Because, many consider a sleeper car, simply one that is much faster than it looks.\n\nFor example. A 90s Corvette, hardly a sleeper, yet when modified to double it's factory horsepower the Corvette is much faster than it's outdated looks suggest. example 2: Honda Civic sedan, some hints of speed with visual upgrades such as a carbon fiber hood and racing wheels, has weight reductions to an already light car and say 400 horsepower-equals very very fast. This Corvette and Civic should be in a category called: Semi-Sleepers. They should not be mixed with the pure sleepers, but they will deserve some respect when they wake up.\n\nSo remember, if you think your car is a sleeper, but your friends disagree, maybe your car is a Semi-sleeper? This is not scientific, and there will be some overlap but I think we get the basic idea.\nAnd lets not forget...Some car manufacturers produce sleepers right off the assembly line. Some examples are: the Mercedes AMG cars and more specifically the BMW M5. These are super high end performance cars built around an average German sedan.  You guys are welcome to list more factory sleepers that come to mind in the comment section. Subaru Sti and Mitsubishi Evolution perhaps? \nSo what is NOT a sleeper? Usually, non-sleeper cars are no faster than their looks suggest. This means most every day cars are not sleepers. Also, visually hard core looking cars, such as this drag car are obviously not sleepers as there wouldn't be much surprise if it pulled a stunning 9 second quarter mile down the drag strip. And the VW bug example, a car that is slower than it's GT3 spoiler suggests, so NOT a sleeper.\nThat's a summary on sleeper cars for you,\nPlease leave your feedback and tell everyone what you think regarding this highly debatable subject in the race car world. Don't forget to share this video with your car buddies and see what they think.  favorite, thumbs up and....\nThanks for watching.", "title": "Is my car a SLEEPER?

When he is murdered, all evidence points to Kham (Tony Jaa), who was seen with the victim before he died. Kham is forced to run as the police launch a pursuit. Meanwhile, the twin nieces of Boss Suchart (Jija Yanin Wismitanan and Teerada Kittisiriprasert) are out for revenge. But luck is on Kham's side when he runs into Sergeant Mark (Mum Jokmok), an agent sent to Thailand on a secret mission. In another twist, Kham is drawn into an underground fighting ring run by LC (RZA), a crime lord who's obsessed with collecting top-class martial artists. LC's fighters are branded by numbers, such as the lethal, beautiful Twenty (Ratha Pho-ngam) and the diabolical No. 2 (Marrese Crump).

Go me!  Inspired by both the song and by the fact that Jackson and Lisa would be an undeniably hot couple if it weren't for the whole trying to kill each other part.\n\nWarning you now, bit lengthy description.\n\n    The video begins over five years after the events in \"Red Eye\", and things have changed drastically. Released from custody after turning in his employers, Jackson Rippner now works for the government, using his background to find national terrorists. Lisa, on the other hand, has gone through a string of promotions and is shown to be a cheerful, well-adjusted individual, a far cry from the broken woman Jackson had previously known.\n\n    The two unexpectedly meet (once again) in an airport, and are understandably shocked. Jackson dares Lisa to try and turn him in, but they both know it wouldn't do her any good. Jackson is surprised at his Leese's behavior; she appears unfazed by his company, and doesn't seem to mind holding conversation with him. He realizes that he no longer has any control over her, not in her memories or her thoughts. He can't help but feel a little proud.\n\n    The pride is mixed with older feelings, though - Jackson struggles with the attraction that he once felt for Lisa in another airport terminal. He had always toyed with the idea that he would have pursued her had she not been part of the job. While he contemplates these thoughts, he realizes Lisa has fallen asleep on his shoulder, and he is blindsided by the trust she's displaying. Taking advantage of her nap and the fact that both of their planes has been delayed, he begins talking of all the things that have happened in his life in the past five years, including the fact that \"I could have almost fallen in love you.\"\n    When Lisa wakes, the both of them begin thinking of their first meeting. Lisa struggles to connect the violent, bloody thirsty Jackson she thought was real and the charming, amiable Jackson who has resurfaced; she can't figure out which one of them is the true him. Jackson wonders at the more confident Lisa who puzzles him even more. Neither of them understand who the other person is. As they contemplate this, it is announced that Lisa's plane is about to board, and she bids Jackson goodbye, knowing just how unlikely it is they'll ever see each other again. They'll have to live with the mystery.", "title": "-*Recessional*-Jackson/Lisa", "publishedDate": "2009-06-16T05:41:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4OODQ3DFoMM", "description": "David Ruddle owner of thebestof Eastbourne http://bst.bz/GFq2rR was pleased to introduce Steve Hewlett to perform at our local event the Eastbourne Tweetup.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Warner\nScreenwriter: John Huston, B. Traven\nFilm Description: John Huston's 1948 treasure-hunt classic begins as drifter Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), down and out in Tampico, Mexico, impulsively spends his last bit of dough on a lottery ticket. Later on, Dobbs and fellow indigent Curtin (Tim Holt) seek shelter in a cheap flophouse and meet Howard (Walter Huston), a toothless, garrulous old coot who regales them with stories about prospecting for gold. Forcibly collecting their pay from their shifty boss, Dobbs and Curtin combine this money with Dobbs's unexpected windfall from a lottery ticket and, together with Howard, buy the tools for a prospecting expedition. Dobbs has pledged that anything they dig up will be split three ways, but Howard, who's heard that song before, doesn't quite swallow this. As the gold is mined and measured, Dobbs grows increasingly paranoid and distrustful, and the men gradually turn against each other on the way toward a bitterly ironic conclusion. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superior morality play and one of the best movie treatments of the corrosiveness of greed. Huston keeps a typically light and entertaining touch despite the strong theme, for which he won Oscars for both Director and Screenplay, as well as a supporting award for his father Walter, making Walter, John, and Anjelica Huston the only three generations of one family all to win Oscars.\n\n\"power videos\",\"alfonso bedoya\",\"empowerment videos\",\"bruce bennett\",\"cowboy hat videos\",westerns,\"gold hat\",\"action adventure\",dobbs,cody,\"jos torvay\",\"donkey videos\",\"mountain videos\",\"tim holt\",\"survival videos\",\"gun videos\",\"classic country western\",\"henry blanke\",\"hat videos\",\"deception videos\",pablo,\"fear videos\",\"walter huston\",\"margarito luna\",classics,\"classic action adventure\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++50884,/m/03n6r,/m/05nf8b,/m/06lmgv,/m/012dtw,/m/0hpnks8,/m/0gc62g0", "title": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (6/10) Movie CLIP - No Stinking Badges (1948) HD", "publishedDate": "2014-02-05T20:14:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4OcrB4q_U-0", "description": "DISCLAIMER: THIS A NON-PROFIT FAN-BASED PRODUCTION.

Kitman Ho, Arnold Kopelson\nScreenwriter: Oliver Stone\nFilm Description: Oliver Stone's breakthrough as a director, Platoon is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty in Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a college student who quits school to volunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam, where he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers under two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul, and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both personal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks \"in country,\" Taylor begins to see the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his views of the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves into a round of murder and rape. Unlike Hollywood's first wave of Vietnam movies (including The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Coming Home), Platoon is a grunt's-eye view of the war, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the battles and suffered the wounds. In this sense, it resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers, as it mixes familiar elements of onscreen battle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion, C-rations, marijuana, and counting the days before you go home. This mix of traditional war movie elements with a contemporary sensibility won Platoon four Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, and a reputation as one of the definitive modern war films.\n\nplatoon,\"platoon clip\",\"platoon full movie\",\"platoon soundtrack\",\"sgt elias\",drama,\"willem dafoe\",blockbusters,\"deception videos\",\"20th century period pieces\",\"a kitman ho\",\"rivalry videos\",\"machine gun videos\",\"war videos\",\"vietnam videos\",\"tom berenger\",\"oliver stone\",\"sgt barnes\",\"jungle videos\",\"charlie sheen\",\"period pieces\",\"john daly\",\"military war dramas\",\"betrayal videos\",chris,\"military war action\",\"derek gibson\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++38327,/m/021npv", "title": "Platoon (6/10) Movie CLIP - Barnes Frags Elias (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T02:13:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4P2FxRe6SlY", "description": "En nuestro blog Barman in Red en http://www.barmaninred.blogspot.com/ encontraras todo lo relacionado con la cocteleria y el mundo de las bebidas.\n\ncomo preparar un Daiquiri", "title": "como prepara un coctel DAIQUIRI PASI\u00d3N", "publishedDate": "2012-08-31T11:00:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4P2RUYHByzg", "description": "This is Elcon concrete washing  down a driveway that was poured the day before exposing the pebble mix underneath .

However it is not used as a royal residence, as the king and his family live in the Royal Castle of Laeken on the outskirts of Brussels. The website of the Belgian Monarchy describes the function of the palace as follows: \"The Palace is where His Majesty the King exercises his prerogatives as Head of State, grants audiences and deals with affairs of state. Apart from the offices of the King and the Queen, the Royal Palace houses the services of the Grand Marshal of the Court, the King's Head of Cabinet, the Head of the King's Military Household and the Intendant of the King's Civil List. The Palace also includes the State Rooms where large receptions are held, as well as the apartments provided for foreign Heads of State during official visits.\"\nThe palace is situated in front of Brussels Park. A long square called the Paleizenplein/Place des Palais separates the palace from the park. The middle axis of the park marks both the middle peristyle of the palace and the middle of the facing building on the other side of the park, which is the Palace of the Nation (the Belgian Federal Parliament building). The two facing buildings are said to symbolize Belgium's system of government: a constitutional monarchy.\nMonarchy in Belgium is constitutional and popular in nature.

London Zoo keepers don't spare the animals' blushes as they conduct their annual weigh-in.\n\nHow tall or short, fat or thin? London Zoo keepers had their work cut out on Thursday conducting the annual weight and height measurements of all their animals.\n\nIt's a monumental task to weigh and measure more than 750 different species, including lions, tigers, penguins and snakes.\n\nFirst up were the cheeky golden lion headed tamarins, who needed no encouragement to jump all over the specially adapted scales.\n\nCuddly Tammy the tamandua, or tree ant eater, lumbered along to see what all the fuss was about and happily spent a long time on the scales in front of photographers. \n\nShe weighed in at around 19 pounds (8.5 kilos).\n\n[Nicky Jargo, Senior Keeper, London Zoo]:\n\"She's probably a little bit heavy this morning following all that banana that she had as a treat on the scales, but she's a good healthy weight at the moment.\"\n\nThe heavyweight of the tortoise world, the giant Galapagos tortoise, \"Dirk\" weighed in as a respectable 371 pounds (168.5 kilos).\n\nA carrot was all that was needed to get Dirk onto the scales, but some creatures are far more difficult to deal with. \n\n[Nicky Jargo, Senior Keeper, London Zoo]:\n\"Some of the harder ones are some of the flighty animals, so for example some of the smaller birds who don't like to sit still for too long.\"\n\nThe easiest animals are ones who are motivated to anything with the promise of a food treat, but that does mean they are the most likely to be a little red-faced at the rising numbers on the scales during the weigh-in.\n\nThe insects are measured rather than weighed.\n\nJacqueline the tarantula was 4 inches (10 centimeters).\n\nThe stick insect came in at around 12 inches (30 centimeters) - the length of the keeper's ruler.\n\nOnce keepers managed to straighten out Stripey the milk snake, they discovered he was 39 inches (1 meter) long.\n\nThe meticulous recording of heights and weights helps the zoo monitor the animals' health and general well-being.\n\n[Nicky Jargo, Senior Keeper, London Zoo]:\n\"Obviously the animals can't tell us if they are poorly, so we do have to keep a very good visual eye on them and weight change, sudden weight change, is a really good indication of any health problems there might be. And also monitoring any possible pregnancies as well.\"\n\nThe information is shared with other zoos to help better understand each species. \n\nThe logs of vital statistics help with field conservation projects where wild animals are monitored to better understand behavior, health and even an animal's age.", "title": "London Zoo Animals Weigh in and Measure up", "publishedDate": "2011-08-26T10:33:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PDBpeIKS1E", "description": "http://www.HistoryBookMix.com\n\nThis is the summary of Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution: April-June 1918 by Nestor Makhno.", "title": "History Book Review: Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution: April-June 1918 by Nestor Makhno", "publishedDate": "2012-10-23T07:46:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PDCap9ASkY", "description": "\"Dreadnought Sideroad\",une des magnifiques chansons de Jonathan Keevil tir\u00e9e du film Bellflower (2011) d'Evan Glodell.\nFilm \u00e0 voir et \u00e0 revoir...", "title": "Dreadnought Sideroad - Jonathan Keevil - Bellflower Soundtrack - HD (1080p)", "publishedDate": "2012-10-22T15:01:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PE8O4XtI1o", "description": "english project", "title": "Delirium- theme", "publishedDate": "2011-03-30T23:16:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PE8otwthqM", "description": "http://scrolls.larpcraft.com/index.php?threads/larp-medieval-hooded-cloak-by-epic-armoury-review.6745/ This simple Cloak will go with any period outfit.

Henryka Warsa -- Przyjd\u017a (Come!) Tango z rewii \"T\u0119cza nad Warszaw\u0105\" (from Morskie Oko revue \"Rainbow Over Warsaw\") Muz. Jerzy Petersburski, Tekst Andrzej W\u0142ast, Syrena-Electro 1931\n\nNOTE: Adam ASTON ( Adolf Loewinsohn, b. 1902 in Warsaw, Poland -- d. 1993, London GB) Polish singer, one of top names among song interpreters in inter-war Poland. He was born in family of a wealthy merchant so he could afford lessons at a private school of Wac\u0142aw Brzezi\u0144ski, who was one of most famous Polish tenors of the begining of the 20th century. Aston's first step towards fame was his participation in a male revellers group Ch\u00f3r Warsa, which was completed in 1931 by pianist, composer and bandleader Henryk Wars (Tadeusz Faliszewski, Tadeusz Sas-Jaworski and Adam Aston) http://youtu.be/uuFHlZ2VRAE .  His strong, juicy, melancholic baritone was quickly noticed by directors of the revue theatres of Warsaw  (\"Morskie Oko\", \"Banda\", \"Hollywood\") where he also started solo performances. His immediate success made him unable to continue singing in Ch\u00f3r Warsa, moreover -- his voice appeared to be genuinely phonogenic and Aston's recorded versions of most beautiful Polish tangoes: \u201eTamara\" http://youtu.be/BxKp15eilGM ,  \"Rebeka\" http://youtu.be/uYrRxJzNHJ8   , \"Tango Brazylijskie\" (Brasilian Tango) http://youtu.be/zN85Lcietgs  , \"To tango jest dla ciebie\" (This Tango Is For You) http://youtu.be/yIHg4JUmUcY or \"Miasteczko Be\u0142z\" (Stetl Belz) http://youtu.be/t27JYpd8POQ  quickly guaranteed him a steady position as one of  three most popular and most praised Polish tango interpreters (ex aexuo with Mieczys\u0142aw Fogg and Tadeusz Faliszewski).  Among all the tangoes as well as passionate English waltzes (to mention only his sophisticated interpretation of valse-hesitation \"Madame Loulou\", http://youtu.be/YOuCXNkwrQA  \"Bajki\" http://youtu.be/LnPDsUxLubU or \"Opium\" http://youtu.be/T4XrgDSwb   ) he would not either avoid rhumbas or fox-trotts, although Stefania Beylin, influential Warsaw columnist who led weekend reviews of phonographic novelties, emphasised his outstanding talent rather for the torch singing than fashionable jazzy repertoire. In spite of that, his bravura-versions of many hot film \"schlagers\" (hits) of that time will also remain in Polish phono-museion as Aston's little masterpieces e.g. Yddish-foxtrott \"Nikodem\" http://youtu.be/z2VSR_4xFp0 or  Henryk Wars' compositions to a comedy movie \"Zapomniana melodia\" (A Forgotten Tune) http://youtu.be/A_dkDycgqUs . In years 1930-39 Aston recorded ca 960 sides, predominantly for Syrena Records although he also recorded for Odeon, Lonora-Electro, parlophon and Columbia (under his name or as \"Adam Wi\u0144ski\" or \"Jerzy Kierski\"). As Ben-Lewi he also made several sides for Syrena Hebrew-series http://youtu.be/f2t8dnlDv-s  http://youtu.be/tqa6wyUam3Q http://youtu.be/QkSt7dZttXw  \n   German attack on Poland on 1st September 1939, found him in Lwow where he was evacuated together with the staff of Polish Broadcast in Warsaw. Two weeks later, when Russians attacked Poland from the East, he stayed in Lwow where Henryk Wars arranged a Tea-Jazz -- the orchestral dance-and-singing group of the homeless artists and singers who fled from under the German bombs, from Warsaw. For a couple of years, Tea Jazz was tolerated by Soviet authorities and permission for the group was granted to make tournees throughout the Soviet Union. That relatively decent situation dramatically changed on 22nd June 1941, when the Soviet-German war broke and soon after that, the mass grave of 10, 000 of the Polish officers executed without any legal reason by Stalin's Secret Police in the woods of Katyn, was revealed.  Many artists from Tea Kjazz -- in that number, excellent film actor and singer Eugeniusz Bodo -- were arrested (Bodo later died of hunger in Stalinist work camp of Kot\u0142as, near Archangelsk). Adam Aston was sent to Kirgistan, where he, almost starved to death, was found by his prewar colleague, Ryszard Frank who was leading a dance band for the Soviet army. After Molotov-Sikorski Pact of alliance, when the tough Soviet attitude to Poles slightly weakened, Aston  managed to leave Kirgistan and join the Polish Army in emmigration, which was being formed by General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders first in Russia and later in Persia, in 1941. There, as Polish army officer, he continued performing in the army theatre. In that time, in Italy he made his perhaps most beautiful recording ever made: an unofficial anthem of Polish Emigree Army, the patriotic march \"Czerwone Maki na Monte Cassino\" (Red Poppies Of Monte Cassino) http://youtu.be/YQRz1nSt9Cw\nAfter the end of war, Aston refused to return to a communist-occupied Poland and he stayed on emigration first in Johannesburg and then, in London.", "title": "Adam Aston - Tango \"Przyjd\u017a\" (Come!), 1931", "publishedDate": "2012-03-09T20:33:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PWUprr1XsU", "description": "Repost: From one of the Kellogg's original NBC television show EP's is the original soundtrack song!

Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term \"shark\" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago. Since then, sharks have diversified into over 470 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive in both seawater and freshwater. They breathe through five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth. Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators\u2014organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. In 2006 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) megalodon undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3. Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, cow frilled dogfish dog sawsharks saw angel bullhead carpet ground mackarel ray rays tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack mako makos and kill people.

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters. To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450--420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments. Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee", "title": "Megalodon Shark Gets Dangerously Close To Boat!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T08:10:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PXxe-dBQKk", "description": "Seth Berger has his share of problems.

The Cro repressor, for example, is a homodimer formed of two identical subunits. The subunits join in a head-to-head fashion as two small beta\nsheets\u2014one from each subunit\u2014zipper up and form a larger beta sheet.  The enzyme neuraminidase is composed of four identical subunits arranged in a square. Each pair of two subunits is held together in head-to-tail fashion, by repeated use of the same binding interaction. This becomes clear when the polypeptide chains are colored in a rainbow pattern, so that the same regions of each subunit have the same colors. All subunits adhere to each other through contacts between the orange and light-blue regions.  Hemoglobin is a tetrameric protein that transports oxygen. It is composed of two a subunits and two closely related beta subunits. Oxygen binds to heme groups in the protein, which are shown in red. Each subunit can sense whether neighboring subunits contain bound oxygen. The protein subunits therefore communicate with one another through the interfaces that hold them together.  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a tetramer of four identical subunits.  Each p53 subunit contains a simple tetramerization domain composed of a single beta strand connected to an alpha helix. The tetrameric form of p53 assembles as a dimer of dimers. Two copies of p53 interact via beta strands, forming a two-stranded beta sheet. Two such dimers interact via their alpha helices to form the tetrameric assembly.\"\n\nEssential Cell Biology, Second Edition\nby Alberts, Bray, Hopkin, Johnson, Lewis, Raff, Roberts, Walter\ncopyright 2004 by Garland Science Publishing", "title": "Oligomeric Proteins", "publishedDate": "2009-04-10T05:45:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PdMRMlfDg0", "description": "\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/zdorovnar \u0421\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0437\u044f \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f; \u0441\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0446\u0443\u0431\u0443\u0441\u0438 -- \u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0430\u0442\u044e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439; \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u0440. \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u043c\u0435\u0447\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0437\u044f \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043f\u044c\u044e \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438--\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0438. \nSpecific actions ninja on the penetration into the closed and protected areas, the removal time, the use of metsubusi - blinding powder and smoky miniature grenades, evasiveness and camouflage with the surrounding terrain and features of the buildings, overcoming obstacles, etc. Working with a ninja sword and battle-chain Manrique gusari .", "title": "\u041d\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0437\u044f - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 38", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T10:25:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PdVLfOq4gc", "description": "F\u00fcr Smartphones und Tablets, hier die neuen Rezepte von Esslust: http://goo.gl/yUjP45\nEine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Spargel- und Gem\u00fcsesch\u00e4lern gibt es z.

It was given just over a month after he took over as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the head of an all-party Coalition government.\n\nIt was the third of three speeches which he gave during (roughly) the period of the Battle of France.\n\n\nThe speech was delivered to the Commons at 3:49 pm[6], and lasted 36 minutes. Churchill - as was his habit - made revisions to his 23 page typescript right up to and during the speech. The final passage of his typescript was laid out in blank verse format, which Churchill scholars consider reflective of the influence of Old Testament psalms on his oratory style\n\nWhat General Weygand has called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.\n\nBut if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.", "title": "Into the Storm of War -  Their Finest Hour - Churchill Battle of Britain speech", "publishedDate": "2010-09-14T12:56:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Pg4fXuqeHg", "description": "Don't buy gold-plated USB connectors strictly because they're gold-plated.

The goat is a member of the family Bovidae and is closely related to the sheep as both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over three hundred distinct breeds of goat.\n \nGoats are one of the oldest domesticated species. Goats have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In the twentieth century they also gained in popularity as pets.\n \nFemale goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males as bucks or billies; their offspring are kids. Castrated males are wethers. Goat meat from younger animals is called kid or cabrito, and from older animals is simply known as goat or sometimes called chevon, or in some areas mutton (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).\n\nMost goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed. All goats have horns unless they are \"polled\" meaning they have one parent with a dominant polled gene.There have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.\n \nGoats are ruminants. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.\n \nGoats have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, an adaptation which increases peripheral depth perception. Because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera.\n \nBoth male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.\n \nSome breeds of sheep and goats look similar, but they can usually be told apart because goat tails are short and usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger -- though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) are short, and longer ones are often docked.", "title": "Goat Steals Red Solo Cup", "publishedDate": "2012-03-04T20:52:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4PhhAXPiYiM", "description": "MARY\u2019S LAND.

Legendary producer Rodney Jerkins AKA Dark Child has summoned Ariana Grande and Jessie J to cover Brandy and Monica\u2019s 90s Grammy award winning hit \u201cThe Boy is Mine.\u201d In an interview with HitsDailyDouble, Jerkins explained the motive behind the Jessie/Ari cover saying QUOTE -  \u201cNext year is my 20-year anniversary [in the music industry] and I\u2019m doing a very special project [with] some originals as well as reimagined hits.\u201d \nAnd the sure to be brilliant covers don\u2019t stop with Jessie and Ariana.

But with a line up with voices like Ariana Grande, Jessie J, and Sam Smith\u2019s I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to worry.  \nSo what are your initial thoughts on the upcoming covers?

Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion, Leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome \"immortals\" draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy.\n\n300,\"300 clip\",\"300 violin orchestra\",\"300 spartans\",\"gerard butler\",\"lena headey\",\"dominic west\",\"peter mensah\",\"zack snyder\",\"sword videos\",\"action adventure\",adventure,\"comic books and superheroes\",drama,\"dramas based on real life\",\"dramas based on the book\",epics,\"military war dramas\",\"military action adventure\",\"thomas tull\",\"gianni nunnari\",\"mark canton\",\"jeffrey silver\",\"william fay\",\"ben waisbren\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++334031,/m/038rzr,/m/06mnbn,/m/0686zv,/m/0gyq77", "title": "This is Sparta! - 300 (1/5) Movie CLIP (2006) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T02:58:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Ps620AG3nI", "description": "90 Day Installment Loans are available 24/7 at http://www.nationalcashcredit.com/Services_Installment.aspx\n\nShow us some love on our Google+ page by giving us a +1 https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113043852796067813516/\n\nPayday loans, 24 hour loans, cash advances, and bad credit no fax loans are great\u2014however there is a downside.

Good brakes from Brembo even with the ABS off and WP suspension soaks up the bumps really well. The handling is quick and precise for a little bike. Feels like riding a 125 again although with a bigger engine in the frame. Fuel range is fantastic, very economical for a big single. Looks like a stunt bike as well.\n\nBad Points:\nI could feel vibrations through the bars but overtime I think the rider would get use to it. The riding position is very compact and was too cramped for me and I'm not that tall neither (5'10). ABS, just don't like it, thank god it was disabled. Even though it looks like a stunt bike, it struggled to wheelie. On a flat straight road, I just couldn't clutch it up in 3rd, gearing was way too tall for it, maybe -1 on the front sprocket and 2-3 on the back it would be a little hooligan machine.\n\nIn summary its a fun bike to ride, nimble in the twisties and keeps up with the big bikes.

Although we enjoyed the process and inexpensiveness of home recording, we always knew that there was something sonically or emotionally missing from the finished product.\n\nIn 2010, with more knowledge and confidence about the recording process, we set out to record & produce our first full-length album. We spent more than a year recording, mixing, re-recording and re-mixing a dozen songs. No matter what we tried, we couldn't capture where we were going musically or what we were trying to convey emotionally. After much internal stress and debate, we knew in our hearts that we couldn't release those recordings.  With that, we scrapped over a year's worth of hard work.\n\nAs time passed and the battle scars of home recording started to heal, we began saving our pennies to try again.... but this time, in a real studio with the help of a producer.\n\nAt the start of 2012, we started working with producer Derek Chafin at the Barn Studio in Newtown Square, PA. Within our first week of working with Derek, the musical chemistry between the 5 of us was apparent. We knew that we had turned a musical corner and that we'd never be the same band again. After two months of working out song arrangements & ideas in pre-production, we hit the record button.\n\nOver the past four months of tracking we've been blown away by how focused, edgy and huge Derek has made our songs sound. We're beyond excited about the musical direction our songs have gone in. They're more powerful and cohesive together, while still being emotionally charged and pop-friendly. The album is just over halfway finished, but we've hit a financial wall... we're out of the necessary funding to keep going.\n\nOur decision to go into a real studio happened when we realized that to do something we truly believed in, we needed to ask for help from others. We are once again standing at those crossroads.\n\nWith the advent of Kickstarter and the assistance from our Parsnip family, we now have the opportunity to create an album that was impossible for us before...  and one that we've never been so excited to make/release to the masses.\n\nWith your help, we will be able to finish the recording, mixing, mastering, duplication, distribution, and promotional costs associated with making the album. *Our goal is to raise $4,000 in 30 days*, which will immensely help us to supplement a much larger cost.\n\nHere is the \"kick\" with Kickstarter: *If we are unable to raise enough to reach our $4,000 goal in the alotted time frame, we get none of it! Zip! Zilch! Nada! Even if we raise $3999.99!*\n\nNow, if we not only reach our goal, but exceed it, we have the opportunity to put more resources into production to make the album even better. The band does not pocket even a penny of the contributions for personal use and all money raised goes exclusively to the making of this album.\n\nContributing is a very simple process and comes with rewards that we give back to you for your kind generosity. After you have reviewed your desired rewards package, simply click on the green button that says \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" and follow the instructions.\n\nWe truly cannot thank you enough for your support over the years and for supporting / spreading the word about our Kickstarter campaign.\n\nSincerely,\n\n-The Parsnip Revolt\n\nGeremiah, Jake, Brian & Tom\n\n\n\n*Video by Lucy Dog Productions \ncontact: mte077@gmail.com", "title": "The Parsnip Revolt's Kickstarter campaign.", "publishedDate": "2012-07-11T13:53:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Q2BnKBgpwQ", "description": "Violetta - Austin Covey gives guitar lessons.\n\n\nMyspace.com/Violettarocks\n\nTwitter @ Violettarocks\n\nviolettaband@gmail.com\n\n-Violetta", "title": "Violetta - Update #6 ( Austin Covey Guitar Lessons)", "publishedDate": "2010-02-04T04:53:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4Q2oqG6S4Mk", "description": "Produced in conjunction with the exhibition German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse.

The image may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets and others.\nThe CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep, heavy, and relatively fragile. Display technologies without these disadvantages, such as flat plasma displays, liquid crystal displays, DLP, OLED have replaced CRTs in many applications and are becoming increasingly common as costs decline. A cathode ray tube is a vacuum tube which consists of one or more electron guns, possibly internal electrostatic deflection plates, and a phosphor target. In television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Cathode Ray Tube", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T09:04:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "4QB0riFTxUc", "description": "The Snoogle is much more than a basic maternity pillow.

From the first time I walked into Dr. White\u2019s office until the final checkup, my experience and the results were amazing. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes!   I never had pain or bleeding afterwards.  His staff always treated me kindly and I was impressed with their service and professionalism.  The office is spacious and squeaky clean.  I would highly recommend Dr. White for a gum grafting procedure. \n\n        White & Blansett Periodontics\n        201 North 34th Street\n        Rogers AR\n        72756\n\nCall us today at: (479) 631-6074\n\nDr. White and Dr. Blansett, both graduates of the Periodontics Residency at Baylor College of Dentistry, share a common treatment philosophy.  They believe all patients deserve exceptional results delivered with comfort and compassion.  Our focus is providing the most minimally invasive periodontal and implant services available.  Our practice utilizes the latest technology and techniques to provide minimally invasive periodontal care and placement of dental implants including:\n\n- The use of erbium lasers (Waterlase iPlus\u00ae) that can clean contaminated root and implant surfaces efficiently and safely, and often without conventional incisions or suturing.  \n\n- Equipping our office with a powerful microscopic video camera, called a videoscope.  This technology allows us to see the surgical field up to 60X magnification and allows us to treat deeper periodontal pockets using tiny incisions.  \n\n- The use a variety of growth factors to speed wound healing and promote hard and soft tissue regeneration.  \n\n- Placement of brand name dental implants (Nobel Active\u00ae) with maximum safety utilizing computer guided surgery.  This technology allows implants to be placed with three dimensional guidance to avoid roots of adjacent teeth, large nerves and blood vessels, and structures like the floor of the nose and sinus cavities.  \n\n- Dr. White and Dr. Blansett were both trained by Dr. Pat Allen, a pioneer in minimally invasive periodontal plastic surgery procedures.  Grafts are often placed to beautifully cover exposed roots without ANY visible surface incisions, often without a separate donor site on the palate.  \n\nDr. White and Dr. Blansett collaborate on most cases and we believe our patients benefit from the synergy of Dr. White\u2019s experience and Dr. Blansett\u2019s recent training.  Please contact our office if you are considering undergoing treatment for gum disease or you need dental implants.

I teach photography at the Visual School of Photography in New York.  We're going to talk about shooting portraits at night.\n\nThe way I usually do this is to use a flash and whatever the ambient light is, whatever is there when you show up.  The street lights, whatever they happen to be.  And I use a technique called driving the shutter or slow sync.  \n\nAnd the idea is for your flash to be your main light, your brightest light, and that's what exposes your subject, and then the ambient light, whatever happens to be there when you show up, that's going to be your fill light.  \n\nAnd you're going to drag the shutter.  You're going to use a long shutter speed so that those background lights have a chance to fill in your background and prevent it from being black which is what usually happens when you use a flash.\n\nSo what you do.  You set whatever F-stop you want to shoot at, 4 or 5.6, something that's appropriate to a portrait, and you set up your flash to deliver a correct exposure for that F-stop.  Different cameras are going to do that different ways.  But if you're using the pop-up flash on your camera, pretty much all you have to do is set your F-stop.  \n\nUse the camera in manual mode so you can control your F-stop and your shutter speed and set them yourself.\n\nAnd while you're looking through the view finder, you're going to start dropping your shutter speed.  You're going to start adjusting your shutter speed while you're watching the light speed indicator in your view finder.  And you're going to drop that shutter speed until it gets down to about -1.  -1 is what you want it to be.  You don't want your ambient light to be giving you the same amount of light as your flash where you're going to get an overexposure.  \n\nIf you're doing it at night, you're using street lights or something, you're probably going to wind up at a pretty long shutter speed.  It could be 1/15, 1/8, or 1/4 or even a full second long.\n\nAnd normally a shutter speed like that isn't one what you'd be able to hand-hold your camera at.  Just the motion of your hands and your heartbeat and your breathing would be enough to create a lot of blur.  \n\nBut fortunately the flash is going to solve part of that problem for you.  The flash duration is so fast, and it winks on and off so quickly, that it's going to freeze your subject and if there's any motion blur, most of that motion blur is going to be in the background of that picture which is still better than a black background.  \n\nYou're going to shoot a couple of frames and check the back of your camera and make sure that you've got a good balance and that your subject looks right and that your background is filling in nicely.  And then once you do that, just keep shooting and shooting and shooting.  Give your flash enough time to recycle between frames.\n\nAnd that is a very, very simple way to shoot portraits at night.", "title": "How to Shoot a Portrait at Night | Portrait Photography", "publishedDate": "2013-12-15T04:14:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4QOV9gfR_1s", "description": "SUPPORT THE HODGETWINS BY SHOPPING AT: \nhttp://officialhodgetwins.com/\n\nFOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM\nhttp://instagram.com/officialhodgetwins\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK\nhttp://www.facebook.com/thehodgetwins\n\nLINKS TO OUR OTHER YOUTUBE CHANNELS\n\n\u201cBODYBUILDING\u201d AND \u201cFITNESS\u201d CHANNEL\nhttp://www.youtube.com/twinmuscleworkout\n\n\u201cCurrent Events\u201d Youtube Channel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/hodgetwins\n\nASKHODGETWINS \u201cRELATIONSHIP ADVICE\u201d\nhttp://www.youtube.com/askhodgetwins\n\n\u201cINTERMITTENT FASTING\u201d FITNESS CHANNEL\nhttp://www.youtube.com/fastingtwins\n\n\nHodgetwins Bio:\nKeith and Kevin Hodge the \u201cHodgetwins\u201d are famously known for their comedic commentary on the following Youtube channels \u201cHodgetwins\u201d, \u201cTwin Muscle Workout\u201d \u201cAskHodgetwins\u201dand \u201cfastingtwins\u201d They have earned a respectable 2 million loyal subscribers and grossed over 400 million views over these channels.\n\n\u201cTags\u201d and \u201cKeywords\u201d relevant to this \u201cYouTube channel\u201d\n\"bodybuilding\" \"bodybuilders\" \"identical twin bodybuilders\" \"identical twins bodybuilding\" \"twin bodybuilders\" \"twin bodybuilding\" \"build muscle\" \"how to build muscle\" \"gains\" \"how to get stronger\" \"strongman\" \"strength\" \"hodgetwins\" \"fastingtwins\" \"fasting twins\" \"diet\" \"diet advice\" \"nutrition\" nutrition advice\" \"fitness\" \"fitness advice\" \"exercise\" exercising\" \"bodybuilding motivation\" \"motivation to get into shape\" \"motivational fitness videos\" \"twins discussing fitness\" \"twins discussing bodybuilding topics\" \"motivation to exercise\" \"motivation to lose weight\" \"strength training\" \"bodybuilding exercises\" \"bodybuilding movements\" \"compound exercises\" \"the best exercises to build muscle\" \"bodybuilding challenges\" \"challenges to get fit\" \"challenges to exercising\" \"advice\" \"certified fitness trainers\" \u201csix pack abs\u201d \u201cfasted training\u201d \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d \u201cIF\u201d \u201chow to get a six pack\u201d \u201chow to make gains\u201d \u201cthe hodge twins\u201d \u201cTmw\u201d \u201csupplements\u201d \u201cbodybuilding supplements\u201d \u201cnutritional supplements\u201d \u201chow to supplement your diet\u201d \nSimilar YouTube channels to \u201ctwinmuscleworkout\u201d and our \u201cfastingtwins\u201d channel \"strengthcamp\" \"physiquesofgreatness\" \u201cphysiques of greatness\u201d \u201csixpackshortcuts\u201d \u201csix pack shortcuts\u201d \u201cstrength camp\u201d \"H@%#eT!*&SH@%#eT!*&S\"", "title": "Pyramid Sets Vs.

The creation of this unique model is the synthesis resulting from the combined perspectives of the two brands.\nEugenio Franzetti, Public Relations Manager of Peugeot Italia, says: \"Peugeot and Castagna have so many values in common that it was inevitable their paths would cross, sooner or later. First of all, tradition: Castagna was established in 1849, Peugeot has over 200 years of history... it is no surprise that we met at a vintage car\nAs a matter of fact, both Brands have a veritable cult of tradition. Peugeot preserves its heritage at the Sochaux Museum (France) and can boast an organization - \"L'Aventure Peugeot\" -- which unites all the Lion's Classic Car Clubs existing globally, including Peugeot Italy's Club Storico.\n\"The past is a continuous source of inspiration for the future;\" adds Eugenio Franzetti \"If we look at the history of our models, it clearly emerges that Peugeot has always pursued innovation and development within its model range, either by manufacturing unique models or by drawing upon independent body stylists, for its sports models like the Dar'l Mats or for series production cars, where the collaboration with the car designer Pininfarina is exemplary. Therefore, it was perhaps an obvious decision to sublimate the intrinsic values of the Peugeot models -- quality finish, attention to detail, real driving enjoyment -- in the production of a unique model that could incorporate the typical values of the Castagna products: development of new materials and their unprecedented mix and match; the warmth, the refinement and the originality of its creations, the scrupulous quality craftsmanship.\"\nCastagna chose the 508 RXH model, the flagship of the range for Peugeot given its generous equipment and it was its \"Allroad\" design that provoked and inspired the coachbuilder from Milan to express his creativity and enhance the premium quality features of this model.\nCurrently, 508 RXH is the highest technological expression of the Peugeot brand. Its innovative HYbrid4 technology allows to mate a 2.0 litre, 163 bhp front diesel engine with a 37 bhp rear electric motor, capable of delivering a maximum power of 200 bhp that can be best exploited, depending upon the circumstances, by selecting one of the four modes foreseen by the drive mode selection knob positioned on the central tunnel.\nYou can select the Auto mode to privilege riding comfort and sustainable mobility, or the Sport mode to maximise performance and available power. However you can also ride in the ZEV mode relying only on the electric motor or use the 4WD to exploit the two powertrains and continuously power the front and rear wheels.\n\"Together with Castagna, we set out from the distinctive features of the 508 RXH and from its HYbrid4 technology to imagine a journey. The journey of a successful man who lives in an urban context but who is also keen to escape for short getaways in the countryside or for short mountain skiing holidays, and travels through these different landscapes in the environmentally - friendly way which a hybrid car allows\" concludes Eugenio Franzetti.\nIt is now the turn of Gioacchino Acampora, Castagna Coachbuilder's chief designer, to reveal his sources of inspiration for this car: \"It is no secret: over the last few years -- and I even wrote it \"back in the day\" - I have stated my admiration for French design and the manner in which the French make products. However, since when I had the opportunity to drive some of the Lion's cars, my actual feelings have surpassed my expectations. Recent prototypes developed by Peugeot like the Onyx concept car, are astonishing due to the use of natural and warm materials, providing a marked contrast to the \"logical\" aspect of the geometrical lines.\nThe underlying idea is simply to allow the spirit of the car to emerge through the use of a single colour. I have often experienced that magical sensation of noiseless drive that this car provides. Sometimes, one would purposely choose a given route just to get lost in the sound of silence: so strong was the desire for \"mimesis\" at a certain point. We drew inspiration from all this to develop a livery that blended the interior to the exterior of the car in a single seamless chromatic tone and this was possible thanks to Lechler and Alcantara.\nhttp://www.carwp.com.br/2014/02/castagna-peugeot-508-rxh-hybrid4-2014.html\nFind us on https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carwp/505636076134244\nDOWNLOAD IMAGES: http://CARWP.com.br\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects", "title": "DESIGN Castagna Peugeot 508 RXH Hybrid4 2014 aro 19 2.0 200 cv", "publishedDate": "2014-02-18T22:18:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4QoRnwWuREg", "description": "Item number: HB442\n\nFollow us on Facebook to check out our Latest GIVEAWAY!

But I need your help. Would you guys like to help me out with this one? Alright. Who wants to be my helper? You wanna do it? \n\nAlright. I'll tell you what I want you to do, alright? I'm gonna fan out the deck, just like that, and I want you to just take any card you'd like. Look. Got it? Good? Alright, excellent.\n\nWhat I'd like you to do is show it to her, show it to the camera. I'm gonna look away. Alright? I'm gonna look away. Tell me when you're good. Alright. Slide it into the deck, face down. Just like so. Good.\n\nNow, we're gonna use some magic to find your card. Alright? But, we're not gonna use traditional magic. Traditional magic let's me find the card. Instead, what I want you to do is I want you to hold your hand above the deck. Snap your fingers, just like that. Because hopefully what'll happen is instead of having to find your card. Your card will just find me. Was that your card? \n\nNot bad, right? You guys wanna know how that's done? Alright. This is a trick called the inverted card trick. It's a great classic. Now, there's something a little bit sneaky going on in this one. Alright? The sneaky thing is that one of the cards on the bottom of the deck is reversed the entire time. But you guys don't know that. That's the secret setup. \n\nSo what I do is I do the thumb fan, and there's a video on how to do the thumb fan if you don't know how to do it, and by doing the thumb fan I just kind of set my thumb a little bit higher than the bottom so that it doesn't fan that card out. So that all you guys see is the normal spread of the deck, right? \n\nThen I have you choose a card. Any card you'd like. Got it? And while they're turned, while I'm turned around and she's showing it to her and to the camera, I actually just literally flipped the deck over in my hand. So now it's actually upside down. The whole deck is upside down, except for that one bottom card. But they don't know that. They think it's still in the same direction. \n\nSo as I turn back, you've seen the card. She's seen the card. The camera's seen the card. I have you slide it back into the deck and I hold the deck nice and loose, right, so it slides in without her seeing any of the cards in the deck. Right? Now I have to flip it back over to reveal the card. \n\nNow, this is actually the really easy part but it's really important. It's the misdirection, right? When I'm talking on, explaining what we're going to do next I'm just gesturing with my hands so you kind of forget the orientation of the deck. And all I do is, just like that.\nFrom here to here as we're talking. And the deck is already turned over.\n\nNow, all I do is I move right through the cards, right? Right until I find hers.

It has also been introduced in many other parts of the world.\n\nIt is an insectivore and the male gets a bright red throat in the breeding season leading to a common incorrect name of \"Bloodsucker\". \n\nTwo small groups of spines, perfectly separated from each other, above each tympanum. Dorsal crest moderately elevated on the neck and anterior part of the trunk, extending on to the root of the tail in large individuals, and gradually disappearing on the middle of the trunk in younger ones. No fold in front of the shoulder, but the scales behind the lower jaw are much smaller than the others; gular sac not developed. From thirty-nine to forty-three series of scales round the middle of the trunk. The hind foot (measured from the heel to the extremity of the fourth toe) is not much longer than the head in the adult, whilst it is considerably longer in the young. The coloration is very variable, sometimes uniform brownish or greyish-olive or yellowish. Generally broad brown bands across the back, interrupted by a yellowish lateral band. Black streaks radiate from the eye, and some of them are continued over the throat, running obliquely backwards, belly frequently with greyish longitudinal stripes, one along the median line being the most distinct; young and half-grown specimens have a dark, black-edged band across the inter-orbital region.\n\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It is available without a prescription; ask your pharmacist for an FDA-approved brand and dosage guidelines.\n\nTip\nIn the event of an attack, emergency officials may advise people over 40 not to take potassium iodide, since they have the lowest chance of developing thyroid cancer or thyroid injury after exposure to radioactive iodine. \n\nStep 2: Go below\nIf an attack is imminent, get indoors and go as far below ground as you can. If that's not possible, seek whatever shelter you can. \n\nStep 3: Seal yourself in\nOnce indoors, close all windows and doors and turn off air conditioners, heaters, and other ventilation systems. \n\nStep 4: Seal up your car\nIf you can't get to a building, stay inside your car. Close the windows and vents, turn off the heat and A/C, and hold a cloth over your mouth and nose to avoid breathing in radioactive dust and smoke. \n\nStep 5: Protect yourself outdoors\nIf you're caught outdoors or very near the blast when it happens, don't look at it or you risk temporary or even permanent blindness. Keep your mouth open so your eardrums don't burst. Don't touch objects thrown by an explosion; they might be radioactive. \n\nStep 6: Stay put\nIf you are more than 10 miles from the epicenter of the blast, remain in the shelter for 48 to 72 hours after the blast. \n\nStep 7: Get out of Dodge!\nIf you are closer than 10 miles to the epicenter after the explosion, get moving! You have 10 to 20 minutes to get at least a mile away from the mushroom cloud, or you risk lethal radiation poisoning. \n\nTip\nBe sure to move downwind or perpendicular to the wind.\n\nStep 8: Cover up\nKeep your mouth, nose, and as much of your skin covered as you move away from the blast area.Once you're at a safe distance, take off your clothes; this alone may get rid of up to 80 percent of radioactive dust. Then take a shower, which will further reduce your exposure. \n\nStep 9: Get decontaminated\nRid your body of radioactive material as soon as possible by reporting to the nearest decontamination center set up in your area. \n\nDid You Know?\nIn the film \"Godzilla 1985,\" a Soviet captain tries to launch a nuclear missile at Tokyo after learning that Godzilla is back.", "title": "How to Survive a Nuclear Terrorist Attack", "publishedDate": "2010-03-22T18:38:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4R6LIdEOs5s", "description": "DVDs & APPAREL - http://www.bustedknuckle.com\n12yr old Mega Truck Driver Weston Anderson aka Teenyman unveils his new Bog Hog Mega Mud Truck and puts it to work at His Dad aka Dennis Anderson's Muddy Motorsports Park.\nFollow us on Facebook  - http://www.facebook.com/bustedknucklefilms\nINSTAGRAM www.instagram.com/bustedknucklefilms", "title": "12YR OLD MEGA TRUCK DRIVER WESTON ANDERSON | BOG HOG", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T22:59:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4R6c-uK-iSg", "description": "", "title": "L'Alg\u00e9rie s'arme, le Maroc s'inqui\u00e8te!! \u0631\u063a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0644\u062d", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T22:21:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4R6gewfNzV8", "description": "Lynda Bellingham's funeral: Tributes paid to a very brave woman\nSubscribe for the latest news from PA: http://bit.ly/RvMVLq\n\nFriends, family and showbiz stars paid tearful tributes to the actress Lynda Bellingham as they said farewell to an \"extraordinary force of nature\". They reminisced with jokes, verse and near-the-knuckle anecdotes as they fondly recalled the 66-year-old, with her \"honking laughter\", who died little over a fortnight ago after she made the decision to end treatment for her cancer. Bellingham - who in recent years had become known as a presenter of ITV's Loose Women - had asked for a lively send-off so her husband Michael Pattemore lined up a string of guests who made her funeral into a variety show-style celebration of her life. They gathered at St Bartholomew's Church in Crewkerne, Somerset, to mourn the actress who was loved by generations for her roles in shows such as Faith In The Future, All Creatures Great And Small and for one of her most enduring roles as the mother in a long-running series of ads for Oxo.\n\nFollow PA on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/pressassoc\n\nThe Press Association:\nhttp://www.pressassociation.com\n\nBreaking news:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/pressassociation \n\nSports news:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/pressassocsport\n\nEntertainment news:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/pressassocents", "title": "Lynda Bellingham's funeral: Tributes paid to a very brave woman", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T19:37:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4R6vr0TtmFU", "description": "This Coconut Chutney Recipe is simple and quick to make dish that is very popularly had along with dosa's and idli's.

The missing Boeing 777-200ER jet had a wingspan of 60.9 metres and a length of 63.7 metres.\nChinese agency SASTIND gave coordinates of 105.63 east longitude, 6.7 north latitude, which would put it in waters northeast of where MH370 took off in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, south of Vietnam and close to where the plane lost contact with air traffic control.\nBut Tom Haueter, former aviation director of the US National Transportation Safety Board, was sceptical that the images were connected with the missing jet.\n\"Any aircraft structure that size would sink. It wouldn't float like this,\" he said. \"I don't believe it's the plane.

Our customer service is unparalleled and is what sets us apart from other Process Servers in North Carolina.\nWe provide quality process serving throughout the continental United States, Canada and overseas. Our service is more than an envelope slapped into the recipient's hand, it is a presentable, courteous professional presenting themselves as an extension of your firm and fulfilling a vital role in our judicial system.\nProcess Servers deliver legal notice to defendants, requiring them to respond to a legal proceeding, which has been scheduled before a court, government body, or tribunal. Notice is normally provided through presentation with Summonses, Complaints, Writs, Subpoenas and other court documents. \nEach state and regional jurisdiction has its own rules regarding service of process. Some documents must be served personally to the individual, while others may be served upon a person of legal age at the intended party's residence or place of employment.\nThe requirements for becoming a legal process server are also varied. There are many states that have no licensing laws, wile others require Servers to be licensed, tested and bonded. Some states have local licensing laws, which are applied, to certain areas. As an example, New York requires licensing through the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs if you are going to serve process in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens. But to serve in the rest of the State, there are other requirements.\nWith the use of advanced methodology, individual State Law and attention to detail, Dueprocesusa provides Service of Process which is only complete once the case is adjudicated. We have an innovative approach to the industry, using the computer technology of the day and fresh customer service techniques.

Talking with the manager today didn't make you feel any better, did it? Managers don't understand all the stress they put on us, and in Japan, it is no different. Every day you will find yourself ready to drop from all the work, not to mention the fact that you are learning to speak Japanese at the same time! Your boss seems concerned though. He asks in Japanese every day, \"Are you all right? Do you feel okay?\" You have all sorts of symptoms of disease...but again, you are still learning to speak Japanese. How do you even begin to tell him in Japanese, \"I have a pounding headache, my eyes are puffy, my ears are ringing, and my throat is sore!\" That's just the beginning, too! Even your skin is prickling. Maybe you've started to pick up allergies? Come to think of it...it all started when that new person came into your little department in the Japanese firm. Do you suppose you're allergic to him? That would be too bad...he's cute.\n\nLearning Japanese with JapanesePod101.com is the most fun and effective way to learn Japanese! This Japanese lesson is all about Japanese onomatopoetic words of the symptoms of disease. You'll learn how to say how you feel in the head, the eyes, the ears, the throat, the stomach, even how your skin feels in Japanese.

If you want to be able to see through your boat's Isinglass, the most important thing is maintaining it properly. Fortunately, we have Chris Breeden here, from Norfolk Marine, to help us figure out how to do just that.\n\nLenny: Chris, what's the number one thing about maintaining Isinglass?\n\nChris: Lenny, you never want to fold it. You always want to roll it from the bottom, up to the top. The next most important thing you want to do is clean the Isinglass. But not with this. Never use any ammonia based cleaning products.\n\nLenny: That's right, it'll turn Isinglass yellow and brittle.\n\nChris: Instead you want to use a plastic cleaner.\n\nLenny: Another important practice is to take it off completely during the winter months, roll it up, and store it at home.\n\nChris: And don't forget to put plain paper on the Isinglass, so it doesn't stick to itself.\n\nLenny: And of course you want to treat your canvass with a sealant so it doesn't leak.\n\nChris: Make sure you do so early in the morning so the water-proofer has time to dry. Even if dew was to get on it, that could ruin the finish.\n\nLenny: Take care of your Isinglass and canvass properly, and it'll last for years.

So first we're going to do skaters. What you're going to do is you're going to lean forward, keep your back flat and your core tight, and you're gonna go back and forth. Just like in a skater movement. So you're going to leap to the right, and as you leap you bring this foot behind you and this arm comes in front of you. Same thing happens on the other side. This arm comes in front of you, and this other leg comes behind. So you're going to go back and forth, in like a skating movement. Keeping you back flat and your core tight. Back and forth. You don't want to lean forward to much. You want to keep your back flat, your shoulders back, so that your back is not rounded. Back and forth. And what this is going to do is it's going to get your heart rate up, you're going to start sweating, like a cardiovascular movement. Do it for about thirty seconds, and you can do two or three sets of this. Back and forth. This is great for your legs, you're going to start feeling it burn outside your legs, your butt.

This trio consists of a young girl, Violet, who lives in a village in Mali, escaping her arranged marriage to an old man; Buba, a mechanic and a skillful footballer, and his older brother Mukela from the neighbouring Niger, who suggests that he go to Europe to try his skills there.\n\nThe characters in the film, although fictitious, are based on real people. In this film, Gerardo Olivares, who has worked as a director of wildlife, cultural, and anthropology documentaries since 1991 and whose films have been shown worldwide by National Geographic and Discovery Channel, has employed many documentary tools. This film is the result of years of research while Olivares was working on various television projects in Africa. All of the public scenes were shot on location with real people. In some of the shots, the general public acknowledges the presence of the camera either by looking through the lens or by suddenly changing direction to avoid being filmed. Although this authentic use of space helps with the understanding of the situation in those locales, it also disrupts the dramatic flow of the story. This becomes less of an issue in the second half, however, as the characters are in the midst of their journey and the film focuses more closely on them as individuals.\n\nThe story unfolds quite like a documentary as well, trying to stay honest about its subjects while showing both sides of the situation. The film tries to depict all those who have failed or died, or survived and lived through this journey, as well as those who are against this dream altogether. Along their way, the trio encounter a group of nomads who believe the future is there in Africa, and that by leaving they are bleeding Africa dry.\n\nThe cinematography is quite beautiful and makes great use of the African scenery and landscapes. There is a nice play on this environment in the framing of the film. Often, close shots of the travelers are juxtaposed with extreme wide shots of them walking in the desert, conveying how little power they have over their surroundings.\n\nAlthough the film may lack the conventional in-depth character study that is common in dramas and which helps the audience to feel more compassionate towards the characters, it is an honest portrayal of the physical and psychological stress that people in those situations go through, and it still makes the audience sympathetic to them. There are some dramatic sub-plots, such as love and death, which the narrative is structured around, but they are never fully utilised in the foreground of the story, and it is essentially the yearning to know whether or not they will make it across to Spain that drives the narrative forward to the end", "title": "14 kil\u00f3metros / 14 kilometers / 14 km (2007) - HQ Theatrical Trailer", "publishedDate": "2009-02-04T13:55:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S-ODexQkFo", "description": "\"One Hundred Sleepless Nights\" from Pierce The Veil's new album 'Collide With The Sky', available now. \n\nGrab 'Collide With The Sky' at Hot Topic, Best Buy, FYE, Fire Brand Store (Europe), or download it now on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/CollideWithTheSky\n\nStay connected with Pierce The Veil:\nhttp://piercetheveil.net\nhttp://facebook.com/piercetheveil\nhttp://twitter.com/piercetheveil", "title": "Pierce The Veil - One Hundred Sleepless Nights (Track 10)", "publishedDate": "2012-07-17T17:55:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S-Oevympts", "description": "MIRABELLA\nWeeknights on ABS-CBN Primetime Bida\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN Online channel! - http://goo.gl/TjU8ZE\n\nVisit our official website! \nhttp://www.abs-cbn.com \nhttp://www.push.com.ph\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/ABSCBNnetwork\n\nTwitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/ABSCBN \nhttps://twitter.com/abscbndotcom\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/abscbnonline\n\nFor full episodes:\nhttp://www.iwantv.com.ph - Philippine viewers\nhttp://www.tfc.tv - outside Philippines", "title": "MIRABELLA Episode: The Rejection", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T12:33:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S-PZ_LNIOA", "description": "More details: http://www.stonemining.net/contact/ \n Get the price of silica production flow chart: http://www.stonemining.net/contact/ \n Zenith as one of the largest mining and crushing equipments manufacturers and vendors all over the world, we provide cone crusehr, jaw crusher, grinding mill, mobile crusher, ball mill, washer machine, vibrating screen, belt conveyor, etc for quarry plant to process iron, gold, aggregate, artificial sand, limestone, asphalt, ballast, bauxite, brick, cement, ceramic, clay, concrete, construction, glass, gypsum, kaolin, coke, coal, barite, bentonite, clinker, dolomite, earth, feldspar, fluorspar, fly ash, garnet, graphite, gravel, marble, talc, mica, perlite, porcelain, pozzolana, quartz, rubble, salt, silica, slate, soapstone, soda, sizing, bottle, aluminum, antimony, calcium, chrome, copper, diamond, hematite, Lead, lithium, magnesium, magnetite, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, pyrite, anthracite,etc.\nZenith company provide quarry plant machine for India, Oman, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Amercia, Indonesia, Sri lanka, Ghana, Uae, Iran, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi arabia, Australia, Thailand, Burma, Yemen, UK, Hungary, British, France, Russian, Gemany, England, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Nigera, Botswana, SA, Nigeria, Uganda, Gabon, Zambia, Ethiopia , Mauritania, USA, Canada, Peru, etc more than 100 countries.\nIf you need the answers of the questions, you can send messages to us or by the online services: http://www.stonemining.net/contact/ \n\n  Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart - Hot Crusher\nCement manufacturing process is mainly divided into three stages, namely, raw meal preparation, clinker burning and cement grinding.\n  CEMEX BANGLADESH | CEMENT BASICS | PRODUCTION FLOW CHART\nCement manufacturing process description.

El pie de atleta, tambi\u00e9n conocido como ti\u00f1a pedis, es una infecci\u00f3n por hongos que afecta a la capa superior de la piel de los pies, especialmente cuando est\u00e1 caliente, h\u00fameda e irritada. El pie de atleta es una forma de ti\u00f1a.\n\nHongos en los pies remedios caseros - Pie de atleta tratamiento natural.\n\nEl hongo que causa el pie de atleta se llama Trichophyton , y se encuentra com\u00fanmente en las plantas y en la ropa. El hongo del pie de atleta no infecta la piel si las condiciones no son las adecuadas, que son un ambiente c\u00e1lido y h\u00famedo. Debido a esto, s\u00f3lo el 0,75% de las personas que caminan con regularidad sobre los pies descalzos se ven afectados.\n\nLos hongos en los pies o pie de atleta generalmente se desarrollan entre los dedos de los pies y de vez en cuando en otras partes de los pies. Por lo general causa ardor, escozor y / o picor. Es el tipo m\u00e1s com\u00fan de infecci\u00f3n por hongos.  Aunque es contagioso, el pie de atleta es generalmente f\u00e1cil de tratar.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los signos y s\u00edntomas de los hongos en los pies o pie de atleta?\n\nUn s\u00edntoma es algo que sentimos y describimos a otras personas, mientras que un signo puede ser visto o detectado por otros. Un ejemplo de un s\u00edntoma es una comez\u00f3n, mientras que un signo puede ser una erupci\u00f3n o enrojecimiento de la piel. La piel de los pies, especialmente entre los dedos de los pies se vuelve escamosa, seca, roja y tambi\u00e9n hay una sensaci\u00f3n de escozor o ardor.\n\nHongos en los pies remedios caseros - Pie de atleta tratamiento natural.\n\nEn casos graves de pie de atleta, los dedos de los pies, las plantas de los pies, y los lados pueden verse afectados La piel tambi\u00e9n se puede romper, puede haber exudaci\u00f3n o costras ampollas e hinchaz\u00f3n. La planta del pie y el lado del pie pueden desarrollar patrones de escala. En casos graves puede haber grietas grandes y aberturas que revelan tejido en bruto. Esto puede ser doloroso y expone al paciente a las infecciones. Si no se trata, existe el riesgo de que la infecci\u00f3n se extienda a partir de un dedo del pie al siguiente, y luego al siguiente, se puede desarrollar una erupci\u00f3n en los lados y la parte inferior de los pies.\n\nOnicomicosis : las u\u00f1as de los pies pueden llegar a ser secas y quebradiza.\n\nHongos en los pies remedios caseros - Pie de atleta tratamiento natural.\n\nSi se rasca el paciente la zona afectada y toca otras partes de su cuerpo, la infecci\u00f3n se puede propagar. Los m\u00e9dicos dicen que es importante tratar los hongos de los pies o pie de atleta, tan pronto como aparezcan los s\u00edntomas. Despu\u00e9s de tocar la zona afectada, recuerde lavarse bien las manos con agua tibia y jab\u00f3n. Los pacientes que no se lavan las manos inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de tocar la zona afectada en su pie / pies est\u00e1n en mayor riesgo.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son las causas de los hongos en los pies o pie de atleta?\n\nEl hongo Trichophyton, se relaciona con otros hongos que causan infecciones en la piel humana, el cabello y las u\u00f1as, los ejemplos incluyen la ti\u00f1a inguinal y la ti\u00f1a del pie. Estas infecciones son causadas por un grupo de hongos llamados dermatofitos. Los dermatofitos son par\u00e1sitos, que se alimentan de otros organismos para sobrevivir.\n\nEstos hongos existen sin causar da\u00f1o en la piel humana. Sin embargo, siempre y cuando la piel est\u00e1 seca y limpia, su reproducci\u00f3n es limitada. En condiciones h\u00famedas y c\u00e1lidas se multiplican r\u00e1pidamente.\n\nLos zapatos apretados gruesos son m\u00e1s propensos a desencadenar el pie de atleta, ya que aprietan los dedos de los pies juntos, creando las condiciones ideales para que el hongo crezca. Los expertos dicen que los zapatos de pl\u00e1stico, calientan y humedecen los pies m\u00e1s, tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de llevar el pie de atleta que las hechas de otros materiales, como el cuero o el lienzo.\n\nHongos en los pies remedios caseros - Pie de atleta tratamiento natural.\n\nSi la prenda est\u00e1 h\u00fameda y tus pies est\u00e1n calientes, hay un mayor  riesgo de desarrollar pie de atleta.", "title": "Hongos en los pies remedios caseros - Pie de atleta tratamiento natural", "publishedDate": "2013-09-05T19:04:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S4rbJ7bRXg", "description": "Iv\u00e1n, uno de nuestros viajeros nos envi\u00f3 algunos peque\u00f1os v\u00eddeos durante su viaje de kayak y trekking a Groenlandia.\n\nEste viaje \u00fanico te da la oportunidad de conocer lugares de una belleza hipnotizante como los frentes glaciares o los fiordos del sur de Groenlandia.\n\nViajar en kayak es quiz\u00e1s la \u00fanica forma de poder tener el privilegio de llegar a estos rincones.", "title": "Viaje a Groenlandia con Tierras Polares", "publishedDate": "2011-09-07T10:04:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S5TuKBqOdE", "description": "Short Tutorial for any NGO or NonProfit online website.\n\nwww.filmbit.de - film company specialized in the NonProfit market\nwww.betterimageclip.com - find a DSLR cameraman-journalist worldwide for your films", "title": "5 Biggest Mistakes at Non Profit Websites", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15T15:17:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S5UcRirp7g", "description": "raza raju", "title": "Flood In Dir Lower Timergara Talash Shamshe Khan Khowar", "publishedDate": "2010-08-10T15:17:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4S5WA8yN5QY", "description": "A WA pensioner has been caught out importing the euthanasia drug Nembutal.

Around 150 of the dolphins live around the Melbourne area and had until now been assumed to be one of the known bottlenose dolphins.\n\nBut detailed DNA studies and analysis of skulls in museums showed the two populations are in fact a new species. The new classification as Tursiops australis is described in PLoS One. The common name of Burrunan dolphins derives from the Aboriginal Australian for \"large sea fish of the porpoise kind\".\n\nPrevious research had shown that the DNA found in the dolphins differed from that of the known bottlenose species Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus.\n\nBut in order to define a new species, more evidence is needed. Kate Charlton-Robb of Monash University in Melbourne and her colleagues studied dolphin skulls found in a number of museums, as well as more detailed analysis of DNA, to show that T. australis is clearly a different animal.\n\n\"This is an incredibly fascinating discovery as there have only been three new dolphin species formally described and  recognised since the late 1800s,\" Ms Charlton-Robb said.\n\n\"What makes this even more exciting is this dolphin species has been living right under our noses, with only two known resident populations living in Port Phillip Bay and the Gippsland Lakes in Victoria state.\" In fact, now that it is recognised as a separate species it may immediately qualify under Australia's criteria for endangered animals.\n\n\"The formal recognition of this new species is of great importance to correctly manage and protect this species, and has significant bearing on the prioritisation of conservation efforts,\" the authors wrote. \"This is especially crucial given its endemism to a small region of the world, with only two small known resident populations.\"", "title": "New dolphin species discovered in Melbourne", "publishedDate": "2011-09-15T12:56:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4SDLiu5G5hs", "description": "An overall shoulder variation\n\nIn this episode, Amanda Latona demonstrates a variation of the typical upright row using plates instead of dumbbells.
