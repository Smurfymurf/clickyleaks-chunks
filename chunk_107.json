The absence of bone changes makes this pre-skeletal phase difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are indistinguishable from common forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nEven when bone changes do develop, correct diagnosis can remain elusive.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Many more admitted they had no faith that the Pakistani government could help them.The army said at least 200 militants, many of them Uzbeks, had been killed since it began air strikes on militant targets in Shawal and other areas of North Waziristan last Sunday.There is no independent media access to the area and no way of confirming the casualty figures.Tanks and troops are also being sent in for a full-scale operation to target Taliban and foreign militant networks based near the Afghan border, the military says.North Waziristan has a population of almost seven million. Officials say approximately 80% of the population is still living in the area as the military strikes escalate.abc breaking news, bbc, bbc football, bbc iplayer, bbc news, bbc news america, bbc persian, bbc sport, bbc weather, bbc world news, breaking celebrity news, breaking election news, breaking late news, breaking local news, breaking music news, breaking news, breaking news alerts, breaking news canada, breaking news headlines, breaking news in atlanta, breaking news in nigeria, breaking news india, breaking news pensacola florida, breaking news plane crash, breaking news story, breaking sports news, business expensive news home media world, christian world news, cnn, cnn breaking news, cnn money, cnn news, cnn news breaking news, cnn news world, detroit breaking news, global news, headline, headline news, health care technology news, hot latest global news, internet technology news, las vegas breaking news, latest breaking news, latest celebrity news, latest information technology news, latest music news, latest news, latest news headlines, latest news update, latest sports news, live breaking news, local breaking news, local news today, msn breaking news, nbc breaking news, nbc world news, news of the world, news report us world, news today news, news updated daily, solar technology news, sports news today, technology news, the latest news, today news, us news and world, us news and world report, us news and world report magazine, us news and world report web site, us news world report, world news, world news daily, world news headlines", "title": "PAKISTAN ARMY  Waziristan Offensive 350,000 DISPLACED   BBC WORLD NEWS 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-23T14:34:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5j9peljgSqY", "description": "Disregard the fail first attempt!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/coL_Karma\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/karmaisbos -- www.twitch.tv/karma/c/3723682&utm_campaign=archive_export&utm_source=karma&utm_medium=youtube", "title": "Cool Start Off From C Hardpoint on Fracture!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T02:01:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5j9vBSJQkac", "description": "Link do programu AVS Video Editor. \nhttp://www.dobreprogramy.pl/AVS-Video-Editor,Program,Windows,36779.html\nPozdrawiam ;)", "title": "Jak po\u0142\u0105czy\u0107 dwa filmy w jeden film..", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T13:35:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "5jA5T1Sq8-U", "description": "This is a chemistry video where a titration was made between NaOH and HCl, where HCl was the added substance and bromthymol blue, an indicator, was present.

He obeys the elders and always prays on time.\"  Such is the sentiment of many Muslim parents regarding their children.  But when Muhammad goes off to school, does he become Mo?  Does Ali become Al?  Does Khadijah become Katie?  Do we really know how our children behave once they step foot outside the home on their own and enter a realm dominated by secular, anti-Islamic influences?  Imam Quick, a respected social worker and father of nine, brings to light this problem of the two-faced child.  He looks at secular society's corruption of the youth culture and how Muslim youth have been infested with radical and strange behavior.  Whether in public schools, with friends, or through the TV and internet, our children are at risk on a daily basis.  He emphasizes the need for combating the overwhelming negativity with practical alternatives that can attract the youth to the masjid.  A critical session for youth, parents, imams and community leaders, all of whom share in the responsibility of resolving this dilemma before it's too late.  Other topics discussed: how to handle the two-faced adult, the crisis of homosexuality, defending oneself, Islam vs. culture, using wisdom in applying Islam, marriage at a young age, and being proactive.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Learn to Read Hindi - And Grab Yourself a Cafe!", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T13:37:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "5jQH85vJ5Nk", "description": "Upshot CU Sara Hall original \"Hey\" @ Bunny's. 6/14/14 Urbana, IL \nMembers Sara Hall - Vocals/Guitar\nMatt Zimmerman - Lead Guitar/Vocals\nJared Manker - Bass/Guitar\nSeth Anders - Sax/Vocals\nPeety Thomas - Drums", "title": "\"Hey\" Upshot Band CU @ Bunny's 6/14/14 Urbana, IL", "publishedDate": "2014-06-16T11:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5jQmILJhrT8", "description": "Plantei no Jardem de casa essa mudinha que ganhei em um Hotel Fazenda na Cidade de Calda Novas-GOFlor \"Papo de Peru\"", "title": "Flor \"Papo de Peru\" na casa Jose Magalh\u00e3es  - Bras\u00edlia 12dez2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-16T10:47:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5jQpbt4ZyK8", "description": "Live from Mamasongas on Vieques Island Puerto Rico.", "title": "Vieques Dramatic Iguana 2", "publishedDate": "2014-07-29T01:41:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5jQq6BiT-eI", "description": "Side Effects, starring Rooney Mara, Channing Tatum, Jude Law. \nJoin us on Facebook http://facebook.com/FreshMovieTrailers \nBest DRAMAS  are Here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zA0Ll2xphQ&list=SP0387F4FAEDFD7EF8\n\nSide Effects Trailer\nDirected By Steven Soderbergh \nRelease Date :February 8, 2013. \nFrom the creators of Contagion.

For only 10 ringgit she had this lovely design drawn on her hands and forearm which took 30 minutes to dry before she could peel it off at KL Sentral.  You'll see clips of us showcasing the artist in a time lapse sequence.  For just over $3 you can have this done as well while touring the Batu Caves.\n\nHenna (Lawsonia inermis, also called henna tree[1]) or Hina is a flowering plant, the sole species in the genus Lawsonia in the family Lythraceae. The English name \"henna\" comes from the Arabic \u062d\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0627\u0621 (ALA-LC: \u1e25inn\u0101\u02be / pronounced [\u0127\u026an\u02c8n\u00e6\u02d0\u0294]) or colloquially \u062d\u0646\u0627, loosely pronounced /\u0127inna/.\nThe name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant, and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes. Henna has been used since antiquity to dye skin, hair, and fingernails. \n\nHenna has been used since the Bronze Age to dye skin (including body art), hair, fingernails, leather, silk and wool. In several parts of the world it is traditionally used in various festivals and celebrations. There is mention of henna as a hair dye in Indian court \n\n\nLawsone, an active compound in Henna\nUse of henna for body art has enjoyed a recent renaissance due to improvements in cultivation, processing, and the emigration of people from traditional henna-using regions.\n\nWhole, unbroken henna leaves will not stain the skin. Henna will not stain skin until the lawsone molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaf. Fresh henna leaves will stain the skin if they are smashed with a mildly acidic liquid. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the proteins in it, creating a fast stain.\nSince it is difficult to form intricate patterns from coarse crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder made by drying, milling and sifting the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with lemon juice, strong tea, or other mildly acidic liquids to make a preparation with toothpaste-like consistency, which can be used to make finely detailed body art. The henna mix must rest for 6 to 24 hours before use, to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. Essential oils with high levels of monoterpene alcohols such as tea tree, eucalyptus, cajeput, or lavender will improve skin stain characteristics.\nThe paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, including resist, a cone, syringe, Jac bottle or fingers. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, the longer the paste is left on the skin, the stronger the stain will be, and should be left for several hours. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. It is debatable whether this adds to the color of the end result; some believe it increases the intensity of the shade. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.\nHenna stains are orange soon after application, but darken over the following three days to a reddish brown. Soles and palms have the thickest layer of skin and so take up the most lawsone, and take it to the greatest depth, so that hands and feet will have the darkest and most long-lasting stains. Steaming or warming the henna pattern will darken the stain, either during the time the paste is still on the skin, or after the paste has been removed. Chlorinated water and soaps may spoil the darkening process: alkaline products may hasten the darkening process. After the stain reaches its peak color it will appear to fade, as the stained dead cells exfoliate.\n\nBatu Caves (Tamil: \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bb2\u0bc8), is a limestone hill, which has a series of caves and cave temples, in the Gombak district, 13 kilometres (8 mi) north of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It takes its name from the Sungai Batu or Batu River, which flows past the hill. Batu Caves is also the name of the nearby village.\nThe cave is one of the most popular Hindu shrines outside India, dedicated to Lord Murugan. It is the focal point of Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Malaysia series.

Part 17 of my documentary, \"Mucky Secrets\", about the fascinating marine creatures of the Lembeh Strait in Indonesia. Watch the full 90-minute documentary at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJMZ6reOB0E\n\nAs we continue to examine molluscs (mollusks, Mollusca)  in this documentary series, we take a quick look at the electric flame scallop (Ctenoides ales), otherwise known as the \"disco clam\", \"fire clam\" or \"electric clam\". The flame scallop is a type of bivalve (Bivalvia). It appears to emit luminescent electrical pulses, but actually it is rolling and unrolling the edges of its mantle, revealing special particles that simply reflect light. The display is thought to attract phytoplankton as food and perhaps frighten off predators like crabs and shrimps.\n\nWe then turn our attention to sea snail (gastropods, Gastropoda). The grey bonnet (Phalium glaucum) is a typical sea snail. It has a protective, coiled shell that it can withdraw its entire body into. It glides over the substrate on its large, muscular foot, and at the rear we see the operculum, a hard lid that is used to close the opening of the shell after the snail withdraws into it. Two simple eyes peer out from under the front of the shell, and important sensory feedback also comes from the two tentacles. To one side is the inhalent siphon, a tube that the sea snail uses to draw in water for respiration.\n\nThe anatomy of another gastropod, the vomer conch (Euprotomus vomer), is different. Its mouth is much more obvious, at the end of a long protrusion called a proboscis. It is strictly a herbivore, and it uses the proboscis for locating and eating algae growing in the sand. It's eyes are much more prominent too, at the end of long stalks, and jutting out from these stalks are two highly sensitive tentacles. Rather than gliding, it uses its operculum to drag itself along the bottom in a lurching motion.\n\nConchs are a popular food, and their shells have symbolic and religious significance in some cultures. They have been used for everything from musical instruments, to weapons, to ink holders.\n\nWe then encounter a whitespotted hermit crab inhabiting an empty cone shell. The main sensory device of cones like the ivory cone (Conus eburneus) is the siphon itself which contains highly sensitive chemoreceptors. If it detects suitable prey the cone will unleash a harpoon from its proboscis containing a highly venomous neurotoxin, powerful enough to kill humans.\n\nThere are English captions showing either the full narration or the common and scientific names of the marine life, along with the dive site names.\n\nThe full Mucky Secrets nature documentary features a huge diversity of weird and wonderful marine animals including frogfish, nudibranchs, scorpionfish, crabs, shrimps, moray eels, seahorses, octopus, cuttlefish etc..\n\nThanks to Kevin MacLeod of http://www.incompetech.com for the music track, \"Scheming Weasel (slower version)\", which is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license.\n\nThanks to the staff and keen-eyed divemasters of Two Fish Divers (http://www.twofishdivers.com), for accommodation, diving services and critter-spotting.\n\nThe video was shot by Nick Hope with a Sony HVR-Z1P HDV camera in a Light & Motion Bluefin HD housing with Light & Motion Elite lights and a flat port.

Taylor Swift has FINALLY debuted a second track off her 1989 album and we we OB-SESSED.\n\nJust when you thought Tay couldn\u2019t top the perfection that is \u201cShake It Off,\u201d she debuts \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d and just proves how FREAKING talented she is. The track isn\u2019t her latest single off her upcoming album \u2014 that drops on October 27, by the way \u2014 but a promo song Taylor said she feels best represents the album as a whole.\n\nTake a listen.\n\nChilling good, right? The haunting pop track was produced and co-written by fun. and Bleach-er\u2019s Jack Antonoff, aka the BF of her BFF Lena Dunham, and these two are like a musical dream team. Though Taylor won\u2019t admit outright that the song is about her ex Harry Styles, one lyric in particular prettyyyy much confirms it\u2019s TOTALLY about him.\n\nAt one point in the song, Taylor belts out these lyrics:\n\n\u201cLooking at it now, Last December, we were built to fall apart, Then fall back together, Your necklace hanging from my neck, The night we couldn\u2019t quite forget\u201d\n\nRemember when Haylor sparked romance rumors when Taylor was seen wearing Harry\u2019s neck-lace? Yep, we see you girl. Nothing gets past us!\n\nAnother ominous set of lyrics comes when Taylor mentions the snow skiing accident she and Harry were reportedly part of in December 2012, and how emotional it was \u2014 he cried, you guys! Ms. Swift also mentions a possible nod to breaking up with HIM when she sings about set-ting him free. But then she also references monsters being trees, which, offers some comedic relief.\n\nTaylor herself spilled a fun little detail on Twitter after the song\u2019s release saying this:\n\n\u201cFor the next 13 days leading up to 1989, I'll be posting one lyric from each of the 13 tracks each day. #1989\u201d\n\nLet the speculation begin! Taylor also adorably fangirled on Instagram after the song went to number one and say she couldn\u2019t even handle it. We\u2019re with you, girl. \n\nWhat do YOU guys think of \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d? Is it even better than \u201cShake It Off\u201d?!

With only four species, it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia. Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components to most African and some Asian ecosystems.\n\nAlthough phylogenetically close to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several aspects; both hyenas and canines are nonarboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable nails are adapted for running and making sharp turns. However, the hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating habits, mating, and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of other feliforms. Although long reputed to be cowardly scavengers, hyenas, especially spotted hyenas, kill as much as 95% of the food they eat, and have been known to drive off leopards or lionesses from their kills. Hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals, but may venture from their lairs in the early-morning hours. With the exception of the highly social spotted hyena, hyenas are generally not gregarious animals, though they may live in family groups and congregate at kills.\n\n-Vulture-\n\nVulture is the name given to two groups of convergently evolved, usually scavenging birds of prey: the New World vultures, including the Californian and Andean condors; and the Old World vultures, including the birds that are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains. Research has shown that some traditional Old World Vultures (including the Bearded Vulture) are not closely related to the others, which is why the vultures are to be subdivided into three taxa rather than two. New World vultures are found in North and South America; Old World vultures are found in Europe, Africa and Asia, meaning that between the two groups, vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica.", "title": "Hyenas & Vultures Brutal Killing #HD - Wild Feeding Moments", "publishedDate": "2014-08-08T00:15:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5kYR3lxQti4", "description": "", "title": "David Shire - The Taking Of Pelham 123 Theme", "publishedDate": "2009-12-12T00:19:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "5kYi5oqVtOA", "description": "Sivapithecus Sivalensis mandible fragment from the Siwalik Hills of Northern India.", "title": "Sivapithecus Sivalensis Mandible Fragment 2", "publishedDate": "2008-05-16T03:27:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "5kYiJAwVbEs", "description": "", "title": "Ostrich sound", "publishedDate": "2014-03-31T19:23:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "5kZWyl3X9ls", "description": "\u5357\u7c73\u306e\u52d5\u7269\u3092\u6df7\u5408\u98fc\u80b2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ea\u30c3\u30d2\u52d5\u7269\u5712\u306e\u5c4b\u5916\u65bd\u8a2dPantanal\uff08\u30d1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ca\u30fc\u30eb\uff09\u306e\u5ddd\u3092\u6cf3\u3050\u30b7\u30ed\u30ac\u30aa\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac\u30e2\nhttp://mizuchi02.blog129.fc2.com/\uff08\u8a18\u4e8b\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306eBlog\u306bUP\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff09", "title": "\u9cf4\u304d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6cf3\u3050\u30b7\u30ed\u30ac\u30aa\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30ac\u30e2", "publishedDate": "2013-03-19T10:34:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "5kZ_p59eWA8", "description": "Recorded solution for \"It Takes Three\" from SpaceChem, a design-based puzzle game from Zachtronics Industries.\n\nDownload the demo at http://www.spacechemthegame.com today!", "title": "SpaceChem - It Takes Three (238/1/29)", "publishedDate": "2011-07-03T15:49:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5k_-lYgz5fA", "description": "\u300e\u52a0\u5730\u7b49\u304c\u3044\u305f \uff0d\u50d5\u306e\u6b4c\u3092\u8074\u3044\u3068\u304f\u308c\uff0d\u300f\u300e\u8033\u3092\u304b\u304f\u5973\u300f\u306a\u3069\u306e\u6c17\u92ed\u3001\u5800\u5185\u535a\u5fd7\u306b\u3088\u308b\u9752\u6625\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u3002\u9b31\u5c48\u00ad\uff08\u3046\u3063\u304f\u3064\uff09\u3057\u305f\u65e5\u3005\u3092\u751f\u304d\u308b\u9752\u5e74\u3068\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u65ad\u5ff5\u3057\u305f\u5c11\u5973\u306e\u4ea4\u6d41\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u639b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u00ad\u304f\u3002\u300e\u5730\u7403\u9632\u885b\u672a\u4ea1\u4eba\u300f\u306a\u3069\u306e\u5927\u91ce\u672a\u6765\u3068\u300c\u70c8\u8eca\u6226\u968a\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u300d\u306e\u5e73\u7267\u4ec1\u304c\u3001\u4e3b\u00ad\u4eba\u516c\u306e\u7537\u5973\u3092\u529b\u6f14\u3002\u305d\u306e\u8107\u3092\u30bf\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u6c60\u7530\u30b7\u30e7\u30b3\u30e9\u3001\u5409\u7530\u672a\u4f86\u3089\u304c\u56fa\u3081\u308b\u3002\u968f\u6240\u3067\u307b\u3068\u00ad\u3070\u3057\u308b\u5800\u5185\u76e3\u7763\u306e\u9bae\u70c8\u306a\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3001\u73fe\u4ee3\u306e\u82e5\u8005\u304c\u62b1\u3048\u308b\u50b7\u3084\u95c7\u3092\u6df1\u304f\u898b\u3064\u3081\u305f\u7269\u8a9e\u306b\u00ad\u3082\u6ce8\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u6d3b\u52d5\u3092\u7d9a\u3051\u308b3\u4eba\u7d44\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u7d76\u5bfe\u9818\u57df\u3002\u540c\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u00ad\u30d7\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u5ddd\u5cf6\u30df\u30aa\uff08\u5927\u91ce\u672a\u6765\uff09\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u304c\u5897\u52a0\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3055\u307e\u3092\u5b9f\u611f\u3057\u3001\u6e80\u3061\u8db3\u308a\u305f\u00ad\u65e5\u3005\u3092\u9001\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3093\u306a\u4e2d\u3001\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u4f1a\u5834\u3067\u5f15\u304d\u3053\u3082\u308a\u306e\u9752\u5e74\u30fb\u7247\u5c71\u30de\u30b5\u30ad\uff08\u5e73\u7267\u4ec1\uff09\u3068\u00ad\u51fa\u4f1a\u3046\u3002\u305d\u306e\u3046\u3061\u3001\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3068\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u95a2\u4fc2\u3092\u8d85\u8d8a\u3057\u305f\u5947\u5999\u306a\u7d46\u3092\u80b2\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\u30df\u30aa\u3068\u00ad\u7247\u5c71\u3002\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3042\u308b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3092\u767a\u7aef\u306b\u3057\u3066\u7d76\u5bfe\u9818\u57df\u306f\u89e3\u6563\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u7247\u5c71\u304c\u30df\u30aa\u306e\u524d\u304b\u3089\u3053\u3064\u305c\u00ad\u3093\u3068\u59ff\u3092\u6d88\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002", "title": "\u7d76\u5bfe\u9818\u57df 3\u670815\u65e5\u516c\u958b\u4e88\u5b9a", "publishedDate": "2014-03-15T14:00:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "5k_KHa6_fE8", "description": "The golden monkey [Cercopithecus kandti] is a species of Old World monkey found in the highland forest within the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa.

He said he wasn't sure what would happen to his existing Twitter account, which has significantly fewer followers. \"Maybe it'll just be mothballed for a little while until I get ready to leave,\" he said.  Earnest also shared his personal views on Twitter's role in politics and admitted he may need to step up his game a bit. \"I have to admit that I am a pretty avid consumer of Twitter; I am probably not the most skilled contributor to Twitter in that I'm not a frequent Twitterer. I'm going to have to ramp up my activities.\"  Since joining Twitter in September 2011, Earnest has only posted 377 tweets, an average of just 12 tweets per month. He told Allen that when he first started working at the White House he had never even heard of the service. With 2,592 tweets since February 2010, which included one year of Robert Gibbs' tenure, @PressSec did only moderately better, averaging about 49 tweets per month.  But now, he said, his office is following the Twitter activity of the White House press corps, which includes prolific \"Twitterers\" like MSNBC's Chuck Todd (37.5K tweets since 2009) and Fox News' Ed Henry (20.2K tweets since 2010). \"It's a good way for us to take the temperature of the White House press corps,\" he said, adding that it helps him know what questions to expect when he takes the podium for his (now) daily briefing.  As for Carney, he quietly moved over to @JayCarney on Friday, though he was unfortunately not able to take his more than 500,000 followers with him.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Independently, we'd worked in different parts of Asia for some years. At 7 months, I arrived in Nelson (NZ for 1st time)...In hand, a medical certificate signed by US trained and certified Ob/gyn at an International hospital in Bangkok. Unfortunately suffered 50/50 survival rate of a second dose of Dengue Fever at start of pregnancy. I was 35 years and first pregnancy. At 4 months I had an Amnio, showing  a large, well developed baby girl. I adored living/working in Asia, learning languages, new work experience, cultural etc. My Kiwi husband from Nelson and I married first in Bangkok.  My partner needed to go home so I decided to follow him 3 months later. I was healthy, fit and as you'll see, no deformities or any type of disability what so ever!\n\nIt was eventful. On day three (in the country) I started lightly bleeding which the Nelson Ob/gyn concluded may be related to the 14 hours in the air from Bangkok to Sydney to Auckland to Wellington to Nelson = A Long Haul. I spent two nights in Nelson Public Maternity. After numerous scans and tests the Nelson Ob/gyn reported baby and I were healthy. I'd gained the right amount of weight, some musculature aches and pains but all was good. On day two we found an Independent Midwife (at time did 8% of Nelson region's births) with \"More than 25 years experience\".\n\nOn day six into New Zealand my partner somehow threw together a lovely little wedding in a historic trust building now used as a small bed and breakfast, run by a good friend of my partners. \n\nTwo months later a hideous event occurred. Baby was well over 10 days over due, decided to come on day scheduled for induction.   \n\nThe Midwife refused to call in the doctor after an epidural administered at end of second stage brought the birth to a halt. Midwife spoke of her last resort and started ordering my unwell (borderline septicemic due to previous pancreatic cancer) husband to get me into the next room to place me on top of the toilet. I was dead weight and weighed more than my partner. He had to \"Heave\" me up and across the room. I was inappropriately and excessively mishandled and dropped several times during the last stages of the delivery. My husband held me under my arm pits above himself. My body slammed on the seat and I was propped up in a disturbing way, the shape of my belly and placement of baby looked like she was twisting and then I worried she'd make a splash. Midwife stayed out of bathroom but made a joke before telling my husband to get me back on the table. I was dropped on the floor against the side of the birthing table. Some how they heaved me back on the table, legs swinging with force. Quite brutal! I was leaned up on my knees against the folded up side of the table which the Midwife let drop with me face down. In a semi sitting position Midwife grabbed my right leg and \"Yanked it\" up, to the side and up into an over head stirip in an angle no leg should go!   Baby bounced in at 8 pound 14 ounces with 9 and 10 on Apgar scale.   Midwife and her husband, business partner and secretary insisted: Normal Birth and \"Forgot\" the rest!    \n\nThere I was in tiny little Nelson with an American accent and hurt more badly than I could ever have imagined! My husband's trying to retire GP and friend on Midwife for \"More than 25 years\" loathed Americans juts on principal. (His letters prove as much!) \n\nMy husband landed in hospital with septicemia and I was unable to lift my 3 month old baby. My first ACC Case Manager to me to \"Go home to my own country\" and what I needed was \"A good kick up the back side\".\n\nDespite evidence showing a \"Severe Degenerative Slip\" along with other serious injury affects all the way up my spine 3 South Island Specialists insisted \"No injury\" It's been all about the racist gossip which has entitled \"Many\" do \"Sort that American...out!\"...The GP insisted I'd changed sides of complaint when I tried to explain the agony. GP asked if I suffered any pre-existing back problems. I said no but had a mild curvature (as had me Mum and her Mum) but no deformity or disability of any kind. As I explained how fit and active I had been, the GP stated and wrote: \"Long term spinal disabilities\"...The Snow Ball from Hell\" fed by jealousy and resentment had well begun! Most lower, middle and upper end of the medical people appeared to feel entitled, almost empowered and righteous about \"Fixing\" me! \n\nThe racist little comments and notes in my medical file held more weight than the actual medical facts! I waited 18 months and had to hire an attorney before my ACC claim was accepted after being mysteriously \"\"Lost\" twice and found in St Georges Hospital's tip 3 months after I'd had the second of two wrongfully timed diagnostic steroid injections....

If you want to surprise your man. Like sneak up on him and give him a smooch out of the blue, there's a good way to do it and there's  a wrong way to do it. The wrong way to do it is like tongue in mouth, tongue in ear. Like, this isn't a Law and Order SVU moment.\n\nSo I'll show you how to do it so that he likes it and gets just a little bit excited.\n\nMichael Blaustein:  Same side as the football team. I'm good. So when you're trying to surprise your girl you always go neck kiss first. And this is why.\n\nShallon:  So then I was like, watermelons are not grown with stripes on. You are not even listening to what I'm saying, are you? No. You're just thinking about like hooking up because that's all you think about. That and Xbox. Halo, World of Warcraft, sex. That's all.\n\nMichael:  Nah. I just wanted to kiss you. \n\nShallon:  Guys, if you kiss a girl when she's in the middle of a sentence, you might think it's super romantic and amazing but she might think that it means you don't really care what she's saying. Granted, chances are this is true. But you don't want a woman to know this. So when you want a sneak attack kiss, give it to her on the neck. Okay? Like so.\n\nShallon:  Jon Bon Jovi is like 89 years old. No! It was totally on his Wikipedia page. He's like beef jerky. Then I, I gotta call you back. Hi. \n\nMichael:  Hey. I think Bon Jovi's like 112 I think.\n\nShallon:  My gosh, I so knew that. You're so..\n\nMichael:  Yeah. All I..\n\nShallon:  So guys, if you're talking to your girl and you really want to kiss her but you don't want to make her think you're not listening to her story, which you're probably not, that's fine. Say one little thing that ties in her topic and then go for the neck and work your way up. By the time you get from here to there, she's gonna be putty in your hands. \n\nSo Julie said that the Wooten clan like invented killer bees and I'm like no. JZ and Cisco invented killer bees. I mean, who doesn't even know that?\n\nMichael:  JZ and Cisco?\n\nShallon:  Yeah.\n\nMichael:  Killer bees, you say?\n\nShallon:  Yeah.

Nos gustar\u00eda tener todo, pero entonces tendr\u00edamos una ferreter\u00eda en casa.\nHay herramientas muy vers\u00e1tiles, que adem\u00e1s de su uso cotidiano, tambi\u00e9n le podemos dar otras utilidades.\nVenden en el mercado aparatos para afilado de brocas, adem\u00e1s accesorios para taladros que acoplados a este, suele hacer la funci\u00f3n perfecta de afilado, ... pero no suele durar mucho si no es de buena calidad.\nYo, suelo usar mucho la radial, y de vez en cuando, cuando una broca no corta por desgaste, o por rotura, tengo una esmeriladora, pero esta pesa tanto que no la puedo tener en todos los sitios en los que trabajo, entonces improviso y con una amoladora hago esta funci\u00f3n de afilado, y ya son muchas las puntas tanto a brocas, hierros, incluso el l\u00e1piz, que he afilado.(Es otra forma de darle utilidad a la amoladora) \u00a1\u00a1Con mucho cuidado y precauci\u00f3n!!\nSaludos, \u00c1ngel\n\nHola a tod@s.\nUna radial es una herramienta muy utilizada para muchos oficios.\nDebemos saber que adem\u00e1s es peligrosa, pero no mucho m\u00e1s que cualquier otra herramienta haciendo mal uso de ella.\nTenemos que tener, eso s\u00ed, mucha m\u00e1s precauci\u00f3n y entre otras enumero algunas:\n- Utilizar nuestros EPIS, equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual gafas, ropa, calzado,... Muy importante y obligatorio gafas, (no la utilices si no tienes a mano unas gafas que impidan entrada de part\u00edculas en los ojos)\n- No quitar ni anular las protecciones originales que trae la m\u00e1quina.\n- Utilizar un disco para cada material: hay discos espec\u00edficos para m\u00e1rmol, granito, hormig\u00f3n, para metales hierro, o acero inoxidable. Adem\u00e1s puede haber de distintos grosores.\n-El disco siempre bien apretado con sus tuercas de agarre, si est\u00e1 da\u00f1ado desecharlo.\n- Utilizar en zonas en donde no haya ni\u00f1os alrededor.\n- Saber que las chispas que salten pueden provocar quemaduras, o incendios si caen en sitios d\u00f3nde haya materiales inflamables. Y tambi\u00e9n deteriorar todo lo que haya alrededor, baldosas, cristales, madera,.... Proteger  de las chispas que salten\n- Utilizar siempre  que se pueda con dos manos y asirla fuertemente.\n- La pieza a cortar si es posible siempre amarrada a un tornillo de banco, u otro,..\n-  Y as\u00ed una serie de indicaciones y normas a cumplir que son para nuestra seguridad y la de los que nos rodean.\n....\n\nBien, una vez que sabemos c\u00f3mo funciona una radial, que la conocemos y  sabemos sus partes, modo de utilizaci\u00f3n ya podemos empezar a utilizarla siempre con mucha precauci\u00f3n.\n\nSu uso es muy variado y para cortar muchos materiales.\n Lo importante es que no se mueva. Se empieza a cortar muy suave de atr\u00e1s a adelante, sin apretar mucho el disco. Primero se marca la l\u00ednea. Luego ya se va profundizando poco a poco. Las chispas que salen  son muy escandalosas, pueden provocar quemaduras, incendio,...Hay que tener mucho cuidado, nuestra radial viene provista de un protector que dirige las chispas hacia un lado. Nosotros nos pondremos al refugio de esta seguridad, es decir en el lado contrario. Las chispas no nos afectar\u00e1n de esta forma. De vez en cuando dejaremos descansar la radial, que no se caliente, y miraremos si el disco est\u00e1 correcto. Cuando ya est\u00e9 casi todo cortado, le dejaremos un poco sin cortar de forma que la pieza no caiga al suelo, pues  hay que saber que el peso de la pieza a cortar caer\u00e1  al suelo por lo podemos evitar si dejamos un poco sin cortar por la parte inferior, lo justo para que aguante y que con la mano lo podamos partir. Hay otras soluciones, pero  lo importante, es que el peso del tubo al cortar no ceda y aprisione el disco, por eso siempre el corte ira en piezas sin tensi\u00f3n, y por la parte de arriba.\nHay muchas formas, maneras, modos, de hacer los cortes. La pr\u00e1ctica  ir\u00e1 poco a poco mostr\u00e1ndonos que podemos variar y mejorar en el uso de esta m\u00e1quina que si la sabemos utilizar nos ayudar\u00e1 en nuestros trabajos.\nPero acordarse siempre.

NO LA UTILICES  y Utiliza otra herramienta\nSaludos. \u00c1ngel", "title": "Afilado de brocas con radial.", "publishedDate": "2012-07-16T13:06:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "5l5E4Iiqq8c", "description": "This is a segment from Episode 8 of Todd Richards' AWSM on Alli.

John, a tomato farmer in Orange County, California, explains how growing heirloom tomatoes and organic tomatoes is a better choice than growing hybrid tomatoes. \n\nRather than using an upside down tomato garden, John works the soil with an organic planting mix containing calcium and a fertilizer with a Nitrogen, Phosophorous and Potassium ratio of about 8:11:10. John says that too much nitrogen will cause the tomato plants to have leafy greens, but little fruit.\n\nPruning tomatoes is also important. Be sure to cut off the wild runners that don't produce and sap the plant, says John. Tomato cages are important for keeping the plant growing tall and the fruit off of the ground.\n\nJohn has found that the best tomato producers in his garden include the Yellow Oxheart tomatoes, mortgage lifter tomatoes and Jubilee tomatoes. He also enjoys planting a variety of cherry tomato plants.\n\nTo learn more tomato gardening tips, go to http://www.CookingSessions.com SUBSCRIBE! http://tinyurl.com/kfrblj7\nLIKE ME ON FACEBOOK http://www.Facebook.com/ChefTips\nCIRCLE ME ON GOOGLE PLUS http://tinyurl.com/kabpxd9\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER https://twitter.com/ChefTips\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM http://instagram.com/ChefTips", "title": "Tomato Garden", "publishedDate": "2010-08-18T04:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lMmhYMcQFQ", "description": "Beschreibung", "title": "Tint bristly eyebrows with using BlondeBrow before tinting", "publishedDate": "2014-08-14T08:13:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lN0Om_8Ccg", "description": "", "title": "Mujeres - Calabrese Fingers", "publishedDate": "2013-11-11T12:08:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lNFaJxfVBk", "description": "O Premio Santander Universidades \u00e9 uma das maiores iniciativas de reconhecimento para universit\u00e1rios, professores, pesquisadores, e as institui\u00e7\u00f5es de ensino superior do Brasil.

Baguazhang training is extraordinarily effective in terms of practical application and health rejuvenation aspects.Yin Yang-Baguazhang asserts great importance in internal/external cultivation, equanimity, breathing, foot work, receptiveness to absorb the essence of the Universe/Heaven/Earth and develop a unifying state of body, mind, and spirit.", "title": "Wudang Baguazhang & Yin Yang Hands", "publishedDate": "2013-03-25T11:01:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lQFeL_NP84", "description": "", "title": "Intendente de moreno mariano Federico West Ocampo", "publishedDate": "2012-05-08T20:13:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lQR--rjxE8", "description": "Official Music Video for Tribal Theory - Stuck In The Middle\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hell-of-a-night/id553666803\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/tribaltheory\nhttp://tribaltheorymusic.com/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TribalTheoryMusic\nhttps://twitter.com/tribaltheory\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tribaltheory\ninstagram @tribaltheory", "title": "Tribal Theory - Stuck In The Middle (official music video)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-17T18:37:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lQfqdIwfkA", "description": "Carnivorous plants have pests like regular plants, learn how to care for carnivorous plants like the Venus Fly Trap in this free video.\n\nExpert: Wes Major\nContact: www.equilibriocarnivorousplants.com\nBio: Wes Major has extensive experience in working with nearly every species of carnivorous plant.

I need to look up what the commentators think about, maybe problematic verses. And I come up with an outline and a basic, you might say, an exegesis or an exposition of the passage itself.\u00a0\nI write this up and I send it to my musicians. We're going to be putting it in a bulletin and then they're going to be choosing music for it.\u00a0 I send it to other preachers who some of them are going to be preaching sermons on the same text.\u00a0\nThen, three days before, I sit down with this outline and I spend another four hours turning the bible study into a sermon--and they're not the same thing.\u00a0 Bible study is more abstract, what does the text say.\u00a0 The sermon is more life related, what does this mean to me.\u00a0\nSo I spend four hours two weeks ahead on the text.\u00a0 I spend four hours turning it into a life-related sermon and that's usually on the Friday before.\u00a0 And then on Saturday, I spend another six hours on it just trying to make it shorter, because it's always too long and so I make it shorter, make it shorter, make it shorter, make it shorter.\u00a0\nSo I spend about 14 to 16 hours a week writing a sermon and I spend all day preaching it because I speak four times on a Sunday.\u00a0 And so I actually put in about 25 hours a week into producing and delivering one public speaking presentation before I do anything else in my job.\n\u00a0\nRecorded on: Dec 8, 2008.", "title": "Tim Keller on Writing a Sermon", "publishedDate": "2012-04-24T01:41:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lUWE-ir4ao", "description": "\u55b2\u5404\u4f4d\u5c0f\u76d2\u5b50\u5011ww\n\u662f\u6211\u6afb\u96ea\u5566Y(^w^)Y\n\u4eca\u5929\u6211\u5be6\u6cc1\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u3010Enlarged Grass Block Survival\u3011 0w0\n\u9019\u662f\u500b\u8d85\u77ed\u7684\u9810\u544a\u7247\u5462XDDD\n\u65b0\u7684\u5192\u96aa\u5373\u5c07\u958b\u59cbww\n=====================================\n\u5c0d\u4e86\u9019\u662f\u6211\u5011\u5718\u968a\u7684FB\u5c08\u9801ww\n\u5927\u5bb6\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u53bb\u770b\u770b\u54e6\u03c3`\u2200\u00b4)\u03c3\nFB\u5c08\u9801:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/luckyboxlive\n\u9084\u6709\u6afb\u96ea\u6211\u7684\u500b\u4ebaFB\u5c08\u9801ww\n\u6b61\u8fce\u4f86\u9a37\u64fe_(:3 \u300d\u2220 )_(X\nFB\u5c08\u9801:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/YingXueFenSiTuan\n\u97f3\u6a02\ud83c\udfb5:Music - A Carefree Cadence | AudioJungle\nBGM from \u3053\u3093\u3068\u3069\u3045\u3075\u3047 HiLi\nURL\uff1ahttp://conte-de-fees.com/\n\u904a\u6232:\u7576\u500b\u5275\u4e16\u795e- Enlarged Grass Block Survival\n\u5730\u5716:http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/enlarged-grass-block-survival/\n\u5f8c\u7f6e\u8edf\u4ef6:Final Cut pro", "title": "\u3010\u7576\u500b\u5275\u4e16\u795e- Enlarged Grass Block Survival\u3011No.0\u65b0\u7684\u5192\u96aa", "publishedDate": "2014-09-28T20:07:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lUe2MFhetM", "description": "A continuaci\u00f3n te ense\u00f1amos a escribir la arroba. \u00a1Es muy sencillo!\n\nhttp://www.comoseescribe.es/arroba\nhttp://www.comoseescribe.es", "title": "\u00bfC\u00f3mo se escribe la @ (arroba)?", "publishedDate": "2013-07-01T15:37:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lUorkYsp1w", "description": "This is from their ALIVE JAPANESE VERSION.\nCopyright\u24d22012 YG Entertainment Inc. \nLyrics by SUNNY BOY\nComposed by G-DRAGON,SEUNG CHUN HAM,WOOK JIN KANG\n\nVtransed, subbed by ME\nKara effect written by DIANGUCMAU", "title": "[Vietsub + Kara] Ego - Big Bang", "publishedDate": "2012-03-28T17:30:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lV_4FVSYnc", "description": "Finale  of the fashion show during Inabanga's Raffia Festival 2009 (june 27, 2009) showcasing the  various products (accessories, bags, gowns & barongs) of  loomweavers of Inabanga, Bohol in collaboration with reknowned fashion designer Salvador Malto.

For a function with an even root we set the radicand greater than or equal to zero and solve for x. I show how to solve math problems online during live instruction in class.

Exploring the territory between pop music and something all together more strange. Heartbreak is a dark, bittersweet, danceable track.\n\nWith a percussive Prince-like drum sound and skittering analogue synthesizers that fizz into forlorn, melodic vocals, Heartbreak is an after-dark hymn to a long-dead love affair. The song takes it's inspiration from the death of loved ones and reimagines the loss as the harrowing end of a relationship.\n\nDrawing upon a passion for brooding electronic music such as Fever Ray and Soft Cell, Age of Consent produced this single along with previous collaborator/producer Luke Smith who has previously worked with Depeche Mode and Foals. Including on the B-Side their metronomic cover version of Suicide's 'Ghost Rider', which has become something of a live favourite.\n\nDirected by Gareth Phillips (Cat's Eyes, Is Tropical) and the band themselves, the video is partly inspired by Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies, and his idea of setting specific limitations before starting creative work. The band eschewed post-production techniques and only shot effects that could be achieved live. Using a series of projectors connected to cameras filming their own output, they created an intense succession of visual feedback, in some ways indebted to Henri-Georges Clouzot's film 'La Prisonierre' as well as a tongue in cheek nod to Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart.\n\nAge of Consent are Joe Reeves and Darren Cullen. After meeting at Glasgow School of Art they moved to London to make music and produce remixes for the likes of La Roux, Gary Numan and The Toxic Avenger. Their first single 'The Beach' was released in late 2011.\n\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/ageofconsent\nhttp://www.twitter.com/age_of_consent", "title": "Age of Consent - Heartbreak", "publishedDate": "2012-04-16T01:45:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lpK2v_kitA", "description": "In this video, Bobby Wiggins, Narconon Drug Prevention Specialist, explains in simple language what are the long term effects of weed? \n\nYou can find more information about marijuana use and addiction at http://www.narconon.org/", "title": "What are the long term effects of weed? | Marijuana Use", "publishedDate": "2011-01-05T01:37:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5lpeEe_sJBg", "description": "Probablement la montana la plus connue.\nFloraison abondante au l\u00e9ger parfum de vanille.

Absolutely at the peak of her performance ... Joanna Trollope has another bestseller on her hands,\" says reviewer Doris Mousdale. \n\nSynopsis\n\nRachel has always loved being at the centre of her large family. She has fiercely devoted herself to her three sons all their lives,and continues to do so even now they are all grown up. They are, of course, devoted to her -- she and Anthony, their father, hold the family together at their big, beautiful, ramshackle house near the wide, bird-haunted coast of Suffolk.\n\nBut when Luke, her youngest, gets married, Rachel finds that control is slipping away. Other people seem to be becoming more important to her children than she is, and she can no longer rely on her role as undisputed matriarch. A power struggle develops which can only end in unhappiness; her three daughters-in-law want to do things their own way, and so, to her grief, do her sons...\n\nReviewed by Dopris Mousdale, Arcadia Bookshop, Newmarket, Auckland. www.arcadiabookshop.co.nz\n\nReview produced by BookTV.nz, http://booktv.co.nz.

If I just tried repeatedly to jump back from the posture sometimes my wrists would hurt so I found this fun easy way to build the core strength that it takes to do the movement. It's totally safe for everyone to try and there is no pressure on the wrists at all. Even if you don't do yoga this movement helps strengthen the core and build hip flexibility.

Turtle may refer to the chelonian order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling chelonians (British English).\n\nThe order Chelonii or Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known turtles date from 220 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards, snakes or crocodiles. Of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered.\n\nTurtles are ectotherms\u2014their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called cold-blooded. However, because of their high metabolic rate, leatherback sea turtles have a body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the surrounding water.\n\nTurtles are classified as amniotes, along with other reptiles (including birds) and mammals. Like other amniotes, turtles breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.\n\nThe largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), which reaches a shell length of 200 cm (6.6 ft) and can reach a weight of over 900 kg (2,000 lb). Freshwater turtles are generally smaller, but with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii, a few individuals have been reported up to 200 cm (6.6 ft). This dwarfs even the better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America, which attains a shell length of up to 80 cm (2.6 ft) and weighs as much as 113.4 kg (250 lb). Giant tortoises of the genera Geochelone, Meiolania, and others were relatively widely distributed around the world into prehistoric times, and are known to have existed in North and South America, Australia, and Africa. They became extinct at the same time as the appearance of man, and it is assumed humans hunted them for food. The only surviving giant tortoises are on the Seychelles and Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, and can grow to over 130 cm (51 in) in length, and weigh about 300 kg (660 lb).\n\nThe largest ever chelonian was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle known to have been up to 4.6 m (15 ft) long.\n\nThe smallest turtle is the speckled padloper tortoise of South Africa. It measures no more than 8 cm (3.1 in) in length and weighs about 140 g (4.9 oz). Two other species of small turtles are the American mud turtles and musk turtles that live in an area that ranges from Canada to South America. The shell length of many species in this group is less than 13 cm (5.1 in) in length.", "title": "Turtle", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T04:08:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "5m214yW7nug", "description": "Video by Zelmari Degenaar & Carol Groenewald\nSound by Dawid de Villiers & Gerhardt Claassen", "title": "A SUGAR VINYL SESSION feat.

Flocks of these birds are found in grasslands, cultivated areas, scrub and secondary growth and they are best known for their hanging retort shaped nests woven from leaves. These nest colonies are usually found on thorny trees or palm fronds and the nests are often built near water or hanging over water where predators cannot reach easily. They are widespread and common within their range but are prone to local, seasonal movements mainly in response to rain and food availability.\n\nMale of race philippinus displaying at nest\nMale of burmanicus race with the bright yellow crown\n\nAmong the population variations, three subspecies are recognized. The nominate race philippinus is found through much of mainland India while burmanicus is found eastwards into Southeast Asia.

Nearly 170 hectares were declared a Reserved Forest in 1915.

The area is bounded clockwise by JNU (Nelson Mandela Marg), the Mehrauli - Mahipalpur road, NH-8 and the Palam road and the southern boundary of Vasant Vihar. The landscape is undulating with gentle slopes and dotted with numerous morrum and clay mined pits of different sizes, depths and shapes. \nOne can approach to the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, at present, either from Vasant Vihar- Poorvi Marg gate located at about 4 km south west of Moti Bagh, and 2 km west of Jawahar Lal Nehru University (Munirka) or from the Vasant Kunj Institutional gate which is about 3.5 km north of Mahipalpur and one km west of Vasant Kunj Malls.\n\nSource: 1.Toxics Link  \n              2.Bio-diversity Parks owned by DDA\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

It is uncommon in much of its range, and listed as Vulnerable by IUCN because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% over the last three decades. Thomas Stamford Raffles first described a specimen from Malacca where it is called binturung. In standard Malay, it is known as benturung, and in Riau, Indonesia as tenturun.\n\nThe binturong is a monotypic genus. Its genus name Arctictis means \u2018bear-weasel\u2019, from Greek arkt- \u2018bear\u2019 + iktis \u2018weasel\u2019.\n\nThe body of the binturong is long and heavy, and low on the legs. It has a thick fur of strong black hair. The bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root, gradually diminishing in size to the extremity, where it curls inwards. The muzzle is short and pointed, somewhat turned up at the nose, and is covered with bristly hairs, brown at the points, which lengthen as they diverge, and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face. The eyes are large, black and prominent. The ears are short, rounded, edged with white, and terminated by tufts of black hair. There are six short rounded incisors in each jaw, two canines, which are long and sharp, and six molars on each side. The hair on the legs is short and of a brownish tinge. The feet are five-toed, with large strong claws; the soles are bare, and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length; the hind ones are longer than the fore.\n\nBinturongs occur from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan in China, and from Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java in Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), Freedonia's principal benefactress, will lend the country 20 million dollars if the president withdraws and places the government in the hands of the \"fearless, progressive\" Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). At his inauguration, Firefly shows up late, insults everyone in sight, and sings a song about how he intends to abuse his power. Naturally, the crowd cheers wildly. Meanwhile, Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) of neighboring Sylvania schemes to oust Firefly and take over Freedonia himself. To gather enough evidence to discredit Firefly, he sends his most trusted spies, Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx). Five minutes after they show up in Freedonia, both spies become important members of Firefly's cabinet, though Chicolini keeps his day job as a peanut vendor. Firefly eventually declares war on Sylvania, an absurd farrago with Firefly changing uniforms from scene to scene, Chicolini going to the other side because the food is better, and Pinky parading around the battlefield with a sandwich board reading \"Join the army and see the navy.\"\n\n\"duck soup\",\"duck soup clip\",\"duck soup marx brothers\",\"duck soup part 1\",\"duck soup mirror scene\",\"groucho marx\",\"harpo marx\",\"chico marx\",\"zeppo marx\",\"leo mccarey\",\"drum videos\",\"horse videos\",\"scissors videos\",\"classic comedies\",classics,\"political comedies\",\"herman j mankiewicz\",\"creativity videos\",\"happiness videos\",\"teamwork videos\",\"capitol videos\",pinky,\"rufus t firefly\",chicolini,\"lt bob roland\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++14904,/m/01wj9yk,/m/01wj9y9,/m/0139xn,/m/0183tt", "title": "Duck Soup (10/10) Movie CLIP - To War (1933) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-28T21:27:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mEwVO6lj2I", "description": "Max Jury performing 'All I Want' at St. Pancras Old Church in London on October 10th, 2014. \nDownload 'All I Want: The Sonic Factory Sessions' here: http://po.st/MaxJuryAIW\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/maxwelljury\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jaxmury\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/maxwelljury\n\nVideo by Fany de la Chica - www.fanydelachica.co.uk", "title": "Max Jury - All I Want (Acoustic)", "publishedDate": "2014-10-17T09:14:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mFI9S9VKnU", "description": "Hidden Camera Comedy Show\n\nSubscribe for Updates - http://goo.gl/on2M5R\nShort Films - http://goo.gl/Sa6jhA\nFull Length Movies - http://goo.gl/m8ls2H\nDaily Schedule - http://goo.gl/aO58iB\nSpoof Videos - http://goo.gl/RgyyUV\nComedy - http://goo.gl/h4R3JK and http://goo.gl/bzF2Tf\nVideo Songs Juke Box - http://goo.gl/1EplqA\nKids Videos - http://goo.gl/QceIoa\nRadio - http://goo.gl/W6WXGI\nDevotional - http://goo.gl/Y2OsqS\n\nMr Jaffa, Mr Jaffa Comedy Show, Mr Jaffa Telugu Comedy Show, Mr Jaffa TV Show, Hidden Camera Comedy Show, Just For Laughs, comedy shows in telugu channels, comedy shows in telugu, comedy in public place, funny videos, comedy express,", "title": "Mr JAFFA || Hidden Camera Comedy Show || Episode 06", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T08:52:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mFflhnhWtw", "description": "http://www.baby-backpacks.org.uk/bushbaby-premiere", "title": "bushbaby premier review", "publishedDate": "2011-06-19T18:34:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mFjNhHsETY", "description": "California Prionus Beetle - Found this guy on my truck windshield.

Since the systems you buy at the garden centers go for $25 - $60, this saves you a TON and you can garden anywhere where you have good light.\n\nTips not on the video:\n\n1.

Until the introduction of the nickel-cadmium battery and lithium-containing batteries, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide, because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide has seen widemercial use as the chief cathodic material formercial disposable dry cells and dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.[18]\n\n Historically, manganese is named for various black minerals (such as pyrolusite) from the same region of Magnesia in Greece which gave names to similar-sounding magnesium, Mg, and magnetite, an ore of the element iron, Fe. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in , by reducing the dioxide with carbon.\n\n Groote Eylandt is Aboriginal land that covers an area of approximately  square kilometres, located in the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory of Australia.\n\n Manganese is the twelfth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is found in many minerals with the two main manganese minerals being pyrolusite (MnO2) and rhodochrosite (MnCO3). Manganese is essential to iron and steel making because of its sulphur fixing, deoxidising and alloying properties as well as its low cost. About 90 per cent of manganese production is used in manufacturing iron and steel, but it also is important for use in dry cell batteries, as an alloying element in aluminium and copper and trace nutrient in plant fertilisers and animal feeds as well as in the form of manganesepounds as pigments and for colouring ceramics and glass. Properties and uses of manganese can be found on the International Manganese Institute website.", "title": "manganese mines australia", "publishedDate": "2012-09-18T13:12:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mOeWV_vq20", "description": "Vellangkanni Chitapa going to Tokyo .", "title": "Tsuga", "publishedDate": "2010-12-21T09:27:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mP1dATrFpg", "description": "", "title": "mu\u011flahacamat hacamatc\u0131 ve  Hirudo cinsi t\u0131bb\u0131 s\u00fcl\u00fck temin edilir 0 533 627 72 58", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T03:14:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mPH0ByI2Lk", "description": "This is me catching a trumpet fish.", "title": "Trumpet fish", "publishedDate": "2012-01-24T21:46:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mPNJalTg58", "description": "I usually wash my hair, when it's in a protective style, every 2 weeks.

The great majority of Turks hold Kemalist ideas, are enlightened and progressive, enjoy freedoms, and advocate a modern Islam, the Islam of the time of the Companions. All our young people are modern. It is therefore impossible to implement a fanatical and conservative conception of Islam in Turkey. \n\nSecond, Tayyip Erdo\u011fan shows in person, through his own life, that he is against a fanatical conception of Islam. His wife is also a modern person. He may be behaving in this way because of pressure from the fanatics. Otherwise, he is someone open to freedom. He is someone who wants a lively and vibrant life. He makes sure all the means made available by science are used. All the facilities he opens are ultramodern. He wants science and technology to develop as fully as possible. He hands tablet computers out, for instance. He has said that 10 million more will be given out. How can someone who does these things espouse a fanatical, conservative conception of Islam? There is no such thing in actual practice. Nobody in Turkey would accept such a thing, either. The prime minister would never desire such a thing, and the Turkish people would never accept it. We need a sensitivity that is always opposed to fanaticism.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Pitt vs Boston College | 2014 ACC Football Highlights", "publishedDate": "2014-09-06T03:37:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mjJa8kLlm8", "description": "Le jury du prix Rustica 2014 De la Terre \u00e0 la Table a retenu le confit de melon des Zap\u00e9ros d\u2019Ann-Zo parmi les nombreux produits de terroir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la f\u00eate des plantes d\u2019automne de Saint-Jean-de-Beauregard (91).\n\nRetrouvez la suite du reportage sur notre site : \n- Les gagnants du prix Rustica De la Terre \u00e0 la Table 2014\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/articles-jardin/fruits-et-verger/gagnants-prix-rustica-terre-a-table-2014,8394.html\n- Des cerisiers en espalier\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/videos-jardin/fruits-et-verger/cerisiers-espalier,8388.html\n- Des raisins au go\u00fbt de poire\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/videos-jardin/arbres-et-arbustes/raisins-gout-poire,8393.html\nUn figuier pour toutes les r\u00e9gions\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/videos-jardin/fruits-et-verger/figuier-pour-toutes-regions,8390.html\nLe piment de Bresse\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/videos-jardin/legumes-et-potager/piment-bresse,8392.html\nDes confits aux l\u00e9gumes pour l'ap\u00e9ritif\nhttp://www.rustica.fr/videos-jardin/legumes-et-potager/confits-aux-legumes-pour-l-aperitif,8389.html", "title": "Des confits aux l\u00e9gumes pour l'ap\u00e9ritif", "publishedDate": "2014-10-07T04:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "5mjf30jKKpw", "description": "Important:- As per a report of the Interior Ministry of Pakistan, it was conveyed that thousands of innocent Pakistanis have been killed and more than thousand injured in bloody incidents of terrorism across Pakistan, targeting mosques with the help of suicide bombers as well as explosive-laden vehicles.

Have fun with your braces and give us a call at 303-627-6212 or visit our website http://www.garlockortho.com to schedule your appointment today!\n\n\nHi my name is Dr. David Garlock. I'm owner and orthodontist at Garlock Orthodontics here in Aurora, Colorado. It's a new year, it's January 2014 and with the new year here at Garlock Orthodontics we're offering a special on Wild Smiles. What Wild Smiles is, they're specialized brackets mostly for young kids, but, they range in shapes from hearts to stars, to Superman shields and footballs. What we're doing, what I've noticed, is a lot of kids want Wild Smiles, but there's an additional cost associated with getting those brackets. So, we're waiving that fee in the month of January and kids can get the Wild Smile brackets for free, if they're a candidate for braces. Not every kid needs braces, but some kids do, to help make sure they don't harm their teeth or if their bite is off. So come on in to our office for a free consultation and I'll take a look, set aside time in my schedule to do a quick examination. We can talk about your options, if anything, put your mind at peace that your child doesn't need treatment. So come in and visit us today for a free consultation. You can look us up on the web at http://www.garlockortho.com or give us a call at 303-627-6212. We look forward to meeting you.

O que ocorreu* Os porcos ficaram magros! Por isso o \u00f3rg\u00e3o sugeriu alimentar com soja e milho. Para alegria dos cuidadores de porcos, os mesmos come\u00e7aram a engordar.\nTempos depois uma s\u00e9rie de fatores incentivou o desuso do \u00f3leo de coco, como artigos cient\u00edficos que identificaram as gorduras saturadas como um agente causador de doen\u00e7as cardiovasculares (o \u00f3leo de coco \u00e9 uma gordura saturada). M\u00e9dicos e nutricionistas aboliram o ovo, as carnes e os \u00f3leos com gordura saturada da alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o das pessoas, incentivando-as a utilizarem \u00f3leos polinsaturados como o de soja, algod\u00e3o, milho, canola, etc. Houve um impacto comercial e estas gorduras quase desapareceram do mercado. Explodiu o consumo de \u00f3leos vegetais refinados. Todavia, h\u00e1 menos de 10 anos, constatou-se que 75% das gorduras que obstruem as art\u00e9rias, s\u00e3o provenientes das gorduras vegetais polinsaturadas e, n\u00e3o das gorduras saturadas. \nO \u00f3leo de coco \u00e9 um produto natural extra\u00eddo do leite de coco (Cocos nuc\u00edfera) prensado a frio.

The plant is a forest wild flower found in North America and called the Bunchberry dogwood.\n\nA few botanists had noted a strange \"poof\" associated with the plant, but no one knew what was going on. Researchers at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, were studying the plant when they experienced the \"poof.\" Wanting to track down what the plant was doing, they got a high-speed video camera that can shoot 1,000 frames per second. Amazingly, that camera was too slow to clearly catch what the plant was doing. So they got a higher-speed camera that could shoot 10,000 frames per second. \n\nWhen they reviewed the video, they discovered that the flower was releasing pollen at an amazing speed. They calculated that the gravitational force on the pollen as it is released is 800 times the force astronauts endure when they blast into space. This wonder is accomplished by the flowers' very elastic petals which are part of a design that looks like a trebuchet -- a medieval catapult.\n\nThe amazing wonders of God's creation should lead us to unceasingly praise Him, something which belief in evolution does not allow. Even if you try to add God to evolution, chance and natural forces still get the credit.\n\nPrayer: \nI praise You, Father, for all the wonders of Your creation. Help my life praise you before others as well. Amen.\n\n Notes: \nScience News, 6/11/05, p. 381, \"World's Fastest Plant Explodes with Pollen.\"", "title": "Fastest Flower in the West", "publishedDate": "2012-02-26T13:00:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "5ms5J7EVaV4", "description": "Buy it here; http://www.wholelattelove.com/Krups/krups-fl700d51-electric-glass-carafe-tea-maker.cfm\n\nThe Krups FL700D51 Electronic Tea Maker is a marriage of electronic technology and a proven time-honored tea making process.

The Jade Vine (Strongylodon macrobotrys) is one of the most prized treasures of the Phillippine rain forest. Sadly it's also one of the most threated by the deforestation taking place there. This rare and endgangered plant represents a fascinating story of pollination. In the wild the Jade Vine is pollinated by bats but, as we don't have bats flying around the Biomes at the Eden Project in Cornwall, Rainforest supervisor John Nichol mimics their action with his hands. He explains, \"In the wild, as the bat hangs upside down to drink nectar from the the flower, another part of the flower deposits pollen on the back of its head. As it moves on, that pollen is deposited on the femail part of the next flower and pollination occurs. This is one of the novel feats of nature.\" The jade vine is a member of the same family as peas and beans. Its tangled woody branches grow flower spikes known as racemes and it's from these that the gorgeous aquamarine flowers bloom. It is a climbing plant that grows up through the forest canopy to reach the light.\n\nMore at www.edenproject.com\n\nDate: March 2009", "title": "Eden Project's rare vine in rainforest biome", "publishedDate": "2009-03-25T19:01:24.000Z"}]
