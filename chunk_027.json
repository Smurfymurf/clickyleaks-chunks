The body is brown on top and reddish underneath in breeding plumage. The tail has a black and white barred pattern. The winter plumage is largely grey.\n\nTheir breeding habitat is grassy wetlands in inland northern Asia. They migrate to southeast Asia as far south as northern Australia, although both the breeding and wintering areas are poorly known. This bird is always found on coasts during migration and wintering.\n\nThese birds forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud. They mainly eat insects, mollusks, crustaceans and marine worms, but also eat some plant material.\n\nThe confusion species for this bird is not, as might be expected, one of the American dowitchers, which in any case do not overlap in range, because the Asian bird is much larger. It closely resembles a small Bar-tailed Godwit, although the dowitcher \"sewing machine\" feeding action and the yelping call are distinctions from the more widespread bird.\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

That the composer had the same name as at least three other men from the area around Li\u00e8ge has created much confusion about the biography of the composer. A Johannes Ciconia, probably the composer's father, was probably born around 1335, and worked in Avignon in 1350 as a clerk for the wife of the nephew of Pope Clement VI.\n\nA second person by the name of Johannes Ciconia appears in records in Li\u00e8ge in 1385 as a duodenus, generally a person of young age; thus contemporary scholars are in agreement that this is the composer himself. Papal records suggest that this Ciconia was in the service of Pope Boniface IX in Rome in 1391. His whereabouts between the early 1390s and 1401 are unknown. From this time until his death in 1412, he remained connected to the cathedral of Padua. It is unclear whether he arrived in Padua earlier than 1401. If his lament, Con lagrime bagnadome, described in one text source as written for the death of Francesco of Carrara, were written for Francesco il Nuovo, then it would date from after 1406; if, as earlier scholars had assumed, it were written for the death of Francesco il Vecchio, then he would have needed to be in Padua by 1393. The possibility of an intermediate stay in Pavia has also been suggested by N\u00e1das and Ziino, as a necessary place for him to pick up Visconti associations and to learned the ars subtilior style and compositions of Philipoctus de Caserta quoted in his Sus un fontayne.\n\nCiconia's music has evidenced a comparable commingling of styles. Music typical of northern Italy, such as his madrigal Una panthera, is combined with the French ars nova. The more complex ars subtilior style surfaces in one work noted above, and the late Medieval style begins to morph into writing which points towards the melodic patterning of the Renaissance, for instance in his setting of O rosa bella. He wrote music both secular (French virelais, Italian ballate and madrigals) and sacred (motets, mass movements, some of them isorhythmic). He is also the author of two treatises on music, the Nova Musica, and De Proportionibus (which is an extract and expansion of some ideas from Nova Musica). His music-theoretical ideas stem from the more conservative Marchettian tradition, and can be contrasted with those of his Paduan contemporary Prosdocimus de Beldemandis.\n\nThough contrafacts and later sources of his compositions suggest that he was well-known in Florence, his music is scarcely represented in the large Florentine sources; for instance there is no section for his works in the Squarcialupi Codex.", "title": "Johannes Ciconia - Latin Ballads (1/5) Albane misse celitus", "publishedDate": "2010-01-18T00:14:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dCWg4eRoTc", "description": "Website: http://socialmedianz.posterous.com\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/socialmedia_nz\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/socialmedianz\n\n10/01/2010\n\nWelcome to our NEW weekly Social Media and Tech Roundup show - where we take the hottest news of the week from social media and tech and compress it in a  easily digestible 3-4 minute segment for you :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Google Nexus One\" - http://ow.ly/ULYe   | Google Nexus One Web Store - http://google.com/phone\n\n\"CES 2010\" - http://ow.ly/ULWx \n\n\"Amazon Kindle DX Goes International\" - http://ow.ly/ULW8 \n\n\"AOL In talks with Mashable of a Possible Acquisition\" - http://ow.ly/ULVU and http://ow.ly/ULW1 \n\n\n\n*This is my first video - so excuse the staleness, i will get better promise :) \n\n\nJohn\n\nSocial Media NZ", "title": "Social Media NZ: 10/01/2010 Social Media and Tech Round-up Ep1", "publishedDate": "2010-01-10T14:23:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dDBesAMaJw", "description": "Z alba \"Don\u00b4t worry be punk\", http://www.visiondays.cz/\nN\u00e1m\u011bt: IAn,  Re\u017eie: P\u00e1ja Junek\nhttp://www.junekfilm.cz\n\u00a9 2013", "title": "Vision Days - Cesta do hlubin punk\u00e1\u010dovy du\u0161e  (Official Music Video 2013)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-07T16:51:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dDLZgh-CY4", "description": "561-868-1700 Call RCI Recruitment Solutions for moreThis position has been filled, search for more active Machine Shop jobs http://www.bestactivejobsusa.com/", "title": "Tool and Die Maker Jobs", "publishedDate": "2011-07-18T12:07:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dDYa7_FuY0", "description": "The Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) Kingdom: Animalia    Phylum: Chordata    Class: Aves (Birds)    Order: Falconiformes    Family: Falconidae .Common Kestrel is a widespread winter visitor and local resident in India. Kestrels are diurnal and prefer an \"open country\" habitat found in fields, heaths, and marshland. When hunting, the Kestrel hovers, almost stationary, about 10-20 m above the ground searching for prey. Once prey is sighted, the Kestrel makes a short, steep dive toward the target.Size: 33-35 cm.   Wingspan: 72-80 cm   Weight: 160-240 gm   Call: shrill 'kee-kee-kee'. Identification: Brick red above with grey head; light buff below with brown spearhead spots. In flight pointed black wings and rounded grey tail with broad black terminal band can be seen. Male has a dark moustachial stripe. Females and juveniles have rufous crown and nape streaked with black.In the cool-temperate parts of its range, the Common Kestrel migrates south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a diurnal animal of the lowlands and prefers open habitat such as fields, heaths, shrubland and marshland. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternate perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless steppe where there are abundant herbaceous plants and shrubs to support a population of prey animals. The Common Kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in wetlands, moorlands and arid savanna. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to 4,500 m (15,000 ft) When hunting, the Common Kestrel characteristically hovers about 10--20 m (c.30--70 ft) above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using ridge lift. Like most birds of prey, Common Kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target. It can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. This species is able to see near ultraviolet light, allowing the birds to detect the urine trails around rodent burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight.[7] Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the birds spot prey animals moving by, they will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.The Common Kestrel starts breeding in spring (or the start of the dry season in the tropics), i.e. April/May in temperate Eurasia and some time between August and December in the tropics and southern Africa. It is a cavity nester, preferring holes in cliffs, trees or buildings; in built-up areas, Common Kestrels will often nest on buildings,The clutch is normally 3-6 eggs, but may contain any number of eggs up to seven; even more eggs may be laid in total when some are removed during the laying time, which lasts about 2 days per egg laid.Data from Britain shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2-3 chicks on average,The biological lifespan to death from senescence can be 16 years or more, however; one was recorded to have lived almost 24 years.", "title": "Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) Small Bird Of Prey by Shirishkumar Patil", "publishedDate": "2013-06-05T15:06:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dE4Z7ZqtNw", "description": "Nextel, la mayorista n\u00famero 1 en Salud y Belleza\nBalnearios Nextel: Hotel Termes Montbri\u00f3 ****Q (Tarragona)\n\nEste complejo Hotel Resort Spa & Park, situado a tan solo 6 km. de la playa, junto a Salou, Cambrils y Miami Playa, y a 20 min. de la estaci\u00f3n del AVE.

Shawn is a Vocal Performance Major at Northwestern College in St. Paul, MN.\n\nwww.shawnpatrickfletcher.com\n\nGabriel Faur\u00e9 (1845-1924) was born in Pamiers, France, the youngest of six children in a non-musical family.  Although his parents realized he was a gifted pianist they sent Faur\u00e9 to a regular school until one of his professors heard him playing and suggested he be sent to the Niedermeyer School of religious music in Paris. Here Faur\u00e9 studied many compositional styles while focusing on organ and piano performance, greatly excelling at the latter.  Most of Faur\u00e9's early compositions, until 1871, hint at some his originality as a composer, but they mostly fit the characteristics of his classical training.  In his later music however Faur\u00e9 used more of his own personal style to convey the meaning behind the poetry, giving the listener more emotion than the text alone could convey. Faur\u00e9 used his accompaniment to portray the subtext, giving his songs more depth, emotion and beauty.\n\nNell, however, is a wonderful example of Faur\u00e9's later compositional style. It displays Faur\u00e9's ability to provide subtext to a song through the piano accompaniment.  In Nell Faur\u00e9 took a mostly strophic vocal part and gave each stanza a different subtext.  This melody opens with a prayer-like solemnity, an earnest expression of love and devotion.  Then, in the third stanza Faur\u00e9 uses multiple modulations to express more fervency and desperation.  Finally, he returns to the opening melody to express the eternal and undying love that will last longer than the song of the sea.\n\nNell\n\nTa rose de pourpre \u00e0 ton \n   clair soleil,\nO Juin, \u00e9tincelle enivree,\nPenche aussi vers moi \n   ta coupe dor\u00e9e:\nMon coeur \u00e0 ta rose est pareil.\n\nSous le mol abri \n   de la feuille ombreuse\nMonte soupir de volupt\u00e9;\nPlus d'un ramier chante \n   au bois \u00e9cart\u00e9,\nO mon coeur, \n   sa plainte amoureuse.\n\nQue ta perle est douce \n   au cial enflame,\nEtoile de la nuit pensive!\nMais combine plus douce \n   est la claret vive\nQui rayonne en mon coeur, \n   en mon coeur charm\u00e9!\n\nLa chantante mer, le long du rivage,\nTaira son \n   murmure \u00e9ternal,\nAvant qu'en mon coeur, \n   ch\u00e8re amour, \u00f4 Nell,\nNe fleurisse plus ton image!\n\nPoem by Leconte de Lisle\n\nNell\n\nYour purple rose in your \n   brilliant sun,\nOh June, sparkles as if intoxicated,\nBend toward me, too, \n   your golden cup:\nMy heart and your rose are alike.\n\nUnder the soft shelter \n   of the shady boughs\nSounds a voluptuous sigh;\nAnd turtle doves coo \n   in the spreading wood,\nOh my heart, \n   their amorous lament.\n\nHow sweet is your pearl \n   in the flaming sky, \nStar of the pensive night!\nBut sweeter still \n   is the vivid light\nWhich shines in my heart, \n   my charmed heart!\n\nThe singing sea, along the shore,\nWill silence its \n   everlasting murmur,\n'Ere in my heart, \n   dear love, oh Nell,\nYour image, will cease to bloom.\n\nTranslation by Sergius Kagen", "title": "Nell - Shawn Patrick Fletcher", "publishedDate": "2011-05-10T00:32:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "0dZqKAdAVC4", "description": "O lule lule...malli i zjarrte i nje njeriu per vendlindjen", "title": "Kenge Arbereshe - O lule lule", "publishedDate": "2011-03-03T23:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "0d_0O7jzK8c", "description": "Insecto ben\u00e9fico pero feo", "title": "Amblipigio", "publishedDate": "2012-02-26T00:51:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0da5ug18tkU", "description": "See how easy it is to personalize and send a card from your computer!

We provide our customers complete crushing plant, including cone crusher, jaw crusher, impact crusher, VSI sand making machine, mobile crusher and vibrating screen. What we provide is not just the high value-added products, but also the first class service team and problems solution suggestions. \n\nOur products can be used in the crushing of non- metallic and non flammable materials whose humidity less than 6% and Moh's hardness less than 9, such as calcite, chalk, calcium carbonate, dolomite, kaolin, bentonite, talcum, mica, magnesite, illite, pyrophyllite, vermiculite, sepiolite, attapulgite, rectorite, kieselguhr, barite, gypsum, alunite, graphite, fluorite, phosphate ore, potassium ore, pumice etc.\n\nVSI Sand Making Machine\n\u3010Capacity\u3011:80T/H\nShunky VSI Crusher (Sand-Making Machine) is one of the most advanced sand-making equipments in the world and is further improved after introducing German Bamaque technology. Shunky VSI Crusher is especially \n\nsuitable for sand making and stone reshaping and is generally used in third crushing. It is a perfect combination of unique rotor structure design, wear-resisting technology, crushing speed optimization and hydraulic \n\ndesign. It provides high quality aggregate for highway, high-speed railway, high buildings, municipal construction, hydroelectric dam construction and mixing station.\n\n1.Large processing capacity and perfect productivity of ideal output: 50-500 t/h, output increases by 30% compared with the traditional equipment using same power, and VSI sand making machine works more stably.\n2.Low consumption of wearing parts- excellent designed impact angle in crushing chamber reduces the frication between wearing parts and materials, consequently operation cost can be reduced by 30%.\n3.Fine shape of final product- good cubic shape, fineness modulus can be adjusted, especially suitable for artificial sand making and stone reshaping. It is proved that the reshaping achievement increases by 30% \n\ncomparing to other traditional equipments.\n4.Hydraulic drive system is convenient to maintain, hydraulic cover opening device makes it more convenient and easier to replace the wearing parts in crushing cavity and decreases the downtime, thus saves time \n\nand energy.\n5.Automatic monitoring equipment is safe and reliable: Vibrating and alarming device will warn and turn off the crusher to protect it.\n6.Thin oil lubrication and automatic maintenance: thin oil lubricating station from German makes sure the supply of the oil with double oil pumps. The machine can stop working without oil or hydraulic pressure. Heating \n\nand cooling oil device assures the bearing's lubrication is at its best. The bearing over-heat protective function makes the main bearing keep in a constant temperature and have a long service life.\n7.Simple installation and easy operation: it is light in weight and has diverse means to install. It is very easy to install, maintain, use and repair. When the concrete purpose is set, it just needs tiny adjustments to make \n\nfull use of it.\n8.Multi-purpose machine, flexible application: unique crushing structure together with wide ranges of crushing chambers can make stone hits stone and stone hits iron simultaneously. If we have different purposes, we \n\njust need to adjust a few parts; we could use it for artificial sand, sand reshaping etc.\n9.International quality guarantee: it adopts German advanced technology, advanced riveting technology, abrasive blasting, rust removal and spray paint in automobile making, which greatly improves inner and exterior \n\nquality. Moreover, core parts adopt world famous brand (bearing uses the high-accuracy class TIMKEN antifriction bearing) with fewer errors.\n10.Environmental protection: the automatic air circulatory system makes lower noise, less dust. Besides, VSI vertical shaft impact crusher can be installed with kinds of dust-cleaning devices.\n\nFor more details about sand making machine:http://www.sandmaker.biz", "title": "Shanghai Shunky 9526 Sand Making Machine", "publishedDate": "2013-05-06T09:16:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e-tqWgiVsY", "description": "A first video of the new gooseberry board\n\nhttp://gooseberry.atspace.co.uk/", "title": "Gooseberry Board", "publishedDate": "2012-07-25T12:34:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e-wgTJz3Lo", "description": "From Wikipedia:\nThe Pandora sphinx moth (Eumorpha pandorus), also called the Pandorus Sphinx Moth, is a North American moth in the Sphingidae family. It is a large, greenish gray moth with darker patches and pink edges and small pink eyespots. The underside is usually pale yellow-green or brown. It has a wingspan of 3\u00bc--4\u00bd inches (8.2--11.5 cm), females being slightly larger than males. Pandora sphinx moths fly during dusk. Some places see only one generation a year, while others see two.\n\nLife cycle\n\nFemale adults lay translucent eggs singly on leaves of the host plant, mainly Vitis (grapes), and Parthenocissus (Virginia creeper). Caterpillars are large, green or red with a swollen third thorax segment into which the head and first two thoractic segments can be drawn. The abdomen has a small white spot on the second segment, and big white oval spots the last five spiracles. They also have the characteristic \"horn\" at the end of the abdomen, until it is replaced by a button in its last instar. Larvae consume copious amounts of foliage, and when they are ready they climb down their host plant and burrow underground, where they pupate. The pupa is dark brown in color, quite slender, and has a long cremaster. There the pupa will remain for either a couple of weeks or a couple of months, depending on the generation. When the pupa is ready, it wiggles to the surface just prior to eclosion. The newly emerged adults then climb on a plant or some other surface, and pump fluid into their wings to extend them. Females emit pheromones at night, and males fly into the wind to pick up and track the pheromone plume.\n\nFull caterpillar photo: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_x29Pef-T4FQ/TUMQNPO7WQI/AAAAAAAATaQ/bigr-LacM-g/s400/MN09%2Bpandora%2Bsphinx%2Bcaterpillar%2B509_9109.jpg\n\nAdult Photo: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3125/3090301684_fe49dd2a15.jpg", "title": "Pandora Sphinx Moth Caterpillar (Chowing on Virginia Creeper)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T12:06:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e0C0iSgpPQ", "description": "Ever wondered how porcupines do it?", "title": "Porcupines Mating", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T12:33:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e0DB_7MgGc", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Dramamine on a cheap guitar with no fret dots!!", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T23:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e0YMq8xVEg", "description": "Pranks 2014 prank & pranks gone wrong..Bust a Nut in the Hood (pranks gone wrong) -

It looks at ways of removing barriers that restrict life choices for disabled people. When barriers are removed, disabled people can be independent and equal in society, with choice and control over their own lives.\n\nDisabled people developed the social model of disability because the traditional medical model did not explain their personal experience of disability or help to develop more inclusive ways of living.\n\nAn impairment is defined as long-term limitation of a person\u2019s physical, mental or sensory function.\n\nWith thanks to:\nAlice Maynard\nOssie Stuart\nIan Macrae\nMik Scarlet\nLaurence Clark\nKiruna Stammell\nPaul Carter\n\nFor more films from Scope about disability, please subscribe to our YouTube channel:\nhttp://bit.ly/S9YfOM\n\nAbout Scope:\nScope exists to make this country a place where disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else.

His music has been supported by the likes of Solarstone, Jaytech, Ruben De Ronde, and Boom Jinx, and since his first appearance on Silk in 2012, he has only continued to present listeners with unique and uplifting songs. We're extremely proud to present Gregory's debut artist album, \"Impressionism\", on Arrival, featuring 10 inspiring progressive cuts. \n\nThe title track begins with a hypnotic female speech segment, while Gregory's signature arpeggio lines build up in the background. \"On The Horizon\" features unique guitar riffs and gorgeous vocal effects. The break introduces lush piano lines, as well as intricate percussion stems. A splendid atmosphere is quickly established in \"Your Warmth\", the break of which sees the introduction of outstanding synth work and various sound effects. Previously featured as a single on parent label Silk Digital which reached #35 on the Beatport Breaks Top 100 chart, \"Starman\" features a stunning breakbeat and wonderful layered melodies. \"Once More\", featuring Japanese pop singer and song-writer Ai Takekawa, is a blissful song composed of Ai's beautiful vocals and Gregory's unmistakably well-crafted melodies and textures. Starting out with space-inspired radio chatter, \"Call Of Space\" features smooth percussion elements, as well as enjoyable string layers that we witness in the break. \"Drawing The Life\" starts out with a wealth of interesting sound effects and well-crafted female vocal stems. The soundscape slowly evolves, and is beautifully supported by subtle guitar riffs. Ai Takekawa makes her second appearance on this album in \"Monday Night\". The memorable chorus hook is smoothly enhanced by the vast array of unique melodies. Starting out with a tremendous atmosphere with wondrous sound effects, \"Pilgrimage\" features a prominent bassline groove and goose bumps-inducing sounds throughout the entire song. Closing out the album, \"Triumph\" starts with a unique and energetic riff, later accompanied by Gregory's signature guitar riffs and lush female vocal stems.\n\nMastering: Aeron Aether\nDesign: Laurent Sadeg\nA&R: Eliran \"Probity\" Mukdasi\n\n\u25bc Video Credits:\nVideo Editor: Wachterberg (http://bit.ly/SunsetMelodies)\n\n1. \"above\" by Suishu Ikeda (https://vimeo.com/73381838)\n2. \"Glasshouse Mountains, Queensland Australia\" by Aerial Advantage (https://vimeo.com/38078139)\n3. \"Aerial Show Reel 1\" (https://vimeo.com/98233378) and \"Hatteras\" (https://vimeo.com/82305761) by Justin Brown", "title": "Gregory Esayan - Impressionism (Album Teaser)", "publishedDate": "2014-07-30T19:30:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "0e4TLUdvoDk", "description": "The Somali army and the African Union troops have recaptured the port city of Barawe from al-Shabab fighters.\n\nMilitary sources say the fighters fled before the forces reached the city.

This sounds difficult but is actually extremely easy because of the HCG. The HCG helps break down that stubborn abnormal fat and puts into the blood steam. This broken down fat is then used as energy. So even though you are only consuming 500 calories per day on the diet, your body is actually using many more calories from the fat to supply you with the energy you need. In fact, many of Dr. Simeons' patients would sometime complain that 500 calories was too much per day!\n\nThe HCG diet has been tested, proven, and received thousands upon thousands of happy clients who have lost the weight that other \"fad\" diets couldn't get rid of. If you are looking to lose 10 pounds, 40 pounds, or even more, then let a scientifically proven HCG weight loss program help you become a healthier version of yourself!\n\nAbout 50 years ago Dr. Simeons began testing Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG)on overweight and obese patients. He found that by taking HCG, and strict dieting, a person would lose 1 -- 2 pounds per day of abnormal fat which mostly deposits around the hips, thighs, and buttocks. This was the unhealthy fat that builds up and can be very difficult to shed.\n\nDr. Simeons' HCG was originally administered through injections but has recently been developed into HCG drops which can be taken orally. The drops have also passed the test and have proven to be equally as effective in shedding 1 -- 2 pounds of abnormal fat per day.

The festival is celebrated on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight of the month of Bhadra (August-September) in the Hindu calendar. Rasa lila, dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna, are a special feature in regions of Mathura and Vrindavan, and regions following Vaishnavism in Manipur. While the Rasa lila re-creates the flirtatious aspects of Krishna's youthful days, the Dahi Handi celebrate God's playful and mischievous side, where teams of young men form human pyramids to reach a high-hanging pot of butter and break it. This tradition, also known as uriadi, is a major event in Tamil Nadu on Gokulashtami. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and staying up until midnight, the time when Krishna is believed to have been born. Images of Krishna's infancy are placed in swings and cradles in temples and homes. At midnight devotees gather around for devotional songs, dance and exchange gifts. Some temples also conduct reading of the Hindu religious scripture Bhagavad Gita. \n\nVrindavan alternatively spelled as Vrindaban, Brindavan, Brindavana, or Brundavan and also known as Vraj is a town in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is the site of an ancient forest which is the region where according to the Mahabharata, a grand Epic of Sanskrit literature dating back to the 3000BC, the deity Krishna spent his childhood days. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place according to traditions of Hinduism. The major tradition followed in the area is Vaisnavism, and it is a center of learning with many Vrindavan Ashrams operating. It's a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like Govardhana and Gokul that are associated with Krishna. Many millions of bhaktas or devotees of Radha Krishna visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth. \n\nThe town is about 10 km away from Mathura, the city of Lord Krishna's birthplace, near the Agra-Delhi highway. The town hosts hundreds of temples dedicated to the worship of Radha and Krishna and is considered sacred by a number of religious traditions such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Vaishnavism, and Hinduism in general. Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu history, and is an important Hindu pilgrimage site. One of its oldest surviving temples is the Govinda Dev temple, built in 1590, with the town founded earlier in the same century. It is believed that the essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna's transcendent pastimes. Chaitanya wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavana in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, He was able locate all the important places of Krishna's pastimes in and around Vrindavana.\nIn the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanization, first by local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has been eliminated or are close to it. A few peacocks and monkeys can be seen found but cows are now only found in the goshalas of the Major Ashrams of Vrindavan.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of imagery from South Asia.

The production of the film started in 1988 but only concluded at the end of 2011 after two and a half decades of struggle. The most acclaimed Hungarian play was written 150 years ago, it was translated to 90 languages, being constantly compared to Goethe's Faust or Dante's Divina Comedia not only because of its theme but also due to its qualities. The play still lives its life in the European cultural sphere: it has been recently translated to Russian and Italian for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe film follows the structure of the play: it consists of 15 acts that guide us through the past and the future of mankind. The narrative begins with the creation of the world, the first and the last acts frame the story that show us Adam and Eve travelling through space and time in search of the meaning of life -- with the guidance of Lucifer himself. Jankovics drew all the acts in different style making the audience feel that we are watching a monumental encyclopaedia of animation. The first human couple travels from the Paradise through prehistoric times, the ancient Egypt, Hellas, Rome, the medieval Byzantine Empire, Kepler's Prague, the French Revolution to the London of the XIX. century, then Jankovics rushes us through the last 150 years of Europe and we get an insight to the future. The film is a highly dramatised version of the play: while it keeps the philosophical profoundness of Mad\u00e1ch's book it also highlights visually its unique wit and makes Lucifer's fight for the soul of the first man more compelling than ever. \n\nMarcell Jankovics (1941) is a worldwide acclaimed animation filmmaker, he has written, designed and directed several hundred animated shorts: singles and series. The first full-length animated film produced in Hungary -- Johnny Corncob -- is associated with his name.

In Mitteleuropa hat sich der Fenchel in manchen Gebieten aus Kulturen verwildert. Der Wilde Fenchel unterscheidet sich von dem mit ihm verwandten Dill durch die ungefl\u00fcgelten, eif\u00f6rmig-l\u00e4ngliche Fr\u00fcchtchen.  Die Blattscheiden sind beim Wilden Fenchel meist drei bis sechs Zentimeter lang und an der Spitze kapuzenf\u00f6rmig vorgezogen. Die Blattscheiden des Dills sind dagegen meist weniger vorgezogen und nicht l\u00e4nger als zwei Zentimeter.\n\nEs gibt mehrere Arten des Fenchels, die sich im Geschmack der Fr\u00fcchtchen unterscheiden. Fenchel gibt es von aromatisch s\u00fc\u00dflich bis ziemlich scharf. \u00dcberwiegend sind es die Fr\u00fcchte und das aus ihnen gewonnene \u00d6l, die den Fenchel als Gew\u00fcrz- und Heilpflanze interessant machen. Das \u00e4therische \u00d6l des Fenchels enth\u00e4lt als Hauptbestandteil Anethol und wirkt magenst\u00e4rkend, krampfl\u00f6send, appetitanregend und harntreibend. Der kr\u00e4ftige, aromatische Geruch bei allen Arten des Fenchels und seine g\u00fcnstigen Wirkungen auf die Verdauungsorgane machen ihn auch zu einem idealen Speisegew\u00fcrz. Die Blattans\u00e4tze der kultivierten Fenchelsorten werden als Gem\u00fcse verwendet. F\u00fcr den traditionell hergestellten \"F\u00fcnfwurzelsirup\" verwendete man Wilden Fenchel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), M\u00e4usedorn (Ruscus aculeatus L.), Spargel, Attich (Sambucus ebulus L.) und Petersilie.\n\nJe nach Standort wird der ausdauernde bis zweij\u00e4hrige Wilde Fenchel 80 bis 200 cm hoch. Die gl\u00e4nzenden, kahlen und verzweigten St\u00e4ngel des Wilden Fenchels sind gestreift. Die kr\u00e4ftig blaugr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten, gl\u00e4nzenden Bl\u00e4tter sind gestielt. Die Bl\u00fctezeit erstreckt sich von Juni bis August. Die kleinen, gelben Bl\u00fcten stehen in gro\u00dfen Dolden. Die l\u00e4nglich-eif\u00f6rmigen Fr\u00fcchte des Wilden Fenchels sind dunkelgrau, gestreift und kahl.

The goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is still one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a dark-gray/olive/brown carp native to east Asia (first domesticated in China) that was introduced to Europe in the late 17th century. The mutation that gave rise to the goldfish is also known from other cyprinid species, such as common carp and tench. Selective breeding over centuries has produced several color variations, some of them far removed from the \"golden\" color of the originally domesticated fish. There are also different body shapes, fin and eye configurations. Some extreme versions of the goldfish do need to be kept in an aquarium\u2014they are much less hardy than varieties closer to the \"wild\" original. However, some variations are hardier, such as the Shubunkin. The main varieties are Common Goldfish, Black Moor, Bubble Eye, Celestial Eye Goldfish, Comet-Tailed Goldfish, Fantail, Lionhead, Oranda, Pearlscale, Pompoms, Ryukin, Shubunkins, Demekin, Ranchu, Panda Moor & Veiltail. Ours are somewhere between Common and Fantail -- with large \"forked\" tails, flowing fins and an array of various colors. Goldfish do a great job cleaning up a tank but they produce a high level of PH so you need either a really good filter and / or constant water changes -- especially if you're going to have these in a tank.\n\nConvict Chichlids (Pond Sized)\nThe Convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a species of fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Central America, also known as the zebra cichlid. Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour. In natural habitats, the species feeds on crustaceans, small fish, insects, various worms, plants and algae. In 2007, the species was moved from the genus Archocentrus to a new genus, Amatitlania based on a study of Archocentus species by Juan Schmitter-Soto. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the species in Cryptoheros and Amatitlania, including Amatitlania nigrofasciata, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. A number of synonyms exist for this species including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus. Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica, and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama. Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches. Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 m (4920 feet). At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica, the pH was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while alkalinity ranged from 63 to 77 ppm CaCO3. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 \u00b0C (79-84 \u00b0F). The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia: in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R\u00e9union, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants. Convict Cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external filtration is recommended over undergravel filter systems. The relatively small size of this species, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care in the aquarium. In very large environments, these fish tend to grow rather large, their body and fin structures become more elaborate and their gray-ish color turns into more of a neon purplish-blue. When understanding the psychology of these fish, they can be made to co-exist with things such as guppies, sword tails and other fish that they would normally hunt down and kill. Doing this is not recommended unless you already know what the hell you're doing :)", "title": "Pondscape.us - Cell Phone Cam - Oscars & Lake Catfish - 2007 [01]", "publishedDate": "2008-12-24T01:51:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0eZyY7KBS8o", "description": "De una vaca y un ser humano nace esta extra\u00f1a criatura.

While Abiola Kumoye, 34, was paid \u00a32,650 as part payment to arrange the sham marriage. \nThe groom has been sentenced to 12-months-imprisonment while the bride was given an 8-months-imprisonment; meanwhile the court adjourned sentence on the best man and the marriage fixer.", "title": "Man Bags 12 Months Imprisonment Over Sham Marriage In UK", "publishedDate": "2013-07-31T14:42:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "0f58helz-Rk", "description": "Recorded solution for \"Best Left Unanswered\" from SpaceChem, a design-based puzzle game from Zachtronics Industries.\n\nDownload the demo at http://www.spacechemthegame.com today!", "title": "SpaceChem - Best Left Unanswered (259/1/16)", "publishedDate": "2011-07-03T02:02:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "0f59yno38ek", "description": "mr.m villaganas AK-47 The best fire", "title": "mr.m villaganas AK-47 The best fire", "publishedDate": "2008-07-08T00:07:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "0f5BOH1bASQ", "description": "\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430.

In today\u2019s society, whenever someone has a disease, we assume there is something we need to take for it. That is sometimes true for diabetes. Diabetes can be very severe or can be a fairly minor case. Some require just eating a bit better and getting some exercise, and their blood sugar will be just fine. Others run through multiple pills, taken together, and still can\u2019t get their diabetes under control. They may graduate to high doses of insulin, and seemingly still only have partial control.\n\nFor those who require medicine, what can they take? This is a very complex question. Those who have very high blood sugars initially, sometimes we have to start with insulin. There are those who have to get their blood sugars under control, and they are so high, that insulin is the only way. Your physician will have to make that decision.\n\nMost, however, can usually start with pills. Often, it may be a combination of medicines to get the blood sugars under control. There are many medications on the market today out there. With so many choices, any one patient may find themselves on any one of a number of different combinations of medicines. This isn\u2019t an area of medicine with there is simply one right answer. What the physician has to find is a combination that works for the patient. A combination may be different from patient to patient, and an experienced physician will use the medications to help each other in order to try to achieve proper blood sugar control.\n\nWhen it is deemed necessary for medication to be started, most physicians will begin with metformin, or Glucophage. It slows the liver\u2019s process of making blood sugar and increases insulin sensitivity. It is usually well-tolerated, but can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea from time to time. It is inexpensive and taken once to three times daily.\n\nAnother common class of medications is the sulfonylureas. These include glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl) and glyburide. They used to be used very commonly, and are still out there. They are very inexpensive. They cause more insulin to be released from the pancreas\u2019 beta cells. They are considered to be fairly strong pills, do much so they can cause low blood sugars as a side effect. They also tend to wear out over time, and so therefore are not usually a lifelong drug.\n\nAnother formerly popular class of diabetes medications was the thiazolidinediones.  They increase insulin sensitivity in fat and muscle tissue, as well as the liver. They include pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia). They do work relatively well, and have very few immediate side effects. They are slow to work, taking almost 2 to 3 months to show their results. There are thought to be associated rarely with bladder cancer, and Avandia was found to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and inflammation of the liver. Because of these concerns, Avandia is seldom used, and patients who use these medications must have their urine monitored for any sign of blood in the urine that may be associated with bladder cancer.\n\nA newer group of diabetic medications is called the DPP-4 inhibitors, which boost the effect of incretin, a hormone that helps make insulin. These include linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia).  They are usually well-tolerated, but respiratory infections and nausea are possibilities. They are easily dosed at simply a pill once a day. They are fairly new, and so therefore side effect profiles may not have been worked out completely. They are also very expensive. Furthermore, they are not profoundly strong, as very high blood sugars will not respond adequately to this medication alone.\n\nAnother newer group is called the GLP-1 agonists.  These include exenatide (Byetta or Bydureon) and liraglutide (Victoza).  They are injectable, usually given with a very small needle anywhere from twice daily (Byetta) to once weekly (Bydureon).  Nausea and vomiting are the main side effects, but on a positive note, weight loss is another side effect.  It can range anywhere from a few pounds to over twenty at times.  They are fairly powerful, and so can be a good medicine to go to if simpler therapies aren\u2019t sufficient.\n\nNewer agents are coming out all of the time, so I suspect that this section will have to be updated soon.

Pairs of shoals and reefs were compared, where one shoal was zoned 'green' (closed to fishing) and the other 'blue' or 'yellow' (open to line fishing). The demersal habitats and vertebrate communities were sampled using non-extractive Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS). These BRUVS revealed a diverse fauna of fish, sharks, rays and sea snakes, including species prized by fishers, taken as bycatch, or not vulnerable to hook and line fishing.\n\nAt each shoal multiple BRUVS (typically 12) were deployed, each recording 1 hour of underwater video. These videos were then viewed by an expert classifier and the relative abundance and species of fish and other vertebrates (such as seasnakes, turtles, whales and dolphins) seen in each video were measured and recorded. \n\nThe videos shown in this series (162 videos from all 1102 BRUVS) were selected to show the best 30 secs of the best 3 videos (based on the abundance of coral trout and red emperor) from each of the 48 study locations. \n\nThis video was taken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). http://www.aims.gov.au\n \nZone: BLUE (open to fishing)\nLocation: Hard Ground east of Great Palm I\nCamera depth: 38.7 m,\nDate taken: 29/10/06 08:03,\nBRUVSID: 5901\nOpcode: RAP16B\nCamera: 25", "title": "RAP 16B 25", "publishedDate": "2010-11-29T23:53:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ff-ivhiW2o", "description": "Andra - Abelia live happy hour", "title": "Andra - Abelia live happy hour", "publishedDate": "2011-01-29T14:21:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ff0MvV0QyE", "description": "Onako na prvu", "title": "Bozo i Repa - Boro", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T16:35:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ff2ZcWZmxo", "description": "#SaveScatterbug\nThe Elite Foursome Collab!\n\nThe Gang:\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/HDRevill\nApexxWolf: https://www.youtube.com/user/ApexxWolf\nCrunchlins: https://www.youtube.com/user/Crunchlins\nXookoh: https://www.youtube.com/user/XookohNG\n\nGo check these guys out because this collab would never have been possible without any of them!\n\nExtra Tags: Pocketmon Pocketmon Pocketmon Pok\u00e9mon Pokemon Nintendo Parody Funny Animation Flash Battle Fail Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Mew Three MewThree Mew 3 Pokemon Black White X Y 3D POK\u00c9MON PARODY Mew Three MewThree Parody\nPokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody Pokemon Parody How to Train Your Dragonite fairy pokemon YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO TRAIN ME pokemon wonder trade pokemon x y wonder trade", "title": "Wonder Trade (Pokemon X/Y Parody)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-01T20:18:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ff9VEIER0Q", "description": "Titre In\u00e9dit De Soprano", "title": "Soprano - Incurable.wmv", "publishedDate": "2010-07-03T21:45:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "0ffZt18filE", "description": "Read More http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00A3DA67G?tag=donflamingo-21\n\nBdellium Tools Professional Antibacterial Makeup Studio Line Luxury 24pc.

How can an anonymous tunnel be turned into a space full of meaning? By transporting the visitors, mentally at least, to a different place. The tunnel on the Tugelaweg - a long, rectangular tube with no columns - is ideal for this kind of temporary experience that completely immerses you. Like huge screens, you can view the two, forty-metre-long walls as windows: as man-sized windows that will give you a glimpse of another world that you can become part of. And it is here that we will be telling stories from the animal world.\n\nFrom top to bottom and front to back, both of these tunnel walls are to be fully equipped with LED strips comprising 12,000 dazzling, white lights. In front of these lights, we will place a screen of (vandal-proof) frosted, tempered glass with a natural, reed-like pattern on the visible side. In principle, all the LEDs will be fully illuminated for 24 hours a day. But within this profusion of light, a series of contours will be seen shifting across areas where the LEDs have been turned off. These will look like the contours of animals that are moving right behind the ripples in the glass. Here, a story is being told with light, or rather with the absence of light: through shadows. \nThe animal world that will be seen here comes from the Transvaal in South Africa. It comprises \"the big five\": the elephant, the rhino, the lion, the buffalo and the leopard. And just as on safari, we - the people - are mere visitors. If you're lucky, you may see a grazing buffalo, a leopard that has just woken up or an elephant lifting its head. If you're unlucky, you will see nothing at all: just light. What we experience here is the slowness and capriciousness of the daily lives of animals.

This effect can lead to regain of weight after RYGB.\nMethods: The video will demonstrate our technique for sclerotherapy to treat dilatation of the GJA utilizing endoscopy. The video will include the method for measuring the GJA for diagnosis of dilation. The video will provide instruction regarding our technique of injecting the GJA every 1cm in a circumferential manner with injection of 1mL of 5% sodium morrhuate. \nDiscussion: In one small series, sclerotherapy was shown to narrow the GJA and lead to stabilization of weight or weight loss in 91.6% of patients. Larger studies are needed to show the efficacy of sclerotherapy as a means of definitive treatment of GJA dilatation. Retrospective review and plans for prospective trials regarding the efficacy of sclerotherapy are currently underway at our institution.\n\nAbs# 8338GS\nAuthors: M.L. Simonson, MD, N. Fearing, MD, J.

Palmer, Burt Sugarman\nScreenwriter: James Carrington, Hesper Anderson, Mark Medoff\nFilm Description: Children of a Lesser God is a love story about a speech teacher who falls for a beautiful yet distant deaf girl in a small New England school for the deaf, and the obstacles that they face due to their differences. William Hurt plays James Leeds, a renegade teacher with an unconventional approach to education and a resume that includes stints as a bartender and a disk jockey. Upon his arrival, he is warned by school administrator Dr. Franklin (Philip Bosco) not to get creative with his instruction. Naturally, Leeds already has his mind set on his teaching plan and proceeds to play loud rock music in class in order to teach the students to feel the vibrations of the music and get them to try to speak phonetically. But a new element enters his life when he meets the attractive custodian, Sarah (Marlee Matlin). An exceptionally intelligent yet extremely bitter young woman, Sarah is a graduate of the school who has decided to remain there, in the confines of her world of silence; it's safer for her to be with her own \"people\" than to face what she perceives as a cruel and uncaring world. She hardly seems interested in James and will only communicate with him through signing, although she can read lips and even speak a little. James learns from Sarah's mother (Piper Laurie) that Sarah was sexually molested as a teenager; this explains why she is so wary of his attempts to form a relationship with her and why she is so full of fear. Eventually, James does get through to Sarah and the two fall in love, although both have to learn new ways to communicate their feelings. Though it seldom resembles the Mark Medoff play on which it was based, this directing debut from Randa Haines won an Best Actress Oscar for Matlin, for her first screen performance.\n\n\"children of a lesser god\",\"william hurt\",\"marlee matlin\",\"randa haines\",\"romantic dramas\",tearjerkers,\"patrick j palmer\",\"burt sugarman\",\"candace koethe\",\"frustration videos\",\"regret videos\",\"self esteem videos\",\"classroom videos\",\"library videos\",\"james leeds\",\"sarah norman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9273,/m/016khd,/m/018z_c", "title": "Children of a Lesser God (2/7) Movie CLIP - A Dark Place (1986) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T09:45:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "0fpOpW9bW0I", "description": "Summer, Jesus EP [2011]", "title": "Soviet Soviet - Aztec Aztec", "publishedDate": "2011-06-17T08:09:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0fpVch99UM0", "description": "Hundreds of people gathered in Royce Quad to mourn the recent deaths of UC Santa Barbara students in the Isla Vista tragedy.

Several thousand gallbladder operations are performed in Victoria each year. Although the surgery is sometimes considered minor, this is not the case and severe complications, although very uncommon, can occur.\n\nWhy choose LapSurgery Australia for your gallbladder operation?\nLapSurgery Australia surgeons have a major interest in the management of patients with gall stone disease. We offer ALL of the procedural options that are required for complete management of gall stones and their possible complications including ERCP.\n\nLapSurgery Australia surgeons were among the first in Australia to perform keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder and now have experience of over several thousand such operations.\n\nLapSurgery Australia surgeons specialise in advanced laparoscopic operations well beyond the complexity of gallbladder surgery. It's nice to know that these skills and experience are available to you for your gallbladder surgery.\n\nChris graduated in surgery from Monash University after which he undertook specialisation in the United Kingdom in advanced laparoscopic surgery. He gained his Australian Fellowship in surgery in 1994. \n\nChris was a senior lecturer at Monash University Department of Surgery, involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and clinical research. He joined Ray McHenry and Richard Gilhome in 1998.\n\nChris has particular interests in advanced minimal access surgery (laparoscopic surgery) including bilateral endoscopic thorascopic sympathectomy (ETS), gastric banding, hiatus hernia, cholecystectomy and other general surgery as well as upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy.", "title": "Gallbladder Disease After LapSurgery, Diet and Food Groups Dr Chris Hensman", "publishedDate": "2014-02-07T00:14:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "0g2Mc_WNXCM", "description": "Watch more Basketball Moves videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/513952-How-to-Do-a-ChangeofPace-Dribble-Basketball-Moves\n\nLearn how to dribble faster from former top-ranking college basketball player Jason Curry in this Howcast video.\n\n\nJason:  Right now we'll talk about how to dribble the basketball faster. And handling the ball with speed is good because it makes it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball from you. So right now we'll walk through a couple of quick drills that we use on a regular basis that help us to handle the ball faster.\n\nFirst ting we want to do is work on a particular drill and then you want to try to go for speed in it. Right now we have one of our coaches, Jerry, who's gonna time us on these particular drills. Right now Sammy will go for 15 seconds and what'll we'll do right now is he's gonna do his first set for 15 seconds and then we'll have him do a second set to see if he can increase his speed as far ball handling.\n \nSo right now, Sammy will get nice and low. He's gonna cross over and go behind his back. Every time the ball gets to his right hand, he's gonna count the rep. So I'll count for him right now. Jerry when you tell me to go, we'll go.\n\nJerry:  Ready, go!\n\nJason:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Alright. So Sammy did eight in 15 seconds. So now he has a goal where every time he works out he has a point of emphasis in the base as far as trying to exceed his time. \n\nNow I'll try to do something a little bit more advanced with the advanced ball handlers. And remember, everything that we do I'm gonna try to do with my eyes closed and head up. Jerry'll give me 30 seconds on this.\n\nJerry:  Ready, go!\n\nJason:  One, two, three, four, five, I lose it, I come right back. Eyes closed, chin up. Six. \n\nJerry:  Stop.\n\nJason:  Alright? So I got to about six and a half. So right now we'll have Sammy finish up to see if he can do it any faster than he did his first set. So again Sammy will have his eyes closed, chin up. He'll get low. Eight is his number to beat. 15 seconds.\n\nJerry:  Ready, go!\n\nJason:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. \n\nJerry:  Stop.\n\nJason:  Alright. So you see? Now, Sammy worked on his ball handling. He was able to get ten.

This happens because of a durable water repellent treatment (DWR) that's applied at manufacture to all jackets. But dirt, oil and normal household detergents will, over time, mask the DWR, causing the outside of the jacket to absorb water (wetting out). 'Wetting out' reduces breathability, comfort and performance and can make the jacket feel cold and wet to the touch. Grangers' cleaners and proofers remove dirt, oils and stains and restores the product to its original performance, or as we like to say 'Original performance restored'. \n\nGranger's cleaner also contain an anti-odour agent which helps prevent odours from building up on clothes -- helping keep your garments smelling fresher between washes.\n \nEnvironment\n \nAll Granger's cleaners are biodegradeable, phosphate free and use bluesign\u00ae approved formulations.\n\nAs Granger's cleaners contain no brighteners and perfumes they are suitable for use on hunting garments as they leave no scent or UV reflective chemical on the garments.\n \nWith Merino garments in particular there is another common problem -- damage caused by moths. The larvae of moths in the Tineidae family eat wool and silk fabrics, resulting in holes in the garments. Keeping your garments clean is the most effective way of preventing them as oils and sweat will provide a good source of nutrition for the larvae. Cedar cabinets have been used for centuries to store clothes -- so as an additional measure to help protect the garments we have added a small amount of natural Cedar oil to our Merino Cleaner to help keep moths away.", "title": "Grangers Merino Cleaner How To Guide", "publishedDate": "2013-04-23T13:34:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gCclC3j1gA", "description": "Silhuetas, Por do sol, O poleiro das aves terrestres,  seriema, Cariama cristata, Mato grosso do Sul,Sunset, The perch of land birds, Puesta del sol, La perca de aves terrestres, Tramonto, Il pesce persico di uccelli terrestri, Coucher de soleil, La perche des oiseaux terrestres, Sonnenuntergang, Der Barsch von Grundst\u00fccken V\u00f6gel,", "title": "Por do sol, O poleiro das aves terrestres,  seriema, Cariama cristata, Mato grosso do Sul,", "publishedDate": "2013-01-23T22:26:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gD5SzE7Mzg", "description": "Lee Chun Hee Washing-Radish with Soap ENG-SUBS\nthose who want to download this video you can go to savevid.com and copy the url then put it in the savevid url.", "title": "Lee Chun Hee Washing Radish with Soap ENG-SUBS", "publishedDate": "2013-03-13T12:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gDBe4-CIzY", "description": "600 acres for sale!

The raw baby octopus is showered in a delightful cascade of sesame oil before being devoured and when it eventually is, it clings to the cheeks and throats of the diner via its suction cups\n\nEach tentacle encompasses its own brain and therefore likes to squirm and slither as it is being eaten.  If Sanakji is not chewed thoroughly before swallowing the person eating it risks having the octopus cling to the diners throat with its suction cups, causing choking and asphyxiation\n\nThe cruelty of this dish is hotly debated. The tentacles themselves are not, technically speaking, alive. The post-cutting movement is essentially the twitching of nerves reacting to their sudden loss of command from the octopus' brain. Although it will continue, quite astoundingly, for about 20-30 minutes after it has been cut up, there is no possibility that the tentacles are suffering as they're chewed up. Disturbing side note: the tentacles do, however, react in a rather pissed off manner to being doused in spicy sauce). But while the tentacles are nothing more than twitching nerves, the head of the octopus is often left to stare at you while you consume it (some of the braver people eat the head too)\n\nIs sannakji cruel? Personally, I'd feel better if the head of the octopus was promptly killed afterward. It would take nothing from the dish which doesn't typically feature the head. At least that way there is nothing potentially panicking on your plate\n\nSannakji in essence is basically no different than sashimi that is served at sushi bars except that it is still living and alive, making it even more fresh \n\nOnce tentacles are severed from the head, residual nerve activity keeps them squirming for a long time. They don't taste like much at all, but once dipped in sesame oil and chile paste, there's nothing quite like a bunch of suckers furiously attaching themselves to your lips, tongue, and cheeks\n\nI was told\u2014though I've found no evidence of it\u2014that nakji's envigorating qualities are such that at one time they were fed to exhausted oxen. In fact, along with live snakes they are given to combatants in Korean bullfights prebout\n\nThere are plenty of anecdotes about the hazards of sannakji. Several poor sots are said to choke to death on them every year, and I was told they're rarely eaten raw in the warm months because warm-water nakji harbor nasty bacteria\n\nSannakji  is the ultimate food dare for risk-takers wandering through Korea. This delicacy consists of fresh, wriggling pieces of live baby octopus, drizzled with sesame oil. After minimal preparation, it is served immediately. Although it looks quite frightening, the octopus itself is merely chewy and relatively tasteless\n\nIf you are up for the challenge, here are the steps you should take:\n\n1. In Seoul, go to Noryangjin station on subway line 1.\n\nNoryangjin market is one of the largest fish markets in Korea. Search for baby octopi as you stumble through a maze of assorted shellfish, flatfish, blobs of sea cucumber, and pushy vendors. Negotiating prices through miming can be tiresome. It's best to bring a Korean phrasebook or learn the numbers and how to say, \"how much is it?\" (Ol-ma-ae-yo?) You may even strike a better deal  \n\n3. Dip the tentacles in sesame oil\n\nWhen the waiter serves your long awaited plate of octopi massacre, dip the tentacles in sesame oil before chewing. The suction cups on the tentacles are still active due to residual nerve activity, even though the octopus has been chopped to bits. Sesame oil prevents the tentacles from sticking to your mouth or throat\n\n4. Chew thoroughly\n\nTo avoid choking, chew each piece thoroughly. Choking on partially-chewed pieces of sannakji has led to many deaths, especially when intoxicated. Some expert sannakji eaters enjoy the feeling of squirming tentacles gliding down their throats, but novice eaters must be cautious\n\n5. Ask for the remaining octopi to be cooked\n\nEventually the wiggling will lessen, and the restaurant will gladly cook the remaining octopi\n\n6. Next time, eat the entire octopus at once\n\nIs eating sannakji as badass as it sounds? Probably not, since many children have tried it and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. Revel in this Korean culinary experience by choosing your own octopus at the market. As you potentially struggle to eat the squirming, worm-like pieces, watch groups of Koreans eat it with ease. Most likely, they will be red-faced, taking shots of soju,Korean liquor, at the same time", "title": "strange dude eats a living octopus in korea", "publishedDate": "2013-11-16T22:40:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gHobBMI2xc", "description": "\u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez de la Rubia, pod\u00f3logo deportivo nos cuenta cada semana los casos de lesiones deportivas m\u00e1s comunes que pasan por su consulta.\nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n hablamos del tratamiento de una tendinitis aqu\u00edlea, lo que traducido al lenguaje menos experto ser\u00eda una inflamaci\u00f3n del tend\u00f3n de aquiles.", "title": "Los casos de \u00c1ngel: Tendinitis aqu\u00edlea", "publishedDate": "2012-11-26T11:11:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gI7_j9cZRU", "description": "Clint Smith - Beltway Poetry Semi-Finals", "title": "Clint Smith - \"Aristotle\" (Beltway Poetry Semi-Finals)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-27T13:35:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gIGqJEl1KE", "description": "Subscribe http://bit.ly/1kQd4Tn Solusi buat akun twitter yang suka ngetwit sendiri: Tutorial Revoke Access Auot-Tweet.

It airs on ABC, Monday 3rd November, 8pm\n\n\nThe woman who tracked down and fell in love with the 'anonymous' sperm donor who gave her a healthy baby girl - after losing her two sons to a rare genetic disorder\n\nAt the age of 42 newly single Aminah Hart made a decision that changed her life in a way that she never could have imagined, leading her to meet and fall in love with the stranger whose sperm she used to conceive her daughter.\nAt the time, the Melbourne professional wanted to have a child but had already suffered the tragic loss of two sons due to a genetic disorder called x-linked myotubular myopathy, a condition that affects muscles used for movement and occurs almost exclusively in boys.\nHer first son Marlon, conceived with her former husband, died at the age of four months, while she was living in England, and in 2010 when Aminah was living back in Australia, Louis - fathered by a former partner - died at the age of 14 months.\n\u2018You can\u2019t really put it into words. I had two relationships and two children but it wasn't until the second one that I got a diagnosis of the genetic disorder,\u2019 Aminah told Daily Mail Australia.\nScroll down for video \n\n\nShe had always anticipated she would have children but she said it wasn\u2019t until her early 30s that she began to seriously think about it.\nAt 42, Aminah felt like time was running out but she was also faced with the prospect that the genetic disorder has a 1 in 4 chance of occurring in every pregnancy.\nShe thought long and hard about her options and decided to use a sperm donor to conceive.\n'It took me a long time to make the decision and I considered everything: my age, social status and that I carried a fatal genetic disorder\u2026 I had the understanding that I wasn't a great prospect.'\nAminah decided to 'give it one last go'.\nShe was given three pieces of paper by the fertility clinic with the vital statistics of three anonymous men \u2013 one of whom would become not only the biological father of her daughter but her future partner.\n\n\nWhen deciding which sperm donor to choose she looked for a man that had the key qualities she wanted in her child.\n\u2018You don\u2019t get a photo, it\u2019s literally just a profile - less than a LinkedIn page, with vital statistics, age, body build, hair colour, interests as a kid , and job,\u2019 Aminah explained.\nThe donor that stood out from the three was a man who described himself as \u2018happy and easy going\u2019 with a strong work ethic.\n\u2018He also had a really clean genetic background and there wasn\u2019t anything lurking in his family in terms of disability\u2026 I also looked at mental health because my own resilience had been what got me through the trauma I experienced and I wanted a child as equally resilient,\u2019 Aminah said.\nScott Andersen\u2019s sperm had been in 'quarantine' since 2010 when Aminah chose it in 2011, so the sperm bank had time to rule out diseases.\nHer chosen donor also already had four happy healthy children, which reassured Aminah.\n\n\nShe had grown up without knowing her own father, having last seen him when she was just 11 months old, so was keen for her future child to meet their father.\n\u2018Scott said on his profile that he was happy to meet any child that was conceived,\u2019 Aminah added.\nWhen baby Leila was born on August 14, 2012, weighing a \u2018big and healthy\u2019 3.9 kilos, Aminah said she felt \u2018relieved\u2019.\n\u2018Honestly when she came out I felt nothing else just relieved and overwhelmed that I had a child in my arms\u2026 the pregnancy had been horrific as I\u2019d been unable to relax,\u2019 she added.\nLeila was back in hospital in a critical condition just three weeks later suffering a problem with her airways but doctors saved her life with emergency surgery and Aminah was once again able to enjoy her happy, healthy little girl.\nMeanwhile, Aminah\u2019s mother Helen had grown increasingly interested in who Leila\u2019s father might be as her blonde hair and blue eyes were in contrast to Aminah\u2019s West Indian appearance.\n\n\n\u2018Six months later my mum had been snooping around Google. She knew that Scott had said he was a cattle breeder and was an amateur footy coach,\u2019 Aminah said.\nDespite thinking it wasn\u2019t a good idea at first, when her mum became convinced she\u2019d found Leila\u2019s father Aminah decided to contact the agency and offer her details in case he wanted to get in touch or see a photo of his daughter.\n\u2018Mum had dug out a photo from his football club and I said \u201cI really don\u2019t know\u201d, but she could see a similarity in a six month old baby. They do both have blonde hair and blue eyes\u2026 she is cute as a button.\u2019", "title": "Australian Story: Three Bits Of Paper", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T03:04:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gPGBxR1JUw", "description": "Sportini\u0173 aprang\u0173 gamintojas \"RIND\"\nwww.rind.lt", "title": "RIND promo_long (LT)", "publishedDate": "2013-03-04T19:19:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gPisG0f09c", "description": "Desata tu lado salvaje con la Wild Collection de Old Spice, que puede hacer de cualquier hombre, un hombre hombre incre\u00edblemente confiado, interesante, atractivo y seductor.", "title": "Old Spice | Desata tu lado salvaje", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T19:08:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gPnjfGh3Uc", "description": "How to Duplicate items and weapons\n\n\n\nAll Secret Files\nhttp://youtu.be/7boFFmESEyM\nAll Voice Recordings\nhttp://youtu.be/U883KvecpHw\nAll Guide Books\nhttp://youtu.be/DpM6i4uvEuU\nAll Diaries\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D_RY2JAnTA\nAll Postcards\nhttp://youtu.be/TaaXSCnCdew\nUnlimited Shotgun Ammo & Weapon Location\nhttp://youtu.be/SV2zGPa2wjI\nTwins Trophy Achievement Guide \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iGhapZBql0\nUnlimited Sniper Ammo & Weapon Location\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAiLHtQaZpk\nGuaranteed Orange weapons\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4lQnQXzbLQ\nHow to Duplicate Weapons - Exploit\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWTyRk2m6gw\nUnlimited XP & Money (Food/PainKiller Exploit)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmpkPGH7I4c\nUnlimited LAW Rocket Launcher Ammo & Weapon Location - Exploit\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se4ZqqMvPeI\n\n\nCheck out Cheat Code Central at http://www.cheatcc.com for all your video game needs.

This patient has undergone a blepharoplasty procedure in the past at another clinic and came to Dr. Solomon seeking to correct the results of that procedure. The intention of this revision blerpharoplasty it to lift the lower eyelid in order to prevent tearing and improve the aesthetics.\nDr. Solomon begins the procedure by dissecting down to the orbital rim at the outside edge of the affected eye. He cuts down to the bone and creates a tarsal strip before removing overlying skin. This will allow him to move the lower eyelid up and correct its migration. He then places sutures along the side of the lower eyelid along the tarsal strip as well as around the lower tarsal plate. By tightening these sutures, he draws the skin of the lower eyelid into position. The skin is then closed and sutured to allow for healing.\nOnce the skin has closed we can see that the lower eyelid is in a much better position and is no longer lax. It is balanced with the right side of his face and has greatly improved upon the function and aesthetics of the patient\u2019s eye. \nhttp://www.solomonfacialplastic.com/facial-plastic-surgery/blepharoplasty.php\nhttp://www.solomonfacialplastic.com/before-&-after-gallery/blepharoplasty/", "title": "Ectropion Correction Revision Blepharoplasty | Dr. Philip Solomon Toronto", "publishedDate": "2014-08-12T04:52:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gQ8lAepctg", "description": "Police officer who smashed pensioner's car window with truncheon wins \u00a3400,000 compensation \nA police officer has won more than \u00a3400,000 compensation after being branded a \"laughing stock\" for using a truncheon to smash a pensioner's car window.\n\nPc Mike Baillon, 42, quit his job after becoming the butt of jokes from fellow officers over a YouTube video of him battering the Range Rover of a 74-year-old driver.\n\nThe video of Pc Baillon wielding his truncheon became a YouTube sensation - with an employment tribunal being told it has been viewed online thousands of times.\n\nThe tribunal in Cardiff heard Pc Baillon walked out of his job after being ridiculed every day by his colleagues at the police station where he worked.\n\nHe sued police chiefs for constructive dismissal after being relieved of carrying out frontline duties.\n\nThe experienced officer claimed damages for allegedly being bullied by fellow officers.\n\nHe has been awarded \u00a3429,434.64 for loss of pension had he stayed in the force until the end of his career.\n\nMr Baillon will also receive in the region of \u00a310,000 for loss of earnings since leaving the force.\n\nFormer traffic officer PC Baillon told the tribunal: \"The ridicule from colleagues was getting to me - it was every single day.\n\n\"They thought I had done wrong and I was lucky to have got away with it.

Their conduct has been reprehensible. It is a public disgrace.\"\n\nMr Baillon said later: \"I would rather be driving police cars but I couldn't accept the treatment.\n\n\"Unfortunately it has taken so long to reach a settlement.\"\n\nAfter leaving the force, Mr Baillon set up a company called Celtic Woodcraft making decorative wooden reindeer.\n\nMr Whatley has previously won a \u00a320,000 payout from the police over the damage caused to his Range Rover.\n\nHe was later ordered to pay \u00a3235 after being found guilty of speeding and failing to stop for police.", "title": "Police officer who smashed pensioner's car window with truncheon wins \u00a3400,000 compensation", "publishedDate": "2014-02-06T08:43:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gQcUJA-3QE", "description": "Musique : Noosa - Walk On By (Sound Remedy Remix)\nCommentaires d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9s.

OutdoorFreaks.net\n\nHey guys today were reviewing the muddy tree harness, it is called the safeguard, it is a light and simple design, and we are just going to go over it here real quick. Simple to put on, just like a backpack, you got your tether here that attaches to the tree strap when you up in a stand or you're moving up in a climber, three simple attachments here, you put it through here, these are all very simple and easy to adjust, the leg straps on the muddys are really very nice. They are camo which I don't really care about, but they are padded which is a very nice addition; I think the padding is nice so that the straps don't really dig into my legs when I am up on the stand. And they're thin which means they're probably lighter, which I also enjoy. And that's really it, it also comes with a binocular strap which I really appreciate, when I'm hunting I have my binoculars, a rangefinder and a bird call, or maybe something else around my neck, and the fact that I can put my binoculars on my harness, and they are out of the way means, and that I can access them quickly which is very, very nice, and a great feature. My hunter safety system didn't have that and I think that I am really going to appreciate it this fall. That's really about it, you have your two D loops to attach your harness or your alignment belt, this is also very easy to adjust or to use, there are great instructions in the box on how to use it, there are videos online as well. I think it really is a can't miss product, I think it's real simple, easy, light, and I think that it is definitely something that I am going to want to wear. I'm not going to really give up anything if I do wear it. I'm not going to weigh anymore, it's not going to be any less comfortable if I was up in a stand without it, and that is really what you want in a harness. Like Larry says on the website, it's useless unless you wear it, and I think that I will definitely be wearing this one, I'm very excited, and ready for October to roll around.

Banjir lahar yang mengangkut material pasir, batu dan potongan kayu tersebut berpotensi membawa kerusakan dahsyat dan jatuhnya korban jiwa bila tidak diantisipasi.\n\n\"Banjir lahar terjadi pada Selasa (18/2) pada pukul 16.30 WIB. Material yang dibawa lahar yang terbawa air hujan itu mengancam daerah sekitar lereng,\" kata Kepala Pusat Data dan Humas BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho saat dihubungi, Selasa malam.\n\nSutopo mengatakan, kabar adanya kerusakan dan jatuhnya korban manusia masih simpang siur. Berdasarkan laporan BPBD Kabupaten Blitar, longsoran lahar tersebut menyebabkan sebuah plansengan dam, di wilayah Kecamatan Kepung ambrol.

Sin embargo, en aproximadamente 1 de cada 200 fetos solo se observa una \u00fanica arteria umbilical, circunstancia que, tradicionalmente, se ha asociado a un riesgo incrementado de anomal\u00edas cromos\u00f3micas y estructurales, as\u00ed como a resultados perinatales adversos. El diagn\u00f3stico de Arteria Umbilical Unica se realiza por ecograf\u00eda obteniendo una imagen de una secci\u00f3n transversal del cord\u00f3n umbilical en la que se observan directamente los vasos, o bien, observando como s\u00f3lo una arteria umbilical  rodea la vejiga urinaria antes de entrar en el cord\u00f3n. El diagn\u00f3stico ecografico es m\u00e1s preciso en la ecograf\u00eda del segundo o tercer trimestre, pues en la ecografia de las semanas 11 y 14  solo se detectan alrededor del 50% de los casos. El significado cl\u00ednico de la Arteria Umbilical Unica (AUU) es actualmente controvertido. Actualmente parece existir evidencia sobre todo lo siguiente:\n- La AUU se asocia con relativa frecuencia a malformaciones (principalmente genitourinarias y cardiacas). Cuando se asocia a otras malformaciones, el riesgo de cromosomopat\u00edas est\u00e1 incrementado (mucho m\u00e1s cuando el numero de malformaciones asociadas es alto), y por tanto es recomendable, en estos casos, realizar estudio del cariotipo fetal.\n- La frecuente asociaci\u00f3n a malformaciones cardiacas puede hacer recomendable realizar estudio ecocardiografico fetal, aunque las mayor\u00eda de las malformaciones asociadas suelen ser detectadas mediante el estudio morfol\u00f3gico fetal simple.\n- Cuando la AUU est\u00e1 aislada, es decir, no asociada a otras malformaciones fetales, la probabilidad de que el feto padezca una cromosomopat\u00eda es escasa, por lo que no parece justificado recomendar estudio del cariotipo fetal. \n- La AUU aislada parece estar asociada a una mayor probabilidad de que la gestaci\u00f3n se complique con Restricci\u00f3n del Crecimiento Intrauterino, oligoamnios o hidramnios, por lo que es conveniente realizar una monitorizaci\u00f3n seriada de la gestaci\u00f3n hasta el t\u00e9rmino.", "title": "Arteria Umbilical \u00danica (Single Umbilical Artery)", "publishedDate": "2011-10-15T22:16:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gSXKs_1q44", "description": "back to part 1 : http://youtu.be/S0b_L-tEL5k\nmore to Episode 027 Part 1 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YixN5Ypj-QQ", "title": "Dalam Mihrab Cinta Episode 026 Part 4", "publishedDate": "2012-08-29T18:47:15.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gSc52AO2co", "description": "Background song = Maxx Baer - Caprisun (Grimm Remix)\n\nHOLY VAPING CRAZINESS!

Let's show the law makers how much we care about our beautiful beaches and seas: like and share this video, using the hashtag #marinelitter and let's make a noise about the problem of plastics in our seas!\n\nTo find out more and take action, visit http://www.seas-at-risk.org", "title": "Our Plastic, Our Problem (A marine litter info-operetta!)", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T12:35:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "0g_lt0FcQag", "description": "Ticks are very nasty parasites that can give pets and people some dangerous diseases.

Here's the story about how it all started back in 1924. \n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oqg3iE\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "The History Behind UNC's Rameses", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T19:49:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gb2DvVXR-U", "description": "i love you me little turtle (Kame)\n\nhttp://facedl.com/fvideo.php?f=oikaoxknnuiiuon&2010-12-10-sc-plastic-tears-kamenashi-kazuya", "title": "plastic tears kamenashi kazuya", "publishedDate": "2013-01-11T17:22:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gbAIJ36ya0", "description": "", "title": "Just a little argon gas to save someones life", "publishedDate": "2013-06-28T16:55:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "0gbPIyCuGTA", "description": "Documentary from the BBC charting the rise and fall of Hannibal, the Carthage Warrior.

Hot off of those aforementioned EPs by the way, the band performed on NPR Mountain Stage, on Music City Roots, and had a Bob Dylan cover on the Carrie soundtrack. Before their show at Mercury Lounge in NYC, the band performed and sat down for a chat on A-Sides with Jon Chattman. It was rad. You are rad for watching.

These highly complex three-dimensional data have to be displayed simultaneously in order to convey spatial relationships. Unique challenges in information and interaction design have to be solved in order to keep the visualization sufficiently complete and uncluttered at the same time. The visualization method presented in this paper addresses these issues by using a hybrid combination of polygonal rendering of brain structures and direct volume rendering of activation data. Advanced rendering techniques including illustrative display styles and ambient occlusion calculations enhance the clarity of the visual output. The presented rendering pipeline produces real-time frame rates and offers a high degree of configurability. Newly designed interaction and measurement tools are provided, which enable the user to explore the data at large, but also to inspect specific features closely. We demonstrate the system in the context of a cognitive neurosciences dataset.  An initial informal evaluation shows that our visualization method is deemed useful for clinical research.\n\nLink to thesis:\nhttp://www.jainek.de/projects/iBrain/\n\nLink to publication:\nhttp://www.janfischer.com/pub_pages/pub-jainek08-eurovis.html\n\nReference:\nW.

It's an autoimmune disorder that's linked to the HLA B27 gene.(HLA B27 gene).  It is often triggered by a urinary tract or intestinal infection.  It's most common in individuals aged 20-40 and more common in men than in women.  The symptoms of reactive arthritis often include a combination of three symptoms: inflammatory arthritis, inflammation of the eye (show eye), and inflammation of the urinary tract.  So \"the patient can't see, can't pee, can't bend the knee.\"  The first symptom usually felt is burning pain on urination or increased frequency of urination.  Men can have prostatitis and women can have vaginitis.  The arthritis usually affects large joints such as the knees. A strange rash on the bottoms of the feet can develop.  This is called keratodermia blenorrhagica.  20 to 40 percent of men can get circinate balanitis on the end of the penis. And no... I'm not going to show a picture of that.

Donate Now!\nIn this tutorial, Sandra Johnson M.D., discusses warts. Please visit our site for more information about other dermatological conditions. \n\nKey Points\n\n*Benign (noncancerous) growths of the skin caused by infection with a virus\n*Often multiple; vary in appearance and location\n*Treatment options are numerous because no one type of treatment works well\n\nWarts (verruca vulgares) are universal, caused by infection by viruses from the family of human papilloma virus. They may occur on any part of the body, but predominate on areas typically exposed to repeated minor trauma, such as the hands, feet, knees and elbows. Occurring either singly or more frequently in multiples, they are flesh colored to pink and present with a rough scaly surface. Most people contract wart virus during their youth. They are harmless, although at times may be quite a nuisance because of physical discomfort or objectionable because of their  appearance. Untreated,Viral warts may persist  for years, but usually do eventually regress. Warts in the groin area are known as condyloma accuminatum or Genital warts.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis: (Other conditions with similar appearance)\n*Callouses/corns\n*Lichen planus\n*Squamous cell carcinoma\n\nCommon Warts are usually easily recognizable, but when located on a palm or sole and covered with thick scale may resemble a callous or corn. The possibility of squamous cell carcinoma should be entertained for a lesion that enlarging, crusted, ulcerated, bleeding or recalcitrant to repeated attempts at therapy. Planar (flat) warts on the face may simulate whiteheads and if present on the forearms, wrists, or legs may mimic Lichen planus.\n\nTreatment\n\nWarts are notoriously difficult to treat; this is why there are so many treatment options available. This recalcitrance to therapy is also the reason that so many \"alternative\" and home remedies exist. When considering therapeutic options, one must keep in mind that Warts are benign, that they will (eventually!) go away on their own, and that some treatments may be associated with the risk of scarring. Typical treatments include:\n\n*Cryotherapy (freezing) with liquid nitrogen\n*Application of slicylic acid at home or in the office\n*Immunotherapy (Injections directly into the Warts performed in the office designed to stimulate a person's own immune response against the virus)\n*Prescription medications applied topically in the office (podophyllum; Cantharidin) or at home (imiquomod; flourouracil; tretinoin)\n*Surgical therapies, including electrodessication and curretage; laser\n* Injections with bleomycin in the office\n*Topical immunotherapy/sensitization therapy\n*Oral cimetidine or vitamin A ( as prescribed by your physician)", "title": "Warts 101", "publishedDate": "2014-01-31T16:30:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "0h8-W5I0xM8", "description": "A new\u00a0report\u00a0says the\u00a0Fairtrade movement is not benefiting\u00a0the\u00a0people it was set up to protect.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe movement is supposed\u00a0to help workers in developing countries by ensuring they get proper pay.\n\u00a0\nBut that is not always the case especially in Africa.\n\u00a0\nAl Jazeera's Sonia Gallego reports. .\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/", "title": "Fairtrade 'not benefiting the poor'", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T02:09:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "0h835cmELog", "description": "Just south of Anchorage AK there is the Whittier tunnel, the longest one lane tunnel in north America.

They wanted to create a game different from FFXI and producer Hiromichi Tanaka nurtured their creativity by not meddling.\n\nThe graphics were gorgeous, but the game was buggy, incomplete, and just really frustrating. Negative beta feedback gave the development team second thoughts, but they had the Final Fantasy name and FFXI was becoming the most profitable of the series! So in 2010, they released as scheduled, earning such accolades as Most Disappointing Game of the Year.\n\nFFXIV damaged the Final Fantasy brand, prompting Square Enix to formally apologize, and replace a large chunk of the development team.\n\nNew, unknown producer Naoki Yoshida and his team worked day and night to find a solution. The original team's programming made starting FF14 over the fastest course. They spent two years completely revamping the graphics engine, combat system and interface.\n\nIn August 2013, when the servers became congested, they extended the beta and added new servers. Messing up twice would destroy Square Enix. The company expenses, resources, and delay of other Square Enix games would all be worth it with the launch of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn-- producing a game worthy of the Final Fantasy name, earning multiple MMO of the Year awards, and making it up to fans. \n\n\nHave Fun!\n\n---------\n\nThe Daily Byte: http://bit.ly/1bsstnb\nLore! http://bit.ly/nNfsws\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\nJOIN POLARIS: http://bit.ly/17MTzDW\nPOLARISGO: http://bit.ly/1ec7Hu6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4\nMusic courtesy of Epidemic Sound and Audio Micro\n\n---------\n\nThanks for watching Lore!", "title": "LORE -- Final Fantasy XIV Dev Lore in a Minute!", "publishedDate": "2014-04-18T21:40:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "0h9nRb4mcTg", "description": "My arrangement of Stolen Dance by Milky Chance.\n\nMaybe you don't know the song but if you get a chance listen to his music video.
