What is important for you to realize is that during the fix, I am turning the screen OFF/ON by the top left button (the one on the actual top of the blackberry). Also, when you remove the casing from the BB, you will notice a copper-colored ribbon that attaches the LCD to the motherboard. This ribbon is KEY. In the video, you will see me take my thumbnail, press down on the BOTTOM section of the ribbon, and my blackberry will come back to life! Hopefully yours will too! My final solution was to cut a very small piece of electrical tape into a small square, and wedge this in between the ribbon and the LCD screen, as to apply pressure on the ribbon like my thumbnail did. I wish you the best... and I hope this helps at least ONE person out there! By the way, this is NOT a tutorial on disassembling your BB.

Before I do that though, I do want to stress that gastric bypass has become a very safe surgery, and most likely the risks of being obese outweigh the risks of the surgery. When we talk about the potential risks of gastric bypass surgery we like to compare it to the risks of other commonly performed surgery. \n\nIt's important to realize that gastric bypass surgery is very safe. In fact, the mortality rate or the risk of dying is less than half a percent. Take this and compare it to say, prostate surgery, where the mortality risk is greater than that. It's approximately half a percent, or 0.5 percent, so while complications are possible after gastric bypass surgery, overall it's a very safe and effective surgery. \n\nOne of the major risks of any major weight loss surgery is blood clots that can occur postoperatively. Patients who are obese are at a higher risk of developing blood clots. You want to make sure that if you do undergo gastric bypass that you're up walking around, as soon as you can after surgery to help decrease that risk. \n\nSpecific to gastric bypass, one of the complications that can occur is what's called a leak, so in gastric bypass we use a stapler that cuts your stomach and makes a small pouch. In addition, there are two areas where your intestines are cut and reconnected. If those connections or if that staple line doesn't heal properly, you could potentially have what's called a leak, which in essence is an infection. If that happens, your surgeon will need to most likely perform another procedure to fix it. \n\nAnother risk or complication that can happen after gastric bypass are ulcers. You want to make sure that you avoid NSAIDS, things like aspirin and ibuprofen, after gastric bypass surgery. In addition, you want to make sure that you don't smoke and that you don't drink an excessive amount of alcohol. \n\nOne last potential complication of gastric bypass is an intestinal obstruction. If you've had gastric bypass surgery and you're experiencing abdominal pain, even several years later, make sure you speak with your surgeon, because you could potentially have a blockage in your intestines, which would require another surgery to correct it. These are only some of the potential complications that can happen after gastric bypass surgery. But remember overall, it is a very safe and effective surgery.", "title": "Gastric Bypass Surgery Complications | Obesity", "publishedDate": "2013-07-17T06:18:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6EBc6MMPClk", "description": "Most of our flights are for Flight Training purposes, but sometimes we just like to have fun.

As an extra treat, Ronnie and Del perform each tune together before it's broken down into its component parts.Throughout this lesson, Ronnie provides invaluable tips on many aspects of mandolin playing, including use of split strings, the double-time shuffle, right hand technique (keeping a loose wrist), working with tremolo, keeping good rhythm, back-ups with double- and triple-stops, improvisation and much more. Playing his Gilchrist mandolin, Ronnie provides advice about tuning up, as well as the strings, picks and other equipment he uses.Like so many other bluegrass mandolinists, Ronnie's primary influence (aside from his dad) was the great Bill Monroe, and he starts his lesson with the famous Monroe \"downstroke\" style. The \"Bluegrass Twist\" is a perfect vehicle for the bluesy licks, runs and blues scales that were among Bill Monroe's trademark sounds, and you'll learn the solo phrase by phrase.Ola Belle Reed's powerful \"High on the Mountain\" was the first tune Ronnie learned on mandolin, and he shows all the special tricks in playing this beautiful mountain song. Ronnie goes on to teach his own tribute to Bill Monroe, \"Glen Rock,\" as well as show-stoppers such as \"Quicksburg Rondezvous,\" \"Baltimore Jonny\" and the perennial Monroe favorite, \"Rawhide.\"The Del McCoury band is well known for the influence the blues has played on their music, and Ronnie covers the classic \"How Long Blues\" as well as country-flavored hits such as \"I Feel the Blues Movin' In,\" \"Highway of Pain,\" and \"Don't Stop the Music.\" This intensive lesson in mandolin playing will greatly enhance your technique, and add some powerful tunes to your repertoire.", "title": "The Bluegrass Mandolin of Ronnie McCoury", "publishedDate": "2010-07-28T20:20:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ELJNGEGyys", "description": "Das Kitzb\u00fcheler Horn ist ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel im Herzen der Kitzb\u00fcheler Alpen und Ausgangspunkt vieler Spazier- und Wanderwege.\nDie Auffahrt \u00fcber die Panoramastra\u00dfe (7,5 km) oder mit der Seilbahn ist bereits ein unvergessliches Erlebnis.

Bourbon is strictly American. It's made by a certain codified legal process, and it has a tradition and a history, and a more narrow flavor profile than just whiskey as a category or scotch specifically.

Another characteristic of the berceuse, for no reason other than convention, is a tendency to stay on the \"flat side\"; noted examples including the berceuses by Chopin, who pioneered the form,[2] Liszt, and Balakirev, which are all in D\u266d.\n\nHope you enjoy the video! :)", "title": "Berceuse - Peter Nuttall", "publishedDate": "2011-08-09T02:07:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ER7BYPZzyU", "description": "Got some nice pictures of it, but I just needed a video of it.

If you haven't seen the video yet check it out here: http://youtu.be/s-0Bq9odmmY\n\nIn the video, I announced that I was in desperate need of a hair cut before Day 40. I kept putting it off so I decided to use yesterdays video as a social accountability platform. \n\nAnd....it worked. \n\nThis morning I got my hair cut ready for Day 40's after photos. In this video you'll see my hair cut...and I also discuss my leg workout.\n\nHere's the workout:\n- Squats\n- Leg Press\n- Calf Raises\n- Quad Extensions\n- More Calf Raises\n- Freestanding Sumo Squats (feel the burn)\n\nThe best part about this leg workout is that its my last one before day 40. Leg's is a favourite workout of mine because it is always a great fat burner. But your not going to burn fat without the right diet. \n\nWhich brings me to today's nutrition...\n\n...before day 40 arrives I need to \"fill out\" my muscles so they look hard for the photo. To do that i've re-introducing sweet potato at lunch and afternoon tea. \n\nAbout three days out for an body building event you will hear body builders talking about sodium depletion or dehydration. \n\nSodium depletion or dehydration is where you drink huge amounts of water 3 days out then shrink you water intake to zero one day before the competition / bodybuilding event. For me its for Day 40 photos. \n\nI strongly recommend not trying any 'magic tricks' like dehydration and sodium depletion. You have worked so hard to get to where you are...don't ruin all the hard work by playing with your hydration levels. \n\nI have got to where I am by following this program.

The 7Q allows inputs from 4 video signals, connect 2 Teradek receivers and you have a great device for Director monitoring on location.  It also includes a waveform and vector scope perfect for DIT use in the field.    Do you want to see more gear and solutions for video professionals?

And because it has so much capability, when send a traditional HD signal, we can actually take off up to four at a time. So we built this rig. \n\nWe made this little bracket. We have multiple teradek bolt receivers here, so wireless receivers. Put a couple batteries on it and look, no hands. Give this to a director as a sort of an ultimate director's monitor where they could see two cameras at once. All of our imaging tools on the Odyssey are fully functional in the multiple stream. \n\nSo if I put on the waveform monitor. I'll get two little wave forms next to each other, and now I can compare their colors so I can match out my two cameras. A lot of DITs are buying odysseys, never getting any SSDs to report anything. They just want to use it as image analysis devices, so it's very very powerful in that way.", "title": "Tech Minute:  Convergent Design Odyssey 7Q Not Just a Field Recorder", "publishedDate":

Lee is introduced to the study of martial arts as a child living in Hong Kong by his father (Ric Young); the father dreamed that a demonic armored dragon would take his son from him, and wanted young Bruce to be able to protect himself. Bruce continues his training as he grows to adulthood, and after the cocky teenaged Lee (Jason Scott Lee, no relation to Bruce) seriously injures a prominent British citizen while fighting a gang of troublemakers at a dance, he's sent to San Francisco. While working as a dishwasher, Bruce begins to study philosophy, and in time develops a personal martial arts discipline, Jeet Kune-Do, which blends Kung Fu fighting techniques with lessons gained from his philosophical research. Bruce decides to open a martial arts academy on the advice of his fianc\u00e9e Linda (Lauren Holly); Linda and Bruce encounter resistance as a mixed-race couple, especially from Linda's mother Vivian (Michael Learned), and Bruce earns the enmity of traditional Chinese martial arts experts for his new style. But after a strong showing in several public tournaments, Bruce's fighting skill and charisma attracts the attention of TV producer Bill Krieger (Robert Wagner). Bruce is cast as Kato, the karate-trained sidekick on the series The Green Hornet, and while the show is short-lived in America, it's a huge success in Asia, leading to a series of films based around Bruce's remarkable fighting skills. Sadly, shortly before the release of the film that would make him a major screen star in the United States, Enter The Dragon, a mysterious brain disorder sends Lee into a coma that soon kills him. In a tragedy with eerie timing, Bruce Lee's real-life son Brandon Lee died shortly before this film was released, the result of an accidental shooting while completing the picture The Crow.\n\n\"dragon the bruce lee story\",\"jason scott lee\",\"lauren holly\",\"john cheung\",\"sterling macer jr\",\"rob cohen\",\"clock videos\",biography,drama,\"martial arts\",\"showbiz dramas\",\"raffaella de laurentiis\",\"rick nathanson\",\"john badham\",\"hester hargett\",\"kelly breidenbach\",\"determination videos\",\"violence videos\",\"boxing ring videos\",\"bruce lee\",\"linda lee\",\"jerome sprout\",\"johnny sun\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++14694,/m/03680d,/m/0jxgny,/m/05gml8", "title": "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (7/10) Movie CLIP - 60 Second Revenge (1993) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-01T13:27:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "6EwwDuYlv5U", "description": "A time compressed video of preparing and pouring a concrete crossing over a lake spillway.

Six of his works survive, only four of which have the original melody preserved along with them; this is one of them. It is his hymn to Nemesis, goddess of retribution and righteous anger.\n\nThe Greek text reads (roughly):\nNemesis, winged tilter of the scales of life,\nDark-eyed goddess, daughter of Justice,\nThe insolent and vain things of mortals\nYou restrain with an unconquerable bridle.\nHating the fatal wantonness of human beings,\nYou drive out black envy.\nBy thine unrelenting and holy wheel\nThe murky fortune of men is turned,\n\nYou walk right behind, escaping notice,\nYou turn aside the voice of the proud.\nYou perpetually measure out life by your arm,\nAnd you always nod with a furrowed brow,\nHolding fast the yoke with your arm.\nBe gracious, blessed lawgiver,\nNemesis, winged tilter of the scales of life.\n\nWe sing to the goddess Nemesis, eternal,\nThe long wings of Victory, mighty\nAnd infallible adviser of Justice,\nThe foolish pride of mortals\nYou cast down into Tartarus with anger.\n\n[Translation by Daniel Lantz]\n\nThis video was taken at the Society's March 2014 concert.", "title": "Mesomedes - Hymn to Nemesis", "publishedDate": "2014-03-28T03:47:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Ezl1_4QtGc", "description": "Does Judaism believe in the concept of devil?", "title": "Devil and Judaism/ What do we believe?

They are associated with the closed magnetic field lines that connect magnetic regions on the solar surface. Energetic particles spinning along magnetic field lines make visible to us. Many coronal loops last for days or weeks, but most change quite rapidly. The images combine two wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light.

A cocoon is a silk 'sleeping bag' made by the caterpillar.  Inside the cocoon, over the next few days the caterpillar pupates into a pupa.  The pupa is simply the caterpillar without its skin - it literally wiggles out of its skin.\n\nThe cocoon can be cut open, the pupa removed, and the moth will emerge without problem.  Popular opinion is wrong - it doesn't need to strengthen itself with the struggle to emerge from the cocoon.

Completely blind, he was resigned to give up his life's work. But as patients kept turning up at his doorstep, Doctor Nast continued to treat them with great attention and skill.\n\nEvery day, working hard to provide the best possible care, he earned the trust of the entire community. He continued to practise medicine for decades, saving lives, establishing a clinic and delivering some 4 000 babies. \n\nDoctor Nast's unstinting commitment to keep earning his patients' trust, day after day, resonates deeply with us at Coronation.\n\nThe commercial is a beautiful homage to this true life story. The filmmakers have meticulously recreated the world of this village doctor for a truly cinematic experience, rich in authentic detail. \n\nOn this page you can view the extended version of the commercial, and watch behind the scenes footage of how we brought this portrayal of Doctor Nast to life.\n\nAt Coronation, we are inspired by his tireless quest to deserve the faith that his patients put in his abilities.

The Ministry of Health yesterday hosted a seminar on the device, which was attended by Deputy Minister of Health Dr Inlavan Keobounphanh and other invited guests.\nSTORY: Speaking at the meeting, an official from the Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion, said only four under-utilised family planning methods had been approved for use in Laos, including intrauterine devices, implants, emergency contraception and condoms. \nOfficial emphasised that the family planning programme is relatively young; its challenges include ensuring the sustainability of services and supplies, improving the quality of information-education-communication programmes to dispel misconceptions surrounding contraception, and developing novel distribution systems to reach rural populations.\nThe device consists of a long-acting reversible contraceptive implant. It is a small (4 cm long and 2 mm diameter), flexible, white plastic rod that contains 68 mg of etonogestrel, a synthetic progestogen hormone, which is placed under the skin of the arm. The hormone is released slowly into the tissue under the skin, from where it is transferred via the bloodstream to the rest of the body over a three year period.  After it is inserted it prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones that prevent ovaries from releasing eggs and by thickening cervical mucous. The implant can prevent pregnancy for up to three years. Though it protects against pregnancy, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.", "title": "Lao NEWS on LNTV: A new contraceptive implant set for use by women in Laos.23/10/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T03:55:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FI1NCCqc3g", "description": "", "title": "Ovis dalok - Dombon t\u00f6rik a di\u00f3t", "publishedDate": "2012-10-13T17:37:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FI2ikvK3sQ", "description": "kick off 2", "title": "kick off wampee", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T22:09:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FJ7F2h8sUQ", "description": "The Wall Written Application Series gives step-by-step instructions for applying vinyl lettering, vinyl decals, or vinyl wall quotes.

Major League Baseball responded to Hamels's actions \u2014 and perhaps his candid remarks, too \u2014 with a five-game suspension and an undisclosed fine Monday.\n\n\"He could have been more discreet about it or a little less honest,\" Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said before the Phillies' game Monday night against the Mets. \"Actually, the way I looked at that, baseball's going to take care of that. The way you take care of that is with the two teams on the field.\"\n\nHamels, an All-Star last year, declined to speak to reporters Monday. But he created a firestorm Sunday when he delivered a 93-mile-an-hour fastball into the small of Harper's back. Harper ran to first, advanced to third on the next at-bat, and stole home when Hamels attempted a pickoff at first base.

She grew up in Concord as the middle child in a strict Baptist family; her father was a Baptist minister. She attended Concord High School, where she was valedictorian and won eight academic awards. She was awarded an academic scholarship to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. After two years' study, she left the College and moved to New York City.\n\nDuring the 1950s she worked for the Academy Photo Offset printing house in New York's Flatiron District and lived in Greenwich Village. She started calling herself Connie, a nickname she had acquired in New York. She began writing songs and performing them for friends, accompanying herself on guitar.\n\nHer music came to the notice of animator and amateur recording engineer Gene Deitch, who had made tape recordings of artists like John Lee Hooker and Pete Seeger in the 1940s. Deitch made a number of tape recordings of Converse in the kitchen of his house in Hastings-on-Hudson in the mid-1950s. But she failed to attract any commercial interest in her music. Her only public performance was a brief television appearance in 1954 on \"The Morning Show\" on CBS with Walter Cronkite, which Deitch helped to arrange.\n\nIn 1961, she left New York for Ann Arbor, Michigan, where her brother Philip was a professor of political science at the University of Michigan. She worked in a secretarial job, and then as Managing Editor of the Journal of Conflict Resolution from 1963. Her only musical involvement continued to be playing for friends at parties.\n\nBy 1973, Connie was burnt out and depressed. Her colleagues and friends pooled their money to finance a six-months' trip to England for her. The journal, which meant so much to her, had left Michigan for Yale at the end of 1972, after being \"auctioned off\" without her knowledge. She was facing the need for major surgery.\n\nIn August 1974, she wrote a series of letters to her family and friends, talking about her intention to make a new life somewhere else. By the time the letters were delivered, she had packed her belongings in her Volkswagen Beetle and driven away, never to be heard from again.\n\nIn January 2004, Gene Deitch -- by then 80 years old and living in Prague since 1961 -- was invited by New York music historian David Garland to appear on his radio show Spinning on Air. Deitch played some of his own recordings, including one of Connie's songs, \"One by One\".\n\nTwo of Garland's listeners, Dan Dzula and David Herman, were inspired to try and put together an album of Connie's music. There were two sources: the tapes in Deitch's collection in Prague, and her brother Philip's collection of recordings which she had sent him in the 1950s. In March 2009, How Sad, How Lovely, containing 17 songs by Connie Converse, was released by Lau derette Recordings.", "title": "Connie Converse - Honeybee", "publishedDate": "2010-01-01T01:37:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FSz0--1b8w", "description": "Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, is a journey of discovering, accepting, negating and falling in love.

other scientists accused him and his colleagues of failing to grasp the basic principles of physics.\n\nDespite the sleights Prof Higgs, at the time an 34-year-old physicist at Edinburgh University, was convinced his idea was right although he never envisaged being able to prove it.\n\nYesterday, 48 years on, his radical concept was finally proved correct by an international team of physicists at the Cern laboratory using a \u00a36 billion piece of equipment designed to uncover the secrets of the Universe.\n\nAnnouncing the latest results from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, scientists from confirmed they had discovered a new particle bearing all the hallmarks of a Higgs Boson.\n\nThe Higgs Boson helps to explain how fundamental particles gain their mass - a property which allows them to bind together and form stars and planets rather than whizzing around the universe at the speed of light. \n\n\n\nProf Higgs, 83, who travelled to Switerland to witness the landmark announcement first-hand, was visibly moved as the presentation was rounded off to tumultuous applause from a wildly excited audience, some of whom had waited overnight to secure their seats.\n\nChoking back tears, he said: \"I would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement. It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.\"\n\nHis response was characteristically modest. Professor Higgs has repeatedly resisted requests for interviews and comments, insisting the limelight should be taken by the scientists who have proved that his theory is correct.\n\nHe has long been uncomfortable even having his name attached to the particle, which is the key missing cornerstone of the Standard Model of physics.\n\nThe son of a BBC sound engineer from Newcastle, he was raised in Bristol and excelled at Cotham Grammar School.\n\nDuring a school assembly he saw the name of a former pupil, the great quantum physicist P.A.M. Dirac, on an honours board and decided to read about his work. He was quickly hooked, reading as much as he could find about the subject to satisfy his curiosity.\n\nHe went on to King's College, London, where he graduated with a first class honours in 1950. He was denied a lectureship at the university, however, so became a researcher at Edinburgh University.\n\nHis \"eureka\" moment reportedly came in a flash of inspiration while on a walking trip to the Cairngorms. When one of his initial papers was rejected, he insisted the journal had clearly not understood him.\n\nUpon publication in 1964, he and his colleagues were ridiculed as young pretenders and urged to abandon their research or risk \"professional suicide\".\n\nProf Gerry Guralnik, an American researcher who published a paper on the same subject with colleagues Tom Kibble and Dick Hagen within months of Higgs, recalled a galling encounter with Werner Heisenberg, the esteemed German physicist who gave his name to the famous \"uncertainty principle\" of quantum mechanics.\n\nHe said: \"A lot of famous people told us that we were wrong. Heisenberg told me I did not understand the rules of physics, which is pretty scary if you are 26 and are worried about getting a job.\"\n\nYesterday, the scientific community was united in its praise for Prof Higgs, with some calling for him to be given a knighthood.\n\nProf Stephen Hawking said Prof Higgs deserved a Nobel Prize for his work, but admitted the discovery of the new particle had come at a cost.\n\nHe said: \"I had a bet with Gordon Kane of Michigan University that the Higgs particle wouldn't be found. It seems I have just lost $100.\"\n\nQ&A\n\nWhat has been found?\n\nBoth of the Cern teams have announced the discovery of a new particle which is consistent with theories about the Higgs Boson. Although they haven't proven it is definitely a Higgs, there is little doubt in most experts' minds that the sought-after particle has indeed been unearthed at last.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nFinding the Higgs Boson proves the existence of the Higgs Field, a force which provides fundamental particles - the building blocks of the Universe - with their mass. Without mass they would simply zip around the cosmos at the speed of light and never form into stars and planets. It is also the last missing cornerstone of the Standard Model of Physics, which explains what the Universe is composed of.\n\nWill it have any practical applications?\n\nImmediately, no. The purpose of the research was simply to uncover one of the Universe's great mysteries and further our understanding of science. But experts firmly believe it will be of paramount importance in future research which could provide new breakthroughs.", "title": "Professor Stephen Hawking Loses Higgs Boson God Particle Existence Bet", "publishedDate": "2012-07-05T05:35:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FXWD0xOJEM", "description": "~ Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zTGNAmpgmd47I2-Wh1pl82Fl8_b_9JC\n\n~ Publisher: Nintendo\n~ Title: Mario Kart 8\n~ Composer: Shiho Fuiji / Atsuko Asahi / Ryo Nagamatsu / Yasuaki Iwata\n~ Platform: Wii U\n~ Release date: 2014", "title": "Mario Kart 8 - Ice Ice Outpost - Music", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T13:05:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6FYM0a0WZ1U", "description": "\u266b Subscribe to us \u266b\n\u27a5http://goo.gl/rwdZAz\nClick \"Show more\" to find the free download link & much more!\n\n\u2714  Leave a like on the video to show your support\n\n\u266b Download Link \u266b\n\u27a5 http://bit.ly/SaturnLG\n\n\u266b Support Chill Nation \u266b\nhttps://soundcloud.com/chill-nation\nhttp://facebook.com/allchillnation\nhttp://www.instagram.com/allchillnation\nhttp://twitter.com/allchillnation\nhttp://alltrapnation.com/\n\n\u266b Support The Producer \u266b\n\u25cf https://soundcloud.com/officialsaturn\n\u25cf https://www.facebook.com/OfficialSaturn\n\u25cf https://twitter.com/OfficialSaturn\n\n\u266b Submissions \u266b\n\u27a5http://www.alltrapnation.com/chill-submission\n\u27a5http://www.alltrapnation.com/trap-submission\n\u27a5http://www.alltrapnation.com/rap-submission\n\n\u266b Apparel \u266b\n\u27a5http://trapnation.spreadshirt.com\n\n\u266b Contact \u266b\n\u27a5http://alltrapnation.com/contact\n\u27a5kai@alltrapnation.com\n\nIf you want to remove a song that you own on my channel please e-mail me ASAP, I will respond within 24 hours or less.

This is also the home of Fabricworm.com. Hi, I'm Melissa Lunden; I'm the resident seamstress here at Birch Fabrics. I teach sewing lessons here, prepare blog tutorials and sew samples of Birch's line of organic cotton. And I am here today to talk to you about sewing. Hi, now we are going to talk about how to sew an elastic waistband. I have a little sample here for a very little waist, and once you've sewn your piece or two pieces together, what you're going to do is make a casing, which is folding over the fabric once, pressing - which I already have - and then folding it over one more time, and pressing again. You're gonna have your piece of elastic, you're going your measuring - sewing gauge to figure out that my piece of elastic is half an inch, so I want to make my casing just a little bit wider than half an inch. That way there's enough room for the elastic to get in, but it won't have too much room to wiggle around. You're going to start sewing very close to the bottom fold of the casing. Back stitch a couple stitches, and then sew all the way around, rotating the fabric as you go, and making sure you don't sew the underside while you're at it. And then you're gonna want to stop sewing about an inch away from where you started and then back stitch, and then you are going to start threading your elastic. And this is what your casing looks like. And then you take your piece of elastic and a safety pin. You put your pin at the top of your elastic, and this just makes it so much easier to thread your elastic through. And so then you just kind of push and pull the safety pin and the elastic. So once you've decided that this is the right width, then you'll trim your elastic, take out your safety pin, and then take your elastic, and then with your sewing machine, back stitch - forward, back, make sure it's nice and secure. And then you'll tuck your elastic in, smooth it out, and trim your threads. And then what you'll do is you'll just finish sewing over those - that opening, stretching the fabric as you go. Back stitch - and then you can take a second to kind of smooth out the fabric. And ta-da, you're all done.", "title": "How to Sew an Elastic Waistband | Sewing Lessons", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T21:13:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Fr2q2kHi7k", "description": "This is the fifth poem in the Jam Session.

The brain activity evoked by a second set of clips was used to test the movie reconstruction algorithm. This was done by feeding 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos into the computer program so that it could predict the brain activity that each film clip would most likely evoke in each subject.  Using the new computer model, researchers were able to decode brain signals generated by the films and then reconstruct those moving images. \n\nEventually, practical applications of the technology could include a better understanding of what goes on in the minds of people who cannot communicate verbally, such as stroke victims, coma patients and people with neurodegenerative diseases. It may also lay the groundwork for brain-machine devices that would allow people with cerebral palsy or paralysis, for example, to guide computers with their minds.\n\nThe lead author of the study, published in Current Biology on September 22, 2011, is Shinji Nishimoto, a post-doctoral researcher in the laboratory of Professor Jack Gallant, neursoscientist and coauthor of the study. Other coauthors include Thomas Naselaris with UC Berkeley's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, An T.

Everyone is setting out their stall on the village green next to the post office. The Blacksmiths Arms is unveiling its new lunchtime menu and Honor Blackman has baked one hundred scones (fifty fruit, fifty cheese) for the Women's Institute stall.\nAll the Major has to do is deliver said scones to the WI stall before mid day, then he will be free to do as he pleases, whether it is sitting in the Blacksmiths beer garden for the rest of the afternoon thereby avoiding the irritations of what he calls \"a fete worse than death\" -- see what he did there? -- or sit listening to Lady Pamela Pilkington ask why a horse should be measured in hands and not feet. Or hooves. Or maybe just sulk around the study in loose robes for the rest of the day.\nBut in Leafy Northumberland, nothing is ever as easy as it looks. For one thing, the Major's Jaguar has broken down. Again. He would ask car enthusiast and sub post mistress Penny Laine to help, but alas, his pride and vanity as usual prevent him.\nAnd he has other worries. Sir Roderick Pilkington has laid a drunken bet at his club that he will not only hunt on the Major's land that very Sunday (something the Major -- the reluctant 'Lord Morpeth' has hitherto forbidden) but will capture and render as a trophy that most elusive of furry nemeses Charlie The Fox, who you may recall from the series of delicious vignettes that was \"A Thirsty Thursday At The Towers\".\nAdd to this the fact that Countess Lydia has again broken into the Towers and is set to snaffle the Major's objets d'art and put them on Ebay and that Mike has invented a cologne he calls 'Pimp Pheromones' the Major's is set to have a very average day.\nOh, and Dr Vincenza Moretti is back. With a sniper rifle. What's the worst? \nWill the Major deliver the scones (fifty cheese, fifty fruit) on time?\nWill dastardly Sir Rod finally catch Charlie The Fox?\nWill Countess Lydia make anything from Antiques Roadshow?\n\nJoin the 8th Earl Of Wansbeck and his friends for another unlikely tale from Leafy Northumberland's most unlikely showbiz country house...\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Twist-Fete-At-Towers-ebook/dp/B00EHV6X40/ref=la_B00DWZ67CA_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376908094&sr=1-2", "title": "DSCF6185", "publishedDate": "2013-08-19T11:28:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G0GAmZGkkY", "description": "Subscribe to Explosm! - http://bit.ly/13xgq7a\nRead Our Comics! - http://www.explosm.net/comics/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/explosm\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/explosm\n\nCyanide and Happiness delivers daily comics to your face-hole on www.explosm.net since 2005!", "title": "Confession - Cyanide & Happiness Shorts", "publishedDate": "2014-07-17T05:00:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G0HoU49wYA", "description": "A panorama video showing the lobby inside Harvard\u2019s Northwest\nBuilding.", "title": "Northwest Building: interior view", "publishedDate": "2014-08-11T14:31:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G0Un4GfVCY", "description": "Simple trick to improve your laptop speaker sound for windows 7", "title": "Improve laptop speaker sound or volume", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T14:45:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G0gOhUDicU", "description": "The rig and materials have been tweaked and I have submitted the rig to www.creativecrash.com from where, once it's been approved you can purchase it.\n\nThe rig can be purchased from Creative Crash\nhttp://www.creativecrash.com/maya/marketplace/character-rigs/c/urban-pacification-unit", "title": "Urban Pacification Unit: Finalised rig", "publishedDate": "2014-06-30T07:35:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G0mehmCnkk", "description": "Get your license: http://go.anki.com/license\nCheck out Anki DRIVE: http://go.anki.com/ctk\n\nIf ya liked that video, HIT that like button!\nClick Here To Subscribe! \u25ba http://bit.ly/YARckK\n\nVLOG \u25ba http://bit.ly/14KjyfL\nStreams \u25ba http://bit.ly/1911ZGK \nTwitter \u25ba http://bit.ly/Z71AgE\nFacebook \u25ba http://on.fb.me/YARpEy\nT-Shirts \u25ba http://cinnamontoastken.spreadshirt.com\n\nOutro Song - http://bit.ly/1pkgUF4 \n\u0295\u30ce\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\u30ce \ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b", "title": "Anki DRIVE True Stories: Driver's License", "publishedDate": "2014-10-18T19:21:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G1l2696lMU", "description": "Jednoduch\u00fd video-n\u00e1vod jak nalepit d\u00e1lni\u010dn\u00ed zn\u00e1mku, aby \u0161la pot\u00e9 rychle sundat.\nOdkaz na video-n\u00e1vod: http://servicemantv.com/serviceman-tv-jak-nalepit-dalnicni-znamku-aby-sla-rychle-sundat/ \nV\u00edce, podobn\u00fdch vide\u00ed: http://servicemantv.com/category/auto/\nOdkaz na projekt: http://servicemantv.com/", "title": "ServiceMan TV: Jak nalepit a sundat d\u00e1lni\u010dn\u00ed zn\u00e1mku", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T12:17:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G2A7WxKz2E", "description": "Created by Magisto - Magical Video Editor (www.magisto.com)", "title": "by Magisto", "publishedDate": "2013-02-12T04:15:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G2AjOhy29M", "description": "LIVE sto OZ Rockstage Agrinio  18/11/2010", "title": "upogeia reumata - san fws - LIVE (OZ) 18/11/2010  HD", "publishedDate": "2010-11-21T19:40:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "6G2kYi_WbII", "description": "Formula Student hei\u00dft  in Teamarbeit einen einsitzigen Formelrennwagen zu bauen, um damit bei einem Wettbewerb gegen Teams aus der ganzen Welt anzutreten.

So, first we look at the oral posture. So what's the oral posture of a native Italian speaker? It's easy to find it if you pretend you\u2019re about to trill your R's. So, and then you just hold your tongue there. The tongue is forward in the mouth and it's high and if you sign through that sounds you get an, which is sort of the Italian thinking sound. You know in American English you would say an a, which is the oral posture for American English but you pop into that Italian oral posture and it's an. \n\nAn interesting feature of an Italian is that there are no diphthongs in Italian. So there are no vowels with 2 elements like, in American English would be, in Italian. Here are some words to practice your pure vowels instead of go, I, play 2 elements, 2 elements you got 1 element. Go, I, play. Often in Italian H's are dropped so I'm so happy to see you becomes I'm so happy to see you. Try tapping or rolling your R's for a general Italian accent. So, the river is rough this time of day becomes the river is rough this time of day, the river is rough. You do a little tap of your uvula ridge, the gum ridge right behind your upper teeth. Sometimes Italian speakers will add a little vestigial schwa, so an extra a sound before a word. So instead of, do you like my new dress? You'll get something like, do you like my new dress? So you head that little a sound at the end. Start going all the way into it. Do you like my new dress? And then back off for a minute so it sounds a little more natural. The, to the E sound is a very important distinguishment. So, Italians and my Italian students will know this for sure that the, sound doesn't show up that that much in Italian. So I'm mixing it in, in American English and will become an Italian. I'm mixing it in, E. I'm mixing it in. \n\nThe T, H sound and, becomes very dentalized in the Italian accent just because of where the tongue is in the oral posture. So thick, thin, this, and that become thick, thin, this, that. The, to the, sound so in American English we'll say hat, chat, that. In Italian we might say hit, that, chat. This is a tricky 1 for Italian speakers to get this in American English that, sound. Good. So in Italian and in your Italian accent, you want to go all the way to an, good, books. So what's the musicality in Italian accent? Oh my gosh! Italian is all about musicality so just listen to some Italian speakers and you hear the music of the way they express themselves, it tells you a lot about who they are as people and it helps you to jump into the accent with your whole body, your whole spirit.", "title": "How to Do an Italian Accent | Accent Training", "publishedDate": "2013-07-26T20:12:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GKu5rulpOE", "description": "Ripping Corpse - Dreaming With The Dead - Seduction of The Innocent\n\nlyrics\nHere to tell you a twisted story\nLike back when comics were gross and gory\nBefore Dr. Wertham that righteous slime\nClaimed horror and gore led kids to crime\nAcid in the face\nNeedle in the eye\nDecapitation, dismemberment \nSicker ways to die\nAnd so the story goes\nA creep commits a crime\nSanguinary, atrocity\nA body dissected while alive\nThe vital parts then sold\nStill livid and fresh not cold\nTo make a tasty sausage \nMaking cannibals of untold \nNow there is a widow with a malignant\nRevenge for sixty cents a pound\nSeduce the innocent \nSeduce the innocent\nSeduce the innocent\nSeduce the innocent\nSEDUCE THE INNOCENT!!!!!!!", "title": "Ripping Corpse Seduction of The Innocent", "publishedDate": "2009-10-15T15:14:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GLYmnF1zDs", "description": "http://www.showhow2.com Showhow2 is world s easiest self support platform.

They are 150 m (450 ft) wide and 23 m (75 ft) high. In the winter months, the average water flow is 250 m\u00b3/s, while in the summer, the average water flow is 700 m\u00b3/s. The highest flow ever measured was 1,250 m\u00b3/s in 1965; and the lowest, 95 m\u00b3/s in 1921.The Rhine Falls were formed in the last ice age, approximately 14,000 to 17,000 years ago, by erosion- resistant rocks narrowing the riverbed. The first glacial advances created today's landforms approximately 500,000 years ago. Up to the end of the Wolstonian Stage approximately 132,000 years ago, the Rhine flowed westwards from Schaffhausen past Klettgau. This earlier riverbed later filled up with gravel.\n\nAbout 132,000 years ago the course of the river changed southwards at Schaffhausen and formed a new channel, which also filled up with gravel. Part of the Rhine today includes this ancient riverbed.\n\nDuring the W\u00fcrm glaciation, the Rhine was pushed far to the south to its present course, over a hard Late Jurassic limestone bed. As the river flowed over both the hard limetone and the easily-eroded gravel from previous glaciations, the current waterfall formed about 14,000 to 17,000 years ago. The Rheinfallfelsen, a large rock, is the remnant of the original limestone cliff flanking the former channel. The rock has eroded very little over the years because not too much sediment comes down the Rhine from Lake Constance.", "title": "Schaffhausen - Switzerland.

The sling-jaw wrasse is a protogynous hermaphrodite: changing from female to male during their life cycle. The females are either dark brown, black or yellow and the posterior part of the much larger terminal phase male is dark brown with a light grey head. Mating behavior of this species follows a lek-like system where females choose haremic males (Colin and Bell 1991). It is believed that sexual dichromatism in labroid fishes has developed as a result of male competition for females during reproduction: a more conspicuous color pattern would enhance the ability of a male to attract a mate (Robertson & Hoffman 1977). Patrolling of territories by males has been observed for fish belonging to the family Labridae (Thresher 1979). Patrolling activity involves passing close to and often interacting with each female while navigating through his entire territory. Prior to spawning the male swims above the female, circling and weaving in synchrony with her before releasing his sperm into the water column.\n\nCredits\nCinematography: Dr. Forest Rohwer\nEdited by: Neilan Kuntz\nWritten by: Neilan Kuntz\nLocation: Christmas Island, Republic of Kiribati, Central Pacific (2005)\n\nColin PR, LJ Bell (1991) Aspects of the spawning of labrid and scarid fishes (Pisces:Labroidei) at Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands with notes on other families.

It grows to 70 cm (28 in) in length and weighs up to 7 kg (15 lb) when fully grown, standing to a shoulder height of about 35--45 cm (14--18 in). It has a reddish-brown head and a tail that is 3.5--5.5 cm (1.4--2.2 in) long.\nIt has a soft, grizzled gray to brown coat and eats a wide range of plants. It has hooves with rubbery undersides, which are effective when travelling over rocky terrain. Newborns are hidden for two to three weeks, and suckle for three to four months.\nGenetic and behavioural evidence suggests Kirk's dik-dik exhibits monogamous behaviour. Genetic analysis of offspring indicates little nonpair parentage. Year-round, Kirk's dik-diks stay close within pairs, follow each other's activity patterns and spend more than half of their time with their partners, although males give no parental care to offspring. The males guard their mates closely during oestrus and over-mark all female scent. This behavior reduces the likelihood of mating attempts by other males. However, these attempts do occur on occasion. Genetic monogamy in dik-diks is probably best explained by the behavior of females: in contrast to many monogamous female birds, female dik-diks do not appear to seek to mate outside the pair-bond. However, dik-diks may be considered to be facultatively monogamous (monogamy is imposed by environmental constraints, such as lack of other partners), evidenced by the lack of parental care shown by the male partner.", "title": "Kirk's Dik-Dik", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T01:59:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GfAyrDRscQ", "description": "La toilette doit se concevoir comme un acte global, c'est-\u00e0-dire touchant toutes les dimensions de la vie de l'enfant.

People always ask me what gave you the idea and what made you create these how to plumbing videos? Coming up with the idea was easy. After many years as a plumber and servicing customers at there home I've seen a lot of people in tuff situations, people that could not afford a plumber, people that didn't have time to wait for a plumber to come to there home and make repairs, hearing horror stories of Plumbers that have rip off costumers and gave bad service, to me this was a loud cry for help. One story come to mind; A friend of mine calls me and ask, PlumberX could you do me a favor and help this older lady that I know, and go by and look at her Plumbing, she needs plumbing work really bad but she's to scared to call a plumber because of the cost, and she know that if I send you over there to check out the plumbing she can trust me as a friend recommending you, sure I said I could do that. The next day came and I went to the older lady's home she came to the door with a pleasant smile very humble. I could see it in her eye's she didn't have to say a word ( What is this going to cost ) she was very polite and courteous. Sir would you like some thing to drink and I do appreciate you coming to check out my plumbing on such short notice. No problem mam, lets see what's going on here with your plumbing. This way Sir in the kitchen. As I walk through the home I saw in the corner of my eye younger children around 3, 5 and 6 years of age running around the house I'm sure they were her Grandkids; right away I knew they also stayed there and grandmother seem to have her hands full. I would say it's safe to say that grandmother was helping raise them or she was doing it all alone. Yea I'm a softy, seeing all this going on before I even seen the plumbing problem just made me thankful of my situation and hoping that I could help her out, and maybe just for that day I could give her a chance to catch her breath and take away some of the worries she had going on. I finely made it to the kitchen sink. Here you go Sir I'll leave you alone and let you work again thank you so much in a humble voice she says. I look under the kitchen sink. WOW! That's it I said to my self. It was a chrome P-Trap that had just corroded from the bottom leaking into a large cooking pot, five minute job to replace it. I was curious. Mam How long has this been like this. Two years Sir. I ask really? Yes. Mam were have you been washing your dishes I ask. In the tube. OH! I said. Can you fix it Sir? She ask. Yes mam not a problem. For a minute I saw a little sigh of relief on her face, but she caught her self. Sir do you have any idea what this is going to cost? Yes Mam, in a low voice I said nothing mam. I didn't have to say it to loud because I didn't want it to seem as if I was doing her a big favor because I was feeling just as humble as she was; the smile and the relief on her face was more than enough for me she was really doing me a big favor, I was enjoying the idea that I was helping someone God had sent me to. Yes I know this is a small job but there are many people out there that don't realizes this and they are really scared to call a plumber.", "title": "kitchen sink drain diy re install", "publishedDate": "2010-11-25T06:45:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GfP261VuT0", "description": "", "title": "CSV Importer for Wordpress", "publishedDate": "2011-04-06T13:24:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Gg0ldcEGn4", "description": "By giving customers anytime, anywhere access to their accounts across all channels, IBM Content Manager OnDemand for Bill Presentment and Payment helps create a network of engagement that lets you connect with customers from account management to marketing and sales.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "NEW 2015 V W GOLF 7 clip", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "6Ggxp0LmA-Y", "description": "This is a very \"cooking\" version of Wild Thing", "title": "Wild Thing - Rachael Jayne & Datta Groover", "publishedDate": "2008-06-14T01:18:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GhYuOVqBnY", "description": "http://jackfoley.net\n\nHow To Be Sympathetic With Others\n\nBeing sympathetic is one of the best ways in which you can build bridges with people. By being sympathetic with people, you automatically build a bridge as the other person starts to realize that you have genuine interest in him.\n\nLook 95% of the population just think primarily of their own wants and needs. By being a person that's different, you will attract people in spades. Unfortunately when people talk of their own problems, the people who they are talking too usually switch off..\n\nYou be the one who consoles. You be the one who tries to heal, you be the one who reaches out, you be the one who helps, you be the one who feels sympathetic.

The switcher has had a history of one of the three phases failing to open.  When this happens, the isolator opens with one phase still energized.  Since the isolator isn't designed to open hot, there's no arc suppression, and the result is quite spectacular.  Because of the history of periodic failures when the switcher has been opened, a video camera had been set up to try and record the event should it happen again.  They were in luck and caught it.  The arc ends when an upstream circuit breaker is opened.  Full credit goes to Neil Brady who captured this amazing sight.

We have a focused, well-rounded curriculum to prepare our students, mind, body and spirit, for medical school.  In fact, in my opinion, students in our pre-med program have a distinct advantage being in a Christian-centered environment.  Did you know that the American Association of Medical Colleges has published a list of personal attributes required of a physician?  At the top of that list are things like \"Acts with compassion, respect, honesty and integrity,\"  \"Ability to make ethical decisions,\" and \"Willingness to advocate for one's patient.\"  These rank higher, even, than \"Being committed to early identification and treatment of diseases.\"  At FHCHS our mission of extending the healing ministry of Christ means our students receive the spiritual reinforcement that gives them an advantage in the realm of medical school.\n\nBut you have many other options for exciting, successful and rewarding careers if you graduate from FHCHS with a Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nWith a B.S. in biomedical sciences, you can go on to veterinary school.\nYou can go to dental school.\nMany of my students are headed for graduate school to become a physician's assistant. \n\nMaybe you're interested in becoming a science teacher.   You can earn a four-year bachelor's degree from this institution, go on to graduate school to earn a two-year Master's of Education degree, and you will be qualified to become a high school science teacher or even a science teacher at a community college. \n\nBut even if you are not interested in going to graduate school beyond your four-year degree, with a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences you will be qualified for entry-level positions at medical research institutions like Florida Hospital's Cancer Research Institute or Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa; you can work in a diabetes research laboratory like the Burnham Institute at Lake Nona, or you can have a rewarding career in vaccine or pharmaceutical production at some of the nation's top employers like Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer or Sanofi Aventis.\n\nYou have so many options with the B.S.B.S., but in all cases no matter what degree you choose, if you choose to make FHCHS your alma mater, I promise you, you will find yourself in one of the most rewarding, nurturing, loving and supportive college environments in the nation.", "title": "What can I do with a BS in Biomedical Sciences degree?", "publishedDate": "2011-06-30T15:38:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GqFhkt2DIs", "description": "Do you plug the drill holes in a maple tree after tapping for sap or not ? here's a look at a stick plug that's been in a tree hole for a short time.\n\nActually the stick used to plug the tree was in for 2 weeks, have a look at the colour of the stick after plugging it, Black and Brown, its like the stick is rotting fast, you can see how infection can set in and hurt the tree, after much study I've learned just to leave the hole un-plugged and the tree will heal itself naturally.\n\nThe Stick was clean when I put it in...!\n\nThey say if you plug the tap hole with a stick, its like plugging a wound on your own body with a foreign object ... So yes, it makes sense that it will take longer to heal and chance of infection or bacteria setting in, and much more stressful on the tree, it would take years for the tree to shove out that rotting stick so it could heal properly, without the stick in the hole the tree will simply close the gap and slowly heal itself over a short amount of time, so please just leave the hole alone...thanks for watching.\n\nDon't forget to click on this URL link below:\n\nU Invest.

Sj\u00e1 meira: http://eldri.reykjavik.is/Portaldata/1/Resources/umhverfissvid/myndir/skyrlsur/FloraEllidardals.pdf \n\nComfrey (also comphrey) is a common name for plants in the genus Symphytum. Comfrey species are important herbs in organic gardening. It is used as a fertilizer and as an herbal medicine. The most commonly used species is Russian comfrey Symphytum \u00d7\u2009uplandicum ,  which is a cross or hybrid of Symphytum officinale  - Common Comfrey -  and Symphytum asperum  - Rough Comfrey. Comfrey is a fast growing plant, producing huge amounts of leaf during the growing season, and hence is very nitrogen hungry. Although it will continue to grow no matter what, it will benefit from the addition of animal manure applied as a mulch, and can also be mulched with other nitrogen rich materials such as lawn clippings, and is one of the few plants that will tolerate the application of fresh urine diluted 50:50 with water, although this should not be regularly added as it may increase salt levels in the soil and have adverse effects on soil life such as worms. Mature comfrey plants can be harvested up to four or five times a year. They are ready for cutting when about 60 cm (2 feet) high, and, depending on seasonal conditions, this is usually in mid-Spring. Comfrey will rapidly regrow, and will be ready for further cutting about 5 weeks later. It is said that the best time to cut comfrey is shortly before flowering, for this is when it is at its most potent in terms of the nutrients that it offers. Comfrey can continue growing into mid-Autumn, but it is not advisable to continue taking cuttings after early Autumn in order to allow the plants to build up winter reserves. After the growing season, leaving comfrey beds fallow may deliver higher yields in future harvests, as the plant builds up energy reserves in its roots. Comfrey is a particularly valuable source of fertility to the organic gardener. It is very deep rooted and acts as a dynamic accumulator,[7] mining a host of nutrients from the soil. These are then made available through its fast-growing leaves (up to 4-5 pounds per plant per cut) which, lacking fibres, quickly break down to a thick black liquid. There is also no risk of nitrogen robbery when comfrey is dug into the soil as the C:N ratio of the leaves is lower than that of well-rotted compost. Comfrey is an excellent source of potassium, an essential plant nutrient needed for flower, seed and fruit production. Its leaves contain 2-3 times more potassium than farmyard manure, mined from deep in the subsoil, tapping into reserves that would not normally be available to plants. Comfrey as a compost activator - include comfrey in the compost heap to add nitrogen and help to heat the heap. Comfrey should not be added in quantity as it will quickly break down into a dark sludgy liquid that needs to be balanced with more fibrous, carbon-rich material. See more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfrey\n\nComfrey that grows from seeds, is NOT sterile, and will spread like wildfire. If you ever let it go to seed, you will greatly regret it! The roots can exceed 8 feet in depth.  You are far better off getting starts of Comfrey Bocking14, OR Roots, or Plants. This IS sterile, is a bunching plant, propagates via roots, and does not produce seeds. This variety should be planted where you permanently want it.

There are 24 species of bumblebees, around 225 species of solitary bee and just a single honeybee species. Bumblebees look quite different from honeybees and solitary bees. The most reliable difference is that bumblebees are usually larger, and are always covered with dense hair. You can check if you have a bumblebee by comparing the images above, but remember that not all bumblebee species have the same colours of hair or markings.\n\nThe common carder bee, Bombus pascuorum, has shaggy hair and can be seen at flowers late in the year, often into November in southern Britain. It is one of our most common bumblebee species, found even in the centres of large cities. The English colour form of this species is darker than the Scottish colour form. Find out more about the distinguishing marks, habitat and distribution of the common carder bee.

The human eyes fixate at important locations in the scene, and every fixation point lies inside a particular region of arbitrary shape and size, which can either be an entire object or a part of it. Using that fixation point as an identification marker on the object, we propose a method to segment the object of interest by finding the \"optimal\" closed contour around the fixation point in the polar space, avoiding the perennial problem of scale in the Cartesian space. The proposed segmentation process is carried out in two separate steps: First, all visual cues are combined to generate the probabilistic boundary edge map of the scene; second, in this edge map, the \"optimal\" closed contour around a given fixation point is found. Having two separate steps also makes it possible to establish a simple feedback between the mid-level cue (regions) and the low-level visual cues (edges). In fact, we propose a segmentation refinement process based on such a feedback process. Finally, our experiments show the promise of the proposed method as an automatic segmentation framework for a general purpose visual system.", "title": "MATLAB  Active Visual Segmentation", "publishedDate": "2013-02-05T11:25:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GyOohCd0-A", "description": "Fritillaria culture in Romania\ncatalin_iancu77@yahoo.com", "title": "Fritillaria Imperialis", "publishedDate": "2011-04-04T09:14:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GyYQUX5ytI", "description": "\u00a1Comparte el video con los retados!\nhttps://twitter.com/yahirmusic\nhttps://twitter.com/luisitorey\nhttps://twitter.com/jaimecamil\nhttps://twitter.com/faisirrito\n\nEstos v\u00eddeos son simple diversi\u00f3n, de hecho todos los \"famosos\" y celebridades que han participado en el mundo no s\u00f3lo se echan la cubeta, de cualquier forma aportan, el verdadero objetivo es que apoyes a esta buena causa, nosotros ya lo hicimos, ahora te toca a ti, lo que tus posibilidades te permitan, s\u00f3lo entra en e inf\u00f3rmate:\nhttp://www.alsa.org\n\nPara contrataciones y suscripciones escribe a: soyalexmontiel@gmail.com\n\u00a1Suscribete a mi Tutub!\nMi fesibut\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ElPelucheEnE...\n\nTuister: @ESCORPIONGOLDEN", "title": "ICE BUCKET TEQUILA CHALLENGE M\u00e9xico", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T02:33:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GzQ3n_ua-I", "description": "", "title": "Hardrock MMA 60 Fight 2 Zach Michael vs Nick Feeler 195", "publishedDate": "2014-02-04T23:29:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GzQkjAJtfY", "description": "The emergence of the 'One-God' concept - from Khemet.", "title": "\"Before Christ\" - [Pt. 6] Pharaoh Akhenaten - The Introduction of Monotheism", "publishedDate": "2012-10-14T01:04:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6GznhT__PXs", "description": "Waking waving arm iflateable tUbe man", "title": "Family guy Wacky waving inflatable arm flaling tube man", "publishedDate": "2011-03-09T02:30:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "6H-BHbko8v0", "description": "", "title": "ra\u00e7a rubro negra ( fla x flu )", "publishedDate": "2009-04-14T00:13:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "6H-BahAo0Xk", "description": "Find hundreds of BBQ and Smoker recipes:  http://www.myrecipes.com/barbecue-recipes/\n\nGet 5 of Jamie Purviance's favorite tips for smoking meat over a grill.\n\n1.

Whole life insurance is permanent life insurance coverage that lasts as long as you live and continue to make on time premium payments. The reason that whole life insurance quotes are so much more expensive is due to the fact that the policy will have to pay out a death benefit when you die.\n\nWhole life insurance quotes are available online from many insurance companies that have an online presence. Online life insurance quotes let you search for the policy that best suits your needs. When you log onto each site, you can read the information regarding the whole life insurance policies available and request free quotes. You should request at least three or more quotes so you can compare the different rates.\n\nWhen you compare the whole life insurance quotes you have got, the cheapest is not always the best one to choose. They can be quite affordable because the payment of premiums stretches out over a longer period of time. When you are comparing the online life insurance quotes you receive, you shouldn't just think about the amount of the monthly premium but the length of time that you have to pay the premiums.\n\nWhen comparing whole life insurance quotes there are quite a few things to think about.\n\nFor a website totally devoted to Life Insurance visit Peter's Website Life Insurance Answers and find out about Life Insurance Answers as well as Term Life Insurance and more, including Online Life Insurance and Life Insurance Agents.\n\nhttp://tiny.cc/LifeInsuranceQuotes\n\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/?expert=Peter_Crump\n\n\nHelpful Tags:\n\n----------------------------------------------\nSearches related to life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance calculator\n\nmanulife life insurance rates\n\nlife insurance quotes\n\nlife insurance companies\n\nterm life insurance rates\n\nterm life insurance\n\nlife insurance rates by age\n\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates\nterm life insurance rates\nwhole life insurance rates\nbest life insurance rates\ncompare life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates by age\nlife insurance rate\naverage life insurance rates\nbest term life insurance rates\ncheap life insurance rates\npermanent life insurance rates\nlife insurance ratings\nlife insurance rate quote\nlife insurance rate chart\nterm life insurance rate\nmortgage life insurance rates\nlife insurance rate quotes\nlife insurance company ratings\nbanner life insurance rating\nterm life insurance rates chart\nterm life insurance rates by age\nterm life insurance quotes\nlife insurance rate calculator\nlife insurance quotes\nlife insurance quote\nonline term life insurance rates\nterm life insurance\nlife insurance companies\nwhole life insurance quotes\nbest life insurance companies\nwhole life insurance\nbest life insurance\nbest term life insurance rate\ncheap life insurance\nuniversal life insurance\nlife insurance types\nlife insurance quotes online\nsenior life insurance\nlife insurance\nbest term life insurance\nterm life insurance quote\nlife insurance policies\naverage term life insurance rates\nlife insurance cost\naffordable life insurance\n20 year term life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates term\ninstant life insurance quotes\nonline life insurance rates\nlife insurance rates comparison\ntop rated life insurance companies\n--------------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/lifeinsuranceratable\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TermLifeInsuranceify\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLifeinsurancequot\n\nlife insurance rates,life insurance calculator,manulife life insurance rates,life insurance quotes,life insurance companies,term life insurance rates,term life insurance,life insurance rates by age,mortgage life insurance rates", "title": "Life Insurance Rates!

Esa - I Want To Blow Your Mind\nFrom the album 'Future Rhythm Machine' \n\nHuntleys & Palmers 2012\nhttp://huntleyspalmers.com\n\nVideo by Ling Lee: http://underkonstrukt.com/\n\nHaving brought 2011 to a close with two sell out releases ('Oh My Days' & 'Highlife') under his belt, a growing fan base which counts Ricardo Villalobos, Andrew Weatherall, Gilles Peterson, Caribou and Jackmaster amongst its members. Lining up residencies at the legendary Plastic People in London, Glasgow's Sub Club and festival appearances this summer, Auntie Flo has been on a roll! It now gives us great pleasure in presenting the Future Rhythm Machine.\n\nWhilst Future Rhythm Machine isn't a full length debut album, it is a body of work which draws on and demonstrates Auntie Flo's far flung influences which include African and Latin lessons in rhythm from the likes of Fela Kuti, William Onyeabor and Matias Aguayo, the refinery of Ricardo Villalobos and Four Tet and is charged with the instinctive energy from Kwaito and Chicago house. Also inspired by Black Atlantic diasporic culture and the writing of Kodwo Eshun, Steve Goodman (Kode 9) and Paul Gilroy.\n\nFeaturing guest vocals from sultry Chilean singer Mamacita (whose own material is forthcoming on the label) and Glasgow's favourite South African, Esa Williams. Future Rhythm Machine was actually the first piece of work we'd heard from the Auntie Flo project (it was actually the catalyst for starting the label) and despite it being an earlier incarnation to what we now present, its originality still shines through and has stood up to (many) repeated listens. With only a few straight up club tracks, we hope you enjoy listening to this at home, in the club or on the move as much as we do.\n\n\"Kodwo Eshun talks about the 'futurhythmachine' where he disputes the western futurist pre-occupation with noise in favour of rhythm - it is the rhythm machine which joins the dots between all music of the black atlantic from Afrobeat and Highlife to Techno, Soul and Hip Hop. Whilst I have always been interested in 'black music', I had less exposure to African and South American music until a few years ago, so there is still a freshness which is really exciting. I have always been drawn to the rhythm or groove of any piece of music, much more so than lyrical content for example. When I listen to African music I hear new rhythms, new possiblities and a glimpse into another world.\" Auntie Flo\nhttp://auntieflo.in", "title": "Auntie Flo feat.

As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008.\n\n\"a serious man\",\"a serious man clip\",\"a serious man trailer\",\"a serious man part 1\",\"a serious man ending\",\"michael stuhlbarg\",\"fred melamed\",\"chalk videos\",\"chalkboard videos\",\"independent comedies\",comedy,independent,\"eric fellner\",\"tim bevan\",\"ethan coen\",\"joel coen\",\"robert graf\",\"education videos\",\"faith videos\",\"fate videos\",\"classroom videos\",\"lecture hall videos\",\"prof lawrence larry gopnik\",\"sy ableman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++395678,/m/07s8hms,/m/092t0zq", "title": "A Serious Man (5/10) Movie CLIP - The Uncertainty Principle (2009) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-06-16T15:34:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "6HKK-OI33F8", "description": "This clip is part of the Career Girls ongoing series of career guidance/inspiration videos.

IT cares not for what you, or i, or anyone thinks of it. It lives and evolves on it's on - \"creeping\" through dense dark forests, sliding down cavity walls, creaking the floorboards, and rattling a few cages. THis is not something to turn your back on - it will attack. It prays on the week, swallows them hole, digests them with pure Funk power. For the strong, enjoy but do not attempt to double cross it. It will devour you. And as my man Gandalf once wisely said \"Do not stray from the path!\"if you dare, pump up the volume and remove sharp objects from the back wall. DAMN! i wish you luck.              \ndateSat, Jul 30, 2011 at 2:13 AM       the alphabet thing is a key feature. an alphabet is such an ambiguous thing. it conjures up memories of early classical minimal or system music. what does it mean? to my monolingual ear it is not an alphabet but a procession of sounds. at first it is indistinguishable as anything other than just noises, and it should be to your ears too. your emotions towards the alphabet are likely to be different to mine, but i wonder at what point it is clear to your ears that an alphabet is being delivered. and why? it is one of the first things we are taught in language, yet has no real meaning it itself, and is just a means to an end, and perhaps in the future it will lose it's necessity all together and instead be replaced by a global phonetic system. but i doubt it. alphabet is not language, it is just a method of conveying language - utterly useless on it's own, utterly beautiful when it is deciphered from a meaningless order or procession, and transformed into words, and from there into prose, lyric, or fable. so the music has this same idea.... scattered thoughts, ideas, transient, lost, meaningless? but as the track develops so do the sounds, they join, congeal, and order and structure is reached, and there is a moment when everything fits together, mumbles make sense of the alphabet and Babel is reconstructed.  but it is fleeting, and a memory is all that is left at the end. and then the alphabet, still there, still unexplained.... there is something deeply moving about this simplicity, at once totally devoid of all emotion yet somehow complete full of it. Almost as if the listener himself has to decide what those letters are for, like as an artist stares, brush in hand, and smiles at a blank canvas.         \ndateThu, Aug 11, 2011 at 1:20 PM          the end drone is supposed to be that perfect length that starts to disturb just at the same time it ends, leaving the listener elated (that it has ended when they started to think \"let it end!!!\" hope fully i've got this timing right. during the drone, sub root notes come in. they are sine waves and get totally lost in mid priced systems. i don't mind this: just something for the big systems, but maybe it could be replaced with square wave to get some harmonics in there....               \ndateThu, Aug 11, 2011 at 1:20 PM                   thankfully it's much dirtier and Grimier, than it could have been. but i think that's for the better. it's got attitude instead of being too \"sweet\" which was a risk when we first took it away from the demo's groove / melody axis. This is in part because i've added a new bass line later on in the track. it's to try and give the track a bit of kick, like the demo, but less \"funky\" and more.... hmmm.. hiphop. further reaches. a groove you stumble into, not get smacked round the head by.... you know what i mean. strangely, this one kind of works best listened to quietly on headphones, late at night. but choose you/'re own vehicle.", "title": "\u041f\u041e\u0422\u041e\u041f\u042a : \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439", "publishedDate": "2011-12-03T22:29:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6H_5UojKnco", "description": "Theres a bit of a long back story but its to long to explain.

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

The Roman senate was about to vote on terms of peace with Pyrrhus when blind old Appius Claudius spoke to them (according to Plutarch):\n\n\"Do not suppose that ye will rid yourself of this fellow by making him your friend; nay, ye will bring against you others, and they will despise you as men whom anybody can easily subdue, if Pyrrhus goes away without having been punished for his insults, but actually rewarded for them in having enabled Tarentines and Samnites to mock at Romans.\" \n\nAfter Appius said this, the Roman senators changed their minds about peace, and told Pyrrhus he must first depart out of Italy, and then, if he wanted, the Romans would talk to him about peace; but as long as he was in Italy with an army, the Romans would fight him.\n\nAnd so, closer to Rome than the first battle of Heraclea, the armies met near Asculum in 279.  There was a first day of battle where the Greek elephants and phalanx could not deploy because of the wooded terrain and high points that the Romans fled to.  But on a second day of battle, Pyrrhus occupied the high and wooded ground at dawn before any fighting began, forcing the Romans to fight him on a level plain.  There, the two lines of infantry collided, and fought an indecisive battle for hours, until Pyrrhus unleashed his elephants from reserve.  The war elephants broke the Roman lines and the Romans retreated, losing more than twice as many men as Pyrrhus.\n\nNevertheless, after the battle a legendary exchange took place between Pyrrhus and one of his officers.  The officer congratulated Pyrrhus on the day's victory.  Pyrrhus replied \"If we should win one more battle against the Romans we shall be utterly ruined.\"  Any victory gained at too great a cost may now be called a \"Pyrrhic Victory.\"", "title": "279 B.C.

It was Britain's first concentric castle, with a ring of shallow lakes surrounding it. It is one of the biggest fortresses in Europe, and the second largest in Britain, behind only Windsor Castle.\n\nKing Henry III mediated in the dispute between Llywelyn and de Clare and sent a bishop to control the fortress, but de Clare regained control of it. Luckily for him, Llywelyn fell into the subsequent king's disfavour when he failed on five occasions to provide Edward I with services demanded.\n\nLlywelyn was stripped of his lordship and Edward took his lands. Thus, de Clare's need for such a strong castle was drastically diminished and it was used instead by the family and later the Despensers as a headquarters for their operations.\n\nIts usefulness as a home and defence diminished, and by the 15th century, it was gradually vacated. Subsequent owners kept up maintenance, but this more or less petered out by the end of the century. Its eastern gatehouse was used as a prison.\n\nAfter the Civil War, in which it played little part, Oliver Cromwell decreed that the castle be slighted. The damage caused resulted in the famous 'leaning' south-east tower, which can be seen today.\n\nLike many other Welsh castles, Caerphilly fell into ever more disrepair between military use and modern conservation.\n\nIt was the Bute family who finally took the upkeep of this monumental castle upon themselves in the 18th century. The first Marquis of Bute began the work, which continued until it was handed over to the government in 1950.\n\nI thought it best to share them with you, I highly recommend visiting this Castle, if you dont normally visit Castles its still worth it! \nthanks For Watching\nI Hope You Enjoyed It\nPlease Rate Comment And Subscribe\n(c) 2014 Bumblebonce Productions\nMusic by: MachinimaSound.com", "title": "Caerphilly Castle in Pictures", "publishedDate": "2014-08-19T19:02:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "6HqGGUmjqcE", "description": "A look at an amazing play by Desmar Jackson on each camera as the Salukis faced SIU-E on December 23, 2013.", "title": "Saluki Basketball - Desmar Jackson's Behind the back, no look assist - December 23, 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-12-24T17:19:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "6HqptTKT6_Y", "description": "The Reason I Made This Is Because Of Shark Week Is Coming In August", "title": "Top 20 Prehistoric Sharks PowerPoint", "publishedDate": "2014-06-26T17:11:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "6HrGbuwuATE", "description": "rocking Goa", "title": "dil chahta hai", "publishedDate": "2007-08-07T15:32:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6HrRlsH0LPk", "description": "Meet Granny Muriel.

It does not require complicated instruments . His research work is  by collecting the unused articles around us and applying them as the no cost aid in the teaching learning process or for common man's requirements. The rubbish is  also be collected and used for manifesting the creativity and protecting the milieu. This phenomenon is implemented through an NGO namely SROSTI (Social development research organisation for science, technology and implementation) At/P.O.- Bahanaga in the District of Balasore, Odisha,India which is founded by Mihir during the year 1987.
