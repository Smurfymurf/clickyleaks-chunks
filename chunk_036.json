During the summer months, numerous spherical structures called sporocarps form on the undersides of the branches. The male sporocarp is greenish or reddish and looks like the egg mass of an insect or spider. It is two millimeters in diameter, and inside are numerous male sporangia. Male spores (microspores) are extremely small and are produced inside each microsporangium. Curiously, microspores tend to adhere in clumps called massulae.[5]\nFemale sporocarps are much smaller, containing one sporangium and one functional spore. Since an individual female spore is considerably larger than a male spore, it is termed a megaspore.\nAzolla has microscopic male and female gametophytes that develop inside the male and female spores. The female gametophyte protrudes from the megaspore and bears a small number of archegonia, each containing a single egg. The microspore forms a male gametophyte with a single antheridium which produces eight swimming sperm.[14] The barbed glochidia on the male spore clusters are assumed to cause them to cling to the female megaspores, thus facilitating fertilization.\nSee more of our clips on rice culture in our Rice Paddies in Asia Playlist", "title": "Free Nitrogenous Fertiliser from Azolla on Rice Paddies", "publishedDate": "2012-08-18T03:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1D6IUZd04i8", "description": "Vinheta curta do Canal GLIS VIDEO.", "title": "VINHETA GLIS VIDEO", "publishedDate": "2014-03-22T12:32:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1D6aaKzNVAU", "description": "George Galloway discusses Robert Capa, the Spanish Civil War (the support of the fascist powers to Franco, and the non intervention of the UK), the Red Army victory on the Nazis in WWII and D-Day.\nFrom Talksport radio show, June 6th, 2009.", "title": "George Galloway on Robert Capa, the Spanish Republic, World War II and D Day", "publishedDate": "2009-06-11T17:13:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "1D6no1pKEpg", "description": "Here is a educational news broadcast I made for class.\nIt is about the Triangle Shirt Waist Factory Fire and how the working conditions were so bad that many women died and there windows rusted shut and blocked fire escapes.

It is a reverential but humorous work, full of love for the cult of the Virgin Mary, which at that time also received attention from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux who was the leading medieval proponent of veneration of the Virgin as a counter-balance to the more rigorous Christian scholasticism, then the dominating spiritual force.\nUnlike Clairvaux's more sombre tomes, de Coincy's book (whilst sharing much of the same ideological bedrock) tends more towards the indulgent or soft-hearted. Many of the songs de Coincy wrote were set to popular ballads then in vogue at the royal court, or borrowed the tune of pastoral or romantic ditties. The Miracles of Our Lady is one of the most popular works of Marianist literature from the period and it encapsulates a very particular set of Christian values, which saw in the Virgin Mary the most benevolent and humanistic aspect of salvation, intercession and mercy. Many of the songs are concerned with the key elements of the Virgin's earthly life - her conception, her birth, her childhood, her youth in the Temple, the events recorded in the Biblical gospels and her Dormition; the poems and stories are generally more concerned with her modern-day miracles.\nOn the subject of the Virgin's interaction with the contemporary faithful, one modern historian describes de Coincy's view of Mary thus: -\n\"The more raffish the Virgin's suppliant, the better she likes him. The miracles' heroes are liars, thieves, adulterers, and fornicators, footloose students, pregnant nuns, unruly and lazy clerics, and eloping monks. On the single condition that they sing her praises, usually by reciting the Ave Maria, and show due respect for the miracle of the Incarnation wrought in her, they can do no [fundamental] wrong. Her justice is loyalty to her own: whatever his conduct, anyone pledged to her protection is her liegeman and she his responsible suzerain. Through her the whole gay crew of wanton, loving, weak humanity finds its way to Paradise...\" [1]\nIn many ways, de Coincy rejected the strict Pauline morality that would come to characterise later demoninations of Christianity, especially counter-Reformation Catholicism and Protestantism, which placed a great effort on self-denial and renunciation. In their immediate context, they were written to please de Coincy's own congregation and to present a softer form of Christianity in reaction to the hardline stance of the nearby cathedral-chapter at Beauvais, which had staged various plays savagely satirising secular pursuits as inherently wrong and damaging to one's spiritual life. This perhaps explain why de Coincy chose to express his own more liberal, Marianist views through the same exploitation of secular forms of presentation - in his case, poems and music.", "title": "Gautier de coincy: Amours qui bien ses enchanter", "publishedDate": "2009-10-24T12:07:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1D8BKKelr-8", "description": "About the Speaker: \n\nNAME: Adv.

It reaches a height of 150 ft (46 m) and catapults riders from 0 to 72 mph (116 km/h) in 2 seconds. It features a top hat and three inversions, a dual loading station and a magnetic braking system.[1] It was built to interact with three other Hersheypark rides: the Dry Gulch Railroad, the Monorail, and the Trailblazer.\n\nStorm Runner is the first accelerator coaster to utilize over-the-shoulder restraints and the first to have a dual-loading station with switch tracks. Likewise, it was also the first accelerator coaster to feature inversions; Kanonen at Liseberg was the second.\n\nWhen Storm Runner first opened in 2004, the queue line would often be extended with ropes due to the ride's popularity. In 2005, the park added an overflow queue line located next to the Trailblazer's first drop.\n\nAs the train leaves the station, it moves slow and eerily onto the launch platform. As it is rolling to its launch , a pre-recorded sound of a heart beat is heard. A voice says,\"All right riders, sit up right with your head back, hold on tight to the grab handles at all times, and keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times.\" Then they hear Storm Runner's mascot, a mustang, make a loud screaming neigh. After a few seconds, the trains rolls back as the magnetic brakes drop and riders hear a voice saying \"Now get ready, here we go\", and then the train launches from 072 mph in less than 3 seconds (just when the voice says the word \"go\"). Riders are photographed by the on-ride camera a short way down the launch track. In 2004 during the wait, riders would listen to a heart beat then a count down from five before hearing the voice. After traveling down the take-off runway and hitting a top speed of 72 MPH, the train climbs straight up the 170-foot tall \"top hat\" element providing some airtime, and back down again, 185-feet down the side of a hill leading down toward Spring Creek. The train next climbs and rolls left through the first-ever \"Cobra Loop\". The train then speeds up and into into a straight line barrel roll which then leads to the first-ever \"Flying Snake Dive\" which consists of a heartline roll followed by a half Immelman roll that makes a vertical plunge back down toward Spring Creek. The train shoots back up and to within 10-feet under the park's Monorail track, over a portion of the Trail Blazer, quickly twists to the left and to the right, then back above the treetops for one last dose of airtime. The train hits the magnetic brakes at fast speed, and then slowly glides back into the station. The duration of the ride is 40 seconds from launch to the brakes.\n\nTo launch the trains, Storm Runner utilizes a system invented by Intamin that launches the trains using hydraulics. This system is similar to blowing up a balloon and then releasing the air, but instead of using air, they use liquids. On the track there is a catch car that would hook up to the train. Once the launch occurs, the catch car pulls the train all the way down the track. Once the train reaches the end of the launch track, it releases and the ride continues by itself.\n\nThe launch track features magnetic brake fins. These slow down the car if the launch is unsuccessful (also known as a rollback). Storm Runner does not have a very tall top hat like Top Thrill Dragster and Kingda Ka, and usually does not have a problem clearing it. After a successful (although slightly rocky) first season, the ride's launch system is generally considered reliable.\n\nStorm Runner is also a coaster available for construction in the video game Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 with the Soaked! expansion pack.", "title": "Hersheypark - Ride On Storm Runner , front seat ride POV!

Caron shows how to hook up the cables for TIG. He discovered that when you change the ground to hook up the MIG, make sure you plug the TIG connection back into the positive terminal. He also learned that when you're adjusting the TIG amperage, turn the control on the torch all the way to 10 before you adjust the front panel dial. Otherwise the display won't show as it should. Caron also explains why he likes this multiprocess machine, much to his surprise .... On the sculpture he's working on, The Runner (http://www.kevincaron.com/art_detail/the_runner.html), which is made of 1/2\" plate steel at the base, then 1/4\" steel, he is able to switch from process to process as needed. The multiprocess machine lets him use the stick (arc) welder for the structural welding, then he makes a couple of changes, turns on the gas and gest out the MIG or the TIG to do the artistic welding on the outside all out of one box - he doesn't have to change machines or move them around. He's getting used to it and really enjoying it.

Furthermore, there is very little information in the literature on protozoa, so it can be difficult to identify these organisms.\nThe only notable features of the organism in this video are the long, needle-like axopods extending from the cell surface.  It probably belongs to the genus Rabdiophrys, but this group no longer belongs to the Helizoea group. It is now classified as part of the Filosea group, not Heliozoea.\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Sarcodina/Heliozoa/Rabdiophrys/index.html", "title": "\u6c34\u7530\uff1a\u7570\u7269\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u8fbc\u3080\u592a\u967d\u866bHelizoa, taking a food particle through its axopods", "publishedDate": "2013-03-05T06:00:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1DPeMElQV94", "description": "Boggart's Breakfast Border Morris perform Ragged Crow - my first Dance Out!!", "title": "Boggart's Breakfast Ragged Crow", "publishedDate": "2010-03-21T19:57:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "1DPoenIyeOw", "description": "anda minat?\ncp 02140295751 \nlokasi tangerang", "title": "proses cutting pola decal atau striping motor", "publishedDate": "2013-01-04T14:36:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1DQOtXhr76s", "description": "So, Tom and I used to post monthly videos of our duets over on his channel... but I've decided to upload one on here now that I've properly joined the land of yooooooutuuuuube.

In elementary algebra: 1 + 1 = 2 and x + x = 2x. This book gives easy to understand explanations of major differences in symbol manipulation between the two algebras.\n\"1 + 1 = 1  An  Introduction to Boolean Algebra and Switching Circuits\" was originally published by Williamsville Publishing Company as part of their popular \"Tape 'n Text\" \"Computer Math Series.\"  It has been expanded and republished  as \"Volume  4\" in the series ( www.wrparks.com ) This paperback text is intended for classroom  teachers,  students and as a reference  for libraries. Material in the \"Computer Math Series\" was submitted for review in \"The Mathematics Teacher\" and received praise - \"The development is well done.\"\nIn elementary algebra 1 + 1 equals 2. In Boolean algebra 1 + 1 equals 1. Boolean algebra is not isomorphic (similar) to elementary algebra. However, Boolean algebra is isomorphic to logic. Knowledge of Boolean algebra and logic are needed in our modern world in order to explain how computers are designed and operate at the most basic levels.\nThe three main operators in Boolean algebra and switching circuits are directly  related to logic. For example, in logic the Boolean algebra plus sign \"+\" means \"OR\" (disjunction) and the times sign \". \" means  \"AND\"  ( conjunction ) and the prime mark or tilde \"~\" means \"NOT\" (negation in logic). Logic symbols will be used mainly in volume 3, \"Introduction to Logic.\"\nIn all four volumes in the \"Computer Mathematics Series\" we are using a modified form of programmed instruction (PI). A small amount of information is presented in each frame before advancing to the next frame.

This allows farmers to save their seeds for a time when this commodity has a higher market value. This allows for safe storage of the cowpeas without the use of pesticides. In the video, which can be used on smart phones, we describe the steps needed for hermetically sealing cowpea seeds in a series of plastic bags. The two inner bags are for hermetic sealing and the outer third bag, which is made of woven material, is used to protect the inner bags from damage.

Aunque puedes estar sin esperanzas, siempre hay una forma. Siempre y cuando hagas las cosas correctas en el tiempo correcto, es casi inevitable que la recuperaras. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son las mejores formas para recuperar a tu ex novia?\nPrimero, deber\u00edas dejar de pensar en ella todo el tiempo. Ender\u00e9zate y sigue con tu vida. Vive y disfruta de la vida soltera por alg\u00fan tiempo y piensa si en realidad la quieres de regreso, o si solo te est\u00e1s sintiendo triste porque te dejo. Esto har\u00e1 que ella piense en ti, y cuando piense que ya no la necesitas a ella, ella har\u00e1 lo que sea para recuperarte. S\u00e9 que esto suena raro, pero el hombre y la mujer piensan de maneras muy diferentes.\nSegundo, deber\u00edas comportarte bien con ella. Tr\u00e1tala con respeto, pero tambi\u00e9n pon tus l\u00edmites. Ya no son una pareja y por lo tanto hay muchas cosas por las cuales ya no eres responsable. No la trates mal todo el tiempo, porque eso solo har\u00e1 que se aleje m\u00e1s. Aunque alguna parte de tu persona la odie por haber terminado contigo, tr\u00e1tala como una buena amiga.\nTercero, sal de la casa, y ve a conocer a gente nueva. Tienes que cambiar tu mentalidad de \"ella es la \u00fanica\" a \"hay muchos peces en el mar\". Tan pronto te des cuenta que hay muchas mujeres con potencial por doquier, ella notara la diferencia y empezar\u00e1 a tomar acciones para recuperarte, si eso es lo que ella quiere.

Material evolution is an effect, not a cause. This \n\nreverses the popular belief, declaring that evolution is the result of \n\nintelligence, rather than intelligence being the result of evolution! \n\nThe aim of evolution is to produce a man, who as the point of his \n\nobjective thought may completely manifest the whole idea of life, \n\nmay bring Unity to the point of particularization, finding nothing in \n\nthe Law to oppose It. The man Jesus became the Christ through a \n\ncomplete realization of the Unity of Spirit and the Absoluteness of \n\nHis word. His physical and spiritual faculties, His objective and \n\nsubjective mind, were completely poised and perfectly balanced.\n\nIt is evident if this realization took place in any other individual, his \n\nword would be manifested like wise. Because behind the word is \n\nUniversal Soul, Omnipotent Law. The Spirit is Limitless, but can \n\nonly be to us what we believe It to be. Why must we believe It is? \n\nBecause, \n\nUNTIL WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS, \n\nWE ARE BELIEVING  THAT IT IS NOT! \n\nIt is all a matter of belief, but belief is scientifically induced into a \n\nsubjective state, through conscious endeavor.\u201d \n\n(Tyreeism)-You will come to understand how God relates to your \n\nlife and how you relate to His life\n\nYou will also come to understand how He relates in your life and \n\nhow you relate in His life\n\nYou shall grasp the reality to accept=understand=learn-that \n\nGod evolves in your life and you in His \n\nYou will sale to yourself the belief in \n\nThe Principle of Evolution", "title": "How The Principle Of Evolution Applies To Your Life", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T21:56:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1E6pudEj4pc", "description": "http://.AgentMarketing.com?rs=youtube\nSingle Family - Jackson, TN\nComplete info: http://136longleafdrive.AgentMarketing.com - Emaculate Home in Longleaf Subdivision.

Tom Walters on the search for answers at a former Florida reform school rife with physical and sexual abuse, and a possible murder. University of South Florida researchers began exhuming dozens of graves at a former Panhandle reform school where horrific beatings have been reported.. The digging and work at the site of the former Dozier Boys School in Florida will continue until Tuesday. \"In these historic cases, it's really about having an accurate record and finding out what happened and knowing the truth about what happened,\" Kimmerle said of efforts at the school, which opened in 1900 and shut down two years ago for budgetary reasons.\nKimmerle said the remains of about 50 people are in the graves. Some are marked with a plain, white steel cross, and others have no markings. Robert Straley, a spokesman for the White House Boys, said the school segregated white and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held. He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn't been discovered.\n\"I think that there are at least 100 more bodies up there,\" he said. \"At some point they are going to find more bodies, I'm dead certain of that. There has to be a white graveyard on the white side.\" Among those that have pushed to allow USF to conduct the research are Florida's Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. \"My goal all along has been to help bring closure to the families who lost loved ones at Dozier. I feel great relief that the work to identify human remains is now underway,\" Bondi said through a spokeswoman. The holiday weekend's initial work is meant to ensure that the process works smoothly before researchers return to the site. The remains will be brought to Tampa to be studied. DNA obtained will be sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for analysis. The hope is that it can be matched to relatives. Ten families have contacted researchers in hopes of identifying relatives that might be buried at Dozier. If matches are found, remains will be returned to the families.", "title": "FL Dozier Reform School Horrors Boys Missing For Decades Found On School Grounds", "publishedDate": "2013-09-01T12:41:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1EIcuxXSyME", "description": "UM Konvensyen sharer Jutawan Chu Hau Ling(USM 2005-pelajar Cemerlang )", "title": "UM Konvensyen sharer Jutawan Chu Hau Ling(USM 2005-pelajar Cemerlang )", "publishedDate": "2012-03-12T03:12:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1EIsE73YLT0", "description": "Oak titmouse singing at O'Neill Regional Park.", "title": "Oak Titmouse-Calls", "publishedDate": "2013-12-31T20:24:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "1EIu0PIIosY", "description": "In Episode 2, Bob fails to learn from last year's mistakes and decides to lead and facilitate the strategic planning session.

An HSG is an x-ray that displays the interior contour of the uterus and fallopian tubes. This test is important because it can find irregularities inside the uterus that may interfere with fertility. It also allows us to see if the tubes are open so that the sperm and egg can meet. The HSG is performed by injecting a special dye through the cervix and watching the flow of the dye through the uterus and tubes on x-ray. This procedure is performed at both our Frisco location and Grapevine location by a reproductive endocrinologist.  An HSG must be performed between menstrual cycle day 6 and 10.  Since some women experience mild to moderate cramping during the procedure we recommend that patients take 2-3 ibuprofen tablets one hour before their appointment.

Katz, Alfred Hitchcock\nScreenwriter: John Michael Hayes, Cornell Woolrich\nFilm Description: Laid up with a broken leg, photojournalist L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as \"Miss Torso\" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.\n\n\"rear window\",\"rear window clip\",\"rear window part 1\",\"rear window trailer\",\"james stewart\",\"grace kelly\",\"thelma ritter\",\"raymond burr\",\"binoculars videos\",\"camera videos\",\"ring videos\",\"classic thrillers\",classics,\"crime thrillers\",mystery,\"psychological thrillers\",thriller,\"alfred hitchcock\",\"james c katz\",\"conflict videos\",\"risk videos\",\"apartment videos\",\"l b jeff jefferies\",\"lisa carol fremont\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++40584,/m/0gt3p,/m/044qx,/m/0bq1z,/m/01v2sk", "title": "Caught Snooping -

He really WAS a dog. But before I go on to the full explanation on this thing, a small announcement: I'm leaving on my class trip tomorrow mornin', so all this stuff is gonna have to wait a little. I'll be comin' back before my birthday (the 17th; drop me a hello, ok?).\n\nNOW BACK TO THE STORY: Like I said, Len is a dog. It's not a metaphor or anythin'. Rin, of course, is human. And her brother is the human Len you see near the end, who dog-Len refers to as \"the brat\". Now, dog-Len took that brat's yellow scarf as a gift for Rin, but... notice how in the illustration with a lot of Ronalds, they all wear yellow scarves? I'm guessin' human-Len having one means he was on their side, and thus had to shoot dog-Len for revealing that. Rin then shoots her traitorous brother (confirmation on this comes in the next song) and, bein' devastated by the whole thing, shoots herself next. Told you things would get complicated. But the next songs will clear up what this one introduces.\n\nNOTES:\n*More anime characters.

Recently, we caught up with Atlantic Records own Kevin Gates on the 2014 BET Hip-Hop Awards Green Carpet. Despite many Hip-Hop sites reporting that Kevin Gates and Rich Gang's own Young Thug were beefing via social media, Kevin Gates cleared the air letting us know that Thugger is his little bro and there is no beef between the two rappers. \n\nKevin Gates also spoke with us on his future. After headlining his own \"By Any Means\" tour, Gates is ready to hit the road again with Decatur Hip-Hop artist B.o.B starting in October. Kevin Gates also explained the true meaning behind his motto \"I Don't Get Tired\". Gates informed us on why his hustle differs from other artist in the music industry. When asked to explain his motto, Gates replied \" It's self explanatory, I don't get tired. I don't get tired of being focused, get money, I don't get tired\".\n\nBefore concluding the interview we also spoke to Kevin Gates about possibly working with fellow Louisiana Hip-Hop artist Boosie on a new project and new music in the future. Gates informed us that he is looking forward to working with Boosie again soon but their schedules haven't provided them time to work on anything new to date. Kevin Gates informed us that he has a bunch of new music ready to go so stay tuned for great things to come as the year 2014 concludes. \n\nThe interview was conducted by HHS1987's Eldorado.

Click here to view \"Roll Dodge\" on Maverik Film's YouTube channel and make sure to visit the Maverik Lacrosse Facebook page for the latest gear, news and updates on all Maverik athletes.\n \n\"As defenders continue to get bigger, faster and stronger, it becomes increasingly more important for midfielders and attackers to have a variety of moves in their repertoire,\" said Miller. \"The roll dodge in particular, is a move you can use all over the field, not just around the goal.  Using multiple dodges makes you less predictable and much more of a threat to the defense.\"\n\nA native of Syracuse, NY, Miller was as highly touted Division 1 Football recruit, but gained the attention of several D1 lacrosse programs after playing in the Empire State Games. While at Syracuse, the 6 foot, 200 pound midfielder won two NCAA National Championships with the Orangeman scoring 35 goals and recording 29 assists. Miller was drafted 8th overall by the Rochester Rattlers in the 2011 Major League Lacrosse draft and recorded four goals and four assists in his rookie season.\n \n\"Jovan's positive attitude, contagious personality and passion for teaching lacrosse make him someone you want to be around,\" said John Gagliardi, President and founder of Maverik Lacrosse.  \"He has done a tremendous job representing Maverik in Dallas and is quickly becoming a fixture in the lacrosse community.  We are proud to have him as a member of our team.\"", "title": "Maverik University :: Rollback Dodge with Jovan Miller", "publishedDate": "2012-03-26T21:31:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1FZzRpoWk3w", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "Late night belly ache :(", "publishedDate": "2013-08-16T07:12:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "1F_be6T5aKE", "description": "En La Gavia encontrar\u00e1s m\u00e1s de 160 tiendas con la mejor oferta de moda, ocio y restauraci\u00f3n.

Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and quiet eruptions, although there are some with collapsed craters called calderas. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3 mi).[2]\nStratovolcanoes are sometimes called \"composite volcanoes\" because of their composite layered structure built up from sequential outpourings of eruptive materials. They are among the most common types of volcanoes, in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes. Two famous stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa, best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 and Vesuvius, famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD. Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives.\nContents  [hide] \n1 Creation\n2 Hazards\n2.1 Ash\n2.2 Mudflows\n2.3 Volcanic bombs\n2.4 Lava\n3 Climatic effects\n4 See also\n5 References\nCreation[edit]\n\n\n\nCutaway diagram of subduction zone and an associated stratovolcano\nStratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (Continental Arc Volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, central Andes) or another oceanic plate (Island arc Volcanism, e.g. Japan, Aleutian Islands). The magma that forms stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust, is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed \"dewatering,\" and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths. The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition (see Classification of igneous rock). When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a magma chamber under or within the volcano. There, the relatively low pressure allows water and other volatiles (mainly CO2, SO2, Cl2, and H2O) dissolved in the magma to escape from solution, as occurs when a bottle of carbonated water is opened, releasing CO2. Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates, the obstacle (rock blockage) of the volcanic cone is overcome, leading to a sudden explosive eruption.[citation needed]\nHazards[edit]\n\n\n\nCutaway diagram of a composite volcano\nIn recorded history, explosive eruptions at subduction zone (convergent-boundary) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations.[3] Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, typically erupt with explosive force: the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain in the pasty magma. Following the breaching of the magma chamber, the magma degasses explosively. Such an explosive process can be likened to shaking a bottle of carbonated water vigorously, and then quickly removing the cap. The shaking action nucleates the dissolution of CO2 from the liquid as bubbles, increasing the internal volume. The gases and water gush out with speed and force.[3]\nSince the year AD. 1600, nearly 300,000 people have been killed by volcanic eruptions.[3] Most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and mudflows, deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes. Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving, avalanche-like, ground-hugging incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris, ash, and gases that can travel at", "title": "The most famous composite and strato volcanoes .

The bill is pointed and black with some blue-gray at the base of the lower mandible (Howell and Webb 1995). The adult male of the nominate subspecies has chestnut on the underparts, shoulder, and rump, with the rest of the plumage black. In the subspecies I. s. fuertesi, the chestnut is replaced with ochre (Howell and Webb 1995). The adult female and the juvenile of both subspecies have olive-green on the upper parts and yellowish on the breast and belly. All adults have pointed bills and white wing bars. (Orchard Orioles are considered to be adults after their second year.)

The 20 amino acids that are found within proteins convey a vast array of chemical versatility. The precise amino acid content, and the sequence of those amino acids, of a specific protein, is determined by the sequence of the bases in the gene that encodes that protein. The chemical properties of the amino acids of proteins determine the biological activity of the protein. Proteins not only catalyze all (or most) of the reactions in living cells, they control virtually all cellular process. In addition, proteins contain within their amino acid sequences the necessary information to determine how that protein will fold into a three dimensional structure, and the stability of the resulting structure. The field of protein folding and stability has been a critically important area of research for years, and remains today one of the great unsolved mysteries.

When we say \"Kiev Nazis\" or \"fascists from Western Ukraine,\" we mean the same thing. \nNamely, people who are obsessed with Hitler about the superiority of one race or nation over others. \nIn Western Ukrainian fascists (Nazis) has its heroes. This is Bandera, Shukhevych who were servants of Hitler in World War II.\nSo..There is a war between the Russians, the local population that lives here 1000 years  and the Nazi government in Kiev, which the United States led to power. \nAs a result of the bloody coup, the Nazis from Western Ukraine came to power. \nThey are a minority, and in the case of democratic elections, they would never have come to power. Then the United States made a bloody coup, as they are able to do it all over the world. \nThus, the United States went to war against the Russian population of the South and East of Ukraine, who lived here 1,000 years and no where to go will not, of course.\n\nI'd like to work for the Russian government, but do not work. \nAnd actually just want to help as best I can. To bring the truth to the world. Free of charge and at the expense of their own time.\n\nI do not know about a help from Russia. Maybe it goes. Also, do not know, maybe go help with the West for Kiev. \nWhat else? \nRussian Donbas really fighting against fascism! The Nazis came to power in Kiev seriously consider themselves a superior race. It's funny to hear for non-Ukrainians. But it is. Ukrainians in fact it is Russians. Western historians only in the 20th century had called their - \"Ukrainians\" .\nUkrainians do not fight against the Donbas, almost. Basically, fighting Nazis from western Ukraine.\n\nIn Donbass no Russian army. Here are fighting Russian who live here 1,000 years.\nThe first Russian state Kievan Rus was here.\n They are the locals. And, of course, volunteers from around the world help us!  \nThe State Dept. United States began the war , who arranged the illegal coup in Kiev.\nAnd he led the Ukrain. Nazis to power.\nPutin does not want the new lands, otherwise  would have long ago captured the whole of the Ukraine, easy! \nThe Kiev Nazis commit genocide! \nAsk if something is unclear, I will answer.\nWar in Ukraine\nDer Krieg in der Ukraine\nLa guerra en Ucrania\nLa guerre en Ukraine\nA guerra na Ucr\u00e2nia\n\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0648\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\nWar in Donbas New Russia Resistance Army Paul Gubarev september 2014, oktober 2014, december 2014, 21, 25, 26, 30.

Es gibt kleine, flechtenartig wachsende Tillandsia bis hin zu sehr gro\u00dfen Pflanzen mit imposanten Blattrosetten. Der nat\u00fcrliche Lebensraum einer Tillandsia reicht vom Regenwald bis zur W\u00fcste.\n\nTillandsien eignen sich gut f\u00fcr Epiphytenst\u00e4mme\nDie in Wohnungen kultivierten Tillandsia bilden nur wenige oder gar keine Wurzeln und decken ihren Wasser- und N\u00e4hrstoffbedarf vorwiegend \u00fcber ihre Bl\u00e4tter. Aus diesem Grund eignen sich diese Pflanzen sehr gut f\u00fcr dekorative Epiphytenst\u00e4mme.\n\nTillandsia cyanea bildet zahlreiche 30 bis 45 cm lange und etwa 1 bis 2 cm breite Bl\u00e4tter. Diese sind in einer lockeren Rosette angeordnet, schmalw\u00fcchsig und zum Ende hin spitz zulaufend. Die blaugr\u00fcn gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00e4tter bilden auf der Unterseite r\u00f6tlichbraun gef\u00e4rbte L\u00e4ngsstreifen. Aus der Mitte einer reifen Rosette entw\u00e4chst ein 5 bis 9  cm langer Bl\u00fctenschaft, dieser tr\u00e4gt einen Bl\u00fctenstand mit 10 bis 18 cm L\u00e4nge und etwa 5 cm Breite. Der aus zahlreichen glatten, sich \u00fcberlappenden, rosafarbenen Hochbl\u00e4ttern bestehende Bl\u00fctenstand h\u00e4lt sich etwa 2 1/2 Monate. Die Bl\u00fcten bilden sich einzeln in den von den Hochbl\u00e4ttern am Rand der Bl\u00fcten\u00e4hre gebildeten Zwischenr\u00e4ume. Die Einzelbl\u00fcte ist r\u00f6hrenf\u00f6rmig und besteht aus 3 zum Rand hin flach ausgebreiteten Blumenbl\u00e4ttern. Die Bl\u00fctenfarbe ist violett-blau. Wie bei fast allen Bromelien bl\u00fcht die Blattrosette nur einmal und stirbt dann langsam ab. In den Blattachseln entwickeln sich Seitensprosse, die man zur Vermehrung benutzen kann.\n\nTillandsia lindenii sieht der Tillandsia cyanea sehr \u00e4hnlich, ihr Bl\u00fctenschaft kann ist mit bis zu 30 cm jedoch wesentlich l\u00e4nger. Die Farbe der Bl\u00fcten dieser Tillandsia ist ein kr\u00e4ftiges Enzianblau. Der Schlund einer Bl\u00fcte ist wei\u00df.\n\nTillandsia usneoides bildet fadenf\u00f6rmige Triebe mit kleinen, aschgrau gef\u00e4rbten, wie Schuppen aussehenden Bl\u00e4ttern. In der Natur h\u00e4ngen diese fast wurzellosen Pflanzen wie lange B\u00e4rte von B\u00e4umen und Felsen herab. Tillandsia usneoides kann wegen dieses besonderen Wuchses nicht in T\u00f6pfe gepflanzt werden. Man bindet die Pflanzen locker an ein St\u00fcck Kork oder Rinde und h\u00e4ngt sie an einem Haken vor einem Fenster auf. Die sehr kleinen, gr\u00fcnlichgelb gef\u00e4rbten Bl\u00fctenbilden sich in Wohnungskultur nur sehr selten.\nPflege und Kulturanleitung der Tillandsia\nLicht / Standort\n\nAm besten kultiviert man eine Tillandsia an einem hellen, teilsonnigen Standort. F\u00fcr eine gesunde und vitale Entwicklung der Tillandsia  sind einige Stunden milder Morgen- oder Abendsonne vorteilhaft. Die pralle Mittagssonne sollte abgeschattet werden.\nGie\u00dfen\n\nDie Tillandsia nehmen nur sehr wenig Wasser \u00fcber die schlecht entwickelten Wurzeln auf. Tillandsia cyanea und Tillandsia lindenii ben\u00f6tigen zudem nur sehr wenig Wasser. Wenn man die Bl\u00e4tter regelm\u00e4\u00dfig bespr\u00fcht, bekommt die Pflanze auch ausreichend Feuchtigkeit in die Erde.\n\nTillandsia usneoides wird zusammen mit der Unterlage einmal pro Woche zehn Minuten lang in Wasser getaucht. Falls man die Pflanzen auf gr\u00f6\u00dferen Epiphytenst\u00e4mmen kultiviert, spr\u00fcht man das Wurzelwerk der Tillandsia usneoides einmal w\u00f6chentlich kr\u00e4ftig ein.\nTemperatur\n\nAb Temperaturen von etwa 16 \u00b0C wachsen die Tillandsia ganzj\u00e4hrig. Temperaturen unter etwa 12 \u00b0C werden von diesen Bromelien nicht vertragen. Zur Erh\u00f6hung der Luftfeuchtigkeit bespr\u00fcht man die Bromeliein zwei bis dreimal pro Woche mit weichem, kalkfreiem Wasser.\n\nTillandsia usneoides wird einmal pro Tag bespr\u00fcht.\nVermehren der Pflanze\n\nTillandsia  cyanea und Tillandsia  lindenii kann man zu jeder Jahreszeit durch sich bildende Seitensprosse vermehren. Diese werden von der Mutterpflanze abgetrennt, sobald deren Bl\u00e4tter eine L\u00e4nge von etwa 10 cm erreicht haben. Die Kindel topft man in ein Gemisch aus gleichen Teilen Torf und scharfem Sand. Dann h\u00fcllt man das Pflanzgef\u00e4\u00df in einen Plastikbeutel. Die Abdeckung wird nach der erfolgreichen Bewurzelung entfernt und die so vermehrten Tillandsia k\u00f6nnen wie gro\u00dfe Exemplare weiterkultiviert werden. Nach etwa einem halben Jahr topft man die Pflanzen dann in normale Bromelienerde.\n\nTillandsia  usneoides wird durch abgenommene Triebe vermehrt, die man an einem St\u00fcck Kork oder Rinde festbindet.\nErde / Substrat\n\nBromelien ben\u00f6tigen eine praktisch kalkfreie Erde. Diese sollte au\u00dferdem locker und etwas kr\u00fcmelig sein. Eine f\u00fcr Bromelien gute Mischung besteht aus jeweils gleichen Teilen Torf und Lauberde. Der Torf kann auch durch kalkfreie mineralische Erde auf Kompostbasis ersetzt werden.  Bei aufgebundenen Tillandsien umwickelt man die sp\u00e4rlichen Wurzeln mit Spaghnum und befestig dieses mit etwas Bindedraht.", "title": "Tillandsia, Bromelien", "publishedDate": "2014-08-09T22:56:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GEFhtTS_k4", "description": "Primer sencillo del segundo disco de We Are The Grand\nWe Are The Grand's first single of their upcoming second album\n\n-\n\nRealizado por La Tostadora Clip en Llanquihue, Chile\n\nDirecci\u00f3n y Dir. de Fotograf\u00eda: Lorenzo De la Maza\nProducci\u00f3n: Felipe Mundaca\nDireci\u00f3n de arte y Post producci\u00f3n de video: \u00c1ngela Jarpa\nMaquillaje y FX: Pam Jerez\nActor: Rodrigo Torres\nActriz: Celia Solis\nGrip: \u00c1lvaro Araneda\nProductor Comercial: Nicol\u00e1s Benavente\n\n-\n\nSOY\n\nPlumas que volaron y quedaron en mi piel\nSon las que alg\u00fan d\u00eda me ense\u00f1aron que hacer\n\nAh me doy cuenta de quien soy\nAh en los sue\u00f1os me despiertas y no es hoy\n\nLargo es el camino para lograr entender\nQue tu estas conmigo y no te puedo sostener\nDime si es muy tarde para hacerte descender\nNo tengo la fuerza solo quiero creer\n\nAh me doy cuenta de quien soy\nAh apareces donde voy\nLa manera mas amarga de decir adios\nAh en los sue\u00f1os me despiertas y no es hoy\n\nY no es hoy\n\nDime si es muy tarde para hacerte descender\nNo tengo la fuerza solo quiero creer\n\nAh me doy cuenta de quien soy\nAh apareces donde voy\nLa manera mas amarga de decir adios\nAh en los sue\u00f1os me despiertas \n\nY no es hoy\n\n-", "title": "We Are The Grand - Soy (Video Oficial)", "publishedDate": "2014-11-17T21:57:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GFNImQ8dpU", "description": "http://www.capitolnewsonline.com | http://www.capitolnewsgy.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/wrhmnews\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CapitolNewsGY", "title": "Former Presidential Adviser on the Environment dead", "publishedDate": "2014-10-29T13:57:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GFPnP4q_QQ", "description": "", "title": "Conn's", "publishedDate": "2014-09-14T15:23:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GFXDYPRx0k", "description": "Taken from 'Memoryhouse'\n\nAvailable at:\nFatCat webstore: http://bit.ly/14gGYYF\niTunes: http://bit.ly/11rpOXf\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/18O6d5B\n\nhttp://www.maxrichtermusic.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Max-Richter/285056078942\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/maxrichtermusic\nhttp://soundcloud.com/max-richter\nhttp://www.myspace.com/maxrichtermusic", "title": "Max Richter - Embers", "publishedDate": "2012-05-01T10:25:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GFagTxH4I4", "description": "Video footage of three-time Olympian Reese Hoffa (Lakeside/UGA) practicing shot put for the upcoming London Games and an interview with his long-time throwing coach Don Babbitt.", "title": "Reese Hoffa/Don Babbitt", "publishedDate": "2012-07-05T19:49:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GGGAnS_gaM", "description": "Spider doing his thing with marleen at the old rectory.", "title": "spider @ The Old Rectory Fenagh.", "publishedDate": "2013-08-06T17:17:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GGjEagUim0", "description": "Thank you for watching!

The Pantanal is the world's largest freshwater wetland and in recent years it has become increasingly threatened by large development programmes and changes in land management practices. Since 2005, the RZSS Pantanal Conservation and Research initiative has been conducting scientific research to create, implement and evaluate conservation actions and sustainable land management strategies. Results from the Pantanal are used to promote conservation throughout Brazil and internationally.\n\nIn partnership with IPE (Institute for Ecological Research) RZSS, as well as North American and European zoos, participates in the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project which is a long term ecological study on the secretive giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) about which virtually nothing is known.\n\nAfter almost two years of preparation the Pantanal Giant Armadillo project started in June 2011. This is currently the only project in the world to be focused on this species.  Although giant armadillos range over much of South America almost nothing is known about them and most information is anecdotal. Due to its cryptic behaviour and low population densities, this animal is very rarely seen. The giant armadillo is currently classified as Vulnerable (A2cd) by the IUCN/SSC Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe main goal of the project is to investigate the ecology and biology of the species and understand its function in the ecosystem using radio transmitters, camera traps, burrow surveys, resource monitoring, resource mapping and interviews.  In 2011 from June to December five giant armadillos were captured.  Because the species is so rare, it is very very difficult to find. \n\nThe project is integrating its findings into local and National initiatives. At the end of 2012 the first steps to evaluate and use data to assess the status of giant armadillos according to the IUCN/SCC red list criteria will be taken. Data will also be compiled for population viability analysis. \n\nRZSS work on many different fronts in Brazilian, the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project being one of them.

These ADHD guidelines will help you decide if a checkup is in order.\n\n\nStep 1: Note their attention span\nNote their capacity for concentrating. Most young children have short attention spans, but those with ADHD don't seem to be listening even when they're spoken to. They frequently lose things; have difficult following instructions; and often make careless mistakes. \n\nStep 2: Rate their hyperactivity\nRecognize if their energy level seems excessive, even for a child. Are they unable to sit without fidgeting? Do they get in trouble at school for leaving their seat, or running and climbing excessively or inappropriately? Do they talk incessantly? Interrupt constantly? \n\nTip\nSome children are more inattentive than hyperactive, and vice versa. Girls are more likely to have more attention problems, while boys more often fall into the hyperactive category. \n\nStep 3: Think how long it's lasted\nConsider how long the behavior has been going on. If you've observed symptoms for more than six months, it might be ADHD.\n\nStep 4: Consider where it occurs\nNote where their behavior takes place. If it's only at home, or only at school, something other than ADHD may be to blame for their symptoms. \n\nStep 5: Gauge the seriousness\nGauge the seriousness of the problem. Children with ADHD are regularly disruptive at school and at home. Their behavior causes problems in their relationships with both adults and other children. \n\nStep 6: See the doctor\nIf you recognize any of these symptoms in your child, take them to your pediatrician. It's important that they have a medical checkup to rule out other causes for their behavior before ADHD is diagnosed. \n\nDid You Know?\nChildren whose mothers had smoked while pregnant were more than twice as likely to have ADHD as children whose mothers did not smoke.", "title": "How to Recognize ADHD Symptoms in Children", "publishedDate": "2010-10-07T14:46:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GJ4h7OStwM", "description": "Redbull BC One Cypher Korea\nBlue | Extreme Crew\nvs\nSkim | Jinjo Crew\n\nWinner : Skim\n\n\nMenu: http://youtu.be/du7pBKOlXmE", "title": "Blue vs Skim | Top 16 | Red Bull BC One Cypher Korea | STRIFE.TV", "publishedDate": "2012-06-03T05:03:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GJc8R1DN8s", "description": "http://www.goldenharmonykungfu.com/\nRichard Wong demonstrating Evasive Fist - Golden Harmony Mantis form as taught by Sifu Rupert Harvey @ Golden Harmony Kung Fu Club, Toronto, Canada.", "title": "Evasive Fist - Kung Fu Form", "publishedDate": "2007-03-26T16:01:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GJjh-O6yJg", "description": "Interline\u00ae9001's composition with its tight structural network and smooth, near impermeable surface means it is easy to clean, cutting cleaning times by up to 70% compared with conventional epoxy phenolic coatings.", "title": "Interline\u00ae9001 performance versus Typical Epoxy Phenolic", "publishedDate": "2014-02-27T14:30:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GK2Gc18xgc", "description": "Comics History 101: It's time for a Marvel history lesson!

Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the heaviest and longest, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia and the second longest, the wels catfish of Eurasia, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels; members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. Catfish are   Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another.[4] Catfish are most diverse in tropical South America, North America, Africa, and Asia.[5] More than half of all catfish species live in the Americas. They are the only ostariophysans that have entered freshwater habitats in Madagascar, Australia, and New Guinea.[6]\n\nThey are found in freshwater environments, though most inhabit shallow, running water.[6] Representatives of at least eight families are hypogean (live underground) with three families that are also troglobitic (inhabiting caves).[7][8] One such species is Phreatobius cisternarum, known to live underground in phreatic habitats.[9] Numerous species from the families Ariidae and Plotosidae, and a few species from among the Aspredinidae and Bagridae, are found in salt water.[10][11]\n\nIn the United States, catfish species may be known by a variety of slang names, such as \"mud cat\", \"polliwogs\", or \"chuckleheads\".[12] These nicknames are not standardized, so one area may call a bullhead catfish by the nickname \"chucklehead\", while in another state or region, that nickname refers to the blue catfish. Most catfish are bottom feeders. In general, they are negatively buoyant, which means that they will usually sink rather than float due to a reduced gas bladder and a heavy, bony head.[6] Catfish have a variety of body shapes, though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened ventrum to allow for benthic feeding.[6]\n\nA flattened head allows for digging through the substrate as well as perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Most have a mouth that can expand to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey.[6] However, some families, notably Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth that allows them to fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.[6]\n\nCatfish may have up to four pairs of barbels: nasal, maxillary (on each side of mouth), and two pairs of chin barbels, even though pairs of barbels may be absent depending on the species. Catfish also have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they \"taste\" anything they touch and \"smell\" any chemicals in the water. \"In catfish, gustation plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food\".[13] Because their barbels and chemoreception are more important in detecting food, the eyes on catfish are generally small. Like other ostariophysans, they are characterized by the presence of a Weberian apparatus.[4] Their well-developed Weberian apparatus and reduced gas bladder allow for improved hearing as well as sound production.[6]", "title": "PART 0034 2010 BEST BEST OF cruisinwithkenny COLORADO  LIVING IN MY TRUCK ON THE Continental Divide", "publishedDate": "2013-10-05T01:14:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GaKRffPp7w", "description": "In this stop-motion film, an Elf Magic elf magically appears from the North Pole ready to be\u00a0held and loved -- and to turn his playful thoughts into late\u2010night adventures.\n\nLearn more at http://www.Elf-Magic.com!", "title": "\"Making Mischief\" by Elf Magic\u2122", "publishedDate": "2009-11-03T23:58:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1GaKaGwch0U", "description": "Available on iTunes - http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/gang-fight-single/id428350648\n\nShirts now available at http://badlipreading.spreadshirt.com\n\nLyrics are below (but you can also turn on the captions by clicking the CC button below the video.)\n\nGANG FIGHT\n\nDefinite I'm planning on making war\nGotta beat those kids no doubt, and I\nGotta poo at the house, here we go, let's leave\nIf I think that's it's time I should go I could say\n\"Oy-ee-Oy\" gotta bring my chicken\nYeah, I know that sounds kinda messed up\nGonna get you with my pleasant Nazis, am I right?\n(Hey guys!

There is no known cure, and most children with the condition usually die around age 13.\n\nHegi, who lived in Coalhurst about 200 kilometres southeast of Calgary, was admitted to a Lethbridge hospital on Friday. She died on Tuesday, one month before her 18th birthday and three weeks before her high school graduation.\n\nBut friends at Coalhurst High School said it wasn't Hegi's condition that made her stand out.\n\n\"When you talked to Ashley, you didn't think about her being sick; you just thought about how wonderful she was,\" said friend Lais Morrow on Thursday. \"I don't know how she'd gone through everything she'd gone through and not been bitter at all, like that we ever saw at least.\"\n\nHegi made it her mission to teach the world about her condition by appearing in documentaries and media reports. Her mother, Lori, also maintained a web page that followed their lives.\n\nAt 14, Hegi reached out to others with progeria in a YouTube video, in which she advised them, \"When somebody stares at you, don't let it bother you because maybe they don't know about progeria. You can tell those people about progeria. Maybe they'll understand. And if they don't, it's OK. You're one of a kind.\"\n\nTeacher Deb Woodcock likes to borrow a saying that one of her colleagues coined to describe Hegi:\n\n\"She had a four-foot stature and a 10-foot attitude. And that just summed her up.\n\n\"She taught us far more than we ever taught her, just as far as the amount she was facing in her life and how she just took it all in stride, and the rest of us kind of struggled through our struggles, and if we put it all in perspective, we learned a lot from her.\"\n\nHegi volunteered at an animal hospital and was a season ticket-holder for the Lethbridge Hurricanes hockey team.\n\n\"The thing about Ashley is, [she had] no time for a pity party. She lived life to the fullest,\" said the team's general manager, Roy Stasiuk.\n\nA funeral service will be held Saturday at the Evangelical Free Church in Lethbridge.

I usually gain access to the river where it crosses I45.  Another  access point is behind the Magnolia Bend subdivision.  (caution: do not cross private land without permission from the land owner)\n\nThe size of the petrified wood varies, with some pieces being less than one-inch long, while others are  up to 8-inches long.  Colors are mostly black or brown, some being white, yellow or orange.  Based on geological information, this wood is from the Pleistocene to Eocene periods, making it 3 to 40 million years old.\n\nIn addition to petrified wood, white quartz, pink quartz, red jasper, and black jasper may be found in the river.  Some of these stones take a nice polish when tumbled.   \n\nIt is easy to tell petrified wood from real wood.   Although they both look similar, petrified wood  is heavy and doesn't float.  The petrification process starts when wood is buried in mud, sand or volcanic ash.  Water then penetrates the decaying wood cells, filling them with matter.  Eventually the wood becomes solid stone.\n\nOver the years a number of informative articles about petrified wood have been written.

If your pond is algae-ridden, use the lower number in the range. \n\nTie the bag in an area of the pond where there is water movement. The bag will float at first then sink.\n\nKeep it submerged about two-three feet below the surface of the fish pond.\n\nAs the barley pond straw reacts with the sun and water movement, it will begin to break down and produce low levels of hydrogen peroxide which will clean up your fish pond without endangering your fish or upsetting the fragile ecosystem.\n\nBe patient with this natural process because it takes about three to six weeks to work.\n\nKeep extra pond straw on hand, so you can switch it as needed. \n\nYou care enough about your koi fish to find a natural solution, so go the extra mile and make sure that the pond straw is one hundred percent certified organic. This ensures you're not putting any chemicals into your pond.\n\nSo now that you know how to clean your fish pond using pond straw, click on the link to find out where you can purchase a product that is completely natural.
