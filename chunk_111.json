Disinclined to embrace any particular ideology outside of a hatred for Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), the leader of the council that governs the walled city, hyper-sexualized assassin Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) seeks to bring about a revolution. Retaining the title character's trademark jet-black hair and sleek, revealing clothing, this film adaptation fleshes out the story behind the sexual and romantic tension between Aeon and Trevor.\n\n\"aeon flux\",\"aeon flux clip\",\"aeon flux trailer\",\"aeon flux part 1\",\"aeon flux cartoon\",\"charlize theron\",\"karyn kusama\",\"glass videos\",\"water videos\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"tom rosenberg\",\"gale anne hurd\",\"van toffler\",\"gary lucchesi\",\"gregory goodman\",\"henning molfenter\",\"charlie woebcken\",\"david gale\",\"martha griffin\",\"aggression videos\",\"survival videos\",\"prison videos\",\"on flux\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++304590,/m/01l9p", "title": "Aeon Flux (4/10) Movie CLIP - Jailbreak (2005) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-22T13:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zIsD9ddVKE", "description": "Firefighters set a house on fire in Enderby as a practice.", "title": "Enderby House Fire", "publishedDate": "2014-07-11T17:16:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zItMnHE8Rg", "description": "", "title": "salamandra esperar", "publishedDate": "2010-02-12T17:05:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zJ5MO5M8Uw", "description": "Fabricating/Welding Position at National Storm Shelters\nQualifications: \nAt least 5 years of Welding Experience\nWorking Knowledge of Welding Equipment and Ability to MIG & TIG\nProficient in reading Blue Prints and Specified Tolerances\nMaintenance/repair experience is a plus\nSelf-Motivated and Results Oriented\nGoal orientated and Willingness to Grow\nA TEAM PLAYER\nBenefits and Salary:\nCompetitive Salary\nCompetitive Benefits Package (Health, Dental, and Life Insurance)\nRetirement Plan (SIP)\nHoliday Pay\nContinuous Training of Industry Standards\nBrand new location and shop area\nA great group of people to work with!\n\n\nNational Storm Shelters, LLC is located in the heart of Middle Tennessee.

Vernor Vinge speaks about technological change, offloading cognition from minds into the environment, and the potential of Strong Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\" - \"The Coming Technological Singularity\" by Vernor Vinge, 1993\n\nVernor Vinge popularised and coined the term \"Technological Singularity\" in his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\", in which he argues that the creation of superhuman artificial intelligence will mark the point at which \"the human era will be ended,\" such that no current models of reality are sufficient to predict beyond it.\n\nVinge published his first short story, \"Bookworm, Run!\", in the March 1966 issue of Analog Science Fiction, then edited by John W. Campbell. The story explores the theme of artificially augmented intelligence by connecting the brain directly to computerised data sources. He became a moderately prolific contributor to SF magazines in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1969, he expanded two related stories, (\"The Barbarian Princess\", Analog, 1966 and \"Grimm's Story\", Orbit 4, 1968) into his first novel, Grimm's World. His second novel, The Witling, was published in 1975.\n\nVinge came to prominence in 1981 with his novella True Names, perhaps the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of cyberspace, which would later be central to cyberpunk stories by William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and others.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge", "title": "Vernor Vinge on the Technological Singularity", "publishedDate": "2011-02-07T12:40:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zMIW_O5dIM", "description": "Sign up for a free trial of News Direct's animated news graphics at http://newsdirect.nma.com.tw/Reuters.aspx\n\nScientists are hoping that a substance secreted by hagfish could become the clothing of the future.\nEach hagfish has roughly 100 glands that run along the length of its body that exude a milky, white substance comprised of mucus and thread. The substance is made of very thin, but strong fibers that expand in seawater, but become silky when dried. Each hagfish can produce hundreds of kilometers worth of slime thread. Scientists have been researching the slime and hope to use it to make clothing, such as tights, athletic gear and bullet proof vests. The slime could be a source for a renewable, environmentally-friendly fabric that is a natural alternative to synthetic materials.", "title": "Scientists hope to make clothing out of hagfish slime", "publishedDate": "2013-05-03T10:00:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zMoyRYSlok", "description": "From Faces on Film's third full length album, \"Elite Lines\" out March 25, 2014.\n\nWritten & Produced by Mike Fiore\nMixed & Engineered by Rafi Sofer \n\n---\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/1hb5kK6\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/e1ixqe \nPhysical Album: http://etsy.me/1ix6783\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/FacesOnFilm\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/facesonfilm\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/facesonfilm\nTumblr: http://facesonfilm.tumblr.com \nSoundcloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/faces-on-film", "title": "Faces on Film - Daytime Nowhere (Official Audio)", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T23:43:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zMrmZXzPV4", "description": "When you've spent 10 years locked up and finally manage to escape there is really only one thing on your mind, go on a scoter smashing spree... well that's if you are an Orangutan.

I'm a world record holder, I have multiple 300 games and 800 series and I'm here to talk about both. \n\nCranker style of bowling is a very powerful style. The bowler imparts a lot of revolutions on the ball and a lot of speed, and therefore a lot of hook. When the bowler throws the ball, he will come around the ball with his fingers and that imparts the revolutions on it. He also rotates his positive axis point more so it's facing him, meaning that the revolutions he imparts on the ball are perpendicular to the lane bed and that's what gives the ball its hooking power. \n\nBryan will be demonstrating the Cranker Style. Please not we've marked the axis point on the ball when he releases the ball and how much hook he gets on the ball. The other thing about a cranker bowler is that his timing is a lot later than most other bowlers. He will finish his slide and then come through the ball from behind his back and that's what imparts all the revolutions and power on the ball.", "title": "How to Bowl Cranker Style | Bowling Tips", "publishedDate": "2011-09-19T16:23:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "5zRYjQBscSY", "description": "Dr. Mutwasze is a 6th generation folk healer.

However, IPD caused by nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes has increased, and nonvaccine serotypes are now responsible for the majority of the remaining cases of IPD occurring in children. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration, which, in addition to the 7 serotypes included in the original PCV7, contains the 6 pneumococcal serotypes responsible for 63% of IPD cases now occurring in children younger than 5 years. Because of the expanded coverage provided by PCV13, it will replace PCV7. This statement provides recommendations for (1) the transition from PCV7 to PCV13; (2) the routine use of PCV13 for healthy children and children with an underlying medical condition that increases the risk of IPD; (3) a supplemental dose of PCV13 for (a) healthy children 14 through 59 months of age who have completed the PCV7 series and (b) children 14 through 71 months of age with an underlying medical condition that increases the risk of IPD who have completed the PCV7 series; (4) \"catch-up\" immunization for children behind schedule; and (5) PCV13 for certain children at high risk from 6 through 18 years of age. In addition, recommendations for the use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for children at high risk of IPD are also updated. \n\nLearn more at http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/24/peds.2010-1280.abstract\n\nFor more information on FreeMedicalBilling.Net Medical Billing Software please see http://www.FreeMedicalBilling.Net.

In 1988, Camerica released Freedom Stick, a wireless, consumer IR version of Turbotronic exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Nintendo brought legal action against Camerica because of the products' similarity to the NES Advantage.\n\nCamerica later redesigned Freedom Stick with an unorthodox triangular base intended for both right- and left-handed players, and called the product Supersonic the Joystick. The bottom of the joystick's base is fitted with suction cups to stabilize it on a tabletop.\nFreedom Stick and Supersonic the Joystick were among the first game controllers to communicate via infrared beam.

The sculptor was Johannes Schilling, and the architect was Karl Weisbach. The total cost of the work is estimated at one million gold marks. It was inaugurated on September 28, 1883. The 38 metres (125 ft) tall monument represents the union of all Germans. The central figure is the 10.5 metres (34 ft) tall Germania figure. In the sculptured impression, Germania holds the recovered crown of the emperor in the right hand and in the left the Imperial Sword. The Niederwald is a broad hill on the right bank of the Rhine, between that river and the Wisper, opposite Bingen am Rhein. The hill forms the southwestern apex of the Taunus range. Its summit is clothed with dense forests of oak and beech. Its southern and western sides, which descend sharply to R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein and Assmannshausen on the Rhine, are covered with vineyards, and produce some of the finest wines of the district.

There are even some videos about how to ship books, but I couldn't find a single good one, and so I made this video to help people ship books correctly. I have gotten books shipped to me in plastic bags and boxes. Bags don't work because there is no cushion. Boxes usually don't work because unless there is sufficient padded space around the book, it rattles around and gets damaged. Bflute packaging is the best way to ship a book. You can get Bflute online or locally. When you buy it in bulk, you can wrap a book for about the cost of a padded envelope but for 10x the padding.\n\nYou can save a lot of money when shipping with the USPS! Remember, \"If it fits, it ships!\" Think of how you can creatively jam stuff into those flat rate envelopes so that they will ship safely! Customers always love priority mail shipping and sometimes you can ship stuff out in those envelopes in a way you didn't think you could!

Immediatamente dopo arriva per\u00f2 il terribile colpo: il marito Archie, che lei ama con passione, e che invece la disprezza per la sua timidezza, le confessa di essersi innamorato della propria segretaria, Nancy Neele, e che vuole divorziare da Agatha per sposarla. Le chiede quindi il suo consenso: lei per\u00f2 rifiuta. Quella stessa notte, Agatha fa frettolosamente la valigia ed esce, lasciandosi dietro una lettera per la propria segretaria, Miss Fisher, e una per il marito. Abbandona la macchina non molto lontano da casa, insieme al bagaglio, e prende il treno per Harrogate. La polizia, messa in allarme, comincia a dragare gli stagni delle vicinanze e organizza una colossale battuta di ricerca: nessun risultato, la signora Christie \u00e8 introvabile.

I had moved from my home in Ashtabula, Ohio to New York City early in January 1960 soon after being discharged from a four-year stint in the Air Force. It was at this time I met my lifetime companion, the Cuban born painter Jos\u00e9 Laffitte, and I soon joined a poetry workshop under Arnold Weinstein at the New School for Social Research, where I garnered a second prize Dylan Thomas Award.\n\nBy Columbus Day 1961 we were in San Francisco where I was dying to meet Jack Spicer, and I soon found myself in a workshop with him and Robin Blaser, Stan Persky, and George Stanley on Sunday afternoons at Stan's place in North Beach. The \"worked\" poem. Near the same time I was in a seminar at San Francisco State College under Jack Gilbert. About a year after Spicer's death in 1965, I joined Robert Duncan's workshop at the Society for Individual Rights, while some of these gatherings later took place in Duncan's home, or under his auspices at other locations with special guests. In August of 1969, Paul Mariah, one of the participants in the gatherings, and I started Manroot magazine, funded in large part by grants from the Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines through the National Endowment for the Arts (before it was virtually destroyed by Jessie Helms), and we also held a frequent and critical floating workshop for a few years which Duncan graced occasionally.\n\nIn 1973 Jos\u00e9 and I moved to the Russian River area of Sonoma County, California and became involved in a \"heady\" poetry community with Hunce Voelcker, Andrei Codrescu, Harold Norse, and a host of younger poets.\n\nI continued co-editing Manroot until 1978 when we returned to San Francisco and went back to school, new jobs, and part-time destinations abroad. The 80s were essentially a lost decade, as all community seemed to have dissolved. Love died in 1992.\n\nAround 1994 I met some poets in their 20s whose heroes were the same as those for me when I was in my 20s. What does this mean? Anyway, thanks to them, I have an audience again, and a new kind of long-distance community. Now life is Internet.

Well, this guy here is a king snake. He's docile, he's beautiful, and relatively easy to take care of. King snakes are related to milk snakes, corn snakes, and rat snakes, and the corn snakes have beautiful morphs, beautiful different colors. King snakes have beautiful different colors and they all are relatively docile. They're all in the constrictor family. They are all carnivorous. They all require the basic temperament for handling, as long as you're nice and calm these guys are very, very calm. \n\nSo they do well with the beginner. Their terrarium and their setup is very easy. Normally, probably an easy way of figuring out, \"Okay, I've got a snake, what is the space that I need?\" Well, if you take the length of your snake in feet, the length of the terrarium and the width of the terrarium should be a little bit longer than the length of the snake, and there's your minimal. So there's a good way of figuring out exactly how much we need, okay?\n\nNow when you get the terrarium the first thing that you need to plan on for all of this class, your corn snakes, the rat snakes, the king snakes, the milk snakes is we need to set up a temperature gradient. It's very, very important. All snakes are ectotherms. They're cold-blooded, so they need their environment to help them heat up. So we want to set up an area on one side of the terrarium that is high 80's, maybe low 90's for these guys, but high 80's does well. And then at the other side of the terrarium, a cooler area that is high 70's, low 80's. \n\nNow the way you can do that is they make heating tape that you can put underneath your terrarium and it keeps a basic temperature, and you can use different lighting or heat sources on one side. It is very, very important that when you set up the terrarium for taking care of these guys that you have thermometers in there and remember your snake is living down at the bottom. So the thermometer needs to be down here where the snake is not up at the top of your terrarium, because the temperature gradient isn't up here. They're not up there. So you get your thermometer and you put it down here where the heating area is and down on the other side so you can tell  this side is high 80's. This side is high 70's, low 80's. \n\nAnd then they're very easy to feed, they readily take mice. When they're younger you'll do pinkies, and when they're older you use larger mice, and the way to figure that out is, remember that you always check the widest area of the snake's body. The bait should never be wider than that. These guys are friendly, docile. Their area is very easy to develop. Now they can get larger. This guy here may get up to five to seven feet. And all of that class will live anywhere from 10 to 25 years. Most of the time it's in the teens to low 20's, so be ready to enjoy these guys for a long time when you start with them.", "title": "Best Pet Snake for Beginners | Pet Snakes", "publishedDate": "2013-05-30T00:20:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "60Q-SqVPAws", "description": "Don't worry, online bingo fans, it's nearly the end of half term -- next week you won't have the kids under your feet.\n\nTo distract you from them a bit, why not play a bit of Posh Bingo?

Se canta con la misma melod\u00eda que el himno nacional del Reino Unido, Dios salve a la Reina. Las letras fueron escritas en 1850 por Jakob Josef Jauch. Hasta 1963, el primer verso y t\u00edtulo era \"Oben am deutschen Rhein\" (\"Sobre lo alto del Rin alem\u00e1n\"). La supresi\u00f3n de la menci\u00f3n alemana en el himno tras 1963 atestigua el amplio sentir de ambivalencia cultural hacia expresiones relacionadas con el nacionalismo alem\u00e1n despu\u00e9s del periodo nazi en Alemania y Austria.\n\n\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9ENGLISH\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cf\nOben am jungen Rhein (Up above the young Rhine), sung to the same tune as God Save the Queen, has been the national anthem of Liechtenstein since 1963, when the lyrics were altered (the first line had been Oben am deutschen Rhein).\nThe original lyrics had been written in 1850 by Swiss pastor Jakob Josef Jauch (1802--1859), in a time when the Principality of Liechtenstein, which is considered the last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, was a member of the German Confederation. About a decade earlier, French claims to the left bank of the Rhine (Rhine Crisis of 1840) had triggered a series of German Rhine songs of which Die Wacht am Rhein is the most famous.\nJauch's lyrics were adopted in 1920 as national anthem. In 1963, the anthem was shortened, and references to German and Germany were removed: am deutschen Rhein (on the German Rhine) became am jungen Rhein (on the young Rhine), and im deutschen Vaterland (in the German fatherland) became das teure Vaterland (the precious fatherland). The second original stanza, containing Auf Deutschlands Wacht (on guard for Germany) was, like the third and fourth, discontinued altogether.\n\n\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9DEUTSCH\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cf\nOben am jungen Rhein ist die Nationalhymne Liechtensteins seit 1963, als das schon seit Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts als Hymne dienende Lied Oben am deutschen Rhein durch Ersetzen von auf Deutsch bzw. Deutschland verweisende Textstellen ge\u00e4ndert wurde.\nDer Originaltext wurde in den 1850er Jahren von Jakob Josef Jauch (1802--1859) geschrieben. Als Melodie wird die der Nationalhymne des Vereinigten K\u00f6nigreiches (God Save the Queen) verwendet. Die erste nachweisbare Auff\u00fchrung vor gro\u00dfem Publikum erfolgte bei der Er\u00f6ffnung der Landesausstellung 1895 in Vaduz, und damals scheint die Hymne schon recht bekannt gewesen zu sein. Versuche, aus dem Text den Begriff \u00abdeutsch\u00bb zu streichen, gab es seit 1918. Sie stie\u00dfen zun\u00e4chst noch auf Widerst\u00e4nde und bis in die 1940er Jahre waren die reformierte und die Originalversion umstritten. Trotz erneuter Anl\u00e4ufe gleich nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg wurden erst 1963 auch offiziell die Bez\u00fcge auf Deutschland entfernt: aus \u00abam deutschen Rhein\u00bb wurde \u00abam jungen Rhein\u00bb, und \u00abim deutschen Vaterland\u00bb wurde zu \u00abdas teure Vaterland\u00bb.

He covers the basic methods to adjust as well as checking the functionality of the slack adjuster.  For more information on service or repairs please contact one of our locations or visit our website www.badger-utility.com\n\nHi, I am Aaron with Badger Utility, and I am going to show you how to adjust automatic slack adjusters and check their functionality.  Having properly adjusted automatic slack adjusters not only maintains even brake wear, but also maintains the proper stopping distance.\n\nThis is an automatic slack adjuster.  It maintains proper brake adjustment on the wheel end.  What we will do to adjust this is put our wrench on here and turn it clockwise until the brake tightens up.  Then we will back it off one half turn, and your brakes should be set in the proper adjustment.\n\nNow let's make sure the brake adjuster is working properly.  What we will do is back it off further than one half turn.  This brake adjuster is already backed off one half of a turn.  Then we will take a wrench and put it on the adjust nut and apply the brakes.\nRelease, Apply, Release, Apply, Release, Apply, Release.\nAs you can see the wrench is turning.  That means the brake is trying to adjust itself back up under application.\n\nAdjusting an automatic slack adjuster is fairly simple. Making sure that all four wheel ends are adjusted properly will keep your trailer stopping as it should.", "title": "How to Adjust an Automatic Slack Adjuster", "publishedDate": "2014-04-04T22:15:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "60ZsOP3F3mM", "description": "We tried to be like Indy...

This thickening may limit the use of one or more fingers or may eventually cause the fingers to be pulled in toward the palm.  It's a hereditary condition and the cause is not known, however it may be associated with smoking, vascular disease, epilepsy and diabetes. It is more common in men over the age of 50. The disease appears later in women.\nThe first sign is usually a small lump or nodule in the palm, occurring many times in the crease of the hand that is closest to the base of the ring and little fingers. Further indication is when the palm cannot be placed flat on a flat surface such as a table. As the disease progresses, the involved finger is drawn toward the palm.\nTreatment is most effective when sought at the nodule (small lump) stage. Collagenase injections are available as a non-surgical option. Surgery will only temporarily restore use to the fingers. With time the condition will return. You doctor will discuss with you your individual case and whether surgery is a viable option for you. Hand therapy may be recommended with or without surgery.\n\nFor media inquiries with any of the hand center's experts, call Debra Schindler, Director of Media & Public Relations, MedStar Health, Baltimore:  410-554-2496.

The purine nucleotide cycle involves conversion of aspartate to fumarate (a key TCA cycle intermediate.)\n\nDuring exercise, muscles utilize this cycle to upregulate TCA intermediates.  AMP deaminase is key in generating IMP (via a deamination reaction), and IMP is then necessary to accept carbons and nitrogens from aspartate to form adenylosuccinate.  Subsequent release of fumarate from adenylosuccinate restores AMP for subsequent rounds of metabolism, but also expands the pool of available fumarate/TCA intermediates for muscle energy!\n--------------------\nINTRODUCTION: Text explanation as follows by C. Leggett\n[Adenosine and guanine] are purine bases, whereas [cytosine, uracil, and thymine] are pyrimidine bases.  Although these molecules are often thought of as building blocks for DNA synthesis, their physiologic actions are diverse.\n--------------------\nDETAILED OVERVIEW:\n(1) AMP deaminase is animated here\n(2) It deaminates AMP (via hydrolysis)--generating IMP\u2014releasing an NH4+ in the process.\n(3) Subsequently, aspartate is consumed, and the aspartate nitrogen is added to the C-6 carbonyl group of IMP, generating  adenylosuccinate (a bulkier molecule, now containing 4 new carbons and a nitrogen atom derived from the aspartate pool).  This addition is regulated by the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase (which has GTP binding domains--permitting GTP-powered addition of aspartic acid to IMP.   \n(5) Adenylosuccinase then mediates release of the 4-carbon fumarate, while the nitrogen derived from aspartate is retained at C-6 (i.e. fumarate release leaves an amine group at C-6, hence AMP is regenerated.)\n(6) Fumarate released from adenolysuccinate (via adenylosuccinase) not only regenerates AMP, but fumarate is utilized to generate cellular energy (ATP) via the citric acid cycle/TCA cycle in the mitochondria.\n--------------------\nKEY POINTS:\nAspartate (aspartic acid) and IMP must be available for the ATP generation.  \n1. If AMP deaminase is deficient, there will be no IMP formation, hence no C-6 carbonyl group will be available for aspartate addition\u2014interrupting the necessary funneling of aspartate into the cycle.   (No AMP deaminase? \uf0e0 NO IMP \uf0e0 No Aspartate addition \uf0e0 no fumarate\uf0e0 no ATP\uf0e0 muscle cramping.)\n2. If for some reason there is a lack of aspartate (a non-essential amino acid that can be produced in the body or obtained dietarily), there will be rate-limitation of Adenylosuccinate generation (i.e. N6-(1,2-Dicarboxyethyl)AMP).  Less Adenylosuccinate means less N6-(1,2-Dicarboxyethyl  available for release as fumarate to feed mitochondrial ATP production.\n--------------------\nCOMMON POINTS OF CONFUSION:\nFor clarification, AMP metabolism (discussed in this video) should not be confused with adenosine metabolism (which is metabolized by adenosine deaminase or ADA). \n\n(A) Adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMP deaminase) IS the enzyme explained in this video.\n- AMP is a nucleotide which has a =  1.phosphate group, 2. sugar ribose, 3. adenine base, and AMP deaminase is the first enzyme in the pathway\n\n(B) Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is NOT discussed.  Adenosine is a nucleoSIDE, which only contains a 1. Sugar ribose 2. Adenine base.  Its metabolism is regulated by ADA  (Adenosine deaminase), an enzyme defect that is associated with an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that accounts for 15% cases of SCID (a type of immunodeficiency).", "title": "AMP Deaminase and the Purine Nucleotide Cycle in HD (AMP Deaminase Deficiency Symptoms).mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-01-02T18:16:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "60dX17rE_uU", "description": "Israel has demolished the home of a Palestinian who drove his van into a tram stop in Jerusalem, killing two people.  \n\nThe Government says it's a necessary deterrent and more demolitions will follow.

Fluid flow in this ciliated structure is responsible for the induction of unilateral left-sided Nodal activity in the lateral plate mesoderm, which in turn regulates organ laterality. Bmp signalling activity has been implied in repressing Nodal expression on the right side, however its mechanism of action has been controversial. In a forward genetic screen for mutations that affect LR patterning, we identified the zebrafish linkspoot (lin) mutant, characterized by cardiac laterality and mild dorsoventral patterning defects. Mapping of the lin mutation revealed an inactivating missense mutation in the Bmp receptor 1aa (bmpr1aa) gene. Embryos with a mutation in lin/bmpr1aa and a novel mutation in its paralogue, bmpr1ab, displayed a variety of dorsoventral and LR patterning defects with increasing severity corresponding with a decrease in bmpr1a dosage. In Bmpr1a-deficient embryos we observed bilateral expression of the Nodal-related gene, spaw, coupled with reduced expression of the Nodal-antagonist lefty1 in the midline. Using genetic models to induce or repress Bmp activity in combination with Nodal inhibition or activation, we found that Bmp and Nodal regulate lefty1 expression in the midline independently of each other. Furthermore, we observed that the regulation of lefty1 by Bmp signalling is required for its observed downregulation of Nodal activity in the LPM providing a novel explanation for this phenomenon. From these results we propose a two-step model in which Bmp regulates LR patterning. Prior to the onset of nodal flow and Nodal activation, Bmp is required to induce lefty1 expression in the midline. When nodal flow has been established and Nodal activity is apparent, both Nodal and Bmp independently are required for lefty1 expression to assure unilateral Nodal activation and correct LR patterning.\n\nAuthor Summary \nAlthough vertebrates are bilaterally symmetric when observed from the outside, inside the body cavity the organs are positioned asymmetrically with respect to the left and right sides. Cases where all the organs are mirror imaged, known as situs inversus, are not associated with any medical defects. Severe medical problems occur however in infants with a partial organ reversal (situs ambigious or heterotaxia), which arises during embryonic development. Left-right asymmetry in the embryo is established by unilateral expression of Nodal, a member of the Tgf-\u00df superfamily of secreted growth factors, a role that has been conserved from human to snails. By performing a genetic screen in zebrafish for laterality mutants, we have identified the linkspoot mutant, which displayed partial defects in asymmetric left-right positioning of the internal organs. The gene disrupted in the linkspoot mutant encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp), another member of the Tgf-\u00df superfamily of secreted growth factors. Further analysis of Bmp over-expression or knock-down models demonstrate that Bmp signalling is required for unilateral Nodal expression, through the initiation and maintenance of an embryonic midline barrier. Our results demonstrate a novel and important mechanism by which left-right asymmetry in the vertebrate embryo is established and regulated.\n\nSupplemental methods.\n- Video S1: High speed image of cilia rotation in the KV of a wild type embryo at 8 somites.

In both of these years, bleaching was recorded on 50-60 per cent of reefs.\n\nMore recently in the summer of 2006, reefs in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef were affected by bleaching.

Gordon, the first director of the Lib. of Congress' Archive of American Folk Culture, began his career studying sailor songs in Frisco and Oakland, early 1920s. Perhaps because he was an American, unlike most of the other folklorists who had taken an interest in sailors' chanties in the early 20th century, Gordon sought to emphasize the relationship between chanties and Af-American worksongs. \n\nA few years after his chanty-collecting work in Frisco Bay, he shifted to coastal Georgia, where he collected local African-American songs. They included the boat-rowing songs, once common on Southern plantations, that he believed to be the most \"ancient\" of Af-American songs. My own historical research supports his suspicions. In any case, Gordon was the earliest of the folklorists to take these songs seriously. \n\nIn 1927, Gordon wrote a series of articles for the New York Times on \"Folk Songs of America,\" among which he included pieces on deepwater chanties + the Black songs from Georgia (the above illustration is from one of these).  \n\nGordon collected 2 renditions of \"Julie\" from West Coast sailors. They are not commercially available, but rather kept at the Lib. of Congress. One of these was the initial inspiration for what might be called \"the Revival form\" of \"London Julie.\" Seems that British folk singer Roy Harris was the one to first develop a rendition (late 70s/early 80s) from the archive fragment. I've heard neither the Gordon Collection recording nor Harris' original rendition. But that rendition, with verses added by Harris (and who knows what else?) spread as the version now pop. with singers like Peter Souza, here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMSeWvxsFRY\n\nWhen Barry Finn learned the Harris version, he adapted the verses to suit his own taste, and that branched off into this version sung by the likes of the Johnson Girls:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m1ZV45_wv8\n\nSo though this chanty was not widely documented in history, it has become quite popular in the Revival. \n\nThis is all by way of background to the present rendition of mine, which is based neither in Gordon nor the Revival, but in the collection of JM Carpenter. Carpenter collected three (?) renditions of a \"London Julie\" chantey, from seamen in Britain in the late 1920s. These appear to be from Edward Robinson, John McPherson, and Alexander Blue. Blue's is the most substantial. My rendition is based mainly on his recording.\n\nThe singing of Blue is hardly as curvy melodically as the modern Revival version, however, I see the potentially in that as a chanted line that the singer could (and would) vary, instead of an engraved tune. And the rhythm is less syncopated but, then again, so were most chanties\u2014not very syncopated, that is. They were for coordinating work, not dancing! What I have attempted to do sounds, to me, more like a halyard or even a rowing song.\n\nThe lyrics are basically those of Blue, noted by Carpenter or heard on (deciphered from) recording. The lyrics about the \"n---er\" not only betray a probable Af-American origin for the song but also connect it to other songs like the plantation \"corn songs\" that used \"Never seen the like since I been born\" in couplets. This was typically rhymed with \"corn\". A line similar to the 2nd and 3rd verse here occurred in chantyman Bullen's collection (1914) in the context of the song \"Ten Stone\":\n\n     I nebber seen de like sence I ben bawn!...\n     Nigger on de ice an a hoe-in up corn...\n     Ten stone! Ten stone, ten stone de win' am ober!\n     Jenny git along Jenny blow de horn,\n     As we go marchin' ober!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpH7ry18QJQ\nFunny thing, Blue also sang \"Ten Stone\" for Carpenter\u2014the only other chantyman besides Bullen to mention it. Blue's rendition of \"Ten Stone\" has \"crack corn,\" like the odd phrase in his \"Julie\" (verse 2).\n\nCompare the shape of \"London Julie\" to the work-song \"Sheep Shell Corn\":\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=sKlOYEg_5c8C&pg=PA135&dq=sheep+shell+corn&hl=en&sa=X&ei=weXzUMf_EsS4igLv3oHIBA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sheep%20shell%20corn&f=false\n\nThe relatively flat (around the tonic) melody line of the solo parts correspond to Blue's \"Julie.\" And the shape of the choral refrains (ending first on the third, then on the tonic) match the \"a-ha London Julie.\" The phrase \"O! blow your horn, blow horn blow!\" would seem to map on London Julie's \"O row, o row, we're bound to go!\" Moreover, \"blow the horn\" was in Bullen's \"Ten Stone.\" Indeed, the tropes of \"blow the/your/my horn\" and \"X the corn\" appear in many 19th c African-American songs.\n\nThere is of course the minstrel song intersection with it all. Take this excerpt from a minstrel style piece, \"The Raccoon Hunt\" [ca1830] in an 1847 publication:\n\nSitting on a rail (repeat) \nWid his bottle in his hand. \nJo shell de corn, Sam blow de horn, \nNeber seed the like since I was born; \n'Twas sent to de mill by tick-lip Bill, \nOh, do, Johnny Boker, do...", "title": "London Julie (chantey)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-15T08:43:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "60tzplH6Hm8", "description": "Intrigante caso de desaparecimento de aeronave e seu piloto vinculado ao avistamento de um OVNI.\n\nN\u00e3o esque\u00e7a de se inscrever no canal;\nSe gostou, clique em \"gostei\";\nCompartilhe o video nas redes sociais;\nDeixe seu coment\u00e1rio;\n\nCurta nossa comunidade no Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Area51Canal\n\nSe preferir, mande um e-mail: canalarea51@live.com\n\nAjude o canal a crescer.", "title": "O caso Frederick Valentich", "publishedDate": "2014-03-27T01:12:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "60uEufEH2wE", "description": "My Instructor Frank Melvin and myself on a dive in Loch Fyne coming across a rare sighting of a Cornish Lumpsucker.", "title": "Cornish Lumpsucker - Lephinmore - 24-01-10.avi", "publishedDate": "2010-01-24T15:22:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "60uZ7xEzdCA", "description": "Ch\u00fac m\u1ecdi ng\u01b0\u1eddi m\u1ed9t m\u00f9a gi\u00e1ng sinh an l\u00e0nh.\nMerry Christmas - Gi\u00e1ng Sinh Ng\u1ecdt Ng\u00e0o \n\n\nB\u00e0i h\u00e1t :Gi\u00e1ng sinh ng\u1ecdt ng\u00e0o -  Kh\u1ed5ng T\u1eed Qu\u1ef3nh ft Miu L\u00ea [kara]", "title": "Merry Christmas - Ch\u00fac m\u1eebng gi\u00e1ng sinh", "publishedDate": "2012-12-11T16:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "60v3_3x4BYk", "description": "ARC PLS T", "title": "ARCSIN CUTTING SYSTEMS", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T13:30:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "60vIr79QbGs", "description": "Using video footage with both short and longer staff slings, as well as a hand sling, to self-review technique.

A lot of people never tried a forearm stand, even though they perform regular handstand with ease, but this move has been used by old-time hand balancers and it's popular in yoga as well. \n\nWhat's interesting about this move is the fact that it's easier to perform than a regular handstand, with just a bit of practice. Moreover, the forearm stand is quite useful as a lead-up stunt to the handstand. Before you start practicing, be advised that you actually need more flexibility to perform the forearm stand than you need for a regular handstand. Many people start their handstand training with arched back, but in a forearm stand it's nearly impossible to have a straight back. In fact you're back will have even bigger arch than in a handstand. For this reason, you'll need a pretty flexible back and if you don't have one, you'll need to do bridging and similar exercises to build it up. \n\nI recommend you do this exercise against a wall when you first start with it, as it can feel a bit strange otherwise. Once you get comfortable with it, you may start kicking out in the open. Start with kneeling on the ground against the wall with parallel forearms, laid flat accross the ground. After that you'll want to get in a sprinter type of stance with forearms on the ground, kick one leg than the other leg is gonna follow. You'll want to be a fairly close to the wall, but not very close either. Once you get in that position, try to push back with your chest so you're not collapsing forward. The common mistake with forearm stand is explained in the video, along with additional tips to perform a forearm stand.", "title": "How to do a Forearm Stand", "publishedDate": "2014-01-23T18:06:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "61Ft0t36_tA", "description": "Acoustic", "title": "Ringside - Struggle", "publishedDate": "2007-04-10T03:47:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "61FtkfQOVJw", "description": "Come viene realizzato l'intaglio del pannello centrale della madia sarda.

The man is then seen kicking at least one Secret Service dog that was released on him before he is surrounded by agents.\n\nThe incident is believed to have been occurred around 7.15pm.\n\nIt comes less than five weeks after another man, Omar Gonzalez, 42, scaled the perimeter fence carrying a knife, crossed the lawn and broke into the White House East Room.\n\nThat incident \u2013 on 19 September \u2013 sparked an intense debate over the Security Service\u2019s ability to protect the US president and culminated in the resignation of its director, Julia Pierson.\n\nPhilipos Meluku-Bello, a 52-year-old peace activist who witnessed Gonzalez jump over the fence and evade agents last month, and also saw the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s incident, said agents were much quicker on the scene this time.\n\n\u201cThe response was immediate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like the dropping of the ball four weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\nHe added: \u201cHe [the intruder] was being wise, staying stiff. I don\u2019t think these guys [the agents] were going to be embarrassed a second time.\u201d\n\nMeluku-Bello said he first first looked towards the White House grounds when he heard a man yell and the sound of a whistle. Seconds later, he said, \u201cfive, maybe six secret agents swarmed on him \u2026 they had batons and flashlights out\u201d.\n\nSeveral witnesses said the crowd outside the White House were moved into the park and, shortly afterwards, shepherded eastwards toward H Street.\n\nIt is the seventh time someone has scaled the White House fence this year.", "title": "WATCH: Man Jumps White House Fence causing Lockdown Amid US On Alert After Canada Attack", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23T01:33:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "61JwgU8XYmo", "description": "Armed Forces of the Philippines decided to punish Marc Sueselbeck, the German fiance of the murder transgender, Jennifer Laude.\n\nSubscribe to the ABS-CBN News channel! - http://bit.ly/TheABSCBNNews\n\nWatch the full episodes of Bandila on TFC.TV  \nhttp://bit.ly/BANDILA-TFCTV\nand on IWANT.TV for Philippine viewers, click:\nhttp://bit.ly/BANDILA-IWANTV\n\nVisit our website at http://www.abs-cbnnews.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abscbnNEWS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abscbnnews", "title": "Jennifer's fiance faces deportation, ban", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T19:05:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "61JwtfsNAeM", "description": "THE BEAST HAS 7 HEADS AND 10 HORNS: Switzerland has 7 heads of state who behave as kings do, and they divide 10 ministries among themselves.", "title": "Templar`s Cross, Black Pope, Jesuits, Swiss Financing, Vatican Guard & Anti Christ (ante christi)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-29T16:08:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "61KE5mg5trg", "description": "this is like my childhood :)", "title": "Nightcore~ Poor unfortunate souls", "publishedDate": "2014-04-12T13:46:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "61KFV2Cqk44", "description": "Hab mir f\u00fcrn Zwanni einen Haufen gebrauchte DVDs gekauft und auf einer war ein merkw\u00fcrdiger Sticker, der mich zum Nachdenken gebracht hat.", "title": "\"Ein Stern in dieser DVD\"", "publishedDate": "2014-11-13T13:59:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "61KQq6gpnuw", "description": "100% Baiano!\n\nQuer nos ajudar?

Over 15 tons of shaved ice was blown into the pandas exhibit as part of an enrichment surprise for the pandas.\n\nWhile the other giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo have experienced snow in their exhibits before, it was all about new experiences as the youngest member of the panda family, Xiao Liwu, got to play in the snow for the first time.\n\nThe seven-month-old cub walked from his bedroom out onto the snow and was soon playing with Mom in his snowy exhibit. Xiao Liwu, or \"Mr. Wu,\" as keepers call him, climbed all over his mother and playfully wrestled with her, relishing his first snow day.\n\n\"Xiao Liwu definitely had fun playing in the snow and mom enjoyed it as well as she was laying on her back when she was making snow pandas,\" said Jennifer Becerra, San Diego Zoo senior keeper.\n\n\"Xiao Liwu was jumping on her and wrestling with her and getting used to being thrown in the snow by momma bear. It was definitely fun to watch, he was climbing in the trees, around the exhibit and exploring it all.\"\n\nThe San Diego Zoo's giant pandas are on a research loan from the People's Republic of China. As part of this long-term program, the Zoo is also collaborating with the Chinese Academy of Science in studies of behavior, ecology, genetics and conservation of wild pandas living in the Foping Nature Reserve.\n\nOnly 1,600 giant pandas are believed to exist in the wild, and the species is primarily threatened by habitat loss. San Diego Zoo Global, in conjunction with Chinese panda experts, continues to work on science-based panda conservation programs.\n\nFor more news and videos visit \u261b http://ntd.tv \nFollow us on Twitter \u261b http://twitter.com/NTDTelevision  \nAdd us on Facebook \u261b http://on.fb.me/s5KV2C", "title": "Cute Panda Cubs Playing in the Snow", "publishedDate": "2013-03-21T07:05:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "61MHONRkIgc", "description": "Campaigning firefighters serenade Dame Judi Dench at Philomena premiere - BFI London Film Festival\n\nSubscribe to the Press Association: http://bit.ly/RvMVLq\n\nDame Judi Dench was serenaded by protesting firemen at the premiere of her new film Philomena .\n\nMembers of the Fire Brigades Union were campaigning against pension cuts, waving banners and placards as they drank outside a pub in London's Leicester Square while Dame Judi walked the red carpet with co-star Steve Coogan and director Stephen Frears.\n\nThe 78-year-old actress got the giggles trying to give an interview as the rowdy firefighters sang The Beatles' Hey Jude and chanted, \"We love you Judi.\"\n\nThey also shouted \"Aha!\" at Steve, the catchphrase of his hit comedy character Alan Partridge.\n\nThe film, co-written and produced by Steve, tells the true story of Philomena Lee's search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s by the nuns who ran an Irish convent where she gave birth.\n\n\nDame Judi said at the gala screening for the BFI London Film Festival: \"Philomena is an exceptional woman and this story is about her fortitude, and her strength and her faith.\n\n\"If we were all as strong in our convictions as Philomena then we wouldn't have much to worry about.\"\n\nSteve plays journalist Martin Sixsmith, who helped Lee in her attempt to track down her son and wrote a book about her story.\n\nThe actor, who has campaigned for press regulation, insisted he did not set out to portray journalists as the villains of the piece.\n\nSteve said: \"I only have strong views about bad press, I like good press. I like good journalists.\n\n\"So it's not that I thought 'I'm playing a journalist, what an awful thing to do.' That's a really simplistic, reductive thing that certain sections of the press do.\n\n\"The story happened to involve a journalist, so I just played a journalist as a human being. My involvement in Hacked Off and Leveson and trying to improve press standards and make the press accountable, which is something I'm very proud of, doesn't have anything to do with this.\n\n\"There's no real judgment on Martin as a journalist.

I used the same old camcorder in my earlier vids here, and downconverted the huge high quality m2t files to Youtube preferred mp4s - these may look rough due to fast conversion without editing.  Now you can get a complete Alpha Shorthand demo of each shorthand form and the long exercises.  The exercises troubled some shorthanders who prefer to see a demo of each one - I answered that request on my website where you freely download a pdf of ebook.  edu2002.net/alpha1.html.  Then I spent a week taping all 17 lessons, using the same camera in my other vids here.  Now, the video on this page - Alpha Shorthand Letters and Accents - different animal. I prepared this video with a different method involving use of Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Paint Shop Pro, Pinnacle Studio - and a Graphics Pen Tablet.  May not use this inefficient technique again for lessons because so time intensive, taking five hours to produce this one show.  Goal of this video: to make a handwriting exercise to help a shorthand writer make sure strokes and avoid confusion from sloppy handwriting.  I hope you find this video fast enough, clear, that it shows well on your screen, not blurry.  I try to reduce talking thru the vid for more visual focus.  BTW, the symbols and accents part of this vid form part of my advanced Alpha Shorthand built off basic Alpha Shorthand.  Advanced notetaking goes to warp speeds 2x, 3x, 5x etc.  Something to look forward to.\n\nI put a free ebook download at the link that shows how to write these and the other most frequent words, as well as most common word parts, meaning ending (suffix), beginning (prefix), and root for many words. If you do a web search for \"most frequent words\" in the English language, you will see that Alpha Shorthand handles almost all of them.  Educational Goal here: to help you write faster and more efficiently all your notes, classwork, research, messages, job writing, creative writing, etc.  Look on my Youtube Channel for demos.  I use Alpha Shorthand when I do messages, notes, dictation, research, manuscripts, and so on.  The videos here show samples of how to do this.  You can easilly make short forms for vocabularies for all kinds of documents in business, medical, law work, research, school work, etc.  \n\nBTW, for those who asked, I often turn off rating and comments (except w approval) on most videos I create for education and not for popularity.\n\nEbook at Amazon's Kindle store.\nVideos on YOUTUBE\nFree ebook : http://edu2002.net/alpha1.html", "title": "Alpha Shorthand - how to write Letters and Accents.mp4", "publishedDate": "2011-03-26T22:45:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "61cKYvrHLBs", "description": "2nd mini Album\u300cPLY\u300dAmazon\u306b\u3066\u767a\u58f2\u4e2d\uff01\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00MWGTSBM\n\u53ce\u9332\u66f2\u21d2http://youtu.be/gmOVVREyvug\n\n1st mini Album\u300cRe:\u300dTHX\uff01SOLD OUT\uff01\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00IOF1FGG\n\u53ce\u9332\u66f2\u21d2http://youtu.be/cYsRVHgkYZ8\n\u203b\u6b8b\u308a\u308f\u305a\u304b\u3067\u3059\u304c\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u4f1a\u5834\u3067\u306e\u307f\u8ca9\u58f2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\nRe:ply Official Website\nhttp://reply.main.jp\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Reply/343604459047424\n\nVo \u3053\u3088\u307f\u3093\uff0f\u30e8\u30b7\u30bf\u30ab\u3001https://twitter.com/koyomin_\nGt/mix \u306b\u3083\u3093\u307a\uff0fshota https://twitter.com/shota0902o\nBa kyoya https://twitter.com/kyoya_bass\nDr mika https://twitter.com/mika_t_dr\n\nLIVE \n2014.10.30 TSUTAYA O-CREST\u300cNew WORLD vol.6\u300d\n2014.11.2  TSUTAYA O-CREST\u300c\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u300d", "title": "Re:ply\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8", "publishedDate": "2014-10-24T09:00:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "61cT4IeP4yI", "description": "Aaron Lewis Screws up National Anthem at 2014 World Series\nAaron Lewis sings the national anthem before Game 5 of the World Series.\nAaron Lewis National Anthem\nhttp://youtu.be/61cT4IeP4yI", "title": "Aaron Lewis Sits on the throne...Sang the national anthem", "publishedDate": "2014-10-27T10:40:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "61cTNOl9Oxg", "description": "Welcome to Viona Corset online store for quality authentic steel boned Corset by Easto Garments.\nEasto Garments  itself defines the quality and reliability of corset manufacturing and exporting.

This was crucial given the speedy descent ahead and many were red lining before they even got into the technical trails.\n\nCheck here to read our full report: http://bit.ly/2013RedBullFoxHunt", "title": "Vitus rider Colin Ross wins Red Bull Foxhunt 2013", "publishedDate": "2013-10-09T10:59:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "61quazc-cMk", "description": "Yurtd\u0131\u015f\u0131nda 23 Nisan Ulusal Egemenlik ve \u00c7ocuk Bayram\u0131 Co\u015fkusu\n\nwww.boynuyogunluyuz.com", "title": "Bi\u015fkek T\u00fcrk \u0130lk ve Orta Okulu (23 Nisan 2013)", "publishedDate": "2013-04-26T09:08:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "61rOf44u6fo", "description": "Laying a path is easy with Lafarge Tarmac ready-to-use Multi-Purpose Concrete.", "title": "Laying A Path", "publishedDate": "2012-03-14T16:45:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "61sKl7qklMg", "description": "Tipeee: https://www.tipeee.com/groberttv\nBoutique: http://groberttv.spreadshirt.fr/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GrobertTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GrobertTV\nAsk: http://ask.fm/GrobertTV", "title": "Robert r\u00e9pond !", "publishedDate": "2014-08-23T13:44:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "61sUZnzRwIk", "description": "The Mood of a Worm\n3D movie created from confocal Z-stack projections of a transgenic L1 hermaphrodite worm (wild type background) expressing the ntc-1::gfp transgene.   \nMovie S1 of Vasopressin/Oxytocin-Related Signaling Regulates Gustatory Associative Learning in C. elegans - Science 26 October 2012: Vol. 338 no. 6106 pp. 543-545 DOI: 10.1126/science.1226860\n\nReferences\n- The Mood of a Worm\nScience 26 October 2012: Vol. 338 no. 6106 pp. 475-476 DOI: 10.1126/science.1230251 \nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/475.summary \n\n- Oxytocin/Vasopressin-Related Peptides Have an Ancient Role in Reproductive Behavior\nScience 26 October 2012: Vol. 338 no. 6106 pp. 540-543 DOI: 10.1126/science.1226201 \nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/540.abstract \n\n- Vasopressin/Oxytocin-Related Signaling Regulates Gustatory Associative Learning in C. elegans\nScience 26 October 2012: Vol. 338 no. 6106 pp. 543-545 DOI: 10.1126/science.1226860\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/543.abstract \n\n- Supplementary Materials Video\nMovie S1\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2012/10/24/338.6106.543.DC1/1226860s1.mpg\n3D movie created from confocal Z-stack projections of a transgenic L1 hermaphrodite worm (wild type background) expressing the ntc-1::gfp transgene. \n\nMovie S2\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2012/10/24/338.6106.543.DC1/1226860s2.mpg\n3D movie created from confocal Z-stack projections of a transgenic L1 hermaphrodite worm (wild type background) expressing the ntr-1::gfp transgene. \n\nMovie S3\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2012/10/24/338.6106.543.DC1/1226860s3.mpg\n3D movie created from confocal Z-stack projections of a transgenic L1 hermaphrodite worm (wild type background) expressing the ntr-2::gfp transgene.", "title": "The Mood of a Worm", "publishedDate": "2012-10-28T17:10:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "61sZqSTM4GU", "description": "JFC in conjunction with dairy experts have identified the conditions that contribute to maximum performance and designed the JFC Deluxe Cow Cubicle.

Never let your friends tie you to the tracks... but let them make a sequel to Trainspotting! (Filmed during our interview with the Once Upon A Time cast at San Diego Comic-Con: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GU7-3qBE6dU)\n\nArticle: http://www.craveonline.com/?p=541131\n\nFor years we've been hoping for a Trainspotting 2. It may seem odd that an independent British film about heroin addicts in Scotland is one of the most talked about potential sequels out there, but Danny Boyle's film -- which helped intro audiences around the world to actors Ewan McGregor, Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle -- was a dynamo upon its original release, announced the future Oscar-winning director as one of the great talents of his generation and adorning colleges across America with poster that insisted we all \"Choose life.\"\n\nThe original novelist, Irvine Welsh, wrote a 2002 follow-up to Trainspotting called Porno in which Rent Boy, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie find themselves in the world of pornography instead of hard drugs, leading us all to wonder when Boyle would schedule a sequel. It's been on-and-off Boyle's radar ever since, but according to Robert Carlyle -- doing the press line for \"Once Upon a Time\" at Comic-Con 2013 -- it's finally going to happen.\n\n\"I think for the for the first time I can actually say yes, it's going to happen,\" Robert Carlyle told Athena Stamos of CraveOnline. \"[Danny Boyle] is ready to do it now. He feels that the cast, himself and the rest of the lads are at the right age to do that now. Because he always had the idea to do it, but he wanted it to be as it was in the follow-up book. They're fifteen years older. And I certainly look fifteen years older now so it's time to do it.\"\n\nIt certainly does seem to be the perfect time to for Danny Boyle to make Trainspotting 2, whether or not he calls it Porno. Ewan McGregor recently said he was ready to return to his starmaking role a Rent Boy, despite publicly stating that he didn't think Welsh's follow-up novel was particularly good, and after well-publicized falling out with Danny Boyle after the director gave the starring role in 2000's The Beach to Leonardo DiCaprio instead of his longtime thespian collaborator.", "title": "Robert Carlyle on TRAINSPOTTING 2 (Comic-Con 2013)", "publishedDate": "2013-07-24T18:52:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "62-IezzjAJg", "description": "FLASH..

It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating and drinking during daylight hours and is intended to teach Muslims about patience, spirituality, humility and submissiveness to God. Muslims fast for the sake of God (Allah) and to offer more prayer than usual. Compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards by about eleven days each year depending on the moon; thus, a person will have fasted every day of the Gregorian calendar year in 34 years' time. Muslims believe Ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations of God to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.\n\nThere is No God but Allah, and the Prophet Mohammed is His Messenger!\n\nRamadan Kareem!\n\n\nFor questions, comments and suggestions related to \"Ramadan Live Wallpapers\" application please email me at creativeone1989@yahoo.com\nPlease rate the app if you like it - thanks!", "title": "Ramadan Live wallpaper", "publishedDate": "2012-07-17T15:48:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "622EDBkEk8w", "description": "21-term Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) has a lot of stories.

Conjuring back the swell of the sub-riff, and the power of \u2018Sacred Heart\u2019s newly introduced, super-elevating lead line, the two meet with force, floor-side producing a earth-shattering effect.\n\nLet no clubbers\u2019 trainer rubber go un-burnt! \u2018Sacred Heart\u2019 drops on download stores today!\n\nAs one of the most cutting-edge and enduringly innovative labels of the electronic music generation, VANDIT Records stays true to its philosophy \u2018No Art Without Artists\u2019. At the start of the 2000s VANDIT made immediate waves releasing a string of now established club classics like Nu-NRG\u2019s \u2018Dreamland\u2019, The Thrillseekers\u2019 \u2018Synaesthesia\u2019 and Jose Amnesia\u2019s \u2018The Eternal\u2019 to name just a few. With an artist talent pool of established names, such as Judge Jules, Alex M.O.R.P.H and founder Paul van Dyk himself as well as lots of gifted younger blood names they keep on bringing high-quality electronic music into the scene.\n\nOfficial HP: http://www.vandit.com\nVandit on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/VanditRecords\nFollow Vandit on Twitter: https://twitter.com/vanditrecords", "title": "Alex M.O.R.P.H. - Sacred Heart [Official Video]", "publishedDate": "2014-10-22T09:32:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "623sOwgckWQ", "description": "The Marc by Marc Jacobs Men's Spring/Summer 2015 collection ventures into a period of juvenile prosperity.

The central column of the bowl is positioned directly over the stem of the cup and over the hole at the bottom of the stem. A small open pipe runs from this hole almost to the top of the central column, where there is an open chamber. The chamber is connected by a second pipe to the bottom of the central column, where a hole in the column exposes the pipe to (the contents of) the bowl of the cup.\nWhen the cup is filled, liquid rises through the second pipe up to the chamber at the top of the central column, following Pascal's principle of communicating vessels. As long as the level of the liquid does not rise beyond the level of the chamber, the cup functions as normal. If the level rises farther however, the liquid spills through the chamber into the first pipe and out the bottom. Hydrostatic pressure then creates a siphon through the central column, causing the entire contents of the cup to be emptied through the hole at the bottom of the stem. Modern toilets operate on the same principle: when the water level in the bowl rises high enough, a siphon is created, flushing the toilet.\nPythagoras Cup Wiki : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_cup\n\nMaterials : Three Plastic Cup, CD(Drill a hole), two Straw(different thickness), two Coins, Lighter, Scissors, Hot glue", "title": "How to make a Pythagoras Cup (a.k.a greedy cup) [\uacc4\uc601\ubc30 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30]", "publishedDate": "2013-08-06T13:54:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "627WOIYjfhc", "description": "Page officielle : https://www.facebook.com/adilofficiel13\nCompte officiel : https://www.facebook.com/adildeuxiemecompte", "title": "A-DEAL Adil feat Kalif Hardcore //Tu fais peur a qui ?

Presenting the Skyzone Dual Antenna Video Goggle\n\nVideo Goggle is a funny gadget, it really gives you First Person View experience, it feels like watching a big TV few feet away from you in a very dark room, really gives you a cock-pit like feeling.\n\nWe like this Skyzone Dual Antenna Video Goggle a lot, it has Two 5.8Ghz Video Receiver built-in so you don't need to deal with any cable, this is one step forward from previous model. Compare with traditional FPV Video Monitors, sometimes we prefer Video Goggles because the goggle cover your eyes completely so you still get a good look on the video in daylight, this Skyzone video goggle has a soft rubber eye lid which feels very comfortable, shape is just right, it gives you a perfectly dark environment. If you don't want to put it on your head? That's fine, the goggle has AV output, just connect the output to any Monitor with AV Input, then you'll get video feeds on your monitor.\n\nOperation is super easy, just plug in the battery, select the same channel of your Video Transmitter on the drone, that's all! Best of all, we includes a battery for the goggle which other shops don't! Trust me, you need this battery, you don't want a long power cable coming out from the Video Goggle on your head.\n\nHidden Function - The Head Tracker\nActually the Skyzone Goggle has a Gyroscope inside, that means when you move your head it will convert your head movement into RC control signal and able to send out those signal. The Goggle came with a Futaba Control Cable, connect the goggle with your Futaba RC transmitter and take control of Three servo movement. Some serious players use this function to control a 3-Axis Gimbal (not Brushless Gimbals that we see on drones now-a-days, I mean the old school Servo Based Gimbal which we don't see anymore) in the RC plane cockpit and do real FPV, for any of you like to know more, please read the Skyzone Goggle manual, this is advanced RC stuff. Besides, base on what we've seen on the market, no drone gimbal will work with this Head Tracker function, so we don't bother to go in deeper.\n\nhttp://www.helipal.com/skyzone-dual-antenna-fpv-goggle.html", "title": "Skyzone Dual Antenna FPV Video Goggle - HeliPal.com", "publishedDate": "2014-05-23T13:05:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "628kiT4Cwfw", "description": "Die SchwabenCombo in der Erdinger Urweisse H\u00fctt'n in Lauingen am Hotel Kannenkeller.
