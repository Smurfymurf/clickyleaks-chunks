Weather condition force vessel construction to create critical sagging and hogging moments. Before Panama Channel is built, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (Cape Horn) was the only way to go from Atlantic to Pacific Ocean or Pacific to Atlantic Ocean. It was rough time for seaman who sail through this area and it was probably the most dangerous and feared place for sailors on earth. Polar storms and wild seas sink many cargo vessels, and more than 30000 people died sailing through extremely wild ocean weather with high monster waves, furious wind and strong current. In the past, only a few were lucky to survive undamaged through this wild place. Even now, it is a very dangerous area to sail. We sail through this horrible weather that will newer give you another chance if you make an even smallest mistake. But on the other side it was one great experience and I will be so empty if I didn't go through it and sense this unbelievable force of the nature. Sea in this area could be very rough with extremely strong wind. Passage around Cape Horn is one of the most challenging and hazardous shipping routes in the world. Southern 56\u00b0 latitude is home of the most furious winds that blow from west to east. Around Cape Horn it is going to force you from the starboard side of the ship. Engine blackout on rough sea might damage, brake and sink the biggest ship very fast. Ferry or Big ship will sink engine stop or blackout and vessel just float without control. This time, massive Ocean waves top over the ship deck and deck was completely under the water several times, ocean waves covered the deck for hours and we pray for the engine not to stop or blackout. Long and wide ship can go under water easier than medium size because of sagging-hogging bending moments. In this rough conditions is most important to stay calm and focused on keeping the good duty order on board with no panic or any other disruption. Keeping the course is very difficult since you have to avoid huge monster waves that can damage the vessel. Very important is to cut the waves under a certain angle.

Bhutan has taken special care to protect this species and has established the Phobjikha Conservation Area covering 163 square kilometres (63 sq mi) of the valley under the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature (RSPN) and for the purpose of conservation management. The conservation area was established by Bhutan in the Phobjika Valley in 2003, and RSPN has the mandate to protect not only the Black-necked Cranes but also 13 other vulnerable species. The cranes, which used to be hunted in Bhutan till 1980 are now totally protected, with the Government of Bhutan enacting a law under which any person killing a crane would invite life term jail sentence.\n\nIn Bhutan, the Black-necked Cranes have a celebrity status, as witnessed by the Crane Festival held every year on 12 November, soon after their arrival from the Tibetan Plateau, in the courtyards of the Gangten Gonpa in Phobjika Valley. Many tourists also visit the valley to witness this festival.\n\n It is 139 cm (55 in) long with a 235 cm (7.8 ft) wingspan, and it weighs 5.5 kg (12 lbs). It is whitish-gray, with a black head, red crown patch, black upper neck and legs, and white patch to the rear of the eye. It has black primaries and secondaries. Both sexes are similar. Some populations are known to make seasonal movements. It is revered in Buddhist traditions and culturally protected across much of its range. \n\nThe Black-necked Crane summers mainly in the high altitude Tibetan Plateau. The breeding areas are alpine meadows, lakeside and riverine marshes and river valleys. They also make use of barley and wheat fields in these areas. Wintering areas tend to be in sheltered valleys or lower altitudes. The largest populations are in China with smaller numbers extending into Vietnam, Bhutan and India. Small populations have been noted in northern Sikkim. A small group of 20 to 40 was once known to regularly visit the Subansiri area in the Apa Tani valley until 1975 and vagrants have been recorded in Nepal.\n\nCurrently, the Black-necked Crane winters in small numbers in two valleys of western Arunachal Pradesh, India. These are Sangti and Zemithang.\n\nBlack-necked Cranes forage on the ground in small groups, often with one bird acting as a sentinel. In winter, the groups arrive and leave the feeding grounds together, but may split into family groups, each group keeping their own small feeding territories in a big marshes or fields. They spend nearly 75% of the day foraging with peak feeding in the early morning and late afternoon.\n\nLike many other crane species, they are believed to form long-lasting pair bonds and dancing displays are made during the breeding season.The estimated population of the Black-necked Crane is between 8800 and 11000 individuals. These birds are legally protected in China, India and Bhutan. However habitat modification, drying of lakes and agriculture are threats to the populations.Populations in Bhutan are well protected both culturally and legally although some disturbance from tourism exists.\n\nThe Black-necked Crane is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

These causes include Runner's Knee or ITBS (Iliotibial Band Syndrome), Lateral Meniscus Tear, Patellofemoral Instability (Lateral Patella Tracking), PFPS (Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome), or Arthritis. These conditions often arise due to overuse and include inflammation or irritation of the structures that make up the lateral knee. Each of these conditions has its own well-established treatments that include rest, icing after activity, anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and strength training.\n\nITBS (Iliotibial Band Syndrome) -- ITBS is common in runners, hence the designation as Runner's Knee. However, it can be created by any movement that repeatedly causes the knee to pass back and forth across the 30 degree position. \nLateral Meniscus Tear -- Caused by over-rotation of the knee internally, hyper-extending or hyper-flexing the knee, or simply from overuse. The cartilage or meniscus becomes damaged towards the outside of the knee causing less integrity of the system that constitutes the lateral knee.\nPatellofemoral Instability (Lateral Patella Tracking) -- This condition occurs when the kneecap does not move up and down as it is supposed to do. The kneecap (patella) will track at an angle to the outside versus straight up and down. This results in injury to the surrounding tissue. Many athletes, primarily adolescent girls, commonly experience this condition.\nArthritis -- The cartilage in the knee degenerates and ceases to provide a smooth surface for bones to move along. The lubricating functionality of the joint is negatively affected and causes irregularities in the bone. \n\nProper diagnosis of the source of your pain is vital to creating a treatment plan to reduce pain and improve function. Your professional medical provider has the tools and expertise to diagnose and develop a treatment plan for your specific condition.\nKT Tape has been helpful for lateral knee pain, regardless of its source, through its ability to provide support without limiting mobility. KT Tape cues large muscle groups like the quadriceps to do their job in supporting knee movement. By creating surface tension on the skin over the area needing support, KT Tape creates a light, comfortable support structure that relieves pain and restores mobility.", "title": "KT Tape: Lateral Knee Pain", "publishedDate": "2010-07-14T02:01:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "8L-8fyelfXc", "description": "Video to accompany the Sales Development Representative job description.", "title": "Sales Development Representative Job Video", "publishedDate": "2012-07-24T14:13:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8L-Bk28Ra6Q", "description": "Track 20 of the Stardust soundtrack, by the amazing Ilan Eshkeri.

Come here, come and find me\nSweeter than the poison that I'm drinking from my ivy\nFiner than a woman with them curves, let me sight see\nAnd cooler than a bad bitch drinkin' on some iced tea\nLook at me and see, I'm going off to Hollywood \nCheers to the people who said man I thought he could\nMake it real big, live it large. Man, I probably should\nDedicate my life to the music and the common good (common good)\nAll I knew is one day I would make it \nI'm searching for the life, if they give it, I'ma take it\nUntil I found my passion, I felt like I was vacant\nIf you think I'm in for money then you surely are mistaken\nIf you think I'm lying here's a word to the wise \nYou can gain that money if it's worth all your time \nJust never live your life without purpose in mind\nI'm living my life free like a bird in the sky\nI'm never looking back because I live with no regrets\nIf you're thinking about hating then you better show respect, son\nIf you're a lady and you never show affection\nI can be your teacher and I'll show your ass a lesson\nAnd all this time it never did occur to me\nI got the skill to steal the game like a burglary\nI kill these beats, every song is like a murder scene\nI'm way outta this world, you could say I'm up in Mercury\nI never doubted me. You could say your proud of me \nIt never change the fact that I'm thinking rap hourly\nGive it all my hundred and that's what you'll get out of me\nI'm heading for the top and that's what your about to see\nI'm in a race and I'm striving for that gold\nAnd all I gotta say is ready, set, go\n\n[Bridge: Beach House]x6\nGo, g-go, go, go, go \n\n[Verse 2: Salience]\nYou can see me posing up in every single magazine\nRap is in my DNA, you can call it adenine \nI really couldn't care if the haters getting mad at me \nI'm never slowing down 'cause I'm stepping on the gasoline\nAll that really matters is sticking to the plan\nI couldn't live my dreams if it wasn't for my fans\nSo I gotta say thank you.

Wong Fei Hong (Chan) is a young master of the martial art of \"drunken boxing,\" in which fighters use alcohol to blind themselves to pain and release the angry brawler within; with the right amount of drinks under his belt, Hong can become a furious one-man army. Hong accompanies his father (Ti Lung) on a voyage to China, where they purchase a precious supply of ginseng. When Hong discovers thugs stealing from their luggage, he leaps into action to get their belongings back. Instead, he winds up with a box of valuable Chinese artifacts, which criminals are hoping to smuggle to England at a tremendous profit. Hong sets out to fight the gangsters and give the artifacts back to their rightful owners, but while his stepmother (Anita Mui) encourages him to use his drunken boxing skills, his father feels his boozy antics bring shame to the family. Jackie Chan brought some of his most elaborate stunt work to Drunken Master 2, including a remarkable fight on a bed of hot coals; Chan also directed part of the film, after Lau Kar Leung was fired after a number of disagreements with his star. Six years after it became a box office hit in Asia, Drunken Master 2 earned a theatrical release in the United States; the film was re-titled Legend Of The Drunken Master (in part because the original Drunken Master never had a proper theatrical release in America), re-edited, and dubbed into English, with a new score by Michael Wandmacher.\n\n\"the legend of drunken master\",\"jackie chan\",\"chia-liang liu\",\"axe videos\",\"cloth videos\",\"clothing videos\",\"stairs videos\",\"stick videos\",\"table videos\",\"window videos\",\"foreign action adventure\",\"foreign comedies\",foreign,\"hong kong\",\"martial arts\",\"leonard ho\",\"edward tang\",\"barbie tung\",\"eric tsang\",\"strength videos\",\"teamwork videos\",\"china videos\",\"restaurant videos\",\"wong fei hung\",\"general fu wen-chi\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++133441,/m/012d40,/m/07wwq2", "title": "The Legend of Drunken Master (8/12) Movie CLIP - Bamboo Smack Down (1994) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-02T01:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8LGhdhF04bs", "description": "POV Lily\n\nIch kam mir vor wie in einem von diesen romantischen und kitschigen Filmen, in dem die Prinzessin in Zeitlupe die Treppe herunter schreitet. In meinem Fall war das Harry wohl eher der Prinz und ich das Bauernm\u00e4dchen, in die er sich zuf\u00e4llig verliebt hatte- mit einem Unterschied: Harry war ganz sicher nicht in mich verliebt.\nUnd das machte mich irgendwie traurig. Traurig??? Ja, irgendwie schon...\nIch lie\u00df meinen Blick zum Treppenabsatz schweifen. Dort stand Harry, der mich angrinste. Ich musste kurz die Luft anhalten, und mein Herz machte einen Sprung. Er hatte einen schwarzen Anzug an, in dem er wirklich verboten gut aussah. Sein Haar war verwuschelt und lockig wie immer, trotzdem hatte ich das Gef\u00fchl, dass er irgendwas mit seinen Haaren gemacht hatte. Als ich bei ihm angekommen war, sagte er:\nH: Sch\u00f6n siehst du aus.\nMein Gesicht entschied sich daraufhin nat\u00fcrlich, gegen meinen Willen, die Farbe rot anzunehmen *-* \nLil: Danke...Du auch.\nHarry hielt mir ganz Gentleman-like den Arm hin, und ich hakte mich bei ihm ein. \nAls wir drau\u00dfen standen, stand schon ein teuer aussehendes Auto vor der Haust\u00fcr. Harry hielt mir die Autot\u00fcr des Beifahrersitzes auf, und ging dann um das Auto herum und setzte sich auf den Fahrersitz. Er startete das Auto.\nLil: Wo fahren wir eigentlich hin?\nH: Das wird eine \u00dcberraschung!\nW\u00e4hrend der Fahrt rutschte ich auf meinem Sitz hin und her. Eigentlich mochte ich ja \u00dcberraschungen, aber es beunruhigte mich, dass ich nicht wusste, was Harry vor hatte. Die Fahrt dauerte ziemlich lange. Pl\u00f6tzlich fuhr er rechts ran. Ich hatte gar keine Zeit mehr mich umzusehen, denn Harry band mir vorsichtig die Augen zu. Ich konnte f\u00fchlen, dass es ein Stofftuch war, aber sobald er mich vorsichtig aus dem Auto gelotst hatte, hatte ich keine Orientierung mehr.\nNach gef\u00fchlten 100 Stunden gef\u00fcllt mit vielen \u201eIst es noch lange?\" und \u201eNein, wir sind gleich da\" s. Nahm er mir endlich das Tuch ab. Was ich sah lie\u00df meinen Atem, mein Gehirn und mein Herz f\u00fcr einen Moment aussetzen, und 2 Sekunden sp\u00e4ter 3x so schnell weiter schlagen.\nAuf dem Boden lag unheimlich viel Sand. Es war, als ob jemand eine kleine Lichtung mit Sand gef\u00fcllt h\u00e4tte. In der Mitte der Lichtung stand ein gedeckter Tisch mit zwei St\u00fchlen. Von den B\u00e4umen her leuchteten viele kleine Lichter. Die Sonne ging gerade unter, was das Licht der Lichtung unheimlich romantisch wirken lie\u00df.\nH: Gef\u00e4llt es dir?\nLil: Es ist wundersch\u00f6n!\nEr l\u00e4chelte.\nH: Sch\u00f6n, dass es dir gef\u00e4llt.\nEr nahm wie schon vorhin meinen Arm und wir gingen durch den Sand auf den Tisch zu. Mir fiel auf, das unseren Weg entlang kleine Laternen in den Sand gesteckt standen.\nAm Tisch angekommen, schob er den Stuhl zur\u00fcck, sodass ich mich setzen konnte. Er l\u00e4chelte und setzte sich auf den gegen\u00fcberliegenden Stuhl. Trotz des Sandes und dem Vermutenten Waldbodens, wackelte die St\u00fchle und der Tisch kein bisschen. Da trat ein Kellner aus dem Wald hervor. Er kam auf uns zu und verteilte uns eine Karte. Nachdem Harry und ich dann bestellt hatten, unterhielten wir uns. Da kam mir ein Gedanke:\nLil: \u00e4hm.. .Harry?\nH: Ja?\nLil: Wei\u00df Louis eigentlich von unserem...Date? Ich meine er ist dein bester Freund... und mein Cousin.\nHarry sah mich leicht gequ\u00e4lt an.\nH: Ich konnte es ihm nicht sagen. Es f\u00e4llt mir schwer ihn anzul\u00fcgen, aber es musste sein. Er f\u00e4nde das n\u00e4mlich gar nicht gut...\nWir schwiegen. Hatte ich jetzt mit der Frage den Abend versaut?\nAber da kam schon das Essen. \nW\u00e4hrend des Essens sprachen wir miteinander. Er erfuhr eine Menge \u00fcber mich, und ich \u00fcber ihn. Wir hatten wirklich viele Gemeinsamkeiten. Als es sp\u00e4t wurde, standen wir auf. Ich nahm wieder seinen Arm, und wollte gerade einen Schritt gehen, als er mich pl\u00f6tzlich herumdrehte, sodass ich in seinen Armen war. Langsam beugte er sich herunter. Oh mein Gott ich glaube, ich sterbe!!! Er sah mir tief in die Augen. Dann zu meinem Mund, dann wieder Augen und als letztes wieder zu meinem Mund. Da schloss er die L\u00fccke zwischen uns, und k\u00fcsste mich. In mir fing ein Feuerwerk an. Wir standen bestimmt 10 min und k\u00fcssten uns.\n`````````````````````````````````\nJa, das war der Datepart :)\nHoffe er hat euch gefallen :)\n\nNialler wird heute 20!!! :D\nIch kann es immer noch nicht glauben :D\n\nIch war gestern in This is us!!!

It is one of the recognized Scheduled Tribes. The tribe was also known as Mazung in British India. Other Naga tribes know the Changs by different names including Changhai (Khiamniungan), Changru (Yimchunger), Duenching (upper Konyak), Machungrr (Ao), Mochumi (Sema) and Mojung (Konyak). According to oral tradition, the Changs emerged from a place called Changsangmongko, and later settled at Changsang. The word Chang is said to have derived the word chognu (banyan tree), after a mythical banyan tree that grew at the now-abandoned Changsang. Another theory says that the Chang migrated to present-day Nagaland from the east, and therefore call themselves Chang (\"Eastern\" in the local dialect) \"Chaang\" means \"East\" in Chang dialect.Some Changs also claim the Aos as their ancestors. The Chang folklore is similar to that of the Ao. \n\nThe Chang, like several other Naga tribes, practiced headhunting in the pre-British era. The person with maximum number of hunted heads was given the position of lakbou (chief), who would settle the village disputes. He was entitled to maintain special decorative marks in his house, and to wear special ceremonial dress during the festivals. After the headhunting was abolished, the village disputes were resolved by a council of informally elected village leaders. Such councils also selected the fields for jhum cultivation, and fixed the festival dates.The Changs constructed a platformed called \"Mullang Shon\" in the center of the village, which would serve as a public court. Issues such as village administration, cultivation, festivals, marriages and land boundaries were discussed on this platform.\n\nAs of 2001, about 99.5% of the Changs were Christians.However, the Chang tribals were originally animists. They believed in a continuity between the humans, the nature and the supernatural forces. They do not worship any family, clan or village deities. But, they believe in several nature spirits (water, sky, jungle etc.) The most important spirit is Sampule Mukhao (or Shambuli Muhgha), the spirit of the paddy field. Traditionally, the Ongbou (the village priest from the Ong clan) performed major sacrifices during the festivals. The Chang conversions to Christianity started in 1936, and the Chang Naga Baptist Association was formed in 1940.\n\nThe Changs speak the Chang language, which belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family. Nagamese is used for communicating with the outsiders. The educated Changs also speak English and Hindi languages.The traditional Chang society is patrilineal, and the males inherit the land and the positions of authority. Nuclear families are predominant in the Chang society. The marriage is called chumkanbu, and remarriages are permitted.Agriculture is the traditional occupation of the tribe, and jhum cultivation is practiced. Rice, millets, Job's Tears, pulses and vegetables are the main crops.Trade and business were practiced mainly as subsidiary occupations. The Changs carried out barter trade with the other tribes (Yimchungers, Khiamngan, Ao and Konyak), exchanging shawls and other garments for the things they needed. Crafts such as wood-carving, spinning, weaving, pottery and basketry are also pursued.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

Some flesh fly larvae are internal parasites of other insects. The majority of species in the large genus Sarcophaga are scavengers of small carrion, such as dead insects and snails or smaller vertebrates. A few species feed on larger vertebrate carcasses. Flesh fly maggots occasionally eat other larvae, although this is usually because the other larvae are smaller and get in the way. Flesh flies and their larvae are also known to eat decaying vegetable matter and excrement, and they may be found around compost piles and pit latrines.  Flesh flies can carry leprosy bacilli and can transmit intestinal pseudomyiasis to people who eat their larvae. Flesh flies, particularly Wohlfahrtia magnifica, can also cause myiasis in animals, mostly to sheep, and can give them blood poisoning, or asymptomatic leprosy infections.\n\nThe Diptera (\"di-ptera\" = two-winged) or \"true flies\" is the largest order of animals in the UK with around 7,000 known species and new ones being discovered every year. They are found in all habitats from the sea shore to mountain tops. Whilst some are agricultural pests or vectors of disease, the great majority are beneficial. They are extremely important as predators on other pests and diseases, as pollinators, as food for other animals and the immature stages of the bulk of the species are involved in the decay of organic matter and the recycling of material back into the soil. Entomologists who specialise in these insects are \"dipterists\". In 1993, a group of people who wanted to find out more about every aspect of their lives, including the habitats they require, set up the Dipterists Forum. There is a great deal still to learn about flies. Mapping the distribution of some groups is a major achievement of the Dipterists Forum to date, but the immature stages of the majority of species are still unknown. Many species are becoming increasingly rare as a result of habitat loss and climate change. See more: http://www.dipteristsforum.org.uk/ \n\nThe Diptera are the true flies. The Diptera is one of the largest orders in the class Insecta, with over 120,000 described species. The larvae (maggots or grubs) are completely different in structure and behaviour to the winged adults and, as a result, dipterous flies can be parasites as larvae or adults, but they are rarely parasites in both life-cycle stages. Adult flies of veterinary importance may feed on blood, sweat, skin secretions, tears, saliva, urine or faeces of the domestic animals to which they are attracted.

We see in this video why our goalie Zach (11 years old) is earning the big bucks!  First he foils a breakaway and sends the rebound to the far corner.  Our D-man Greg (8) takes possession and heads around behind the net with a Neanderthal in hot pursuit, but a beautiful long pass up ice finds Will (94) near the Neanderthal blue line; Will redirects the pass across to Al Herman (17), who carries the puck in.  Al Irvine (69) joins the fray.  The attack is thwarted, however, and the Neanderthals break out, with a long cross-ice pass (that Greg can't quite deflect) to Blue Legs (Yellow Gloves) who can't quite regain control after he does an amazing job of corralling the puck so he and the puck cross our blue line at the same time (check it out in slo mo!).  Zach sweeps the puck to the far corner, where Blue Legs grabs it and dipsy-doodles through the slot and lets go a quick backhand that Zach snags and smothers.

He had already worked out once for the Niners on Nov. 27 before they invited him back this time, as Harbaugh initially chose to stick with Akers.\n\nNow, Akers and Cundiff will compete to see who kicks in the team's NFC divisional playoff game in prime time Jan. 12 at Candlestick Park. San Francisco will play Green Bay, Seattle or Washington.\n\nThe 49ers cleared a spot on the 53-man roster for Cundiff by waiving linebacker Eric Bakhtiari. Players had Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday off before returning to practice Thursday -- so that will be the first look at both kickers together.\n\nCundiff spent the 2009-11 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, who are coached by Harbaugh's big brother, John. But Cundiff was cut after last season, when he missed a potential tying 32-yard field goal in the closing seconds of the AFC championship game that sent New England to the Super Bowl.\n\nJim Harbaugh said Monday he might keep two kickers on the roster and open up a competition.\n\n\"If we had two on the roster at the same time, then they can kick in practice,\" Harbaugh said. \"And that's an option. That's a possibility. I think there are three options. We go forward with David. We bring in a new kicker. Or, we have two and let them compete for the job. We'll make that decision as we go.\"\n\nAkers, who made 44 of 52 attempts in his sensational 2011 season and first year with San Francisco, is just 29 for 42 this year. He is only 7 for 13 from 40-49 yards and missed wide left twice from that range in Sunday's 27-13 victory against Arizona in the regular-season finale.\n\nThe 38-year-old Akers signed a three-year contract as arguably the 49ers' biggest offseason acquisition ahead of the 2011 season, aside from the hiring of Harbaugh. And he delivered at nearly every opportunity -- until recently.\n\nHe had a 21-yard attempt blocked by Red Bryant in a 42-13 loss at Seattle on Dec. 23, and Richard Sherman returned it 90 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThe 32-year-old Cundiff joins his sixth team in 10 NFL seasons. He has also played for Dallas, New Orleans and Cleveland.\n\nSource: http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8800961/billy-cundiff-signs-san-francisco-49ers-compete-david-akers", "title": "San Francisco 49ers sign placekicker Billy Cundiff (HD)", "publishedDate": "2013-01-05T08:23:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8LvIvZ_D_Wk", "description": "www.viverochaclacayo.com.pe", "title": "peruflora_2_www.viverochaclacayo.com.pe", "publishedDate": "2010-10-29T22:43:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "8LvMIxbwVQU", "description": "\u25b6 Previous video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2hzzC63DPA\n\u25b6 Submit your plays here: http://www.deviantimmortal.com/submit\n\nMusic & FX (in order):\n\u266b \"Fun In A Bottle\" by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com/)\n\u266b \"Hitman\" by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com/)\n\u266b \"Sad Romance\" by Thao Nguyen Xanh\n\u266b \"Ice Flow\" by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com/)\n\u266b Horse Sound FX by http://jinglepunks.com/\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u25b6 Website:  http://www.deviantimmortal.com\n\u25b6 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DeviantImmortal\n\u25b6 Twitter: https://twitter.com/DeviantImmortal\n\u25b6 Subscribe (it's free!): https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=DeviantImmortal\n\u25b6 Donate for better vids?

Both types feed on cellulose found in wood and wood products, but there are differences between the two species.\n\nDrywood termites do not need ground contact or moisture. They can live their entire life cycle inside a piece of structural timber or a piece of furniture. Their numbers are less than that of subterranean termites and they tend to be a bit larger in size. Drywood termites generally swarm after sunset or at night, from May until November. However, they can swarm at other times. Their swarmers are generally pale brown in color.\n\nSubterranean termites must have ground contact or a secondary moisture source in order to live above ground. Most are small and black in the swarmer phase. Subterranean termites generally swarm during the spring and summer months in the daytime (especially after a heavy rain).

They consist of founding members Dave Chandler (guitarist) and Mark Adams (bass), alongside legendary hard-rock icon Scott Weinrich and recently-added drummer Henry Vasquez.

As of 2011, they have released seven studio albums.\n\nAfter breaking up in 1996, Saint Vitus reunited again in 2008 with the band's classic line-up,  and embarked on a successful tour. After 31 years in the band, Acosta was replaced by Henry Vasquez.

He continued his last season's performance and scored a dashing 35 runs before getting out to a tough call.

Tellurium is soft on the one hand, and very brittle on the other; thus, it can be processed perfectly to powder. It was discovered in 1782 by the Austrian chemist and mineralogist Franz Joseph Mu\u0308ller von Reichenstein, who at first considered it to be \u201esulphurised bismuth\". It was only in 1797, the Berlin chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth could verify the discovery. Klaproth was a renowned luminary, a man who also discovered uranium, zirconium and cerium and gave the name tellurium to the raw material discovered by Mueller von Reichenstein. He wrote: \u201eTo fill this existing gap in the chemical mineralogy, I put forward my experiments and experience with these precious ores, whose main result lies in the discovery and validation of a new peculiar metal, for which I have given the name tellurium, based on our ancient mother earth. Four major manufacturing plants for tellurium have been set up to date; they jointly supply two thirds of the market: The United States, Canada, Japan and Peru. Estimated overall world production is about 180 tonnes per year. But, why is tellurium needed at all? Traditionally, it is important as an alloying element for the cable industry and steel production. It comes in coatings for DVD and Blue-ray discs, as well as in semiconductors; preferably in the field of Photovoltaics, namely in the conversion of solar energy into electricity: Solar systems. And even in some fireworks one can admire it when the salts of tellurium render a grass-like green colour.\n\nBut not only because of the future-proof application methods and the splendid fireworks it is indispensable: Merely because of its beautiful name, the element deserved its discovery in 1782: Tellurium.\n\nFor more information, visit: www.swissmetal.net", "title": "TELLURIUM - Swissmetal Inc.", "publishedDate": "2013-07-18T17:45:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MIrjA4sHqE", "description": "At the Exhibit, Balham", "title": "The Friday Band perform \"Sceneshifter\"", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T22:48:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MJI2D25Cc0", "description": "\"Earthing\" is the concept of touching the earth for anti-oxidant healing benefits and is used by many such as athletes and alternative doctors to help heal in the event of an injury. \nFor more videos like this, please visit www.TheArtofUnity.com\n\nFind links here - http://www.theartofunity.com/products/earthing-mat-cover-book-tester-kit/\n\nwww.TheArtofUnity.com", "title": "Earthing - What is it and How to do it?", "publishedDate": "2013-07-04T06:04:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MJcsqI167U", "description": "", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0641\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0648\u062c\u0641\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0644\u0642\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u064a", "publishedDate": "2012-05-27T17:43:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MK-n52ae8k", "description": "I have always wanted to see a Whirling Dervish so this is a small part of a very long performance by an Arabian Dancer at a Desert Camp we were taken to following a Dune Bashing excursion by  Desert Adventures.\n\nWhere to stay?

During pyrolysys, gasses such as hydrogen and methane are released from the fabric, and can be ignited and burned. \n\nThe process of making char cloth is very similar to making wood gas, and the gas released can be captured and burned as fuel.\n\nChar cloth can be ignited by a single spark, that can in turn be used to ignite a tinder bundle to start a fire.

Pakula\nScreenwriter: Harper Lee, Horton Foote\nFilm Description: Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiographical novel was translated to film in 1962 by Horton Foote and the producer/director team of Robert Mulligan and Alan J. Pakula. Set a small Alabama town in the 1930s, the story focuses on scrupulously honest, highly respected lawyer Atticus Finch, magnificently embodied by Gregory Peck. Finch puts his career on the line when he agrees to represent Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man accused of rape. The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter Scout (Mary Badham). While Robinson's trial gives the film its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scout's ever-strengthening bond with older brother Jem (Philip Alford), her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris (a character based on Lee's childhood chum Truman Capote and played by John Megna), her father's no-nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scout's reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in his movie debut), the reclusive \"village idiot\" who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot.

Choice breeds competition, and competition breeds better products and services.\n\nThere was a time in our country when people had no choice when it came to the energy they were going to pay for. There was usually one company that offered power, and they set the prices they wanted to charge. With the deregulation of energy, that is all changing. States are adopting this practice to allow consumers to go out and shop for the best energy package they can find. This gives people the choice and freedom they deserve to pay for the energy that they want to use.\n\nNot every state has adopted energy deregulation. In states that have adopted the policy, many have had it written into law through their legislators. The choice, in some cases, goes beyond just which company people can buy their energy from. In some states, people are allowed to choose from public and privately owned companies, and companies that offer alternative types of energy. People that are interested in their options should contact their state government to see what their choices are.\n\nThe ability to choose the energy supplier has given consumers many benefits besides finding the best price. Consumers are becoming much smarter about how they use energy, and the type of company they buy it from. Some people might have a problem buying energy from a company that burns coal, so they can opt to go with a company that uses a cleaner or more efficient method. This is creating communities of people that are much more savvy about energy use. That is a good thing for our entire country, and our planet.\n\nA final thought to ponder about electricity deregulation is the recourse that consumers have if they are not happy with their energy provider. Choice gives them the ability to simply switch companies and find someone that meets their needs in a more satisfactory way. This competition is good for everyone because it holds energy companies accountable for putting forth a quality company. Choice is what our country is all about, and this is an example of choice in action.\n\nTags:\nderegulation, energy power, electricity, electric deregulation, Energy Deregulation, electricity deregulation scam, california deregulation scam, ontario deregulation, Texas deregulation, scam power, global warming, green energy, climate change, solar energy, California,Texas, Clean Environment, Free Wind Generator, Black Box Media, The Electric Choice, History of Energy Deregulation\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MnTXFkRHHM", "title": "Energy Deregulation | Benefits of Energy Deregulation", "publishedDate": "2012-06-05T19:55:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MnV5w-Wmq4", "description": "Seth Macfarlane brings us his 2nd feature film set in the \"wild west\"....it could be a fun ride, if it's not a completely boring mess of misfires.

Molen, Walter F. Parkes, Ronald Shusett\nScreenwriter: Philip K. Dick, Scott Frank\nFilm Description: Based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, this science fiction-thriller reflects the writer's familiar preoccupation with themes of concealed identity and mind control. Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a Washington, D.C. detective in the year 2054. Anderton works for \"Precrime,\" a special unit of the police department that arrests murderers before they have committed the actual crime. Precrime bases its work on the visions of three psychics or \"precogs\" whose prophecies of future events are never in error. When Anderton discovers that he has been identified as the future killer of a man he's never met, he is forced to become a fugitive from his own colleagues as he tries to uncover the mystery of the victim-to-be's identity. When he kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the precogs, he begins to formulate a theory about a possible frame-up from within his own department. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who hired a team of futurists to devise the film's numerous technologically advanced gadgets, Minority Report co-stars Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Neal McDonough.\n\n\"minority report\",\"minority report clip\",\"minority report part 1\",\"minority report full movie\",\"tom cruise\",\"samantha morton\",\"mike binder\",\"steven spielberg\",\"gun videos\",\"watch videos\",\"action thrillers\",\"sci-fi thrillers\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"crime action\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"walter f parkes\",\"gerald r molen\",\"michael doven\",\"jan de bont\",\"ronald shusett\",\"gary goldman\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++262610,/m/08jp1f,/m/07r1h,/m/02d42t", "title": "Minority Report (5/9) Movie CLIP - Anderton Chooses Not to Kill (2002) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-11T23:39:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Muofx7jEZk", "description": "Treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction by balloon dilation\nTraitement des pathologies de la trompe d'Eustache par dilatation", "title": "dilatation trompe d'Eustache - tuboplastie - balloon dilation of auditory tube", "publishedDate": "2012-09-19T17:20:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MvmDYQk1fs", "description": "Yezo bicando com o dedo!!!", "title": "06-12-08_1739 Yezo.3gp", "publishedDate": "2010-07-20T14:33:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Mvr3opF8eE", "description": "Sorry For The Lack of Uploads, My Arm Has Been Bothering Me Causing Me Not To Be Able To Record.\nHope You Enjoy", "title": "My Arm Is Causing Lack of Uploads", "publishedDate": "2013-08-08T14:14:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8MwA9MG6Vgw", "description": "My favorite OST.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "EnjOY\u0130NG  2015's HD !!

(The botanical Latin for it is Maclura pomifera.) This is a great deciduous drought-resistant tree, although I have noticed it does tend to become a bit of a weed around rivers and creeks. Like cactus, it was once a very important living fence--before barbed wire was invented. It does have quite a few thorns that have to be watched out for. This thorny tree is appreciated by birds who want a peaceful and safe roost that cats will avoid. \n\nThe orange wood is used for woodturning. The roots are orange, too, and yield an orange dye. I recall the Osage Indians used the wood to make either bows or arrows. I can't remember which, at present. I suppose they used the dye for fabrics and things, too--like to make those colourful and attractive Indian blankets with. \n\nThe leaves can be used as food for silkworms when mulberry leaves are in short supply. (Osage Orange trees are related to other milky species like mulberry, figs, and breadfruit.) Great, shapely, leafy and shady tree. Pity the fruits are inedible. Maybe all the latex in the large fruits could be used to make rubber--as has been done with dandelion milk?\n\n\n.....", "title": "My Osage Orange Tree", "publishedDate": "2010-12-28T21:02:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "8N6rHdlmq0E", "description": "\u6bcf\u6b21\u628a\u624b\u4f38\u904e\u53bb\u90fd\u6703\u81ea\u5df1\u722c\u4e0a\u4f86", "title": "\u8df3\u9f20\u65e5\u8a18(Gerbillus):\u4f86\u624b\u624b", "publishedDate": "2012-07-31T15:58:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8N7-wRWg7FU", "description": "Get it on iTunes:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-very-last-songs-i-will/id379861243\n\nLYRICS\n\nMonkey chicken chicken,\nMonkey Chicken, duck duck,\nChicken monkey monkey, Chicken Monkey,\nchicken chicken monkey duck.\nMonkey duck,\nChicken duck,\nMonkey monkey duck duck,\nChicken Monkey, chicken chicken monkey,\n\"Chicken Monkey Duck.\"\n\nChicken chicken monkey duck,\nChicken Monkey, duck duck,\nChicken chicken monkey,\nChicken monkey,\nChicken duck.\nChicken duck duck,\nChicken monkey monkey duck,\n\"Chicken Monkey Duck?\"\nChicken duck.\nMonkey duck duck:\nChicken chicken, monkey,\nChicken, monkey monkey, Chicken Monkey.\nChicken chicken monkey?\nChicken, monkey monkey,\n\"Chicken Monkey Duck.\"\n\nChicken chicken, monkey,\n\"Chicken Monkey Duck.\"\nChicken chicken, duck.\nChicken Monkey, monkey,\nChicken Monkey\u2014chicken duck.\n\nDuck, Chicken Monkey\nChicken chicken monkey, chicken.\nDuck duck,\nChicken chicken, duck.\nChicken, monkey monkey...\nChicken!\n\nDuck duck, Chicken Monkey,\nChicken chicken, monkey.\nChicken Chicken (monkey monkey),\nChicken monkey,\n\"Chicken Monkey Duck.\"\n\nChicken chicken chicken,\nMonkey monkey,\nChicken Monkey:\nDuck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck,\n\"Goose.\"\n\nThe Album:\niTunes \u2014 http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-very-last-songs-i-will/id379861243\n\nBandcamp \u2014 http://music.mikephirman.com", "title": "Chicken Monkey Duck", "publishedDate": "2010-05-16T21:59:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "8N766RI-qEc", "description": "", "title": "The North Face Himalayan Parka", "publishedDate": "2010-09-26T08:29:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "8N7Kqw6gZ0Q", "description": "", "title": "Consommateur Dholl puri", "publishedDate": "2014-06-09T05:48:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "8N7PB12Xefg", "description": "The BRYAN\u00ae Cervical Disc is indicated in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction\nof the disc from C3-C7 following single-level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy\nand/or myelopathy.

The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Discover The Best Way to Learn Hindi - Learn To Speak Hindi Fast and Easy", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T12:38:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NGrpt_XSK8", "description": "Who were the Scythians?

In popular culture, they are portrayed as freedom-loving riders of the steppes. Some believe they were the first Russians, a \"pure\" race of noble warriors. Recently, infrared light shone on their blackened skin revealed strange tattoos. What do these tattoos tell us about the true identity of the Scythians?\n \nMuseum Secrets is a hit TV series and rich media website that travels to the world's extraordinary museums, revealing the stories of irreplaceable treasures, probing familiar legends and assumptions, and using cutting edge research and technology to investigate the unknown.

Osborne\nScreenwriter: Don Mancini, John Lafia, Tom Holland\nFilm Description: Child's Play seems to have been concocted by a parent who went berserk after standing in line for hours on end to purchase a Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980s. The film opens with serial killer Brad Dourif taking refuge in a doll factory. Dourif is killed by the cops, but not before he has invoked a voodoo curse which transfers his soul into one of the dolls. That particular doll, nicknamed Chuckie, is unwittingly purchased by Catherine Hicks for her son Alex Vincent. Several murders occur shortly thereafter; all evidence points to Alex, who insists that his cherub-faced doll is responsible. Detective Chris Sarandon, the man responsible for Dourif's death, doesn't swallow Alex's story, but he agrees to investigate because he's sweet on Alex's mom. The slasher-flick ending of Child's Play would seem to have settled Chuckie's hash for good and all, but guess again--the film spawned numerous sequels.\n\n\"child's play\",\"child's play clip\",\"child's play full movie\",\"child's play 3\",\"child's play trailer\",\"child's play 2 full movie\",\"child's play 3 full movie\",\"child's play 2 trailer\",\"child's play remake\",\"child's play 1\",\"laura moskowitz\",\"alex vincent\",horror,\"preparation videos\",\"tom holland\",\"david kirschner\",\"elliot geisinger\",\"building videos\",\"andy barclay\",\"barrie m osborne\",\"slashers and serial killers\",\"cult horror\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++++9230,/m/0696j1", "title": "Child's Play (2/12) Movie CLIP - Chucky Blows Up Eddie (1988) HD", "publishedDate": "2013-10-21T21:07:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NP0FYyynRY", "description": "The statistics are that Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women of childbearing age, personally I think the numbers should be much higher because I think the condition often goes unrecognized and undiagnosed.  I think current diets and lifestyles are making the condition more prevalent.  Higher than normal blood sugar levels interfere with normal egg development each month. These improperly developed eggs can remain on the ovary as a cyst. Since ovulation is either delayed or doesn't occur at all, the hormone progesterone is either reduced or absent in that cycle, leading to many of the symptoms of PCOS. Lack of progesterone leads to a relative imbalance between estrogen and progesterone so that estrogen's activity isn't balanced out properly by progesterone; this is referred to as estrogen dominance. The two hormones tend to have equal and opposite functions: estrogen causes proliferation of the lining of the uterus, while progesterone helps maintain it, estrogen causes proliferation of breast tissue while progesterone keeps it healthy, estrogen tends to provoke emotions like sadness and progesterone had anti-depressant qualities. Progesterone reduces spasm of smooth muscle, normalizes clotting and vascular strength, helps thyroid function and bone building and helps prevent endometrial cancer. PCOS women have more circulating, active testosterone to cause problems like anovulation, infertility, acne, excess body and facial hair growth and loss of head hair. Regulation of dietary starch and sugar intake can greatly improve symptoms of PCOS including infertility, hair loss, weight gain, absence of regular periods, lack of ovulation, and facial hair growth. PCOS is not an infertility sentence and can be treated naturally through diet, exercise and nutritional supplements.  Aside from the fact that naturopathic medicine addresses the underlying cause of the disease, many women cannot tolerate the side effects of the conventional drug metformin and so naturopathic treatment offers a much more viable solution. \nArticle Source: http://www.naturopathtoronto.ca/PCOS.htm\nImage Source: http://www.victoriaosullivan.com.au", "title": "PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome): Myths, Facts and Natural Treatment", "publishedDate": "2013-04-24T01:48:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NPkY4umQ9A", "description": "Jeremiah 43\n\n\n1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,\n2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:\n3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.\n4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.\n5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;\n6 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar--adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.\n7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.\n8 \u00b6Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,\n9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;\n10 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.\n11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.\n12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.\n13 He shall break also the images of Beth--shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.", "title": "Jeremiah 43 (King James Holy Bible)", "publishedDate": "2010-07-28T01:46:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NQ3HcnSG1E", "description": "Rare voice-box and windpipe transplant successful. Following a rare 18-hour surgery, 52-year-old Ms. Brenda Jensen of the USA is able to speak for the first time in 11 years. Doctors at the University of California-Davis Medical Center announced the success of the complex surgery this week. The operation, which took place in October 2010, was the first ever in which both a voicebox and windpipe were transplanted, and only the second for a voicebox alone. Prior to the procedure, Ms. Jensen had spent the previous 11 years breathing only through a hole in her windpipe and relying on an electronic voice box to be able to speak. In addition to restoring her normal voice, the procedure also returned her ability to smell and taste. Ms Jensen said, \"This operation has restored my life. I feel so blessed to have been given this opportunity. It is a miracle, I'm talking, talking, talking, which just amazes my friends and family.\" Doctors say this pioneering achievement could also pave the way for other improvements in transplant technology. \n\nOur congratulatory salute, medical team at University of California-Davis Medical Center, for your pioneering success.

The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it excludes dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales). This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale. The other Cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), comprises filter feeders that eat small organisms caught by straining seawater through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen. This suborder includes the blue whale, the humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes) on top of the head.\nLike all mammals, whales breathe air, are warm-blooded, nurse their young with milk from mammary glands, and have body hair. Beneath the skin lies a layer of fat called blubber, which stores energy and insulates the body. Whales have a spinal column, a vestigial pelvic bone, and a four-chambered heart. The neck vertebrae are typically fused, trading flexibility for stability during swimming.\nWhales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one. These are located on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain almost completely submerged while breathing. Breathing involves expelling stale air (which is warm and moist), as well as some mucus and excess water from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among species and help with identification.\nThe body shape is fusiform and the modified forelimbs, or fins, are paddle-shaped. The end of the tail is composed of two flukes, which propel the animal by vertical movement, as opposed to the horizontal movement of a fish tail. Although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some (such as sperm whales and baleen whales) possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may have feet and digits. Most species have a dorsal fin.\nThe whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance matcher between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. However, in aquatic mammals, such as whales, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.\nSoundtrack - \"Whales of Baja\" - Written, Composed, Performed, and Produced on an Ensoniq TS10 Keyboard by Samuel Cernuto", "title": "Whales - (Images)", "publishedDate": "2014-06-14T05:53:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NVvmPubnqU", "description": "JazzAndBluesExperience - (Re)Discover the Jazz and Blues greatest hits - JazznBluesExperience is your channel for all the best jazz and blues music.

In this sequel, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) summons chaos theorist and onetime colleague Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to his home with some startling information -- while nearly everything at his Jurassic Park had been destroyed, engineers were also operating a second site, where other dinosaurs, resurrected through DNA cloning technology, had been kept in hiding. Hammond has learned the dinosaurs on the second island are alive and well and even breeding; Hammond wants Malcolm to observe and document the reptiles before Hammond's financiers can get to them. Malcolm declares he had enough of the dinosaurs the first time out, but decides to make the trip when he finds out that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is already there. However, Ian and Sarah aren't the only visitors expected on the island; a camera crew led by ecological activist Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) is on the way, as is Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), a world-class wild game hunter who is supposed to round up the dinosaurs and who hopes to bag a prehistoric trophy for himself in the process. This sequel to Jurassic Park boasted even more impressive special effects than the first film, though the acting and screenplay aren't always at the same level.\n\n\"the lost world jurassic park\",\"arliss howard\",\"pete postlethwaite\",\"thomas f duffy\",\"steven spielberg\",\"motorcycle videos\",\"action sci-fi fantasy\",blockbusters,\"dramas based on bestsellers\",\"dramas based on the book\",\"sci-fi fantasy\",\"sci-fi adventure\",\"gerald r molen\",\"authority videos\",\"sportsmanship videos\",\"strength videos\",\"success videos\",\"survival videos\",\"island videos\",\"jungle videos\",\"roland tembo\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++154934,/m/0cct39c,/m/0cyp0k,/m/018swb", "title": "The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1/10) Movie CLIP - The InGen Team Arrives (1997) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-28T06:00:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Nac1AMfvOE", "description": "Veterans know how it can be to interview for a civilian company.

After we have completed the germination process our seeds will be put in a 10\" x 20\" wheatgrass tray, so we are using 2 cups of wheatgrass seeds for this demonstration. \n\nIf you will be using a 10\" x 10\" tray use 1 \u00bd cups of seed, and if you are using a 17\" x 17\" tray, you will need to use 2 \u00bd cups of seeds for this beginning process. \n\nFirst, pour the wheatgrass seed in the wheatgrass sprouting jar. The jar is really just a large mason jar with a screen on it, so really anything similar will work.\n\nFill the jar with 70 degree water, about \u00be of the way full. Shake the jar vigorously for about 10 seconds to thoroughly mix the wheat grass seed and water. Take off the lid and look for any floating seeds; these are dead and won't germinate. You'll typically find a few bugs in your seed, which most of the time will be dead. Using a turkey baster or your hand, remove the dead seeds and/or bugs. Put the lid back on the jar and dump out the water then repeat this step 3 times, or until you think all the dirt, dust, and debris is gone, and the dead seeds and bugs have been removed.\n\nNext, fill the jar about \u00be of the way full with 70 degree water, making sure all the seeds are completely covered and put the lid back on. This will hydrate the seeds and make them germinate faster. \n\nLastly, put the jar in a dark spot for 8 -- 12 hours. \n\nThis completes the first steps of wheatgrass germination.", "title": "How To Germinate, Grow And Sprout Wheatgrass Seeds - Part 1", "publishedDate": "2012-04-12T02:58:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "8NhkE9VlgxY", "description": "Emma Watson (Harry Potter, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Noah) accepts the Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year presented by Burberry.

Have you wondered why others are blessed, while the Lord continues to allow suffering, disappointment, and hardship in your life?\nScripture records the stories of faithful believers who were able to maintain their hope in the midst of painful circumstances. The apostle Paul is a perfect example. He experienced persecution, beatings, unfair trials, imprisonment, and sickness, among other frustrations. Lets explore what he discovered about rising above adversity.\n\n1. Fulfillment in life does not hinge on our circumstances.\n\n   1. A change in scenery will never bring lasting joy. Some people believe that personal contentment is linked to ones circumstances. Consequently, when they become frustrated with life, they might quit their job, sell their house, divorce their spouse, or buy a new car. A little while later, they begin to feel unsatisfied again.\n\n          * Have you ever believed a certain circumstance would bring you contentment, and then been disappointed when it arrived and didnt satisfy? Describe the situation and how you felt.\n\n          * From this experience, what did you learn and how can you apply that to your current circumstances?\n\n       \n   2. Paul discovered that the secret to contentment was not found in things, but in a Person (Phil. 4:11-12). As believers, we find joy in our relationship with the Lord, not in our circumstances.\n\n          * What hardships did Paul experience, according to 2 Corinthians 11:24-27?\n\n          * Having experienced all that, why did Paul say he was content? Read 2 Corinthians 12:10 and Romans 15:13.\n\n    God can show us how to be satisfied, regardless of our circumstances, if we will rely on Him. When we dont find our joy in the Lord, well spend the majority of our time trying to improve circumstances (or escape trial) rather than serving Christ.\n\n2. Gods grace is sufficient during adversity.\n\n   1. Paul discovered that Gods power is most evident when we are weak. God did not remove Pauls thorn. But what the Lord gave him was far better in the long run. God granted Paul the grace he needed to endure his hardship victoriously (2 Corinthians 12:9). Weakness forces us to depend on Gods power.  \n\n          * Have you ever experienced Gods power at a time when you had little strength of your own? If so, describe that situation.\n\n       \n   2. Gods grace is more than sufficient for anything we will encounter. Paul left his home and family to plant churches in hostile environments, and as a result, he was persecuted, imprisoned, stoned, and left for dead. Yet, somehow he was content.  \n\n          * In what area of life do you need Gods strength?\n\n          * Write a prayer, asking God to show you how to depend on His strength to overcome this difficulty or weakness.\n\n \n\n3. The key to advancing through adversity is to view it as suffering for Christs sake.\n\n   1. Paul understood his purpose in life\u2014to bring glory to God by preaching the gospel. Therefore, anything that happened to him in the process of obeying God was really for Christs sake. He wrote:\n\n    Therefore, I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christs sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong (2 Cor. 12:10).\n\n          o Think about a recent hardship or disappointment in your life. How does the point above give you a new perspective on that trial?\n\n \n\n   1. Like Pauls mission in life, yours is to glorify God through spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ. This doesnt mean that youll necessarily serve God full-time vocationally. But when you become consumed by His call, everything will take on new significance. You will begin to see every facet of your life\u2014including pain\u2014as a means through which God can work to bring others to Him.  \n\n          * God may choose to delay your deliverance so He can use your suffering for His sake\u2014either now or in the future. What hardship are you currently experiencing?\n\n\n          * How can others see Christ in you through that situation?\n\n\nClosing: Gods grace is sufficient for whatever youre facing. If youll draw near to Him, suffering will ultimately bear spiritual fruit in your life and in the lives of others. As part of the Fathers divine plan, you can experience hope and joy, regardless of your circumstances.\n\nPrayer:  Father, how grateful we are that You accept us where we are. You can use every experience of our lives. Teach us to find hope in You. Make us effective vessels through whom others will find You as their Savior. In Jesus name I pray.

All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus  These langurs are largely gray (some more yellowish), with a black face and ears. Externally, the various species mainly differ in the darkness of the hands and feet, the overall color and the presence or absence of a crest.[2][3] There are also significant variations in the size depending on the sex, with the male always larger than the female.Gray langurs are primarily herbivores. However, unlike some other colobines they do not depend on leaves and leaf buds of herbs, but will as eat also coniferous needles and cones, fruits and fruit buds, evergreen petioles, shoots and roots, seeds, grass, bamboo, fern rhizomes, mosses, and lichens. Leaves of trees and shrubs rank at the top of preferred food, followed by herbs and grasses. Non-plant material consumed include spider webs, termite mounds and insect larvae.[18] They forage on agricultural crops and other human foods, and even accept handouts.[19] Although they occasionally drink, langurs get most of their water from the moisture in their food.[In one-male groups, the resident male is usually the sole breeder of the females and sires all the young. In multiple-male groups, the highest-ranking male fathers most of the offspring, followed by the next-ranking males and even outside males will father young.Higher-ranking females are more reproductively successful than lower-ranking ones.Female grey langurs do not make it obvious that they are in estrous. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the reproduction state of females.Females signal that they are ready to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions.[35] Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members] Females have even been recorded mounting other females.[Infanticide is common among gray langurs. Most infanticidal langurs are males that have recently immigrated to a group and driven out the prior male. These males only kill infants that are not their own.[37] Infanticide is more commonly reported in one-male groups, perhaps because one male monopolizing matings drives the evolution of this trait. In multiple-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males are likely to be high as the other males may protect the infants and they can't ensure that they'll sire young with other males around. Nevertheless, infanticide does occur in these groups, and is suggested that such practices serve to return a female to estrous and gain the opportunity to mate.Females usually give birth to a single infant, although twins do occur. Most births occur during the night.[39] Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attach themselves to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep.They do not move much in terms of locomotion for the first two weeks of their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more.They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.", "title": "New Born Child With Mother Grey Monkey Closeup Activity", "publishedDate": "2013-05-05T09:39:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OASXFm2bLs", "description": "Please visit us at: http://www.pushthemessage.com\nSay NO TO JAILS!!!\n#ReadingLiteracy\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Pursuant to 17 USC \u00a7 107: Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\"", "title": "H.

The orange, white and green colours looked beautiful on our papers and it was fun to recall them during an office tea break.\nAs we all share our experiences, we realize that our colleague Bhavesh who has been blind since birth has never known what colouring is all about. He has never touched a crayon, never coloured an Indian flag, never experienced the joy of colouring! Priti, who has low vision shared that though she has tried colouring, the colours always came out of the lines as they were not clearly visible for her.\nOut of the 100 million disabled in our country, 20 millions are such that they have never held a crayon or have experienced colouring due to visual impairment. The question that came in mind was, is it not possible for a blind person or a person with visual impairment to enjoy colouring just as you and me?\nThis Independence Day let's bring the joy of colouring for them with the BarrierBreak (www.barrierbreak.com) initiative -- Colour of Independence. Colour of Independence Kit is a set of Raised Colouring Book and Braille Crayons that would give a person with visual impairment the freedom to colour various objects such as the Indian National flag, a kite, a flower, a mango and a house on their own.

She is the female counterpart without whom the male aspect, which represents consciousness or discrimination, remains impotent and void. Goddess worship is an integral part of Hinduism.\nDevi is, quintessentially, the core form of every Hindu Goddess. As the female manifestation of the supreme lord, she is also called Prakriti, as she balances out the male aspect of the divine addressed Purusha.[2]\nDevi is the supreme Being in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, while in the Smartha tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of God.[3][4] In other Hindu traditions of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, Devi embodies the active energy and power of male deities (Purushas), such as Vishnu in Vaishnavism or Shiva in Shaivism. Vishnu's shakti counterpart is called Lakshmi, with Parvati being the female shakti of Shiva.\nDurga:  In the Hindu pantheon, Durga is one of the most popular goddesses, and her creation takes place in the context of a cosmic crisis. The asuras were on the ascent, and they had become a threat to cosmic stability. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue them. A number of male gods having failed to subdue the demons led by Mahishasura, assembled into a conclave and emitted their energies together which took the form of the warrior goddess, Durga, that is, the invincible.Saraswati::She is the goddess of speech and learning, and is the creator of Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas. She is the consort of Brahma, the creator and member of the Hindu Trinity. She is equally revered by Hindus, Jains and the Buddhists. Her iconography depicts her association with art, science and culture, which is dramatically different from some other major goddesses who are identified with fertility, wealth, and battles. She is shown as having four arms, and the most common items held by her in her hands are a book, a vina (lute), a mala, and a water pot. The book signified art, science and learning; the vina associates her with music and performing arts; and the prayer beads and water pot signify her association with religious rites. She is worshipped on the fifth day of the spring according to Hindu calendar, called the Basant Panchami.Shri-Lakshmi:...Shri, commonly known as Lakshmi and also called Shri Lakshmi, is one of the most popular and widely worshipped Devi in Hindu tradition since pre-Buddhist period. Her name is the basis for \"Lady Luck (Lakshmi)\" in the Christian West[citation needed]and her form of rising from water is depicted as Venus. She has a considerable body of mythology and history. The earliest legend states that Shri is born as a result of austerities of Prajapati, and she represents ten qualities and objects, namely, food, royal power, universal sovereignty, knowledge, power, holy luster, kingdom, fortune, bounteousness, and beauty.Kali:....Kali is one of the most significant divinities, and many texts and contexts treat Kali as an independent deity, not directly associated with a male god. In case she is associated with a male god, it is invariably Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time.Navadurga::...Navadurga (Devanagari: \u0928\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e), which literally means nine Durgas, constitute, according to Hindu mythology, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. Navadurga are famously worshipped during the Autumn Navaratri or the Nine days, initiating the devotees into a period of festivities according to Hindu calendar.Mahavidya ::;...Mahavidyas, that is, the supreme knowledge, revelations and manifestations, refer to a group of ten goddesses. They constitute an important aspect of Mahadevi theology, which emphasizes that the Devi has a tendency to manifest and display herself in a variety of forms and aspects.Ten Mahavidyas are: Kali, Tara, Chinnamasta, Bhuvanesvari, Bagla, Dhumavati, Kamla, Matangi, Sodasi, and Bhairavi.\nParvati:...Parvati is the daughter of the mountains (the Himalayas), and manifests the aspect of the goddess as the wife of Shiva. She is generally considered a benign goddess. She is one of the principal deities of Shaktism and sometimes considered the essence of Shakti herself, i.e. Adi-shakti .arms, but when alone, she is shown having four arms, and riding a tiger or lion. She is also known by a number of other names, including Durga (Goddess Beyond reach)Ambika (mother), Gauri (golden), Shyama (dark complexioned), Bhavani (Mother of Universe) Bhairavi (awesome) and Kali (black-colored or Goddess of Time). She is also identified as Mahadevi.\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "title": "decoration with rajastani doll", "publishedDate": "2014-10-08T11:25:28.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OHQ-JXzNbQ", "description": "IRAQ WAR 2014 : Iraqi Forces Recapture 60 Villages  from IS\nIRAQ WAR 2014 : Iraqi Forces Recapture 60 Villages  from IS\nIRAQ WAR 2014 : Iraqi Forces Recapture 60 Villages  from IS\nIRAQ WAR 2014 : Iraqi Forces Recapture 60 Villages  from IS | COMBAT RAW http://youtu.be/8OHQ-JXzNbQ\n\niraq war 2014, iraq war isis, iraq war isis 2014, iraq war isis video, \n\niraq crisis 2014, iraq crisis today, iraq crisis latest, iraq crisis video, \n\niraq isis 2014, iraq isis war, iraq isis women's, iraq isis 2014 war, \n\nArabic Keyword :\n\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2014\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2014\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648\u060c \u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2014\u060c \u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u060c \u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u060c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0627\u0645 2014\u060c \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0633 2014 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u060c", "title": "IRAQ WAR 2014 : Iraqi Forces Recapture 60 Villages  from IS | COMBAT RAW", "publishedDate": "2014-10-04T02:03:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OHgEcxYjOs", "description": "www.rtp.pt/5meianoite \nhttps://www.facebook.com/5meianoite\nhttp://www.rtp.pt/play/p1046/5-meia-noite-iii", "title": "\"Mostra-me a tua lingerie!\" - Nilton - 5 Para a Meia Noite", "publishedDate": "2013-04-29T11:24:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OHnniH-1g0", "description": "CNN's Nina dos Santos looks at what currency options would be available to an independent Scotland.", "title": "What currency would Scotland use?", "publishedDate": "2014-09-15T11:33:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OI5dDp965U", "description": "Recorded in Sydney, Australia to a small but appreciative audience of tables and chairs.

Ready to learn Hindi? Here are three steps to get you started learning Hindi. You should start with these basics and learn them very well. http://www.PrimeHow.com/LearnHindi\nStep 1 - Learn Hindi Script\n\nBefore you start to learn Hindi, it is best to first learn the Hindi script, also called Devanagari. The Devanagari script is phonetic and easy to learn. Learn the Devanagari script first. Then learn grammar. This step should not be skipped.\nStep 2 - Learn Hindi Grammar\n\nWhen you have learned the Devanagari script and can read it, it is time to learn grammer by going through the free Hindi lessons. In each lesson, you will learn a few new vocabulary and a new grammatical point. Audio recordings of native Hindi-speakers are available in the beginning lessons. There will also be a few example sentences in both English and Hindi at the end of the lesson that utilize both the new vocabulary and the new grammar to help you learn quicker.\nStep 3 - Hindi Practice\n\nLearning to speak Hindi fluently will take more than just learning all the grammatical rules. You must practice what you have learned until it you can do it without effort. I will soon be adding helpful resources to help you learn Hindi faster. These will include Hindi stories with audio recordings, Hindi songs with lyrics, and more.", "title": "Learn Conversational Hindi Easily and Fast", "publishedDate": "2012-12-04T13:40:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OLaNFHO6Q8", "description": "- Music by Johnny Mandel; Lyrics by Paul Francis Webster\n\n- It was the Academy Award Winner for Best Song in 1965\n\n* You can find a lot of versions on the net but this one was the original from the motion picture.", "title": "\"The Shadow of Your Smile\" from The Sandpiper - Original Choral Version", "publishedDate": "2010-08-14T20:21:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OMGsVnqvyA", "description": "Happy Easter!\n\u25baSee more at http://distractify.com/\n\nSubscribe for more every day! \n\nHilarious Interview: http://youtu.be/qFHOq9NgyoY\n\nCheck out Fail Compilations: http://www.youtube.com/failarmy", "title": "The Power of True Kindness", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T22:00:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OMWaiZMqg0", "description": "The song \"Manannan Mac Lir\" by Marie Breatnach.

Si differenziano dalle \"cugine\" razze della famiglia rajidae per la presenza dell'aculeo velenoso sulla coda, il quale produce l'ittioacantossina e provoca effetti simili alla cancrena e al tetano. Gli esemplari pi\u00f9 grandi (appartenenti alla specie Himantura chaophraya) possono raggiungere 4,60 metri di lunghezza e 1,90 metri di larghezza.\nNegli esemplari di maggiori dimensioni, l'aculeo pu\u00f2 arrivare fino a 35-40 centimetri di lunghezza, ha un profilo dentellato ed \u00e8 rivestito da una guaina epiteliale. Alla radice dell'aculeo si trovano due ghiandole velenifere che secernono una sostanza composta dagli enzimi 5-nucleotidasi e fosfodiesterasi, che distruggono le cellule, e da serotonina, che provoca contrazioni muscolari. L'azione di tale cocktail \u00e8 necrotizzante e a questo si unisce la possibilit\u00e0 di infezioni batteriche anche gravi. A seconda della zona colpita dall'aculeo, il decorso pu\u00f2 arrivare ad essere mortale (si veda l'esempio del conduttore televisivo Steve Irwin, morto in Australia in seguito a un colpo ricevuto da un trigone il 4 settembre 2006). L'aculeo generalmente si spezza e rimane nella ferita: per l'animale non \u00e8 un grave danno, poich\u00e9 ricresce con una velocit\u00e0 di circa 1-1,5 centimetri al mese.", "title": "Trigone nelle acque del catanese", "publishedDate": "2013-08-20T17:45:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OMdQ22YfNc", "description": "Para el semestre Primavera 2014, la Toma de Ramos comienza el 15 de Julio.

None of the videos demonstrated concepts from a visual viewpoint.  For example, if a video was explaining how spanning-tree would use BPDUs to prevent routing loops, the instructor would pull up a terminal window and show BPDUs being send and received by Cisco switches, and leave it up to the viewer to imagine what was happening.  They might even display a few diagrams to give a general idea of what the networking topology looks like, but I still wanted more.  Since I am a more visually orientated person, I would prefer to see an animation of switches connect to each other and BPDU packets interacting between the switches.\n \nI created these series of free videos for people like me who want to visualize what is happening, and not just simply hear a description of the process.  Most people have to create network lab scenarios because the process is not clear to them.  I have done my best using Cisco Packet Tracer and PowerPoint Animation to give my viewers a better understanding of how server and networking systems work at the visual level.

Despite going 45 minutes without a pulse, she suffered no brain damage during the Sept. 23 ordeal.\n\n\"She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death,\" said Thomas Chakurda, the hospital spokesman.\n\nDoctors had called the family into the operating room and told them there was nothing more they could do for 40-year-old Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro.\n\nGraupera-Cassimiro gave birth to a healthy daughter before amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream and heart and created a vacuum, stopping circulation. Doctors say condition is often fatal.\n\nChakurda said the woman's survival is a story of two miracles - her resuscitation and the fact that she survived without serious brain damage.\n\nMedical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try and restore heart beat and circulation, Chakurda said.\n\n\"Today she is the picture of health,\" he said.\n\nDoctors had no immediate explanation for her survival, Chakurda said, calling her case one of \"divine providence.\"\n\nGraupera-Cassimiro did not return a phone message left by The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nGraupera-Cassimiro said when she awoke, she had no idea what had happened, but then remembered something from the time that she was unconscious.\n\n\"I remember feeling a force telling me you're not coming here, it's not your time,\" she said. \n\nHer gynecologist, Dr. Michael Fleischer, talked to Kimberly Guilfoyle on \"Fox and Friends\" this morning, saying the c-section was completely normal, but Graupera-Cassimiro stopped breathing while in recovery.\n\nA healthy baby girl, named Taily, had already been delivered.\n\nFleischer described the dramatic series of events that unfolded after doctors initially thought they could not save the woman. \n\nHe said family members came in and were praying while chest compressions were being performed on Graupera-Cassimiro.\n\nFleischer recalled a very emotional scene, with the family praying and Graupera-Cassimiro's mother saying \"please God, take me instead.\"\n\nA nurse then ran back out to tell the family that her heart was beating again after they had said their goodbyes.", "title": "Florida Mom Miraculously Survives 45 Minutes Without Pulse After C Section", "publishedDate": "2014-11-10T15:53:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ORqIxUCYJk", "description": "", "title": "Familial hypercholesterolemia", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T10:36:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OS7StPar_8", "description": "Download More Movie At www.jfoised.com\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar's first EVER TV movie, 'Blowhole Strikes Back' (also known from Comic Con as 'The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole')", "title": "Penguins Of Madagascar The Return Of The Revenge Of Dr Blowhole Movie Trailer", "publishedDate": "2012-01-17T18:15:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OSC7UV9U9s", "description": "In this 'Speaking From Experience' video clip, participants explore the range of emotions they experienced following heart surgery.

Humiliatingly pulled naked from bed, he was repeatedly terrorised with the threat that he was about to be killed if he did not fully comply and submit.\n\nThat victim of home invasion was Gordon Clark, a film director freshly returned from 26 years in Hollywood.\nSome investigation in the ensuing days revealed that his story was not at all news-worthy - not even to the local rag!  His tale was too mundane - every neighbour on all sides had been through similar.\nThe further he looked, the more-of-the-same he found - in every suburb across the country.\nTo air their plight and turn an urgent spotlight on the terror of it, Gordon resolved to give his neighbours the microphone to let them tell their story and put a human face on the bald statistics of home-invasion attacks that run with the monotonous repetitiveness of ticker-tape. \n\n#BehindParadiseTheMovie peels back the covers to illustrate what most of us don't realize about our own environment - be that environment another suburb or farm community - until we too become victims of ambush.\n\n\nThis documentary exposes reality in a single 'average' suburb of South Africa:\n - Every 3rd* night in just that small community, yet another family is assaulted; marauding gangs, sometimes military trained, burst in brandishing knives and guns\n   * 143 \"Robbery with aggravating circumstances\" in 2013 - as indicated by official police statistics at: \nhttp://www.crimestatssa.com/precinct.php?id=1081 - where the 'Robbery with aggravating circumstances\" category shows an unchecked rise from 2004, when 33 incidents occurred, until, 10 years later, a total of 813 individual victims or families in just this one suburb are now dealing with the terror of this dreadful experience.\n\nVictims are routinely threatened with murder, terrified to their core, and stripped of their valuables, dignity and sleep for years to come.\nTheir lives change forever.\nMost suburbs suffer similarly - there is nowhere to flee to.  Many emigrate.\n\nWatch the trailer, share this message, and, when voting days come around, send your politicians a powerful message - remind them: \"You are our servant - we pay the bills - protect us.\"\n\n___\n\nPLEASE VISIT our official sponsor at: www.voicealert.co.za\n\n----------\n\nOfficial Facebook and Twitter pages:\n\n- http://wwww.facebook.com/behindparadisethemovie\n\n- https://twitter.com/BehindParadise\n\nFeel free to stream or download the full 42-minute MP3 movie soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/stream", "title": "Behind Paradise - Suburb-after-Suburb Under Siege in South Africa", "publishedDate": "2014-03-23T19:44:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "8ObyPq-OmO0", "description": "Learn why Corning created tougher glass for rougher falls and find out how Corning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass 4 is Corning\u2019s toughest cover glass to date. \n\nLearn more at http://www.corninggorillaglass.com/.", "title": "Corning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass 4: Testing Video", "publishedDate": "2014-11-20T12:31:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "8Oc4En69dIo", "description": "YOU MUST WATCH THIS!

The last time he had stood the pulpit at his Saddleback Church, in Southern California, was on Easter, seventeen Sundays ago \u2014 and five days before his youngest son, Matthew, 27, shot and killed himself, ending a lifelong struggle with mental illness. On Saturday night, for the first time since their son's death, Rick and his wife Kay returned to their 20,000-member congregation. Together they faced the question tens of thousands of Christians have been asking: How are they \u2014 two of the world's most famous Christians \u2014 able to hope in God in the midst of their despair?\n\nThousands of parishioners packed the auditorium and three overflow tents on Saturday for the first of Saddleback's five-weekend worship services. A dozen local pastors all sat in the front row in a show of support for the Warrens, along with Roma Downey and Mark Burnett, producers of the hit television series, The Bible. When Rick and Kay walked hand in hand onstage, the crowd stood to their feet in appreciation and applause. Kay began to cry, and Rick kissed her on the forehead as he too grew teary. \"Love you too,\" he told the audience. He paused for just a few moments, and then he began to preach.\n\nFirst he thanked his staff, his church, and, the hundreds of people who have supported them over the past four months. Above all, he thanked the Warrens' other two children, Amy and Josh, who, he said, had loved Matthew and \"talked him off the ledge\" time and time again. \"They really are my heroes,\" he said, voice breaking.", "title": "RICK WARREN WAS HIS SON GAY?", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T10:38:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "8OhJiDBxEGI", "description": "Recipe here: http://www.japanesecooking101.com/sunomono-cucumber-salad-recipe/\nConnect with us on Facebook!  https://www.facebook.com/JapaneseCooking101\nSunomono (Cucumber Salad) is such an easy and  refreshing side dish.

In the child body people overestimated object sizes significantly more than in the adult body. Also they showed implicit attitudes more in accord with being a child than being an adult. Crucially this effect only occurred when they had a strong body ownership illusion with respect to the child body. When, in another experimental condition, this illusion was extinguished, the differences in perceptions and attitudes between the adult and child condition vanished. This suggests that our perceptual and attitudinal processing is influenced not just by the size but also by the shape of the body.
