But their song lives on, in the voices of Willie Nelson, Doc Watson, Leon Russell and Arlo Guthrie.\n\nAnd the Columbus Stockade still holds prisoners.\n\nThe servant\n\nIt might be the city's most dependable public servant, in one of the least desirable jobs.\n\nWhether the Columbus Stockade is the most famous local landmark is as open to question. Tell strangers you're from Columbus, Ga., and see if they know the name from the \"Columbus Stockade Blues,\" the song that locks the words \"Columbus\" and \"Georgia\" together like a jail door:\n\n\"Way down in Columbus, Georgia...\"\n\nWay down in the Columbus Stockade, friends for more than a century have turned their backs on freedom, sometimes for months, sometimes only weekends. The city's oldest jail over the years has been a place where the regulars got to know each other.\n\nToday the jail made famous by the song still holds people convicted of petty offenses and sentenced to short time, or to what we today call public service.\n\nIt serves essentially the same purpose as a century ago.\n\n\"City Chain Gang\" -- it's marked on a 1907 map, when the stockade complex still had two separate brick buildings, later to be joined by an extension stretching from the two-story eastern building next to Columbus Recorder's Court to the western building by the Muscogee County jail's parking lot. The western building, at 1 1/2 stories, long served as the stockade kitchen and dining hall. Today, it's used for storage.\n\nThe eastern side of the conjoined buildings at 622 10th St. now holds 10-15 prisoners during the week and about 20 more on weekends, when those sentenced to public service come in at 6 p.m. Friday and leave at 3:30 p.m. Sunday. The trusties go out daily on work details, cleaning public buildings and picking up trash -- just as inmates did decades ago.\n\n\"They can have anything from one weekend to 52 weekends,\" said Terri Ezell, the sheriff's commander in charge of the county jail. \"It's all men.\" The stockade will hold up to 110.\n\n\"For what it's being used for, it's serviceable for that,\" said retired Muscogee County Sheriff Gene Hodge. \"For low-security weekenders and this type of thing, it works very well.\"\n\nThe survivor\n\nThe Columbus Stockade has outlived two younger jails, once served as the city's police headquarters and more recently as a fallback when the county jail got overcrowded.\n\nThe city reopened and renovated it to relieve overcrowding in 1981. Hodge was the sheriff then.\n\nHe was under a court order to alleviate the crush of prisoners then crowding a county jail built in 1939. City leaders decided to spend $25,000 bringing the old stockade up to code to hold inmates until a new jail opened.", "title": "Columbus Stockade Blues", "publishedDate": "2007-12-24T00:10:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4pgWD-PxYXc", "description": "Mr Jewell explains how to structure an English literature / critical essay.", "title": "How to structure an English Literature Essay", "publishedDate": "2011-03-28T14:12:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4ph6goprcz8", "description": "Music video by Indochine performing Un Singe En Hiver.

Then there are certain tips that can make this process more efficient. Let's talk about some of these tips that you should know!\n\n*Take advantage of CAIPS.\nCAIPS is short for 'Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System'. It is used by Citizenship & Immigration Canada to process visa applications. It holds all the information on the current status of every immigration application being processed by overseas offices.\n\nIf you have applied to emigrate to Canada with a PR visa then CAIPS allows you to obtain a copy of your immigration file and find out what is the status of your application.\n\n* Use the Wizard!\nUse the Come to Canada Wizard to see if you meet the minimum requirements for immigration. You will need about 15 minutes to complete the questionnaire. You may be asked questions about your: nationality, age, language ability, family members, education, work experience, income and net worth.\n\nYou will get a list of specific application steps for each program. These steps include links to the proper forms and information:\nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/ctc-vac/cometocanada.asp\n\nPaid immigration representatives\nOnly certain lawyers, paralegals, notaries and immigration consultants can provide paid services in connection with a Canadian immigration proceeding or application. You can find out more about them in the description of our video.\n\nMore tips and trivia at FacXtract.

Celebrimbor, the greatest Elven-smith of the Second Age, was lord of Eregion when fair-faced Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, claimed he could take their talents to the next level.\n\nWith his teachings, the Gwaith forged the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor also created Three Rings untouched by Annatar, who was really Sauron all along. Using Gwaith knowledge, Sauron forged the One Ring within the heart of Mt. Doom to control the other rings and their bearers. The Elves hid the other rings, but Sauron captured and tortured Celebrimbor for their whereabouts. Celebrimbor kept the Three Rings hidden, but died before the Elves were able to defeat Sauron through their alliance with men.\n\nThousands of years later, on the night Sauron returned to Mordor, Talion, a Captain and Ranger of Gondor, was stationed at the Black Gate. After he, his wife Ioreth, son Dirhael, and everyone he knows is murdered, Talion finds himself resurrected and sharing his body with a wraith, or apparition. Now you must use your combined powers to recover the wraith\u2019s memories, exact revenge on the Black Hand, and break the curse to reunite with your family in the afterlife.\n\nHave fun!\n\n---------\nThe Daily Byte: http://bit.ly/1qhR5bD\nLore! http://bit.ly/nNfsws\nWho is Polaris? http://bit.ly/14Z6vUP\n\n---------\nJOIN POLARIS: http://bit.ly/17MTzDW\nPOLARISGO: http://bit.ly/1ec7Hu6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/12ecJOw\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/12Ue00n\nGoogle+: http://bit.ly/16l2toB\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/1aiOYgZ\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/13HgrW4\nMusic courtesy of Epidemic Sound and Audio Micro\n\n---------\nThanks for watching Lore!", "title": "LORE - Middle-earth: Shadows of Mordor Lore in a minute!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T01:13:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q5JwbRjyAI", "description": "\u8aac\u660e", "title": "Metasequoia", "publishedDate": "2014-05-19T11:57:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q5OfDPGou8", "description": "Recorded in Valongo, Portugal\nDate: 11/2011", "title": "Small cave with Trichomanes speciosum", "publishedDate": "2011-12-01T20:26:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q6cz69z6t4", "description": "Video casero de un Carancho adulto -Polyborus plancus- atendiendo al menos dos pichones, uno notablemente mayor que el otro.", "title": "Nido de Caranchos", "publishedDate": "2008-08-14T23:21:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q6yO5sAgo0", "description": "Sir.25\n[8] Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:", "title": "THIS IS OUR OPPRESSOR- WHAT A SHAME AND REPROACH", "publishedDate": "2014-04-14T16:59:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q71nEcPvuo", "description": "Gozzi - Balestra, USA | 2014 PD World Standard R2 SF\n\nWorld DanceSport Federation\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/J1Q1Wy\n\nDavide Gozzi - Claudia Balestra, USA, dance the second round Slow Foxtrot at the 2014 WDSF PD World Standard in Nanjing, CHN on 1 November.\n\n\nFACEBOOK: wdsfisdancesporttotal \nTWITTER: @dancesporttotal \nINSTAGRAM: #wdsfdancesport\nGOOGLE +: World DanceSport Federation\nwww.worlddancesport.org", "title": "Gozzi - Balestra, USA | 2014 PD World Standard R2 SF | DanceSport Total", "publishedDate": "2014-11-01T23:53:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "4q7Qz2L95CQ", "description": "Sign up for the Bulletproof Diet book list, and receive a free preview of the 1st chapter of the Bulletproof Diet Book as soon as it's ready!  http://bulletproofdietbook.com/\n\n\"Whole Grain\" food products are being touted as a health food that you need to incorporate into your diet. Are they really that healthy for you though? Grains that haven't been processed still contain the protective outer layer of the grain, which contains naturally occurring defense pesticides and anti-nutrients that are designed to cause inflammation and prevent animals (including humans) from eating the grains to ensure that they survive to become a plant. Seed and vegetable oils are another common source of the inflammation and food cravings that you'll experience when you eat whole grains, and these energy-sapping foods are all contributing the rising rates of degenerative diseases we see today. This is why whole grains and seed oils are not recommended on the Bulletproof Diet. Avoiding grains and processed oils will help you avoid inflammation and perform at your best! \n\nClick here to download the Bulletproof Diet Infographic to see which foods are recommended and which you should avoid in order to achieve the highest state of performance! http://bulletproofdietbook.com/\n\nCheck out these video for more info on:\nWhy You Should Avoid Gluten - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnpkYl3MM4\nWhen to Eat Your Carbs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEf453zxFe4\nEliminating Sugar Addiction & Food Cravings - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDcfB9HcQxY\n\nBulletproof Executive Radio is one of the top ranked Podcasts in Fitness and Nutrition on iTunes!

It's about Crytek being an R&D team for our game licensees; providing the latest, greatest technology we can, all the time. As an industry, we're all looking to deliver games as a service now -- and we feel the same approach can be taken with game engines. Today's announcement reflects this progress, as well as our ongoing commitment to making sure CRYENGINE\u00ae licensees always stay well ahead of the game.\"\n\nAlso commenting on Crytek's announcement, Carl Jones, Business Development Director at Crytek, said: \"Since CryENGINE 3 was launched in 2009, we've dramatically changed the engine so many times, with so many major new features, it's not the same engine anymore. We have revolutionised many parts of the engine: we have overhauled our entire lighting system, built movie quality character rendering and animation solutions, vastly improved the speed and effectiveness of our Sandbox editor, and even our rendering has changed with tessellation, pixel accurate displacement mapping and now physical based rendering; all of this while maintaining our first principal: that making games should be real-time, all the time. CRYENGINE is a new engine from Crytek -- and it always will be!\"\n\nThis week also sees a major update to Crytek's free CRYENGINE\u00ae SDK; granting non-commercial users access to a raft of the new features that recently helped to make Crysis 3 a visual benchmark for gaming. It is two years since the launch of the free CRYENGINE\u00ae SDK. In that time, the engine has been downloaded over five million times and is used for non-commercial projects every day by a constantly growing community and more than 400 universities. The update to the free SDK will take user feedback on board and remove some restrictions, which prevented users from working offline.\n\nThese changes to the CRYENGINE service are being marked with a new website which can be seen at www.cryengine.com. Over time, the site will grow to offer new options for game developers, and will ultimately become the central hub for all official CRYENGINE content online.", "title": "CryEngine Next Gen (PS4/Xbox One) Tech Demo [1080p] TRUE-HD QUALITY", "publishedDate": "2013-08-21T21:11:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qGS8AfSpZE", "description": "Warning and Disclaimer:\nAlthough every effort has been made to make this video as complete and accurate as possible,I have neither liability nor responsibility for any loss or damage arising from information contained in this video or from informational errors or omissions.\nIf you agree you may continue\nwatching these videos.", "title": "Homemade Bearing Puller", "publishedDate": "2010-01-16T06:38:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qGo4BvPMCw", "description": "Here is my Cab Driver Cover By The Hi-Marks.

In \"dry\" macular degeneration, deposits collect underneath the retina. In \"wet\" macular degeneration, abnormal blood vessels begin to sprout. A molecule known as a vascular endothelial growth factor, or \"VEGF\", is released in \"wet\" macular degeneration. VEGF binds to its receptors much like a key entering a lock. VEGF is a signal which causes leaky blood vessels to form underneath the retina. As these abnormal blood vessels leak and bleed, the retina becomes swollen and vision may decline.\n\nThe main treatment for \"wet\" macular degeneration is an injection of medication into the eye. This medication is delivered close to the retina after freezing and cleaning the eye, and most patients experience only minimal discomfort. These medications work by binding to the VEGF that is released, much like a sponge. As a result, the VEGF cannot bind to its receptors. These injections slow or stop the growth of abnormal vessels. As with any medical procedure, injections of anti-VEGF may help to preserve or slow the risk of vision loss from \"wet\" macular degeneration. Injections carry risks each time they are performed. They last only a certain time, and repeated injections may be necessary to preserve vision.

Las im\u00e1genes son de los alrededores del pueblo de Avebury en el sur de Inglaterra, con su famoso c\u00edrculo de piedras.\n\nHere are the words of the four verses I sing:\n\nYou combers all, both great and small, come listen to my ditty,\nFor I am he, and only he, regardless of your pity,\nFor I can write, read, drink and fight, and that is all my honour.\nMy failing's here, I love strong beer. I am a rambling comber.\n\nA dozen of wool through combs I pull all in the neatest manner.\nSo sleek and fine, like silk shall shine, all to my master's order.\nAnd when I'm done, it's off I run and take it to the owner.\nI make no doubt but that he will count. I am a rambling comber.\n\nThen on the tramp you'll see me scamp -- my shoes are in bad order.\nMy stockings down unto the ground, I seldom wear a garter,\nMy coat is scarcely worth a groat, and I have got no other,\nBecause, my dear, I love strong beer. I am a rambling comber.\n\nA pitcher I now will employ while I have cash or credit.\nI'll rant and roar, chalk on a score and pay them when I have it.\nFor beer is always in my mind, let me be drunk or sober.\nA pretty girl is my delight and a glass of good October.", "title": "The Rambling Comber with lyrics (Nick Skelton)", "publishedDate": "2012-04-04T22:16:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qMe7nvj-JY", "description": "We was at a step show and Malcom of XEB in a competition for cane masters", "title": "C.E.B-X.E.B Malcom in the Cane Master thing", "publishedDate": "2012-02-02T00:05:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qMnUq28Pms", "description": "Tyga : bouncing on my dick. #BitchImTheShit.

He was a United States Senator from Delaware from January 3, 1973 until his resignation on January 15, 2009, following his election to the Vice Presidency.\n\nBiden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and lived there for ten years before moving to Delaware. He became an attorney in 1969, and was elected to a county council in 1970. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history. He was re-elected to the Senate six times, was the fourth most senior senator at the time of his resignation, and is the 14th-longest serving Senator in history. Biden was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. His strong advocacy helped bring about U.S. military assistance and intervention during the Bosnian War. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991. He voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002, but later proposed resolutions to alter U.S. strategy there. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.\n\nBiden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, both times dropping out early in the race. Barack Obama selected Biden to be the Democratic Party nominee for Vice President in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Biden is the first Roman Catholic and the first Delawarean to become Vice President of the United States. As Vice President, Biden has been heavily involved in Obama's decision-making process and has held the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package aimed at counteracting the late-2000s recession.", "title": "Kanevil B.

An adventure, 100 million years in the making.\n\nSYNOPSIS\nThis documentary takes us into the extraordinary world of 3 of Australia's most prolific outback fossil hunters - the legendary Dinosaur Dick Suter (Boulia, Qld) and gifted husband and wife team, Tom and Sharon Hurley (Andamooka, SA). Call them fossil collectors or amateur dinosaur hunters or fossil whisperers, they are the modern day Indiana Jones's of the Australian outback. Their obsession with fossils leads Tom and Sharon half way across the country to the dinosaur fields of outback Queensland, near the small community of Boulia, where they team up with Dinosaur Dick, curator of the acclaimed Boulia Marine Reptile Fossil Museum. Set in the most astonishing Queensland and South Australian outback environments, the series documents their adventures and awesome 100 million year old outback sea monster discoveries. On their journey they share their stories, secrets, knowledge and lifelong fascination with fossils and the Australian outback. \n\nSERIES CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION\n4 x TV half hour series and 1 x TV hour - Adventure Documentary \n\nCONTACT\nDirector/Co-Producer:  Kim Mavromatis (MAV Media) www.mavmedia.com.au\nEMAIL: mav@mavmedia.com.au\n\nCo-Producer: Carlos Alperin (Galloping Films) www.gallopingfilms.com \nEMAIL: carlos@gallopingfilms.com\n\nCENTRAL CHARACTERS\nTom and Sharon Hurley\nDinosaur Dick Suter\n\nANIMATION\nFroling Enterprises, Lead Artist Stuart Nankivell  (www.froling.com.au)", "title": "Foot Soldiers of Palaeontology (teaser 1)", "publishedDate": "2010-12-03T10:49:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qTY6-xKHpM", "description": "Bengali, Bengali\nBengali, Bengali\nNo no no\nHe does not want to depress you\nOh no no no no no\nHe only wants to impress you\n\nBengali in platforms\nHe only wants to embrace your culture\nAnd to be your friend forever\nForever\n\nBengali, Bengali\nBengali, Bengali\nOh, shelve your Western plans\nAnd understand\nThat life is hard enough when you belong here\n\nA silver-studded rim that glistens\nAnd an ankle-star that.. blinds me\nA lemon sole so very high\nWhich only reminds me to tell you\n\"Break the news gently\nBreak the news to him gently\"\nShelve your plans, shelve your plans, shelve them\n\nBengali, Bengali\nIt's the touchy march of time that binds you\nDon't blame me\nDon't hate me\nJust because I'm the one to tell you\nThat life is hard enough when you belong here\nThat life is hard enough when you belong here\n\nShelve your Western plans\nShelve your Western plans\n'Cause life is hard enough when you belong\nLife is hard enough when you belong here\n\nShelve your Western plans\n'Cause life is hard when you belong here\nLife is hard enough when you belong", "title": "Morrissey - Bengali in platforms", "publishedDate": "2010-07-22T05:54:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qTx8N42G0s", "description": "Extra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo de Linha\u00e7a dourada em equipamento ERT 75 II, com capacidade de 100 kg/h, \u00e0 frio.", "title": "Scott Tech - Extra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00d3leo de Linha\u00e7a Dourada - ERT 75 II", "publishedDate": "2013-04-23T16:52:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qTx9M37eXA", "description": "Semen Padang Vs Persela Lamongan (4-2) ISL 8 Besar 2014\nSemen Padang Vs Persela Lamongan (4-2) ISL 8 Besar 2014\n\nLangganan di Channel Kami Dengan Kliki Tautan https://www.youtube.com/user/galeribolaindonesia?sub_confirmation=1", "title": "Semen Padang Vs Persela Lamongan (4-2) ISL 8 Besar 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-10-13T03:24:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qU6RmVFyo8", "description": "Trocando Ip no Win 7/Vista em 2 minutos", "title": "Trocando Ip no Win 7/Vista em 2 minutos", "publishedDate": "2010-07-25T03:19:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "4qU9Pzzzk3Q", "description": "This Spinach and Artichoke Dip is incredibly easy.

These little guys come from Mexico for the most part, as do a lot of their cousins: red knees, red legs, an awful lot of red painted tarantulas. This guy's red focuses right back here in his rump. Is that his rump? No of course not, that's his abdomen. All arachnids are really a two-parted animal, head and thorax fuse together and the abdomen on the bottom. But it is covered in red hair. Like most of his North American cousins, these guys are quick to flick. We have to be very careful around them. This guy was just doing it. Whoops! He's going to do it if I jostle him for sure. They take their hind leg and they rub it really fast and hairs go into the air and they're extremely irritating, so we don't want to mess with that. \n\nBut these guys are very popular in the pet world because they are very simple to keep, a very simple animal to keep in a little tiny 10-gallon tank. You can put a lot of plants in there. You can put little hide spots around. And all tarantulas are very, very easy to keep because their diet (oh, here comes another tarantula), their diet is one that they don't eat a lot. So they're very easy to take care of in captivity. \n\nThe Mayans, this little guy grew in an area where the Mayans lived. The Mayans used these for all kinds of medicinal purposes. The Mayans would crush up their exoskeletons after they died and use them for a variety of potions for various illnesses they may have had. But in the new world, they're just in the pet world. The red rump tarantulas are readily available these days. I have them on a stand here just to accentuate his beautiful colors, but the proper substrate for him would be more of a peat moss type mixture, not the sand and the dried out one you see in front of you.

The endless options of EDM have ever been the object of \u00d8rjan Nilsen's affection. Thrilled by diversity, he has spend months of time in the studio, trying to find the perfect blend of house, trance, progressive and everything else that tingles his open mind. The result, an amalgam of years of creativity, is \u00d8rjan's promising debut album, 'In My Opinion'.\n\nIndulged with music from an early age, he mastered the drums and keyboard at only 9 years old. At the age of 16, as he experienced his first crush on trance music and completely fell in love with rhythmic patterns and melodies, he got his first synthesizer. The Norwegian music lover, reigning from the cold, upper part of the country, soon learned about the magic of working on a pc and started experimenting with that extraordinary grey box. After some unofficial remixes and solo tracks, it was the release of 'Red Woods' in 2005 that turned out to be \u00d8rjan's breakthrough. Ever since, no dancefloor is safe to the sounds of the characteristic Norwegian. Summer-hit 'La Guitarra', hammered by the trance elite for months in a row, the rough 'Moving Mojave' and sensitive 'Lovers Lane', keeping up with the ever-throbbing heart of the club society, contagious 'So Long Radio', 'Mjuzik' and the strong and outstanding 'Go Fast!'. All original and different, yet distinctively riding the Nilsen sound.\n\nAfter months of hard work in the studio, \u00d8rjan Nilsen proudly presents 'In My Opinion'. Days of experimenting, blending and shaping now come together in an album that is, sounds and represents \u00d8rjan. \u00d8rjan:\"I can't describe it other than being me. The sound you're hearing is me, and how I feel and think. It seems like I have so many things that need to get to the surface, and I'm showing that through my music.\"\n\n15 jewels of tracks tell the colorful story of musical talent, touching you on the inside with a palette of melody, beats, synths and a whole lot of feeling to glue it together. Whether you're in the mood to party or simply feel like absorbing the album with the volume up at home, 'In My Opinion' will fit all sceneries. Free of parochialism and one-style-fits-all, but crossing boundaries and hitting the right spot at the right time, is what 'In My Opinion' is all about. \u00d8rjan:\"I just didn't follow any kind of recipe. I've merged so many styles together, made so many new things and I hope it reflects both the past and future, as well as the present.\"\n\n1 The Thunder (feat.

Since MS incorporates a high potion (60% of phys converted to fire) of elemental damage (and projectiles), i opted to roll a new build, this ele/phys tank templar. (Skill tree link below)\n\nCurrent supports used with MS:\n- Multistrike\n- Faster Attacks\n- Weapon Elemental Damage\n- Melee Physical Damage (swapped with Added Fire Damage or sth)\n\nMolten Strike mechanics: http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Molten_Strike\n\nAs opposed to the fact that the support gem \"Melee Physical Damage\" does not directly increase the damage of the projectiles MS launches on attack/swing, it does overall increase the damage of the projectiles, since it is derived from the damage of the melee potion of the attack. \nI tested several combinations (added fire, increased elemental with weapons, concentrated effect, point blank,...) and this combination turned out to work best for the used weapon (phys dmg claw, which gives life on hit which works good with those projectiles, because each projectile gives life on hit) - but i try to get a decent high dps crit dagger, so the support gem combination used will change.\n\nNotable skill tree nodes:\n- Iron Grip (applies strength bonus to projectiles), currently the overal strength is at 426, per 5 str you gain 1% damage: 85,2% increased projectile damage :D\n- I picked one endurence charge and took the one of Oak Merciless too to have some fun with my Q20 Immortal Call gem\n\nSome math on the projectiles and Iron Grip:\n\nImagine 1000 pdps (1000 phys damage, 1 second attack speed), MS converts 60% of phys damage to fire damage: \n 600 fire, 400 phys, \n\nProjectiles deal 40% less damage:\n1000 x 0,6 = 600\n    -or- (equivalent)\n600 x 0,6 + 400 x 0,6 == 360 + 240 = 600\n\nIron Grip 85,2% damage bonus: 600 x 1,852 = 1111,2. Per projectile. Which may hit a single mob :D\n\nI am leveling a Q17 Point Blank (PB) which i will swap in as soon as the attack speed penalty is tolerable for me. PB gives up to 50% increased projectile damage on near targets, which is perfect for this skill.\n\nCurrent skill tree:\nhttps://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgUAAdwCcQSzBS0FWwthFE0YXRo4G_ojTSSLJd8nLy3SMfsyCTJ-Mok26DpSOtg8LT0PQDZBh0RyRtdHflPfV-JYr1jbXcZfP2BLZU1nm2xGbmlybHTtd-N35XgNeWh673y7fVN99X_jhMSE2YTvi4yQVZtYm4OiAKQZp4SpbqvFrj60-baGtz6-ir6nwA_BBMQVxLjE9sau0k3V-N3z4XPjn-RR7DjtIO8O8B_zcfno", "title": "Path of Exile: Molten Strike Iron Grip Templar on Docks Merciless", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T14:32:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "4r4LL_1lJKU", "description": "Family Guy - S10E09\n\n\"Sorry dude.

Nach dieser sollten die Eigenschaften von Heilpflanzen an ihrem Aussehen oder ihrer Farbe erkennbar sein. So glaubte die Menschen damals, mit den harten, wei\u00dfen, fast porzellanartig aussehenden N\u00fcsschen des Steinsamens Steinleiden erfolgreich behandeln zu k\u00f6nnen. Erfahrungen und Untersuchungen der modernen Medizin haben jedoch keinen Beweis f\u00fcr diese dem Echten Steinsamen zugeschriebenen Eigenschaften belegen k\u00f6nnen. Ein Absud der Pflanze scheint jedoch eine harntreibende Wirkung zu haben. Auch wurde eine verwandte Art des Steinsamen, der Lithospermum ruderale, fr\u00fcher von den Indianern als Mittel zur Empf\u00e4ngnisverh\u00fctung verwendet. Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen konnten beweisen, dass diese Art wie auch der Echte Steinsame medizinisch wirksame Stoffe enthalten, die von der Hypophyse, der Hirnanhangdr\u00fcse, produzierte Hormone unwirksam machen k\u00f6nnen. Bei Laborversuchen mit Ratten wurde auch festgestellt, dass bei Verabreichung von Steinsamenextrakt nach einigen Tagen der normale Zyklus von Eierstock und Geb\u00e4rmutter stockte und erst f\u00fcnf bis acht Tage nach Einstellen der Behandlung wieder einsetzte.\n\nJe nach Standort wird der einj\u00e4hrige Steinsame 40 bis 80 cm hoch. Die aufrechten, kr\u00e4ftigen und verzweigten St\u00e4ngel der Pflanze sind behaart.

Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images\u2014a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[5] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[6][7] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.", "title": "A Glimpse by Walt Whitman", "publishedDate": "2014-02-15T21:54:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rPMIkN5fR4", "description": "Amazing Up Close Footage of Popcorn Popping in Super Slow Motion\nWatch Previous Video:  http://youtu.be/COqSrOaob2Q?list=PLaJvC5R-EeuuerfWfd4ANqzPo1OuU9EqR\nLike Us On Facebook: www.facebook.com/slowmotionlab\n\nWatch More (videos at the end): \nMad Tile Ninja!!! - in super slow motion | Slow Mo Lab \nhttp://youtu.be/keezieObgzc?list=PLaJvC5R-EeuuerfWfd4ANqzPo1OuU9EqR\n\nBizarre Balloon Burst at 60,000fps - Slow Mo | Slow Mo Lab:\nhttp://youtu.be/E_Xe486i-Q0?list=PLaJvC5R-EeuuerfWfd4ANqzPo1OuU9EqR\n\nIn this episode, Taras and Dima film a cool and amazing video (incredible science experiment) of a pop corn kernel popping in super slow motion.

Alternative approaches to treating the Epstein Barr Virus, including the seven mistakes people can make when recovering. Video by natural therapist Elizabeth Noble. Mistake 1 - Not resting your body Firstly the most common mistake people make is not resting when they are first diagnosed with Epstein Barr. Most people feel pretty bad when they are diagnosed. Symptoms can include extreme fatigue, sore throat, swollen glands, muscle aches, headaches, nausea and sometimes fever. Despite these debilitating symptoms some people try and struggle on and keep going to work, school or college, running a household, rushing around after their family. Mistake 2 - Not getting adequate sleep Your body specifically needs good quality sleep when recovering from Epstein Barr.It is during sleep that your body produces a hormone called growth hormone. Growth hormone is your body's repair hormone. Now going to bed too late, this is after about 11 p.m. your body produces less growth hormone. So please make sure you are in bed and asleep by 11 p.m. Get into a routine of unwinding before bed. Having a relaxing bath, reading quietly in bed, meditating or enjoying a chamomile tea before bed are all good ideas you can try. Mistake 3 - Lack of adequate water Now the third mistake, and this is probably the most common mistake I see in my patients, is not drinking enough water to flush out the viruses and toxins from your system. I realize that in some people the throat can get really sore and inflamed which makes it hard to swallow. In these cases a hot lemon and honey tea can help soothe the throat and make drinking easier. Alternatively sucking on ice cubes can numb the pain and get the fluids into your body.", "title": "Natural treatments mononucleosis & Epstein Barr", "publishedDate": "2008-06-17T13:33:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rR3jLhgz58", "description": "How to fold a crown with your napkin.

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people.\n\n\"forrest gump\",\"forrest gump clip\",\"forrest gump soundtrack\",\"forrest gump part 1\",\"tom hanks\",\"mykelti williamson\",\"afemo omilami\",\"robert zemeckis\",\"boot videos\",\"rifle videos\",\"toothbrush videos\",\"romantic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",blockbusters,drama,\"dramas based on the book\",\"period pieces\",tearjerkers,\"steve starkey\",\"charles newirth\",\"steve tisch\",\"wendy finerman\",\"friendship videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++131221,/m/0bxtg,/m/0gg7plr,/m/04nzy1", "title": "Bubba on Shrimp - Forrest Gump (3/9) Movie CLIP (1994) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-07T01:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rTAWmyUNs8", "description": "Got my Conch done :) Wasn't as bad as expected!

The initial DS version, released on December 18, 2008 in Japan, was made available in two versions, one with anime-style video scenes, and the other having Pixar-like 3D video scenes. While the video's featured different art styles, the two versions maintained the same story and gameplay. On March 7, 2013, a third version, a remake titled Tales of Hearts R, was released on the PlayStation Vita. In early 2014, it was announced that the Vita version would have an English language release in North America and Europe between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015.\nTales of Hearts follows a similar gameplay structure to other titles in the series. The player visits various towns in which they can talk to various non-playable characters, buy items, and progress the story. \nRecovery Stones replaces the common cooking system of the series. The recovery stone can be set to be used at various times during battle to recover HP, or for other effects. When the stone is used it consumes \"Heal Energy\", which can be recharged at a recovery stone shop, or in dungeons. At the shops the player can also pay to increase the number of effects that can be set to the stone, increase the amount of heal energy, or buy more effects that the recovery stone can use.\nBy going to accessory shops, the player can make different accessories through materials found throughout the game, all with different effects or benefits. Accessories can also be turned back into the materials used to create it for other uses.\nCustomization in the game is handled through the \"Soma Build\" system, through which the player upgrades the Soma (weapons) of the party and control their growth. The player can use raw materials found throughout the game to learn various abilities, or \"Soma Skills\" (of which there are four types: Parameter, Battle, Action, and Support), or to add various stat bonuses to a character.\nWhen Soma Build is performed on a weapon enough times, the weapon can go through a process called \"Soma Evolve\", in which the Soma will take on a new form and name, and unlock new Soma Skills and stat bonuses.\nThroughout the game there are various events in which the player can choose different options towards another character, called a \"Soma Link\". Through certain choices it will cause the outcomes of scenes to change, and the character may gain points towards their \"Soma Link Value\". Once it becomes high enough, the character can learn various skills.\nBy using Soma, the party can go into one's heart, called a \"Spir Link\". The person's mind is like a labyrinth, called a \"Spir Maze\", a place with various rare items and other things to find. There are chances to go into these during both the main scenario and with NPCs throughout the game.\nZerom, monsters that eat individuals 'Spiria' (or 'hearts'), have spread around the world. Therefore weapons called 'Somas', were created in order to banish all Zerom. People who possess Somas manage to enter someone's Spir-Maze or Heart Maze. Amber Hearts, who happens to be the vessel for Richea Spodune, was in search of a Soma together with her brother, Jadeite Hearts. Along the way an enemy, Incarose assaults them, but they manage to escape to the sea. They are brought into a little village of Seeble, where they meet the protagonist, Shing Meteoryte. There Shing took care of both of them and introduced them to the Soma they are looking for.\n\nDuring that time, Incarose makes an appearance once more; this time she manages to attack Amber and Shing's grandfather, Zeks. Since Shing has a Soma he intends to go within Amber's Spir Maze in order to cure her. But, the plan does not go well and Amber's Spiria ends up shattered into pieces and placed everywhere around the world. From there Shing's adventure of recovering Amber's Spiria shards begins. During that time Shing befriends several others and together has to overcome many obstacles and antagonists who are also looking for Spiria. During his travels, Shing discovers more and more about the world, Richea, Spiria, Zerom, etc.\nEventually, it is revealed that Creed Graphite, the ruler of Quartzia, was hidden away within Shing and is eventually drawn out by Incarose. The ancient defense system, Gardenia, is revived, though Creed is shocked at its nature. With the aid of Calcedony and his Spiria, Shing and the party are able to infiltrate Gardenia and defeat Creed, but through sacrifice. As a result, Gardenia is destroyed, and Creed and Flora are killed in the process.", "title": "Warmly Hometown - Tales of Hearts R Soundtrack", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T18:52:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rVnHArHv3s", "description": "The Betrayed People Who deny that our Holy Prophet Sal Allah o Alaih e Waa Aali Hee Wasalam is not Noor(Naoz o Billah) should ponder what they say....", "title": "NOOR coming out from Jaali Mubarak Madinah Sharif", "publishedDate": "2009-12-04T08:52:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rW17es_fAo", "description": "KBCB 2014", "title": "JINGHPAW WUNPAWNG HKALUP HPUNG 17 8 2014 BKK THAI", "publishedDate": "2014-08-17T16:25:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rW5a9-dNRU", "description": "Le T-34: Le Fer de lance de l'arm\u00e9e rouge sur http://www.imineo.com/documentaires/histoire/conflits-forces-speciales/t-34-maitre-steppes-video-7580.htm\n\nLe T-34, con\u00e7u, fabriqu\u00e9 et utilis\u00e9 en Russie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le vainqueur de la comp\u00e9tition meurtri\u00e8re entre l'arm\u00e9e allemande et l'arm\u00e9e sovi\u00e9tique.

Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.   \n\n\"clint eastwood\" \"christopher walken\" \"the jersey boys\" \"jersey boys\" \"jersey boys movie\" musical song music \"four seasons\" soundtrack dance biography \"Barry Livingston\" \"vincent piazza\" \"freya tingley\" \"francesca eastwood\" \"steve schirripa\" \"mike doyle\" \"james madio\" \"Tommy Devito\" \"John Lloyd Young\" \"frankie valli\" broadway \"jersey boys clip\" clip scene \"who loves you\" vchan", "title": "Jersey Boys Movie CLIP - Who Loves You (2014) - Christopher Walken Musical HD", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T14:59:50.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rcK2LBIoDk", "description": "Una fisura anal que dura menos de seis semanas se llama una fisura anal aguda. Una fisura anal cr\u00f3nica presenta s\u00edntomas durante m\u00e1s de seis semanas. Una fisura anal primaria no tiene una causa identificable, mientras que una fisura anal secundaria tiene una causa identificable.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los signos y s\u00edntomas de una fisura anal o fisura en el no?\n\nEl paciente siente y describe un s\u00edntoma, mientras que otras personas, entre ellas el m\u00e9dico o la enfermera detectan una se\u00f1al. Por ejemplo, el dolor de cabeza puede ser un s\u00edntoma, mientras que las pupilas dilatadas pueden ser un signo. Los principales signos y s\u00edntomas de una fisura anal incluyen:\n\nDolor - especialmente cuando se va al ba\u00f1o (defecar). Al sentarse el dolor es agudo, y luego puede haber una sensaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda de ardor. El miedo al dolor puede hacer que algunos pacientes no quieran ir al ba\u00f1o, lo que aumenta el riesgo de tener estre\u00f1imiento.\n\nDesafortunadamente, despu\u00e9s de retrasar el ir al ba\u00f1o, cuando la persona vaya es probable que sienta m\u00e1s dolor y lagrimeo debido a que las heces ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles y m\u00e1s grandes. Algunas personas pueden experimentar un dolor agudo cuando se limpian con papel higi\u00e9nico.\n\nRemedios caseros y naturales para la fisura anal o fisura en el ano\n\nSangre - como la sangre es fresca, ser\u00e1 de color rojo brillante y se puede notar en las heces o en el papel higi\u00e9nico. Las fisuras anales en los beb\u00e9s normalmente sangran. Los ni\u00f1os pueden estar alarmados ante la visi\u00f3n de la sangre de color rojo brillante en las heces o el papel higi\u00e9nico.\n\nComez\u00f3n - en la zona anal. La sensaci\u00f3n puede ser intermitente o persistente.\n\nDisuria - molestias al orinar (menos com\u00fan). Algunos pacientes pueden orinar con m\u00e1s frecuencia.\n\nPus - un mal olor (mal olor) descarga de pus puede provenir de la fisura anal.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son las causas de la fisura anal o fisura en el ano?\n\nEstre\u00f1imiento - las heces grandes y duras tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de causar lesiones en el \u00e1rea anal durante la defecaci\u00f3n que las m\u00e1s blandas y m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as.\n\nLos espasmos musculares - los expertos creen que los espasmos musculares del esf\u00ednter anal pueden aumentar el riesgo de desarrollar una fisura anal. Un espasmo es un breve movimiento muscular de sacudida, autom\u00e1tica, cuando el m\u00fasculo de repente puede apretar. Los espasmos musculares tambi\u00e9n pueden socavar el proceso de curaci\u00f3n.\n\nEmbarazo y parto - las mujeres embarazadas tienen un mayor riesgo de desarrollar una fisura anal hacia el final de su embarazo. La pared del ano tambi\u00e9n puede desgarrarse durante el parto.\n\nITS (infecciones de transmisi\u00f3n sexual) - tambi\u00e9n conocido como ETS (enfermedades de transmisi\u00f3n sexual) se relacionan con un mayor riesgo de tener fisuras anales. Los ejemplos incluyen la s\u00edfilis, VPH (virus del papiloma humano), el herpes y la clamidia.\n\nRemedios caseros y naturales para la fisura anal o fisura en el ano\n\nSubyacente condiciones - algunas condiciones subyacentes, como enfermedad de Crohn, colitis ulcerosa y otras enfermedades inflamatorias del intestino puede causar \u00falceras que se forman en la zona anal.\n\nEl sexo anal - a veces puede causar fisuras anales (raro).", "title": "Remedios caseros y naturales para la fisura anal o fisura en el ano", "publishedDate": "2014-05-25T22:48:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rd-XVATJbA", "description": "Para doar: http://www.abrela.org.br/ \nBanco: Santander / Ag: 3919 / C/C: 130001906.\n\nSe inscreva no canal e fique atualizado com v\u00eddeos novos!\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/jeremias.fernandes2013\nTwitter: @JeremiasVlogger\nInstagram: @jeremiiasfernandes", "title": "DESAFIO DO GELO - JEREMIAS FERNANDES", "publishedDate": "2014-09-11T18:01:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4reKNE832Fc", "description": "Nile City. \u00c4r du k\u00e4ndis eller?

'cardiac' is a diligently produced aural state of mind lying in the realm of experimental electronica - a delicate balance between fragility and gravity, ambience and rhythms. the ten tracks are built around abstract melodies, complex textures and warm synth tones, driven by expertly crafted and varied beat patterns, layered with sweeping modulated waves, glitches and noises. the 180gram vinyl version includes a download code for the album tracks plus 3 exclusive digital songs. limited to 100 copies.\n\nVideo created with the Prelinger archives archive.org/details/prelinger", "title": "nebulo 'CARDIAC '  LP / CD previews _ hymen-records_ 24.10.2012", "publishedDate": "2012-10-24T18:27:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rn42R63Xts", "description": "TVP 70-te lata", "title": "Bemibek - Podaruj mi troch\u0119 s\u0142o\u0144ca (TVP Opole 1972)", "publishedDate": "2014-08-02T14:14:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rn9jqRsK8w", "description": "http://www.teachastronomy.com/\nThe cosmic abundance of different elements in the periodic table is a fundamental property of the universe that astronomers have successfully explained.

Helium was created in the first few minutes of the universe itself.  Almost all the heavier elements come from nucleosynthesis within stars.  The features of a graph of cosmic abundance versus atomic number show that after hydrogen and helium there's a deep hole in abundance.  Boron and beryllium are extremely rare elements because the decay prohibits them from being built up rapidly.  There's then a peak, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the life elements, at abundances of 10-4 relative to hydrogen, then a slow decline, elements like magnesium and silicon at an abundance of 10-5 relative to hydrogen, and the pattern of elements show a sawtooth pattern every two in atomic number representing the addition of a helium nucleus in the way that the elements are built up.  Then follows the iron peak, iron the most stable element, followed by a rapid fall down to abundances of only 10-9 or 10-10, silver and tin are at abundances of 10-11 , and then slow decline to the heaviest elements of all; gold has an abundance of 10-12 relative to hydrogen.", "title": "Teach Astronomy - Cosmic Element Abundance", "publishedDate": "2010-07-24T04:00:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rnM3YzwWYM", "description": "Leatherhead Choral Society at the Leith Hill Musical Festival 2009", "title": "Chattanooga Choo Choo", "publishedDate": "2009-04-25T11:51:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rn_eME0k8k", "description": "Celebrity spotting in Beverly Hills.\n\nMain Channel: http://www.youtube.com/edbassmaster\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OfficialEdBassmaster\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/edbassmaster\n\n---\nedbassmaster comedy funny \"man on the streets\" prank pranks joke jokes \"hidden camera\" \"Beverly Hills\" Beverly Hills California \"free video\" \"Maker Studios\" \"Larry King\" \"celebrity sighting\" celebrity sighting", "title": "Celebrity Spotting (Don't I Know You?)", "publishedDate": "2012-06-08T00:27:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "4rnrHvN8n1c", "description": "Science popularizer and the \"Strange Universe\" columnist for Astronomy magazine, Bob Berman spoke on \"biocentrism\" at the 2009 IdeaFestival.

The first part of the video was taken in real time, so the amoeba appears nearly motionless. However, in the time-lapse segment, we can see the amoeba moving slowly, with the particles in its cytoplasm moving as well.\n\n----- Commentary by Prof. Yuji Tsukii, Hosei University  -----\nIt is difficult to say what type of amoeba this is. It might belong to Heliozoa as the cell shape does not change. However, some smaller Heliozoa with very thin pseudopodia have recently been reclassified from the Heliozoa group to the Filosea group, including Rabdiophrys and Pompholyxophrys. As the organism in this video appears to have very thin pseudopodia, it might be Rabdiophrys belonging to Filosea. \nSmall Heliozoa(and other small amoebae) are often found in the field, but to what group these organisms should be classified can be perplexing. \nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Sarcodina/Heliozoa/Rabdiophrys/index.html\nhttp://protist.i.hosei.ac.jp/PDB/Images/Sarcodina/Heliozoa/Pompholyxophrys/index.html", "title": "\u6b63\u4f53\u4e0d\u660e\u306a\u30a2\u30e1\u30fc\u30d0An amoeba with a strange shape", "publishedDate": "2012-07-12T08:07:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "4s0lo8uAeWk", "description": "Photographed at Kellys Slough NWR, North Dakota (31 July 2010).", "title": "Carolina Grasshopper (Acrididae: Dissosteira carolina) Nymph", "publishedDate": "2010-08-01T16:47:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4s0yJAIk95Q", "description": "Hong Kong popular dessert - Taro Sago\n\nIngredients:\n3 Taros\n1 cup Uncooked Sago\n100 gram Creamed Coconut\n2.5 cups Water (plus 3 cups for cooking the sago)\n1 cup Whole Milk (skip it if using coconut milk)\n400 gram Rock Sugar\n* 3/4 cup coconut Milk, if use\n\nPlease visit my blog for more recipes:\nhttp://misswongskitchen.blogspot.ca", "title": "How to make Taro Sago \u828b\u982d\u897f\u7c73\u9732 (Hong Kong popular dessert)", "publishedDate": "2013-09-16T20:12:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "4s1uEi3Vero", "description": "Automaton pendant\nsilver, copper, bronze, vitreous glass enamel\n2014\n\nMade for Lillstreet Art Center's exhibition Earthly Delights: Metalsmiths Inspired by Nature in conjunction with their Art and the Urban Garden Show.", "title": "Seafan Garden Mechanical Necklace made by art jeweler Kim Nogueira", "publishedDate": "2014-04-25T21:51:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "4s2EuWjiDOs", "description": "Take a trip out to sea with Captain Dave and the crew of Shiny Maine Lobster as they share the excitement of catching some Maine lobsters in Biddeford, Maine.

Suppliers are absolutely clear that they are required to meet our stringent specifications and that we do not tolerate any failure to do so.\n\n\"We have acted quickly to withdraw the affected products from sale, conduct additional testing and review the performance of our suppliers.\n\n\"The products from Comigel will not be sold in our stores again and we will no longer take any product from Comigel.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor Food Standards Agency guidelines on this matter and take appropriate action that is in the interest of our customers.

We already have rigorous testing systems in place, but clearly we need to do more to ensure that our suppliers are complying with our high standards.\n\"Aldi will not tolerate any supplier who fails to comply with our requirements and we will support any appropriate legal action taken against any supplier that knowingly does wrong.\"\n\nAldi said while it was \"confident that these products are safe\", the products were being tested for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or \"bute\", which is not allowed to enter the food chain in Britain as it may pose a risk to human health.\n\nThe revelation came as police joined in the investigation into the deepening horsemeat scandal, as the Environment Secretary told Sky News a \"criminal conspiracy\" may to be blame.\n\nOfficers from Scotland Yard have met with the FSA to discuss its probe.\n\n\nMr Paterson, who is holding a summit with food retailers and suppliers on Saturday, said it was \"shocking\" and \"totally unacceptable\" that products marked as processed beef were found to have contained significant amounts of horsemeat.\n\n\"To reassure the public, we are conducting an unprecedented analysis of processed beef products to see how far this either incompetence or negligence, or the criminal conspiracy extends, and we hope to have results by the end of next week,\" he said.\n\n\"Our eyes are very much open to both possibilities, and the FSA have already started working with the Metropolitan Police, who are also working with other police forces across Europe.\n\n\"If there is an international element to this, and there is a conspiracy across Europe, we need to work very closely with all our partners ... I am determined that we will work with every possible agency and get to the bottom of this,\" he added.\n\nThe French government has told Sky News it has launched a fraud investigation into the horsemeat scandal.\n\nSwedish food giant Findus has withdrawn its frozen beef lasagne products from France and Sweden itself.\n\nThe meals were produced in Luxembourg for French supplier Comigel, which in turn had used a Luxembourg supplier called Tavola.\n\nComigel, the company at the centre of the latest scare, has told the AFP news agency that the meat originated in a Romanian abattoir, and was supplied to Comigel by a meat-processing company called Spanghero, based in southwestern France.\n\nBlog : http://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com/\nFacebook : http://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews", "title": "Aldi beef lasagne and spaghetti bolognese 100% Horsemeat and could be in school meals", "publishedDate": "2013-02-08T22:20:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sA6lOOezPg", "description": "\"College GameDay\" profiles UCLA's two-way freshman sensation Myles Jack, who scored four touchdowns and made five tackles against Washington.", "title": "Jack Of All Trades", "publishedDate": "2013-11-23T16:26:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sAedy-KGy0", "description": "For the first installment of our Okay Acoustic series, Ghanaian-Canadian artist Kae Sun gives us his stripped-down, stroll-in-the-park rendition of \"Ship and the Globe\". http://bit.ly/1ibF30j\n\nMore on Kae Sun: \nhttp://www.okayafrica.com/okayafrica-artists/kae-sun/\n\nVideographers: Allison Swank + Jay Sprogell \nEditor: Jay Sprogell \n\nOkayafrica\nhttp://www.okayafrica.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/okayafrica\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okayafrica\n\nOkayplayer\nhttp://www.okayplayer.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/okayplayer\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okayplayer", "title": "Okay Acoustic: Kae Sun \"Ship and the Globe\"", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T10:45:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sAiVjbZxFA", "description": "Breaded-uhhh\n\nUPDATE: This guy is alright, he made a gaben impression\nOriginal Video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ai2c5vZGOs", "title": "Cringe Comp 15: you just got breaded!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-01-02T19:57:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sAo2jIWl5s", "description": "This is just a video I did just for fun & because I was bored. }:)", "title": "The Last Dinosaur (T rex Tribute.)", "publishedDate": "2011-11-28T13:55:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sB6CMk3mug", "description": "Dhaulagiri trek - On the way to Dhampus pass (5200m)", "title": "Dhaulagiri trek - On the way to Dhampus pass (5200m)", "publishedDate": "2008-04-20T11:08:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sBCzqFGAps", "description": "", "title": "Abbott's Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold", "publishedDate": "2013-07-29T13:12:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sBJK1FQ-SU", "description": "Log on to www.myspace.com/noseyparkerisaband for more information", "title": "last train to clarksville - the monkees - nosey parker", "publishedDate": "2009-12-18T18:23:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sBdB0uy1PE", "description": "Brave Frontier replay\n\nRecorded and uploaded with Kamcord (http://kamcord.com/v/inS7VsfKkUn/).", "title": "[Brave Frontier] Ice Keep Copra!!!

Airgun Critic Rick Eutsler, has been testing and reviewing airguns, pellet guns, bb guns, and various airsoft airguns since 2006. His daughter Naomi, helps out in many videos and loves to shoot.  Being a youngster, she's able to see very easily if something is suitable or not suitable for younger shooters.  Since airguns are a great tool for getting youngsters out shooting, it's a great to have a smaller set of hands to help with the testing and evaluation of today's airguns\n\nPellet rifles, airguns, air rifles, bb guns, and airsoft airguns are a great way to develop good shooting skills and firearms safety.  Airguns, BB Guns, & Airsoft guns are great tools for target practice, small game hunting, pest control, and maintaining firearms proficiency and discipline.  Pellet guns are also great for just having fun shooting targets in the back yard and are much safer and less expensive to operate than traditional firearms.

The locals calls it monyet belanda (\"Dutch monkey\"), or evenorang belanda (\"Dutchman\"), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and big noses.\nProboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart. Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 9--19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. One-male groups typically consist of three to 12 individuals, but can contain more. Serious aggression is uncommon among monkeys but minor aggression does commonly occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation their social status.\nProboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called \"female calls\" when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.\n\nFemales become sexually mature at five years old. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by sub-adults. Proboscis monkey may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting. Gestation usually last 166--200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant. When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide", "title": "Proboscis Monkey walking", "publishedDate": "2013-07-23T17:45:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sQvjgt_3X0", "description": "This train was seen on the 8th of February 2011 hauling bauxite ore in Discovery Bay in the parish of  Saint Ann Jamaica.", "title": "Jamaican BauxiteTrain", "publishedDate": "2011-02-09T02:06:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sR38k5H15A", "description": "Fomos na Fazenda Alto do Bonfim, antiga propriedade do Sr. Pedro e Dona Olinda, e pegamos uma muda de um \u00e1rvore frut\u00edfera do cerrado que o S\u00e9rgio chama de Sacopari.\nPesquisando cheguei a feliz conclus\u00e3o que trata-se do bacupari, uma fruta que conhe\u00e7o desde meus tempos de garoto e que me foi apresentada na Fazenda Bandeirantes h\u00e1 muito tempo atr\u00e1s.\nPlantei uma muda na beira do Taper\u00e3o.", "title": "Fazenda Garapa - Bacupari", "publishedDate": "2009-11-03T17:48:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sR48ZsPt3Q", "description": "On the Science  Channel's \"Mammals vs. Dinos,\" meet Coelophysis, a dinosaur who was a dominant force during the late Triassic.

Now it's in cross gears right now. You don't want to ride in cross gears at all. Basically that means the chain is flexed from one side to the complete other side.\n\nSo we'll shift up into the highest gear to see if our cable worked right. It worked right.\n\nNow you want to make sure you're adjusting the high limit screw. So if I adjust it too much, again, it's going to rub and make a lot of noise. If I adjust it too little, then when I go to shift to the highest gear. Doesn't work. Let's see. So if I adjust it too little then when I go from the low gear to the high gear, it has the potential to fall off. Which this one is not doing at all. There we go.\n\nSo if I adjust it improperly, and I go from the smallest gear to the highest gear, then it has the potential of falling all the way off. So you want to make sure that that is adjusted properly so it will prevent it from doing that.\n\nGreat. Now that your lowest gear here, the largest cog, the limit screw is adjusted, you want to adjust your B screw. So basically what that is, is it's pushing against your derailleur hanger, it basically sits right on the derailleur hanger and it pushes your derailleur, like that, basically.\n\nSo the purpose of this is that you can put different sized cogs according to whatever the manufacturer specifications are. So to adjust the B screw using a phillips head and you tighten it to make your derailleur go out, like that. Loosen it to go down. And basically, what you want to have is, from this jockey wheel right here, this small little plastic cog, should be about two to three millimeters away from the teeth of the largest cog or the lowest gear.\n\nSo if your B screw is too tight, basically it's going to have your jockey wheel, your highest jockey wheel here too far away from the largest cog. That's what it's looking like right here.\n\nNow, if it's too loose, what's going to happen is the jockey wheel, is gonna, these metal, these plastic teeth here, are going to hit against the metal teeth and make a lot of sound. And t's also not going to shift as well. \n\nSo when you're adjusting the screw, you want to make sure that your jockey wheel teeth are the proper specification away from the largest cog here, the teeth, so they're not hitting and also so they're not too far apart. Most manufacturers tell you it's usually around two or three millimeters between the plastic teeth and the metal teeth.\n\nSo that's how to adjust your derailleurs and keep your chain running smoothly.", "title": "How to Adjust a Bike B-Screw | Bicycle Repair", "publishedDate": "2013-08-11T14:43:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "4smE-k-aoPk", "description": "Director & VO: Hyacinth Jael Sigua\nActor: Reign Alcaeus Sigua\nCameo Apperance: Ate See", "title": "A Reward For Jerry", "publishedDate": "2013-06-23T13:44:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4smduK0Wlq8", "description": "90\" Wing Span RC Fairey Gannet Flap Test", "title": "RC Fairey Gannet Flap Test", "publishedDate": "2013-06-02T09:07:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "4smm8cfTVbs", "description": "Perpetrat\u00f6r is a Thrash Metal band from Portugal.

Alston, C.J. Kettler, George Morfogen, Peggy Robertson, Martin Starger\nScreenwriter: Anna Hamilton Phelan\nFilm Description: This is the true story of Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz), a personable young man suffering from \"lionitis,\" a fatal disease which causes hideous facial disfigurement. The son of freewheeling biker Rusty Dennis (Cher), Rocky is accepted without question by his mom's boyfriends and cycle buddies, but treated with pity, condescension, and disgust by much of the outside world. The local high school principal tries to get Rocky classified as brain-damaged so he won't have to enroll the boy in his school, but Rusty fights for her son's rights with the ferocity of a mother lioness. Rocky makes friends easily both at school and at summer camp. He also falls in love with Diana (Laura Dern), a blind girl who cannot see his deformed countenance and is entranced by the boy's kindness and compassion. Now that he's got his own life in order, Rocky sets about to wean his chronically depressed mother from her drug habit. Mask is the sort of story that might have ending up wallowing in its own pathos had the acting, direction and scriptwriting (by Anna Hamilton Phelan) been anything less than very good. The film proved a much-needed financial success for director Peter Bogdanovich, though unfortunately it didn't come soon enough to stave off his declaring personal bankruptcy.\n\nmask,\"mask clip\",\"masked kane returns 2011\",\"maskara boy\",\"masked kane\",\"laura dern\",\"eric stoltz\",\"peter bogdanovich\",\"apple videos\",\"camera videos\",\"knife videos\",\"biographical dramas\",drama,tearjerkers,\"george morfogen\",\"martin starger\",\"cj kettler\",\"howard p alston\",\"peggy robertson\",\"acceptance videos\",\"attitude videos\",\"fear videos\",\"respect videos\",\"understanding videos\",\"beach videos\",\"roy lrocky dennis\",\"diana adams\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++31673,/m/033tln,/m/09zmys", "title": "Mask (8/10) Movie CLIP - Rocky & Diana (1985) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-31T02:45:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "4sndfnW27YQ", "description": "Quick correction for forward shoulders or pectoral tightness.", "title": "Scapular Positioning", "publishedDate": "2012-04-13T14:50:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "4snjwlVtMDI", "description": "A great video of a spring gobbler hunt in southern manitoba.

I'd like to ask about the following. We all have to pay to save our common currency, the euro. I'd like to know how we can make sure this isn't pouring money down the drain. With the Greek debt crisis, the whole eurozone has in the end been weakened. The end of the euro presents an incalculable risk and so to avoid bankruptcy the eurozone must be stabilised. Besides the European Central Bank's monetary policy and after strengthening the budget stability pact, the proposed solution is called the ESM, the European Stability Mechanism. Its role is to make loans to states in difficulty with or without the help of the IMF. But states won't be bailed out without conditions. To benefit from the ESM, a state will first have to go to the IMF, while respecting the ECB's independence, and it will have to apply much stricter budgetary rules. But how will the ESM work? The ESM will represent the 17 eurozone members. A director general will be appointed. The Commission and the ECB will be able to be observers if they wish. But ESM members won't have the same weight. The largest shareholder will be Germany with 27% of the capital. The second shareholder will be France, followed by Italy. Malta, the smallest eurozone country, will be the smallest shareholder. After some hesitation, the capital of the ESM was set at 700 billion euros, of which 80 billion will be released at first. The states will fund the ESM directly. The money will serve as a guarantee to raise other sources of capital. These funds could then be made available to a country in difficulty, in return for payment of interest. Only states willing to tackle their problems will be helped. At the request of Germany, all financial aid will be subject to strict conditions. The eurozone will intervene if the country has asked the IMF for help and if it undertakes to reform itself. If the country helped doesn't respect its obligations it will have to pay a fine in addition to its contribution to the ESM, and of course it will not be able to receive any more aid. But who will control the activities of the European Stability Mechanism? MEPs regretted the fact that neither the EP nor national parliaments will have a say in that. They will be informed of ESM decisions, but won't be able to oppose them. Supervision of the ESM will be entrusted to internal and external auditors appointed by the ESM.

Watch as Parents Magazine defines different methods of discipline for some easy parenting tips to try. Discipline means \"to teach,\" and through discipline, your child learns self-control. Positive discipline means you show respect, listen, reward good behavior, and remind your children that you love them when teaching them right from wrong. Negative discipline, such as spanking, leads to fear and low self-esteem. There are eight key points to positive child discipline -- be a good role model, be consistent, be calm and brief, be quick, pick your battles, be realistic, catch your child being good, and remind your child that you love him. Your child's behavior won't change immediately, but it's important to start utilizing these discipline techniques early on for effective parenting.", "title": "Parenting Tips - What is Positive Discipline?", "publishedDate": "2013-02-19T17:27:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tBmZMGjObM", "description": "SLEEPING GIANT - Finished People (Featuring Nathan Rebolledo of XIBALBA)  (Album Track).

The pieces were written almost entirely in Medieval Latin; a few in Middle High German, and some with traces of Old French or Proven\u00e7al. Many are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular.\nThey were written by students and clergy when the Latin idiom was the lingua franca across Italy and western Europe for travelling scholars, universities and theologians. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who sent up and satirized the Church. The collection preserves the works of a number of poets, including Peter of Blois, Walter of Ch\u00e2tillon and the anonymous one, referred to as the Archpoet.\nThe collection was found in 1803 in the Bavarian monastery of Benediktbeuern and is now housed in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Along with the Carmina Cantabrigiensia, the Carmina Burana is the most important collection of Goliard and vagabond songs.\nThe manuscripts reflect an 'international' European movement, with songs originating from the following countries, Occitanie, France, England, Scotland, Switzerland, Aragon, Castille, Germany.", "title": "Carmina Burana: Exiit dilucolo rustica puella", "publishedDate": "2009-06-27T21:38:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tCuHJKj0w4", "description": "https://twitter.com/EmilFeyruzzade", "title": "Muck - Le\u015f \u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc Komik Rap \u015fark\u0131s\u0131", "publishedDate": "2012-02-10T11:47:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tD09BzGGCk", "description": "Haifa Wehbe\nis a Lebanese singer and actress who rose to fame in the Arab world as runner up in Miss Lebanon and later through the release of her debut album Houwa El-Zaman in 2002.\nShe is known through her music for her beauty, showmanship, sex appeal, provocative mannerisms and image.

The first protection measure against static electricity when working with electronic components, boards and devices is using an antistatic wrist strap, and we will review the WS-11 wrist strap produced under the Goot brand as an example. It consists of a strap made of high-quality durable semiconducting fabric and the grounding system which is a contact wire where one end is connected to the wrist strap loop through a reliable terminal connection, and the other end is directly connected to the grounding conductor via a crocodile clip or in conjunction with an antistatic mat through a special connector. Highly dense conductive fabric is woven into the strap ensuring the skin contact even under small pressure that can be controlled by changing the strap length. It also should be noted that the wrist strap has a 1 megaohm ballast resistor embedded into the contact clasp, and it is used to provide safety if the ground bus catches electric current in an emergency.  Many people do not like to work with an antistatic wrist strap finding it a bit uncomfortable but as the experience of production and repair of electronic equipment shows, the antistatic equipment of the workbench should be accepted as a norm. Don't forget to connect the wrist strap to the grounded conductor as simply wearing this accessory doesn't provide antistatic protection.", "title": "Goot WS-11 Antistatic Wrist Strap", "publishedDate": "2010-11-30T20:23:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tTdChYdsyk", "description": "Luau !\nNe vous demandez pas si c'est du lard ou du cochon\nSi vous avez faim, croquez tout cru mon compagnon\nA la file indienne ch\u00e8res petites hy\u00e8nes\nVenez faire ripaille \u00e0 l'hawa\u00efenne\n\nO\u00f9 y'a d' la hy\u00e8ne\nYep, yep, yep\nY'a du plaisir \nYep, yep, yep\nR\u00e9galez-vous\n Yep, yep\nDans le cochon, on mange tout, wouh\nAAAH\n\nY'a pas dire cette sc\u00e8ne me met toujours des barres,\nJuste excellent, inoubliable et ind\u00e9modable", "title": "Le roi lion , Luau", "publishedDate": "2012-03-01T14:50:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tThW2M2--c", "description": "KUBA - Take Five\n\nhttp://kubavibes.bandcamp.com/\n\nLinks to youtube channels:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/groenelantaarn\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/jorgevogt\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/zzherc\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/76BlackNovaoutburst\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Caryotagigas\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/mbhsug\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/tragopanpt\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFC2N78S56oQGUHM3h5UXWw\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGHkJoqKaRx2UDkj1OVAfg\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ChiangYuHsiang\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/2008Belize\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/patrick19670930\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nilfisking", "title": "149 air   somePhasianinae", "publishedDate": "2013-11-12T17:18:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tTiffMaxqw", "description": "", "title": "Relative Frequency in Excel 2010", "publishedDate": "2013-01-25T01:34:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tUAhkll3VE", "description": "Information on scoring rush greater horsetail.

Most ingested cholesterol comes from animal and dairy products. Select lean meat with minimal visible fat. Drink nonfat milk.\n\nTip\nConsider going vegan, which means giving up all animals products, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Many people have seen their cholesterol levels drop after going vegan.\n\nStep 5: Get food recommendations\nGet specific cholesterol-lowering food recommendations from authoritative resources like the Mayo Clinic and the American Heart Association.\n\nDid You Know?\nIn 1963, ventriloquist Paul Winchell patented an artificial heart considered a prototype for Jarvik-7, the first successfully implanted artificial heart.", "title": "How to Eat Foods That Reduce Cholesterol", "publishedDate": "2011-02-23T15:24:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "4tVOY6_L22g", "description": "Caluhan, like many Dachshunds, ruptured a disc in his lower back and had to undergo surgery to decompress his spinal cord.
