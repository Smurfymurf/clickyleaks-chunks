Released on September 11, 1970, connections were confident it would at least make the UK Top 50. She'd just received a gold disc for her Eurovision-winning million-seller, so was very disappointed in the lack of interest shown in this catchy pop song and its equally good B-side, With a Little Love (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfInF5...).\nNewspapers were calling her a one-hit wonder, but her agent, Dick Katz, told her: \"Well, DANA, now it's your choice. You can go back to Derry and live a normal life or you can stay here and fight!\" Thank goodness she stayed. And thank goodness I eventually got to upload this rarity, seeing as I named my channel after it!\nIt was always meant to be...and whoever came up with the telephone box idea made the right call.\nTrivia: The demo disc of this song that was offered to DANA was produced by Bruce Welch of The Shadows, her favourite group (until The Beatles arrived). And the singer on that demo was a girl he was trying to promote, Olivia Newton-John. The Shadows first hit, like DANA's, was a #1: Apache was written by Jerry Lordan, who also wrote their wonderful Wonderful Land (#1) and Atlantis (#2), as well as Diamonds (#1) and Scarlett O'Hara (#2) for Jet Harris and Tony Meehan (both former Shadows). These were all instrumentals, but he could write pop songs, too, such as I Will Follow You!\nUPDATE: Having said all that, according to the label, this song was written by P A Jordan, Petrina Ann, his ex-wife! Unless he wrote in her name. Yet the sleeve notes on DANA's 1990 Decca compilation CD, All Kinds of Everything, state that he did write it. But the song wasn't included on the disc!", "title": "DANA #5 - I Will Follow You 1970", "publishedDate": "2011-08-29T19:17:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1iZsB4pid4k", "description": "", "title": "5 HTP GULL levels of attainment", "publishedDate": "2010-10-08T13:35:51.000Z"}, {"_id": "1i_3TfEqv1E", "description": "The virtue of Non-craving, from the 28 Virtues of Glorious Living!, by acclaimed author Steve Morris", "title": "Non-craving", "publishedDate": "2007-12-14T00:46:03.000Z"}, {"_id": "1i_i_vyR9Pc", "description": "Super revis\u00e3o Col\u00e9gio Ideal - 23/11/2008 para 1\u00aa fase da Unioeste -\n\nProfessor Vagner (qu\u00edmica) falando sobre Amina e Amida.", "title": "Professor Vagner", "publishedDate": "2008-11-24T02:36:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "1i_tmwucpZg", "description": "http://midwestballers.com/ - The top plays from the month of December featuring some of the best ballers in the Midwest including Lamonte Bearden, Kevon Looney, Riley LaChance, Diamond Stone, Tyquone Greer and more!", "title": "Midwest Ballers TOP PLAYS: December 2013 Ft.

Do this for 5-6 times each in the morning, afternoon, evening, and at night.    \n\n\n\nAt 39th week of pregnancy, start rubbing both your nipples gently between your fingertips for an hour or so for three times a day.\n\nIntercourse\n\n\n\nIf your delivery is overdue, it is a good idea to have an intercourse. Seminal fluid is rich in prostaglandin hormones which are known to ripen the cervix and stimulate labour contractions. \n\nWhen your doctor suggests you of inducing labour, talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits for both you and your baby, such as the risk of low birth weight and the risk of c-section.\n\nYou need to be sure that the benefits of inducing labour outweigh the risks of labor and the risks of continuing your pregnancy.", "title": "How to induce labor \u2013 How to start labour on your own naturally", "publishedDate": "2014-08-20T15:22:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ikkqnJNmk0", "description": "Eurovision Song Contest 2007 - Festival de Eurovisi\u00f3n 2007\nBelarus - Bielorrusia\nKoldun - Work your magic\nMusic / M\u00fasica: Philip Kirkorov\nLyrics / Letra: Karen Kavaleryan\nPlacing / Puesto: 6th (145 points)\nSubtitled in English and Spanish\nSubtitulado en espa\u00f1ol e ingl\u00e9s", "title": "Eurovision 2007 - Belarus - Koldun - Work your magic [HD 720p STEREO SUBTITLED]", "publishedDate": "2012-06-21T20:20:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ikm3hyjOGA", "description": "Gran Remate de Caballos Chilenos del Criadero Torre\u00f3n del Sr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urrutia | S\u00e1bado 26 Julio 2014 | Medialuna Gil Letelier.\n612 CANDIDATA Criadero Torre\u00f3n", "title": "612 CANDIDATA Criadero Torreo\u0301n", "publishedDate": "2014-07-16T11:56:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ilTXHUtaI0", "description": "Scene of Bailiff opening and closing door, Media and network analyst leaving courtroom, and a solution to Take Back America from evil people like Tom Sneddon, Ron Zonen, Gordy Auchincloss, and Mag Nicola", "title": "Michael Jackson TRIAL - - Bailiffs - - May 25, 2005  footage", "publishedDate": "2010-06-25T01:08:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1iloNr08qWY", "description": "", "title": "James Franco Inhales his Coffee", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T16:46:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ilogTkyAZg", "description": "Il trailer del Nuovo film di Corrado da Ostia.\ncon: El mariachi, lasposa, assurbanipal, bokassa e asheart", "title": "Metal Gear Mariachi", "publishedDate": "2008-06-03T13:22:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "1imVCPtwM0Y", "description": "Saint Vitus recording a demo of the new song \"Blessed Night\" @ Temple Sound.

Incidentally, we happen not to like that very much. \n\n(for more info on pathogen cultivation see Adiba et al. 2010 PLoS ONE (open access) http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011882)\n\nFreshwater, sampled fall 2010, Vancouver.", "title": "Hartmannellid with eruptive motility", "publishedDate": "2011-05-02T06:51:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "1ivbcWX1v1I", "description": "Return Top: Wooly Marmot 2\nTrick Concept Founder: Jensen\nMusic by Jensen Kimmitt\nPlayer: Jensen", "title": "CLYW Cabin Tutorials - Captain Laceration North", "publishedDate": "2014-04-23T21:12:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "1iw0Plrk51Y", "description": "", "title": "NEW Cathode Ray Experiment Animated.flv", "publishedDate": "2012-02-22T12:49:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1iwAbEXgpic", "description": "And let it be known that on June 12th, 2014 at 2:26 AM (EST), I pannenkoek2012 collected the impossible coin!\n\nYou see, when you exit water from the side, there's a single frame when Mario is able to jump.

Check out this guideline before you hoist your next mug.\n\n\nStep 1: Start with a clean glass\nAlways start with a hand-washed, air-dried glass. And never put it in the freezer: Experts say chilling the glass compromises the beer's flavor.\n\nTip\nA study found that a thin glass actually keeps beer colder than a thick one. \n\nStep 2: Grab a beer mug\nGrab a beer stein, a mug, or a German mug made of glass called a seidel, when you're pouring American and English ales, stouts, or bock beer. Mugs and steins are good for gatherings that involve lots of toasting, thanks to the handle.\n\nStep 3: Have a pint\nHave pale ales, bitter, porters, and stouts in a pint glass. It comes in two sizes: In the U.S., the 16 oz. tumbler, and in Britain, the 20 oz. nonic. Just drink them fast if you don't like you beer warm; the wide mouth can't keep them cool for long. \n\nStep 4: Use a pilsner glass\nUse the slender, tapered glass known as a pilsner when you drink its namesake. It also complements lagers.\n\nStep 5: Belt down Belgian beer\nDrink Belgian beer from a tulip-shaped glass. It helps maintain the head, which in turn helps the drinker appreciate the beer's esters, or fragrant compounds.\n\nTip\nA brandy snifter works, too. \n\nStep 6: Get \"weiz\"\nDrink wheat beer, also known as Weizenbier, in the glass named for it \u00ac\u2013 the Bavarian weizen glass. It's shaped like an hourglass to accommodate a big head of foam. \n\nStep 7: Try a wine glass\nTry a large wine glass that leaves enough room for a decent head to form. You may feel silly, but the shape enhances the taste of beer the same way it elevates the flavor of wine \u2013 by bringing out the aroma. \n\nDid You Know?\nGermans began using steins, stoneware or metal beer mugs with lids, in the 15th century after the Black Death as a sanitary precaution.", "title": "How to Choose the Right Beer Glass", "publishedDate": "2009-11-10T15:35:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "1jct6r2NLCI", "description": "A commercial for Norwegian association of the blind.

The goose honks and startles the driver. \n\nA man stands outside a bus shed waiting for the bus. Next to him is a donkey wearing a leading harness. A green bus stops and the back door is opened. The man tries to get the donkey to enter the bus, but the donkey refuses to budge.\n\nA young woman is out shopping for clothes with her sheep, wearing a leading harness. The man working in the shop is observing them as the sheep lets its droppings role out onto the floor beneath a row of shirts.\n\nBack to the taxi: The driver ducks down as the goose flaps its wings. Now we see there is a woman next to the goose, and that the goose wears a leading harness. \n\nA man is at the reception desk in a hotel talking to a female employee. He has an alpaca with a leading harness next to him. The man lets go of the leading harness while looking for something in his pocket. The alpaca notices its freedom and sets off out the door.\n\nBack to the donkey refusing to enter the bus: The female bus driver has come to help the man. The donkey on the other hand, pulls the man with him in the opposite direction behind the bus shed. The driver shouts after him: \"Does that usually end well?\" \"Oh, yes\" the man says, as he hangs onto his guide donkey.\n\nA maxi taxi has difficulties backing out into a busy street. We can see that it is difficult for the taxi driver to look out the window at the back. In one of the seats there is a woman, and behind her there is a big moose. There is a leading harness in one of the seats.\n\nBack to the donkey and the bus: Three people have now come to help the man and the driver to get the donkey to enter the bus. All together they try to push the donkey in the back door of the bus, but the donkey still refuses to budge.\n\nPeople are eating in a restaurant. At one of the tables there is a man and a woman. Next to them there is a big bull chewing hay. We can see that the waiter is cleaning bread crumbs off one of the tables. He then swings a clean, red table cloth over the table to put it on. The bull looks up, stops chewing and bellows. The waiter looks up from his table terrified. Then we hear the sounds of people shouting and glass breaking.\n\nA woman is at a taxi stand with a golden Labrador wearing a leading harness sitting next to her. On the screen it is now written: \"It could have been worse\". We see the golden Labrador close up, then the text: \"It is only a dog we would like to bring with us\". The taxi driver opens the door for the woman, and her dog who is wagging his tail.\n\nWe now see the logo of The Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted.", "title": "Norwegian

Over 200 attended and stayed for the duration of the three hours Petraeus was inside the building teaching.\n\nSix protesters were arrested and charged with resisting arrest at the tail end of the mid-September weekly rally, which is billed \"Every Week, David!\". Since then, over 450 academics and graduate students have signed a letter calling for the dismissal of Petraeus.\n\nPetraeus was the former commander of U.S. forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He is teaching a class called \"Are We Approaching The North American Decade?\". His salary was originally $200,000 to lecture for three hours a week, but was cut following widespread outrage. Salaries for full-time professors at the City University of New York are as low a $333 per week.\n\nThe weekly demonstrations outside of Macaulay are organized by the Ad Hoc Committee Against The Militarization of CUNY. The chief organization in the committee is the Revolutionary Student Coordinating Committee (RSCC). The City University of New York is the largest public university in the urban United States, consisting of 24 colleges and campuses across the five boroughs.

So, I got my camera to take a video of it. To my surprise, it was already missing when I returned.\n\nI think I really have to transfer my caterpillars to some jar or an old aquarium.\n\nHawk moth, name for the members of a family, Sphingidae, of large moths found in many parts of the world. They are also known as sphinx moths. They have stout bodies, relatively small, narrow wings and long tongues or proboscis. They fly chiefly at dusk.\n\n Because the hawk moths have relatively heavy bodies (packed with powerful muscles) and small, narrow triangular wings, they are not able to glide and can fly only with fast powerful beats. The wings moving so quickly that they can be seen only as a blur. The hawk moths can hover, with furiously beating wings, in front of a flower, extend their long tongue and suck up nectar without alighting.  Some of them can even fly backward.\n\n The caterpillars of hawk moths or sphinx are usually impressive and large, which in most species have a sharp horn at the rear end. Like most moths, their pupae are brown and smooth.A great many moth caterpillars merely dig down into the ground and there pupate with no cocoon.\n\nFor the \u201cPandakaki\u201d hawk moth,which I have called as such because the caterpillars lived on the leaves of the medicinal \u201cPandakaki\u201d plant, it took fourteen days in the pupal stage before the imago or the adult moth emerged.\n\nSources:  Grolier\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Knowledge\u201d 1962, Volume 18, pp. \n                     6523-6540.\n        Encyclopedia International 1969 Volume 12, p.302 and \n                      Volume 8, p. 349.\n\nThese moths, Daphnis Nerii, are known as the Oleander Hawk Moth or Army Green Moth found in Mangaon, Maharashtra, India However, there the caterpillars feed mainly on oleander (Nerium oleander) leaves, a highly toxic plant to which toxicity they are immune. They also may feed on most plants of the Dogbane family, such as Adenium obesum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata and Alstonia scholaris in India.\n\n         The newborn caterpillars are pale blue. Their color changes to green as they grow. They have two spots resembling eyes on the forefront of their body.\n\n       The pupa is pale reddish or brownish-white and has a wax-like appearance. It lies directly on the earth, under moss or dry leaves.\n\n       Daphnis nerii is a large hawk-moth found in wide areas of Africa and Asia. It is a migratory species, flying to parts of eastern and southern Europe during the summer, particularly Turkey.\n\nSource: Wikipedia, \"Hawk Moth\" and \"Daphnis Nerii\".", "title": "Lovely Pets (Uncut 21) A Hawk Moth Caterpillar Is Changing.MOV", "publishedDate": "2010-01-05T15:04:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1kLCmigJo90", "description": "Interessanter Kurzvideo \u00fcber ein Erdcham\u00e4leon (Rampholeon temporalis) welches eine Wachsmade \"schie\u00dft\"", "title": "Erdcham\u00e4leon Rampholeon Temporalis", "publishedDate": "2012-03-19T21:31:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1kLGx4OyV0k", "description": "http://houseinspectionhelp.com Click on This Link to learn more about your home.

When Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) moves to South Central L.A. to live with his father (who appears to be the same age he is) and grandmother (who likes to talk tough and smoke reefer), he falls in with his gang-banging cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans), who along with the requisite pistols and Uzi carries a thermo-nuclear warhead for self-defense. Will Ashtray keep living the straight life or will he join up with Loc Dog's gangsta homeboys? And is his romance with self-styled poet Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones) going to go anywhere? Big brother Keenen has a small role as a mailman.\n\n\"don't be a menace\",\"don't be a menace clip\",\"don't be a menace part 1\",\"don't be a menace trailer\",\"tracey cherelle jones\",\"paris barclay\",\"paper videos\",\"pencil videos\",comedy,\"late night comedies\",\"spoofs and satire\",\"eric l gold\",\"mark burg\",\"marlon wayans\",\"shawn wayans\",\"keenen ivory wayans\",\"dan genetti\",\"carrie morrow\",\"cristal rivera-mitchel\",\"abandonment videos\",\"aggression videos\",\"creativity videos\",\"violence videos\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++135586,/m/030g9z,/m/043q4nc", "title": "Don't Be a Menace (9/12) Movie CLIP - Dashiki's Poem (1996) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-11-23T06:40:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "1kjBD8swVG8", "description": "", "title": "Part 1 -  18 July 2014 Camber Sands - MCS, Gust Front, Storm", "publishedDate": "2014-07-18T22:13:56.000Z"}, {"_id": "1kjIRxfbWIQ", "description": "FREE FALL is now available on DVD and digital in the US and Canada from Wolfe Video. Please click thru to rent or own this movie on now! https://www.wolfevideo.com/products/free-fall/\n\nA promising career in the riot control unit, a child on the way, a loan from his parents to buy a duplex: everything is running to plan in Marc's life. Then fellow policeman Kay walks into his life at the police training academy. They start jogging together, bringing a breath of fresh air into Marc's life -- and, for the first time, he develops feelings for a man.\n\nTorn between the life he knows so well and the exhilaration of this new adventure, his life rapidly spins out of control. In this state of free fall, Marc cannot make anyone happy anymore. Least of all himself.\n\nFREE FALL is part of a new wave of powerful German cinema. Stephan Lacant's first feature film tells the dramatic tale of a man who finds himself outside the clear-cut boundaries of his world. Exceptional performances from Hanno Koffler (SUMMER STORM), Max Riemelt (BEFORE THE FALL, THE WAVE, IN THE FACE OF CRIME) and Katharina Sch\u00fcttler (SOPHIIIIE!) provide a moving portrayal of what happens when life plans crumble and there is no way left to fulfil the needs of the people you love.", "title": "Free Fall Trailer Final", "publishedDate": "2013-07-23T23:06:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "1kjTJgIgBOg", "description": "This film is a part of report titled \"Complex Herbal Formulations in Traditional Healing of India.\" by Pankaj Oudhia.

The dancers' who represent the Ging wear shorter robes with masks. This dance is performed to purify the ground and to chase away evil influences.\n\nThe Black Hat dancers assume the appearance of yogis who have the power of killing and recreating life. In order to lead to the field of Buddha beings who cannot be led by peaceful means, they subdue these enemies of the Doctrine through their external compassionate anger but internally they have an accomplished peaceful mind. They have the appearance of Tantrists who are good to beings through terrifying but really accomplished acts such as killing and expelling bad spirits. By the wisdom of their knowledge, the five poisonous sins disappeared in the sphere of emptiness.\n\nThis dance can also be referred to as 'Gar' dance. It is derived from the different traditions of the Tantras (texts of Northern buddhism). They say that with the help of gods who have meditated deeply upon the mantras (sacred formulas), the 'Gar' which are the gestures of the dancers' hands are transformed into mudras (sacred mystic gestures) and their feet which pound the earth are forming a mandala (mystic geometric figure).\n\nThe Black Hat Dancers who perform the ritual for the earth firstly build a tantric mandala and then cut the demons into pieces. Thus, they take possession of the earth in order to further protect it and they dance the thunderbolt step to impress their power on it (The thunderbolt step is a particular step in the religious dances).\n\nsource - http://www.visitbhutan.com/Fest_wangduephodrang_tshechu\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

I am down to a size 4, and I started this at a size 12. I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl, and was damned if I was going to stay a say 12 forever. So I buckled down and made a change. Along the road there are bumps and there are wrenches that get thrown in the way. My daughter is now 10 months. In the last ten months we have gone from colic, to gas, to teething, to roseola, to bronchitis. So there were days where working out and eating right was a huge challenge. I am offering you a glimpse into how we get things done with a sick baby around the house. She woke up during \"my time\" at 7:30 am. She is usually a sleep until 10 am! So I made it work for us. I plopped her in her high chair and did my best to get my workout in, and keep her happy. I gave her plenty of snacks. You cannot hear it, but she is wining and laughing at the same time, and I am making seriously goofy faces at her and dancing around her.

Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. However, the term \"shark\" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as Cladoselache and Xenacanthus. Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago. Since then, sharks have diversified into over 470 species. They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive in both seawater and freshwater. They breathe through five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have several sets of replaceable teeth. Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead shark are apex predators\u2014organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. In 2006 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) megalodon undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3. Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, cow frilled dogfish dog sawsharks saw angel bullhead carpet ground mackarel ray rays tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack mako makos and kill people.

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author Peter Benchley, as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters. To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450--420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments. Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee", "title": "Man gets bitten by baby shark!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T08:09:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l6Mslytnzk", "description": "The new Wave Pro series was built from the ground up for maximum surf performance without sacrificing user-friendly accessibility.

We see a black man being pulled over, and after he's asked for his license and leans into his car (possibly to get his license, like the officer asked) the cop starts screaming at him to get out of the car barely a beat before shooting at him several times, even after he's exited the vehicle. \n\nAfter the shots are fired the man clearly tells the officer he was just trying to get his license. When asked if he was hit, he says he thinks so and continues to say he was just trying to get his license. He also says he didn't hear what the officer was saying. \n\nUPDATE: Though video was just released, this all went down Sept. 4 and appropriate action has been taken already. Highway Patrol Trooper Sean Groubert, the officer who fired the shots, has been fired and charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, according to Buzzfeed.

ABC1 TV. Australia. Jennifer Byrne Presents:\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-appreciation-by-ian-mcewan\nIt's the nature of the show that this was always going to be a conversation, not an interrogation, so some of Mr Hitchens's more egregious assertions are politely let through to the keeper ~ for instance, that he is neither argumentative nor contrarian. He's here, to talk about his memoir Hitch 22, and discussions range widely, from his childhood and the suicide of his mother to his boys' lunches with Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie and the gang. But it's when talk turns to the place of women that Byrne can no longer contain herself and the sparks really start to fly.\n\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/12/In-Memoriam-Christopher-Hitche... Vanity Fair In Memoriam: Christopher Hitchens, 1949--2011, by Juli Weiner, Dec 15th 2011. Christopher Hitchens\u2014the incomparable critic, masterful rhetorician, fiery wit, and fearless bon vivant\u2014died today at the age of 62. Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 2010, just after the publication of his memoir, Hitch-22, and began chemotherapy soon after. \"My chief consolation in this year of living dyingly has been the presence of friends,\" he wrote in the June 2011 issue. He died in their presence, too, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. May his 62 years of living, well, so livingly console the many of us who will miss him dearly\n\nChristopher Eric Hitchens (born 13 April 1949) is an Anglo-American author and journalist whose books, essays, and journalistic career span more than four decades. He has been a columnist and literary critic at The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Slate, World Affairs, The Nation, Free Inquiry, and became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. He is a staple of talk shows and lecture circuits and in 2005 was voted the world's fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. He's known for his admiration of George Orwell, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson and for his excoriating critiques of, among others, Mother Teresa, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Henry Kissinger. His confrontational style of debate has made him both a lauded and controversial figure. As a political observer, polemicist and self-defined radical, he rose to prominence as a fixture of the left-wing publications in his native Britain and in the United States. His departure from the established political left began in 1989 after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left following Ayatollah Khomeini's issue of a fatwa- calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie. The 11 September 2001 attacks strengthened his internationalist embrace of an interventionist foreign policy, and his vociferous criticism of what he called \"fascism with an Islamic face.\" His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insists he is not \"a conservative of any kind\"", "title": "Hitchens '10: \"he's moved to the right\"", "publishedDate": "2012-10-26T03:54:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l8AxZT3B20", "description": "Uberti 1873 Cattleman OM  .45 Colt Revolver -  Pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuberti 1873 cattleman 45 long colt\nuberti 1873 cattleman grips\nuberti 1873 cattleman revolver\nuberti 1873 cattleman 45 colt\nuberti 1873 cattleman for sale\nuberti 1873 cattleman hombre\nuberti 1873 cattleman 357\nuberti 1873 cattleman brass\nuberti 1873 cattleman\nuberti 1873 cattleman 45 colt\nuberti 1873 cattleman", "title": "Uberti 1873 Cattleman OM  .45 Colt Revolver -  Pictures", "publishedDate": "2014-09-03T11:49:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l8uDw-ZNUE", "description": "The Watchmaker's ,Before question's became , The Ruby Lounge ,Manchester , 9/5/14", "title": "The Watchmaker's ,Before question's became , The Ruby Lounge ,Manchester , 9/5/14", "publishedDate": "2014-05-10T03:22:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l9QQYtcXcM", "description": "Insurance Surveyors Chennai Unit organised one day Agitation against the proposed modification in the 64 um Insurance act , held at chennai on 09/10/14 under the patronage of Mr.R.K.Elango .", "title": "IIISLA (Institue of Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors) Agitation", "publishedDate": "2014-10-14T02:51:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l9ZRW_ZjCw", "description": "", "title": "On the Set with Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder [\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0440\u044b]", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T21:41:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1l9dEhh390A", "description": "Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/ODNsubs\nResidents urged to prepare for evacuation from their homes on Hawaii's Big Island as lava from Kilauea volcano quickly advances on remote village.

Are you looking for an proactive Independent Letting Agent in Hammersmith Grove W6?\n\nhttp://igcpropertyconsultants.blogspot.co.uk/p/letting-service.html\n\nIf you are looking for an excellent letting agent based in Hammersmith W6 then you have come to the right place. My name is Ian and I run a private letting and management agency, working mainly in the London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham as well as Kensington and Chelsea. \n\nWe are based in Hammersmith Grove, London W6 and provide a letting and management service that is second to none and would happily compete with any high street letting agent in London a run for their money. \n\nWe currently manage 30 properties in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and manage the letting ourselves and sometimes outsource to local estate agents in Hammersmith, West Kensington and Shepherds Bush, depending on the property. \n\nLetting a property does not merely involve opening the door for tenants and hoping for the best. The letting process starts from how you handle the first response and ends once you have agreed the price, move date and terms of any particular offer. \n\nComprehensive Letting Service:\n\nMany of the landlords we work with do not have the time or inclination to deal with phone calls, emails and viewings, let alone the administrative tasks of vetting tenants and preparing the tenancy, inventory and all other necessary documentation/ certificates required prior to the move in date.\n\nThe letting service we provide is comprehensive and involves handling responses, booking in viewings and following up on prospective tenants over the marketing period as well as negotiating the best price and terms for the tenancy. We will vigorously promote your property from day one until the offer is secured while giving you consistent feedback.\n\nAdministration: \n\nThereafter all administration is done to ensure a swift and uncomplicated move-in. On an administrative level our service would include any or all of the following depending on your needs and budget.\n\n1. Collection of funds\n2. Tenant referencing\n3. Contracts: Assured shorthold tenancy agreement (AST)\n4. Independent inventory and schedule of condition\n5. Gas safety certificate\n6. Energy performance certificate\n7. Professional cleaning service\n8. Repairs\n9. Decorating works\n10. Arranging furniture deliveries\n11. Check-in/ check-out\n\nThe tenants we would secure are generally working professionals with full references looking for a longer term contract of 12 months or more. Tenants often request 6 month break clause however you may choose either not to allow this or aim for a 9 month break as a compromise depending on the tenants and their offer. \n\nReferencing:\n\nWe will use one of the better third party referencing companies to complete the bulk of the referencing. Depending on who the tenants are, you may be eligible for rent guarantee insurance up to a certain level. The references we require to perform credit checks and full referencing would include: \n\n1. Landlord reference (ideally for past 2 landlords in the UK)\n2. Employer reference\n3. Character reference - where required\n4. Three to six months bank statements or payslips\n5. Proof of address\n6. National insurance number\n7. Copy of passport and work visa if applicable\n8. Details of next of kin\n9. Guarantor details and references if required including all of the above\n10. Full contact details\n\nBefore any tenants move in they will pay the following:\n\n1. First month rent (or more if required)\n2. Six or eight week deposit*\n\n\nTenant Find Only Service:\n\nIf you do not require any or all of the above then we can offer a tenant find only service whereby we market your property, negotiate an offer and then hand over the tenants to you. You would then need to complete referencing and arrange the inventory and all other necessary certificates etc. That said, we will still be able to recommend contractors and an inventory clerk for you to obtain a quote for you to compare.\n\n\nWe will happily compete with any high street agent and will provide a service that is second to none!\n\nPlease browse this website further to learn more about our service. Otherwise contact us today to obtain a quotation for our letting service.

Iron values of consistently greater than 52% Fe were returned and the iron mineralisation has been identified as hematite-goethite. Further low cost exploration is planned on the project over coming months to determine the nature and extent of potential mineralisation. Western Spur is considered to be prospective for both uranium and base metals. \n\nAfrican Iron Limited (ASX:AKI) announced further drill results from the 2010 drill program at its 80% owned Mayoko Iron Ore Project, located in the Republic of Congo, West Africa.

Specific sciatica symptoms also vary widely in type, location and severity, depending upon the condition causing the sciatica (such as a lumbar herniated disc).\n\nWhile symptoms can be very painful, it is rare that permanent sciatic nerve damage (tissue damage) will result.\n\nChiropractic is one treatment method that has been show effective, as Chiropractors are able to remove pressure from the Sciatic nerve.

Negligent loading can not only be the cause of the collision but it can also lead to an independent form of liability against another defendant.  Typical situations when that happens is a load loss where on a flat bed that's not properly strapped, the load actually shifts and falls off of the trailer, or on occasion flips the trailer.  So you want to look at issues about strapping and tarping and securing the load generally.  Other situations have to do with oversized vehicles or oversized loads, like earth moving equipment on a type of trailer that's called a drop deck or on occasion, a double drop deck.  Double drop decks and drop decks have the situation when they're crossing rail road grates perpendicular; the trailer can get hung up on the tracks.  And this obviously can lead to a horrible collision with a train.  With an oversized vehicle like a mobile home or a large boat, you also have situations with escort vehicles.  And depending on the type of roadway they're on, they either need one or two.  And they also need to have permits too, and only drive in daylight hours.  Sometime the escort vehicles have to also have law enforcement clearing the way.  Another type of loading situation we see are liquid containers.  And they can either be baffled or not baffled.  Baffled would be something like fuel where the load is actually separated in several different loads.  Non-baffled load would be like food products like milk.  A non-baffled trailer will get the super positioning of any stopping and starting and exacerbate any acceleration or deceleration dynamic in a collision.  Other types are loading, uh, logging trucks.  Logging trucks have a problem with not only their load not being secure, but the parts of the load falling off of the truck.  Another issue with logging trucks is that they go into the woods to get loaded, and therefore, they're going through rough terrain, losing marker lights, scraping up conspicuity tape, all kinds of problems with the vehicle.  Finally, with regard to sealed containers, you have a situation where the container is sealed for the security of the cargo.  The driver doesn't know how it's baffled, how it's secured, and you can have load shift within that container.", "title": "Improper Loading of the Trailer", "publishedDate": "2011-03-31T20:59:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lRlP28Y9cM", "description": "", "title": "Viktor Vaughn - Fall Back Titty Fat", "publishedDate": "2012-03-17T20:46:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lSFcktX4U0", "description": "Driving a RWD in anger for the first time in over 10 years.\n\nCould've been worse!", "title": "Rear wheel-drive rustiness", "publishedDate": "2013-10-27T07:40:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lSLLZCh14I", "description": "-- Created using PowToon -- Free sign up at http://www.powtoon.com/ .

Dan Thomas has always taken the path of least resistance - in his work life, home life and love life! But when Dan finds himself kicked out of the family home, he's faced with no option but to secretly move into the call centre where he works. Suddenly, everything that he's previously taken for granted - a well-stocked fridge, clean clothes, his friends, his self respect, even his beloved cat - are either disappearing or conspiring against him. As Dan's work/life balance spirals dangerously out of control, he's forced to break out of old habits and to dare to do something he has never had to do before - really care about someone other than himself.\n\n\"8 Minutes Idle\" \"8 Minutes Idle movie\" \"8 Minutes Idle trailer\" \"Mark Simon Hewis\" \"Ophelia Lovibond\" \"Antonia Thomas\" \"Paul Kaye\" \"Tom Hughes\" comedy \"call center\" \"love life\" family friends cat", "title": "8 Minutes Idle Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Comedy Movie HD", "publishedDate": "2014-02-11T00:15:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lXlmLG40XI", "description": "KOSLOWSKI BROTHERS in KB SHOW \nthe First Real Underground Comedy!\nwww.kb-show.de", "title": "\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0COCA COLA\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0 KB SHOW", "publishedDate": "2008-03-12T16:55:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lXoxWUuxzE", "description": "Golazo de Santi Cazorla en el entrenamiento de la Selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola. http://www.sefutbol.com @sefutbol", "title": "Golazo de Santi Cazorla en el entrenamiento de la Selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T19:32:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lXwT7mxmf8", "description": "Queen - Nevermore (Official Lyric Video)\n\nSubscribe to the official Queen channel here http://bit.ly/Subscribe2Queen\n\nSing along to 'Nevermore' with this official karaoke style Queen lyric video.\n\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

It is defined by a difference in electronegativity values of 0.4 or greater, the meaning of which shall be made clear below. All covalent bonds are polar to some extent unless the bond is between two atoms of the same element. It is best to start with a review of the standard covalent bond.\nThis is the sharing of electrons between two elements in order to have 8 electrons in the outer shell. The only exception to this is Hydrogen, which is stable with 2 electrons in its outer shell. The structure of each element gives it a different electronegativity value. This value is effectively the strength of the pull of that atom's nucleus on the electrons around it. The higher the value the greater the pull. A covalent bond is electrons moving around two atoms; they are being shared. It is the difference between the electronegativity values that determines which atom gets the larger share of the electron's time. If the electrons spend more of their time around one atom out of the pair then that region will have more negative charge than the other atom.\nCarbon to Carbon Bond\nThe first example is the standard Carbon to Carbon bond such as occurs in the alkane molecules. We are just considering the bond that these two atoms share without regard for any other bonds that this pair of atoms may be involved in.\nFirst we can draw the two atoms as shown below. The pair of electrons that form the bond are drawn between them. The values written below the atoms are from the electronegativities table. The difference is calculated which in this case is zero. \nA polar covalent bond occurs every time Hydrogen bonds with Nitrogen, Oxygen or Fluorine as these are the three elements with the highest electronegativity values. They all have a difference of 0.9 or greater with Hydrogen.\nThese bonds are called polar because of the different charges. These act like magnets and so polar molecules are pulled toward each other, with opposite charges attracting. The polar covalent bond is commonplace. Water is a liquid at room temperature because of these bonds. Ammonia (NH3) dissolves readily in water because of these bonds. This model even explains why water expands as it freezes.\nA polar covalent bond involving Hydrogen with any of the three most electronegative elements of Nitrogen, Oxygen and Fluorine is especially strong and is called a Hydrogen bond.\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Polar Covalent Bonding", "publishedDate": "2010-05-05T06:58:14.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lnwkXb3B-k", "description": "Discover Brokerage Island commercial", "title": "discover-brokerage-island", "publishedDate": "2010-09-23T04:34:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "1loF9xCXezI", "description": "Mario Vox intervista i...???", "title": "SOON...", "publishedDate": "2011-07-08T15:47:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "1lo_TwY3p8I", "description": "*No money made on the video, just a fan practicing his editing skills*\n\nA tribute to my favorite Victorian lesbian crime fighting duo!

Perry and Aj are members of the Live Well Team at Prudential Texas Realty.  \n\nWhite mistflower is a low-growing, spreading shrub with intricate leafy branches that bear clusters of fragrant white flowers at their tips in September and October. It grows on rocky limestone hills and slopes in the Guadalupe, Chisos and Davis Mountains in the Trans-Pecos. Most Eupatorium species like moisture, but E. wrightii is more drought tolerant than most, although it may need watering during the summer in dry areas. Like fragrant mist flower, white mistflower's profuse blossoms attract butterflies and hummingbirds. Its small stature makes it most appropriate for gardens.

One of the identifying features of the Forest Shieldbug is it's squared off 'shoulders'. http://www.bugsandweeds.co.uk/bugs.html \n\nBugs in this family are extremely flattened and well-suited to living under bark; they feed on fungi and are often associated with dead trees and rotting wood. There are 7 species in the UK.  http://www.britishbugs.org.uk/gallery_het.html\n\nEcballium elaterium, also called the squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber, is a plant in the cucumber family. It gets its unusual name from the fact that, when ripe, it squirts a stream of mucilaginous liquid containing its seeds, which can be seen with the naked eye. It is thus considered to have rapid plant movement. This plant, and especially its fruit, is poisonous, containing cucurbitacins. In the ancient world it was considered to be an abortifacient : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecballium_elaterium \n\nSqueeze cucumber - Skotg\u00farka er undarleg planta af ag\u00farku\u00e6tt sem er me\u00f0 \u00f6rval\u00f6gu\u00f0 lo\u00f0in laufbl\u00f6\u00f0 og ber g\u00f6dd\u00f3tt gr\u00e6n aldin \u00e1 st\u00e6r\u00f0 vi\u00f0 h\u00e6nuegg sem sp\u00edtast af pl\u00f6ntunni \u00feegar \u00feau eru snert full\u00ferosku\u00f0 og skj\u00f3ta \u00fat \u00far s\u00e9r \u00f6llum fr\u00e6unum \u00ed blautri gusu\n\nThe squirting cucumber has been used as a medicinal plant for over 2,000 years, though it has a very violent effect upon the body and has little use in modern herbalism. The juice of the fruit is antirheumatic, cardiac and purgative. The plant is a very powerful purgative that causes evacuation of water from the bowels. It is used internally in the treatment of oedema associated with kidney complaints, heart problems, rheumatism, paralysis and shingles. Externally, it has been used to treat sinusitis and painful joints. It should be used with great caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner. Excessive doses have caused gastro-enteritis and even death. It should not be used by pregnant women since it can cause an abortion. The fully grown but unripe fruits are harvested during the summer, they are left in containers until the contents are expelled and the juice is then dried for later use. The root contains an analgesic principle: http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ecballium+elaterium\n\nFilmed with  Panasonic Lumix DMC- TZ20 camera. \n\nDavid Rudwick  - Gardens and Greenhouse at work. horticulture", "title": "Ecballium - Squeeze cucumber - shield bug - Skotg\u00farka -  Skort\u00edta - Bj\u00f6llur - Sumarbl\u00f3m", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06T16:59:54.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m3nuD7WlY4", "description": "Rikki is really weirded out of what she saw in the 1st episode!!!", "title": "Brandon werewolf ep 2 PLZ READ DESCRIPTION!!!", "publishedDate": "2014-06-25T13:59:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m3xJM7P5Js", "description": "Check us out at http://www.tutorvista.com/content/physics/physics-ii/light-refraction/glass-slab.php\n\nRefraction Of Light Through a Glass Slab\n\nA ray of light traveling from air to glass gets deviated from its original path and on emerging from the opposite side of the glass slab into the air, it again undergoes deviation due to the phenomenon of refraction.\n\n\nPlease like our facebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.com/tutorvista", "title": "Refraction Of Light Through a Glass Slab", "publishedDate": "2010-05-06T08:57:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m44j0xK8-E", "description": "Loudermilk - Elekt LIVE", "title": "Loudermilk - Elekt LIVE", "publishedDate": "2009-04-01T23:48:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m5AXHevMlo", "description": "", "title": "Sperms in young gametophyte of fern", "publishedDate": "2013-08-05T19:54:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m5d1PxZZDw", "description": "Renacuajos con 8 d\u00edas de desarrollo", "title": "Renacuajos bombina", "publishedDate": "2013-04-10T11:33:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "1m5yfKdO9rI", "description": "This Precision Lighting 0.56 watt 2700K warm white 12 volt dimmable LED festoon lamp replaces a 5 watt xenon T3, yet uses 90% less energy!

It is important that these flasks are safe so they are tested extensively!\n\nAt one of the tests where the flask was filled with water and dropped from some height a stream of water was spotted to leak out. This was unacceptable and further improvements to the flask were made.\n\nTo prove that they are safe now one was put on a train moving 100mph (~160km/h) and was crashed into another one located end of train track. The explosion was pretty massive. \nThere was some buckling and some scaring on the metal of the flask but pressure tests revealed that the contents was safe.\n\nSimilar tests go on around the world. A different test in Albuquerque. New Mexico and a different flask on a lorry. The train hurtles towards the lorry. The train is destroyed by the flask survives the 80 mph impack (~130 km/h).\n\nThen another test. A flask is put on rocket powered truck and smashed into a concrete wall. At 60mph (100km/h), the flask is unharmed, there is not even enough damage to measure. So they load it on another truck and do it all again but this time faster at 80mph. At first the flask does look as if it is damaged. But it's just a little of lorry debri. So they put it on a train powered by a rocket sled. Although everything around is damaged, the flask itself is fine.\n\nSo they make the final test putting it to 14000 deg's fahrenheit (8000 C). The flask kept cool. It survived everything they threw at it.\n\n---\nIt's Never too Late to Study:\nhttp://www.FreeScienceLectures.com\n---\nNotice: This video is copyright by its respectful owners.\nThe website address on the video does not mean anything.\n---", "title": "Nuclear Flask Endurance Testing in USA", "publishedDate": "2007-05-02T22:16:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mHxHC75Sw8", "description": "Donating = Loving: http://patreon.com/jonathanmann\n\nOut here\nThere is no purpose\nThere is no audience\nThere\u2019s only now\nNever morning\nNever afternoon\nNever evening \nThere\u2019s only now\nOne thing leads to the the next thing\nAnd then the next thing leads to the next thing\nBefore you know it, it leads to the next thing\nAnd that\u2019s all there is \n\nOut here\nThere is no weather\nThere is no mystery\nThere\u2019s only now\nYou\u2019re never tired\nYou just keep going\nYou watch the scenery\nThere\u2019s only now\nMoment fades into moment\nOne thing leads to the next thing\nStare into the darkness\nThat\u2019s all there is \n\nOut here \nThere are no dreams\nThere are no cocktails\nThere's only now\nOut here\nThere is no destiny\nYou are not special\nThere's only now\n\n\nNeed a song?

although this explanation is not universally accepted and even McCartney has given conflicting accounts over the years.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was released in August 1968 as the first single from The Beatles' record label Apple Records.\nMore than seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was, at the time, the longest single ever to top the British charts.\nIt also spent nine weeks as number one in the United States\u2014the longest run at the top of the American charts for a Beatles' single, and tied the record for longest stay at #1.\nThe single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best songs.\n\nSingle release\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968, in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom, backed with \"Revolution\" on the B-side of a 7\" single.\nThe single was the debut release of The Beatles' record label Apple Records; in the US, it was also the first Beatles' single to be issued in a company sleeve rather than a picture sleeve.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" began its sixteen-week run on the British charts on 7 September 1968, claiming the top spot a week later. It only lasted two weeks on top before being knocked off by another single from Apple, Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days\" (a song which, incidentally, if not penned was actually produced by McCartney).\nThe single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 13 September; that same week NME reported that two million copies of the single had been sold.\nThe song entered the US charts on 14 September 1968, where it stayed for nineteen weeks.\nTwo weeks later, \"Hey Jude\" was number one in the charts, and held that position for nine weeks, the longest time spent by a Beatles' single at number one, as well as being the longest-playing single to reach number one.\n\nOn 30 November 1968 NME reported that sales had reached nearly six million copies worldwide.\n\"Hey Jude\" became the biggest-selling debut release for a record label ever, selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide and topping the charts in eleven countries.\n\"Hey Jude\" was the top Billboard Hot 100 single for 1968, according to year-end charts.\nLess than three weeks after its release, the record was certified gold for sales of one million copies.\nIn 1999, it was certified 4x platinum, representing four million units shipped.\n\nCritical reception\n\nUpon the release of the \"Hey Jude\" single, Time contrasted it with its B-side \"Revolution.\" Time wrote, \"The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort\" as McCartney \"liltingly exhorts a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love.\"\nMusic analyst Alan Pollack praised \"Hey Jude,\" saying, \"it's such a good illustration of two compositional lessons\u2014how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast.\"\nHe also said it is unusual for a long song because it uses a \"binary form that combines a fully developed, hymn-like song together with an extended, mantra-like jam on a simple chord progression.\"\nPollack described the song's long coda and fadeout as \"an astonishingly transcendental effect,\" while Unterberger observed, \"What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic\".\nJohn Lennon said \"Hey Jude\" was \"one of his [Paul's] masterpieces.\"\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1969 in the Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal categories, but failed to win any of them.\nIt did win the 1968 Ivor Novello Award for \"A-Side With the Highest Sales\".\nIn the 1968 NME Readers' Poll, \"Hey Jude\" was named the best single of the year.\nIn 2001, \"Hey Jude\" was inducted into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Hall of Fame.\nIn 2004, it was ranked number 8 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nIn 2010, Rolling Stone ranked it #7 on The Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs.\nIt came in third on Channel 4's list of 100 Greatest Singles.\nThe Amusement & Music Operators Association ranked \"Hey Jude\" the 11th-best jukebox single of all time.", "title": "Assagai - Hey Jude (The Beatles Afrobeat Cover)", "publishedDate": "2012-03-08T15:24:53.000Z"}, {"_id": "1mS9V8r292Y", "description": "he Gust to reach a remarkable remembrance against the industry\u2019s leaders made Mahindra Two Wheelers to roll out \u201cGusto\u201d in India.
