So it is. Where, indeed, is that ruler or bishop who does not covet his office in order to obtain worldly honors and wealth but, rather, desires it in order to help the poor with his own hands? Since rulers and bishops do not want to come to the wedding feast prepared for everyone in heaven, the poor and weak will come instead, as I will show you by way of an example.\n\nIn a certain city lived a wise, handsome, and wealthy bishop who was praised for his wisdom and handsome looks, but did not, as he ought to, return thanks to God who had given him that very wisdom. He was praised and honored for his wealth, too, and he handed out numerous gifts with a view to worldly favor. He longed for even greater possessions so as to be able to give more gifts and win greater honor. This bishop had a learned priest in his diocese who thought to himself as follows: 'This bishop,' he said, 'loves God less than he should. His whole life tends toward worldliness.\n\nTherefore, if it is pleasing to God, I would like to have his episcopate in order to give glory to God. I do not desire it for worldly reasons, seeing that worldly honor is but empty air, nor for the sake of wealth, which is as heavy as the heaviest of burdens, nor for the sake of physical rest and comfort, since I only need a reasonable amount of rest so as to keep my body fit for God's service. No, I desire it for the sake of God alone. And, although I am unworthy of any honor, still, in order to win more souls for God and to benefit more people by my word and example and to support more people through church revenues, I would gladly take on the burdensome task of being bishop.", "title": "CANCELLED SPEECH OTTAWA CANADA COULTER MASS PROTESTS DISGUST INSTIGATOR !!!", "publishedDate": "2010-03-24T15:10:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JTjpgZ4Fy0", "description": "Trivia quiz Guess the picture Level 21 Answers", "title": "Trivia quiz Guess the picture Level 21 Answers", "publishedDate": "2014-03-01T19:54:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JU6aDpzdIY", "description": "This video was uploaded from an Android phone.", "title": "sty youngin", "publishedDate": "2012-04-22T23:24:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JUGfGBgAZ4", "description": "Brittany Maynard fue diagnosticada con un cancer cerebral terminal, prefir\u00f3 tomar la decisi\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo morir.", "title": "La \u00faltima entrevista Brittany Maynard antes de fallecer", "publishedDate": "2014-11-03T03:20:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JUJ8uyyOfQ", "description": "How to use various gemstone beads for making beaded jewelry; get expert tips and advice on homemade jewelry making techniques in this free instructional video series.\n\nExpert: Sonia Dameron\nContact: www.beadbarbead.com\nBio: Sonia Dameron has been designing and fabricating jewelry and teaching beading for over 20 years.  \nFilmmaker: Madison Paige", "title": "How to Make Beaded Jewelery : Various Gemstone Beads Used for Making Beaded Jewelry", "publishedDate": "2007-11-19T15:37:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JUtL03zaUw", "description": "Steve Butler teaches you all about  the Hot Hemmer by Joan Hawley.

He doesn't feel that he really needs a bath\u2014after all, it's a \"matter of opinion.\" \"Clean\" and \"dirty\" are \"just words, right?\" With a polished technique that logically approaches the problem, Pigeon speaks with a child's voice as he rationalizes his decision while forcefully questioning those who might even suggest that his personal hygiene and the flies buzzing around are not just \"coincidental.\" The water might be \"too hot\u2026not deep enough\u2026too cold\u2026or too wet,\" but it only takes a mere 30 tiny frames and a dramatic large-font spread before Pigeon grandly displays the myriad possibilities for a happy bird in the bath. Willems's dirt-smudged pigeon is at once clever, garrulous, energetic, and just slightly excitable. Through simple flat-line illustrations, this bird's expressions and attitude are easy to discern.

No della Cassazione alla scarcerazione di Lombardozzi. \nEcco il testo : \nHanno scelto di essere giudicati secondo rito ordinario e lo saranno, se saranno rinviati a giudizio. I pubblici ministeri della Direzione distrettuale antimafia, Emanuele Ravaglioli e Rita Fulantelli, hanno concluso la requisitoria e hanno invocato il processo, e dunque il dibattimento in aula, a carico di 11 dei 51 imputati nell' ambito della maxi  inchiesta antimafia cosiddetta \"Nuova Cupola\". Gli 11 sono  Salvatore Guarraci, 44 anni, di Porto Empedocle, Roberto Belvedere, 34 anni, di Agrigento, Antonino Gagliano, 41 anni, di Siculiana, Ettore Allegro, 50 anni, di Caltanissetta, Rosario Bellavia, 50 anni, di Siculiana, Bruno Pagliaro, 23 anni, di Agrigento, Pietro Capraro, 34 anni, di Agrigento, Gaetano Licata, 30 anni, di Santa Maria Capua Vetere e residente ad Agrigento, Gerlando Russo, 40 anni di Agrigento, Gianfranco Taranto, 63 anni, di Palermo, Carmelo Vetro, 28 anni, di Favara, gli empedoclini Maurizio Romeo, 41 anni,  e Salvatore Romeo, 54 anni, e Ludo Francesco Vazzano, 85 anni, di Ventimiglia di Sicilia. Il processo preliminare, pilotato dal Giudice per le udienze preliminari del Tribunale di Palermo, Daniela Cardamone, proseguira' lunedi' e martedi' prossimi quando interverra' la difesa. Invece, il processo, senza dibattimento ma sulla base degli atti gia' prodotti, quindi in abbreviato, iniziera' il 12 giugno a carico degli altri 40 imputati che hanno optato per il giudizio breve. E' probabile che il pubblico ministero di udienza sia Giuseppe Fici. Nel frattempo, la Cassazione ha rigettato il ricorso presentato dai difensori per la scarcerazione  del boss agrigentino, Cesare Lombardozzi. Gia' lo scorso 9 giugno, il Tribunale di Agrigento ha risposto no alla richiesta di scarcerazione proposta  perche' Lombardozzi avrebbe gia' scontato la pena, e vi e' stato un errore nel calcolo della cosiddetta \"continuazione\", l'istituto che ridetermina la pena quando si sommano diverse sentenze di condanna a carico della stessa persona per lo stesso reato. A Cesare Lombardozzi, il 9 agosto del 2011 e' stata ridotta la condanna per mafia, da 15 anni inflitti nei primi due gradi di giudizio a 13 anni e 6 mesi. Poi, anche i giudici  di Sorveglianza di Milano hanno respinto l' istanza di scarcerazione e la concessione degli arresti domiciliari per gravi motivi di salute. Lombardozzi e' stato sottoposto a un intervento chirurgico e le sue condizioni non sarebbero compatibili con il regime carcerario. Contrario e' stato il Tribunale, che ha esaminato la documentazione sanitaria. Adesso il no della Cassazione. Lombardozzi sara' detenuto in carcere fino al prossimo 15 novembre, a meno di altre contese sul conteggio delle condanne.", "title": "Ruoppolo Teleacras - \"Nuova Cupola\", lavori in corso", "publishedDate": "2013-05-25T17:16:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3JknOlSVPUg", "description": "Kurt Seyit ve \u015eura, Uluslararas\u0131 Seul Drama \u00d6d\u00fclleri i\u00e7in yar\u0131\u015f\u0131yor.

The monk and priest of this monastery noticed that a brilliant light was emitting from the blessed head of Imam Hussein A.S.  They requested the guards to allow them to keep the head for one night. The guards were reluctant but agreed after they were paid huge amount by the priests.\n\nThe head was placed on the stone that you observe in this video, and the priest were able to talk to the severed head till next day morning, and after it was given back, priest noticed that during the night few drops of blood fell from the blessed head of the Master of the Martyrs Imam Hussain A.S. on this stone.

Let's assume our basic belly dance posture position. So, the legs are right under the hip bones. Knees are bent. Lower abs are tucked, chest lifted, arms out. And now you are going to bend the knees even more than before and focus on lifting one hip at a time by straightening one knee at a time. So, as you straighten the right knee, the right hip will come up and it is going to shoot straight up into your body. So you want to think about meeting your hip bone up to the ribcage coming back down to center. Switching over to the other side, straightening that knee, coming back down. Make sure you're keeping your heels on the floor and you are not lifting up with any point. And again, lifting the hip up and back down to neutral position, the other side back down to position.

They seek to become objects of veneration: icons. Angelina Jolie, as she appears in Clint Eastwood's Changeling, is more than a mere actress or an over-publicized movie star: She's an icon of suffering. Zinedine Zidane, at least in Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno's portrait, is not simply a star athlete or even the world's greatest soccer player: He is projected as 21st-Century Man.\n\nJolie doesn't perform in Changeling; she resolutely presents herself to the audience for admiration. The main attraction in Eastwood's two-fisted snake-pit weepie is the spectacle of Jolie's steely self-possessed suffering. As she lost her husband to Islamic terrorists in A Mighty Heart, Our Lady of Humanitarian Narcissism here endures another dreadful fate: losing her child to a mob of knaves, know-nothings, and psychos, even as she's persecuted by the entire state institutional apparatus of California.\n\nBased on a forgotten tabloid saga that illuminates a particularly lurid Los Angeles guilty secret and might have appealed equally to neo-noirist James Ellroy or cultural historian Mike Davis, Changeling is set in a late-'20s L.A. that Eastwood has lovingly repopulated with the streetcars and Model T's of his own childhood. Jolie's Christine Collins is a single mom and phone-company supervisor. One afternoon, her nine-year-old son vanishes from their modest bungalow; five months later, the LAPD announces with all due hoopla that the boy has been found. A reunion is staged, reporters are invited, and although dazed Christine immediately realizes that the cops are handing her another kid, she's told to take him home on a \"trial basis\u2014he has nowhere else to go.\"\n\nThe Collins mystery is predicated at least in part on the historical Christine's extreme suggestibility. Why did she accept this strange boy as her own? But this is subsumed in a greater mystery: Who could possibly compel Angelina Jolie to do anything she didn't want to do? Despite ample physical evidence that the child is not hers, as well as assistance from a teacher, a dentist, and a self-regarding radio preacher (John Malkovich), Christine is browbeaten by the police, bullied by the press, and finally committed to a local bedlam seemingly filled with people whose mental illness consisted in pissing off the cops.\n\nThere's no denying Changeling's moldy grandeur. The movie is Eastwood's version of a silent-era melodrama (and given the anachronistic psycho-babble, it might better have been one). Who doesn't want to like Changeling? Clint Eastwood too is an icon. He succeeded John Wayne as America's greatest cowboy and, billed as America's greatest living director, glared out from the cover of last month's Sight & Sound, a craggy object of uncritical devotion. It's been many years (and many mediocre films) since the near-successive appearance of Bird, White Hunter, Black Heart, and Unforgiven established Eastwood's directorial reputation. Where the existential war film Letters From Iwo Jima attested to his viability, Changeling signals only his ambition.\n\nEastwood's latest is an effort to be bracketed with Chinatown or L.A. Confidential in mythologizing the secret history of Los Angeles. But burdened by a convoluted script and an ensemble-proof leading lady, the director fails to illuminate a particular corrupt system. Meanwhile, this static, sluggish movie grows ever darker\u2014even as it encompasses murder, pederasty, captivity, intimations of the Manson family, multiple courtroom scenes, and a death-row confrontation. For her part, Jolie reverts to her goth-girl origins\u2014her mask of tragedy suggesting a skull costumed for Halloween in a cloche hat and ghoulishly kissable wax red lips.\n\nJolie is most convincing in her demand for recognition\u2014and Eastwood is glad to oblige. Late in the movie, Christine confidently predicts that It Happened One Night will be the surprise Oscar winner of 1934. Soon after, she strikes a pose identified with Stella Dallas, the motherhood tearjerker for which Barbara Stanwyck received her first nomination in 1937. Image trumps performance. One needn't be clairvoyant to know that somewhere in Hollywood, someone is imagining her acceptance speech.\n\nhttp://www.blacktree.tv\n\nhttp://my.blacktree.tv A BlackTree Media Production  Thank you for watching!

Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, is well known as a community that is fighting against the pollution from resource extraction which they claim is causing cancers and degrading their traditional territories. Despite the many documentaries that have been produced about the Oil Sands, Fort Chip has been just a small voice amidst the cries of celebrities, scientists and politicians. This documentary is a collaborative, community effort of 33 interviews with local Cree, Dene and Metis members from Fort Chipewyan. It gets to the heart of their concerns for their families, traditional ways and territories as the Oil Sands encroach closer and closer. Produced in partnership with Mikisew Cree First Nation and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation.

Honey is a girl from the streets who works in a record store, teaches the occasional dance class at a community center, and treks downtown every weekend to hit the clubs and try out some new moves. There, she meets a music video producer (David Moscow) who offers her a chance to be a choreographer -- but at a price she eventually learns she's unwilling to pay. Determined to pick herself back up, Honey goes back to the inner-city of her youth with plans of starting a dance school. Lil' Romeo co-stars as Honey's protege; other real-life musicians (including Missy Elliott, Tweet, Jay-Z, and Ginuwine) appear as themselves.\n\nhoney,\"honey clip\",\"honey badger\",\"honey bee blake shelton\",\"david moscow\",\"missy misdemeanor elliott\",\"laurie ann gibson\",\"bille woodruff\",\"clipboard videos\",\"contemporary movie musicals\",drama,\"hip-hop contemporary dance\",musicals,\"showbiz dramas\",\"andre harrell\",\"embarrassment videos\",\"friendship videos\",\"frustration videos\",\"humor videos\",\"moving on videos\",\"rejection videos\",\"weakness videos\",\"office videos\",herself,\"michael ellis\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++285921,/m/03s4w1", "title": "Honey (10/10) Movie CLIP - Missy Wants Honey (2003) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T20:25:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KO-D9XFFTE", "description": "http://www.BlankTV.com - Lesser Men - \"Wave Walker\" - Like this video?

To understand how it works, check out the link section.\n\nIn the video I'm showing on an LCD the direction detected by the spinning of the shaft of the encoder.\n\nI connected four GPIO pins to the four signals of the encoder (A, A*, B and B*). As the frequency of inputs (square waves) can't go over 1 MHz (actually they stand at a much lower frequency), I sat up a 1MHz timer to periodically check the content of GPIO input registers. With this trick I could oversample the signals with no loss on edges so that I could use the value of registers to decode the direction of the encoder.\n\nThe decoding function is simple and I used all the four signals to get double precision of direction. Eventually, I used a little \"debouncer\" on directions, deciding it after 10 counts of phases according to the decoding functions: by doing this I partially resolved (not completely as the encoder itself is not in good conditions and it's not very sharp) problems of direction detecting related to the very fast spinning or poking of the shaft.\n\nI also sat up a timer according to which every half a second of inactivity, the state of encoder returns to IDLE. \n\nI've developed a version of the driver with two timers used as encoders. Setting up two GPIO pins in the appropriate alternate functions, you can use timers to count the edges of an external input signal (square wave in this case). The counters work well, but the encoder itself is a bit \"dirty\" in the generation of the square levels: sometimes, due to fast spinning or tapping, it generates the waves in a wrong way. I should try to clean up these problems, and maybe in the future I can think about setting up some kind of threshold for the initial part of movement detection and the passing of a given limit speed of the shaft. \n\n\n************************* Links *************************\nDigital Encoder:\nhttp://www.dynapar.com/uploadedFiles/_Site_Root/Products_and_Solutions/E14_DS_702489_2_.pdf\nNote: this is not the same I used, but it's the most similar.\n\nRotatory Decoding: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder\n\nLCM1602C LCD: \nyou can find it in the previous video.", "title": "STM32F4 - Rotatory Digital Encoder", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10T16:42:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KYZVcWG4oY", "description": "Rendering and pargeting", "title": "Smooth rendering", "publishedDate": "2008-04-30T17:13:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KY_gjMpCpc", "description": "via YouTube Capture", "title": "\u00d6versv\u00e4mning i B\u00e5stad-hamn!", "publishedDate": "2014-02-02T18:39:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KZ2BTvTPhs", "description": "The sculpture by Guido Dettoni and its development", "title": "MATER TERRA / Motherearth's Circle (English)", "publishedDate": "2007-05-15T08:59:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KZLpco1iMs", "description": "Saksikan Rising Star Indonesia \nSetiap Jumat \nPukul 21.00 WIB hanya di RCTI\n\n------------------------------\u00ad----------\u00ad-------\nDapatkan lagu-lagu dari kontestan Rising Star Indonesia di \nwww.itunes.com/risingstarindonesia \n\nDownload Application Rising Star Indonesia :\n1.

Probably the most common cause is earwax simply blocking your ear canal, and this is easily enough treated. Your primary care doctor or your internist can often irrigate this out. If it's severely impacted, you can seek a consultation with an ear, nose, and throat specialist who will have more sophisticated tools to remove the wax from your ear. There are preparations over the counter and drug stores as well that allow you to soften the wax and irrigate it. \n\nThe second most common cause of a sense of ear fullness is a problem with your middle ear space. The middle ear space contains air, and the air gets in through a tube called the Eustachian tube. The Eustachian tube connects your middle ear with the back of your nose, and this tube is normally closed. It opens by the actions of the muscles of chewing and swallowing. When you come down in an airplane or an elevator and you yawn or swallow and you ear pops, your ear pops because you are voluntarily opening your Eustachian tube and allowing air into the middle ear. \n\nThe lining membrane of that tube, the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube is the same membrane that lines your nose and your sinuses. And, we all know how quickly our nose can swell closed if we get a viral infection or a cold or an allergy, and the same is true of the Eustachian tube. If the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube swells closed, your ear will feel blocked. Treatment for this is the same as the treatment for colds. Decongestants, antihistamines, and nasal sprays. \n\nThe third most common cause of a sense of ear fullness is a problem with your inner ear. While the most common symptom of an inner ear problem is hearing loss, and the second most common is a noise or a ringing in your ear, and the third perhaps is dizziness, fourth on that list is a sense of ear fullness. And if you don't have earwax, and if you don't have a problem with your Eustachian tube, then you must have your inner ear evaluated as a possible cause for this ear fullness.", "title": "What Causes a Clogged Ear? | Ear Problems", "publishedDate": "2012-04-21T23:00:08.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KdWGevbceI", "description": "Rough Version, No Words, First Ever Recording", "title": "Refined Emotion - A Rapidly Decaying Fault In Our Society", "publishedDate": "2006-10-06T17:56:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KdwhnSvpsI", "description": "-Like / Fav / Subscribe to my channel to receive daily updates ! \n-Facebook Page - http://on.fb.me/VQRqTc\n-Free Download - http://bit.ly/Y7v3Zp\n-Twitter - http://bit.ly/RZoqVP\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\n\n-Support the artist if you like this track !!\n\n-Name - Rameses B\n-Soundcloud - http://bit.ly/TMzCEC\n-Facebook - http://on.fb.me/12C1vbL\n-Youtube - http://bit.ly/VN2e6k\n-Twitter - http://bit.ly/ZvUPG2\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\n- Image Download - http://on.fb.me/ZbbfDT\n\n\n- Follow My Social Networks\n\n- Name - LikeDeadChannelMusic\n- Youtube - http://bit.ly/WNiiQw\n- Facebook - http://on.fb.me/VQRqTc\n- Soundcloud - http://bit.ly/TXkx2C\n- Twitter - http://bit.ly/RZoqVP\n- Google + - http://bit.ly/SKuEdY\n\n\n\nWant your music on our channel send a message soundcloud or Gmail !\n- Sondcloud - http://bit.ly/T2GbF3\n- lamounier22@gmail.com\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\n\n\n\n- Melodic / Dubstep / Chillstep / Chillout / Ambient / Liquid / Trap\n- Remix / Remix / Piano / Bass / 2013 / New / Atmospheric\n- Future Garage / Wallpaper / Euphoric /\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------------\n\n- COPYRIGHT NOTICE\n\n- All songs on this channel I asked permission before has either been sent to me by the artists themselves or the label that owns the copyright of the song.

Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\", or \"koinophilia\".When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.", "title": "nail polish design ideas home", "publishedDate": "2013-08-13T20:26:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Kkd1CSjhXY", "description": "This documentary is based on tea gardens.tea gardens have their problems,there is main problem is labour problem.it is very huge & major problem.govt.should think on it & do  make some polices on it.this documentary is produced & directed by lata sahaney,music by sandeep tiwari.music is done at mumbai studio.", "title": "Assam Tea Gardens", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T16:35:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Kkkxrzp3rg", "description": "Riley Bambenek scored 18 points and Tim Wagner added 16 in a 65-51 win over Gustavus Adolphus.", "title": "Men's Basketball: Warriors vs. Gustavus Adolphus", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T03:47:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "3KllCXloG0k", "description": "", "title": "AVA egomaniac- Vetel", "publishedDate": "2011-11-08T10:02:07.000Z"}, {"_id": "3Km8yTnmzTI", "description": "Art historian Kermit Swiler Champa talks about Piet Mondrian's interest in dancing and the boogie-woogie, and considers the influence of contemporary dance on his paintings.

To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.

Cause once youve put on this cd, you wont hear any electronic beats. No synths, no riffs and no rough edged melody either. No, this release is something completely different. Its pure relaxation.\n\nThis selection of tracks is, as you might have noticed, a pack of some of the biggest trance classics around . But not as you know them.

Perfect for a quiet, cozy Sunday afternoon to give your ears some rest and bring back some warmth in these cold days around Christmas. \n\nMan behind this compilation is Finnish producer Petri Alanko, who has worked under his Lowland guise several times and brought out a range of releases, one including a team up with Orkidea, resulting in massive trance track Masochrist. This Finnish pianist and church organist studied in Lahti, and was forced to take his first piano lesson at the age of five. The good thing was, he had to be forced to leave again after that one time he just didn't want to move away from that lovely black, grand piano. Petri: \"I just wanted to stay there, to learn, to play\". After continuing his study in the P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4meen Conservatorium in Lahti, he gave his heart to electronic music in the early eighties. After graduating in 1989 he continued studying at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, where theoretic physics and musicology on one side, and house, acid and techno on the other side got his interest. He used every dime to buy synthesizers, sequencers and effect processors to learn about the music. With this Classical Trancelations project, Petri has abandoned his trustworthy, old collection of gear and has now reworked his favorite trance classics, like Energy 52 Caf\u00e9 del Mar and Armin van Buuren Communication into breathtaking orchestral compositions which all have their special touch . Whether you like your music emotional, joyful or sensitive, with Classical Trancelations youll have guaranteed listening pleasure. Just be sure youre prepared for a big dose of shivers.\n\nClassical Trancelations already received tremendous support by some of the biggest djs around.

I have a mix of the rosy color morph and the silver \"wild\" color morph in this tank. They are an active schooling fish, native to the US, extremely hardy, and can live in almost any water conditions and temperatures.  They are extremely easy to breed and the males protect their young much like cichlids do, chasing and attack fish many times their size to try and protect their young.

Attraverso l'esame delle manifestazioni della tradizione iniziatica occidentale, il film porter\u00e0 nuova luce su un lato poco conosciuto di Dante.\nUn appassionante viaggio dagli ordini di cavalleria, ai Rosacroce, fino al gruppo iniziatico del 1300 \"I Fedeli D'Amore\". Preziose guide virgiliane saranno eminenti studiosi, che accenderanno qualche luce nell'intricato groviglio di interpretazioni simboliche, succedute nel tempo. L'obiettivo di tutti, anche se in apparenza divergente, sar\u00e0 quello di suggerire nuovi percorsi verso strade pi\u00f9 illuminate.\nUn viaggio dalla circonferenza verso il centro. Dall'esteriore all'interiore. Un misterioso linguaggio, antico come il mondo. Una reminiscenza del meraviglioso mondo dantesco: da un'analisi esteriore all'evocazione di una possibile verit\u00e0 celata \"sotto 'l velame de li versi strani\". Dante continua a far riflettere e a sorprendere.\n\nUn dubbio nasce spontaneo: Esiste ancora, anche sotto diverso nome, quel gruppo iniziatico del 1300 che andava sotto il nome de \"I Fedeli D'Amore\"?\nSiamo stati contattati da alcuni di loro.\nEcco il racconto di questa ricerca.\n\n\nCon la partecipazione straordinaria di\n\nTaylor Hackford\nFranco Zeffirelli \nSilvano Agosti\n\ne\n\nS.E.

So wollte man die Milchsekretion f\u00f6rdern, eine Wirkung, die allerdings fraglich und wissenschaftlich bisher nicht nachgewiesen ist. Insgesamt gibt es bisher etwa 500 bekannte Kreuzblumenarten, von denen etwa 30 in Europa zu finden sind. Darunter ist vor allem die Polygala senaga L. aus dem Norden Amerikas hervorzuheben, eine Heilpflanze die gegen Schlangenbisse verwendet und die in Europa als auswurff\u00f6rderndes Mittel bei Brustkrankheiten sowie wegen ihrer harn- und schwei\u00dftreibenden Eigenschaften gesch\u00e4tzt wird. Die Bittere Kreuzblume besitzt \u00e4hnliche Eigenschaften wie die amerikanische Art, doch sind wegen ihres geringeren Wirkstoffgehaltes h\u00f6here Dosierungen n\u00f6tig. Au\u00dfer bei Husten, Asthma und Bronchialkatarrh wird die Pflanze zur Magenst\u00e4rkung und Verdauungsanregung verwendet.\n\nJe nach Standort wird die ausdauernde Moorkreuzblume 5 bis 20 cm hoch. Die meist unverzweigten St\u00e4ngel wachsen niederliegend und bilden aufsteigende Bl\u00fctentriebe. Am Grund der St\u00e4ngel wachsen rosettig angeordnete, elliptische, keilf\u00f6rmige Bl\u00e4tter. Die St\u00e4ngelbl\u00e4tter werden nach oben hin allm\u00e4hlich kleiner, die obersten Bl\u00e4tter sind lanzettlich geformt. Die Bl\u00fctezeit der Moorkreuzblumen erstreckt sich von April bis Juli. Die blassblauen bis wei\u00dflichen Bl\u00fcten wachsen in Trauben mit 5 ungleichen Kelchbl\u00e4ttern. Drei der Kelchbl\u00e4tter sind kelchartig, die zwei inneren Kelchbl\u00e4tter sind vergr\u00f6\u00dfert, blau und kronblattartig. Die Wurzel der Moorkreuzblumen sind d\u00fcnn, und spindelf\u00f6rmig. Der Geschmack der Pflanze ist herb und sehr bitter.\nStandort / Hier findet man die Moorkreuzblume\n\nDie Moorkreuzblume w\u00e4chst im gesamten europ\u00e4ischen Raum. Die Pflanze bevorzugt Magerrasen und Moorwiesen.

In this upload, I attempted to use ancient Greek cyclical tuning to TRY and achieve \"Just Tuning\"...with not very good results! I couldn't get the 3rds to sound \"right\" :o(\n\nThere are two Delphic Hymns that have been discovered, and they were dedicated to the god Apollo. Unlike the famous \"Song of Seikilos\" (the first COMPLETE piece of music that has been so far found to have survived from antiquity), the two Delphic Hymns have sadly not survived in their complete form. However, they do survive in substantial fragments...giving just a tantilizing taste of the glory of the tragically lost, magnificant musical culture of ancient Greece! \n\nThe two Delphic Hymns are dated c.138 BC and 128 BC. My rendition here, is of the earlier of them; the First Delphic Hymn. Although it has unfortunately not survived in its complete form, the First Delphic Hymn to Apollo is THE earliest unambiguous surviving fragment of notated music from ANYWHERE in the Western World! It is written in the ALPHABETICAL musical notation system used in ancient Greece, whereby alphabetical notation describing the pitch of the melody, is written above the text of the song, as can be clearly seen in this image of the actual Delphic Hymn, as it was found, inscribed in marble:\n\nhttp://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Delphic_Hymns\n\nThe rhythm can easily be inferred from the syllables of the text.\n\nThe First Delphic Hymn to Apollo was discovered in 1893 by a French archaeologist. It was inscribed in marble, carved on an outside wall of the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi.\n\nAll that is known about its composer is that it was written by an Athenian, around 138 BC, since the part of the inscription giving the name of the composer is too difficult to read. The Second Delphic Hymn is slightly more recent, and has been dated to precisely 128 BC; evidently it was first performed in the same year. The name of the composer of the Second Delphic Hymn has also survived, in a separate inscription: he is called \"Limenius\". The occasion of the later hymn was the Pythian Festival, and this one, the earlier hymn, was probably written for the boys choir at the Pythian Games in 138 BC.\n\nThe translation of the fragment of text which has survived of the this, the First Delphic Hymn to Apollo, is as follows:\n\n\"Hear me, you who posses deep-wooded Helicon,\nfair-armed daughters of Zeus the magnificent!\nFly to beguile with your accents your brother,\ngolden-tressed Phoebus who, on the twin peak of this rock of Parnassus,\nescorted by illustrius maidens of Delphi,\nsets out for the limpid strams of Castalia, traversing,\non the Delphic promontory, the prophetic pinnacle.\nBehold glorious Attica, nation of the great city which,\nthanks to the prayers of the Tritonid warrior,\noccupies a hillside sheltered from all harm.\nOn the holy alters Hephaestos cosumes the thighs of young bullocks,\nmingled with the flames, the Arabian vapor rises towards Olympos.\nThe shrill rustling lotus murmurs its swelling song, and the golden kithara,\nthe sweet-sounding kithara, answers the voice of men.\nAnd all the host of poets, dwellers in Attica, sing your glory, God,\nfamed for playing the kithara, son of great Zeus,\nbeside this snow-crowned peak, oh you who reveal to all mortals\nthe eternal and infallible oracles.\nThey sing how you conquered the prophetic tripod\nguarded by a fierce dragon when, with your darts\nyou pierced the gaudy, tortuously coiling monster,\nso that, uttering many fearful hisses, the beast expired.\nThey sing too, . . . .\"\n\nAll of my 9 albums of mystical, ancient lyre music are now available from iTunes...\n\n1)\"An Ancient Lyre\": http://bit.ly/dhCozi\n\n2)\"King David's Lyre; Echoes of Ancient Israel\": \nhttp://bit.ly/9PCIua\n                          \n3)\"The Ancient Biblical Lyre\": http://bit.ly/9hTDje\n\n4)\"Lyre of the Levites\": http://bit.ly/9baWuM\n\n5)\"Apollo's Lyre\": http://bit.ly/dhCozi\n\n6)\"Ancient Times -- Music of The Ancient World\": \n     http://bit.ly/aRF5PD\n\n7)\"The Ancient Greek Modes\": http://bit.ly/cZks0o\n\n8)\"The Ancient Greek Lyre\": http://bit.ly/bxO7Ra\n\n9)\"Ancient Visions -- New Compositions for an Ancient Lyre\": http://bit.ly/dCPmRN\n\nPhysical CDs are also available anywhere in the world from CD Baby, for 3 of my best selling albums:\n\n\"An Ancient Lyre\": http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mlevy4\n\n\"King David's Lyre; Echoes of Ancient Israel\": \nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mlevy\n\n\"Lyre of the Levites\": http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mlevy2\n\nFor full details about my albums of lyre music, and the fascinating ancient historical background, please visit my official website:\n\nhttp://www.ancientlyre.com", "title": "Ancient Greek Music - \"First Delphic Hymn to Apollo\"c.138BC", "publishedDate": "2007-11-30T15:10:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "3MMUP86wL9Y", "description": "Mhonividente dio una prediccion para el programa de La Voz Mexico\ny anuncio una proxima desgracia en ese programa \nTwitter @Mhonividente Facebook Mhonividente", "title": "Mhonividente ve desgracia en la Voz Mexico Julion Alvarez reacciona 9/2/2014", "publishedDate": "2014-09-02T19:52:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "3MMm7MJVM-I", "description": "", "title": "Importance of the wild medicine Horsetail", "publishedDate": "2014-06-11T02:09:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "3MNLZg9R1xI", "description": "Nike's overview", "title": "Nike Sustainability Strategy", "publishedDate": "2010-12-06T15:58:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3MNYruNnBzc", "description": "Get ready for extreme jet dogfights in the new fighter game Ace Combat Assault Horizon.

Commonly known as Titan Arum or the \"corpse flower,\" it is a large, fast-growing plant in the Aroid family. Few of these plants exist in cultivation, and they bloom only rarely and under just the right conditions. Of the plants in cultivation, less than 130 flowerings have been documented in the world in nearly 120 years. On the extremely infrequent occasion that a Titan Arum comes into flower, the intense, foul odor, emitted from a tall spike of small, crowded flowers, lasts just a few days.\n\nEvery year or two, the plant sends up one long, gigantic, rolled-up leaf that unfurls its umbrella-like blade during a period of about three weeks. The leaf lives for one or two years before the plant goes into a dormant period that lasts from a few months to a year. The inflorescence, a giant flowering structure opens quickly, often in just a couple of hours. It maintains its full form for about three to five days, with peak bloom (and the awful odor) lasting about 24 hours.\n\nThe full bloom process documented here lasted approximately 15 days, with the plant entering peak bloom on the afternoon of May 19, 2012 and then starting to recede by the following morning.\n\nLearn more at http://www.mobot.org/titanarum", "title": "Titan Arum (Corpse Flower) Time Lapse", "publishedDate": "2012-05-31T20:20:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "3MZznZWy15U", "description": "Pavlov - Paley, RUS | 2014 GS LAT R3 R\n\nWorld DanceSport Federation\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/J1Q1Wy\n\nNikita Pavlov and Daria Paley, RUS, dance the Rumba in the third round of the 2014 Grand Slam Latin Moscow on 26 October.   \n\nFACEBOOK: wdsfisdancesporttotal \nTWITTER: @dancesporttotal \nINSTAGRAM: #wdsfdancesport\nGOOGLE +: World DanceSport Federation\nwww.worlddancesport.org", "title": "Pavlov - Paley, RUS | 2014 GS LAT R3 R | DanceSport Total", "publishedDate": "2014-10-26T15:56:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "3M_DT7GdQPI", "description": "Little Donkey", "title": "Little Donkey", "publishedDate": "2009-04-29T15:46:13.000Z"}, {"_id": "3M_JbZWfTi4", "description": "Men, I have found the solution to your issue.

After traditional music lessons in his youth, Sam discovered the great variety of the electronic music scene, which he became acquainted with.\nIn 2011 he started to produce his own compositions, by using selfmade sounds along with edited samples. The self-taught artist deconstructs the traditional structure of music and transforms his samples into a detailed electronic sound.

Bahkan, diperkirakan kuota BBM bersubsidi akan terus melonjak dari 46 juta kiloliter (KL) menjadi 48 juta KL.\n\nWakil Menteri Keuangan Anny Ratnawati mengatakan, meskipun pemerintah berencana menaikkan harga BBM bersubsidi untuk mobil pribadi, kuota BBM bersubsidi tetap akan jebol dari 46 juta kiloliter menjadi 48 juta kiloliter.\n\nAnny menambahkan, kebijakan penghematan BBM bersubsidi dengan menaikkan harga BBM untuk mobil pribadi menjadi Rp6.500 per liter bukan untuk menghemat anggaran subsidi BBM. Sebab, kebijakan itu hanya untuk menurunkan beban subsidi agar lebih kecil dari sebelumnya.\n\nSaat ini, anggaran subsidi energi mencapai lebih dari Rp300 triliun, termasuk di dalamnya anggaran subsidi untuk BBM yang mencapai lebih dari Rp220 triliun. Dengan rencana penaikan harga BBM, diperkirakan akan sedikit menekan anggaran subsidi minyak. (Qudsiah/Jen Anwar)\n\n\nHanya Sekedar Memberikan Informasi Video Berita, Mohon di Like atau di Share.

However, it has come to characterize the style of secular music played by Ashkenazi Jews for joyful celebrations such as weddings.\nWhat Does Klezmer Music Sound Like?:\nKlezmer music is intended to replicate the human voice, including sounds of crying, wailing and laughing. It is generally the violin's job to do this imitation. Often, a klezmer band will include a fiddle, a bass or cello, a clarinet and a drum. Secondary instruments include hammered dulcimers and accordion.\n\n\u00a9 2013 Shiloh Worship Music COPY FREELY;This Music is copyrighted to prevent misuse, however,permission is granted for non-commercial copying-Radio play permitted\u00a0 www.shilohworshipmusic.com\n\n\u7948\u308b\u65e5\u672c Christian songs \u6d25\u6ce2 Jesus ccm worship praise \u656c\u62dc\u8d5e\u7f8e \u8036\u7a23\u57fa\u7763 \u0418\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0441 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 Christus Lob Musik \u092f\u0940\u0936\u0941 \u092e\u0938\u0940\u0939 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0942\u091c\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0936\u0902\u0938\u093e \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u092f\u0928 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0924 musique chr\u00e9tien\n\nCOPY FREELY \u00a92012 Shiloh Worship Music-This Music is copyrighted to prevent misuse, however,permission is granted for non-commercial copying only. \nwww.shilohworshipmusic.com\n\nFREE PRAISE & WORSHIP @ the iTunes Store\n Podcast Description\n FREE Original Praise and Worship Music Our style is very eclectic ranging from Blues to Folk to Reggae to Worldbeat to Bluegrass to Rock-n-Roll.

Cover the container with taut plastic wrap. Take your paring knife and pierce 4 small holes on the top of the plastic wrap. Leave it out overnight. Take off the old plastic wrap the next day since they may have laid eggs on it. Replace it with a new sheet of plastic wrap and pierce 4 small holes again (Repeat for 2-3 days). If you notice a few are flying out, put a second layer of plastic wrap or make sure your holes aren't too big.

There are a lot of limitations in terms of financing them, and most people think you can assign the financing with the purchase. You cannot. This video explains the concepts.\n\nTRNASCRIPTION:\n\nHey everybody, it's Rowan Smith from the Mortgage Centre. I want to talk today about assignments: what assigning a contract means, what your obligations are as the assignee and the assignor.\n\nNow, I want to define what an assignment is. Let's say you purchased a place, or you wrote a contract on a place to buy a home. Maybe the completion date is April 15th or something like that and it is January 13th today. Now, you go and you take time and you arrange your financing, you get everything in place, you remove subjects, you get all of that done and then what happens? You get transferred in your job. You can't back out of that contract at that point. You have entered into it. It's binding. You've removed subjects. You still have to complete even though you're being transferred to another province. You can either rent the place out or you can try and sell it on assignment.\n\nNow, what that means is that you're going to try and sell the rights to that contract. A lot of people used to use these to make money in the late 90's and early 2000 and onwards. The way they would do it is they would buy a pre-sale. So, maybe the place is going built in, you know, 2 years down the road, and the person would write the contract today. They would get into it with a small deposit, and then they would go and they would have to wait two years until the property would be completed. Now, during that time, of course the market was rising and rising and rising. By the time they had to complete they had only had to put a very small percentage down.\n\nSo, their options were to complete and buy the place for that value, or their option was to sell it on assignment and ask for some \"lift.\" Lift is the value that has resulted from the market prices rising when you contracted to buy the place here (gestures low) and the developer is stuck with your price here, and then two years later, you are selling it for this amount (gestures much higher) before you actually complete. So, someone is buying that contract from you and if the value of the home has gone up $100,000 you could get $100,000 up front based on selling your assignment.\n\nHowever, some banks don't allow assignments. So when it comes to financing, you have got to be careful. The other thing is, going back to my example of a home that is going to close in April, if you were to sell that home chances are there isn't going to be a material difference in the value of the home at the end of only a couple of months. So you'd be lucky to get your actual purchase price. If you were buying it for, say, $400,000 you would probably only get (I'm grabbing numbers out of the air here) $390,000 or $385,000. Something like that (this is because you are being forced to sell quickly due to the transfer). So, you may still be out money.\n\nIf you are fortunate, someone will buy the contract off you for the same amount that you were going to be paying for it. Therefore it would be a wash. Rarely does life work out that well, however. So, I've had some inquiries on assignments and a couple of things have come up that have lead me to see there are some misunderstandings regarding these topics.\n\nWhen you do an assignment, when you try and sell the contract, you are not selling your financing. So if you have gone and arranged a mortgage and it is totally done, and you are completely approved to buy a home - you are completely approved to buy THIS home on THIS date for THIS price - you turn around because you got transferred and I want to sell the right to buy that home to somebody and just try and break even and get my money back, I CAN DO SO.\n\nThat person (the buyer of the contract on assignment) has to arrange their own financing, and how they do so is entirely up to them. They may not even need financing. Maybe they are a cash buyer and are going to pay for the contract outright.\n\nThe important lesson here is that you cannot assign your financing prior to completion. You're only assigning the contract, so it's very important to make that distinction.\n\nThanks again for watching!", "title": "Assignments - What is a Contract Assignment?", "publishedDate": "2010-01-14T07:55:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N-mFHmznsc", "description": "", "title": "Real Steel - Midas vs Biowar", "publishedDate": "2014-02-21T15:48:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N01v-VCpYw", "description": "For more, visit http://failblog.org/", "title": "Breathalyzer Fail", "publishedDate": "2013-07-16T23:40:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N0AC8gUUPw", "description": "New toyota MARK-X movie Ver.\u2161\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u21d2\u21d2http://youtu.be/jin5O4Wj374 \n\n\uff2d'\uff5a \uff33\uff30\uff25\uff25\uff24\u306e\u30bb\u30c0\u30f3\u5c02\u7528\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\"Prussian Blue\uff0f\u30d7\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\"\u306eB\uff4f\uff44\uff59\uff2b\uff49\uff54\u3068\u3001\uff2d'\uff5a \uff33\uff30\uff25\uff25\uff24 \"\uff2a\uff55\uff4c\uff49\uff41 \uff26\uff55\uff4c\uff4c\uff54\uff48\uff52\uff4f\uff54\uff54\uff4c\uff45 20\uff49\uff4e\uff43\"\u3000\"\uff2a\uff55\uff4e\uff4f \uff32\uff49\uff53\uff49\uff4e\uff47 20\uff49\uff4e\uff43\"\u3000\"\uff2a\uff55\uff4e\uff4f \uff22\uff41\uff42\uff45\uff4c \uff12\uff10\uff49\uff4e\uff43\"\u30a2\u30eb\u30df\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u3057\u305f\u3001\u7d14\u6b63\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u8eca\u306e\u300e\uff27'\uff53\u300f\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\uff34\uff2f\uff39\uff2f\uff34\uff21\u3000\uff11\uff13\uff10\u7cfb\uff2d\uff21\uff32\uff2b \uff38\uff08\u30a8\u30e0\u30ba\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9 \u30d7\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf \u65b0\u578b \uff11\uff13\uff10\u7cfb\u30de\u30fc\u30af\uff38\uff09\uff29\uff4d\uff41\uff47\uff45 \uff4d\uff4f\uff56\uff49\uff45\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\n\u3010\uff21\uff4c\uff55\uff4d\uff49\uff4e\uff55\uff4d\uff37\uff48\uff45\uff45\uff4c  \uff37\uff45\uff42\uff53\uff49\uff54\uff45\u3011 \n\u30fb\uff2a\uff55\uff4c\uff49\uff41 \uff26\uff55\uff4c\uff4c\uff54\uff48\uff52\uff4f\uff54\uff54\uff4c\uff45\uff0fhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/products/wheel/julia-fullthrottle/\n\u30fb\uff2a\uff55\uff4e\uff4f \uff32\uff49\uff53\uff49\uff4e\uff47\uff0fhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/products/wheel/juno-rising/\n\u30fb\uff2a\uff55\uff4e\uff4f \uff22\uff41\uff42\uff45\uff4c \uff0fhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/products/wheel/\n\n\u3010\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed \uff28\uff30\u3011\nhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/products/body-kit/detail/?CID=212\n\n\u3010\u65b0\u8eca\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u3054\u8cfc\u5165\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\u3011\nhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/complete_car/\n\n\u3010Product Inquiry Form\u3011\nhttp://www.mzspeed.com/en/inquiry.asp\n\n\u3010Details of the home page body kit is here\u3011\nhttp://www.mzspeed.co.jp/?lang=En\n\n\u3010\u5546\u54c1\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b\u5148\u3011\n\u30a8\u30e0\u30ba\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\uff0f\uff2d'\uff5a \uff33\uff30\uff25\uff25\uff24\n\u3012578-0966\u3000\n\u5927\u962a\u5e9c\u6771\u5927\u962a\u5e02\u4e09\u5cf6\uff13\uff0d\uff18\uff0d\uff17\n\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u4e8b\u696d\u90e8 (\u696d\u8005\u69d8\u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b)\uff1aTEL. 06 (6748) 2603\n\u65b0\u8eca\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u4e8b\u696d\u90e8 (\u304a\u8eca\u3054\u8cfc\u5165\u30fb\u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b)\uff1aTEL. 06 (6748) 2602\n\u30a8\u30e0\u30ba \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9 \u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7 (\u30d1\u30fc\u30c4\u306e\u3054\u8cfc\u5165\u30fb\u304a\u53d6\u4ed8\u3051)\uff1aTEL. 06 (6747) 2700\n\n\u3010Inquiries from overseas here\u3011\n3-8-7,Mishima, Higashiosaka, Osaka, 578-0966,Japan \nTEL. +81-6-6748-2603 \nFAX. +81-6-6748-2605\nEmail: office@mzspeed.co.jp", "title": "\u201c TOYOTA 130 MARK-X\u201d Prussian Blue\u3000bodykit\uff5c\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf \u65b0\u578b130\u30de\u30fc\u30af\uff38\u3000\u30a8\u30e0\u30ba\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9 \u30a8\u30a2\u30ed", "publishedDate": "2013-11-25T13:19:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N0g0fbDKTw", "description": "http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/bryan-fischer-suggests-native-americans-were-justifiably-removed-their-land\nRight Wing Watch reports on the extreme rhetoric and activities of key right-wing figures and organizations by showing their views in their own words.

He also offers tips for what patients can do to prevent shock loss and to help their surgeon on transplant day. \n\nAlthough rare, post-surgical hair loss, also referred to as shock loss, can arise from two etiologies: accelerated hair loss and post-surgical effluvium. It is logical that attendant with surgery there may be an increased incidence of hair loss after surgery. After all, there is an increase in blood flow to the surgical site post procedure. That is why the recipient area is red or erythematous after surgery. This bathes the area with DHT along with the necessary oxygen and nutrients required for healing and life of the tissue. This however, technically is not post-surgical shock loss, but accelerated hair loss. The risk of this occurring is dependent on the genetic predisposition of the hair in the recipient area and the extend of miniaturization of these hairs.\n\nWhat then is post-surgical shock loss or effluvium? This type of post-surgery hair loss can result after the procedure and arises from trauma to the miniaturized hair. It usually manifests about 3 months post procedure. This trauma to the weaken hair in the recipient area occurs when the angling of the sites is off. It is imperative that the angle and direction of hair growth be fallowed accurately.\n\nSignificant post-surgical hair loss in the post-surgical period is at best a rare event; in fact, I have not seen it for the last 4-5 years. The reasons are related to advances in surgical techniques and pharmacologic therapies. First and foremost is the creation of precise angles of the recipient sites, while fallowing the exact direction of hair growth. Secondly, the use of very small needles and cut to size blades, that minimize the size of the sites created, hence the extent of tissue and possible follicular injury if there is native hair remaining. Lastly, the use of finesteride diminishes the DHT by 70% hence protecting the native and transplanted hair from any post-surgical increase in circulating DHT. The use of minoxidil 5% acts synergistically to further protect the native miniaturized hair and possibly stimulate the growth of the transplanted hair. Furthermore, the growth of the transplanted hair with its increased caliber is of greater contribution to the hair mass and volume than the native thinner caliber miniaturized hairs. I do recall one patient about 6 years ago that had some shock loss post-surgically. He was managed with finesteride, minoxidil 5%, reassurance and time. He of course not only recovered but also had an outstanding hair restoration outcome. The patient got his smile back in about four months post-procedure as his hair transplant commenced to grow in.", "title": "Dr. Bernard Arocha Discuss Shock Loss", "publishedDate": "2014-07-22T19:17:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N2e03OV9xY", "description": "Yesterday is Indonesian's Independence Day!\nI've been away for three days and I already miss my homeland.\niMovie was giving me a lot of crap that I couldn't post yesterday, I couldn't even export a video longer than 4 minutes.

Skimmers from far and wide will gather in Vail to test their buoyancy on Lake Golden Peak for the chance at the title of 2014 World Pond Skimming Champion and the grand prize -- an Epic Pass for the 2014-2015 season, a pair of Liberty Skis, and a Helly Hansen base layer.\n \nThe closing day tradition of donning costumes and skimming across icy water at the legendary World Pond Skimming Championships holds strong as 75 participants will careen themselves off a snow jump in the hopes of coming out on the other side on Sunday, April 20. The spectacle defies the laws of physics and common sense as a panel of highly-skilled judges scores each competitor on distance, style, creativity and water resistance. The contest gets underway at 3 p.m. and the Golden Peak venue opens at 1:30 p.m. for sponsor expos and giveaways. The top male and female competitors will each be awarded the grand prize.\n \nRegistration for this year's World Pond Skimming Championships presented by Red Bull opens Saturday, March 15 at www.vail.com/springback and costs $75 per competitor. The field is limited to 75 participants ages 14 and older on a first-come, first-served basis. Each competitor will also receive a complimentary Helly Hansen HH Dry Baselayer to keep warm and dry following their Pond Skimming run.  Entries for this outrageous event sell out quickly each year, so those interested in participating are encouraged to register promptly. Registration to participate must be completed online prior to the event; no on-site registration will be available.\n \nThe World Pond Skimming Championships presented by Red Bull is a long-standing closing day tradition on Vail Mountain and is a well-loved part of the lineup of entertainment at Spring Back to Vail, the yearly festival to celebrate the conclusion of the skiing and riding season in Vail. It is guaranteed to be a wet, wild and wacky good time for participants and spectators alike. The schedule of entertainment for closing day on April 20 also includes a free concert from Steel Pulse at Solaris in Vail Village at 4 p.m.\n \nFor more information on the World Pond Skimming Championships presented by Red Bull, including rules and judging criteria, as well as the full Spring Back to Vail schedule visit www.vail.com/springback.", "title": "Vail, World Pond Skimming Championships - Presented by Red Bull", "publishedDate": "2014-05-06T22:23:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N4E2KCaRZg", "description": "Chantal Mathieu chante Gribouille; chanteuse, auteure; Lyonnaise, disparue en plein ascension en 1968 \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 27 ans.", "title": "Grenoble 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-05-27T19:13:30.000Z"}, {"_id": "3N4NdXAYOEQ", "description": "I must confess that I'm not the biggest Pokemon fan, but I did play the crap out of my copy of Red Version circa 1998.

I just wish I'd had more time to practice it.\n\nI feel like I'm finally starting to make some progress as a guitarist.  It's funny; I've been playing guitar for over twelve years, but only learned my first official scales a few months ago.  Haha, I only recently learned how to hold a guitar pick correctly as well.  I have good dexterity built up, but still need to work on the knowledge/application of guitar technique.  My rhythm is still pretty terrible too... \n\nI had some issues with the guitar that I used.  That thing is jacked up, haha.  It's actually my favorite electric guitar to play, but it REALLY hates to stay in tune.  It's also got some electrical issues that screw up the tone.  Perhaps I should have just used my SG, but I thought that the Rocket really fit the style of this cover.\n\nI'm going to be busy with work as summer gets approaches, but I think I can guarantee at least 2 videos a month, one of which being a cover with lyrics.

Machlis, Scott Rudin, Fred Schepisi\nScreenwriter: Andy Breckman, Michael Leeson\nFilm Description: Legendary scientist Albert Einstein (played here by Walter Matthau) takes a break from theoretical physics to try to set up his intellectual niece with a handsome auto mechanic in this romantic comedy. The movie's central conceit is that Einstein's brilliance extends to matters of the heart, allowing him to immediately sense that Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), a bright, lower-class mechanic obsessed with Popular Science Magazine, would be perfect for his niece Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Catherine is already engaged to a stiff Princeton man. In order to defeat Catherine's resistance, Uncle Albert decides to help Ed pretend to be a revolutionary scientist, a charade that inevitably leads to much farcical confusion. Einstein's scientist pals are portrayed as a Greek chorus of Catskills-style kibitzers, featuring such notable perfomers as Lou Jacobi as Kurt Godel and director Gene Saks as Boris Podolsky.\n\ni.q.,\"i.q. clip\",\"i.q. trailer\",\"i.q. movie part 1\",\"tim robbins\",\"walter matthau\",\"stephen fry\",\"wrist watch videos\",\"romantic comedies\",\"romantic dramas\",\"20th century period pieces\",comedy,drama,romance,\"scott rudin\",\"neil a machlis\",\"fred schepisi\",\"carol baum\",\"sandy gallin\",\"attraction videos\",\"helping videos\",\"madness videos\",\"science videos\",\"college videos\",\"laboratory videos\",\"ed walters\",\"albert einstein\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++133563,/m/0h0yt,/m/0gyy0,/m/01nr36", "title": "I.Q.
