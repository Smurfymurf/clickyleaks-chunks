'Give me all your money before I shoot you.\" Ocampo said. \n\nBishop reached into his pocket to retrieve his money, and discretely unbuckled the holster of his own gun. But Bishop only had $60 to $70 dollars on him, which enraged Ocampo. He continued to threaten Bishop, \"I'll shoot you!\"\n\nOcampo ordered Bishop out of the car, then got in the driver's seat himself, and reached across to unlock the passenger door for his cousin, giving Bishop an opportunity. Bishop ran to the back of the car while Ocampo was distracted, and drew his pistol.  Ocampo tried to shoot Bishop but his gun jammed, allowing Bishop to fire four shots.\n\nThe teen was hit in the chest and head, but Ocampo still managed to run 150 feet, before he collapsed, dead. Ocampo's accomplice, his cousin, was  tracked down by officers within hours and arrested. Ocampo's parents are in disbelief and told ABC 7 news their son couldn't have been a carjacker because he was supposed to be at work.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Jamison Crowder's Electrifying Punt Return TD | ACC Must See Moment", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T20:45:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-tK1PV_RZ3I", "description": "Buy here: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/stem-citrus-fruit-sprayer.cfm?adid=youtube\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/vat19com\n\nHundreds more curiously awesome products at:\nhttp://www.vat19.com/?adid=youtube\n\n*******************\nWith the Stem Citrus Fruit Sprayer, you can spray juice directly from your favorite fruits in the freshest and easiest way.\n\nSimply insert the Stem directly into the fruit and then pump the nozzle to evenly spritz your favorite foods with fresh citrus juice.\n\nOutfitted with serrated teeth, inserting the Stem Fruit Juice Sprayer directly into your lemons, limes, and oranges couldn't be easier.\n\nWhen finished, unscrew the bottom of the Stem Citrus Sprayer for easy cleaning in the sink. \n\n\n**********************\n\nTo check out the latest curiously awesome products from Vat19.com, click here: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/showproducts.cfm?action=new&adid=youtube \n\nFor the most popular items on Vat19, click here: http://www.vat19.com/dvds/showproducts.cfm?action=popular&adid=youtube", "title": "Stem Citrus Fruit Sprayer", "publishedDate": "2012-06-29T11:47:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "-tK3PDddIvI", "description": "\u5999\u84ee\nMurine Plus", "title": "1984 -

He serves among the great and appears before rulers; he travels in foreign lands and learns what is good and evil in the human lot. He sets his heart to rise early to seek the Lord who made him, and to petition the Most High; he opens his mouth in prayer and asks pardon for his sins. If the great Lord is willing, he will be filled with the spirit of understanding; he will pour forth words of wisdom of his own and give thanks to the Lord in prayer. The Lord will direct his counsel and knowledge, as he meditates on his mysteries. He will show the wisdom of what he has learned, and will glory in the law of the Lord's covenant.

Because you have an increased risk of developing the cancer.\n\nSo, the way we recommend doing the examination is pick a time when we know\nthat the testicles are going to be descended within the scrotum. The best\ntime is when it's warm and in the shower. When you're taking a warm shower,\nthe testicles often descend down into the scrotum making them easier to\nfeel.\n\nThe examination requires palpation or what we call feeling the testicle.\nYou want to roll the testicle between your fingers in the shower when it's\neasy to feel the whole testicle. The testicle should feel soft and squishy\nall throughout.\n\nThe testicle has several parts. There's the testicle. There's an area on\ntop of the testicle called the epididymus. Sometimes if people don't know\nwhat they're feeling, the epididymus can feel like a little nodule or a\nmass. It really isn't. It's a normal part of the testicle.\n\nThere can be conditions within the epididymus. You can feel little lumps or\nmasses in the epididymus which is on top of the testicle. Often we see\npatients who are concerned that that may represent a cancerous area. And\nbottom line, if you're not sure, if you feel something that you think is\nabnormal, you should be evaluated.\n\nHowever, when you're doing the examination, feel the testicle. The testicle\nshould feel soft and squishy. It should not have any firm areas. There\nshould be no masses. A testicular tumor would feel like a firm, hard mass\nin either a part of the testicle or sometimes involving the entire\ntesticle.\n\nHowever, again, if you're not sure, you're concerned, and you feel there\nmay be a possibility of some abnormality, it never hurts to get checked out\nby your primary care physician or your local urologist.", "title": "How to Do a Testicular Cancer Self-Exam | Testicular Cancer", "publishedDate": "2013-08-15T09:21:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-tTLJamlTvI", "description": "This is some footage of a 120lb carp I caught at Gillhams fishery in South Thailand in March 2009.

While living - Lawson had many imitators - but no peers - with his death we turned a page to which there can be no additions.\n\nHenry Lawson (17 June 1867 -- 2 September 1922) was an Australian writer and poet. Along with his contemporary Banjo Paterson, Lawson is among the best-known Australian poets and fiction writers of the colonial period and is often called Australia's \"greatest writer\". He was the son of the poet, publisher and feminist Louisa Lawson.\n\nA Song of General Sick and Tiredness \nHenry Lawson, 1908\n(Different Version to the one published in the book I'm holding)\n\nI'm tired of raving at wrong things which must still to the end endure; \nI'm sick and tired of the selfish rich, and I'm tired of the selfish poor. \nOf the Awful Wrongs of the Social Plan (both sides, and in between) \u2014 \nI'm tired of The Bulletin's own Fat Man, and I'm also tired of the Lean. \n\n'Tis a weariness born of twenty years of 'rastlin' with Truth and Lies, \nAnd of writing on rum and blood-stained tears, that the People might Wake and Rise! \nI am wild, Damned Wild, at the wages paid for fighting with Freedom's Foes, \nAnd the awful blunders the people made when at last they Woke and Rose. \n\nThe motor car is the Car of Greed, and I've often written it down \n(With little effect I fear, indeed, for I notice it still in town); \nBut now I'm tired of the Goggled Hog, and his veiled contemptuous \"dart\". \nI am also weary of Boko Bill and his fruit and Bottle-O cart. \n\nI'm weary of Clara Vere de Vere, and her Bloque at the grand hotel, \nAnd the Orphan Girl and the Orphan Boy \u2014 and their mother and father as well. \nIt's not their fault, for extremes are fate (and extremes will meet again) \u2014 \nI'm also disgusted with One-eyed Kate and her Bloke in Red Rock Lane. \n\nMy soul is sad for the young bards here who rave of a wrong red-hot, \nAnd care not a curse, so they get their beer, if the people starve or not. \nWith a fine contempt for the grave and the tomb, for the old books on the shelves, \nThey gibe and sneer at the old bard's gloom \u2014 and they straightway weep themselves. \n\nI'm tired of the cruel, bleeding welt on the Young Heart Tempest-Tost; \nLikewise of the love that we never felt, and the friend that we never lost. \nI'm tired of the long white limbs, small head, and the eyes of unearthly hue; \nOf the Bride, Rose Red, in her Bridal Bed \u2014 and I'm sick of the Other Man, too. \n\nI'm tired \u2014 O I'm tired \u2014 of the bleeding heart of the bride that never was wed; \nAnd the Dagger Drave \u2014 and the blood-stained grave of the lover who never was dead; \nOf the wronged young wife, and her blighted life; also of the locket worn \nWith the Golden Curl from the Head of the Girl of the Babe that never was born. \n\nTo resume: \nI'm scared of the great strong arms and the breast, and the brute force under control; \nOf the gloomy eyes, and the head, and the rest \u2014 and the hidden heart and soul \u2014 \nOf the muscle and tan of the awful MAN that our girl bards rave about; \nThe first of his kind since the world began \u2014 and I want them to trot him out. \n\nOf the Swooning Love, 'neath the stars (above), and the Slumbrous Burning Eyes; \nOf the Blarst of Skorn from our Bards of Morn, and our girl-bards' DAMN likewise. \n(And let it be said, ere we go to bed, lest you curse me needlessly, \nThat I do not moan for these things alone, for I'm also tired of ME.) \n\nAnd now to conclude: \nI'm tired of the sneering at friendship, too, for you'll find in the end, no doubt, \nWhen you get run in, and the world looks blue, there'll be one to bail you out \u2014 \nI'm tired of the Love of the Bygone Day, of Women and Dice and Wine \u2014 \nYou'll find, when his Washup has said his say, 'tis the Missus that pays the fine. \n\nYou may shriek to High Heaven of love and death and howl of a Soul in Pain, \nYou may curse the Gods with your latest breath till the cows come home again; \nBut Dad plods home from his work to-night \u2014 in his bosom a peace profound \u2014 \nTo his bustling wife and his kitchen bright, and he helps the world go round. \n\nYou may write of revolvers, and nerves of steel, and the eyes of a steel-blue grey, \nOf the white man banned, with his life in his hand, in those Islands far away; \nOf his panther limbs and his courage grand, and his deadly aim and true \u2014 \nBut Bill and Jim with perception dim would call him a Jackaroo. \n\nYou may rave and rave of your fancy loves that go by your fancy names, \nBut the bread you eat and the bills you meet are fixed by Lizzie and James. \nYou may ode your Gladyses and what not \u2014 at the rest let your scorn be hurled, \nBut Lucy, and Mary, and Jack, and Fred \u2014 O! they are the living world. \n\n\nThe Bulletin, 10 December 1908, page 26 (Two verses didn't fit in this video description)", "title": "Henry Lawson Poem - Song of General Sick-and-Tiredness - Poetical Works Reading", "publishedDate": "2013-06-10T12:24:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "-te-Fg4itK4", "description": "Paucity // Cut Com\n\nHis channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/tylerinpaucity", "title": "Paucity // Cut Com", "publishedDate": "2014-10-10T19:57:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "-teIhOW29-Q", "description": "5/2/14: Rays manager Joe Maddon is ejected in the 13th inning after disputing the challenge ruling at first base\n\nCheck out http://m.mlb.com/video for our full archive of videos, and subscribe on YouTube for the best, exclusive MLB content: http://youtube.com/MLB   \n \nAbout MLB.com:\nCommissioner Allan H.

These brains in jars jiggle just like real brains but taste delicious! These would be perfect for a Halloween or zombie themed party. And why stop with brains? Shape the dough into any kind of organ or specimen and make your own little edible laboratory! Just make sure that the jars you use are about double the size of the strawberries, because the dough will make them much bigger. I made this mistake while I was filming, and am very lucky that I have a dollar store in my building that I could run down to and pick up some bigger jars. \n\nCheck out more science recipes at our Recipe Science Fair here | \u30b3\u30e9\u30dc\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3078: http://bit.ly/1l5fxay\n\nRecipe: http://wp.me/p3pkDW-4Q\n\n\u30ec\u30b7\u30d4\uff1a http://wp.me/p3pkDW-4Q\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/pankobunnycooking\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pankobunny\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/pankobunny\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/pankobunny\nBlog: http://pankobunny.wordpress.com\n\nAs always, thank you!!\n\u3044\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\nxx\nCayla\n\nFor you all who have read this far, here is a clue for next week's video: jelly, beer\n\nMusic courtesy of Audio Network. \nSong: Evening Stroll\n\nThis is not a sponsored video.", "title": "How to Make an Edible Brain | \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b\u8133\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9", "publishedDate": "2014-06-23T12:41:58.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ttRkFRokAU", "description": "I let my giant leopard gecko outside sometimes to get exercise but only on hot days in the shade.\nGoogle+ Me and say Hello- https://plus.google.com/u/0/111359005372666399623", "title": "Giant Leopard Gecko Out For Some Exercise", "publishedDate": "2012-09-02T18:52:37.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ttXgJu7KRw", "description": "", "title": "Formosan Subterranean Termite (in the Kale root) - \u0422\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044b [Coptotermes formosanus] |NC|", "publishedDate": "2014-09-04T02:55:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-tt_DncXSn0", "description": "Eldridge Cleaver (1935-1998) was writer, radical intellectual, Black liberation theorist and Minister of Information of the Black Panther Party(1967-1971).

Harris, David Lean, Jim Painten\nScreenwriter: Robert Bolt, T.E. Lawrence\nFilm Description: This sweeping, highly literate historical epic covers the Allies' mideastern campaign during World War I as seen through the eyes of the enigmatic T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, in the role that made him a star). After a prologue showing us Lawrence's ultimate fate, we flash back to Cairo in 1917. A bored general staffer, Lawrence talks his way into a transfer to Arabia. Once in the desert, he befriends Sherif Ali Ben El Kharish (Omar Sharif, making one of the most spectacular entrances in movie history) and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrence's motives in this matter: Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) dismisses him as yet another \"desert-loving Englishman,\" and his British superiors assume that he's either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). After successfully completing his mission, Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies, as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden (Claude Rains), who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa, Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer). In the heat of the next battle, a wild-eyed Lawrence screams \"No prisoners!\" and fights more ruthlessly than ever. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson used T. E. Lawrence's own self-published memoir The Seven Pillars of Wisdom as their principal source, although some of the characters are composites, and many of the \"historical\" incidents are of unconfirmed origin. Two years in the making (you can see O'Toole's weight fluctuate from scene to scene), the movie, lensed in Spain and Jordan, ended up costing a then-staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The 1962 Royal Premiere in London was virtually the last time that David Lean's director's cut was seen: 20 minutes were edited from the film's general release, and 15 more from the 1971 reissue. This abbreviated version was all that was available for public exhibition until a massive 1989 restoration, at 216 minutes that returned several of Lean's favorite scenes while removing others with which he had never been satisfied.\n\n\"lawrence of arabia\",\"lawrence of arabia clip\",\"lawrence of arabia theme\",\"lawrence of arabia part 1\",\"lawrence of arabia movie\",\"lawrence of arabia scene\",\"lawrence of arabia part 2\",\"peter otoole\",\"john dimech\",\"classic action adventure\",\"classic dramas\",\"classic war stories\",classics,epics,\"united kingdom\",\"robert a harris\",\"david lean\",\"jim painten\",\"heroism videos\",\"desert videos\",\"te lawrence\",daud,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++28608,/m/0gbvmj7,/m/0h0jz", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia (3/8) Movie CLIP - The Nefud Desert (1962) HD", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06T21:50:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "-tv56Xw0i5k", "description": "This episode of Lazy Girls' Guide to Beauty features JaaackJack: http://www.youtube.com/jaaackjack\n\nWelcome to another episode of Lazy Girls' Guide to Beauty, a brand-new, tip-filled show hosted by vlogger Jackie Perdue!

Archbishop Alencherry succeeded to the helm of the Syro-Malabar Church - the largest of those founded by Saint Thomas -- following the death of Cardinal Varkey Vithayathil earlier this year. Found primarily in Kerala southern India with more than 3.6 million believers, the Syro-Malabar Church is also the second largest Eastern Catholic Church in communion with the Bishop of Rome.\n\nBelow the full text of Pope Benedict's address to the delegation:\n\nI am pleased to greet you and the members of the Permanent Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church who have travelled to Rome in an expression of communion with the Successor of Peter, and I thank you for your kind words on their behalf and in your own name. This visit is a significant one, as it comes not long after your election as Major Archbishop. By coming here, you provide an eloquent sign of the hierarchical communion that you formally expressed in your recent letter to me requesting confirmation of your election.\n\nYour predecessor, the late Cardinal Varkey Vithayathil, has left a legacy upon which you and your brother Bishops will surely wish to build. In this context, I would like to recall the example of the two holy patrons of the Syro-Malabar Church, Saint Alphonsa Muttathupadathu and Blessed Kuriakose Elias Chavara, who were beatified by Blessed John Paul II, during his visit to Kerala twenty-five years ago. Later, the grace fell to me to canonize Saint Alphonsa in 2008.\n\nAt home, the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala continues to enjoy the respect of the local community for its work in education and for its social and charitable institutions at the service of the whole community. I know that life for Christians has been complicated by sectarian mistrust and even violence, but I would urge you to continue to work with people of good will of all religions in the area, in order to maintain the peace and harmony of the region, for the good of the Church and that of all citizens.\n\nWithin the Church itself, there are encouraging signs of vocations to the priesthood and the religious life which will help you to maintain your pastoral outreach. To be kept in mind are the ongoing challenges in the formation of the clergy and religious, in Christian family life and in the pastoral care of your faithful. I commend you for your efforts to maintain the strength of your family structures, the quality of Catholic education and catechesis at every level, and your pastoral work with youth. I also encourage you to continue your good work in fostering vocations among young men and women.\n\nIn fidelity to the Gospel and to the grace bestowed upon us by Christ our Lord, you and your faithful have flourished at home and abroad in union with the universal Church. By fostering your own authentic liturgical tradition, your faithful have been nourished by word and sacrament in accordance with what was handed down to you by your fathers in the faith. I am also aware of pastoral initiatives in favour of Syro-Malabar Catholics scattered throughout the world. As I did during your Ad Limina Visit in April, allow me again to encourage you in this important task and, especially with regard to your pastoral outreach to Syro-Malabar Catholics living beyond your homeland, I ask you to do so always mindful of the essential need for cooperation with Catholic Bishops and pastors of other rites.\n\nYour Beatitude, dear Brothers Bishops, with these few thoughts I commend you to the intercession of Saint Thomas, the great Apostle of India, Saint Alphonsa and Blessed Kuriakose. I assure you of my affection and prayers and I willingly impart to you, your clergy and religious and all those entrusted to your care, my Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of grace and peace in the Lord Jesus Christ.", "title": "Benedict XVI meets with representatives of the Syro-Malabar Church from India", "publishedDate": "2011-10-17T23:10:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-txGF1bp0Kk", "description": "Sumac 32710 1  For more information, visit http://www.respectfultransitions.com", "title": "Sumac 32710 1", "publishedDate": "2010-12-23T18:49:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "-txJ8lkbNJc", "description": "Video showing how a surgeon inserts a port into a patient during robot-assisted surgery for prostate cancer.

It was filmed at a private training session in August 2011 and we had just been looking at applications for the previous turn. This clip joins that session as we look at the \"lower-block\" posture and onwards.\n\nI see the Pinan / Heian kata as showing a combative progression from Pinan Shodan to Pinan Godan. It is therefore the bunkai that explains why Pinan Shodan is \"Number 1\" despite the fact that the solo form is harder that Pinan Nidan (which has seen the names swapped in Shotokan and the order changed in almost all dojo) i.e. the original order is for the progression of the bunkai; not the difficultly of solo forms.\n\nThe bunkai drills we teach for Pinan Shodan (Heian Nidan) cover the basic ways of manipulating a singe arm (among other things). In Pinan Nidan (Heian Shodan) we see both arms being controlled simultaneously and the methods used to exploit the opening building on things introduced previously.

First of all, the fact that there is a tear in there, you've got to be real careful and conservative in the beginning. \n\nWe typically use as therapists, an acronym called RICE, which is rest, ice, compression and elevation. Usually these patients have are having a lot of pain and a lot of swelling and those first few days are crucial to turn off some of that pain and swelling. So with the rest, the ice, the compression and the elevation that will really be helpful for a few days. Once there is an improvement in range of motion, once there's an improvement in the swelling and the pain you're going to move on to some exercises. \n\nAnd the first couple of exercises are going to to be trying to start pumping the actual muscles of your knee. So we're talking about isometric exercises for your quadriceps, isometric exercises for your hamstrings. These are easily done on the floor or in bed and you can be doing these at home. There is no reason to be going to a gym for this. Once you've done the isometric exercises, you can then move on to your heel slide, which is an exercise you can do on the floor or in bed as well. \n\nThis is a simple bending and straightening exercise, very little friction and very little resistance at all with the exercise. After a few days of doing that, you can then move on to doing these same heel slides, but maybe using your hand to assist and create some over-pressure to the pressure. That stage can last someone between one and three weeks. Somewhere in the middle of that stage though however, you can start to do some biking, some cycling at the gym, as well as doing some leg curls and some leg extension exercises, without any weight and then moving on with some weight. \n\nAnd then lastly, when you're dealing with a meniscus tear, you're going to want to start retraining on functional exercises, like your squats and your lunges and even your split squats. This is a higher level exercise that you want to wait until the end of the recovery process to work on. It really challenges the muscles of your leg to work in a functional manner, because we spend most of our day either getting up from chairs or going down stairs. These exercises really allow the muscles to work functionally. \n\nSo it's a four to six week process whether you are doing it on your own or in a physical therapy office, depending on the level of the injury. And again, if it's a post-operative person, then usually the doctor will tell us sort of where to go and when, in terms of how to time it and how to proceed and these are the options for a meniscus tear.", "title": "Physical Therapy for a Meniscus Tear | Knee Exercises", "publishedDate": "2013-07-25T02:17:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "-uEwfK-wM6o", "description": "[RELEASE]:\n~ Beatport: http://monster.cat/1aOBRjN\n~ Bandcamp: http://monster.cat/16TGGFV\n~ iTunes: http://monster.cat/1dzfXmW\n\n[FACEBOOK]:\n~ http://www.facebook.com/feintDnB\n\n[SOUNDCLOUD]:\n~ https://soundcloud.com/feintdnb\n\n[PICTURE]:\n~ http://bo0xvn.deviantart.com/art/202-275734773", "title": "Feint - Homebound (Teaser) (Monstercat)", "publishedDate": "2013-10-30T15:00:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "-uF-Q10WVZw", "description": "Eu sou o Caminho a Verdade e a Vida - fonte blog (bispo Macedo)", "title": "Solicitude da vida", "publishedDate": "2009-12-25T16:44:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-uFZ-CUH76o", "description": "Fight over new iPhone.

Foot is useful in locomotion.Dorsally visceral mass is covered by a thick sheet of skin called the mantle or pallium. It encloses a space called mantle or pallial cavity between itself and the body.Body is bilaterally symmetrical. In some molluscs such as pila the adults become asymmetrical due to torsion during growth.The body is covered by a shell made up of calcium carbonate and an organic substance called conchin. It is secreted by the shell glands of the mantle.The body cavity is haemocoel. True coelom is confined to the kidneys, gonads and pericardial space.Buccal cavity contains a \"rasping structure\" called radula [Radula is absent in bivalves.Respiratory organs are ctenidia (gills). Pulmonary sac and secondary branchiae occur in some species.Circulatory system is open type [closed type in cephalopods]. The blood flows through large \"sinuses\". Heart has generally two auricles and one ventricle. Respiratory pigment is haemocyanin [which contains copper].Excretion takes place by tubular metanephridia commonly called as kidneys. Glands of the pericardium secrete wastes into the coelom and nephridia passes them out.Each nephridium is connected with pericardial coelom through nephrostome. The other end opens into mantle cavity through nephridiopore.Nervous system is well developed with ganglia, commissures and connective.Special sense organs like osphradium, which tests the quality of water and the amount of sediment in it. These occur in the bivalves and gastropods. Other sense organs like tentacles and eyes are present. Statocystes occur in a majority of molluscs.They are mostly unisexual. Few are hermaphrodite.Cleavage is holoblastic and spiral.Development is direct or indirect. Modified trochophore larva is called veliger larva is present in the life history of many molluscs.Torsion is fundamental feature of gastropods. Torsion promotes stability in the adult.Classification of phylum mollusca :Phylum mollusca is divided into seven classes:1. Aplacophora, 2.Polyplacophora 3.Monoplacophora 4.Gastropod 5.Scaphopoda 6.Pelecypoda. and 7.Cephalopoda.\n\n7 Active Technology Solutions Pvt.Ltd. is an educational 3D digital content provider for\n K-12.

Today we're going to talk about lactose intolerance, which is a serious and sometimes silence problem for many individuals. Let's discuss why and what you can do about it. Lactose is the sugar that occurs naturally in cow's milk and other dairy products. Approximately 70 percent of the world adult population is lactose intolerant. \n\nLactase is the enzyme that allows us to digest lactose sugar. Lactase levels start to decline naturally in the small intestine of all mammals after they are weened. Some humans retain the ability to produce lactase throughout their lives, but most do not. Therefore, when an adult eats foods that contain lactose, it is not unusual for them to experience abdominal bloating, pain, fullness, cramps, noisy digestion,flatulence or gas, loose stools and sometimes diarrhea. \n\nSymptoms will vary from individual to individual, but depending on a variety of factors these symptoms are at least uncomfortable. Many medical experts now believe cow and dairy to be one of the more inflammatory food sources in our diet and that dairy intake may also contribute to insulin imbalances and sugar swings. \n\nLactose intolerance has also been found in several peer review studies in medical journals to be associated with increase in the need for oral thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with low thyroid conditions. Patients with Hashimoto's, thyroiditist, or inflammation of the thyroid, were found in one study to experience an improvement in their condition when lactose in their diet was restricted. One treatment, of course, of lactose intolerance would involve reducing the amount of lactose consumed and taking a lactase supplement every time lactose containing foods are consumed, however, given its association with this inflammation that we're concerned with, and the root of most chronic medical conditions today complete elimination of cow dairy for a few weeks as a trail can be very revealing to the patient and can eliminate many chronic symptoms such as bloating, reflux, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and sinus congestion to name a few. \n\nTherefore, complete elimination from the diet is usually recommended for optimal health.

Meiosis, however, requires two cell divisions because of the creation of haploid cells from the sister chromatids. Ninety percent of meiosis occurs in the first phase, known as Prophase I. In this phase, two very important events occur. The first is the formation of a tetrad through the process of synapsis. Synapsis is the pairing of homologous chromosomes, which form the tetrad structure. These tetrads create areas called chiasmata (chiasma, if singular), where homologous genetic material \"crosses over,\" or is exchanged. This exchange of homologous genetic information will be very important in further study of meiosis.\n\nTaught by Professor George Wolfe, this lesson was selected from a broader, comprehensive course, Biology. This course and others are available from Thinkwell, Inc. The full course can be found at http://www.thinkwell.com/student/product/biology. The full course covers evolution, ecology, inorganic and organic chemistry, cell biology, respiration, molecular genetics, photosynthesis, biotechnology, cell reproduction, Mendelian genetics and mutation, population genetics and mutation, animal systems and homeostasis, evolution of life on earth, and plant systems and homeostasis.\n\nFounded in 1997, Thinkwell has succeeded in creating \"next-generation\" textbooks that help students learn and teachers teach.

The rule is that if you own an apartment or multifamily building, you can write off the improvements in a straight line method over 27 in a half years.  If you own any other type of asset such as an office or warehouse that is then written off over 39 years.  Remember, you can ONLY depreciate the building, not the land.  The tax code basically says that land never uses its value.\n\nThere is a way however, to potentially write off portions of your building FASTER than the 27 in a half or 39 year time frame.  It's a process called cost segregation, or Accelerated Depreciation.  The concept is that even though the building may last for 27 in a half or 39 years, what about the windows?  The doors, the carpets, roof...bathrooms even?  What about all the little parts that make up a building?  Are those expected to last over two decades??  Absolutely not.  This is why all savvy investors should seriously consider conducting an accelerated depreciation study.   Let's run through an example to show you the benefits.\n\nLet's say you purchased a retail building for $2M.  And for the sake of making numbers easy, 50% of that value is allotted to the land, and the other half allotted to the improvements.  This means you can write off $1M over 39 years.  By doing so, you can write off $25,640/year in your taxes -- with the exception of your first and last year of ownership.  But again, what about the roof, the signage or anything else that exists in the building??  As the building owner, you then hire a person or a group to come out and do a study.  For a fee which will likely cost a few thousand dollars, they determine that certain parts of your building can be written off more quickly.  Windows, the roof and everything else, have a tax depreciation schedule of 3, 5, 7 years or whatever it may be.  And in fact, they determine the estimate replacement cost of those items.  \n\nNow, it's been determined that you can write off $50,000/year for 5 years, then $35k for 2 more years, and $20k after that!  Of course, this is a made up scenario, but the numbers aren't farfetched -- they are completely plausible.  In our scenario, over a 7 year timeframe you will have saved an ADDITIONAL $140k, or about $20,000 per year.  Depending on your tax base, the fee you paid the individual or group has easily paid for itself within a year or two.  \n\nIf you're wondering if getting an accelerated depreciation study is right for you, here are a few tips I always tell people.  First, don't use someone who isn't a professional.  Although this is a legitimate tax strategy, whoever does the study MUST have paperwork to back their claims in case you ever get audited.  Also, if you own a smaller building which cost under $300-400k, it starts to not be a profitable course.  Simply because the value of the taxes saved won't pay for the cost of the study in a meaningful timeframe.  However, if you own anything larger and are interested in saving some money, it would likely be in your best interest to contact the proper professional or group and see if it's worth it.  Most of the time the appraisers will let you know after conducting a calculating a quick assessment if the study is even worth pursuing...for free....now that's good to know.", "title": "Advantages of Accelerated Depreciation (Cost Segregation) in Real Estate", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T19:22:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ukBLNxdn4w", "description": "Check out these new styles and more from Zappos.com!", "title": "Lacoste Sculler Lo WCR SKU:#8050480", "publishedDate": "2012-11-29T19:00:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ukvjj2Dgb0", "description": "", "title": "KLOR  2013", "publishedDate": "2013-02-04T03:45:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ul2gi1brtk", "description": "video uploaded from my mobile phone", "title": "crazy zambian pipo", "publishedDate": "2014-04-22T19:22:33.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ul_iVYnIPo", "description": "Adrian Marcel performing 2AM Live at 1025 KSFM", "title": "ADRIAN MARCEL 2AM", "publishedDate": "2014-07-02T20:30:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ulhEc9YkNM", "description": "I walked through the first A340 to receive the new SWISS business class seat while I was at the inaugural in SFO.

The sounds that you hear, the things that you see, the chair that you're sitting in, you're feeling it, and be able to process those things, and be able to create an effective motor output.\n\n      So, for example, for me to be able to sit here, I have to block everything out around me. The little quiet hushing of the AC that's going on behind me, and the lights that are flashing in my eyes and things that I'm seeing, and this hard chair, in order to sit here and tell you what I'm thinking and what I'm telling you. \n\nNow this might seem simple, but it's really not for all children. Some children have a very difficult time doing it. For example, some kids may have a really hard time taking in the background noise. It might be too much for them. You might find that any kind of noise might be too much for them and they may cover their ears. And that might limit their ability to sit in a classroom and attend to the teacher, because that background noise is just too much for them. They may not be able to feel the input in their joints and sit at the chair. That might be too much for them too. The thing to remember is that we all have little sensory issues here and there. Like I don't like certain crunchy things because I don't like the way it feels.   \n\nEveryone has these little tiny things that they don't like. They may not like the label in there, in the back here. It might itch them. Everyone has little things. But when it becomes an issue that impacts a child's day to day living, that's a problem. \n\nSo if they're unable to sit and attend in the classroom, because they're unable to block out certain noises, or they're unable to get that input into their joints, they can't sit still in their chair because it doesn't feel good to them, that's a cause for concern. \n\nChildren with sensory processing disorder are either hypersensitive or hyposensitive to input. So some movement may be too much for them, or it might be too little for them. So some children may not want to sit in a swing because they don't want to feel any of that movement. Other kids might want to be in a swing all day long, and that's why you might see some kids running in circles, or running back and forth. They're constantly seeking that movement.

People normally have off-white to plain white teeth... depending on the colour of the dentin lying beneath the enamel. \nHowever, tooth discoloration is widely prevalent among a large number of people... The stains do not affect the functioning of the teeth... but are likely to make a person self-conscious.\nStrange as it may sound, things which people like the most... are things that have taken away the smiles of many....\nExcessive intake of tea, coffee, wine, colas, even chocolates and acidic foods can cause staining... Heavy smoking is another.\nAgeing as well as improper oral hygiene, too, can mar the beauty of your teeth. \n\nA visit to the dentist could be an expensive affair. However, there are some time-tested home remedies to whiten and brighten up teeth.\n\nHome Remedy 1\n\n\u2022 Put a quarter teaspoon of baking soda or sodium bicarbonate in a cup.\n\u2022 Add the quantity of toothpaste you want to use for brushing your teeth.\n\u2022 Mix them to get a gritty paste and brush your teeth with it.\n\u2022 Rinse with warm water.\n\u2022 Try this once or twice a week.\nBut there is a piece of caution here! Do not use baking soda in excess, as being abrasive it can erode the enamel.\nAdditional tip: Occasionally, you can mix baking soda with lemon juice, salt, white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. ...Or make a mouthwash by mixing one  tablespoon of baking soda and one and a half teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide in half a cup of water.\n\n\nHome Remedy 2\n\n\u2022 Take an orange rind or peel. Rinse it thoroughly.\n\u2022 Rub your teeth with the inner white portion. \n\u2022 Rinse your mouth.\n\u2022 Repeat as desired... preferably, before retiring to bed at night.\nOrange peel contains compounds that help remove superficial stains over a period of time. Unlike lemon peel, orange peel will not erode the tooth enamel as it does not contain citric acid.\n\n\nHome Remedy 3\n\n\u2022 Take crushed strawberries or tomatoes.\n\u2022 Rub your teeth with the pulp.\nStrawberry and tomato work as natural teeth whiteners. You can also try dried holy basil leaves for this purpose.", "title": "Home Remedies for Yellow Teeth - Get Shiny White Teeth", "publishedDate": "2014-04-20T08:47:49.000Z"}, {"_id": "-uzJA0fjNYw", "description": "Used Books, Free Shipping.

delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.\n3) When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.\n4) The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.\n5) It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.\n6) A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.\n7) A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.\n8) The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.\n9) He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.\n10) The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.\n11) The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.\n12) Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.\n13) He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.\n14) The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?\n15) The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\n16) A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.\n17) He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.\n18) The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.\n19) A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.\n20) A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.\n21) Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.\n22) Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.\n23) The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.\n24) A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.", "title": "Proverbs Chapter 18", "publishedDate": "2012-10-29T21:11:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-v7NCzcRCtk", "description":

and Michael Korb in 1982 for a Highland games held in Germany. It has been proposed as the Scottish national anthem to replace unofficial anthems Scotland the Brave and/or Flower of Scotland. It has subsequently undergone various orchestrations and had lyrics added in English and in Scottish Gaelic.\n\nThe tune has been performed by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, and featured in the album, Spirit of the Glen, which won a Classical Brit award in 2009. The song has been performed at numerous Scottish cultural events, including Scotland's Rugby Union games. The tune was the Royal Hong Kong Police Anthem under British rule which ended in 1997. It was played at a ceremonial lowering of the Governor's flag at Chris Patten's official residence, Government House in Central, on the last day of British rule. Highland Cathedral is Chris Patten's favourite pipe tune, as said by himself on a BBC Asia Today programme.

Saint Isidore would begin every day by going to Mass early in the morning. He depended totally on God and the help of the angels for his work and at times, would produce the amount of work as three laborers put together. One day, his master saw another plow drawn by white oxen next to the plow of Saint Isidore. He ran towards it, but as he drew near, they disappeared out of his master's sight. When he asked Saint Isidore about it, he responded by saying Sir, I work alone and know of none save God to whom I look for strength. Then St. Isidore's sanctity became known as such that the angels would help him even when he would plow the fields.\n\nSt Maria\nBirth: Uceda, Guadalajara, Spain; then lived in Torrelaguna, where she met St. Isidore\nFeast Day: September 9th and celebrated on May 15th (with her husband)\nOccupation: housewife.

Saint Maria last name is actually Toribia. The title \"of the Head\" came about because her head is a well-revered relic, venerated for centuries.

This opening - called the carpal tunnel is formed by arch-shaped wrist bones and a connecting ligament.\n \nVarious conditions, such as pregnancy, injury, arthritis and changes in the tendons caused by repetitive motion can crowd the already narrow tunnel, putting pressure on the nerve.\n \nThis added pressure can cause a tingling sensation in the fingers and the thumb and may even lead to numbness, pain and restricted movement. This combination of symptoms is called the carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nPatient Education Company\n\nYour doctor understands that all medical care benefits from close collaboration between physician and patient -- so be sure to review, with your doctor, all risks and alternatives and make sure you understand the reasons behind the recommendation for this particular procedure.\n\nNow let's talk in detail about the procedure your doctor has recommended. That particular recommendation was based on a number of factors:\n\n    * the state of your health,\n\n    * the severity of your condition,\n\n    * an assessment of alternative treatments or procedures and finally,\n\n    * the risks associated with doing nothing at all.\nPatient Education\nAnd remember, the final decision is up to you. No one can force you to undergo a surgical procedure against your will. \n\nWhen it comes to treating carpal tunnel syndrome, surgery is often recommended after other therapies have failed.\n \nIf your carpal tunnel syndrome is thought to be caused by repetitive motion or prolonged holding of the wrist in awkward positions,\n \nyour doctor may first ask you to wear a specially designed protective brace.\n  \nOther alternatives to surgery may include medication, exercise and physical therapy. If none of these treatments improve your condition - or if the condition was triggered by a problem that does not respond to these therapies - your doctor may recommend surgery.\n  \nBecause increased pain and further restriction of hand function are likely if the condition is left untreated.\n  \nNow I'd like to introduce you to another important member of the medical team -- the nurse. \n\nPatient Education Company", "title": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Repair Surgery - PreOp\u00ae Patient Education Medical HD", "publishedDate": "2013-03-02T19:16:11.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vSjLxoI1Pc", "description": "Holy Chill\nFacebook : http://lc.cx/JCL\nSoundcloud : https://soundcloud.com/holychill\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/HolyChill\n\nAVAILABLE : http://theravadarecords.bandcamp.com/album/uchronia\n\nKeizan\nhttps://soundcloud.com/keizan\nhttps://www.facebook.com/keizanprod\nhttp://keizantheravada.bandcamp.com/\n\nTheravadarecords\nhttp://theravadarecords.bandcamp.com/album/uchronia\n\nPicture credit not found\n\n*If any producer or label has an issue with any of the uploads please get in contact with me and I will delete it immediately (this includes artists of the images used).", "title": "Keizan - Lyon Blues", "publishedDate": "2014-07-19T13:47:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vSvSXjgTkY", "description": "", "title": "One Life To Live- Dorian & Vicki Bicker 1992", "publishedDate": "2009-04-21T16:58:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vTFH3GLJKA", "description": "Scuba Diving: Ambergris Caye, Belize\n\nVideo shows a compilation of lionfish getting speared.

It's sounding like a hate crime. I just want something done about it. No telling who's going to be jumped next,\" Andrew said.\n\nWe obtained a copy of the letter sent from the Akron Mayor's office to the F.B.I.\n\nIt asks for a determination whether this is a hate crime and, therefore, the responsibility of federal investigators.\n\n\"I'm hoping they can get down to the bottom of this, find them, and prosecute them,\" Marty said.\n\n\"You want answers and you don't know if you'll get the answers but you feel safer knowing someone is listening,\" Yvonne said.\n\nAkron police are investigating and, reportedly, the gang unit is also involved.

Inoltre, il nostro know-how ci ha permesso di superare tutti gli aspetti critici comunemente legati alla produzione di forcine, quali la forma del taglio e la lunghezza dei bracci. Abbiamo infatti introdotto un nuovo concetto di taglio orbitale che, oltre ad allungare enormemente la vita degli utensili, crea una perfetta e leggerissima rastrematura delle estremit\u00e0 dei tubi, favorendo cos\u00ec l'inserimento degli stessi nel pacco alettato; inoltre, un'identica lunghezza dei bracci \u00e8 assicurata da un sofisticato algoritmo che gestisce tutte le fasi operative della produzione delle forcine. Le forcinatrici sono disponibili a 4, 6 o 8 forcine, anche in versioni combinate, con lunghezze delle forcine comprese tra 150 e 4250mm e diametri compresi tra 5mm (1/6\") e 16mm (5/8\"). La forcinatrice standard \u00e8 dotata di controllo a 4 assi; il quinto asse \u00e8 opzionale e si pu\u00f2 abbinare a macchine combinate.\n\nSempre all'avanguardia e attenta alle evoluzioni del settore, C.M.S. recentemente ha introdotto sul mercato una nuova gamma di forcinatrici (patent pending) completamente asservita da motori elettrici, eliminando quindi totalmente la trasmissione idraulica della potenza. Questa importantissima innovazione, oltre ad una pi\u00f9 facile ed efficace gestione dell'operativit\u00e0 della macchina, assicura una maggiore produttivit\u00e0 essendo dotata di algoritmi di controllo ottimizzati; garantisce inoltre l'assenza di vibrazioni del braccio piega, per una maggiore durata delle parti in movimento, riduce drasticamente l'assorbimento elettrico legato al processo di forcinatura,  annulla il rumore tipico delle centraline idrauliche ed elimina i rischi ambientali dovuti alla presenza dell'olio.\n____________________________________________________________________\nOur hairpin bending machines represent the synthesis of the most advanced technology and versatility of use: each detail is designed and manufactured to assure reliability, productivity, accuracy, and durability. Furthermore, our know-how has allowed us to overcome all of the critical aspects commonly associated with the production of hairpins, such as the cutting shape and the  length of the arms. Indeed, we have introduced a new orbital cutting concept that in addition to greatly extend the life of the tools, creates a perfect and very slight tapering of the ends of the tubes, thus easing the insertion of the same in the finned coil; in addition, an identical length of the arms is ensured by a sophisticated algorithm that manages all the operating production phases of the hairpins. The hairpin bending machines are available with 4, 6 or 8 hairpins, also in combined versions, with lengths of the hairpins ranging between 150 and 4250 mm and diameters ranging between 5 mm (3/16 \") and 16 mm (5/8\"). The standard hairpin bending machine features a 4-axis control; the fifth axis is optional and can be provided for combined machines.\n\nAlways at the forefront of and focused on industry trends, C.M.S. recently introduced a new range of hairpin bending machines (patent pending) on the market completely served by electric motors, thus eliminating completely hydraulic power transmission. This very important innovation, in addition to an easier and more effective management of the operations of the machine, assures a higher productivity being provided with optimized control algorithms; moreover, it guarantees the absence of vibrations of the bending arm for a greater duration of the moving parts, drastically reduces power consumption related to the hairpin bending process, eliminates the noise typical of hydraulic power units and avoids the environmental risks posed by the presence of oil.", "title": "CMS Forcinatrice / Hairpin bender", "publishedDate": "2014-02-25T08:11:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vhzt8QFXTQ", "description": "", "title": "r1b", "publishedDate": "2011-08-18T23:31:02.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vi-IPlV4dc", "description": "This video is part of a grouping of videos on how to do a tune-up.

With years of experience in the gym she has come across all sorts of myths and misconceptions amongst women who try to achieve an athletic, sexy physique but consistently make mistakes in order to do so.\nFULL BODY LICIOUS WORKOUT\n\n\nAccording to Flavia, the key to a top female physique is simply the ratio between the body fat and the muscle mass composition. Reduce fat (not generic body weight, not water, but adipose tissue only) and replaced it with a suitable amount of muscle and you'll have a transformed physique.\n\nThe way to do this is by performing workout sessions targeting each major muscle group without neglecting the rest of the body. The workouts can be made at the gym or at home with basic equipment as illustrated by the home gym version part of the program. Even though the workouts are relatively simple, they are not easy because they require commitments and effort. As Flavia points out, \"You don't get a body like mine training like a girl!\" FULL BODY LICIOUS WORKOUT\n\n\nHowever, this is the very same program that helped Flavia DelMointe reduce her body fat from 18% to 13.4% in less than 10 weeks to get ready for the pictures shown on her website. Expected results, Falvia claims, are around 1% to 2% body fat loss each week for about 3 to 4 months before the workouts need to be restructured to prevent adaptation and staleness.\n\nThis kind of training triggers metabolism into overdrive, burning fat up to 48 hours after a workout, therefore reducing the fat layer above the muscles and giving definition. As a result, the body composition ratio completely changes the way your body look.

It empowers women through an informal, home-based, peer-led intervention programme on HIV/AIDS and gender-violence. Women meet in homes for five weekly sessions on gender pride, HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health rights, self-assertiveness and self-care, and advocacy. Self-esteem is boosted through the sharing of poetry and songs at the beginning and end of each session. A trained facilitator, who also leads the participants into role-plays and other interactive skills to practice assertiveness and self-care techniques, communicates key concepts on each topic. Condom demonstrations -- male and female -- are also used to empower women to protect themselves and their partners. All participants learn about the different types of gender violence and the social, economic, mental and emotional impact it can have on them and their loved ones. Participants learn how to get a protection order and how to navigate the medical and legal system if they or someone they know has been raped. Each participant develops a crisis plan and a list of important numbers and references. The closing session is a vehicle through which SISI circles develop an advocacy campaign to assist women and children in their communities. Participants return for a follow-up session within two months to track progress on their advocacy campaigns and to reflect on and further practice key skills learned in the SISI circles. The final session, approximately two months after the follow-up session is a graduation programme whereby all SISI circles come together to celebrate and share their accomplishments in sisterhood.", "title": "SISI Promotional Video", "publishedDate": "2008-05-08T13:21:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vmoOc_A7oo", "description": "Watch a collection of the best points from the Shanghai Rolex Masters doubles final.", "title": "Shanghai 2014 Doubles Final Hot Shots", "publishedDate": "2014-10-12T07:50:25.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vmzFYePXn8", "description": "", "title": "Bronx grocery store shooting", "publishedDate": "2014-08-04T11:29:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vn-Ylw-Glg", "description": "eGovernment e Governance", "title": "eGovernment e Governance", "publishedDate": "2013-06-14T20:33:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vn5sdWLVPM", "description": "", "title": "iLEUM @ Hoornse Stadsfeesten", "publishedDate": "2009-06-23T14:42:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vnEjqzgKdU", "description": "http://zdrowotne-materace.pl/index.php?route=product/product&filter_name=air+air&product_id=201\nPolecamy Ci doskona\u0142y materac lateksowy firmy Hevea\nModel: Comfort Air Air\n\n\n\nZ my\u015bl\u0105 o Twoim komfortowym i wygodnym \u015bnie\nmaterac Comfort Air Air wykonali\u015bmy\nspecjalnie dla Ciebie z wysokiej jako\u015bci lateksu.\nWymiana powietrze nast\u0119puje 2 razy szybciej\nni\u017c w zwyk\u0142ym wk\u0142adzie lateksowym.\nPionowe kanaliki sprawi\u0105, \u017ce wewn\u0105trz materaca\nb\u0119dzie doskona\u0142a wentylacja.\nZapewni Ci to higieniczn\u0105 stref\u0119 odpoczynku.\n\nTw\u00f3j kr\u0119gos\u0142up b\u0119dzie idealnie podparty.\nGwarantuje Ci to 7 stref twardo\u015bci wk\u0142adu lateksowego.\n\n\n\nAtutem materaca jest r\u00f3wnie\u017c pokrowiec Aloe Vera,\nkt\u00f3ry zawiera aminokwasy, substancje mineralne i enzymy,\ndzi\u0119ki temu pozwala lepiej si\u0119 zrelaksowa\u0107 podczas snu\ni dobroczynnie wp\u0142ywa na Twoja sk\u00f3r\u0119.\n\nMaterac idealnie dopasuje do stela\u017cy regulowanych.\n\n\nBudowa materaca Comfort Air Air:\nP\u0142yta lateksowa -- 18cm\nPokrowiec Aloe Vera\n\nMaterac dwustronny, \u015brednio twardy\nWysoko\u015b\u0107 materaca 20 cm\nhttp://youtu.be/-vnEjqzgKdU", "title": "Hevea materac Air Air materac z dziurk\u0105... dla pan\u00f3w?", "publishedDate": "2013-07-11T18:18:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-vnGdIdPG5E", "description": "The America (LHA 6) Amphibious Assault Ship, built by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, MS, sails the Gulf of Mexico on builder's sea trials, Nov. 7-9, 2013.\n\nLHA Amphibious Assault Ship\n\nAn LHA is 844 feet long with a 106-foot beam.

So, now I'm going to show you the importance of bowing open strings. As a beginner, but also as you get more advanced, it's every important to always go back to open strings. And make sure you're doing everything right in terms of sound and bow division so that you have the optimum sound quality that you want to achieve. \n\nFirst, you would start with the A string. Now, in a previous video we spoke about how the fingers should be curled at the frog. And then straightened at the tip for the best bow weight distribution. That's very important when doing your open strings. \n\nAnother very important thing about bowing open strings is where you are, where your bow is, on your string. Now, I call these lanes. This is lane one. It's equal to the amount of hair you have and it's right next to the bridge. That's lane one. Now this is the sound you would get if you played in lane one. \n\nNot very good. So, now I'm going to move the bow over a little to lane two. That was nice and big and pretty. Here's lane three. I would say lane three is smack in the middle. A lot of people like lane three the best. But, I think it's really important to play in lane two the best. It's a beautiful sound. But it has power and even though you need to know how to play in all the lanes, lane two is that big, powerful sound you want to achieve and it's a little harder to play there consistently than lane three. So, it's a good one to practice. \n\nLane four is getting a little bit closer to the finger board. And when you get a little bit closer to the finger board, you'll notice that the sound decreases. And this is lane five, almost on the finger board. \nSo, your optimum place when playing open strings is in lane two. \n\nSo, now you know two things. You're gonna curl your fingers at the frog and you're place the bow in lane two. And make sure that it's a really straight line, very parallel to the bridge.  You don't want the bow this way.

It was of small enough scale that it could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[2][3]\n\n\n\nCugnot's steam wagon, the second (1771) version\n\n\nA replica of Richard Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive 'Puffing Devil'\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier \u00e0 vapeur (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The centre of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth, and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne.[4] Such vehicles were in vogue for a time, and over the next decades such innovations as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some were commercially successful in providing mass transit, until a backlash against these large speedy vehicles resulted in the passage of the Locomotive Act (1865), which required self-propelled vehicles on public roads in the United Kingdom to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively killed road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. (The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.)\n\nThe first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\n19th century[edit]\nAmong other efforts, in 1815, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car.[5]:p.27 Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a four-seat steam phaeton.[5]:p27\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec, and again the following year.[6] The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.[7]\n\nWhat some people define as the first \"real\" automobile was produced by French Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e in 1873, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on May 8, 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a 4-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the US 549160[8] was granted on November 5, 1895.\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of numerous car-related technologies, received a German patent in 1886.[9]\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine that constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion is a creation of Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838.[citation needed] The battery electric car owes its beginnings to \u00c1nyos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Plant\u00e9, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.[citation needed]\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam powered vehicle invented in 1871, by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875, to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than five miles per hour over a 200 mile course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on July 16, 1878, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort iles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.[10]", "title": "bstoner 2g eclipse 10 25 vs clean Laser 11 7 Showdown at E town 8 16 09 New  Car Donation", "publishedDate": "2014-05-20T18:04:19.000Z"}, {"_id": "-w5UKg7qMzk", "description": "The Oriental Garden Lizard, Eastern Garden Lizard or Changeable Lizard (Calotes versicolor) is an agamid lizard found widely distributed in Asia.\nIt is an insectivore and the male gets a bright red throat in the breeding season leading to a common incorrect name of \"Bloodsucker\".\n\nCe lezard est un \"Calotes Verisicolor\" vivant en asie.

Advanced electronic devices such as portable computers and cell phones allow people to perform much more effectively than ever before. With mobility comes the increased need for portable power sources.\n\nFortunately, this advancement in electronics is matched with improvements in batteries that power these devices. Ni-MH batteries provide much more power than the Ni-Cd batteries and also eliminate any concerns on the usage of heavy metals in the making of these cells.\n\n The exciting new technology used in the sealed Ni-MH rechargeable batteries provides optimum results for battery-powered devices, in terms of performance and environmental friendliness.\n\nIntroduced to the commercial market in 1988, the Ni-MH battery is still at an early stage of maturity, but has already proven to be an attractive power source for today's devices.\n\nThere are several benefits of Ni-MH batteries, such as a higher energy density, which is almost 40% more than the nickel-cadmium batteries. This increase in energy density helps with providing longer run times, which means longer service life than ordinary batteries of the same size. \n\nThey also charge much faster, in approximately one hour. They are safe to use and designed to withstand a variety of abusive conditions in consumer devices. Unlike the Ni-Cd batteries and other battery systems, they are environmental friendly, as there is no fear of cadmium, mercury or lead toxicity.\n\nToday, the Ni-MH battery is hugely popular with high-end portable electronic devices where the performance of the battery translates into run-time, which is a major consideration for a consumer and influences their decision in the purchase of product. The reduced weight and volume also play an important role.\n\nNi-MH batteries are similar to Ni-Cd batteries as they use the same technology. The only difference is that they use hydrogen-absorbing negative electrode instead of the cadmium-based electrode used in Ni-Cd. \n\nThis small change increases the electrical capacity of the battery as well as eliminates the toxicity problem. The problem of \"memory\" does not exist in the Ni-MH batteries, as there is no cadmium used.\n\nThese batteries are designed to ensure maximum safety with a safety vent, to avoid build up of pressure in case of being exposed to high temperature, charged excessively or abused in other ways. \n\nThey can also be used in any position and the only maintenance that is needed is to keep them dry and clean while in use as well as in storage. Whether stored when charged or discharged, nothing happens to these batteries.\n\n\n\nClick the link below to check it out \nhttp://battery-reviver.info-pro.co\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel\n\n\nhttp://repair-a-battery.blogspot.com/\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wB8N3Eb68U\nHow To Repair A Laptop Battery, Repair Lead Acid Battery, Recondition Car Battery\nHow To Repair A Laptop Battery,\nlipo battery repair, \nrecondition battery car, \nrecondition lipo battery, \nbattery reviver, \nhow to fix nicad battery, \nhow to recondition batteries at home, \nrestore dead battery, \nhtc incredible battery fix, \nhow to increase battery life of a laptop, \nrevive battery, \nbuy replacement laptop battery, \nhow to replace laptop battery,", "title": "How To Repair A Laptop Battery, Repair Lead Acid Battery, Recondition Car Battery", "publishedDate": "2014-04-01T14:59:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wBL0hxqHU8", "description": "Full review is now available! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkgbcSicgKk \nI had 5 minutes to try out the Pioneer DDJ SZ today so I decided to test it's ability to be used for turntablism tricks like backspinning, scratching and juggles.

In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add a certain amount of water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. \"Blended cements\" and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.\n\n Cement\u00a0 Manufacturing\u00a0 Home\u00a0 Manufacturing\u00a0 Technical\u00a0 Committee\u00a0 Technical Info\u00a0 How Cement\u00a0 is Made\u00a0 About the\u00a0 Cement\u00a0 Industry\u00a0 Cement\u00a0 History\u00a0 Virtual\u00a0 Plant Tour\u00a0 Resources\u00a0\n\n It is sign of grinding within vertical roller mills the power input towards the materials per move between curler as well as desk is little, that reason a large number of goes by have to have the required particular power input to the materials.

Although the rhinoceros is referred to as black, its colors vary from brown to gray.\n\nThe other African rhinoceros is the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). The word \"white\" in the name \"white rhinoceros\" is a misinterpretation of the Afrikaans word wyd, itself derived from the Dutch word wijd for wide, referring to its square upper lip, as opposed to the pointed or hooked lip of the black rhinoceros. These species are now sometimes referred to as the square-lipped (for white) or hook-lipped (for black) rhinoceros.\n\nThe species overall is classified as critically endangered, and one subspecies, the western black rhinoceros, was declared extinct by the IUCN in 2011.\n(Wikipedia)\n---\nweb: www.zoodvurkralove.cz", "title": "Rhinoceros needs Dentist", "publishedDate": "2014-02-26T15:14:23.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wEh-mFcEHY", "description": "NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured amazing images of a \"significant\" solar flare emitted from the Sun on September 10.

For more information on Dr. Umar's laser tattoo removal [http://www.finetouchdermatology.com/los-angeles-laser-tattoo-removal] procedure, \n\nThe patient in this video had the word \"Faith\" tattooed on her arm in blue and black ink.  She decided that she no longer wanted it. As you can see in the video she is excited that she can wear sleeveless shirts to work and no longer has to hide her arm.\n\nDr. Umar used the Spectra VRMIII laser. This is a system which uses a 1064nm wavelength which is able to reach deeper layers of the skin. It is not easily absorbed by melanin. So it offers a much higher degree of safety for all skin tones, since overheating and subsequent scarring is not an issue.\n\nThe patient only needed three treatments to have her tattoo completely removed. \n\nAfter the first session, the treated area was very red. There is usually crusting on the skin, which sloughs off within 2 weeks.\n\nAfter the second session, the tattoo had faded considerably, but the design was still visible. \n\nAfter the third session, the tattoo was completely gone.\n\nThe patient also had a very small tattoo on her hand. This only required one session for complete removal. \n\nDr. Umar explains that professional tattoos are difficult to remove because they are deeply established in lower layers of the skin.  Lasers are considered to be ideal for tattoo removal because they actually break up the pigment. Several weeks are required for the pigment to be eliminated by the body's natural system.  This is why individual sessions need to be scheduled around 3-8 weeks apart.\n\nOverall, there was no pain or discomfort during and after the procedure.", "title": "Los Angeles Laser Tattoo Removal Using the Spectra Laser -  before and after", "publishedDate": "2011-12-21T06:04:45.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wG3OWfLJEU", "description": "Chuck's LSX Tuning had his nice C7 at the Texas Speed Syndicate track day.

While Lockwood and Lamont personify smoldering passions onscreen, in real life the down-to-earth Lockwood can't stand the egotistical, brainless Lina. He prefers the company of aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), whom he met while escaping his screaming fans. Watching these intrigues from the sidelines is Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Don's best pal and on-set pianist. Cosmo is promoted to musical director of Monumental Pictures by studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) when the talking-picture revolution commences. That's all right for Cosmo, but how will talkies affect the upcoming Lockwood-Lamont vehicle \"The Dueling Cavalier\"? Don, an accomplished song-and-dance man, should have no trouble adapting to the microphone. Lina, however, is another matter; put as charitably as possible, she has a voice that sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. The disastrous preview of the team's first talkie has the audience howling with derisive laughter. On the strength of the plot alone, concocted by the matchless writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Singin' in the Rain is a delight. But with the addition of MGM's catalog of Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown songs -- \"You Were Meant for Me,\" \"You Are My Lucky Star,\" \"The Broadway Melody,\" and of course the title song -- the film becomes one of the greatest Hollywood musicals ever made.\n\n\"singin' in the rain\",\"singin' in the rain clip\",\"singin' in the rain part 1\",\"singin' in the rain trailer\",\"jean hagen\",\"debbie reynolds\",\"donald oconnor\",\"millard mitchell\",\"stanley donen\",\"gene kelly\",\"microphone videos\",\"classic movie musicals\",classics,musicals,\"showbiz comedies\",\"arthur freed\",\"roger edens\",\"acceptance videos\",\"deception videos\",\"despair videos\",\"stage videos\",\"don lockwood\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++44857,/m/036jb,/m/04cyjt,/m/01wrn5,/m/04ql20,/m/01mmslz", "title": "Singin' in the Rain (7/8) Movie CLIP - Switch-a-Roo (1952) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-05-27T01:39:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wI7JwOs-yA", "description": "", "title": "MILIEN PIERRE-JEAN - Mwen Bezw'on Fanm/REMIX (dj-Excellent)", "publishedDate": "2013-12-29T22:40:29.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wIEihDAcpU", "description": "Luke laughs hysterically as mama imitates him crawling around the house in the morning.\nLess than a minute and guaranteed to brighten your day...", "title": "Best ever laughing baby", "publishedDate": "2007-10-30T17:54:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wISi1H8KBg", "description": "Follow me at https://twitter.com/YTYogaFlame24\nhttp://www.ssfranking.com", "title": "Ace ( Guile ) Vs CCG Air ( Ryu )  USF4 1080p - 60fps", "publishedDate": "2014-11-11T14:21:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wIXwZvLBwk", "description": "pressekonferenz 1997 ausschnitte\n\nNach zwei erfolgreichen Alben vollzog Tic Tac Toe 1997 eine \u00f6ffentlichkeitswirksame Trennung. 2005 trat die Gruppe wieder in ihrer Originalbesetzung auf und versuchte ein Comeback.

First the powder is pressed and cemented, as the result of which a solid perforated body is formed, the surface of which is expanded to a maximum. After the glazing the tablet is oxidized electrochemically in order to form oxide coating on the grains. To produce the second facing (the cathode) the oxidized tablet is coated with marganese dioxide pyrolitically. In both cases the anode is placed inside a leakproof casing. The technologies of producing tantalum and niobium oxide semi-conducting liquid condensers are generally similar and constitute a range of specific operations: pressing, high-temperature vacuum cementing, pyrolitic marganese dioxide coating, silvering, leading and tinning of the layer. The advantages of the volume-perforated condensers are: long storage life up 25 years, high specific capacity and low reactive resistance.

They are arboreal (tree dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America. Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They can move at a some what higher speed if they are in immediate danger from a predator, but they burn large amounts of energy doing so. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrition and do not digest easily. Sloths therefore have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. \nTheir specialized hands and feet have long, curved claws to allow them to hang upside-down from branches without effort. While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from limbs.

The pencil doesn\u2019t leave the paper in cursive writing and letters flow together.\n\n\nStep 1: Study the alphabet\nFind and download practice sheets from the internet. Study the cursive alphabet and examine how each letter is formed. \n\nTip\nPlace tracing paper over the practice sheet and trace the letters with your pencil. This will train you to mimic the flow of the letters and obtain the proper form.\n\nStep 2: Practice the letters\nPractice writing each letter of the alphabet. Write the letters over and over until they look like the letters on your practice sheets.\n\nTip\nRather than practicing letters in alphabetical order, group similarly shaped letters together. For example, write h, n, m, and x together.\n\nStep 3: Expand your repertoire\nWrite your name in cursive, which is your signature. Practice copying short sentences from a book, until you can form the letters without thinking. \n\nStep 4: Write paragraphs\nProceed to writing full paragraphs. Be sure to incorporate the more uncommon letters, such as the capital Q, X, Z, and F, in your writings in order to master them.\n\nStep 5: Keep practicing\nKeep practicing your cursive writing until it\u2019s second nature. \n\nDid You Know?\nA recent study showed that children write faster and longer with a pen rather than when typing on a keyboard.", "title": "How to Write in Cursive", "publishedDate": "2010-04-29T12:00:34.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wj66o0ja7s", "description": "Let's read, sing , chant and play!

Its sleek, high-aspect ratio wing and flowing fuselage offer the ability to slip cleanly through the air and connect with thermal activity. When the air doesn't deliver the lift you want, just add throttle and the high-torque outrunner motor whips the folding prop to life. Enjoy zooming performance that will take you to the prevailing winds, or perform basic aerobatics with grace and precision. With working flaps at your command, it's possible to improve lift for takeoff or create drag to pin-point land with ease. Best of all, this exciting park-size motor glider features advanced AS3X\u00ae (Artificial Stabilization - 3-aXis) technology that works behind the scenes to smooth out the effects of forces like P-factor, turbulence and torque.

There are millions of waste pickers worldwide, predominantly in developing countries, but increasingly in post-industrial countries as well.\n\nForms of waste picking have been practiced since antiquity, but modern traditions of waste picking took root during industrialization in the nineteenth century. Over the past half-century, waste picking has expanded vastly in the developing world due to urbanization.\n\nIn many cities, they provide the only solid waste collection service. A methodological tool is available, offering a systematic approach to include / integrate initiatives (Integration Radar or InteRa).\n\nMany terms are used to refer to people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or personal consumption. In English, these terms include rag picker, reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicl\u00e1veis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is \"informal sector recycling\". However, the word 'informal' can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.\n\nIn 2008, participants of the The First World Conference of Waste Pickers chose to use the term \"waste picker\" for English usage to facilitate global communication. The term \"scavenger\" is also commonly used, but many waste pickers find it demeaning due to the implied comparison with animals.\n\nA waste picker is different from a waste collector because the waste collected by the latter may be destined for a landfill or incinerator, not necessarily for a recycling facility.\n\n\"Dumpster diving\" generally refers to the practice of anti-consumer and freegan activists who reclaim items such as food and clothes from the waste stream as a form of protest against consumer culture. \"Waste picking\" generally refers to activity motivated purely by economic need.\n\nsource - Wikipedia\n\nThis footage is part of the professionally-shot broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest collection of HD imagery from South Asia.

These lobes aid in prey capture by physically channeling prey towards mouth and by facilitating affect of suction mechanics on shellfish by enclosing area around prey, thus increasing suction potential which draws shellfish towards ray mouth. Mechanics employed by cownose ray for securing both single (cultchless) and SOS oysters into mouth for manipulation and subsequent crushing involved repeated suction generated by water brought into the orobranchial cavity through the mouth by rhythmic opening and closing of gill slits and spiracles. Gill slits and spiracles close while water is brought in through the mouth generating sucking action.\n\nAt the completion of each sucking episode, gills open expelling water from orobranchial cavity, and then close again, to repeat this suction cycle if needed for prey capture. In prey capture, this suction behavior is combined with the protrusion of upper jaw and depression of lower jaw which maximizes jaw gape and aids in securing shellfish between jaws.\n\n(Find full report online: http://web.vims.edu/library/GreyLit/VIMS/mrr10-10.pdf)", "title": "Cownose rays shown using specialized fins to sort and manipulate oysters.", "publishedDate": "2010-09-30T15:13:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wrIOW8mcvQ", "description": "The Smithsonians National Zoo now has a new baby giant elephant-shrew\u2014also known as a sengi.

In this game, there are four things that are different from standard Monopoly. First, the object of Monopoly Millionaire is to be the first player to accumulate one million dollars. Players can also upgrade their movers to give themselves a better chance of winning. Property spaces start with Fortune cards on them. And there are Millionaire Lifestyle cards.\n\nSet up the game board as shown in the instructions. There is no banker because all the money is kept in the center of the board. One player will be designated as the Property Agent to take care of title deeds, houses, and hotels. Players choose which mover set they want to use. There are four basic movers\u2014scooter, go-kart, canoe, and paper airplane\u2014and each has two other upgraded movers. So if you start with the canoe, you can upgrade to a speedboat and then a yacht. Place all the basic movers on Go. Each player starts with $372 million.\n\nPlayers then take turns rolling the dice and moving that number of spaces around the board. If a player lands on a space with a Fortune card, he reads the card to himself and follows the instructions. Some Fortune cards are to be used right then, while others are to be used later.\n\nIf a player lands on an unowned property space, he can buy it for the price on the board or put it up for auction. If the property space is owned, he must pay rent to the owner.\n\nIf a player lands or passes Go on his turn, he has the option to collect his salary from the bank and pay to upgrade his mover.\n\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Millionaire Lifestyle space, he takes the top card from the appropriate card pile and follows its instructions.\n\nAnd just like original Monopoly, there is a Go to Jail space, a Just Visiting space, and a Free Parking space.\n\nEither on your turn or between other player's turns, you can buy houses and hotels (as long as you own a pull property color set) and do deals with other players, such as swapping properties or offering money to get something you want.\n\nMonopoly Millionaire is for two to four players. It comes with a game board, 22 Title Deed cards, four sets of movers (three per player), 22 Fortune cards, 14 Millionaire Lifestyle cards, 14 Chance cards, 32 houses, 12 hotels, two die, money, a bank tray, and four Reminder cards.", "title": "Monopoly Millionaire from Hasbro", "publishedDate": "2012-08-13T16:32:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "-ws7k39pk7Q", "description": "CP-e Quickpower and Austenite Cat Back exhaust sound clips.", "title": "Sonata 2.0T 3\" CP-e Midpipe Cat Back Exhaust sound(4)", "publishedDate": "2013-02-02T21:47:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wsETTbybeI", "description": "...", "title": "V-Nonspecific #1...", "publishedDate": "2006-09-14T00:51:38.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wsqSm-3r_M", "description": "DRUMLINE: A NEW BEAT  |  VH1 + Monday Oct 27 @ 9/8c\n\nFor Booking Contact Management\n404-804-5579 \n| archivebooking@gmail.com | \n\nSubscribe to our Channel: http://ow.ly/9r4aV\n\nSubscribe to our Website: http://ephudson.com\n\nArchive Ent's Twitter http://ow.ly/9r4hO\n\nEmmanuel IG: Kosher_kodaks\nPhillip Hudson IG: Lantbo\nEmmanuel & Phillip's Twitter http://ow.ly/9r4wn \nEmmanuel Hudson's Twitter http://ow.ly/9r3nn\nPhillip Hudson's Twitter http://ow.ly/9r3ry\nReverbnation http://ow.ly/9r4ts\nFacebook http://ow.ly/9r3xm\nGoogle + http://ow.ly/9r484\nTumblr http://ow.ly/9r4dL\n\nThis is a channel thats created for fun, happiness, creativity, and laughter.", "title": "Drumline: A New Beat (Audition Spoof) Emmanuel & Phillip Hudson Ft.

This experimental avant-garde ensemble is now ready to conquer the European market and has geared up with a unique compilation, Badtriptych, presenting 22 of the best tracks from their previous \"Bad Trip Simulator\" album series.\n\n\"Bad trip is a slang term for a psychedelic crisis, a disturbing experience sometimes associated with use of a psychedelic drug such as LSD, Salvinorin A, mescaline, psilocybin or DMT. The manifestations can range from feelings of vague anxiety and alienation to profoundly disturbing states of unrelieved terror, ultimate entrapment, or cosmic annihilation. Add some Samba to that and you will have the time of your life!\"\n\nOn Badtriptych the band encapsulates their fight against the common perceptions of Brazilian popular music, by incorporating elements traditionally considered as taboos in this category of music: distortion, cynicism, dissonance, confusion, vocal screams, clashing harmonies and obscure sounding notes. Armed with remarkable skills, creativity and innovation Satanique Samba Trio has come to put your musical senses up for a true challenge, far away from the easefulness of samba and bossanova as you know it. \n\nDrawing inspiration from artists such as Anton Webern, Milton Banana Trio, Gustav Mahler and Banda de P\u00edfanos de Caruaru, SS3 serves up music that is as complex as it is fun and as strange as it is catchy. Bassist and composer Munha da 7 describes the purpose of Satanique Samba Trio's music as a concept developed as a relief for ears tired by mainstream radio play lists composing our lives. They are musicians with a mission to offer not only music for the joys and positive moments of life but to provide a soundtrack to accompany also the darkness and horror of our everyday lives.\n\nBadtriptych isn't the album to put on in the background, but will fight every second for your undivided attention - as soon as you think you have grasped the essence of their intriguing sound you will get thrown head first into their imaginative world of tricks and treats. In this mix of short and explosive tracks you can clearly hear elements of a variety of genres and all mixed together the ensemble manage to present a brand new and fresh sound. Horrifying, intriguing, confusing and brilliant -- all at the same time!\n\nIf you're at all a fan of mainstream music it is at first sight easy to reject this peculiar band, with their rebellious images and obscure statements. But if you're brave enough to step out of your comfort zone you can very much appreciate Satanique Samba Trio's extravagant music. Badtriptych is original, different, innovative and venturous and is foremost well written art performed by extraordinary musicians. It's like one of those horrible coloured pieces of clothes, for example mustard yellow; at first it's hideous and stings your eyes. But with time -- when you got used to it, tried it on and worn it a few times, it turns into something interesting, cool and wearable -- just give it a chance and the right tools and it totally works!", "title": "Satanique Samba Trio 'Cliches 04, 21 & 23' [Far Out Recordings - Subtropical Psychedelia]", "publishedDate": "2014-01-28T17:14:12.000Z"}, {"_id": "-wwJ-rK10D0", "description": "Account Takeover is a significant threat to Financial Institutions today.
