Essentially he uncovered a method to beat shyness and social anxiety problem.\n\nRight after develop into outgoing and quiet popular, a few his old \"shy friends\" noticed the shift plus they almost all suggested he write a book about how exactly to overcome the issue, since he could be a walking and talking testimony that shyness and social anxiety indeed could be overcome.\n\nHence Sean Cooper wrote an incredible reserve called The Shyness and Social Anxiety System, this reserve is really a helpful reference to all or any those experiencing shyness and social anxiety. This is an established working blueprint.\n\n*tags*\nthe shyness and social anxiety workbook review\nthe shyness & social anxiety system -- sean cooper\nsean cooper social anxiety review\nsean cooper shyness review\nthe shyness and social anxiety system pdf\nthe shyness and social anxiety system ebook\nthe shyness and social anxiety system amazon\nthe shyness and social anxiety system download\n\nShyness And Social Anxiety System - Shyness And Social Anxiety System Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wYF67j9w8w", "title": "Shyness And Social Anxiety System - Shyness And Social Anxiety System Review", "publishedDate": "2014-06-22T09:47:21.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wYafD1rWf0", "description": "Will Anderson 'The Spider' Silva strike his way to the belt, or will current champ Chris Weidman get another win on the #1 pound-for-pound MMA fighter in the world?

Supporting this concept, intracerebral inoculation of synthetic recombinant \u03b1-synuclein fibrils can trigger \u03b1-synuclein pathology in mice. However, it remains uncertain whether the pathogenic effects of recombinant synthetic \u03b1-synuclein may apply to PD-linked pathological \u03b1-synuclein and occur in species closer to humans. Methods: Nigral LB-enriched fractions containing pathological \u03b1-synuclein were purified from post-mortem PD brains by sucrose gradient fractionation and subsequently inoculated into the substantia nigra or striatum of wild-type mice and macaque monkeys. Control animals received non-LB fractions containing soluble \u03b1-synuclein derived from the same nigral PD tissue. Results: In both mice and monkeys, intranigral or intrastriatal inoculations of PD-derived LB extracts resulted in progressive nigrostriatal neurodegeneration starting at striatal dopaminergic terminals. No neurodegeneration was observed in animals receiving non-LB fractions from the same patients. In LB-injected animals, exogenous human \u03b1-synuclein was quickly internalized within host neurons and triggered the pathological conversion of endogenous \u03b1-synuclein. At the onset of LB-induced degeneration, host pathological \u03b1-synuclein diffusely accumulated within nigral neurons and anatomically interconnected regions, both anterogradely and retrogradely. LB-induced pathogenic effects required both human \u03b1-synuclein present in LB extracts and host expression of \u03b1-synuclein. Interpretation: \u03b1-Synuclein species contained in PD-derived LB are pathogenic and have the capacity to initiate a PD-like pathological process, including intracellular and pre-synaptic accumulations of pathological \u03b1-synuclein in different brain areas and slowly progressive axon-initiated dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurodegeneration.", "title": "Lewy Body induced pathology in mice and monkeys", "publishedDate": "2013-12-20T09:26:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6waJjrpNKls", "description": "http://mouseandkey.com/ - It's the end of the World!....of Warcraft's Warlords of Draenor Beta (not quite that catchy is it).\n\nMusic used: September Sky by Per Kiilstofte\nhttps://machinimasound.com/music/september-sky\nLicensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)", "title": "WoD Beta End Event - GMs summon boss monsters in Azeroth!", "publishedDate": "2014-11-04T00:10:18.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wbKDbeSc7E", "description": "* maya software render.\n* 3d fluid container.\n* 2000000 Voxels.\n\nSYStem\n\ni5 quadcore 2.9ghz 2nd gen,\n6gb ram.\nnvidia GT9800", "title": "smoke trail experimental", "publishedDate": "2013-04-02T11:41:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wbYPdzF8Iw", "description": "", "title": "\u8525\u6cb9\u9905\u671f\u672b\u8003 008", "publishedDate": "2009-01-09T10:57:43.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wbZ238pTV0", "description": "Magical Moments", "title": "Magical Moments", "publishedDate": "2014-05-26T07:08:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wcC_C1U-TE", "description": "The Banker Masterclass with Christian Goerlach, Director, Cash Management FI Product.\nChristian Goerlach speaks to Michael Imeson of The Banker on Managing intraday liquidity in a changing regulatory environment\n \nChapter 1: Dodd-Frank, EMIR and Basel III -- what they mean for liquidity managers\n \nChapter 2: Collateral management and intraday liquidity management\n \nChapter 3: Central bank relationships: posting collateral versus depositing cash\n \nChapter 4: Mitigating the impact of regulation on liquidity management", "title": "Chapter 4: Mitigating the impact of regulation on liquidity management", "publishedDate": "2014-02-28T10:42:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wcDZ7sNxkA", "description": "Aerial footage of my alma mater - James Madison University.", "title": "JMU Campus", "publishedDate": "2014-08-06T21:42:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wcpZCHodA8", "description": "", "title": "Ring of Fire - Johnny Cash (Cover Na\u00edra Canella)", "publishedDate": "2013-05-31T00:47:55.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wd-XbfZSmg", "description": "escape from death: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6kg0lgmio\nuse magic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxQd_W3HElI\nTelefrag: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROYfe1ZQyHo\n\nPlayers: Bateman from Argentina\nJaba & Mrmatt from England\n\nI am looking for funny gameplay moments, epic fails from public server games, competitive games, tf2lobbies, mixes ,highlanders:)\n\nHow to submit demo files:\n\n1.

During his 2012 election campaign, Obama said he would give top priority to sweeping immigration reform in his second term.

He studied organ with Lagergren and composition with Dente at the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and then joined the faculty there, where he taught harmony (1908-24) and then organ (1924-45).[1] He was also the organist at the Gustav Vasa church in Stockholm. He became a member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Music in 1915.\n\nHe used his strong background in counterpoint, combined with an affinity for French organ music, to create his late Romantic style of composition. He also had an interest in earlier music and used the plainchant techniques of Gregorian chant in his Gregorianska melodier. He explored polytonality in his work, an advancement not found in other Swedish works of the time. In addition to many fine works for the organ, instrumental and choral works, his best-known work is his setting of the Te Deum, a large piece for chorus, string orchestra, harp, and organ.\n\nAs a teacher, he influenced many Swedish church musicians, and he was important in the development of church music in Sweden, which had suffered a long period of decline, having served as a member of official committees that supervised the liturgy and hymnology. He also composed Psalm settings for congregational use and wrote two instructional books, on the art of choral singing and psalm singing.", "title": "Otto Olsson - Tempus adest floridum (Choral) The Season of Flowers is Here (1/8)", "publishedDate": "2010-10-20T04:17:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wj7G_jBQvo", "description": "C\u00e1psula de Fernando Seri\u00f1\u00e1 Garza de la serie \"El Mundo en que Vivimos\", transmitida por Multimedios TV, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico.

Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 (cover-datedAug. 1962). Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crimefighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention (which he called \"web-shooters\"), and react to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat his foes.\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school student behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" young readers could relate.[3] Unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that \"with great power there must also come great responsibility\"\u2014a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but laterretroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.\n\"Snow White\" is a German fairy tale known across much of Europe and is today one of the most famous fairy tales worldwide. The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection Grimms' Fairy Tales. It was titled in German: Sneewittchen (in modern orthography Schneewittchen) and numbered as Tale 53. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854, Snow White is a fictional character and a main character from Walt Disney Productions' 1st animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The character of Snow White was derived from a fairy tale known from many countries in Europe, the best-known version being the Bavarian one collected by the Brothers Grimm. Snow White is the first Disney Princess and the first fictional female character with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nThis video is fair use under U.S. copyright law because it is noncommercial and transformative in nature, uses no more of the original than necessary, and has no negative effect on the market for the original work\nIF YOU LIKE THIS VIDEO PLEASE GIVE IT A RATE,OR COMMENT THIS WILL HELP ME A LOT.\nSUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL(3LAMESTUDIO)BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE POSTING MORE VIDEOS.\nTHANK YOU!\nthe music is from youtube creation tools", "title": "Spiderman vs Snow White", "publishedDate": "2014-10-15T15:49:27.000Z"}, {"_id": "6wmzNQslARg", "description": "***HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE***\n\nLeave a like if you enjoyed! :)\n\nCONNECT WITH ME!\n\nTwitch - http://www.twitch.tv/jevffa\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/FaZeJev\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/mrjeverson#\n\nCheck out TGN!\nhttp://tgn.tv/", "title": "THIRST!

The Giants quickly announced that Cruz had suffered a torn patellar tendon. He's been admitted to a Philadelphia hospital and will stay overnight. \n\nCruz suffered the injury while leaping to make a touchdown reception with 9:35 to play in the third quarter. The ball passed through Cruz's hands and he grabbed at his knee before he landed on the turf.

It's a crushing blow to a Giants offense that has leaned hard on Cruz as the team's best wide receiver the past three years.\n\nCruz's absence will change the Giants' offense and necessitate bigger contributions from Rueben Randle and first-round pick Odell Beckham.

In this video I will be talking a bit about Intonation. I will post 4 short videos on intonation within the next week. The full video is available through the 12 week online Pronunciation Pro Training Program. Subscribe to this channel then go over to \nhttps://pronunciationpro.com/signup and sign up for 1 Free week of English Pronunciation Training.\n\nNow for a little info about Intonation:\nIntonation is part of learning the correct Rhythm of English. Using the correct rhythm is a key part of speaking any language. It's not just about saying all the correct sounds of a language but we need to understand how a language is supposed to flow. If you learn how to use the correct rhythm of English you will find that your listener will easily follow what you are saying. \n\nI hope this helps. Leave comments and questions below and I'll see you again in the next video.\n\n--Annie Ruden M.S. CCC-SLP\n\nTranscript:\n\"The skill we are going to learn and practice today is Intonation. \nIntonation is the use of pitch. Pitch is the rising and lowering of your voice. Intonation is often called the music or melody of speech. So think of it in terms of singing. When you sing your voice goes higher for the high notes and lower for the low notes. I'd demonstrate but I'm not a very good singer.\nIn English, we do the same thing with our voice while we are speaking. We can go high in our pitch or we can go low. Did you hear the pitch change in my voice when I said that sentence? I'll say it again, we can go high in our pitch or we can go low. Hopefully you can hear that pitch change. Sometimes the pitch changes in English feel like a wave pattern or a roller coaster as it goes up and down and up and down. I've heard people imitate English speakers by saying \"dadaDAddaddaDada DAdada\".  This is actually a pretty good imitation because what they are imitating is the intonation pattern of English.\"", "title": "American English Intonation (1of4)", "publishedDate": "2012-09-04T22:13:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xA5neTHuDE", "description": "Update and challenge 30-90 days drinking 3-4 cups a day preferably before meals.

I am not going to stop drinking the tea after my desired weight is met I will cut down to 1-2 cups a day like I had done before. I look forward to seeing your comments and feel free to ask questions.\n\nGo! Team Oolong many of you have come along the journey with me for years. Thanks so much. #teamoolong\n\nUpdate: 4/16/2014 I have created: \nInstagram @TeamOolong\nTwitter: @TeamOolongTea \nCheck out the Tea for Tee Trendy (T-shirt) TeamOolong T-shirt (I designed it myself lol) http://teespring.com/teamoolong  *** They glitched my design they are fixing it 4/18/2014 its supposed to be a matching tea leaf in brown in the center of that cup :( \n***\n\n(*correctional I adjusted my scale my kids had messed with it. I reweighed myself several days at the same time of day I was 150lbs, I reached my goal 10lbs and actually more now I think maybe I will go for 5 more lbs then I am done) \n\nNOTES and Common Q& A:\n\nWill it help me lose weight fast? NO, it gradually should so Consistency & Time is key. It worked best after 30days in my 2nd and 3rd months.\n\nCan you sweeten it ? YES I used regular sugar & sometimes honey.\n\nCan you drink more than 4 cups a day? Yes but I do not suggest too much more there can be weight loss too much too fast I think its better gradual. \n\nWhen to drink, preferably before meals up to an hour before it does not matter extremely I was not consistent on 1 hour before maybe 30 minutes sometimes only a few minutes before.\n\nSleep after just drinking a cup NO lol it gives you Energy and will keep you up.\n\nBrand does not matter much but make sure the type is Oolong Tea aka Wulang Tea aka Dragon Tea. ( I will be using China Classic Oolong Tea by Foojoy box of 100 tea bags cost apprx 5-7 dollars)\n\nIt may make you urinate on a higher frequency similar to when you drink plenty of water. \n\nDoes FooJoy Company Pay Me? NO lol but it would be cool. ( Its Oolong Tea in general brand is not important, I just seem to like this brand)\n\n \n******Results may vary and I hope this is helpful to you as it has really been for me. Research this tea and decide if you want to add this to your daily life*******  \n\nBrand does not matter much but make sure the type is Oolong Tea aka Wulang Tea aka Dragon Tea.  \n\nI will be using China Classic Oolong Tea by Foojoy box of 100 tea bags cost apprx 5-7 dollars", "title": "Oolong Tea Weight Loss Challenge 30-90days", "publishedDate": "2014-02-14T06:10:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xATxQNaZgc", "description": "www.Larcom.net\n\n\u56fd\u7acb\u7af6\u6280\u5834\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u591a2Days16\u4e07\u4eba\u52d5\u54e1\uff01\u6b74\u53f2\u7684\u306a\u516c\u6f14\u3092\u6620\u50cf\u5316\uff01\n\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u3068\u306a\u308b4K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3001\u64ae\u5f71\u3055\u308c\u305f\u58ee\u5927\u306a\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30bf\u30af\u30eb\uff01\n\n2014\u5e743\u670821\u65e5\u300122\u65e5\u306b\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u3001\u56fd\u7acb\u7af6\u6280\u5834\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u591a2Days16\u4e07\u4eba\u52d5\u54e1\u3002\n360\u5ea6\u5ba2\u5e2d\u3092\u958b\u653e\u3057\u3001100\u53f0\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3088\u308b\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30de\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u3084\u89b3\u5ba2\u306b\u914d\u3089\u308c\u305f8\u4e07\u500b\u306eLED\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308b\u58ee\u5927\u306a\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30bf\u30af\u30eb\u3092\u6f14\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u6b74\u53f2\u306b\u6b8b\u308b\u516c\u6f14\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3082\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u3068\u306a\u308b20\u53f0\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b4K\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3082\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u64ae\u5f71\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\nBlu-ray / DVD\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u7523\u9650\u5b9a\u76e4\u306b\u306f\u3001\u53f2\u4e0a\u521d\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u5316\u3068\u306a\u308b4K\u30c0\u30a4\u30b8\u30a7\u30b9\u30c8\u6620\u50cf\u3092\u53ce\u9332\u3057\u305fL\u2019Arc\uff5een\uff5eCiel Original UEB\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u3092\u540c\u68b1\u3002\n\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3001\u30e9\u30a4\u30f4\u97f3\u6e90\u5168\u66f2\u3092\u53ce\u9332\u3057\u305fBlu-spec CD2\uff082\u679a\u7d44\uff09\u4ed8\u3002", "title": "L'Arc\uff5een\uff5eCiel\u3000\u300eL'Arc\uff5een\uff5eCiel LIVE 2014 at \u56fd\u7acb\u7af6\u6280\u5834 -Trailer Long Ver.-\u300f", "publishedDate": "2014-10-31T03:00:01.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xAZGDtCfWU", "description": "Hope you guys enjoy this episode!!

My tip is to make sure that the boutonniere and corsage for you and your date are planned accordingly. My tip is that you bring your date with you to pick out the flowers and make sure everything  matches your dress and that the match each other more importantly and that your date likes them as well. And a lot of girls actually complain about how the corsage feels on their wrists so a tip that I have is to pin the corsage to your purse or clutch as a little accessory.

When we're young, we often expect our stomachs and digestive systems to be able to handle any food that we throw at it, but often, when people get older, the notice that certain foods start to affect them in a negative way. If you've been experiencing indigestion symptoms, it's important to know that you don't have to live with them forever. Acid indigestion symptoms are common, but once they're spotted, they can be treated with natural means.\n\nWhat Are Common Symptoms of Indigestion?\n\nBecause different people will all experience different indigestion symptoms, it can be hard to say just what will let you know that you're suffering from this common health disorder. In most cases the acid indigestion symptoms that you experience will only be temporary, and may not occur every time you eat. Most symptoms of indigestion listed below are triggered by eating certain types of food that don't agree with your digestive system. Common acid indigestion symptoms are:\n\n\u2022 Burning in the stomach or upper abdomen\n\u2022 Abdominal pain\n\u2022 Bloating\n\u2022 Feeling full right after you start eating\n\u2022 Belching\n\u2022 Flatulence\n\u2022 Nausea\n\u2022 Vomiting\n\u2022 Acidic taste in your mouth\n\u2022 Growling stomach\n\nIt's also important to note that people suffering from regular symptoms of indigestion might notice that these things intensify when they are under increased amounts of stress. It's also important to point out that while heartburn might accompany indigestion, it is a sign of a completely different problem.\n\nWho Is At Risk For Indigestion Symptoms?\n\nMany people seem to think that indigestion symptoms are something that only affects men in their later adult years, but this is simply a social assumption that really has no merit. Truth be told, males and females of all ages are able to develop symptoms of indigestion. Drinking large amounts of alcohol, taking over the counter drugs such as aspirin, emotional problems like stress or depression, and poor digestive health can all be triggers for symptoms of indigestion.\n\nWhat Causes Acid Indigestion Symptoms?\n\nIf you're noticing that indigestion symptoms are becoming a regular part of your life, you might be wondering what could be causing this constant discomfort during and after meal times. Because it is one of the most common health complaints among adults all around the world, you probably won't be surprised to learn that there are a myriad of causes for indigestion symptoms. Some of the more common triggers for symptoms of indigestion include:\n\n\u2022 Ulcers\n\u2022 Irritable bowel syndrome\n\u2022 Pregnancy\n\u2022 Certain painkillers and antibiotics\n\u2022 Cigarette Smoking\n\u2022 Stress and anxiety\n\u2022 Overeating, eating too quickly, eating foods that are high in fat, or eating when you're stressed\n\nUsing Probiotics to Calm Symptoms of Indigestion\n\nBecause digestive health is so important to making sure that your body can properly process the food that you give it, it's imperative to make sure that you're taking a daily probiotic supplement to combat the symptoms of indigestion you're experiencing. A daily probiotic supplement will help maintain your digestive system and improve your overall health including less urgency and lesser digestive upsets.\n http://EzineArticles.com/5214834\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Wikiheartburn\nhttp://youtu.be/6xLCq0Nms4s", "title": "How to Spot Indigestion Symptoms", "publishedDate": "2014-09-17T12:45:52.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xLDLT425og", "description": "This is my devotion to Teeline shorthand, the love of my life and still an essential requirement for all UK journalists-in-training.

There are several FDA-approved medications that can be used, one of which is Minoxidil which is a topical preparation that can be used for both men and women and is often applied twice a day to the scalp. It often is most effective in the back area of the head or the crown. The second medical therapy is Finasteride more commonly known as Propecia; this can only be taken by men; it's a pill that you use once daily and it, too, seems to be more effective for regrowing some hair on the back part of the head. Most of the time in clinical practice we see that these products halt the hair loss, and that's still a positive thing since the hair loss that's genetically inclined is progressive and gets worse over time. Sometimes we get regrowth and it thickens the hair. The most effective treatment for regrowing hair is actually to transfer hair -- to move hair from the back which is not programmed to continue to bald and we move that hair to the front and top where the areas are thinning and that's the natural solution. There are also some therapy treatments with low-level light therapy, laser therapy, in the form of a comb as well as a cap. This can be helpful in conjunction with transplant therapy or the medical therapy as well.", "title": "How to Regrow a Hairline | Thinning Hair", "publishedDate": "2012-09-17T09:13:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xPNJemr57w", "description": "Hey guys kus here this is luke 1v1ing ropeadope after saying luke was bad at pvp and he was better.", "title": "Luke000150 1v1's Ropeadope", "publishedDate": "2013-12-13T08:11:31.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xPe-QAgjPY", "description": "10 lbs Catfish ate 4 foot water snake", "title": "100 3736", "publishedDate": "2009-07-08T16:44:35.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xPk97KkRaE", "description": "Jeron Teng & Jeric Teng ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nJeric Teng\nJeron Teng\nJeric & Jeron Teng\nJeric Teng & Jeron Teng\nIce bucket challenge\nALS Ice bucket challenge\nJeric Teng Ice bucket challenge\nJeric Teng ALS Ice bucket challenge\nJeron Teng Ice bucket challenge\nJeron Teng ALS Ice bucket challenge\nJeric & Jeron Teng Ice bucket challenge\nJeric & Jeron Teng ALS Ice bucket challenge\nJeric Teng Jeron Teng Ice Bucket Challenge\nJeric Teng Jeron Teng ALS Ice Bucket Challenge", "title": "Jeric & Jeron Teng Ice Bucket Challenge", "publishedDate": "2014-08-24T08:54:48.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xPqP6rwPbg", "description": "Siga por aqui:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ComitePopularCopaRJ\nhttp://rio.portalpopulardacopa.org.br/\n_________________________________________________\n\nVoc\u00ea sabia que o governo do estado t\u00e1 querendo vender o Maracan\u00e3 pro Eike Batista em uma das transa\u00e7\u00f5es mais criminosas da hist\u00f3ria?\n\n\u00c9 um esc\u00e2ndalo: desde 1999, foi investido cerca de R$ 1,5 BILH\u00c3O de nosso dinheiro no Maraca.

Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck) is a successful L.A. advertising executive who has a way with the ladies, but inside he longs for a meaningful long-term relationship. One day Buddy sells his seat on a sold-out airline flight to a stranger; he's shocked when the jet crashes and the man is killed. A year later, still haunted by the incident, Buddy looks up Abby Janello (Gwyneth Paltrow), the victim's widow, who is now selling real estate to support her children. Buddy soon finds himself attracted to Abby, and the feeling is mutual, but while he's interested in marriage, he isn't sure how (or if) he should tell her that he was indirectly responsible for her husband's death. Bounce was written and directed by Don Roos, who made a splash with his independent debut The Opposite of Sex; supporting Affleck and Paltrow are Natasha Henstridge, Jennifer Grey, David Paymer, and Joe Morton.\n\nbounce,\"bounce clip\",\"bounce calvin harris\",\"bounce it biggity\",\"bounce timbaland\",\"bounce that webbie\",\"ben affleck\",\"gwyneth paltrow\",\"don roos\",\"phone videos\",\"telephone videos\",\"romantic dramas\",romance,\"harvey weinstein\",\"bob weinstein\",\"steve golin\",\"meryl poster\",\"alan c blomquist\",\"bobby cohen\",\"bob osher\",\"michael besman\",\"confidence videos\",\"faith videos\",\"self control videos\",\"house videos\",\"buddy amaral\",\"abby janello\",\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V+++187121,/m/0151w_,/m/0bq2g", "title": "Bounce (4/10) Movie CLIP - Inexperienced (2000) HD", "publishedDate": "2011-10-01T01:42:59.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xSp8gHfhTw", "description": "GoPro Video of catching Brown's on the Middle Provo in UT during the Mother's Day Caddis hatch.", "title": "GoPro Fly Fishing on the Middle Provo in Utah", "publishedDate": "2014-05-21T04:34:44.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xT6duunRPw", "description": "", "title": "Eye Alertness Training 1 in QUEZON MEMORIAL CIRCLE", "publishedDate": "2013-09-08T04:47:36.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xTP-3mrbWY", "description": "A Ray Lewis themed light shot on the side of the Marriott Waterfront in Harbor East.\n\nCheck out my Flickr...\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/patgavin/\n\nTumblr...\nhttp://patgavin.tumblr.com/", "title": "Ray Lewis Light Show at Baltimore's Marriott Waterfront in Harbor East", "publishedDate": "2013-01-12T04:57:10.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xTx80MYN2c", "description": "", "title": "Phacelia's Camera Dec 2011 047", "publishedDate": "2012-01-20T21:42:40.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xURVbL4SHY", "description": "Spot sobre o livro \"O castelo\".", "title": "\"O castelo\"", "publishedDate": "2006-09-15T03:31:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xUewDN9lgY", "description": "EICMA 2014, the Legend returns.

Henry Thomas plays Elliott, a young boy living with his single mother (Dee Wallace), his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Elliott often seems lonely and out of sorts, lost in his own world. One day, while looking for something in the back yard, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. And he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the \"little squashy guy,\" perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him. In 2002, Steven Spielberg re-released E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial in a revised edition, with several deleted scenes restored and digitally refurbished special effects.\n\n\"e.t. the extra-terrestrial\",\"drew barrymore\",\"henry thomas\",\"wig videos\",\"ages 11-12\",\"ages 8-10\",blockbusters,\"children family\",\"family drama\",\"family sci-fi fantasy\",tearjerkers,\"steven spielberg\",\"melissa mathison\",\"friendship videos\",\"bedroom videos\",\"house videos\",elliott,gertie,\"movie clips\",movieclipsdotcom,#AMG:V++++15032,/m/0462b0,/m/026c1", "title": "E.T.

The origins and history  of the IRS shows just how in error these beliefs are. Not only is there no law that requires most Americans to file an individual tax return, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wasn't even created by an act of Congress! \nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States of America, in pertinent part, provides that:   \n\n \". . . direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons . . . three-fifths of all other Persons.\"\n In 1894, Congress passed a law which purportedly imposed a \"direct income tax\" on the Citizens of the several States within this Union, but failed to make any provision for apportionment, as required by Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States of America. In the case of Pollack vs. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., US (1895), the U.S. Supreme Court struck the law down, as being unconstitutional, because it failed to make any provision for apportionment, as required by Article I, Section 2, Clause 3. \nThereafter, Congress passed the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was \"declared\" to have been ratified in 1913. The Sixteenth Amendment provides that:   \n\"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\" \n The Constitutionality of the Sixteenth Amendment was challenged in the case of Brushaber vs. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 240 US 1 (1916). The U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged the apparent conflict between Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, of the Constitution, which required all direct taxes to be apportioned, and the Sixteenth Amendment, which appeared to eliminate the apportionment requirement. The Court pointed out that the Sixteenth Amendment did not repeal Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, but noted that it was under a duty to uphold the Sixteenth Amendment, if it could be interpreted in such a way so as to eliminate the conflict. The Court did hold the Amendment constitutional, but only because it interpreted the Amendment as applying only to \"indirect taxes\" or \"excise taxes\", and not to \"direct taxes\". Brushaber and other cases that followed, stated that the Sixteenth Amendment did not give Congress any new or additional taxing powers that it did not already have, but merely put into written form the state of the law as it previously existed. \n\nhttp://www.afn.org/~govern/IRSkinny.html", "title": "Greta Van Sustern on the IRS", "publishedDate": "2013-11-09T20:11:41.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xhLNcQESoU", "description": "A Assassin who is against Liberality has a plan to kill Ahmed Dogan Today, Hes gun doesnt worked so, Ahmed Dogan didn`t died.

Er ist ein Berg- oder Riesenmammutbaum (Sequoiadendron giganteum) und steht im Giant Forest des Sequoia-Nationalparks im US-Bundesstaat Kalifornien. Sein Alter wird auf etwa 1900 bis 2500 Jahre gesch\u00e4tzt.\n\nAusma\u00dfe:\n\nDer General Sherman Tree ist mit einer Stammh\u00f6he von \"nur\" 83,8 m nicht der h\u00f6chste Baum der Erde, das ist mit einer Stammh\u00f6he von 115,55 m der K\u00fcstenmammutbaum (Sequoia sempervirens) Hyperion im Redwood-Nationalpark. Auch Douglasien (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Sitka-Fichten (Picea sitchensis) und Riesen-Eukalyptuse (Eucalyptus regnans) k\u00f6nnen mitunter deutlich h\u00f6her werden. Es ist auch nicht der dickste Baum, das ist der \u00c1rbol del Tule, eine mexikanische Sumpfzypresse, der aber niedriger ist.\n\nDie charakteristische Eigenschaft des General Sherman Tree, der einen Brusth\u00f6hendurchmesser von 825 Zentimetern besitzt ist, dass er auch im weiteren Stammverlauf hohe Durchmesser beibeh\u00e4lt. Eine Bestimmung des Volumens dieses massiven Baumes ergab im Jahr 1975 einen Wert von 1486,6 Kubikmetern, eine neuere Bestimmung sogar 1489 Kubikmeter.\n\nDamit handelt es sich um den volumin\u00f6sesten lebenden Baum und die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Pflanze der Erde. Zuweilen wird er gar als \u201egr\u00f6\u00dftes Lebewesen der Erde\" (Largest Living Thing on Earth) bezeichnet, dies ist aber nicht korrekt, denn das ist ein Pilz der Art Armillaria ostoyae im Malheur National Forest, Oregon mit einer Ausdehnung von ungef\u00e4hr 965 ha.\n\nAnfang 2006 verlor der Baum w\u00e4hrend eines Wintersturmes einen gro\u00dfen Ast, der beim Herabst\u00fcrzen Teile der Absperrungen um den Baum zerst\u00f6rte und einen Krater in die angelegten Fu\u00dfwege riss. Der Verlust des Astes \u00e4ndert nicht die Stellung des Baumes als gr\u00f6\u00dfter aller B\u00e4ume, weil die Volumina nur f\u00fcr die St\u00e4mme ohne \u00c4ste gemessen werden.\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Sherman_Tree", "title": "Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Baum der Welt", "publishedDate": "2013-09-19T16:26:06.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xmDzDSAa2c", "description": "", "title": "Medusozoa @ Film-Com 2014", "publishedDate": "2014-06-21T18:58:32.000Z"}, {"_id": "6xmJVIoJmp4", "description": "Being an authorized user can help your credit score, but it can also hurt it.

I\u2019m a 57 lb. spayed female Pit Bull mix who is just over 1 year old. I have a short, sleek coat that is mostly tan with some wisps of white here and there and beautiful dark eyes. As my name suggests I\u2019m a big sweetheart who loves meeting (and cuddling with) new people! I\u2019m very energetic and playful, and I adore spending time in the yard chasing after toys. I enjoy going on walks with my favorite person, especially to the beach, and I\u2019m even partially house trained! The shelter\u2019s time and experience with me tells them that I would greatly benefit from obedience training, therefore it is required of my new family. I would prefer to go to a home without small children that has some experience with cool canines like me. I get along great with male dogs as long as we\u2019re supervised, but no cats please! If you have children or resident pets, please ask an adoption counselor if we\u2019d make a good match. Please ask for Sweets, and use my special ID number A570611 when you do.

And it's just as much of a wreck in the 21st century for at least three reasons:\n\n1. The lowball costs. CNN estimates that delivering on the plan could cost well over $500 billion and take decades to build, all while failing to cover much of the country at all. Internationally, only two high-speed rail lines have recouped their capital costs and all depend on huge subsidies to stay in operation.\n\n2. The supposed benefits. \"We're gonna be taking cars off of congested highways and reducing carbon emissions,\" says Vice President Joe Biden, an ardent rail booster. But most traffic jams are urban, not inter-city, so high-speed rail between metro areas will have no effect on your daily commute. And when construction costs are factored in, high-speed rail \"may yield only marginal net greenhouse gas reductions,\" say UC-Berkeley researchers.\n\n3. The delusional Amtrak example. Obama and Biden look to Amtrak as precedent, but since its founding in 1971, the nation's passenger rail system has sucked up almost $35 billion in subsidies and, says The Washington Post's Robert J. Samuelson, \"a typical trip is subsidized by about $50.\" About 140 million Americans shlep to work every day, while Amtrak carries just 78,000 passengers. There's no reason to think that high-speed rail will pump up those numbers, though there's every reason to believe its costs will grow and grow.\n\n\"Supertrain 2010\" was written and produced by Meredith Bragg and Nick Gillespie, who also hosts.

Roman poets placed them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalised traditions, the literal geography of the \"flowery\" island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.

The soldiers are extremely tired, returning from battle, when a gas attack happens.  Owen describes the harrowing events that unfold.  The title (Latin) means \"it is sweet and right\". \n\nWilfred Owen is recognised as one of the greatest World War One poets.  'Dulce et Decorum Est' is arguably Wilfred Owen's most famous anti-war poem.  The line \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\" is Latin and translates, 'it is sweet and right to die for your country'. It derives from Horace's Odes (III.2.13) -- a Roman lyrical poet.  \n\nThe annotation prompts are a supportive tool, intended to encourage further analysis and interpretation.  \n\nFor poetry essay support, please check out Poetry Essay app: http://appstore.com/poetryessay\n\nFor daily poetry news and essay support, please visit: http://www.poetryessay.co.uk", "title": "Wilfred Owen - 'Dulce et Decorum Est' - Annotation", "publishedDate": "2013-04-13T15:51:22.000Z"}, {"_id": "6y7jTdx3VGA", "description": "Me singing Animaniacs.

The name Delije first began to be used by hardcore Red Star supporters during late 1980s, with official inauguration taking place on 7 January 1989. Up to that point, the die hard Red Star fans were scattered amongst about eight fan groups that shared the north stand at the Red Star Stadium (known colloquially as Marakana), most prominent of which were Red Devils, Zulu Warriors and Ultras.\nDelije organizational structure is fairly decentralized with many subgroups present at the stadium's north stand - the gathering point of the club's most loyal and passionate fans. At any given time, one or two subgroups assert themselves as the most prominent through dedication, regular attendance, willingness to fight, etc. and as a result get to hang their banners on the most visible parts of the stand, their leaders get to lead the chants, etc. Currently, the subgroup Belgrade Boys enjoys the greatest clout while others such as Ultra Boys, Brigate, Heroes, Ultras etc. also wield a lot of influence. In the past, subgroups such as Padina Corps, Fontana, etc. have all left their mark. Since Red Star enjoys a lot of support outside of Belgrade as well, various fan groups exist in cities across Serbia, Montenegro, and Republika Srpska.Those groups are Nislije(Nis,third biggest city in Serbia),Kopre Nedri(Republika Srpska,and the name of tre group was formed after several groups from Republika Srpska joined together,naiming the group that on rough English would sound,across the Drina),and from Montenegro there are several groups named after cities from which they come.\nAs a sign of appreciation, during the late 1990s, Red Star Football Club painted the word Delije in block letters across their stadium's north stand. Since the mid 1980s Red Star's most devoted fans maintain friendly relations with Olympiacos CFP ultras - a friendship based on common Orthodox faith and same club colours. Since the mid 2000s FC Spartak Moscow fans are also included in this friendship.\n\n\u0414\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u0458\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u045a\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0424\u0443\u0434\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430. \u0414\u043e \u0443\u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u045a\u0435\u045a\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b 7. \u0458\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0430 1989. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0452\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0441\u0443 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0443 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0458\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e \u201e\u0414\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\".\n\u0414\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0443 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0435; \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0458\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0435 \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0443: Belgrade boys, Brigate, Ultra Boys i Heroes.\n\u041d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u0426\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435 \u0438 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0443 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e. \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u201e\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u045b\u0430\" (\u201eOrthodox Brothers\"). \u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u0426\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0443 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0442\u0430\u043a\u043c\u0438\u0446\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u045a\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0432\u0435\u045b\u0435\u0433 \u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0424\u041a \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0430. \u041e\u0434 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u201eOrthodox Brothers\" \u0441\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0443\u043a\u0459\u0443\u0447\u0443\u0458\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435.\n\n\n\nSerbian Ultras / Delije / Red Star Belgrad / Belgrad / Serbia", "title": "DELIJE. ..

According to Finnish folklore, stretching back to the 19th century, it was his method of testing aspiring members of his gang by forcing them to lug sacks of grain or live animals over a similar course.\n\nAnother theory is that it stems from an even earlier tribal practice of wife-stealing.

A staple in Jamie\u2019s sets at the moment and always creating a major impact on the dance floor, \u2018Dogfish\u2019 is testament to Filsonik\u2019s nuanced production skills and flair for a killer groove and a ridiculously infectious swagger. Ever in demand, master remixer Jamie draws upon his classic persuasion for free styling wonkiness and rowdy basslines on the B side. Warping the origibal into darker territory and bleeping the beats into submission. Expect to hear bother version everywhere this summer.\n\nFilsonik career as a producer started in 2006 under the wing of New York\u2019s veteran house DJ Timmy Regisford of Club Shelter, a legendary weekly house night that ran for fifteen years. Co-productions with Regisford on Shelter\u2019s label Unrestricted Tracks and Restricted Tracks showcased Filsonik\u2019s sound. Fast forward to 2014 and Filsonik is still a close collaborator with fellow NYC Puerto Rican artists, uniting with The Martinez Brothers and Point G for the massive \u2018What\u2019s The Point?\u2019 on Ever Lasting LOVE.\n\nJamie Jones, label head of the pioneering Hot Creations imprint, mastermind behind the decks and one fourth of the Hot Natured is still on top of his game and one of the best loved DJs on the circuit.

Fue lanzado como sencillo en enero de 1987, alcanzando el puesto #12 en el UK Singles Chart. Como era a menudo en el caso de los sencillos de The Smiths, no apareci\u00f3 en un \u00e1lbum de estudio original. Se puede encontrar en las recopilaci\u00f3nes Louder Than Bombs, Singles y The World Won't Listen.\nOtra canci\u00f3n reci\u00e9n terminada, \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\", fue originalmente destinada a ser el lado A de este sencillo. El sencillo aun lleg\u00f3 a la prueba de etiqueta blanca de prensado y aproximadamente 900 ejemplares de las acciones individuales fueron fabricados. Esta mezcla \u00fanica abortada, se puede escuchar en la compilaci\u00f3n del Reino Unido The World Won't Listen, mientras que la canci\u00f3n fue remezclada para la compilaci\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Louder Than Bombs.\nEl t\u00edtulo alude a la consigna comunista de \"\u00a1Proletarios de todos los pa\u00edses, un\u00edos!\". Se ha dicho que la canci\u00f3n es acerca de la homosexualidad. Este es tal vez debido a la similitud entre la palabra \"shoplifter\" (ladr\u00f3n de comercios) y la palabra \"shirtlifter\" (literalmente, \u00ablevantacamisas\u00bb), un t\u00e9rmino usado para un hombre homosexual en el Reino Unido.\nDurante una charla con Shaun Duggan, Morrissey explic\u00f3 el significado de la canci\u00f3n de la siguiente manera: \"Es m\u00e1s o menos un robo espiritual, hurto cultural, tomando las cosas y utilizandolas para su propia ventaja.\"\nMusicalmente, la canci\u00f3n tiene un gran parecido a la canci\u00f3n de T. Rex \"Children of the Revolution\". Tanto Morrissey y Johnny Marr son fans de Marc Bolan, y Marr ha admitido en una entrevista que la melod\u00eda de un sencillo anterior, \"Panic\", fue copiado de \"Metal Guru\". Tambi\u00e9n musicalmente suena como \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", de Thin Lizzy. Johnny Marr ha declarado su mucho amor por Phil Lynnott algunas veces.\nMorrissey ha dicho que esta es su canci\u00f3n favorita de The Smiths.

The bearings of the rollers are designed to deliver a pressure of 50 MPa or more. The bed of material drawn between the rollers emerges as a slab-like agglomeration of highly fractured particles. The energy efficiency of this process isparatively high. Systems have been designed, including a de-agglomerator and separator, that will deliver material of cement fineness. However, particle size distribution is again a problem, and roll presses are now increasingly popular as a \"pre-grind\" process, with the cement finished in a single chamber ball mill. This gives good cement performance, and reduces energy consumption by 20-40%pared with a standard ball mill system.\n\n Send EnquiryAddress: D- 62-67, Epip Site- V, Kasna, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201 306, India Mobile / Cell Phone:\u00a0 +(91)- Website: .cementplants.net/industrial-machineries.html\n\n Portland clinker is the main constituent of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add a certain amount of water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. \"Blended cements\" and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration. They include 1,2-propanediol, acetic acid, triethanolamine and lignosulfonates.", "title": "cement granding plant", "publishedDate": "2012-09-11T06:12:46.000Z"}, {"_id": "6yf6n8O0hzw", "description": "HI FOLKS, IT IS UNUSUAL TO SEE A DUSKY LANGUR ON THE GROUND.

DTG prefers to print on 100% cotton t-shirts for a crisp colofrul design..The ink is 100% water based and EPA friendly. No nasty chemicals like you would find from screenprinting plastisol inks. There are no screens involved so the setup process is very simple an inexpensive. This process is perfect if you have a webstore and wanting to sell multiple designs with small inventory on hand. Artists can be creative and sell their work online and be very profitable. If you are a geat artist or want to start a t-shirt line DTG is the way to go. You should first start by contracting the printing out and once your sales get to a high level, you can invest in your own printer.   Check out the video and if you have any questions about contracting your artwork out let us know at http://northwestembroidery.com.

Texaco was later acquired by Chevron.\n\nThe American oil firm has always maintained that it cleaned up the area before handing over the oil field to the Ecuadorean government.\n\nIt argued that it only lost the case because the legal team representing the villagers paid nearly $300,000 in bribes in Ecuador.\n\nUS district judge Lewis Kaplan in New York has now ruled that Steven Donziger's legal team used \"corrupt means\" to win the 2011 case.\n\nMr Kaplan described the evidence against Mr Donziger's team as \"voluminous\".\n\n\"Justice is not served by inflicting injustice,\" he wrote in the ruling. \"The ends do not justify the means. There is no 'Robin Hood' defence to illegal and wrongful conduct.\"\n\nChevron's chief executive, John Watson, hailed the ruling as \"a resounding victory for Chevron and its shareholders\".\n\nThe legal team representing the Ecuadorean villagers have also sued Chevron in Brazil, Argentina and Canada.\n\nBut Chevron believes the US judge decision will help them fight their case in other courts.\n\nSome 30,000 local residents, including five different Amazonian tribes, began the lawsuit against Texaco in 1993.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the oil company knowingly dumped 18bn gallons (68bn litres) of toxic waste water and spilled 17m gallons of crude oil into the rainforest during its operations in north-east Ecuador.\n\nThey say the affected area covers 4,400 sq km (1,700 sq miles) on the border with Colombia.\n\nLocal residents believe the pollution has led to health problems such as cancer and birth defects.", "title": "Ecuador oil ruling against Chevron Cancelled By Judge In The United States", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04T22:32:04.000Z"}, {"_id": "6ywYIk2lGeM", "description": "Produced by Pilot Films.", "title": "DJ Kent ft.

Here we use mechanical fatigue, well below rupture strength, to induce stepwise disruption of individual human adenovirus particles under physiological conditions, and simultaneously monitor disassembly in real time. Our data show the sequence of dismantling events in individual mature (infectious) and immature (noninfectious) virions, starting with consecutive release of vertex structures followed by capsid cracking and core exposure. Further, our experiments demonstrate that vertex resilience depends inextricably on maturation, and establish the relevance of penton vacancies as seeding loci for virus shell disruption. The mechanical fatigue disruption route recapitulates the adenovirus disassembly pathway in vivo, as well as the stability differences between mature and immature virions.", "title": "Disassembly of mature virus induced by mechanical fatigue with AFM", "publishedDate": "2013-03-20T15:49:42.000Z"}, {"_id": "6z11VNEgVl4", "description": "", "title": "Chris Jones - No Sanctuary Here", "publishedDate": "2013-04-03T10:01:24.000Z"}, {"_id": "6z1WdXsL8eQ", "description": "How does a Seagull Maritime sound ?

Kevin Knox of A Beautiful Ceremony demonstrates the address to the parents thanking them.  \n\nEach couple receives 3 free bonuses when working with A Beautiful Ceremony, Inc.: A free 'ceremony planning kit', a free name change kit, and a free online premarital course that will reduce the cost of your marriage license by $32.50.  \n\nHaving professional wedding officiants conduct your wedding vows will make a big difference in how your marriage vows come across to your guest. A professional justice of the peace wedding or wedding officiant will be able to conduct your wedding vows in a manner that is beautiful and sincere. The best wedding officiants have great stage presence and poise. Not everybody who wants to be a professional marriage officiant or justice of the peace is able to act the part. Not all wedding officiants are equal -- some wedding officiants are better than others. The most common mistake made by a rookie marriage officiant is not getting their eyes off of worship book while reading the wedding vows. The wedding vows is one of the most photographic moments of the ceremony so you wedding minister should be able to provide better eye contact for your guest. Many wedding officiants and justice of the peace weddings are performed at State parks or at hotel venues. In Orlando, Florida it's a common practice for wedding officiants or a wedding Minister to travel to your preferred location to perform your wedding vows.\n\nWedding officiant Rev. Kevin Knox and his team of other ministers are considered to be the most trusted and respected wedding officiant in Orlando Florida. His business \"A beautiful ceremony, Inc.\" is the only team of the wedding officiants that is on Disney's esteemed preferred vendor list. The team of marriage officiants has been awarded the Wedding Wire Bridal Choice Award for five consecutive years. This award recognizes that \"a beautiful ceremony, Inc.\" as being in the top 5% of all wedding ministers across the nation. Rev. Kevin has also written a book titled \"the best of the best wedding words\". This book is a collection of the most popular ceremonies, marriage vows, ring vows, readings and ceremony enhancements. This book is the inspiration for the \"ceremony planning kit\" that is offered to couples who work with Rev. Kevin.\n\nIf you're looking for a wedding officiant in Orlando Florida then Rev. Kevin Knox with a beautiful ceremony might be your solution. Finding the right wedding officiant is not an easy task. You want to make sure that your justice of the peace or Minister fits your own style and taste. That's one reason why Rev. Kevin Knox has been intentional in building a team of wedding ministers that can accommodate the different needs, traditions and beliefs of engaged couples. His business, \"a beautiful ceremony\" has a team of five ministers from different faiths and denominations. His wife, Teresa also performs weddings but does so as a notary or a justice of the peace. All of the marriage officiants perform a variety of ceremonies, including civil or nonreligious. Each couple upon inquiring with \"a beautiful ceremony Incorporated receives three bonuses. The first is a \"ceremony planning kit\". This allows couples to design the own ceremony based upon their own culture, tradition and beliefs. They can pick from one of three different ceremonies. The first is a traditional religious ceremony, the second is a warmer more contemporary wedding ceremony with religious touches while the third is a nonreligious or civil ceremony. The couples can then pick their own marriage vows, ring vows, readings and ceremony enhancements. The ceremony planning kit is over 50 pages long so it is very comprehensive in content.

If they're wearing long sleeves, roll or push them up. While you're doing this, explain why washing up after touching something dirty and before meals is important. \n\nTip\nSometimes a tot's arms can reach the water better if they stand to one side of the sink.\n\nStep 2: \nShow them how to turn on the cold water tap. Tell them that's the only one they're allowed to touch. If you want to make the water warmer, add in the hot yourself. If you have a single-tap faucet, turn on the water and set the temperature yourself.\n\nStep 3: \nHave your child hold both hands under the running water. If you're using bar soap, show your toddler how to roll it between both hands to make bubbles. If you have hand soap, some kids have trouble holding one hand under the pump while pressing down with the other, so you might have to help with this part.\n\nTip\nKid-friendly hand soaps in fun colors and scents will often entice little ones to wash up.\n\nStep 4: \nNow demonstrate the fine art of thorough scrubbing. Explain they must wash for 20 seconds to get rid of all the yucky germs. That's about the amount of time it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday Song\" twice through, so belt it out with them.\n\nTip\nDon't let the water run while your child is lathering up. They'll be tempted to rinse away the soap before they get their hands really clean.\n\nStep 5: \nTurn the faucet back on. Help your child rinse away the suds. Explain that it\u2019s all gone when his hands don\u2019t feel slippery anymore. Cover your fingers with a paper towel as you turn the faucet off to avoid germ transmission. Then, help your child dry their hands on the towel \u2013 and give them a hand!\n\nDid You Know?\nViruses and bacteria can live two hours or more on objects your kids come into contact with \u2013 from the playground swing to grocery carts.", "title": "How to Teach a Toddler to Wash Their Hands", "publishedDate": "2009-10-02T13:00:47.000Z"}, {"_id": "6z6qZgCnQg8", "description": "This time... helmet reactions, trolling kids, enthusiastic kids...\nAnd winter is coming!\nGUYS: Lets help Grant Keenan get a gopro3 silver!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/insuremyride?sk=app_651599898184995&app_data=/app/807/page/2061/element/4004/item/246946\n\n\nYou may need to: 1.

The genus has a largely Northern Hemisphere distribution, but is essentially cosmopolitan, being found in a variety of wetland habitats. These plants are known in British English as bulrush, bullrush, or reedmace,[1] in American English as cattail, punks, or corndog grass, and in New Zealand as raupo. Typha should not be confused with other plants known as bulrush, such as some sedges (mostly in Scirpus and related genera).\n\nTypha leaves are alternate and mostly basal to a simple, jointless stem that eventually bears the flowering spikes. The rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the surface of muddy ground to start new upright growth, and the spread of Typha is an important part of the process of open water bodies being converted to vegetated marshland and eventually dry land.\nTypha plants are monoecious and bear unisexual, wind-pollinated flowers, developing in dense spikes. The numerous male flowers form a narrow spike at the top of the vertical stem. Each male (staminate) flower is reduced to a pair of stamens and hairs, and withers once the pollen is shed. The very large numbers of tiny female flowers form a dense, sausage-shaped spike on the stem below the male spike \u2014 in larger species this can be up to 30 centimetres (12 in) long and 1 to 4 centimetres (0.39 to 1.6 in) thick. Seeds are minute, 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) long, and attached to a fine hair. When ripe the heads disintegrate into dense cottony fluff, from which the seeds disperse by wind. Typha is often among the first wetland plants to colonize areas of newly exposed wet mud; it also spreads by rhizomes, forming dense stands often to the exclusion of other plants.\n[edit]Species\n\nTypha angustifolia - Lesser Bulrush or Narrow Leaf Cattail\nTypha domingensis - Southern Cattail\nTypha \u00d7glauca (angustifolia \u00d7 latifolia) - Hybrid or White Cattail\nTypha latifolia - Common Cattail\nTypha laxmannii - Laxman's Bulrush\nTypha minima - Dwarf Bulrush\nTypha muelleri - Raupo\nTypha orientalis - Raupo\nTypha capensis - Cape bulrush\nTypha shuttleworthii - Shuttleworth's Bulrush\n\n\nTypha plants at the edge of a small wetland in Indiana.\nThe most widespread species is Typha latifolia, extending across the entire temperate northern hemisphere. T. angustifolia is nearly as widespread, but does not extend so far north; some believe it is introduced and invasive in North America. T. domingensis is a more southerly American species, extending from the U.S. to South America, while T. laxmannii, T. minima, and T. shuttleworthii are largely restricted to Asia and parts of southern Europe. Typha latifolia has also been recently introduced into fresh water creeks and lakes in Australia where the water is shallow and contains levels of dirty, turbid water. It affects the flow of the water and also filters the water and catches floating or submerged items, possibly damming the water flow.\nTypha plants grow along lake margins and in marshes, often in dense colonies, and are sometimes considered a weed in managed wetlands. The plant's root systems help prevent erosion, and the plants themselves are often home to many insects, birds and amphibians.", "title": "CATTAIL CUTTER machine from Weeders Digest to control cattails", "publishedDate": "2010-10-03T03:34:57.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zOZiGqzP90", "description": "", "title": "rahul making Bhang", "publishedDate": "2011-03-20T07:19:26.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zOoKa3k03I", "description": "SISTAR(\uc528\uc2a4\ud0c0) - Touch my body(\ud130\uce58\ub9c8\uc774\ubc14\ub514) Acoustic Ver. \nwith Ahn Jung Jae(\uc548\uc911\uc7ac)\n\n- Album Title : The 2nd Mini Album \"TOUCH N MOVE\"\n- Title Song : TOUCH MY BODY \n- Release date: 2014.07.21\n- Facebook SISTAR : http://www.facebook.com/officialsistar\n- Twitter SISTAR : http://www.twitter.com/sistarsistar\n\n-TRACK LIST-\n1.

The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an \"access bowl\", the successors to the BCS.\n\nFounded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.\n\nConnect with the ACCDigitalNetwork Online:\nVisit the ACC WEBSITE: http://theacc.com\nFollow the ACCDN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theACCDN\nFollow the ACCDN on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theACCDN\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ACCDigitalNetwork", "title": "Jacoby Brissett Supermans In For Six | ACC Must See Moment", "publishedDate": "2014-11-08T20:59:17.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zP9-QErJ0Y", "description": "Kamyon ve T\u0131r Kantarlar\u0131", "title": "Nevton T\u0131r Kantar\u0131 - Weighbridge", "publishedDate": "2012-04-14T11:30:39.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zPGefqoMtw", "description": "Duo on guitar, drums and gameboy.", "title": "E U C A R Y O T E - Grina - [April 7, 2011 - Amsterdam]", "publishedDate": "2011-04-09T19:06:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zPOeyhj1tc", "description": "Magic Boxer Shorts.

Now try to translate the sample sentences and excuse me for a moment until the end of the intro song!\n\nSo to start things off, here are three ways to say excuse me in Russian:\n\u0418\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f! \n\u0412\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442!\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435!\nMaking excuses and apologizing often go hand in hand and in sample sentence one we have a Russian word for to apologize:\n\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0443. (She apologized for her mistake.)\nThe focus word here is a form of \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c means to apologize, to excuse, to pardon, or to forgive. BTW, we see the past tense, feminine, reflexive form of this verb in the sample sentence and while \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c is the perfective form, the imperfective form of the verb is \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c, FYI.\n\nSample sentence two goes like this:\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e! (Sorry to bother you!)\nThe word of interest here is a form of \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c and \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c means to excuse or to forgive. While \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c is the perfective form, the imperfective form is \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0442\u044c as in \"\u042f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0430\u044e \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0434\u044b\" which means \"I forgive the offenses.\"\n\nThe third sample sentence is as follows:\n\u0425\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0438!

What has changed since I was a child?\n\nDo I really think for myself or do I repeat what I hear on television news media as fact? \n\nWhat is at stake?

Two out of three isn't bad but how did he know this?\n\nHe stated we would be fighting the invisible enemy of terrorism until our freedoms were gone and we would practically beg to be implanted with microchips for our safety delivering total control to the elite few.\n\nPlease do a search on YT for 'Matt Simmons BP oil spill' and you will see that he told the truth from the beginning putting BP executives at risk of going to jail. \nMatt Simmons was executed for this using a weapon available today know as the 'heart attack gun' which can also be searched on YT to reveal a gun that will shoot a tiny dart that will dissolve in the body, cause a heart attack, but will not show up in an autopsy.  \n\nDo we really know who is in control? Is the President of the United States the most powerful man on Earth or is he kept in line doing the work of the 'Shadow Government' rulers of the world. \n\nWhy do we use a Federal Reserve Monetary System controlled by German Banks who technically have been our enemy in previous world wars?\n\nWhat are the true implications of this? Why do we give our money to all these other developing nations, and who is behind this redistribution of America's wealth?\n\nWhat would change if the United States printed its own money and stopped using the Federal Reserve System which is a private corporation owned by European Banks?\n\nEverything previously stated is documented and available to you if you are willing to do the research.\n\nIt could only serve to benefit the U.S.A. and its true interests to print our own money so who and what keeps this control out of our hands and why?\n\nWhy does the US go bankrupt every 70 years and how could we possibly break free from this chain, and what keeps us and all our military might from doing so?\n\nWho's will are we really doing? Why did Deutsche Bank of Germany receive all of the money used to bail out AIG?\n\nWhat would happen to the power of the banks if businesses far and wide adopted a policy of accepting silver for payment of goods and services and relied less on fiat currency backed by nothing since 1971? These so called U.S. Dollars that aren't truly United States Notes?  \n\nWhat could be possible if all in the 911 truth movement decided to focus their energy on what is coming ahead of us rather than what has happened behind us?\n\nIt is only looking forward that you have a choice to make preparations and do something about anything as the past cannot be changed and is likely to continue to be incorrectly documented for our children to be indoctrinated with.", "title": "INDOCTRINATION - Chimpanzee versus Child.

I suggest that you use headphones while watching it.'\n\nCatholic Church priest Marek Dunda, confirmed that the alleged exorcism was genuine, but declined to comment further saying: 'If something is filmed through a keyhole, there is nothing more to say about it.'\n\nHe explained he couldn't comment in more detail about what exactly happened beyond the door.\n\n'We were asking God to protect and to liberate the person. We used a Latin prayer asking for a help. Of course it helps. '\n\nThe exorcist also declined to reveal the identity of the woman, saying details about her condition.\n\nHowever locals are unhappy about the exorcism ritual is being carried out in the church, saying that the noises from those affected including shouting and screaming was terrifying\n\nIveta Pecharova said: 'I don't agree with it. It has happened more than once and the noise has been heard very far from the church.'\n\nMarie Brozkova said: 'I am a believer, I go to church and I believe that if our priest does it then it must be right.'\n\nMayor of the town of Vranov nad Dyji said: 'I have asked about it.

She gets a bed, and they get sex with a side of arm candy. She thinks that it\u2019s a foolproof, budget-friendly way to fund her excursion.\n\nThe ad reportedly describes the ideal that She\u2019s looking for \u2018temporary boyfriends\u2019 who must be \u2018good looking, under 30, taller than 1.75 metres and, of course, rich\u2019.\n\nJu Said:\n\nHe will fund my transport to their city and all my expenses while I am there and they need to be generous. In return, they get a whole night with me, my undivided attention, and a chance to show themselves off in the company of a truly beautiful girl.\n\nShe added: \u2018It is sort of like hitchhiking. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u2019\n\nSome social media users have accused Ju Peng of being a prostitute. Prostitution is the trade of sex for payment, so the line between free love and sex trade is blurry here. In China, prostitution is illegal but widely accepted.\n\nSource:http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/sex-hitchhiker-countrywide-tour-plans-4517920\n\n\nTitle: Chinese Backparker [Ju Peng] Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nYoutube Link: http://youtu.be/6zvvna2_IkQ\n\n\nextra tags:\nJu Peng Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nJu Peng Offers Sex For Travel in China\nJu Peng Offers Sex For Travel\nJu Peng Offers Sex\nChinese Student Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nChinese Student Offers Sex For Travel in China\nChinese Student Offers Sex For Travel\nChinese Student Offers Sex\nChinese Student In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nChinese Student In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel in China\nChinese Student In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel\nChinese Student In Weibo Offers Sex\nChinese Backpacker Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nChinese Backpacker Offers Sex For Travel in China\nChinese Backpacker Offers Sex For Travel\nChinese Backpacker Offers Sex\nChinese Backpacker In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nChinese Backpacker In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel in China\nChinese Backpacker In Weibo Offers Sex For Travel\nChinese Backpacker In Weibo Offers Sex\nChinese Hitch-hiker Offers Sex For Travel Around China\nChinese Hitch-hiker Offers Sex For Travel in China\nChinese Hitch-hiker Offers Sex For Travel\nChinese Hitch-hiker Offers Sex", "title": "Chinese Backpacker [Ju Peng] Offers Sex For Travel Around China", "publishedDate": "2014-10-28T10:43:09.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zwCLorSsHk", "description": "Een van de vele zeldzame duinpaddenstoelen van Hollands Duin", "title": "GesteeldeStuifbal", "publishedDate": "2011-11-27T09:30:00.000Z"}, {"_id": "6zwN5aJTY-Y", "description": "Block, Need your thumb print....

Under the 2007 Energy Independence & Security Act, Congress required that fuel blenders incorporate increasingly large volumes of ethanol into U.S. vehicle fuels. While adequate supplies exist of conventional ethanol refined from corn, there's also a separate requirement for ethanol from cellulosic sources--using feedstocks that could range from switchgrasses to perhaps even municipal waste streams.

Instead of just throwing all of your food in a bag, follow these 10 safety tips.\n\nIn general, keep the foods that you are going to cook in one type of bag, and the foods that you are not going to cook in another bag.\nIf possible, pack foods of the same temperature together to avoid spoilage or contamination. For example, place all of the frozen foods in one bag, refrigerated foods in another, and room temperature foods, or produce, in another.  Separating these foods also makes it easier to put your groceries away.\nBe sure to get perishable items such as meat and dairy into the refrigerator as soon as possible. Bacteria can reach dangerous levels in two hours at room temperature. Just because it's cold outside, the temperature inside your car might be warmer, especially if you've had the heater running. If you absolutely have to leave groceries in your car, keep them in a cooler with ice packs inside your car to keep them cold until you get home.\nPack similar foods together to avoid cross contamination--the transfer of pathogens or allergens between one food and another.\nNever pack meats with raw fruits and vegetables or other foods you are going to eat raw as meat pathogens can easily transfer to and contaminate produce.\nKeep eggs separate from foods that you're going to eat raw, in case the eggs crack.\nSome reusable, thermal bags can keep foods hot or cold for up to a couple of hours.  Make sure these bags are free from holes or tears.\nIf you're using your own reusable bag.  It's important to wrap meats in a separate bag before placing them in a reusable bag in order to avoid spreading pathogens in these bags.\nIf you only have one bag, place meats on the bottom of the bag within a plastic bag that is tied at the top, and fruits, vegetables and other items that won't be cooked on the top. And next time, don't forget to bring another bag!\nKeep reusable bags clean. Wipe them out, or even throw them in the washing machine on a regular basis, to keep them germ free.\nSource: Jennifer McEntire, PhD, IFT Spokesperson.\nGo to IFT.org for more information.", "title": "What are some food safety tips for bagging groceries?", "publishedDate": "2014-01-22T18:41:20.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-1Jozhm5qw", "description": "My Movie", "title": "My Movie", "publishedDate": "2012-09-04T16:01:05.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-1UVlEsZUI", "description": "http://www.BeadReamer.net This tutorial video shows how to use a bead reamer to clean swarovski pearls.", "title": "Jewelry Making Tutorial - How to Use a Bead Reamer", "publishedDate": "2008-12-17T19:06:16.000Z"}, {"_id": "7-1bwDoxJ3Y", "description": "Tao\u00efstische Tai Chi\u2122 interne kunsten voor gezondheid is een vorm van Tai Chi die specifiek gericht is op het bevorderen van gezondheid en vitaliteit.

This is one of the many train rides we hope to take while basing ourselves in Chiang Mai for several months.  \n\nWhen faced with the decision of spending less money on a bus ticket or taking a train, we often splurge a little for the comfort of a train ride; personally, I find the swerving, honking and cramped seats of a bus in Thailand a less than stellar option.  \n\nAs we boarded we couldn't help but notice the train was nearly empty; ironically, the first travel agent we visited to purchase a ticket told us it had been sold out.  These kinds of dodgy operators are unfortunately far too prevalent in Chiang Mai.  If you ever encounter somebody giving you advice that doesn't seem legit we recommend visiting at least several places before making an informed decision.  The lady trying to sell us a ticket informed us that ALL of the trains had sold out - aside from a lower class sitting compartment - that arrived in Bangkok at some ungodly hour in the morning.  She then proceeded to try and sell us a bus ticket that would have been twice the going rate for an overnight trip.  As an experienced traveler, I could see through her attempts to rip me off; however, I truly wonder how many younger backpackers, embarking upon their first trip overseas, she's been able to fool.   \n\nThe entire experience of taking an overnight train in Thailand certainly trumps taking a bus in terms of facilities and creature comforts.  Being able to sit down in the dining cart people watching and listening to karaoke on movies was one of the top highlights.  One particular man had an entire bottle of whiskey and a massive plate of food in front of him that he was gorging on nearly non-stop.  \n\nAs we looked out the window the refreshing breeze tossed our hair to the side as rural sections of farmland gave way to urban activity.  \n\nThe sleeper berth itself was very cozy with a mattress and pillow provided.  We both found the rocking back and forth motion of the train conducive to a good nights sleep.  \n\nWhen we woke up in Bangkok we felt refreshed and excited to be visiting the city together as a couple for the first time.  We're in Bangkok for a few days to attend a big digital and travel conference in the Silom area of Bangkok.  We'll be put up at the Pullman Bangkok G Hotel for several days while attending various sessions related to travel, travel blogging and working with major brands.  It's an exciting time for us because we're trying our best to transition from teachers in South Korea to digital nomads on the road.  We hope to meet and partner with a lot of different tourism boards and brands - including Bhutan and Air New Zealand - who plan on being there:\n\nhttp://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/train-ride-from-chiang-mai-to-bangkok\n\nhttp://nomadicsamuel.com/travel-stories/train-derailment-bangkok-chiang-mai\n\n\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e27\u0e34\u0e14\u0e35\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e19\u0e33\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2f\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07 14 \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27\u0e42\u0e21\u0e07 \u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e43\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e02\u0e35\u0e48\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\u0e48 basing \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\n\n\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e15\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e08\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e25\u0e07\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e01\u0e08\u0e30 splurge \u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01 \u0e46 \u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e46 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e14\u0e27\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f; \u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e41\u0e15\u0e23, \u0e40\u0e25\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22\u0e27\u0e41\u0e04\u0e1a\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e16\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Thailand series.
